    "an overdensity of photometrically selected f turnoff stars near the galactic anti - center was first reported by @xcite .",
    "these stars were selected to be bluer than the turnoff of the thick disk , as defined by local populations , and have an inferred distance from the sun of 11 - 16 kpc . over - densities of stars",
    "were detected in four places , named by galactic longitude , galactic latitude , and apparent magnitude in the sdss g filter : s223 + 20 - 119.4 , s218 + 22 - 19.5 , s183 + 22 - 19.4 , and ( with less significance ) s200 - 24 - 19.8 .",
    "two possible explanations for these overdensities were given : a tidal stream , or an `` even thicker disk '' with a scale height of 2 kpc and a scale length around 10 kpc .",
    "the detections spanned a range of constellations , so the overdensity was named by a large constellation near the center of the detections monoceros .    in @xcite",
    ", evidence was presented that the stars were part of a ring of stars that encircle the galaxy , and the observations were interpreted as evidence that the stars were from a tidally disrupted satellite galaxy .",
    "the argument was based primarily on the small radial velocity dispersion ( @xmath6 km s@xmath3 ) of the stars in the structures .",
    "this dispersion was similar to the dispersion measured for the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy tidal stream , and much smaller than that measured locally for the thin disk , thick disk or halo .",
    "in addition , standard exponential models for the thin and thick disks predicted far fewer star counts in this region of the galaxy than were observed .",
    "note also that the measured metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath7 and turnoff color of @xmath8 are similar to the stellar halo and not the thick disk .",
    "the evidence in this paper that suggested a thick disk origin for these stars included a stellar distribution that was circularly symmetric about the galactic center , a circulation velocity that was not significantly different from the thick disk , and a density distribution that fit an exponential ( with a vertical scale height of @xmath9 kpc ) as a function of height above the plane . at nearly the same time",
    ", @xcite announced the `` one ring to encompass them all '' , extending the observed galactic longitudes at which the structure was detected , and favoring its interpretation as a disk perturbation with a vertical scale height of @xmath10 kpc .",
    "following these papers , a flurry of new papers hinted at either a disk or a satellite origin for the ``ring '' of stars .",
    "@xcite showed that dwarf galaxy ``satellites '' on orbits nearly coplanar to the disk can form ringlike stellar structures as tidal arcs or shells , and hinted that these minor mergers contribute to building the disk component of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite argued that the excess of stars on the `` ring '' could be associated with a ringlike overdensity of dark matter ( a caustic ) that can lead to an overdensity of disk stars .",
    "the caustic rings for our galaxy are predicted to be near 40 kpc n@xmath3 , where n is an integer , so the relevant caustic for observed structure is @xmath11 .",
    "there might be observational evidence for such rings of dark matter in the rotation curve of the milky way @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that there existed a large group of m giant stars near the anti - center at the same distance as the `` ring '' that extends from @xmath12 . at @xmath13",
    ", the overdensity may be closer to the galactic center so that it appears to merge with the disk .",
    "the m giant stars are not equidistant from the galactic center , are thicker in some places than others , and appear to have a larger vertical scale height near @xmath14 .",
    "the presence of m giants indicates a younger , more metal rich population in this structure , supporting the hypothesis that the structure is the remains of the dwarf galaxy with a range of stellar populations rather than a perturbation of the thick disk .",
    "@xcite further measured a metallicity for the m giant stars of [ fe / h]@xmath15 and identified four globular clusters of lower mean metallicity that may be associated with the structure , bolstering the claim for a range of metallicities .",
    "their measurement of a line - of - sight , galactic standard of rest velocity of @xmath16 km s@xmath3 at a galactic longitude of nearly @xmath17 indicates the structure has a slightly non - circular orbit .",
    "@xcite found 15 old open clusters that appear to form a linear structure that starts near the anti - center , 20 kpc from the center of the galaxy , and comes closer to the galactic center as it traverses quadrants iii and iv , approaching 6 kpc from the galactic center when it is on the opposite side of the galactic center from the sun .",
    "searches for bhb star substructure in the anti - center were largely unsuccessful @xcite .",
    "the discussion of the origin of the overdensity in the anti - center became more heated when martin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) announced the discovery of the canis major dwarf galaxy , at @xmath18 .",
    "they argued that this dwarf galaxy was the likely progenitor of the ``ring - like structure '' .",
    "however , both the nature of the canis major dwarf galaxy and its association with the monoceros ring , as it came to be known , were controversial .",
    "many articles argued in favor of its identity as a dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "others claimed the purported dwarf galaxy was an artifact of the galactic warp or a spiral arm .",
    "@xcite claimed that the core of the canis major dwarf galaxy was a reddening artifact , and that the low latitude stellar overdensity actually extended over a larger area in the argo constellation ; this larger overdensity was thought to be a dwarf galaxy or disrupting dwarf galaxy , and could have caused the observed warp in hi gas .",
    "the triangulum - andromeda ( tri - and ) over - density @xcite was discovered in the @xmath19 , @xmath20 region , @xmath21 kpc from the sun .",
    "these stars have a narrow velocity dispersion , and a velocity trend that matches the anti - center m giants in @xcite . however , the tri - and stars are more distant than the crane et al .",
    "m giants , and have a lower metallicity , leading rocha - pinto et al . to wonder whether the tri - and stars are a more distant wrap of the same tidal stream .",
    "@xcite measure titanium , yttrium , lanthanum , and iron abundances of the tri - and structure , and conclude that the measurements are consistent with the chemical enrichment of a dwarf galaxy such as sagittarius , but that it may not be the same dwarf galaxy as the low latitude anti - center structure .",
    "@xcite created a semianalytic n - body simulation of a dwarf galaxy disruption that more or less fit all of the positions in which the anti - center structure had been detected , including the more distant tri - andromeda overdensity .",
    "the fit was done in sky position , velocity , and distance to previously detected stellar overdensities .",
    "one fact to keep in mind here is that most of the `` detections '' of substructure near the galactic anti - center did not identify a center of the stellar distribution .",
    "the observations showed an excess of stars in a particular location , but there could have been a larger excess at a higher or ( more likely ) lower galactic latitude .",
    "this simulation and fit to the data could not predict with certainty whether or not the reported canis major dwarf galaxy was the likely progenitor of the presumed tidal debris .",
    "positions of additional over - densities of stars ( and low latitude positions with non - detections ) , identified by an unexpected population of stars with a blue turnoff in h - r diagrams were presented by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the over - densities of stars were detected both above and below the galactic plane .",
    "@xcite identified two groups of stars at @xmath22 and @xmath23 as monoceros stream candidates by their proper motions .",
    "@xcite confirmed the presence of an extra `` ring of stars '' above and below the galactic plane at @xmath24,@xmath25 , and @xmath26 , but not at @xmath27 . because the excess stars are detected both above and below the galactic plane , it is difficult to explain the excess stars as resulting from a disk warp .",
    "@xcite identified a ``three - stream complex '' ( also dubbed the anti - center stream , acs ) in the anti - center region that was thought to be the result of tidal disruption of a dwarf galaxy of significant size and mass ( including globular clusters that are now disrupted ) .",
    "the distance , nearly circular orbit , and main sequence turnoff color of this complex is similar to the `` monoceros ring '' .",
    "however , the orbit of the debris , derived by @xcite based on sky positions , distances , and radial velocities in two fields overlapping the stream , is tilted with respect to the plane of the milky way , so the orbit fit does not pass through either monoceros or canis major .",
    "it is therefore identified as a separate structure .",
    "one complication that was not identified is that the original detection of the ``monoceros ring '' in @xcite was not really in monoceros , either .",
    "the @xcite paper identified three overdensities in the anti - center that were thought to be related , describing an area 40 degrees across and spanning many constellations .",
    "monoceros was a large constellation near the center of the three observed overdensities and close to the clearest of them .",
    "the overdensity that was most clearly identified as a tidal stream was at @xmath28 , which is right on the acs . @xcite",
    "measured three - dimensional kinematics of stream star candidates at @xmath29 , a position near the edge of the acs as depicted in @xcite , and found a velocity that is more parallel to the plane than along the stream direction .",
    "@xcite also discovered another higher latitude overdensity he called the eastern banded structure ( ebs ) , near @xmath30 .",
    "although this might have been associated with the acs , @xcite revisits this structure and concludes the tidal debris is on an eccentric orbit that passes close to both the galactic center and the sun .    the debate over whether the monoceros ring is a general feature of the disk , a disrupted satellite , or a feature of the disk created by a satellite disruption is still far from over .",
    "@xcite show that a high eccentricity ``fly - by '' of a dwarf galaxy could form dynamically cold rings of stars around the milky way .",
    "this suggestion seems inconsistent with the later measurements of the titanium , yttrium , and lanthanum abundances by @xcite , which show that 21 anti - center m giant stars have elemental abundances similar to the sgr dwarf tidal tails , and not similar to milky way stars of similar overall metallicity .",
    "note , however , that the sgr dwarf tidal stream is populated by many bhb stars @xcite , while the low latitude stream is practically devoid of these stars @xcite , so the two stellar populations clearly differ at low metallicity . since the @xcite stars are spread over a large part of the sky , one also wonders whether they are all drawn from the same structure .",
    "@xcite show deep imaging of the anti - center region at @xmath31 and @xmath32 that shows a very narrow main sequence at 9 kpc from the sun .",
    "they conclude it is not consistent with recent galactic models that include flares and warps .",
    "further @xcite conclude,``in the absence of an ` ad hoc ' abrupt disk cutoff , the photometric signature of the mon ring can not be explained by any smooth variation of the galactic disk structure . ''",
    "@xcite point out that the sgr dwarf galaxy crosses the galactic plane at approximately the distance of the monoceros ring , 20 kpc from the galactic center , and that therefore a satellite progenitor of the ring could have had its orbit circularized by an interaction with the sgr dwarf galaxy .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggest that ring - like wrappings of spiral arms could be excited in the disk in response to the infall of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy itself .",
    "have found a disk flare model that fits f and g star counts towards the anti - center .",
    "in this paper we will use photometry and spectroscopy of stars in the northern hemisphere of the galaxy , towards the galactic anti - center , to show that the anti - center contains more than one low - latitude substructure . in section 2",
    ", we identify the substructures photometrically . in section 3",
    ", we measure the properties of stars that we expect to be thick disk stars , and show that they look very much like the values found elsewhere in the literature . in section 4",
    ", we use spectroscopy to measure the properties of the anti - center structures . in section 5 , we show that our line - of - sight velocities , distances , and proper motions are consistent with the @xcite orbit fit to the acs . in section 6 , we discuss the properties of the three identified substructures , using the historical names @xcite : monoceros ring , anti - center stream ( acs ) , and eastern banded structure ( ebs ) . in section 7 , we summarize the conclusions .",
    "the three substructures we identify are at nearly the same distance from the sun in the anti - center , but have slightly different kinematics , metallicities , and positions in the sky .",
    "previous measurements , explanations , and naming schemes should be re - visited in light of the fact that there are clearly multiple substructures at low latitude near the galactic anti - center , 20 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "additionally , we argue that none of these structures are likely to be part of the thick disk , because we do find a few stars with the kinematics and metallicity we expect for thick disk stars .",
    "the `` anti - center stream '' , `` monoceros ring '' and `` eastern banded structure '' all have significantly lower velocity dispersion than the thick disk .",
    "the data in this paper are taken from the sloan digital sky survey data release 8 , ( sdss dr8 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we first explore the best color range to select stars that are part of an extended structure near the galactic anti - center .",
    "@xcite reported a turnoff magnitude for this structure of @xmath33 , so we concentrate on stars of about this apparent magnitude . here , and throughout this paper , the subscript `` 0 '' indicates the magnitudes have been corrected for extinction , using the @xcite reddening maps , in sdss dr8 .",
    "we used the extinction values from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sfd ) that are provided in the sdss database , without applying the @xmath34 corrections to sfd derived by @xcite . because nearly all of the data presented here are in relatively extinction - free regions , the difference between the two extinction values should have virtually no effect on our work . for the acs and ebs regions studied here , @xmath35 , which amounts to a difference in @xmath36 between the sfd and @xcite values of @xmath37 magnitudes .",
    "this in turn amounts to only a @xmath38 correction to measured distances , which is small compared to the uncertainties in distance measurements reported in this work .",
    "( even at lower latitudes where monoceros is located , the effect on measured distances is less than @xmath39 . ) we note also that corrections of @xmath40 have little effect on color - selected samples employed in this work .",
    "@xcite showed that the completeness for @xmath41 is not a significant issue in the sdss image data , and @xcite showed that color errors do not dramatically affect the star counts for stars selected in a narrow color range at magnitudes brighter than @xmath42 , so we do not correct for completeness in our analysis .",
    "we also assume throughout this paper that the absolute magnitude of the turnoff stars is @xmath43 , as @xcite showed was typical for low metallicity stellar populations in the milky way .",
    "figure 1 shows the density of anti - center @xmath44 and @xmath45 sources selected from `` star '' in sdss dr8 .",
    "this `` star '' selection ensures that we have only one instance of each stellar object , and that all of our objects are point sources .",
    "the @xmath46 cut removes most quasars from the sample .",
    "stars bluer than @xmath47 are evenly distributed on the sky .",
    "stars with @xmath48 show a faint , irregular structure ( or possibly more than one structure ) with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , with no data for @xmath51 .",
    "stars with @xmath52 show both a significant density near the galactic plane ( @xmath53 ) and an extended group of stars well above the plane extending `` diagonally '' across the lower - left panel from @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "this feature corresponds to the so - called anti - center stream ( acs ) from @xcite . in this plot and with low resolution",
    "we do not observe the `` banding '' of tributaries found by @xcite .",
    "there is also an overdensity near @xmath56 that was identified as the eastern banded structure ( ebs ) by @xcite .",
    "figure 1 is consistent with a slightly bluer turnoff for stars at higher galactic longitude in this substructure .",
    "redder @xmath57 stars at @xmath58 show a concentration of stars at low latitudes , as one would expect for thick disk stars .",
    "the very blue turnoff color of the distant , high latitude stars is consistent with the results of previous authors . throughout this paper ,",
    "we will concentrate on stars with @xmath52 , because this is the color range that appears to show significant high latitude structure in the photometry .    in figure 2",
    "we show the magnitude distribution of stars in the bluer color range which is populated primarily by the anti - center substructure , @xmath52 , and in the redder color range that includes turnoff stars in the thick disk , @xmath57 .",
    "the gray scale is kept constant as a function of apparent magnitude , so that the relative number of stars at each magnitude can be compared . among the bluer @xmath52 stars ,",
    "the anti - center substructure is clearly dominant at @xmath44 ; it is visible but much fainter at @xmath59 , and completely disappears fainter than @xmath60 . in the bluer @xmath61 panel ,",
    "one can see the leading sagittarius dwarf tidal tail @xcite arcing down towards the galactic plane , more distant than the `` monoceros ring '' .",
    "the right panel of figure 2 shows stars with the colors of the thick disk turnoff .",
    "these stars are present at all magnitude ranges . at bright apparent magnitudes",
    "the thick disk extends to higher galactic latitudes because these brighter stars are closer to the sun .",
    "additionally , the density of thick disk stars should decrease with increasing distance from the galactic center ( which is closely correlated with distance from the sun when looking towards the galactic anti - center at low latitudes ) .",
    "the density of thick - disk stars is decreasing from @xmath62 to @xmath60 .",
    "then , in the @xmath61 panel , we see both an increase in stars at low - latitude ( @xmath53 ) and stars from the higher - latitude anti - center substructure  presumably fainter , lower mass main sequence stars .",
    "there is also a hint of structure at the same sky location as the sagittarius leading tidal tail .",
    "if the anti - center substructure arises from a warp and/or a flare of the thick disk , then the warp and/or flare happens to contain stars of a different stellar population than the nearer portions of that thick disk .",
    "let s assume for a moment that the bluer and redder stars are from the same populations .",
    "figure 3 shows the number of stars binned by @xmath63 color and @xmath64 apparent magnitude .",
    "the overdensity at @xmath33 in the bluest color bin is apparent at @xmath65 at @xmath66 , at @xmath67 at @xmath68 , and at @xmath69 at @xmath70 .",
    "we assume other stellar populations will have similar main sequence slopes .",
    "so we compare 1400 stars per bin at@xmath71 with 4000 stars per bin at @xmath72 .",
    "there are a factor of three fewer blue stars than red stars in this population we associate with the thick disk . therefore , if the anti - center substructure has a similar stellar population , then 3600 stars per bin at @xmath73 should translate to 10,000 stars per bin at @xmath74 . instead",
    ", we only have 5000 stars per bin there , and a much smaller fraction of these redder stars appear to be associated with the narrow substructure .",
    "evidently , the thick disk and anti - center substructure(s ) have different stellar populations .",
    "the discontinuity in stellar population is clearly apparent in the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) in figure 4 . from figure 2",
    ", we noticed that the anti - center substructure has a higher density component at @xmath53 , and a lower density , tilted component at higher latitude . in figure 4 we show cmds for lower and higher parts of the sky , with @xmath75 , and an even lower part of the sky including all available data with @xmath76 . both of the lower latitude cmds have a higher density , but very similar structure to the higher latitude cmd . at @xmath77 , the turnoff of",
    "the thick disk is redder than @xmath78 .",
    "brighter than @xmath79 magnitude , there exist some bluer stars , but it is not clear whether that is a trend or whether it is due to a separate population ( for example from the thin disk or other disk substructure ) that is mixed with the thick disk in this region .",
    "assuming these bright stars are main sequence turnoff stars , they are closer than 2 kpc from the sun , and are about a half to one kpc from the galactic plane . at @xmath77 ,",
    "the density of thick disk turnoff stars is clearly diminishing , due to increasing distance from the galactic center , increasing distance from the galactic plane , or ( most likely ) both .",
    "fainter than @xmath77 , we see a very high density main sequence that has a bluer turnoff color than the thick disk , which if anything has been getting redder with increasing apparent magnitude . in the cmd",
    ", this happens very discontinuously .",
    "the turnoff color and apparent magnitude are identical for the lower latitude and middle latitude portions ( in the left and middle panels of figure 4 ) of the substructure .",
    "the turnoff color and magnitude were determined by selecting apparent magnitude bins of width 0.2 at a variety of magnitudes near the turnoff , and fitting three gaussians to the histograms of star counts as a function of color .",
    "the center of the apparent magnitude range yielding the bluest fit to the peak of the gaussian is @xmath80 for the left and center panels of figure 4 .",
    "the color of the blue peak is @xmath81 for the left panel , and @xmath82 for the center panel .",
    "these cmds are very similar to those in figure  12 of @xcite , which depicts data near @xmath83 , and similar low latitude cmds near the anti - center made by many authors since then .",
    "the higher latitude turnoff ( right panel in fig .",
    "4 ) appears to be very slightly bluer than the middle and lower stellar populations . to measure the turnoff magnitude and color , we selected stars in 0.2 magnitude wide slices from figure 4 .",
    "a histogram of the @xmath63 colors in this narrow magnitude range was fit with three gaussians : one represented the turnoff of the substructure , one represented the red m dwarfs , and the third very wide gaussian more or less fit the range of main sequence stars in the middle color range .",
    "this resulted in a very crude fit to the data , but since the bluest gaussian seemed to fit the turnoff stars well using this scheme , it was used to measure the color of the turnoff as a function of apparent magnitude .",
    "these apparent magnitude slices were shifted brighter and fainter in 0.1 magnitude increments until the bluest of the three gaussian fits ( the one corresponding to the turnoff of the substructure ) was the bluest of the fits at any magnitude .",
    "the apparent magnitude of the center of the bluest slice was adopted as the turnoff magnitude , and the color of the bluest fit was adopted as the turnoff color .",
    "the results for the three panels of figure 4 were : @xmath84 and @xmath85 for panels 1 , 2,and 3 , respectively .",
    "the `` anti - center stream '' is indeed slightly bluer and farther away than the `` monoceros ring '' .",
    "we wish to compare the velocities and metallicities of the stars in the identified anti - center substructure with stars that are in the thick disk .",
    "we start by examining the line - of - sight , galactic standard of rest velocities ( @xmath86 ) for stars with spectra in sdss dr8 that have @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath44 , and @xmath89 in figure 5 .",
    "we used the `` bright normalization '' in figure 3 of @xcite to estimate the absolute magnitude of thick disk stars of this color to be @xmath90 . at @xmath91 , the implied distance to these stars",
    "this is the distance used to calculate the expected velocity of the thick disk in this figure .",
    "note that the velocities and metallicities agree with our expectations for thick disk stars @xcite .",
    "we next study the metallicity distribution of stars with @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath44 , and which have velocities within 50 km s@xmath3 of the expected velocity for thick disk stars , in different color ranges .",
    "figure 4 guides us in understanding from which component these stars are likely to be drawn .",
    "figure 6 shows the metallicity distribution for @xmath52 ( low latitude substructure ) , @xmath66 ( may include a combination of the low latitude substructure and thick disk ) , @xmath68 ( mostly thick disk ) , and @xmath70 ( thick disk ) .    the bluest stars , which are part of the low latitude substructure , have a metallicity near [ fe / h]@xmath92 . stars with colors @xmath89 have a metallicity near [ fe / h]@xmath93 , significantly higher than the low latitude substructure . in between , at @xmath66 ,",
    "the stars are plausibly a combination of thick disk stars with a mean of [ fe / h]@xmath93 and substructure stars which have a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath92 .",
    "we do not believe that this transitional color range indicates that there is a gradient in the metallicity of the thick disk , because the cmd in figure 4 shows a discontinuous transition in density at this color , and the color box includes parts of each distribution . in all color ranges",
    "there is a tail of much lower metallicity stars which are stars from the stellar halo that happen to have line - of - sight velocities close to those of the thick disk .    in figure 7",
    "we show the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the thick disk as measured from spectra of anti - center stars with @xmath94 , @xmath88 , @xmath44 , and @xmath89 and [ fe / h]@xmath95 .",
    "as discussed earlier , these stars are about 6 kpc from the sun , or 14 kpc from the center of the milky way , somewhat closer to the galactic center than the anti - center substructure at about 20 kpc from the galactic center . for each star , we subtracted the expected line - of - sight velocity for a thick disk star at its position from the measured @xmath86 .",
    "we fit a single gaussian centered at 0.0 km s@xmath3 to the residuals , and derived a velocity dispersion for the thick disk of @xmath96 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the only other fit parameter was the square - root of the amplitude , which was found to be @xmath97 counts@xmath98 .",
    "in this section we select spectra from sdss dr8 in the anti - center region .",
    "figure 8 shows a density map of all sdss dr8 stellar spectra .",
    "the density of spectra is substantially higher where segue and segue-2 plates were observed .",
    "spectroscopic plates have a radius of 1.49and take 640 simultaneous spectra , each with wavelength coverage @xmath99   and spectral resolution of @xmath100 .",
    "segue and segue-2 generally obtained one faint plate and one bright plate at each selected location .",
    "the target selection methods were quite complex and varied with time , so it can be challenging to use the data for statistical studies .",
    "however , we will be selecting a small range of color and magnitude near the faint end of the spectroscopic survey , so the overall selection criteria will primarily affect only the number of spectra on each plate . in section 2",
    "we used the photometry to study the relative densities of stars , and in this section we will use the spectra to measure the velocities and metallicities of the stars in the substructure(s ) .",
    "we studied the properties of the anti - center structures in 34 positions in the sky , identified in figure 8 and tabulated in table 1 . because the sets of plates could potentially be sampling different structures at different latitudes",
    ", we separated them into `` higher '' , `` middle '' , and `` lower '' parts based on galactic latitude .",
    "the lower part consists of regions with centers between @xmath101 , the middle regions have centers between @xmath102 , and the higher regions are those at @xmath103 .",
    "the designation of each plate to one of these groups is described in figure 8 and table 1 .",
    "table 1 lists in degrees the geometric center of each selected region , the width of each region in galactic longitude and latitude , and the average position of the spectra in that region that have @xmath44 and @xmath52 .",
    "also listed is the number of spectra with @xmath44 and @xmath52 .    the segue stellar parameter pipeline ( sspp ; @xcite ) processes the wavelength and flux - calibrated spectra generated by the standard sdss spectroscopic reduction pipeline @xcite , and estimates stellar effective temperature , surface gravity , metallicity and heliocentric radial velocity .",
    "for each star , we calculated the line - of - sight , galactic standard of rest values from the heliocentric radial velocities ( rv ) using the formula : @xmath104    which removes the contribution of the 220 km s@xmath3 rotation velocity at the solar circle as well as the solar peculiar motion ( relative to the local standard of rest ) of @xmath105 km s@xmath3 @xcite .    in the section 2",
    ", we showed that the best magnitude and color range to select the anti - center substructure is @xmath52 and @xmath44 .",
    "in addition to these criteria , we removed bad data from the sdss catalogs by selecting only spectra with @xmath106 ( if radial velocities are not measured then @xmath107 is zero ) , @xmath108|<10 $ ] dex ( outside this range the metallicity is clearly incorrect or unmeasured ) , and that were not missing a magnitude measurement in g or r ( resulting in @xmath109 ) .",
    "this left us with 1300 spectra to analyze . in this paper",
    "all metallicities were obtained from the fehspec field in the sppparams table of sdss dr8 .",
    "fehspec is the adopted value of the metallicity , using a weighted average of other spectroscopic methods .",
    "this does not include photometric methods of measuring metallicity .",
    "figure 9 shows the sdss dr8 [ fe / h ] vs. line - of - sight , galactic standard of rest velocity for all of the stars in our 34 selected regions , separated by latitude ranges to show , from left to right , the higher , middle , and lower - part data .",
    "the plots clearly show that the low metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath110 ) stars in all three latitude ranges have large ( @xmath111 km s@xmath3 ) velocity dispersions expected from a stellar halo population . at higher metallicity , [ fe / h]@xmath112 , there are apparently a few halo stars but most have a much narrower range of line - of - sight velocities .    in figure 10 , we show the metallicity distribution of blue @xmath113 $ ] , @xmath114 stars having velocities within 50 km s@xmath3 of the expected thick - disk @xmath86 along each line of sight for the higher , middle , and lower sets of spectra .",
    "we limit the velocity range in order to reduce the number of spheroid stars as much as possible .",
    "there are two clear groups : one with low metallicity that matches our expectations for the stellar halo , and a group of stars with metallicities of @xmath115 [ fe / h ] @xmath116 .",
    "one can see in the lower two panels that the middle and lower spectra , with @xmath117 , have a narrow range of metallicities centered at [ fe / h]@xmath92 .",
    "however , the higher spectra ( @xmath103 ) have a broader metallicity peak near [ fe / h]@xmath118 , significantly lower than the lower latitude spectra .",
    "we fit two gaussians to the metallicity histogram for the 213 higher galactic latitude spectra in figure 10 .",
    "the stellar halo gaussian is centered at [ fe / h]@xmath119 with a sigma of 0.18 .",
    "the stream(s ) are fit with a gaussian centered at [ fe / h]@xmath120 and a sigma of 0.31 . there were not enough halo stars in the middle and lower panels to fit two gaussians well , so we calculated the mean and standard deviation of the metallicity from stars around the peak . in the middle part we used metallicities from -1.3 to -0.5 , and in the lower part we used metallicities from -1.1 to -0.5 . from these , we find mean metallicities of @xmath121[fe / h]@xmath122 \\pm [ 0.01 , 0.02]$ ] for the middle and lower parts , respectively .",
    "the sigma of these distributions is found to be 0.20 , and 0.19 dex , respectively .",
    "thus , the metallicity distribution of the higher part overlaps those of the middle and lower stars , but with a statistically significant offset in the mean .",
    "we now explore the velocities of the stars in the anti - center substructure .",
    "figure 11 includes nine subsets of our spectroscopic data , separated by three metallicity bins ( red lines in figure 9 ) and three ranges of galactic latitude .",
    "the low metallicity subsets of the middle and higher latitude data look as we would expect for galactic halo populations a large ( @xmath111 km s@xmath3 ) dispersion centered on @xmath123 km s@xmath3 .    in the higher metallicity panels , we show the expected velocities of a thick disk with a circular rotation speed of 170 km s@xmath3 and assuming the stars are 10 kpc from the sun @xcite .",
    "we calculated this curve using the following formula : @xmath124 @xmath125}\\ ] ] @xmath126 where 8 kpc is the adopted distance from the sun to the galactic center ; d is the distance to the observed star ( in this case 10 kpc ) ; r is the distance from the galactic center ; `` a '' is the angle between the sun and the observed star , as viewed from the galactic center ; @xmath127 is the adopted rotation speed of the thick disk ( in this case 170 km s@xmath3 ) ; and @xmath128 is the predicted line - of - sight , galactic standard of rest velocity of the observed star in km s@xmath3 , assuming it is in the thick disk .    in the higher latitude , middle metallicity dataset , we see a very narrow velocity dispersion substructure in the range @xmath129 .",
    "the line - of - sight velocities in this range are significantly higher than we expect from the thick disk . in particular , the line - of - sight velocity at @xmath14 is positive , not zero .",
    "all axisymmetric disk models predict a zero line - of - sight velocity directly towards the anti - center , independent of rotation speed and distance to the stars , because at that longitude we are looking exactly perpendicular to the circular motion of the disk . at @xmath130 , there are many fewer spectra , and they appear to be consistent with the velocity of the thick disk , with a dispersion that is believably similar to expectations . at @xmath131 ,",
    "the velocity dispersion appears noticeably narrower , but with average line - of - sight velocities consistent with the thick disk .",
    "these observations are quantified in the top two rows of panels in figure 12 .",
    "we divided the middle metallicity , higher galactic latitude data up by numbered region , ignoring regions with fewer than ten spectra .",
    "we then fit two gaussians to the velocity histogram of those data .",
    "one of the gaussians represents the thick disk , with a fixed central @xmath86 and @xmath132 km s@xmath3(as derived in section  3 ) ; only the height was allowed to vary .",
    "the other gaussian represents a separate velocity substructure ; the height , mean , and sigma of this gaussian were all allowed to vary .",
    "these fits were sometimes sensitive to local minima in chi - squared values , especially when the structure mean and thick disk means were nearly identical , so a metropolis - hastings markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique @xcite was used to sweep out the parameter space near the fit in order to produce truly minimized best fits .",
    "a hessian matrix , calculated at the best - fit parameters , provided the errors in the parameter fit values .",
    "the hessian matrix was multiplied by 2 and inverted , so that the square root of the diagonal elements gave the parameter variances .",
    "the results of fitting two gaussians are given in table 2 .",
    "the columns are : the name of the region ; the expected velocity of the thick disk , in km s@xmath3 , assuming the stars are 10 kpc from the sun ; the number of stars fit to the thick disk component ; the error in the number of stars fit to the thick disk ; the mean velocity of the second gaussian fit ; the error in the mean velocity of the second gaussian fit ; the number of stars fit to the second gaussian ; the error in the number of stars fit to the extra gaussian ; the sigma of the second gaussian ; the error in the sigma of the second gaussian ; the mean of the second gaussian fit minus the expected velocity of the thick disk ; the number of velocity standard deviations the mean of the second gaussian is away from the expected velocity of the thick disk ( dev(v ) ) ; the number of stars that were fit ; and the color this region is assigned in figure 13 .",
    "the colors in figure 13 indicate the type of fit result for the velocities : pink  most of the stars are in a narrower gaussian that is significantly shifted from the mean of the thick disk ( more than 2.5 sigma ) ; black  the stars are mostly consistent with our expectations for the thick disk ; green  most of the stars are in a narrower gaussian that is at the same velocity as is expected for the thick disk ; blue  most of the stars are consistent with our expectations for the thick disk , but the distribution is better fit with an additional narrower component that is shifted from the velocity of the thick disk .",
    "the two gaussian fits to h7 and h8 put essentially zero stars in the second gaussian , and produced random numbers for the velocity profile ; these meaningless numbers were deleted from the table to avoid confusion .",
    "m13 could have been included in the pink category rather than the green category ; there are so many spectra in this region that the formal errors on the velocity are tiny , so even though the velocity offset is less than 6 km s@xmath3 , it is 2.7 sigma from the thick disk velocity .",
    "since the systematic errors can be as large as 5 km s@xmath3 , we included this region in the green category , meaning the velocity is not significantly different from our expectations for the thick disk .",
    "m4 was also a borderline region .",
    "we decided to color it black ( consistent with thick disk ) , because although the fit put ten stars in a second gaussian , the error in the number of stars in the second gaussian was larger than that .",
    "region l8 had only 11 spectra in our sample ( barely enough to be included in figure 12 ) .",
    "however , only five of those stars were fit in the two gaussian fit . because the number of stars was so low and the formal fit was not good , this region",
    "was moved to the `` not enough data to fit '' category .",
    "higher regions h1 , h3 , h4 , h5 , and h6 ; and middle regions m7 and m9 , show a narrow ( @xmath133 km s@xmath3 ) velocity peak that is significantly higher in the mean than the expectations for the thick disk ( shown by the green line in figure 12 ) . of the 20 regions with at least 10 spectra in our color - magnitude selection , only two have velocity dispersions that are well fit by a model thick disk ( p - value @xmath1340.7 in table 3 ) .",
    "regions h7 and h8 contain very few spectra of which a large fraction are fit by the model thick disk .",
    "regions h10 , and h11 show narrow peaks that are quite close to the expected mean velocity of the thick disk , but have @xmath133 km s@xmath3  much narrower than the set of spectra in plates h7 and h8 .",
    "this is consistent with observations of the photometric data , as shown in figure 13 .",
    "there are apparently separate high latitude over - densities probed by higher regions h1 , h3 , h4 , h5 , and h6 ; and regions h10 and h11 .",
    "there is no over - density apparent in regions h7 and h8 .    at low latitude , where the photometric data show a relatively large number of stars in our color - magnitude selection box , we find primarily stars that have a narrow velocity dispersion , centered on the velocity expected for circular rotation with the thick disk .",
    "l3 , l4 , m13 and m14 all have sigmas under 20 km s@xmath3 .",
    "m13 in particular has a sigma of @xmath135 km s@xmath3 , which is six standard deviations away from the expected thick disk sigma of 34.6 km s@xmath3 .",
    "if the stars in this low latitude over - density are part of a warp or flare of the thick disk , then the thick disk must not only have a lower metallicity at that distance , but it also would need a significantly lower velocity dispersion .    in the low latitude panels of figure 13 ,",
    "we see a small clump of stars with velocity near @xmath136 km s@xmath3 and galactic longitude near @xmath137 .",
    "we isolated a small tight group of four stars in the intermediate metallicity plot that are within a degree of @xmath138 , have metallicities within @xmath139 dex of @xmath140 , and have a mean velocity of @xmath136 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the mean apparent magnitude is @xmath141 , with a very small range .",
    "the implied distance to these stars is 10 kpc .",
    "the angle from the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , as measured along the stream , is @xmath142 .",
    "these stars are likely members of the sagittarius dwarf leading tidal tail , since the position is directly in line with the tidal tail at higher latitude , and the line - of - sight velocity closely matches the @xcite @xmath143-body simulation of the sagittarius dwarf tidal disruption in a triaxial milky way potential .",
    "these stars are more similar to each other in metallicity and velocity than expected for a dwarf galaxy stream , suggesting these might be a substructure ( for example a remnant of a globular cluster ) within the stream .",
    "the model predicts a distance of 15 kpc rather than 10 kpc , which is worrying though not definitively a contradiction due to the very small sample of f turnoff stars .",
    "these stars might , for example , be part of a tight substructure within the tidal debris stream . although the absolute magnitude of @xmath43 which was used to calculate the distance to these stars is a reasonable estimate for sagittarius @xcite , it is not necessarily a good estimate for a small clump of stars , especially a clump with a relatively high metallicity .",
    "regions m3 , m4 , m7 , m10 , and m11 are in a transition region .",
    "one can see from the data in figure 12 that they arguably include both a narrow population at the thick disk velocity and an additional narrow population at a slightly higher velocity .",
    "when that distribution is fit by a thick disk plus one narrower gaussian , it is possible to get results that have thick disk plus extra higher velocity narrow component ( pink ) ; all thick disk ( black ) ; or thick disk plus a narrow component at the same velocity ( blue ) ; depending on the fraction in each extra population .",
    "the fact that m3 and m7 have a component that has the same velocity as the structure at higher galactic latitude leads us to believe that this higher structure extends at least down to @xmath144 .",
    "the high latitude side of the structure appears to stop abruptly , but the low latitude side is populated by similar stars .    to more rigorously separate the thick disk and this structure , we fit a single free gaussian to the velocity data in these regions .",
    "the results are in table 3 . to further strengthen our argument",
    ", we performed a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test on each region , with the null hypothesis being that the each data set was derived from the thick disk velocity distribution .",
    "the p - values are also listed in table 3 .",
    "not surprisingly , the two regions most consistent with being drawn from the thick disk are h7 and h8 .",
    "these distributions might actually be drawn from the thick disk .",
    "the only regions that might sensibly be drawn from a distribution with the velocity of the thick disk and a sigma on the velocity distribution of 34.6 km s@xmath3 are h6 , h10 , h11 , m3 , m4 , m10 , m11 , and l4 .",
    "all ten other regions have p - values less than 0.1 , implying , for each region , that there is less than a @xmath145 chance of discovering the observed distribution , provided that only thick disk stars are present . these ten regions are then significantly distinct from a region that is dominated by the thick disk , and therefore likely contain structures that are significantly different from the thick disk .",
    "in this section we compare our measurements of the position , distance , and velocities of stars in the acs with the orbit calculated by @xcite .",
    "figure 16 shows the sky positions where we have both spectra and measurements of turnoff star densities .",
    "red points show the positions of stars with the metallicities and velocities that we expect for acs stars .",
    "we used the average latitude and longitude of regions h3 , h4 , h5 , and h6 , as listed in table 1 , as the stream positions .",
    "since m9 is significantly below the northern edge of the acs , and the likely acs stars are near the north end of the spectroscopic region , we used the sky position @xmath146 , which was estimated from the photometry .",
    "regions m13/14 similarly seemed a bit below the top edge of the acs , though it is much harder to tell due to confusion with the monoceros ring .",
    "we used a sky position of @xmath147 for the last datapoint .",
    "we used the @xmath86 and the error in the @xmath86 for each region as tabulated in table 2 . for region",
    "m13/14 , we used average values of v@xmath148 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the green outlined regions in figure 16 were selected to include acs stars and be loosely centered on interesting spectroscopic regions .",
    "we found that stars from the leading tidal tail of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy were pulling our distance measurements farther away as galactic longitude approached @xmath149 , so we also selected a higher latitude region as a reference ( green dashed line in figure 16 ) .",
    "figure 17 shows the magnitude distribution as a function of galactic longitude for the reference region , the high latitude portion of the acs , and the acs with the reference region subtracted .",
    "figure 18 shows histograms with a gaussian fit to the peak apparent magnitude for galactic longitudes between @xmath150 and @xmath151 , with the reference region ( containing sagittarius debris ) subtracted .",
    "the peak apparent magnitudes for the regions centered at @xmath152 and @xmath153 , are 19.46 , 19.38 , 19.42 , 19.31 , 19.38 , 19.32 , 19.38 , and 19.72 , respectively .",
    "note that the acs stays at nearly a constant distance from the sun .",
    "the last histogram , with stars in the range @xmath154 , is substantially shifted and broadened , and we suspect it is contaminated with sagittarius dwarf tidal debris , so we do not use this distance when comparing with the acs orbit .",
    "figure 19 shows a comparison of our measurements of position , distance , and line - of - sight velocity with the orbit fit by @xcite .",
    "the distances were determined by assuming that the average turnoff star has an absolute magnitude @xmath43 .",
    "our data is a very good fit , and supports the idea that the acs is a co - rotating tidal debris stream .",
    "we also checked whether the sdss proper motions were consistent with the @xcite orbit fit .",
    "the mean predicted proper motion of the orbit between @xmath155 is @xmath156 mas yr@xmath3 . for comparison , we extracted proper motions from sdss dr7 for all stars between @xmath155 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 .",
    "histograms of these proper motions are seen in figure 20 .",
    "the median proper motion from sdss data is denoted by a solid vertical line , with the expected motion in a non - rotating halo given as a dashed line , disk - like rotation of 220 km s@xmath3 given as a dotted line , and the predictions of the @xcite orbit as dot - dashed lines .",
    "we note that the @xmath160 proper motions for acs turnoff candidates from sdss are between the predictions for the halo and thin - disk populations .",
    "note also the apparent double peak in this dimension of the proper motions .",
    "we expect about half of the stars in the sample to be halo stars and half to be members of the acs .",
    "for example , note in the top two panels of figure 11 that in the @xmath161 region , about half of the stars have the velocity and metallicities of halo stars and half have the velocity and metallicity of the acs ; very few appear to be disk stars . in figure 21",
    "we show the measured direction of the acs , as determined from sdss proper motions .",
    "the proper motion is just along the overdensity of stars , as we would expect .",
    "since half of the stars in the sample are halo stars ( stationary on average ) , the magnitude of the tangential velocity is artificially small but the direction is unchanged .",
    "we now re - visit a previous , confusing measurement of the acs proper motion .",
    "@xcite measured the space velocity of stars near @xmath29 that had colors and magnitudes consistent with membership in the acs .",
    "their result showed that the selected stars appear to move in a direction inclined by about 30 degrees to the visible stream , roughly along galactic latitude .",
    "the authors suggested that because the field of view where their data were taken is on the periphery of the visible stream , they may be seeing the peculiar motion of a sub - component about the center of mass of the progenitor system .",
    "here we note that the acs has a sharp density cutoff at its high - latitude edge ; the field in the carlin et al .",
    "study appears to lie in a region of lower density slightly beyond this cutoff ( see figure 16 ) .",
    "thus , since we see the lower - latitude structure extending up to almost b@xmath162 degrees , it may be that the carlin et al .",
    "study sampled part of the lower - latitude substructure ( at its extension to higher latitudes ) rather than the higher - latitude , inclined , stream - like structure .",
    "this assertion is bolstered by the fact that the 3-d motion measured by @xcite of stars selected from a clear stellar overdensity in the color - magnitude diagram is nearly parallel to the milky way disk .    to assess the possible contribution of monoceros ring - like stars to the carlin et al .",
    "result , we selected only the stars among their 31 reported stream candidates consistent with our findings for the substructure(s ) in this region .",
    "namely , we selected only stars bluer than @xmath163 , fainter than @xmath164 ( i.e. , right on the narrow main sequence turnoff locus of the anti - center structure ) , and with metallicity between @xmath165 [ fe / h ] @xmath116 . from the remaining 15 stars , we find weighted mean proper motions of @xmath166 mas / yr [ compare to the original result of @xmath167mas / yr . when converted to proper motions along galactic coordinates ( i.e. , @xmath168 and @xmath169 ) in a galactocentric frame ( i.e. , removing the contribution of the sun s 220 km s@xmath3circular velocity ) , these become @xmath170 mas yr@xmath3 [ compared to @xmath171 mas yr@xmath3 in @xcite ]",
    "this exercise brings the measured proper motions to an orientation inclined by @xmath172 degrees ( or @xmath173 sigma ) to the visible stream ( figure  21 ) , though also still consistent with disk - like rotation at just above the 1-sigma level .",
    "we note that the lower substructure in our study has been found to have essentially disk - like motion among blue turnoff stars , so that the @xcite study may have been sampling stars from the lower substructure identified here , rather than the higher feature .",
    "the 15 stars in our selection from the carlin et al .",
    "data yield a weighted mean line - of - sight velocity of v@xmath174 km s@xmath3 , and mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath175 .",
    "along our line of sight at @xmath176 ( see center panel of figure 4 ) , the number of blue stars in the thick disk is steadily decreasing with distance until suddenly a group of stars with a different metallicity , different color turnoff , similar mean velocity , narrower velocity dispersion , and narrow distance range appear at of @xmath177 kpc above the disk and 20 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "the anti - center substructure appears to include ( at least ) three components with different properties : a low latitude , higher density substructure ( the monoceros ring ) ; a prominent higher latitude substructure that is tilted with respect to the disk ( the acs ) ; and a smaller substructure ( ebs ) that is near @xmath178 .",
    "the measured properties of thick disk stars 6 kpc from the sun towards the galactic anti - center , in this same sdss dr8 dataset are : rotation speed consistent with 170 km s@xmath3 ( this was assumed based on the compilation of @xcite , not fit , but is a good match to the data ) , velocity dispersion of @xmath179 km s@xmath3 , metallicity approximately -0.6 , including stars with metallicity @xmath180[fe / h]@xmath181 .",
    "the primary higher latitude component ( acs ) does not have constant galactic latitude as a function of galactic longitude .",
    "it extends above @xmath182 at @xmath183 , and is below @xmath184 at @xmath185 .",
    "the high latitude edge appears quite sharp , and the density appears to decrease towards lower galactic longitudes . it does not disappear , however , since we still find stars that are kinematically associated with this structure in spectroscopic regions m7 , and probably also m3 , which are almost @xmath186 below the top edge of the structure .",
    "this component has a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath118 , a very narrow velocity dispersion ( @xmath187 km s@xmath3 ) , and a line - of - sight velocity that is higher than expected for the thick disk .",
    "in particular , the line - of - sight @xmath86 is positive at @xmath14 . in all axially symmetric potential models for the milky way",
    ", disk structures will have a line - of - sight velocity in this direction of zero , since on average the stars are on circular orbits and at @xmath14 we are looking at that circle in the radial direction .",
    "we show that the line - of - sight velocities , distances , and proper motions of acs stars are consistent with the orbit fit of @xcite .",
    "the lower latitude component has a much higher density of stars , is present at @xmath53 at all longitudes probed in this survey , has a metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath92 , has a velocity dispersion of @xmath188 km s@xmath3 ( as calculated from regions m14 , l3 , and l4 ) , has a mean line - of - sight velocity that is consistent with the 170 km s@xmath3 rotation speed of the thick disk , and spans a galactic longitude range of at least @xmath189 .    from the data presented in figure 14 , we compute the distance to the monoceros ring along four low - latitude lines of sight .",
    "we selected four low latitude regions , outlined by blue lines in figure 15 , and histogrammed the apparent magnitudes of the blue ( @xmath52 ) stars in each line of sight . from the histograms in figure 14 , we measured the peak apparent magnitude , which is tabulated in table 4 .",
    "we assume that the mean absolute magnitude of f turnoff stars in low metallicity populations is @xmath43 @xcite , and calculate the distance to the monoceros ring in each direction . from figure 16",
    "we estimate the mean galactic coordinates in the selected low latitude regions , and then convert to galactic ( x , y , z ) , assuming the sun is 8 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "we use the right - handed convention that ( x , y , z ) are zero at the galactic center , x increases in the direction from the sun to the galactic center , y increases in the direction of galactic rotation , and z is positive in the north galactic cap .",
    "the monoceros ring stays at an approximately constant cylindrical distance from the galactic center , consistent with the finding that the mean velocity is the same as a ( circularly symmetric ) thick disk . because the monoceros feature is not clearly distinct in velocity and does not have a well - defined position , we choose not to try to fit an orbit to it ",
    "more information on both the kinematics and the position of the highest density portion of monoceros will be needed to derive an orbit for this structure .",
    "because the monoceros ring is circularly symmetric and co - rotating with the disk , it has been difficult to separate it from the disk populations . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that we could separate it from the thick disk because it had a much lower velocity dispersion and a larger scale height .",
    "larger scale heights , we thought , would require larger velocity dispersions . however , it was later pointed out to us that it was possible to have a larger scale height and lower velocity dispersion if the surface density in the galactic plane decreased at 20 kpc from the galactic center .    in this paper , our argument that the monoceros ring is different from the thick disk depends on two lines of reasoning .",
    "the first point is that the monoceros ring stars at 20 kpc from the galactic center are clearly drawn from a different population than the thick disk stars at about 14 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "our data shows a discontinuity in the number of stars detected along our line of sight , and the metallicity and turnoff color of those stars .",
    "the monoceros ring is lower metallicity , has a bluer turnoff , and is much more densely populated than the expected thick disk at that distance and height above the plane .",
    "if the monoceros ring is a warp or flare of the thick disk , its stellar populations change and then flare between 14 and 20 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "the disk would have to have a significant gradient in metallicity with distance from the galactic center , the velocity dispersion would have to decrease by half , and then the disk would have to flare up ( or warp ) and end abruptly .",
    "the second point is that we see evidence that there are some stars with the expected kinematics of the thick disk that are observed in the same color and apparent magnitude range ( and therefore presumed distance from the galactic center ) as the monoceros ring .",
    "the stars in regions h7 , h8 in figure 12 and table 2 have a distribution expected for the thick disk , and no observed over - density in the number counts of stars .",
    "the stellar distribution is completely consistent with being drawn from a thick disk population , as shown by a k - s test .",
    "in addition , there are indications of a low fraction of stars with thick disk kinematics in most of the other anti - center regions with spectra in the @xmath44 range .",
    "figure 14 supports the idea that the spectra in regions h7 , h8 have some higher metallicity stars , in keeping with the thick disk hypothesis , and that there is a second population of disk - like stars in high latitude regions where we see the acs .",
    "it would be difficult to explain two sets of stars from the same galactic component , in the same location , that have different velocity dispersions .",
    "many previous authors who have studied disk star counts towards the galactic anti - center have concluded that the disk cuts off at 12 - 15 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "a recent study by @xcite examines five directions with galactic longitudes near 60 , 95 , 295 , 314 , and 335 , and find that the disk cuts off around @xmath190 kpc from the galactic center in all directions .",
    "although we find a few stars that could be members of the thick disk at 20 kpc from the sun in higher regions 7 and 8 , our data are consistent with a significant drop in density around 14 kpc from the galactic center near the anti - center .",
    "if there are indeed stars with thick disk kinematics , including a larger velocity dispersion , at the same distance as we see the monoceros ring , then it becomes harder to associate the monoceros ring with the thick disk .",
    "we would also like to point out that the stellar density substructure in the panel of figure 1 with @xmath52 and @xmath44 is not at all similar to the density structure in a similar region of figure 7 from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath143-body simulation in this figure does not have a stellar density that increases towards the galactic plane .",
    "near the anti - center , the stars are spread fairly evenly in the range @xmath191 .",
    "there is no enhanced density at @xmath53 as we see in the data . although one might be able to adjust the @xcite simulation of tidal disruption in the galactic anti - center to fit the acs , the monoceros ring is not explained by this model .",
    "we see an over - density of stars in the same sky location and at about the same distance as @xcite identified the eastern banded structure ( ebs ) . in figure  15 , we showed that the peak apparent magnitude of the turnoff of this structure is @xmath192 , which corresponds to a distance of 13.67 kpc from the sun , assuming an absolute magnitude of @xmath193 .",
    "this is somewhat larger than the distance of @xmath194 kpc found by @xcite and the @xmath195 kpc found by @xcite to their detections of velocity substructures apparently within the ebs labeled  b-7/pci-8/pcii-20 \" and  b-8/pci-9/pcii-21 \" .",
    "however , as noted previously , the starcount peak in figure  15 is broad compared to what one expects from the cmd in that region .",
    "we thus need to assess whether additional ( sub-)structures are  contaminating \" our ebs distance - measurement sample .",
    "the upper panel of figure  22 shows a color - magnitude hess diagram for the @xmath196 wide region centered on the ebs seen as a red box in figure  16 , spanning @xmath197 between @xmath198 . in this figure",
    "it is clear that there is a turnoff at @xmath199 , which corresponds to a distance of @xmath200 kpc from the sun , assuming an absolute magnitude of @xmath193 .",
    "a comparison region of the same size but at @xmath201 higher galactic latitude was also selected . the hess diagram of this region , seen in the lower panel of figure  22 , does not show the clear main sequence seen in the ebs region , but it does show a feature at fainter ( @xmath202 ) magnitudes . upon close examination , this ",
    "extra \" feature is apparent in both panels of figure  22 with the highest density at @xmath203 , corresponding to a distance of @xmath204 kpc ( again assuming @xmath193 ) .",
    "this additional peak is likely responsible for broadening the ebs peak in figure  15 .",
    "we explore this in figure  23 , which shows histograms of @xmath64 magnitudes of f turnoff stars having @xmath205 for the same @xmath196 regions used to generate the  ebs \" and  background \" cmds in figure  22 .",
    "the ebs region shows two apparent peaks at @xmath206 and @xmath207 on top of the milky way halo distribution .",
    "the background region , displaced @xmath201 to higher latitude , shows the  extra \" peak at @xmath207 , but does not have the peak at brighter magnitudes that we believe is due to the ebs .",
    "this becomes clear when we subtract the off - stream field from the ebs region s histogram ( bottom panel in figure  23 )  the residuals are a rather narrow feature that we find to be well fit with a gaussian at @xmath208 .",
    "this corresponds to a distance to the ebs of @xmath209 kpc , assuming @xmath210 .",
    "the mean line - of - sight velocities of ebs stars are nearly identical to expectations for the thick disk at that distance , but the velocity dispersion is somewhat narrower .",
    "there are few enough stars that a k  s test does not rule out the possibility that these stars are selected from a thick disk population , though the best fit is lower dispersion and there is clearly an over - density here in the photometry . from figure  14",
    ", we see that the metallicity of the ebs is about [ fe / h]@xmath211 , and clearly lower than the acs .",
    "in this paper we study the anti - center substructure , originally discovered by @xcite at about 20 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "we confirm that this substructure is composed of at least three substructures : the monoceros ring , the anti - center stream , and the eastern banded structure @xcite .",
    "we also suggest that there might be a small number of normal thick disk stars at the same galactocentric radius towards the anti - center , thus bolstering the case that the anti - center substructures are not extensions of the thick disk at large distances from the galactic center .",
    "_ thick disk : _ the thick disk , at 6 kpc from the sun towards the anti - center , has line - of - sight velocities consistent with a 170 km s@xmath3 rotation speed , and a velocity dispersion of @xmath212 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the metallicity distribution of these stars peaks at about [ fe / h ] @xmath93 .",
    "two of the regions with spectra , h7 and h8 at @xmath213 , have @xmath214 g@xmath215 f turnoff stars with mean line - of - sight velocity and velocity dispersions that are identical to the thick disk .",
    "figure 14 ( top panel ) shows that although there are a few disk - like stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath216 , there are also disk - like stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath217 .",
    "spectra from regions at similar latitudes , apparent magnitudes , and colors , but which cover sky directions in which one of the three anti - center substructures is located , do not have a high fraction of stars with thick disk metallicities ( though there are a few ) .",
    "most of the spectroscopic regions have a few stars that are consistent with thick disk dispersion , and the line - of - sight velocity distribution is better fit assuming there are some thick disk stars in addition to the narrower substructure stars ( figure 12 ) .      _",
    "anti - center stream ( acs ) : _ this is a tilted component that extends to higher galactic latitude at lower galactic longitude towards the anti - center . it appears to have a sharp cutoff on the high latitude side .",
    "although the density of the stars appears highest at the high latitude edge , the structure appears to include stars at least down to @xmath184 , even when the high latitude edge is over @xmath182 .",
    "the line - of - sight velocities , distances , and proper motions along the high latitude edge of the substructure are consistent with the orbit fit in @xcite .",
    "the anti - center stream is likely to be an artifact of tidal disruption of a dwarf galaxy , though @xmath143-body simulations should be run to show that the observed density structure can be fit .",
    "_ monoceros ring : _ this is a higher density substructure that is present at@xmath1 at all longitudes probed in this survey .",
    "the structure likely continues towards lower latitudes .",
    "the high density of stars at lower latitudes is not consistent with the @xcite model .",
    "the distances are consistent with a constant cylindrical distance from the galactic center of 17.6 kpc , assuming the sun is 8 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "the mean line - of - sight velocity of the structure is consistent with a rotation speed of 170 km s@xmath3 , similar to the thick disk rotation speed and direction .",
    "however , the velocity dispersion of these stars is @xmath172 km s@xmath3 , and the metallicity is [ fe / h]@xmath219 . both of these quantities are lower than the canonical thick disk .",
    "we suggest that this ring structure is likely different from the thick disk , though its association with the disk can not be definitively ruled out .",
    "all indications from our data and from previous authors are that the thick disk stellar density drops off quickly farther than 14 kpc from the center .",
    "if the monoceros ring is a thick disk structure , then the data implies the thick disk changes properties dramatically after 14 kpc : the scale height increases while the dispersion decreases ; the metallicity decreases and the turnoff becomes bluer ; and the disk suddenly disappears after flaring up .",
    "if the small number of stars with a broader velocity distribution do in fact belong to the canonical thick disk population and are at the same distance as the monoceros ring , then it is more difficult to claim the monoceros ring is a part of the thick disk .",
    "_ eastern banded structure ( ebs ) : _ this structure is detected primarily photometrically , near @xmath5 , at a distance of 10.9 kpc from the sun .",
    "the small number of spectra available in this region of the sky have line - of - sight velocity similar that expected for the thick disk , but again with a narrower best fit velocity dispersion ( @xmath220 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the metallicity of the ebs is about [ fe / h]@xmath92 .",
    "in addition to these main conclusions , we serendipitously discovered a few stars that are most likely part of the sagittarius leading tidal tail .",
    "these stars at @xmath138 have v@xmath221 km s@xmath3 , [ fe / h]@xmath93 , and have apparent magnitude g@xmath222 .",
    "the sky position and velocity of these stars is consistent with the @xcite triaxial halo model .",
    "clearly , a larger and more complete spectroscopic survey of the anti - center is warranted , to further clarify the nature and origin of these substructures .",
    "we would like 3d kinematics ( proper motions and radial velocities ) as well as higher resolution chemical abundance analysis .",
    "upcoming surveys including the guoshoujing telescope ( lamost ) , bigboss , hermes , apogee , and gaia will be quite useful for these studies .",
