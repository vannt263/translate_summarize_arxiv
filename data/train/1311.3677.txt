    "stability limits of the 2d solitons and evolution of the unstable ones were investigated in the numerical form , by means of the computation of stability eigenvalues and direct simulations .",
    "although large parts of the soliton families are unstable , the instability is quite weak , making it possible to use formally unstable solitons in physical applications .",
    "head - on collisions between solitons were studied in a systematic form too , demonstrating that the collisions break the symmetry between identical solitons , but do not break the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "it may be interesting to extend the 2d analysis of the same model to vortex solitons .",
    "starting from pioneering works @xcite and @xcite , the stability of 2d vortex solitons in the single - core system with the cq nonlinearity was a subject of many studies @xcite .",
    "for the dual - core cq system , the analysis of the vortex - soliton stability was reported in ref .",
    "the @xmath1-symmetric generalization of such settings may be the next natural step .",

    "<S> we introduce one- and two - dimensional ( 1d and 2d ) models of parity - time ( @xmath0 ) -symmetric couplers with the mutually balanced linear gain and loss applied to the two cores , and cubic - quintic ( cq ) nonlinearity acting in each one . </S>",
    "<S> the 2d and 1d models may be realized in dual - core optical waveguides , in the spatiotemporal and spatial domains , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> stationary solutions for @xmath1-symmetric solitons in these systems reduce to their counterparts in the usual coupler . </S>",
    "<S> the most essential problem is the stability of the solitons , which become unstable against symmetry breaking with the increase of the energy ( norm ) , and retrieve the stability at still larger energies . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary value of the intercore - coupling constant , above which the solitons are completely stable , is found by means of an analytical approximation , based on the cw ( zero - dimensional ) counterpart of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the approximation demonstrates good agreement with numerical findings for the 1d and 2d solitons . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results for the stability limits of the 2d solitons are obtained by means of the computation of eigenvalues for small perturbations , and verified in direct simulations . </S>",
    "<S> although large parts of the solitons families are unstable , the instability is quite weak . </S>",
    "<S> collisions between 2d solitons in the @xmath1-symmetric coupler are studied by means of simulations . </S>",
    "<S> outcomes of the collisions are inelastic but not destructive , as they do not break the @xmath1 symmetry . </S>"
