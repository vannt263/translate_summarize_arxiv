    "numerical analyses of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) on a discrete space - time lattice ( lattice qcd ) , indicate that the transition from confined to deconfined matter at finite temperature @xmath0 and vanishing quark chemical potential @xmath1 is a crossover  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , model studies  @xcite predict a first - order transition to occur for @xmath1 of the order of @xmath2 of the baryon mass and @xmath3 . in between these two regimes , a second - order critical point is expected in the @xmath4 plane at some intermediate values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the existence and the exact location of the critical point is still a matter of dispute  @xcite and has been under intense theoretical study using effective field theory models of qcd  @xcite ( see also the recent analysis performed in ref .",
    "unfortunately , a direct application of lattice qcd at finite @xmath1 is , at present , still quite problematic . only relatively recently , new theoretical developments and technical improvements allowed to circumvent in various ways the fermion determinant problem and start performing monte - carlo calculations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "although most of the results obtained up to now seem to support the qcd critical point , an interesting observation against its existence comes from refs .",
    "@xcite where , from numerical simulations of qcd at imaginary chemical potential , one observes that the region of quark masses where the transition is presumably of the first order ( for quark masses smaller than the physical ones ) , tends to shrink for small positive values of the chemical potential , @xmath1 .",
    "conversely , according to models supporting the critical point , the first order region should expand when @xmath1 increases , so that the physical quark mass point hits the critical line at some finite value of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "a possible explanation for this discordance has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was pointed out that a strong ( repulsive ) vector coupling may account for the initial shrinkage of the first order region , that would then start expanding again at larger values of @xmath1 . as a result , two critical points might appear for a given range of ( small ) quark masses , as argued in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , it has been remarked  @xcite that this does not necessarily imply the existence of the qcd critical point since a too strong repulsive potential may in fact provoke the disappearance of the first order line ( and thus of the critical point ) for physical quark masses .",
    "if the vector coupling is too small , instead , the initial shrinkage of the first order region is not clearly seen .",
    "a recent estimate  @xcite of the vector coupling from flavor susceptibilities evaluated with lattice qcd seems to support the latter scenario .",
    "based on the analysis of the linear sigma model ( l@xmath5 m ) with two flavor quarks , it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the inclusion of thermal fluctuations of the mesonic fields leads to the appearance of two critical points for a small finite vacuum pion mass , @xmath6  mev , without the need for a vector interaction . for physical values of the pion mass the model predicts only one critical point as one would naively expect for qcd .",
    "also in this case , the initial shrinkage of the first order region at small @xmath1 was proved to be a not uncommon feature . however , as we will discuss , the direct transposition of these arguments to qcd should be done with special care . in the chiral limit , in fact , the phase diagram of the two flavor l@xmath5 m  is divided in two parts by a continuous first order transition , whereas in qcd universality arguments  @xcite suggest a second order phase transition of the o(4 ) universality class , at least at @xmath7 .",
    "very recently , it was found ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the correct treatment of the fermion vacuum fluctuations ( that were neglected in most l@xmath5 m  applications ) can change the order of the transition in the chiral limit from first to second order , depending on the coupling constants . in this case",
    "the phase diagram of the l@xmath5 m  would resemble the nambu  jona - lasinio model ( njl ) one with a second order line starting at @xmath7 and high-@xmath0 and terminating at a tricritical point ( at intermediate @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) where the first order line starts ending at @xmath8 .",
    "interestingly enough , these findings of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest the possibility of a rich structure for the qcd phase diagram in a situation which is similar to the one which arises in metamagnetic systems whose phase diagram may display two critical points in the magnetic field versus temperature plane  @xcite . a multicritical point structure induced by charge neutrality and",
    "vector interaction has been recently discussed by zhang and kunihiro in the context of the 2 + 1 flavor njl model  @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the presence of strong magnetic fields ( @xmath9 ) , may change the order of the phase transition as shown by fraga and mizher  @xcite who considered the two flavor l@xmath5 m  , at @xmath7 , obtaining that the usual crossover can turn into a first order phase transition in this regime .",
    "the aim of the present work is to explore in some details the phase diagram of two of the most important effective field theory models of qcd with two quark flavors represented by the l@xmath5 m   and the njl model when small finite pion ( and quark current ) masses are considered .",
    "the thermodynamics of both models has been compared , with standard parametrization in ref .",
    "@xcite where the mfa has been used .",
    "as we shall see , going beyond the mfa allows for the appearance of more than one critical point in both models for certain parameter values . for the l@xmath5 m  we will use the same approximation of refs .",
    "@xcite and will closely follow the methods therein to map the phase diagram for various values of the pion mass , @xmath10 .",
    "as it will be shown , by varying @xmath10 , two and also three critical points ( two of them are actually very close to each other ) may appear . as a further step , we will explore the nature of these critical points by analyzing the susceptibilities and the correlations of the net - quark number density , the entropy density and the scalar density .",
    "the second part of the paper will be dedicated to the njl model , in its simplest form , which will be treated in the so - called optimized perturbation theory ( opt ) .",
    "the opt method ( which also goes by different names , or has many variants , e.g. `` delta - expansion ''  @xcite , order - dependent mapping  @xcite , etc . )",
    "is well known for allowing evaluations beyond mfa due to the way it modifies ordinary perturbative expansion , giving a non trivial ( non - perturbative ) coupling dependence .",
    "examples of successful applications include the most precise analytical values of the critical temperature for non interacting bose gases  @xcite as well as the precise location of the tricritical point and the mixed liquid - gas phase within the gross - neveu model in 2 + 1 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the latter illustrates how this method can be a powerful tool beyond standard perturbation theory , since these important effects were missed by the mfa and could not be precisely determined by monte carlo simulations  @xcite . the opt version adopted here is mainly indicated to non - gauge theories , which ( at finite temperature ) require the method to be extended , e.g. by adding and subtracting a hard thermal loop improvement that modifies the propagators and vertices in a self - consistent way , in the so - called hard - thermal - loop perturbation theory ( htlpt )  @xcite . regarding its use within renormalizable theories",
    "the opt has just been substantially improved by its combination with renormalization group properties  @xcite .",
    "this method has been recently applied to the njl model in the evaluation of the thermodynamical potential beyond mfa using standard parametrization  @xcite .",
    "the same type of application will be considered here , with a different set of parameters , in order to verify the possibility of multiple critical points as found in the l@xmath5 m .",
    "our investigation , as already anticipated , shows that in the very strong coupling limit this situation ( which would be missed by the mfa ) arises .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the opt brings @xmath11 corrections to the mfa effective potential which are proportional to the scalar density , @xmath12 , as well as to the net - quark number density , @xmath13 , whose contribution to the pressure goes as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the usual njl coupling , @xmath16 is the number of colors and @xmath17 the number of flavors .",
    "this means that a type of @xmath11 suppressed vector term whose strength is twice its scalar counterpart will contribute to the pressure so that when the interaction is sufficiently strong the results seem to support the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite where the su(3 ) njl with an explicit repulsive vector interaction , such as the one suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , was used .",
    "we recall that , contrary to the l@xmath5 m , the njl is a non renormalizable theory which is often regularized by a non covariant ultra violet cut off , @xmath18 .",
    "then , from the quantitative point of view our whole njl application must be taken with care since to generate exotic phase diagrams similar to the l@xmath5 m one needs very high values for @xmath15 which in turn generate high effective quark masses at zero temperature and density .",
    "although the effective quark mass value generated by those parameters becomes larger than @xmath18 , the values of relevant observables , such as the quark condensate and the pion decay constant , remain well within reasonable values . also , as already emphasized , one of the goals of the present njl application is to check whether this model , like the l@xmath5 m , supports the existence of more than one critical point in its phase diagram .",
    "after obtaining the opt effective potential ( or free energy density ) we derive the pressure and many thermodynamical quantities of interest including susceptibilities and critical exponents .",
    "the results obtained with both models indicate that the first order line observed at low chemical potential and high temperature has a more `` chiral '' character while its low temperature and high chemical potential counterpart displays characteristics typical of a `` liquid - gas '' phase transition .",
    "finally , it will be shown that with both models our results seem to support the back - bending of the critical line in the @xmath19 plane ( where @xmath20 is the quark current mass ) which , as first discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , could reconcile the actual lattice findings with most models predictions .",
    "it is also shown that the mfa completely misses the possibility of more than one critical point in the @xmath4 plane , for both models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "the l@xmath5 m is reviewed with the inclusion of thermal fluctuations .",
    "after obtaining the phase diagram in the @xmath4 plane for small pion masses the characteristics of each different critical point is examined by a careful analysis of the densities and susceptibilities . in sec .",
    "iii the recent opt application @xcite to the njl model is quickly reviewed .",
    "we then obtain a set of parameter values which leads to the emergence of a second critical point , analogous to the one found in the l@xmath5 m .",
    "we perform a comprehensive thermodynamical analysis to investigate how multiple critical points appear in the @xmath4 plane as well as in phase coexistence diagrams in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 planes .",
    "we also numerically investigate the behavior of quantities such as the interaction measure , the equation of state parameter , bulk viscosity , and susceptibilities at , and around , each critical end point .",
    "the latter quantities allow us to estimate some relevant critical exponents in order to distinguish the physical nature of both critical points which is also done by considering the free energy in terms of two ordering densities , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "finally , in sec iv we present our main conclusions .",

    "although the peaks associated with @xmath117 look more pronounced one has to recall that @xmath72 is normalized by @xmath312 and that the @xmath117 region is associated with lower temperatures .",
    "next , let us investigate the eos parameter , @xmath313 , as represented by fig .",

    "the bulk viscosity , @xmath315 , is an intrinsic dynamical quantity which , however , can be expressed in terms of the static thermodynamical quantities derived from the free energy as  @xcite    @xmath316\\ ; , \\label{bulk}\\ ] ]    where @xmath317 is a scale which will be set to @xmath18 , as in ref.@xcite , while @xmath318 represents the vacuum part of the energy density .",
    "since @xmath315 is proportional to the specific heat , @xmath319 , the bulk viscosity over entropy density , @xmath307 , behaves as @xmath320 near @xmath321 in this approximation and peaks at the critical end points as indeed shown by our fig .",
    "[ zetas ] where the divergences at ( @xmath322 ) and at ( @xmath323 ) indicate that the energy density has a sudden change at the critical points typical of a first order transition . for our purposes this is an interesting quantity since it has been pointed out that one can distinguish whether the system experiences a first order phase transition or a crossover from observables which are sensitive to the bulk viscosity in rhic type of experiments .",
    "on expects that a sharp rise of bulk viscosity near a phase transition induces an instability in the hydrodynamic flow of the plasma , and this mode will blow up tearing the system into droplets @xcite .",

    "as expected , one observes that these two quantities peak for both @xmath152 and @xmath117 .",
    "however , for @xmath308 , the magnitude of the peak associated with @xmath117 seems to be much larger while for @xmath309 the difference is not so dramatic . in principle",

    "starting at the point @xmath365 one may follow a second order transition line which goes left touching the @xmath1 axis at @xmath366 and then going up to @xmath367 where it bends back to the right hand side for finite values of @xmath20 .",
    "the situation is illustrated by the bottom panel of figure [ mcmu ] .",
    "therefore , when one goes beyond mfa , the njl also predicts a bending back behavior of the critical line in a way which is consistent with the negative curvature of the lattice simulations of refs .",
    "this result also supports fukushima s suggestion  @xcite regarding the eventual back bending .",
    "although this author has considered the su(3 ) version of the njl ( being able to reproduce a critical surface in the @xmath368 space ) with standard parametrization it is interesting to note that the bending was obtained by adding a vector interaction which generated a @xmath369 contribution to the pressure . by looking at our eq .",
    "( [ omegarhos ] ) one sees that the opt also brings a term like @xmath230 to @xmath370 .",
    "finally , note that a back bending behavior is also implied by our l@xmath5 m  results if one considers that @xmath117 and @xmath371 almost coincide .",
    "in recent publications  @xcite it was shown that for small values of the vacuum pion mass ( @xmath372  mev ) the phase diagram of the l@xmath5 m has two distinct first order lines terminating in two critical points .",
    "one , as predicted by most models , starts at finite @xmath1 and @xmath8 , whereas the other is an unusual first order line which starts at high @xmath0 and @xmath7 . in between the critical endpoints ( whose exact location depends on the vacuum pion mass ) of these two lines",
    "there is a crossover transition . at the origin of this behavior ,",
    "that is not observed in mfa , are the thermal fluctuations of the mesonic fields , that have been taken into account adopting a self consistent method first proposed in  @xcite . inspired by this finding",
    "we have performed a careful analysis of the l@xmath5 m  with the aim of understanding in deeper details the nature of the critical points . at the same time , we have considered another popular effective quark model , the njl model , to investigate under which conditions a phase diagram with at least two distinct critical points could be reproduced .    the analysis of the l@xmath5 m  has been performed by using the same method of ref .",
    "@xcite and our results agree with the ones obtained therein : the unusual first order line which starts at high @xmath0 and @xmath7 ending in the `` new '' critical point ( @xmath152 ) was also found . at the same time , a closer look in the vicinity of the `` usual '' critical endpoint revealed that , right before to end , the first order line that starts at finite @xmath1 and @xmath8 bifurcates in _ two _ critical endpoints ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) separated by few mev in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to the phase diagram we have studied susceptibilities and correlations of the net - quark number density , the entropy density , and the scalar density . our results for the covariant matrix show that for @xmath152 the dominant fluctuations are given by the scalar density and the entropy density , whereas the quark number density plays only a minor role .",
    "for the two critical points @xmath117 and @xmath118 , instead , also the fluctuations of the quark number density are important .",
    "their contribution becomes larger and larger as the vacuum pion mass is increased , probably also due to the fact that @xmath117 and @xmath118 move towards higher values of @xmath1 . despite their vicinity in the phase diagram ,",
    "@xmath117 and @xmath118 seem to exhibit distinct features . the main difference being the fluctuations of the scalar density , that are more important in @xmath118 than in @xmath117 .",
    "we have then considered the njl thermodynamical potential , recently evaluated with the opt  @xcite , with parameter values which simulate small pion masses in order to generate a @xmath4 phase diagram where the existence of two critical points , @xmath152 and @xmath117 , separated by a cross over region has been observed .",
    "this type of phase diagram is similar to the one found , in the temperature - magnetic field plane , for the compressible metamagnetic ising model @xcite    we have performed an extensive thermodynamical analysis in order to find the essential physical features that distinguish both critical points concluding , in agreement with the l@xmath5 m  case , that the usual one ( @xmath117 ) , located at intermediate values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 has a more hydrodynamical character with the quark number density playing an essential role .",
    "this density has little influence at lower values of @xmath1 where the new , unusual , critical point @xmath152 region is dominated by the scalar density .",
    "although we have not considered a vector term in the version of the njl model considered here it is rather interesting to note that the opt pressure has the term @xmath14 which by being @xmath11 suppressed does not contribute to the mfa which completely misses out the possible existence of @xmath152 and the associated first order line .    from these results it is clear that the inclusion of contributions beyond mfa can have dramatic consequences on the phase diagram of quark models and can not be neglected . with the combined analysis of the l@xmath5 m  and the njl model",
    ", we have shown that the appearance of multiple critical points is not an uncommon feature of effective quark models , even without explicitly introducing a vector interaction as was done in  @xcite . before exporting these notions to qcd , however , some caution is advisable .",
    "as has been very recently shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the analysis of the l@xmath5 m  in mfa , the inclusion of vacuum fluctuations can change the transition in the chiral limit at @xmath7 from first to second order so that this model would behave as the njl model in the same regime . however , our results for the latter suggest that the consideration of vacuum contributions should not influence the appearance of the critical point @xmath152 , at least qualitatively , when an appropriate tuning of model parameters is carried out beyond the mfa . in the minimal version of the njl model considered here",
    "@xmath152 appears only if the coupling is larger than usual ( see discussion in sec .",
    "[ nonstandard ] ) while a sharp cut off is introduced only in the divergent integrals .",
    "however , having a large parameter space , more sophisticated versions of the model could also allow for the appearance of a critical point point like @xmath152 generating , at the same time , more plausible values for the vacuum effective quark mass . concerning the other two critical points found in the l@xmath5 m  ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) , instead",
    ", vacuum fermion loops are not expected to modify dramatically the qualitative behavior of the model , especially for values of the vacuum pion mass close to the physical one  @xcite .",
    "the presence of @xmath118 in the l@xmath5 m  with thermal fluctuations , however , has not been confirmed by the opt analysis of the njl model .",
    "this might be due to various reasons including the fact that the two models have been evaluated under different approximations , the fact that the njl does not have true mesonic degrees of freedom , etc .",
    "the clarification of these points calls for further investigations .",
    "nevertheless , our results allow us to conclude that it is possible to use these effective models to generate metamagnetic like phase diagrams at the expense of using non standard parameters for @xmath20 and @xmath255 which weakly break chiral symmetry in approximations which go beyond the mfa . having two critical points",
    ", it then becomes possible to observe the shrinkage of first order region , in the @xmath373 plane , as one considers higher values of @xmath1 so that model predictions could be conciliated with the lattice results by de forcrand and philipsen @xcite .",
    "then , as we have shown , the first order region should increase again eventually intercepting the physical mass point as argued in ref.@xcite .",
    "the `` chiral '' like first order transition observed in the line associated with @xmath152 seems to be much softer and the coexistence regions much smaller than in the traditional `` liquid - gas '' type of line associated with the @xmath117 which perhaps would make it harder to be detected in lattice qcd calculations ( see for example ref .",
    "although quantities such as the trace anomaly , eos parameter , bulk viscosity and susceptibilities display the expected behavior associated with first order phase transitions it seems that the different critical points belong to distinct universality classes .",
