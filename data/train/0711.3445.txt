    "the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk)@xcite model of spin glasses has been the subject of hundreds of papers .",
    "it is the model for which mean - field theory becomes exact in the thermodynamic limit ( i.e. when @xmath0 , the number of spins in the model , becomes infinite ) .",
    "parisi s replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) solution@xcite is now known to be the correct mean - field solution@xcite .",
    "extensive studies , mostly numerical , have been made of the model at finite @xmath0 values .",
    "analytically the determination of the properties of the model at finite @xmath0  the finite - size corrections  is a much more challenging task in the low - temperature phase than finding the mean - field theory . at finite @xmath0",
    "all the loop corrections to the mean - field solution need to be considered . because of the massless modes present in the low - temperature phase@xcite each term in the loop expansion is infinite .",
    "hence a direct perturbative approach is impossible .",
    "a similar situation applies in finite dimensional spin glasses , already for the bulk term , when the dimension @xmath9 is smaller than six@xcite , so that one could hope at least that experience gained in studying finite size effects in the sk model might be relevant to spin glasses in physical dimensions .",
    "unfortunately we have been unable to find any systematic theoretical treatment of the finite - size problem .",
    "however , we have managed to obtain insights into it by examining the structure of the parisi overlap probability distribution function @xmath4 ( i.e. _ the non - averaged overlap probability distribution function _ ) at finite @xmath0 values .",
    "@xmath4 is defined as the probability that the overlap of the spins in two copies of the system with the same realization of the quenched disorder @xmath10 is equal to @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath12 where the hamiltonian of the two - copy system is @xmath13 and the sum runs over all the pairs @xmath14 of sites in the system .",

    "( [ defn ] ) is taken over the boltzmann weight associated with all the possible values ( @xmath16 ) of the ising spins @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it has been known for many years that the function @xmath4 is very different for different realizations of the bonds . in particular",
    "it contains a very variable number @xmath3 of peaks , humps or shoulders . in this paper",
    "we shall systematically study the distribution of @xmath3 and the dependence of its average on the number of spins @xmath0 .",
    "we shall give numerical and analytic arguments that the mean number of features @xmath3 increases as @xmath19 , with @xmath20 and that @xmath21 , the width of the distribution of @xmath3 , is @xmath0 independent for large @xmath0 . the next step of our approach is to argue that the parisi replica symmetry breaking scheme , which involves @xmath1 levels of symmetry breaking ( where in order to achieve a stable solution @xmath1 has to be taken infinite in the thermodynamic limit ) , is stabilized at finite @xmath0 at a value @xmath7 by self - energy contributions ( whose @xmath0 dependence is estimated in appendix [ appndep ] ) .",
    "as a consequence we can estimate @xmath1 for a given system size and because @xmath22 ( see sec .",
    "[ purestates ] ) , we can understand the size dependence of the number of peaks / features in @xmath4 .",
    "the next step towards predicting the exponents which give the leading @xmath0 dependence of the corrections to the thermodynamic limit of quantities such as the internal energy per spin @xmath23 is simply to use the rsb scheme to compute the dependence of the quantity on @xmath1 .",
    "for example @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the value of the internal energy in the infinite @xmath1 limit@xcite .",
    "our prescription for evaluating the exponents of the leading finite size corrections is to set @xmath26 ; this implies that the leading finite size correction to the thermodynamic limit of the internal energy per spin should be of order @xmath27 . since arguments of this type",
    "do not have the strength of a theorem and can only be suggestive of the possible behaviour , we have checked our arguments with extensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "we have computed many quantities at a number of different values of the temperature .",
    "our results for the internal energy are reported in sec .",
    "[ energyshift ] .",
    "that data strongly supports the value of @xmath28 predicted by our approach for the exponent of the leading finite - size correction .",
    "similarly , the edwards - anderson order parameter @xmath29 at finite @xmath1 differs from its infinite @xmath1 form by a term of order @xmath30 .",
    "hence we predict that the finite size shift of @xmath29 should be of @xmath31 , and we present numerical evidence for this behaviour in sec .",
    "[ qea ] .    our approach can be used to investigate the sample - to - sample fluctuations of any quantity by relating them to the sample - to - sample variation in the number of features in @xmath4 , @xmath21 . for the internal energy we shall find in sec .",
    "[ ssfenergy ] numerical evidence consistent with this approach , together with a discussion of the behaviour of the sample - to - sample fluctuations in the critical regime and in the high - temperature phase .",
    "our basic prediction is that the sample - to - sample fluctuations in the total free energy of a system of @xmath0 spins are of order @xmath32 where the exponent @xmath33 .",
    "there have been numerous attempts to determine this exponent , both numerically and analytically , and we review them also in sec.[ssfenergy ] .",
    "because the peaks / features in @xmath4 are caused by the overlap of pure states , in particular those states whose free energies are of order @xmath34 from that of the lowest free energy state , one can relate the number of these pure states to the number of peaks @xmath3 using the relation @xmath22 .",
    "this connection is simplified because of the ultrametric organization of states in the sk model and the details of the argument are given in sec .",

    "our approach to the study of finite size effects in the sk model is to argue that @xmath3 , the average number of such peaks / features for a system of size @xmath0 , can be connected to a truncation of parisi s rsb scheme at its @xmath1th step , with @xmath37 .",
    "the parisi scheme at the @xmath1-th level of rsb parametrizes the bond - average of @xmath4 , @xmath38 , by a series of delta functions at various values of @xmath11 , viz @xmath39 ; @xmath40 the weights of the delta functions @xmath41 and their positions @xmath42 are the variational parameters that one optimizes to obtain the parisi solution . in the thermodynamic limit , where @xmath0 goes to infinity ,",
    "a parisi rsb solution with @xmath43 is only stable if @xmath1 is taken to infinity .",

    "schematically @xmath57 so that the self - energy @xmath58 is of order @xmath59 .",
    "now for finite values of @xmath1 in the parisi rsb scheme , the gaussian propagator is unstable and behaves as@xcite @xmath60 in the regime near the transition temperature @xmath61 where @xmath62 is small .",
    "the instability at @xmath54 only disappears when one takes the infinite @xmath1 limit .",
    "our basic idea is that for finite @xmath0 this instability can be removed by the stabilizing effect of the self - energy @xmath58 .",
    "then if @xmath63 stability will be achieved when @xmath64 in other words , when @xmath65 , there will be no need to break the symmetry further ( at least to achieve stability ) .",

    "( [ instability ] ) change the sign of @xmath75 , we would expect that the higher loop corrections to the free energy will also change the sign of this correction , but not its @xmath0 dependence .",
    "a similar argument can be given for other quantities .",
    "the additional terms in the internal energy per spin below @xmath61 at order @xmath1 in the rsb procedure are@xcite @xmath76 substituting as before @xmath72 for @xmath1 , the finite size corrections to the internal energy would be expected to be of order @xmath77 .",
    "the edwards - anderson order parameter@xcite is to order @xmath1 @xmath78 correct to order @xmath79 .",
    "it is thus to be expected on substituting for @xmath1 that the finite size corrections to @xmath29 are of order @xmath59 .",
