    "<S> we report angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) on two families of high temperature superconductors ( ca@xmath0la@xmath1)(ba@xmath2 la @xmath3)cu@xmath4o@xmath5 with @xmath6 ( @xmath7  k ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9  k ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi surface ( fs ) is found to be independent of @xmath10 or @xmath11 , and its size indicates extreme sample - surface overdoping . </S>",
    "<S> this universal fs allowes the comparison of dynamical properties between superconductors of similar structure and identical doping , but different @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the high - energy ( @xmath13  mev ) nodal velocity in the @xmath8 family is higher than in the @xmath6 family . </S>",
    "<S> the implied correlation between @xmath14 and the hopping rate @xmath15 supports the notion of kinetic energy driven superconductivity in the cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the antinodal gap is higher for the @xmath8 family .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent synthesis of charge compensated ( ca@xmath0la@xmath1)(ba@xmath2la@xmath16)cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( clblco ) single crystals facilitates an investigation of the relationship between their dynamical properties , such as the electronic dispersion relation @xmath17 and their thermodynamic property @xmath18 , while applying subtle crystal structure changes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the valence of ca and ba is equal , @xmath10 has a minute effect on crystal structure but a large effect on @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , clblco allows experiments where the correlations between @xmath18 and a single parameter are explored . </S>",
    "<S> experiments of such nature can reveal the mechanism for cuprates superconductivity . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> , we measure the electron dispersion @xmath17 of two extreme samples of clblco crystals , using angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , and look for correlations between properties of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in particular , we focus on the nodal velocity . previously , similar studies could only be done by comparing cuprates with very different structures and levels of disorder @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> clblco is similar to ybco in crystal structure , but has no oxygen chain ordering and is tetragonal for all @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this simplifies the arpes interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath10 alters the calcium - to - barium ratio , the lanthanum content in the chemical formula remains constant . </S>",
    "<S> we define four clblco `` families '' as samples with different @xmath10 , namely , @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath11 signifies the oxygen level , which drives the system between different phases . by varying @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the chemical formula </S>",
    "<S> , one can generate phase diagrams that are similar in shape yet differ in the maximum of @xmath18 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , and in the critical oxygen level at which the nature of the phase diagram changes . the phase diagram is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that the only structural properties that vary with @xmath10 or @xmath11 are the cu - o - cu buckling angle , bond length , and cuo@xmath22 plane doping efficiency @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the crystallographic parameters were measured with powder neutron diffraction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the buckling angle decreases by @xmath24 degrees as @xmath10 increases between families . </S>",
    "<S> the bond length varies from @xmath25    for @xmath8 to @xmath26  at @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the doping efficiency is determined by in - plane @xmath27o nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) amitprb10 . </S>",
    "<S> the variation in the number of holes on an oxygen @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is defined as the doping at which @xmath21 starts to drop [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) ] @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the super - exchange parameter @xmath31  for each clblco family was previously determined with muon spin rotation ( @xmath32sr ) ( magnetization ) versus temperature measurements @xcite and with two magnon raman scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1](b ) depicts the super - exchange @xmath31 and glass temperature @xmath20 ( both from @xmath32sr ) , and @xmath18 , all normalized by @xmath14 , as a function of @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> a universal phase diagram appears , demonstrating that @xmath14 scales like @xmath31 @xcite , which implies that @xmath14 is determined by the overlap of the orbital occupied by electrons on neighboring sites . </S>",
    "<S> orbital overlaps also determine the hopping parameter @xmath34 , and the scaling of @xmath14 with @xmath31 meaning that kinetic energy controls the superconducting phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath31 is determined in the afm phase , which is far , in terms of doping , from the superconducting phase . </S>",
    "<S> a question arises : are the orbital overlaps important in the superconducting phase as well ? in this phase @xmath34 can be measured . here </S>",
    "<S> , we extract @xmath34 from @xmath35 as the velocity in the nodal direction . </S>",
    "<S> we find correlations between @xmath12 and @xmath34 , and confirm the famous relation @xmath36  eskes - tj . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the band structure is rigid as a function of doping , as suggested by recent resonance inelastic x - ray scattering experiments @xcite . by the same token </S>",
    "<S> , we also measure the antinodal gaps and compare them with hamiltonian parameters .        </S>",
    "<S> the arpes experiments were performed on the sis beam - line at the swiss light source on clblco single crystals . </S>",

    "<S> for this experiment , samples with @xmath6 and @xmath8 were used . </S>",
    "<S> the samples were mounted on a copper holder with silver glue to improve electrical conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi level and resolution were determined from the polycrystalline copper sample holder . </S>",
    "<S> the samples were cleaved _ in situ _ using a glued - on pin at @xmath37  k. circularly polarized light with @xmath38  ev was used . </S>",

    "<S> the samples surface life - time was only a few hours and a high intensity beam was required for quick measurements . as a consequence , the energy resolution in our experimental conditions was limited to @xmath40 mev .    in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> cuts numbered 1 and 2 are along @xmath44 ( @xmath45 direction ) . </S>",
    "<S> these cuts allow better sensitivity to the gap size at the antinode . cut number 3 is along the diagonal line of the bz ( @xmath46 ) . in this configuration , </S>",
    "<S> a measurement of velocity in the nodal direction is possible . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1](c ) and [ fig1](f ) , spectra near the anti - node are plotted . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath6 shows high intensity spectra up to @xmath47 where no gap is visible , the @xmath8 sample shows a depletion of intensity close to @xmath48 , indicating a gap in the spectra at the antinode . for the @xmath6 , the gap , </S>",
    "<S> if one exists , is smaller than the experimental resolution . in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](d ) and [ fig1](g ) , we plot the intensity closer to the node . for both the @xmath6 and @xmath43 sample </S>",
    "<S> , we clearly see the spectra crossing @xmath47 indicating a closed gap in the nodal region . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in figs .  [ fig1](e ) and [ fig1](h ) , both nodal cuts are seen , and again , the spectra cross @xmath47 , indicating an absence of a gap along the fermi arc for both samples . </S>",

    "<S> -space at @xmath47 ( fs ) in clblco @xmath6 and @xmath8 sample , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the data were obtained at t=16 k for the @xmath6 sample and at t=11 k for the @xmath8 sample . </S>",
    "<S> both samples were prepared with optimal doping and verified with a squid magnetometer . </S>",
    "<S> the red curve is the fs of clblco obtained from tight binding fits to experimental data ( see text ) . </S>",

    "<S> fig1(d ) ) and @xmath8 ( red , fig .  [ fig1](g ) ) samples.,height=302 ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , we show the fs in the first brillouin zone ( bz ) , for the two clblco samples : @xmath6 ( fig .  [ fig2](a ) ) and @xmath43 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fs was obtained by integrating 10 mev around the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> the arpes intensity is displayed in a false color scale as a function of @xmath50 and @xmath51 . by comparing the shape of the fs </S>",
    "<S> , we can see that the @xmath8 sample exhibits a fermi arc structure  kanigel - arcs , which is typical for an antinodal gap . as for the @xmath6 sample , </S>",
    "<S> the arc is not present , and we observed strong intensity at the antinode , comparable to the intensity near the nodal region . unlike previously reported fs measurements of ybco @xcite , there is no apparent chain - like structure in the clblco fs , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> the red line is a fit to a tight binding ( tb ) model up to three nearest neighbours hopping . </S>",
    "<S> the fit parameters will be discussed below . </S>",
    "<S> the fit for both fss gives the same size , as can be seen in fig.[fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the fs of a variety of samples was measured and found to be identical regardless of family ( @xmath10 ) or bulk oxygen level ( @xmath11 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a clearer comparison of the fs size and doping between families can be obtained by examining the node - to - node and antinodal distances . in fig  fig2(c ) , we show momentum distribution curves ( mdc ) at zero binding energy ( @xmath47 ) measured in a nodal cut ( `` cut 3 '' ) , for both samples . </S>",
    "<S> the mdc for @xmath8 is sharper than for @xmath6 , but the peak - to - peak distance is equal for both mdcs . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , figure  [ fig2](d ) depicts an mdc measured in the antinode ( `` cut 2 '' ) at @xmath47 . here </S>",
    "<S> , the mdc of @xmath6 is clearer than that of @xmath8 because of an open gap , but again the peak separation for both samples is identical .    </S>",
    "<S> we suspect that the bulk doping independence of the fs is due to the sample being cleaved on a charged plane , inducing surface charge reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior was previously reported from measurements of ybco @xcite . from the measured nodal peak - to - peak distance as a function of doping in ybco described in  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we can estimate the doping of our sample , which turns out to be @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with calculations based on the fs volume . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can conclude that the surface doping level of both samples is equal within the experimental error , and that the surface doping is on the edge of the superconducting dome on the overdoped side .     </S>",
    "<S> sample at @xmath53 as a function of the fermi surface angle @xmath54 , from the node ( top ) to the anti - node ( bottom ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cuts are measured along the @xmath55 direction . </S>",
    "<S> each curve is offset for clarity . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the same as ( a ) but for the @xmath6 sample.,height=302 ]    to investigate the momentum dependence of the gap , we measured the dispersion along @xmath45 cuts between cut 1  and cut 2  for the @xmath56 and @xmath8 samples at a cold finger temperature of @xmath41 k and @xmath57 k , respectively . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , we plot symmetrized edc s at @xmath58 as a function of fs angle @xmath59 ( defined in the inset of fig  fig1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the @xmath8 sample ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) ) , one can see a zero - energy intensity peak close to the node ( @xmath60 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , at an angle of @xmath61 and lower , we observe an opening of a gap , which grows up to @xmath62 mev at the antinode ( @xmath63 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the angular dependence of the gap is shown in fig.1 of the supplementary material . </S>",
    "<S> the gap value at the antinode is similar to optimally doped bi2212  gap - doping - bssco , mesot - bi2212gap and ybco  @xcite .    for the @xmath6 sample [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) ] , the situation is different . </S>",
    "<S> close to the node , we observe a strong peak at zero energy ( @xmath64 ) . as we move to the antinode </S>",
    "<S> , the intensity at zero energy is partly suppressed , but unlike the @xmath8 sample , there is no full depletion of spectral density at @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that a gap is not present in the @xmath6 sample , or that it is smaller than the experimental resolution ( @xmath66 mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> a closed gap was measured with the same resolution for two more @xmath6 samples . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can safely say that @xmath67 .    </S>",
    "<S> last but not least , we compare the nodal velocity between families . </S>",
    "<S> this study was performed on six @xmath6 and seven @xmath8 crystals . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion in the nodal direction , previously described in fig  [ fig1](e , h ) , was measured for each sample in two branches with high statistics . </S>",
    "<S> after an orientation procedure , which is described in the supplementary material , the peak positions in the mdc of each measured dispersion was extracted and plotted as a function of binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> exemplary dispersions of two samples are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ velocite ] . </S>",
    "<S> an axis breaker is used in order to show the two branches . </S>",
    "<S> the breaker emphasizes the differences between @xmath58 of the two samples , which in fact is very small . </S>",
    "<S> two different linear regimes are observed . </S>",
    "<S> the first regime involves low energies close to @xmath47 , between @xmath68 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the second regime corresponds to high energies where @xmath69 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between these regimes is known as the kink and involves the electrons dispersion re - normalized due to correlations  @xcite or coupling between electrons and low energy bosonic degrees of freedom lanzaranature01 . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the dispersion @xmath70 provides the velocity in the low ( @xmath71 ) and high - energy ( @xmath72 ) regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the results are similar to other overdoped materials zhounature03 .    </S>",
    "<S> we did not find differences with statistical significance in @xmath71 between samples with different @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with previous work zhounature03 . as for @xmath72 , </S>",
    "<S> the results are summarized in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ velocite ] as histograms . for the @xmath6 family , </S>",
    "<S> the average high - energy velocity is @xmath73 ev@xmath74 , while for the @xmath8 it is @xmath75 ev@xmath74 . despite the velocity distribution overlap , </S>",
    "<S> the average velocities differ by 3.5@xmath76 , and hence are statistically different with 99.5% confidence . using these velocities we can now calculate all the tb coefficients by @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> the unit cell parameter @xmath78    is nearly family independent  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient are presented in the supplementary material and are in agreement with previously published values @xcite@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> , as a function of @xmath79 for @xmath6 ( black squares ) and @xmath8 ( red circles ) . </S>",

    "<S> inset : a histogram of high energy velocities obtained from a series of clblco samples with @xmath6 ( black , filled ) and @xmath8 ( red , crossed ) . </S>",
    "<S> , height=264 ]    from the data presented , we can draw several conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> first , we discuss the ratio of velocities @xmath81 . despite the large error - bar , </S>",
    "<S> this ratio is very close to that expected from the ratio of the super - exchange @xmath31 between families . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio is given by @xmath82 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the @xmath36 relation is obeyed , and @xmath12 depends on orbital overlaps even when the measurements are done in the doped phase .    </S>",
    "<S> however , arpes measurements do not necessarily represent the bulk properties . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the buckling angle might change close to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , if such a thing happens in clblco , it might affect both families equally . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the ratio of @xmath31 measured magnetically agrees with the ratio of @xmath83 measure by arpes supports this notion .    </S>",
    "<S> second , we discuss the gap . </S>",
    "<S> there are three possible scenarios that explain the difference in the gap size : i ) a scenario where disorder leads to broadening of the band structure features in @xmath6 which hide the gap . </S>",
    "<S> however , high - resolution powder x - ray diffraction @xcite and nmr experiments @xcite indicate that @xmath6 samples are more ordered than @xmath8 ones . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) a scenario where @xmath84 exist only below @xmath18 . it could be that in our experiment the surface of the @xmath8 sample is below @xmath18 , but the @xmath6 surface , is not since its @xmath18 is lower . in this case </S>",
    "<S> only the @xmath8 sample will show a gap . </S>",
    "<S> the problem with this scenario is the observation of a fermi arc in @xmath8 , which does not exist below @xmath18 in any other cuprate . </S>",
    "<S> iii ) a scenario where both samples are above @xmath18 , but there is an intrinsic difference in their gap size . the problem here is again that in other materials there is no gap above @xmath18 in extreme overdoped samples @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further experiments are needed to clarify this point .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we present the first arpes data from clblco . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the surface doping is independent of the bulk doping or the ca to ba ratio . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that the gap can be measured in this system . </S>",
    "<S> the hopping parameter @xmath34 is larger for @xmath8 than for @xmath6 in the over - doped sides . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that @xmath14 is correlated with electron - orbital overlaps on neighboring sites .    </S>",
    "<S> this research was supported by the israeli science foundation ( isf ) and the joint german - israeli dip project . </S>"
