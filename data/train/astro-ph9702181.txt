    "the sensitivity of the observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies for existing and planned experiments will allow differentiation among theoretical models determining the parameters of cosmological interest with an uncertainty of only a few per cent . however , even the most sensitive experiments have poor signal to noise ratios ( hancock 1994 ; bennett 1996 , etc . ) and are sensitive only to the most intense structures in the cmb signals . the statistical properties of the cmb signal are obtained by using sophisticated techniques ( likelihood analysis , etc . ) , which compute the correlations in the data and compare them with the expectations assuming a given model .",
    "this requires an accurate estimation of all the sources of correlated and uncorrelated noise ( wilkinson 1995 ) .",
    "lineweaver ( 1994 ) and dodelson , kosowsky & myers ( 1995 ) computed the correlated part of the noise in the cobe dmr ( smoot 1992 ) and saskatoon data ( wollack 1993 ) , respectively .",
    "this paper is mainly concerned with the tenerife beam - switching radiometers ( hancock 1994 , 1996 ; gutirrez 1995 ; davies 1996 ) .",
    "these experiments cover an angular range ( multipoles @xmath1 ) of great interest for establishing the spectral index of the primordial fluctuations and the total density of the universe and for differentiating between scalar and tensorial modes .",
    "no other experiments in this angular range are planned for the near future .",
    "improvements on the results of the tenerife experiments will require deeper integration time and an extension of the region observed in the sky , but also better estimations of the contaminating foregrounds and the assessment of the atmospheric contribution .",
    "this paper focuses on the way in which this atmospheric noise can be evaluated .",
    "section 2 is dedicated to addressing this problem for the tenerife experiments , whilst section 3 presents the formalism for the general case of experiments with @xmath2 channels at different frequencies . finally section 4 presents the conclusions .",
    "the experiments consist of three radiometers operating at 10 , 15 and 33 ghz ( two independent receivers each ) installed on tenerife at an altitude of 2400 m. for more than ten years the instruments have collected data in seven bands separated 2.5  from dec.=+30  to dec.=+45 , scanning a band at constant declination each day .",
    "detailed descriptions of the instruments , observing technique and data processing can be found in davies ( 1996 ) .",
    "the analysis presented here is dedicated to the data at dec.=+40  presented in hancock ( 1994 , 1996 ) , however the conclusions are similar to those obtained with the more recent data at dec.=+35  ( gutirrez 1997 ) .",
    "the noise in a beam - sized element ( @xmath35 ) in each of the individual observations are @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 mk at 10 , 15 and 33 ghz respectively , whilst the expected amplitudes of the cmb signal for the instrumental configuration is @xmath7 @xmath8k ; this makes it necessary to repeat the observations @xmath9 times in order to achieve enough sensitivity in the cmb signals . in the data presented by hancock ( 1994 )",
    "each position in ra correspond to a mean number of 120 , 130 and 85 observations at 10 , 15 and 33 ghz , respectively .",
    "the estimation of the error - bars in the stacking presented by hancock ( 1994 ) was done assuming that the noise in each individual observation were purely uncorrelated .",
    "this is correct for the instrumental noise , which has a thermal origin ; however , most of the observations in each instrument correspond to measurements with both channels simultaneously ( there is a small time delay of 16 ms between them ) , and therefore any possible atmospheric contribution will introduce correlation between both channels .",
    "this amplitude and temporal scale of coherence of this effect have been evaluated studying the correlation and cross - correlation functions between channels .",
    "figure 1 represents the correlation of the observations as a function of time ( which is equivalent to separation in ra ) .",
    "the plots are an extension of figure 7 in davies ( 1996 ) .",
    "the top and middle panels indicate that the sources of noise are uncorrelated on scales larger than 4 min ( the binning time ) .",
    "the cross - correlations plotted at the bottom show that a part of the noise is common to both channels ; it is likely that the atmosphere is the source of this correlated noise .",
    "the distribution of the data in each individual scan has been studied using the kolmogorov - smirnov test which shows the compatibility with a gaussian distribution . in summary , these analyses indicate that the effect of the atmosphere on the individual observations can be modelled as a gaussian noise common to simultaneous measurements of both channels with a time coherence scale smaller than 4 min , and therefore independent between adjacent positions in ra .",
    "as expected from the spectral index of atmospheric emission , the largest effect is at 33 ghz .",
    "the amplitude of this atmospheric noise can be inferred from the cross - correlation between both channels .",
    "i made monte carlo simulations of the data and compute the auto - correlation and cross - correlation in the same way as the actual data .",
    "the results of these simulations ( dashed lines in figure 1 ) show good agreement with the actual correlations functions , demonstrating the validity of the model .",
    "denoting the atmospheric signal by @xmath10 and the signal due to the instrumental noise by @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , in channels 1 and 2 respectively , combining the results of both channels the variance of the stacked scan is @xmath14 ^ 2>=\\frac{1}{4}\\{4<a^2>+<r_1 ^ 2>+<r_2 ^ 2>\\}.\\ ] ] however , ignoring the correlation due to the atmosphere we would obtain ( incorrectly ) @xmath15 and therefore the noise would be underestimated by a factor @xmath16 , where @xmath17 this is an extension of expression ( 1 ) in davies ( 1996 ) for the case in which the instrumental noise in both channels is not exactly the same . in cmb experiments which consist of two channels ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) usually the signal is computed comparing the sum @xmath20 ( which contains the signal plus the noise ) and the difference @xmath21 ( which only contains the noise see hancock 1994 ) . in this case , is easy to show that , ignoring the correlated term , there is an overestimation of the noise in the @xmath21 scan by a factor @xmath22 .",
    "this factor is a consequence of the subtraction of part of the noise ( the atmospheric part ) when the difference @xmath21  scan is computed . in the limit in which the atmospheric noise is negligible",
    "as compared with the instrumental noise , we obtain @xmath23 , as expected ; in the case in which the atmospheric noise is much more larger than the instrumental noise we obtain @xmath24 and @xmath25 and then simultaneous observations with two channels are fully redundant .    for the tenerife cmb data at dec=+40 , it is possible to distinguish between the instrumental and the atmospheric noise by analyzing the distribution of the cross - correlation between both channels , as explained above .",
    "the deduced @xmath26 and @xmath27 factors have the values quoted in table  1 .",
    "as expected , the table indicates that the data which are more affected are the 33 ghz . the mean correlation between channels is larger at 15 ghz than at 10 ghz as can be seen in figure 1 , however in table  1 the @xmath28 factors are similar for both instruments ;",
    "the reason for this is that one of the channels at 15 ghz was not operating due to a malfunction most of the time .",
    "the data at 15 and 33 ghz were recorded in different campaigns and therefore there are not an extra factor due to the correlated part between data at these two frequencies .    how this re - estimation of the error - bars affects the analyses of the estimation of the cmb signal ?",
    "table  1 of hancock ( 1994 ) computed the rms of the astronomical signal ( @xmath29 ) present at each frequency from the signals in the @xmath20 ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath31 ) scans , @xmath32 .",
    "as has been shown above , these values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are affected by the atmospheric signal common to both channels .",
    "following the formalism explained above , i have computed the atmospheric @xmath33 and astronomical signals @xmath34 presented in each of the final stacked scans and corrected the values quoted in table  1 of hancock ( 1994 ) .",
    "the new and old ( @xmath35 ) values are presented in columns 4 , 5 and 6 of table 1 .",
    "the correlated noise also affects to the likelihood analysis .",
    "the re - estimation of the error - bars presented above is equivalent to increasing the diagonal term in the covariance matrix .",
    "figure 2 presents the likelihood curves for the 15 , 33 and combined 15 + 33 data with the old ( @xmath10 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) and the new ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) estimation of the noise in the case of a harrison - zeldovich spectrum for the primordial fluctuations .",
    "all the cases show evidence of a clear well - defined maximum and similar shapes after the re - estimation of the error - bars . however , the value of the peak is smaller with the new estimation .",
    "for instance , in the 15 + 33 data the likelihood peak normalized with respect to the value for zero signal changes from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "this indicates a lower significance of the detection . using a bayessian analysis for the 15 + 33 data and assuming a harrison - zeldovich for the spectrum of the primordial fluctuations , a normalization of @xmath43 @xmath8k was obtained ; with the new estimation of the error - bars in the stacked data it is obtained @xmath44 @xmath8k .",
    "this detection is still very significant and it would be necessary to increase the error - bars artificially by a factor as large as @xmath45 to make the likelihood curve compatible with pure noise .",
    "figure 2 also presents ( panels @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) the likelihood curves of the @xmath21 with the new error - bars . in the three cases the scans",
    "are compatible with noise , emphasyzing that the detected signals are common to both channels and frequencies .",
    "the formalism presented in last section can be easily generalized for any other experiment with @xmath2 simultaneous channels operating at different frequencies . specifically for experiments working at mm wavelengths",
    ", it is expected that atmospheric noise would be the main source of noise ( piccirillo 1997 ) . following the results of the previous section",
    ", it will be considered an experiment in which the contribution due to the atmosphere is equivalent to gaussian noise uncorrelated point to point with a certain dependence in frequency .",
    "the result in each channel consists of the signal on the sky plus two components , the first due to thermal uncorrelated noise and the second which is correlated in some degree between the different channels .",
    "i assume that the noise in the i-@xmath49 channel is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the contribution of the atmosphere which has a spectral dependence @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the part due to the thermal noise . when the results of the @xmath2 channels are combined , the variance of the stacked scan is @xmath54\\ ] ]",
    "@xmath55 however , if we ignore the correlation due to the atmosphere we would incorrectly obtain @xmath56 and therefore we would underestimate the noise by a factor @xmath57 especially if @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and when @xmath60 , @xmath61 . in the case of two channels operating at the same frequency , the expression of section 2 is recovered .",
    "the factor @xmath62 , when we compute the noise in the difference between channels @xmath48 and @xmath63 , is @xmath64",
    "in this paper it has been shown how the presence of correlated noise affects the estimation of the error - bars when data from several channels are combined .",
    "this is particularly interesting in cases of poor signal - to noise - ratios like the cmb observations .",
    "it has been shown that for the tenerife experiments the atmosphere can be modeled like gaussian noise uncorrelated between adjacent measurements .",
    "the net effect , in this case , is an enhancement of the error - bars in the final stacked scans .",
    "the maximum effect is at 33 ghz where more than half of the noise is atmospheric in origin . with the new estimation of the noise ,",
    "the likelihood analysis of the tenerife data at dec.=+40  shows the presence of clear cmb signals corresponding to an expected quadrupole @xmath44 @xmath8k , a value slightly smaller in amplitude and in statistical significance than the old estimation presented in hancock ( 1994 ) .",
    "obviously , the effect is highly dependent on the observing technique ; for instance the preliminary analysis of the data of the tenerife interferometer at 33 ghz does not show evidence of correlated noise between the sine and cosine channels , even in cases of relatively bad weather .",
    "i have assumed here that the origin of the correlated noise between channels is the atmosphere , but the formalism can be applied independently of the physical origin of the noise .",
