    "<S> we explore the possibility of using quantum walks on graphs to find structural anomalies , such as extra edges or loops , on a graph . </S>",
    "<S> we focus our attention on star graphs , whose edges are like spokes coming out of a central hub . if there are @xmath0 spokes , we show that a quantum walk can find an extra edge connecting two of the spokes or a spoke with a loop on it in @xmath1 steps . </S>",
    "<S> we initially find that if all of the spokes have loops except one , the walk will not find the spoke without a loop , but this can be fixed if we choose the phase with which the particle is reflected from the vertex without the loop . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , quantum walks can , under some circumstances , be used to find structural anomalies in graphs .    </S>",
    "<S> a quantum walk is a quantum version of a random walk @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both types of walks occur on a graph , which is a set vertices connected by edges . </S>",
    "<S> a particle making a quantum walk behaves differently from one making a classical random walk , because the mathematical objects that govern its motion are amplitudes rather than probabilities , and this means that interference effects will play a role . </S>",
    "<S> there are two basic types of quantum walks , one in which time progresses in discrete steps @xcite and the other in which time is continuous @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we shall be concerned with a particular version of the discrete - time walk known as the scattering quantum walk @xcite . in this type of quantum </S>",
    "<S> walk the particle resides on the edges and scatters at the vertices at each time step . </S>",
    "<S> recently considerable experimental progress on implementing quantum walks has been made @xcite - @xcite , and recent review of the entire subject can be found in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum walks have been used to develop quantum algorithms , and this had proven to be a fruitful approach @xcite - @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they were first used to conduct searches on graphs @xcite - @xcite . in a quantum walk </S>",
    "<S> search the properties of one of the vertices differs from that of the others , often by doing what the other vertices do but adding a sign flip , and this marks that vertex . </S>",
    "<S> the object of the search is to find the marked vertex . </S>",
    "<S> quantum walk searches have been explored on a number of types of graphs , including , hypercubes , grids and complete graphs . </S>",
    "<S> recently it has also been shown that quantum walks can find marked edges and a marked complete subgraph of a complete graph @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we would like to explore a different question , whether quantum walks can find structural anomalies in graphs . </S>",
    "<S> we will look in some detail at the problem of finding an extra edge in a particular type of graph , and then present results on finding other types of anomalous elements .    </S>",
    "<S> we will consider what we call a star graph . </S>",
    "<S> this graph has a high degree of symmetry , which means that analyzing walks on it becomes relatively simple , because the hilbert space in which the walk occurs is of relatively small dimension @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this graph has a central vertex , which we shall label @xmath2 , and @xmath0 additional vertices , which we shall label @xmath3 through @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the central vertex is connected to each of the other vertices by an edge , and , for now , the vertices @xmath4 are not connected to each other by edges . in order to construct a quantum walk on this graph we first need a hilbert space for the particle making the walk . </S>",
    "<S> we specify this by means of an orthonormal basis consisting of the states @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the state @xmath6 corresponds to the particle being on the edge between @xmath2 and @xmath7 going from @xmath2 to @xmath7 , and the state @xmath8 corresponds to the particle again being on the edge between @xmath2 and @xmath7 , but now going from @xmath7 to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> next we need a unitary operator that advances the walk one time step . </S>",
    "<S> that is provided by the collective action of unitaries at each vertex that tell how the particle scatters as it passes through that vertex . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath9 is the unitary that advances the walk one step , it acts on a particle entering the vertex @xmath2 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the particle has an amplitude of @xmath13 of being reflected and an amplitude @xmath14 of being transmitted to one of the other edges . </S>",
    "<S> we now need to choose what happens at the vertices @xmath3 through @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> if we make the choice @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we obtain an implementation of the grover search algorithm . starting with an equal superposition of all of the basis states , after @xmath1 steps the particle </S>",
    "<S> will be located on the edge connecting the vertices @xmath2 and @xmath3 .        </S>",
    "<S> here we wish to do something different . </S>",
    "<S> first , let s add an edge between vertices @xmath3 and @xmath18 . the unitary operator will now act as @xmath15 for @xmath19 , and @xmath20 note that we have assumed that vertices @xmath3 and @xmath18 transmit the particle , and there is no reflection . </S>",
    "<S> one can put in an amplitude for reflection , but if it is not too large , this does not change our results appreciably . the walk resulting from this choice of @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> can be analyzed easily , because it stays within a five - dimensional subspace of the entire hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> define the states @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the unitary transformation , @xmath9 , that advances the walk one step acts on these states as follows : @xmath22 for our initial state we choose @xmath23 which is in @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> since the initial state is in @xmath24 , and @xmath24 is an invariant subspace of @xmath9 , the entire walk will remain in @xmath24 , and this reduces the complexity of our problem considerably . </S>",
    "<S> we should mention that the minus sign in the first expression for initial state is essential ; if it is replaced by a plus sign , the search will fail .    in order to find the evolution of the quantum state for the walk , we find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath9 restricted to @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives us the spectral representation of @xmath9 and makes finding @xmath25 , the operator that will advance the walk @xmath26 steps , straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> we then find that , to good approximation assuming that @xmath0 is large , @xmath27 where the first entry is the coefficient of @xmath28 , the second is the coefficient of @xmath29 , etc . , and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the state of the walk after @xmath26 steps . from this equation , and </S>",
    "<S> the definitions of @xmath28 through @xmath31 , we see that when @xmath32 , the particle is located on one of the edges leading to the extra edge or on the extra edge itself . </S>",
    "<S> this will happen when @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now need to discuss how to interpret this result . </S>",
    "<S> it is reasonable to assume that if we are given a graph with an extra edge in an unknown location , we only have access to the edges connecting the central vertex to the outer ones , and not to the extra edge itself ( if we had access to the extra edge , then we would have to know where it is ) . </S>",
    "<S> that is , in making a measurement , we can only determine which of the edges connecting central vertex to to the outer ones the particle is on . </S>",
    "<S> if it is on the extra edge , we will not detect it . </S>",
    "<S> so , after @xmath26 steps , where @xmath32 , we measure the edges to which we have access to find out where the particle is . with probability @xmath34 it will be on an edge connected to the extra edge , and with probability @xmath35 it will be on the extra edge itself , in which case we wo nt detect it .    in comparing this procedure to a classical search for the extra edge </S>",
    "<S> , we shall assume that classically the graph is specified by an adjacency list , which is an efficient specification for sparse graphs . </S>",
    "<S> for each vertex of the graph , one lists the vertices that are connected to it by an edge . in our case </S>",
    "<S> , the central vertex is connected to all of the other vertices , the vertices not connected to the extra edge are connected only to the central vertex , and two of the outer vertices are connected to the central vertex and to each other . searching this list </S>",
    "<S> classically would require @xmath36 steps to find the extra edge , while the quantum procedure will succeed in @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> one can ask whether other structural anomalies can be detected by means of a quantum walk . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility is to take the basic star graph and add a loop to one of the outer vertices , say vertex @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> if we call the state corresponding to the particle being on the loop @xmath37 , the unitary time - step operator would act on the states going into the outer vertices as @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath15 for @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the action of @xmath9 for states going into the central vertex is as before . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the calculations for this walk will be presented elsewhere , but the result is similar to what we found in the case of the extra edge . </S>",
    "<S> starting with the same initial state as before , if @xmath40 , then with probability @xmath34 the particle will be on the edge connecting vertex @xmath3 to the central vertex , and with probability @xmath35 it will be on the loop itself . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a quantum walk can be used to find the vertex with the loop attached in @xmath1 steps .    </S>",
    "<S> a second possibility is simply to extend one of the edges . </S>",
    "<S> one adds an extra edge and and extra vertex , which we shall call @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> one end of this edge is attached to vertex @xmath3 , and the other to vertex @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> vertex @xmath41 is connected only to vertex @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the unitary time - step operator now acts on the states going into the outer vertices as @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath15 for @xmath16 . for an initial state one </S>",
    "<S> chooses an arbitrary superposition of all of the states going out , @xmath45 and all of the states going in , @xmath46 . for any initial state of this type , </S>",
    "<S> if one then runs a quantum walk on this graph , the particle does not become localized on the extra edge or on the edge leading to it in @xmath1 steps . </S>",
    "<S> so , in this case , the quantum walk fails to find the structural anomaly with a quantum speedup .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us see whether a quantum walk can find a missing element . </S>",
    "<S> suppose we add loops to all of the outer vertices of our star graph except for one , say , as usual , vertex 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall designate the loop state connected to vertex @xmath7 by @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the action of the unitary time - step operator on the outer vertices is now @xmath48 , and for @xmath16 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . as in the previous case , </S>",
    "<S> starting with a state that is an arbitrary superposition of the ingoing and outgoing states , we find that for no initial state of this type does the particle become localized on the edge without the loop in @xmath1 steps , so that the quantum walk again fails to find the anomaly with a quantum speedup .    </S>",
    "<S> these failures can be turned into successes , however , if we make a small modification to the walks . in the case of the extra edge </S>",
    "<S> , suppose that instead of @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 , with the action of @xmath9 on all of the other states being the same as before . then with an initial state that is an arbitrary superposition of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the particle will be localized on the extra edge and the edge leading to it in @xmath1 steps . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is very much reminiscent of the standard grover search .    </S>",
    "<S> the case of the missing loop is more interesting . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that instead of @xmath48 , we have that @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the particle will be localized on the edge with the missing loop in @xmath1 steps , if @xmath56 , and if the initial state is properly chosen . in order to explain this last point , </S>",
    "<S> let us rephrase the problem slightly . </S>",
    "<S> we will add a dummy loop to the vertex @xmath3 , @xmath37 , where @xmath57 , that does not participate in the dynamics ( we still have @xmath58 ) . </S>",
    "<S> so our search problem becomes finding the vertex with the dummy loop . </S>",
    "<S> define the state @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> now , for the case @xmath60 we will have a successful quantum walk search , i.e. the particle will become localized on the edge connected to the dummy loop in @xmath1 steps , if we start in the state @xmath61 and in the case @xmath62 the proper initial state is @xmath63 therefore , by adjusting the phase on the edge with the dummy loop and choosing the proper initial state , the quantum walk can find the location of the dummy loop in @xmath1 steps .    </S>",
    "<S> we have found that a successful quantum walk search on a modified star graph is associated with a degenerate eigenvalue of the unperturbed problem . </S>",
    "<S> the unperturbed evolution operator , @xmath64 , is obtained by setting @xmath65 and @xmath66 in matrix for @xmath9 ( this is the @xmath67 limit of @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbation , @xmath68 is small if @xmath0 is large . if an eigenvalue of @xmath64 is simple , we have found that adding the perturbation adds a correction to it of order @xmath69 , while if it is degenerate , adding @xmath70 removes the degeneracy , and one obtains corrections of order @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath25 can be expressed as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is an eigenvalue of @xmath9 and @xmath74 is the projection onto the corresponding eigenvector . because @xmath9 is unitary , </S>",
    "<S> its eigenvalues have a magnitude of one . </S>",
    "<S> now suppose that @xmath75 $ ] , where @xmath76 is the corresponding eigenvalue of @xmath64 and @xmath77 is the correction due to @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> for the quantum search to succeed in @xmath1 steps , i.e. @xmath78 , the effect of @xmath70 on the state , which is given by @xmath79 , must be significant </S>",
    "<S> . this will be true if @xmath80 , but not if @xmath81 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that quantum walks can find structural anomalies in graphs , and not just marked elements . here , </S>",
    "<S> only a few examples have been studied , so the question of what kinds of anomalies on what kinds of graphs can be efficiently found by means of a quantum walk is largely open . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it has been found that if one removes an edge from a complete graph , merely adjusting the the reflection and transmission amplitudes of the affected vertices to maintain unitarity , a quantum walk will not efficiently find the missing edge @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this leads one to ask whether there are structural changes one can make in a complete graph that will be efficiently found in a quantum walk search . </S>",
    "<S> questions such as this remain for the future . </S>",
    "<S> however , what we have found here suggests that the types of objects that can be found by a quantum walk search go beyond just marked vertices . </S>"
