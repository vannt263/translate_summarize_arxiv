    "recently , solitons on a finite background , generated by the fundamental nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation with self - focusing , which have been known for a long time , have drawn renewed interest as prototypes of rogue waves in the ocean kharif_book , kharif , slunyaev , zakharov , ruban , andonowati , optical fibers solli1,akhmediev3,natphys , kibler1,hammani , erkintalo , plasmas @xcite and other nonlinear media .",

    "collisions between abs @xcite , their dynamics in optical fibers with a longitudinally tailored dispersion @xcite , and shaping of an optical frequency comb into a generator of rogue waves @xcite have been demonstrated too . in these experiments ,",
    "the abs and kmss were excited by weakly and strongly modulated continuous waves ( cws ) , respectively .",
    "generally , nls solutions initiated by perturbations added to a finite background feature strong temporal compression of emerging peaks @xcite . in optical systems , such dynamical scenarios can be used for the generation of supercontinuum , and of high - power ultrashort pulses and pulse trains dudley , solli3,mussot , dudley1,taki .    to create high - repetition - rate and high - quality pulse trains ,",
    "the delay - line interferometer was used to eliminate the finite background around the ab and allow doubling of the repetition rate of the pulse trains @xcite .",

    "as said above , the standard nls equation is valid as the model for picosecond pulses with the width @xmath0ps , while in the subpicosecond or femtosecond regime higher - order terms should be included , to account for the third - order dispersion ( tod ) , self - steepening , and the raman effect kodama , agrawal .",

    "equation ( [ model ] ) does not include the fiber loss , assuming , as usual , that it may by compensated by gain kodama , agrawal . at the end of sec .",
    "iii , we produce results of the analysis of the model which explicitly includes the loss , the conclusion being that the difference is relatively small except for a decreasing of peak power .    by means of rescaling , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , with the temporal scale @xmath15^{1/2}$ ] and dispersion length @xmath16 ,",

    "a natural question is whether such a double - repetition - rate high - power train can stably propagate in the framework of the fiber model . to address this issue ,",

    "the parameters are @xmath108 , @xmath90 fs , and @xmath109,width=321 ]    to summarize the dynamical results outlined above , in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we present the largest - compression position @xmath110 for the pulse trains , their peak power , the fwhm of the central pulse in the double pulse trains constructed with the help of the delay - line interferometer method , and the corresponding frequency shift accumulated after the @xmath104 km long propagation , as functions of parameters @xmath41 and @xmath92 in inputs ( ab_initial ) and ( [ ma - initial ] ) , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , one can see that , for the same modulation intensity , the position of the strongest compression corresponding to initial condition ( [ ma - initial ] ) is always smaller than its counterpart corresponding to input ( [ ab_initial ] ) .",
    "interestingly , for the double pulse train induced by the latter input , the peak power and the fwhm of the central pulse are almost constant for the present parameters , which leads to the nearly constant frequency shift at @xmath104 km . on the other hand , for the double pulse train induced by input ( [ ma - initial ] ) , the peak power increases , and the fwhm decreases , with the increase of the modulation intensity , which implies that this input can be used to generate the pulse train with the higher peak power and narrower width . however , in the same case , the frequency shift at @xmath111 km increases with the increase of the modulation intensity in a staircase fashion , as shown in fig . [ fig5](d ) .",
    "furthermore , from figs . [ fig5](b ) and ( c ) one can find that the corresponding soliton numbers are in the range of @xmath112 , each pulse in the double pulse trains eventually reshaping into the fundamental soliton , as seen in figs .",
    "fig3(c ) and [ fig4](c ) . comparing with figs . [ fig1](d ) and fig2(d ) , one can see that raman effect is helpful for the formation of solitons over a shorter propagation distance , as was shown in a different context in ref .",
    "@xcite .     except for @xmath113.,width=321 ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) it can be seen that the pulse width in the trains is less than @xmath114 ps ( here the pulse width is taken equal to fwhm/@xmath115 agrawal ) , and it may fall in the subpicosecond range for larger values of modulation intensity @xmath92 .",
    "these widths are small enough to make it necessary using the extended model based on eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) , rather than the simple nls equation which does not include higher - order terms .",
    "to additionally illustrate this point , we have performed simulations of the propagation dynamics of the train initiated by input ( [ ma - initial ] ) with @xmath116 in the subpicosecond range . in this case , the maximally compressed pulse train is attained at a shorter distance @xmath117 km in comparison with fig .",
    "subsequently , the use of the delay - line interferometer produces the double pulse train with the fwhm of the central pulse @xmath118 ps ( the corresponding pulse width is @xmath119 fs ) and peak power @xmath120 w. the corresponding robust evolution of the double pulse train is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) . comparing with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we conclude that the spectrum range is wider , the frequency shift is larger , and the peak power is higher because the pulse width becomes narrower , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig6](b ) and ( c ) .    , but with fiber loss @xmath121 db / km.,width=321 ]    note that the above considerations disregarded fiber loss , assuming that it might be compensated by gain",
    "here , we display an example which explicitly takes the loss into account , and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , in which the maximally compressed pulse train is attained at a somewhat longer distance , i.e. , @xmath122  @xmath123 km ( it was @xmath124 km without fiber loss ) and the peak power of the corresponding double pulse train is decreased to @xmath125 w , from @xmath126 w in the lossless fiber .",
    "comparing with fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we see that the propagation scenario is not strongly affected by the loss . of course , the loss produces stronger effects over large propagation distances ( @xmath127 km ) , in which case periodic compensation provided by gain should be explicitly taken into account .",
    "using exact solutions of the hirota equation for the soliton on the finite background , including the ab ( akhmediev breather ) and kms ( kuznetsov - ma solution ) , the double high - power pulse trains with zero - background have been constructed .",
    "the results demonstrate that the double trains , built as superpositions of the maximally compressed pulse trains with opposite signs and a half - period time delay , propagate preserving their shape .",
    "the dynamics of the trains generated by the modulated cws in the realistic fiber model has been simulated too , demonstrating that they can propagate robustly , with the red frequency shift caused by the raman effect .",
    "comparing different initial conditions , we have concluded that input ( [ ma - initial ] ) is more suitable for generating the pulse trains with a higher peak power and narrower width , the corresponding raman - induced frequency shift being larger too , exhibiting a staircase dependence on the cw - modulation parameters .",
