    "in the past decade , distributed consensus algorithms have attracted a significant amount of research attention @xcite , due to their wide applications in distributed control and estimation @xcite , distributed signal processing @xcite , and distributed optimization methods @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that a network of interconnected nodes with different initial values can reach a common value , namely an agreement or a consensus , via local information exchange as long as the communication graph is well connected .",
    "the consensus value is informative in the sense that it can depend on all nodes initial states even if the value is not the exact average @xcite ; the consensus processes are robust against random or deterministic switching of network interactions as well as against noises @xcite .    as a generalized notion ,",
    "constrained consensus seeks to reach state agreement in the intersection of a number of convex sets , where each set serves as the supporting state space for a particular node @xcite .",
    "it was shown that with doubly stochastic arc weights , a projected consensus algorithm , where each node iteratively projects a weighted average of its neighbor s values onto its supporting set , can guarantee convergence to constrained consensus when the intersection set is bounded and contains an interior point @xcite .",
    "this idea was then extended to the continuous - time case under which the graph connectivity and arc weight conditions can be relaxed with convergence still being guaranteed @xcite .",
    "the projected consensus algorithm was shown to be convergent even under randomized projections @xcite .",
    "in fact , those developments are closely related to a class of so - called alternating projection algorithms , which was first studied by von neumann in the 1940s @xcite and then extensively investigated across the past many decades @xcite .",
    "a related but different intriguing problem lies in how to develop distributed algorithms that solve a linear algebraic equation @xmath7 with respect to variable @xmath8 , to which tremendous efforts have been devoted with many algorithms developed under different assumptions of information exchanges among the nodes @xcite .",
    "naturally , we can assume that a node @xmath1 has access to a row vector , @xmath2 of @xmath3 as well as the corresponding entry , @xmath4 in @xmath5 .",
    "each node will then be able to determine with straightforward calculations an affine subspace whose elements satisfy the equation @xmath9 .",
    "this means that , as long as the original equation @xmath0 has a nonempty solution set , solving the equation would be equivalent to finding a point in the intersection of all the affine subspaces and therefore can be put into the constrained consensus framework . if however the linear equation has no exact solution and its least squares solutions are of interest , we ended up with a convex optimization problem with quadratic cost and linear constraints .",
    "many distributed optimization algorithms , such as @xcite , developed for much more complex models , can therefore be directly applied .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the above ideas of distributed consensus and optimization were traced back to the seminal work of bertsekas and j. tsitsiklis @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study two distributed network flows as distributed solvers for such linear algebraic equations in continuous time .",
    "the first so - called  consensus + projection \" flow consists of two additive terms , one from standard consensus dynamics and the other contributing to projection onto each affine subspace .",
    "the second  projection consensus \" flow on the other hand simply replaces the relative state feedback in consensus dynamics with projected relative state feedback .",
    "essentially only relative state information is exchanged among the nodes for both of the two flows , which justifies their full _",
    "distributedness_. to study the asymptotic behaviours of the two distributed flows with respect to the solutions of the linear equation , new challenges arise in the loss of intersection boundedness and interior points for the exact solution case as well as in the complete loss of intersection sets for the least squares solution case . as a result",
    ", the analysis can not be simply mapped back to the studies in @xcite .",
    "the contributions of the current paper are summarized as follows .",
    "* under mild conditions on the communication graphs ( without requiring a dwell - time for switching graphs and only requiring a positively lower bound on the integral of arc weights over certain time intervals ) , we prove that all node states asymptotically converge to a common solution of the linear algebraic equation for the two flows , if there is any .",
    "the convergence is global for the  consensus + projection \" flow , and local for the  projection consensus \" flow in the sense that the initial values must be put into the affine subspaces ( which is a very minor restriction indeed ) .",
    "we manage to characterize the node limits for balanced or fixed graphs . *",
    "if the linear equation has no exact solutions , we show that the node states can be forced to converge to a ball of fixed but arbitrarily small radius surround the least squares solution by taking the gain of the consensus dynamics to be sufficiently large for  consensus + projection \" flow under fixed and undirected graphs .",
    "semi - global convergence to approximate least squares solutions is established for switching balanced directed graphs under suitable conditions . a minor , but more explicit result arises where it is also shown that the  projection consensus \" flow drives the average of the node states to the least squares solution with complete communication graphs .",
    "these results rely on our development of new technique of independent interest for treating the interplay between consensus dynamics and the projections onto affine subspaces in the absence of intersection boundedness and interior point assumptions .",
    "all the convergence results can be sharpened to provide exponential convergence with suitable conditions on the switching graph signals .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : problem ] introduces the network model , presents the distributed flows under consideration , and defines the problem of interest .",
    "section [ sec : exact ] discusses the scenario where the linear equation has at least one solution .",
    "section [ sec : least - squares ] then turns to the least squares case where the linear equation has no solution at all .",
    "finally , section [ sec : numerical ] presents a few numerical examples illustrating the established results and section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper with a few remarks .",

    "depending on the argument , @xmath29 stands for the absolute value of a real number or the cardinality of a set .",

    "it is then clear that case ( i ) is equivalent to the condition that @xmath48 is a singleton , and that case ( ii ) is equivalent to the condition that @xmath48 is an affine space with a nontrivial dimension . for case ( iii ) , a least squaress solution of ( [ linearequation ] ) can be defined via the following optimization problem : @xmath49 which yields a unique solution @xmath50 if @xmath40 .",

    "the dynamics described in systems ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) are linear , in contrast to the nonlinear dynamics associated with the general convex sets studied in @xcite .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize that new challenges arise with the systems ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) compared to the work of @xcite .",
    "first of all , for both of the cases ( i ) and ( ii ) , @xmath48 contains no interior point .",
    "this interior point condition however is essential to the results in @xcite .",
    "next , for case ( ii ) where @xmath48 is an affine space with a nontrivial dimension , the boundedness condition for the intersection of the convex sets no longer holds , which plays a key role in the analysis of @xcite .",

    "the least squares solution case then completely falls out from the discussions of constrained consensus in @xcite .",
    "we have assumed hitherto that each node @xmath1 only has access to the value of @xmath6 and @xmath52 from the equation ( [ linearequation ] ) and therefore there are a total of @xmath107 nodes .",
    "alternatively and as a generalization , there can be @xmath108 nodes with node @xmath1 holding @xmath109 rows , denoted @xmath110 of @xmath111 with @xmath112 . in this case",
    ", we can revise the definition of @xmath91 to @xmath113 which is nonempty if ( [ linearequation ] ) has at least one solution .",
    "then the two flows ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) can be defined in the same manner for the @xmath114 nodes .",
    "of course , if @xmath115 is large , finding an initial condition consistent with @xmath91 becomes computationally more burdensome .",

    "@xmath116 note that , the @xmath91 are still affine subspaces , while solving ( [ linearequation ] ) exactly continues to be equivalent to finding a point in @xmath117 .",
    "consequently , all our results for cases ( i ) and ( ii ) apply also to this new setting with row grouping .",
    "in this section , we show how the two distributed flows asymptotically solve the equation ( [ linearequation ] ) under quite general conditions for cases ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "we first focus on the case when eq .",

    "it was suggested in @xcite that one can add another term in the  projection consensus \" flow and arrive at @xmath124 for @xmath125 , then convergence will be global under ( [ 100 ] ) .",
    "we would like to point out that ( [ 100 ] ) has a similar structure as the  consensus + projection \" flow with the consensus dynamics being replaced by projection consensus .",
    "in fact , our analysis of the  consensus + projection \" flow developed in this paper can be refined and generalized to the flow ( [ 100 ] ) and then leads to results under the same graph conditions for both exact and least squares solutions .",
