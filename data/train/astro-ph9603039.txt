    "a fundamental problem in cosmology is to understand how the spatial distribution of galaxies ( and of galaxy clusters ) is related to that of the underlying mass . in standard models of galaxy formation",
    ", it is assumed that galaxies form by the cooling and condensation of gas within dark matter halos ( white & rees 1978 ; white & frenk 1991 ) .",
    "nongravitational processes which can not be modeled reliably are likely to be critical in determining the properties of individual galaxies , yet they should have little effect on the formation and clustering of dark halos . as a result , the problem of galaxy biasing can be approached by first understanding how dark halos are distributed relative to the mass .",
    "dark halos are highly nonlinear objects and their formation and clustering has usually been studied using n - body simulations ( e.g. frenk 1991 ; gelb & bertschinger 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "such simulations are limited both in resolution and in dynamical range and can be difficult to interpret .",
    "our understanding of their results could be substantially enhanced by simple physical models and the analytic approximations they provide .",
    "mo & white ( 1996 ) have developed a model for the second order correlation functions of dark halos based on the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ; hereafter ps ) .",
    "here we extend their work to derive a model for the higher order correlations .",
    "we also work out a similar model for peaks in the initial density field .    in the ps formalism",
    ", one defines dark matter halos at any given time as regions of the initial density field which just collapse at that time according to a spherical infall model .",
    "this formalism can be extended so that it predicts not only the mass function of dark halos , but also a wide range of other statistical properties of the hierarchical clustering process ; comparisons with n - body simulation data show detailed agreement ( e.g. bond et al . 1991 ; bower 1991 ; kauffmann & white 1993 ; and particularly , lacey & cole , 1993 , 1994 ) .",
    "mo & white ( 1996 ) showed that the ps formalism and its extensions can be used to construct a model for the spatial correlation of dark halos in hierarchical models .",
    "they used the standard ps formalism both to define dark halos from the initial density field , and to specify how their mean abundance within a large spherical region is modulated by the linear mass overdensity in that region .",
    "the gravitationally induced evolution of clustering was treated by assuming that each region evolves as if spherically symmetric .",
    "the model was found to give an accurate description of the bias function , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mean overdensity of halos within spheres which have radius @xmath15 and _ mass _ overdensity @xmath16 .",
    "a simple extension provides a surprisingly accurate prediction for the halo - halo two - point correlation measured in n - body simulations ( mo & white 1996 ; mo , jing & white 1996 ) .",
    "it is clearly interesting to see if such a model can also be constructed for the higher order correlations of dark halos .    in the peak formalism",
    ", one assumes that galaxies form at those peaks of a suitably smoothed version of the initial density field which rise above some density threshold .",
    "kaiser ( 1984 ) introduced this idea to show how the strong clustering of abell clusters could result from the statistics of high peaks in a gaussian initial field .",
    "this formalism was later developed extensively by bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 , hereafter bbks ) .",
    "these authors showed that if galaxies can be associated with high peaks of the initial density field then they should be more strongly clustered than the mass , an effect usually called `` galaxy biasing '' .",
    "unfortunately it is not known how _",
    "well _ galaxies correspond to high peaks of the initial field , and it is unclear how to deal with the problem that the present - day clustering of peaks differs substantially from that in the initial ( lagrangian ) space because of gravitationally induced motions . as a result ,",
    "the predictions of the theory have only been checked quantitatively by direct n - body simulation of the motion of the material associated with density peaks ( e.g. davis et al .",
    "1985 ; frenk et al .",
    "1988 ; katz , quinn & gelb 1993 ) . in this paper",
    "we will show that the idea underlying the model of mo & white can also be used to construct a model for the correlation functions of peaks in _ physical _ space .",
    "we use the theory of bardeen et al . to define peaks from the initial density field , and to specify how their mean abundance within a large spherical region is modulated by the linear mass overdensity in that region .",
    "the gravitationally induced evolution of clustering is then treated , as in the model of mo & white , by assuming that each region evolves according to a spherical collapse model .",
    "we describe our model in  2 , and present detailed tests of its predictions against n - body simulations in  3 .",
    "then in  4 we demonstrate how it can be used to interpret the observed high order correlation functions of galaxies and of clusters of galaxies , and to determine whether or not galaxies are biased relative to mass .",
    "finally , in  5 we summarize our main results .",
    "to calculate the high order moments of peaks and halos ( together called `` galaxies '' ) , we use the general formalism developed by fry & gaztanaga ( 1993 ) .",
    "consider the present - day mass overdensity field @xmath17/\\barrho$ ] , where @xmath18 is the local mass density and @xmath19 the mean density .",
    "when smoothed in spherical window @xmath20 with characteristic radius @xmath15 , @xmath21 gives rise to a smoothed density field : @xmath22 for a top - hat window , @xmath23 is just the volume average of @xmath24 within a sphere of radius @xmath15 .",
    "the statistical properties of @xmath25 are described by the one - point distribution function of the density field .",
    "now let us denote the overabundance of `` galaxies '' in the same window by @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath27 is completely determined by @xmath28 , then we can write @xmath29 as a function of @xmath16 , @xmath30 , which should not depend on @xmath31 .",
    "( note that this can hold at best approximately ; see below . ) to simplify notation , we will omit writing explicitly the smoothing radius @xmath15 associated with @xmath16 and @xmath29 . in general , we can expand @xmath32 in taylor series : @xmath33 where @xmath34 are constant . fry & gaztanaga ( 1993 )",
    "have shown that if the volume averaged j - point mass correlation functions @xmath35 have the hierarchical form : @xmath36 then the transformation given by equation ( 2 ) preserves the hierarchical structure in the limit @xmath37 . in this case",
    "one can write @xmath38 and for @xmath1 , 4 and 5 , which are relevant for our later discussion , one has @xmath39",
    "@xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "thus to obtain the high order moments @xmath44 for halos and peaks in the quasilinear regime , we need to work out the coefficients @xmath34 in the bias relation ( equation 2 ) .",
    "we will do this in  2.2 and  2.3 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the bias relation given by equation ( 2 ) is at best approximate .",
    "this is because @xmath29 in a spherical region with mean mass overdensity @xmath16 must depend not only on @xmath16 but also on the internal structure of the region and on the external tides acting on it . as a result",
    ", there must be scatter in the `` galaxy '' counts among spheres with the same @xmath16 and @xmath15 .",
    "such scatter should also contribute to the high order moments . as discussed in mo & white ( 1996 ) , this contribution must be important on scales which are not much larger than the linear _ lagrangian _",
    "sizes of the `` galaxies '' . on larger scales it may or may not be important , and since it can not be estimated within our formalism , in the present paper we will assume it to be negligible and test the resulting predictions against n - body data .      the initial overdensity field @xmath45/{\\bar { \\rho}}$ ] is assumed to be gaussian and so to be described by a power spectrum @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the fourier transform of @xmath21 and @xmath48 is the dirac delta function .",
    "we smooth the field @xmath21 by convolving it with a spherically symmetric window function @xmath20 having _ comoving _ characteristic radius @xmath15 ( measured in current units ) .",
    "the smoothed field can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the fourier transform of the window function @xmath20 .",
    "following bbks , we define the order @xmath51 moment of the smoothed field by @xmath52 the order zero moment , which we denote by @xmath53 , is just the _ rms _ fluctuation of mass in the smoothing window .    for a given window function",
    "the smoothed field @xmath23 is gaussian and so has the following one - point distribution function @xmath54 since both @xmath16 and @xmath55 grow with time in the same manner in linear perturbation theory , it is convenient to use their values linearly extrapolated to the present time .",
    "these extrapolated quantities will still obey equation ( 8) . in the following , we write our formulae in terms of these extrapolated quantities .",
    "we will also omit writing explicitly the smoothing radius @xmath15 , but often use subscripts to distinguish @xmath56 , and other quantities , at different smoothing lengths [ e.g. @xmath57 , @xmath58 . as another convention",
    ", we will always label the properties of `` galaxies '' using a subscript `` 1 '' .",
    "the subscript `` 0 '' is reserved for the properties of larger uncollapsed spherical regions .",
    "mo & white ( 1996 ) have described in considerable detail how to derive the bias relation , @xmath59 , for dark halos ( so subscript `` h '' denotes `` halos '' ) in the ps formalism .",
    "here we adopt their notation and work out the coefficients @xmath34 in equation ( 2 ) that are needed in the calculations of @xmath60 .",
    "we assume that dark halos are spherically symmetric , virialized clumps of dark matter .",
    "the mass @xmath61 of a halo is then related to the comoving lagrangian radius @xmath62 of the region from which it formed by @xmath63 where @xmath19 is the mean density of the universe . in an einstein - de sitter universe ( which we assume throughout this paper ) , a spherical perturbation of linear overdensity @xmath64 collapses at redshift @xmath65 , where the critical overdensity for collapse @xmath66 . according to the ps formalism",
    ", the comoving number density of halos , expressed in current units , as a function of @xmath61 and @xmath67 is : @xmath68 notice that in this formalism a class of halos must be defined by specifying _ both _ their mass @xmath61 ( or equivalently @xmath62 or @xmath69 ) and their redshift of identification @xmath67 ( or equivalently @xmath64 ) .    to derive the bias relation ,",
    "we need formulae which relate halo abundances to the density field on larger scales .",
    "bower ( 1991 ) and bond et al .",
    "( 1991 ) extend the original ps formalism to show that the fraction of the mass in a region of lagrangian radius @xmath70 and linear overdensity @xmath71 which at redshift @xmath67 is contained in dark halos of mass @xmath61 ( where by definition @xmath72 ) is given by @xmath73 thus the average number of @xmath61 halos identified at redshift @xmath67 in a spherical region with comoving radius @xmath70 and overdensity @xmath71 is @xmath74    following mo & white ( 1996 ) , we obtain the _ physical _ space overabundance of halos in spheres which at the desired redshift @xmath75 have radius @xmath15 and overdensity @xmath16 , using a spherical model .",
    "in such a model , each spherical shell moves as a unit and different shells do not cross until they collapse through the zero radius .",
    "thus the mass interior to each mass shell is a constant , which gives @xmath76 furthermore , since dark halos in our ps model are defined to be objects identified at some specific redshift , the mean abundance of equation ( 12 ) can be taken as referring to halos of mass @xmath61 identified at redshift @xmath67 within spheres of radius @xmath77 and overdensity @xmath78 . under these assumptions the average overdensity of dark halos in spheres with current radius @xmath15 and current mass overdensity @xmath79 can be obtained from equations ( 10 ) and ( 12 ) : @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is determined from @xmath16 by the spherical collapse model , as described in the appendix . when considered as a function of @xmath79 , @xmath84 in equation ( 14 )",

    "we show predictions for the high order moments @xmath8 ( @xmath1 , 4 and 5 ) of `` galaxies '' as a function of the linear bias parameter @xmath198 [ defined by equations ( 15b ) and ( 24b ) for halos and peaks , respectively ] .",
    "each curve corresponds to a particular choice of @xmath64 , as parameterized by the value of @xmath65 given in the figure caption .",
    "as an example , we show results for a cdm - like spectrum with @xmath167 and @xmath199 and for a radius @xmath200 .",
    "the spectrum chosen here is consistent with that given by the angular correlation functions of galaxies in the apm survey ( efstathiou , sutherland & maddox 1990 ; see also maddox et al .",
    "1996 for a recent discussion ) .",
    "the main features in @xmath8 do not change significantly if we change the value of @xmath201 from 0.2 to 0.5 .",
    "the choice of @xmath15 is based on the fact that the mass density field in the universe is still in the quasilinear regime on this scales and that high order moments of galaxies are difficult to measure on much larger scales . for halos with fixed @xmath67 and @xmath10 ,",
    "@xmath202 depend only on @xmath203 which , in turn , depend only on the effective power index at @xmath15 : @xmath204 . for peaks , however , @xmath205 depend , in addition , also on the shape of the spectrum on the peak scales @xmath62 [ through the dependence on @xmath206 defined in equation 18 ] . for a given shape of power spectrum , the dependence of @xmath207 on @xmath161 is weak ,",
    "once @xmath10 and @xmath64 are fixed .",
    "the values of @xmath8 in the quasilinear regime depend only weakly on cosmology , as pointed out in  2.2 .    from fig.5 we see that the @xmath8 for `` galaxies '' are systematically smaller than those for the mass , unless the linear bias parameter @xmath10 is comparable to or less than unity .",
    "the values of @xmath8 are more or less constant for large @xmath10 , but decrease rapidly with increasing @xmath10 for @xmath208 . for a given @xmath10 ,",
    "@xmath8 are higher for dark halos that are identified at an earlier epoch and for density peaks with higher @xmath64 .",
    "the values of @xmath8 are the lowest for `` galaxies '' with @xmath209 and @xmath12 .",
    "these results have interesting implications for the observed high order moments of galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "let us start with clusters of galaxies .",
    "clusters of galaxies are found to have much larger two - point correlation amplitude than galaxies ( see e.g. bahcall & west 1992 ; peacock & west 1992 ; dalton et al .",
    "1992 ; nichol et al .",
    "if the two - point correlation function of galaxies is neither significantly _ smaller _ than that of the mass nor larger than that of the mass by a factor exceeding three , the value of the linear bias factor for clusters should lie somewhere between 2 and 5 .",
    "if we take clusters to be virialized halos identified at present time , figure 5 shows that the skewness ( @xmath210 ) and kurtosis ( @xmath211 ) of clusters should be about 2 and 7 , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with current observations .",
    "based on the three - point correlation functions of abell clusters , jing & zhang ( 1989 ) found @xmath212 which corresponds to @xmath213 ( see also plionis & valdarnini 1994 and cappi & maurogordato 1995 who did count - in - cell analysis for abell clusters and confirmed that @xmath213 ) .",
    "recently , gaztanaga , croft & dalton ( 1995 ) obtained @xmath213 and @xmath214 for clusters in the apm survey .",
    "these values of skewness and kurtosis appear to be much smaller than the corresponding values for the mass distribution obtained from a power spectrum which has the shape expected given the angular correlation functions of apm galaxies ( see e.g. gaztanaga et al .",
    "1995 ) . from our model",
    "we see that such low values are a result of clusters being high mass halos identified at low redshift .    for optical galaxies ,",
    "the current best estimates of the high order moments are those of gaztanaga ( 1994 ) based on apm survey .",
    "the values he got are @xmath215 , @xmath216 and @xmath217 for @xmath9 .",
    "these results are plotted in fig.5 as circles with errorbars . as noticed by gaztanaga & frieman ( 1994 )",
    ", the observed values for apm galaxies appear to be close to those for the mass ( the values predicted by quasilinear theory are indicated by the horizontal solid lines in fig.5 ) . comparing our predictions with the observational results we infer that galaxies in the apm survey should not be strongly biased relative to the mass .",
    "namely , the linear bias parameter for apm galaxies should not be significantly larger than unity .",
    "mild antibias ( i.e. @xmath208 ) is possible if most apm galaxies are associated with galactic - sized halos which form rather late .",
    "we note , however , that gaztanaga ( 1992 ) found significantly smaller values @xmath218 and @xmath219 from the fully 3-dimensional cfa and ssrs surveys .",
    "gaztanaga ( 1994 ) argues that these small values reflect the fact that the volumes of the local surveys are too small to be fair .",
    "redshift distortion present in these surveys may also complicate the determination of the high - order correlations in real space .",
    "nevertheless , if these lower values turn out to be correct ( for example if there is some problem in deriving @xmath220 and @xmath221 from the 2-dimensional apm data ) then our analysis would suggest that the apm galaxies could be substantially biased relative to the mass .",
    "future redshift samples from large digital sky surveys will certainly help to resolve the problem .",
    "the skewness and kurtosis of spiral galaxies and iras galaxies appear to be much lower than those for apm galaxies , with @xmath222 and @xmath223 ( e.g. jing et al . 1991 ; meiksin et al .",
    "1992 ; bouchet et al .",
    "since these galaxies have weaker two - point correlations than apm galaxies ( and therefore lower @xmath10 values ) , the observational results seem to require these galaxies to be associated with halos identified at late time , or with peaks at low overdensity @xmath64 .",
    "in this paper , we have developed an analytic model for the high - order moments of the distribution of density peaks and dark halos in the quasi - linear regime .",
    "such a model allows the high - order correlation functions of density peaks and dark halos to be calculated analytically for any given initial ( gaussian ) density spectrum .",
    "tests against results from a variety of n - body simulations have shown that our model works successfully for density peaks and for halos identified at an earlier epoch than the time when the moments are calculated .",
    "our model is only qualitatively correct for halos identified at the same time as the moments are calculated , because halos are spatially exclusive at the time of their identification .",
    "we have found that the skewness ( @xmath220 ) , kurtosis ( @xmath221 ) and @xmath224 for both halos and peaks decrease rapidly with the linear bias parameter @xmath10 ( of these objects ) for @xmath12 .",
    "thus if galaxies are associated with peaks in the initial density field , or with dark halos formed at different redshifts , a measurement of @xmath8 ( @xmath1 , 4 , 5 ) of the galaxy distribution in the quasilinear regime should allow us to determine whether or not galaxies are significantly biased relative to the mass .",
    "we have used our model to interpret the observed high order correlation functions of galaxies and clusters .",
    "we have found that if the values of @xmath8 for galaxies are indeed as high as those given by the apm survey , then apm galaxies should not be significantly biased .",
    "there is , however , a significant uncertainty in the comparison between our model predictions and observed galaxy distribution . at",
    "any given time massive dark halos may contain more than one galaxy and galactic - sized peaks in the initial density field may merge with each other to form a single galaxy .",
    "thus the observed galaxies may not correspond uniquely to the centers of the halos present at any single epoch or to galactic - sized peaks in the initial density field . as a result ,",
    "it is not straightforward to apply our results directly to galaxies . however , if more detailed modeling allows a prediction of how galaxies form in dark halos ( e.g. white & frenk 1991 ; kauffmann , nusser & steinmetz 1996 ) , our results can readily be extended to study the high - order moments of galaxy distribution .",
    "such a study will also help us to assess the importance of nongravitational effects in the measurements we are suggesting here .",
