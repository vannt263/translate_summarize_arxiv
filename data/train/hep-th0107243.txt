    "radiative wave propagation in spacetimes containing a black hole has been a subject of investigation for a number of years .",
    "it is well known that after an initial pulse , the waveform undergoes quasinormal ringing outside the black hole .",
    "the frequencies of the `` ring '' are independent of the processes which give rise to these oscillations , and instead are directly connected to the parameters of the black hole .",
    "it is generally believed that these quasinormal frequencies carry a unique fingerprint that leads to direct identification of a black hole , thereby allowing confirmation of their existence through anticipated gravitational wave observation in the near future @xcite .",
    "a great deal of effort has been devoted to the study of the quasinormal modes associated with black holes .",
    "most of these studies were concerned with black holes immersed in an asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "the perturbations of schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrom ( rn ) black holes can be reduced to simple wave equations which have been examined extensively @xciteg - p - p@xcite . however , for nonspherical black holes one has to solve coupled wave equations for the radial part and angular part , respectively . for this reason",
    "the nonspherical case has been studied less thoroughly , although there has recently been progress along these lines @xciteb - o@xcite . in asymptotically flat black hole backgrounds",
    "radiative dynamics always proceeds in the same three stages : initial impulse , quasinormal ringing and inverse power - law relaxation .",
    "increasing interest has been expressed in non - asymptotically flat spacetimes . for a black hole",
    "is immersed in an expanding universe , it has been shown that while the first two stages of radiative dynamics are not affected by the different conditions at infinity , the third one changes brady1@xcite@xcite . at late times",
    "the field decays exponentially , in contrast to an inverse power law as in the asymptotically flat case .",
    "more thorough exploration of the quasinormal modes of scalar fields coupled to the curvature have shown that the field s behaviour strongly depends on the value of the curvature coupling constant .",
    "the first study of the quasinormal ringing for conformally coupled scalar waves in ads space was performed by chan and mann @xcite@xcite .",
    "interest in the asymptotically ads case has since grown considerably , motivated by the recent discovery of the ads / cft correspondence . in this context one",
    "expects that the quasinormal frequencies of ads black holes have a direct interpretation in terms of the dual conformal field theory ( cft ) on the boundary of the asymptotically ads spacetime .",
    "recently , horowitz and hubeney @xcite considered scalar quasinormal modes on the background of schwarzschild ads black holes in four , five and seven dimensions .",
    "they claimed that for large ads black holes both the real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal frequencies scale linearly with the black hole temperature .",
    "however for small ads black holes they found a departure from this behaviour .",
    "this was further confirmed by the object picture obtained in ref .",
    "these investigations were further generalized to reissner - nordstrom ( rn ) ads black holes , which provide a broader parameter space than uncharged schwarzchild ads ( sads ) black holes @xcitewang3 . unlike the sads case",
    ", the quasinormal frequencies do not scale linearly with the black hole temperature , and the approach to thermal equilibrium in the cft was more rapid as the charge on the black hole increased . further extensions in asymptotically ads spacetimes have included investigations of quasinormal modes due to electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations @xcite , and of nonspherical kerr - newmann ads black hole backgrounds @xcite .",
    "so far all investigations on wave dynamics in ads spacetimes have been limited to fields that are either conformally coupled @xcitemann2 or minimally coupled to curvature @xcite . in de sitter",
    "spacetimes the behaviour of the scalar field has considerable dependence on the value of the curvature - coupling constant , and we are likewise motivated to study the dependence of scalar quasinormal modes on the curvature - coupling constant in ads spacetimes , a study we carry out in this paper .",
    "we generalize the study to include topological black holes , whose quasinormal ringing properties have only been examined in the conformally coupled case @xcite .",
    "topological black hole spacetimes are all asymptotically ads spacetimes , and have black hole event horizons which are compact two - surfaces of arbitrary genus @xcite , with genus zero being the sads case .",
    "we solve numerically the wave equations with a general non - minimal coupling of the scalar field to the spacetime curvature .",
    "we find that the number of possible different behaviours of quasinormal modes for scalar field is significantly enhanced as the non - minimal coupling parameter @xmath7 is varied .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we review the basic structures of topological black hole spacetimes and derive the equation governing the scalar test field coupled to curvature . in the next section we analyze behaviours of scalar waves in spherical ( genus @xmath8 ) , toroidal ( @xmath9 ) and higher genus ( @xmath10 ) black hole backgrounds and their dependence on curvature coupling constants .",
