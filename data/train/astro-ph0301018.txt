    "in the past few years there has been tremendous progress in understanding the evolution of cosmic structures on scales from galaxies to about 100 h@xmath1 mpc .",
    "this progress has occurred mainly in two distinct areas : 1 . ) constraining cosmological parameters such as the mass density , dark energy , power spectrum of the initial perturbations of the cosmic mass field , etc . , 2 . )",
    "the modeling of the origin of light - emitting objects to explain the observed mass density profiles , velocity dispersions , mass - to - light ratios , substructures , bias behavior , etc .",
    ", of quasars , galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "these two distinct areas coincide with two different regimes in the context of the dynamics of structure formation .",
    "the first one is based mainly on the evolution of the cosmic mass field in the linear approximation .",
    "the basic statistical tool is the power spectrum , either observed or recovered by gaussianization , of the weakly non - linear field .",
    "the second regime is characterized by the dynamics of collapsed massive halos .",
    "the formation and evolution of luminous clumps can be modeled by the growing and merging of massive halos from initially gaussian perturbations of the mass and velocity fields .",
    "the hierarchical clustering of halos is the most effective scenario for modeling galaxy formation .",
    "however , the clustering behavior of the mass and velocity fields of inter - galactic medium ( igm ) , i.e. , the major component of baryonic matter in the universe , is missing from these two regimes .",
    "it is certain that the igm field is not linear and gaussian because the distributions of qso s ly@xmath0 forests from either observational data or simulation samples ( bi 1993 , bi , ge & fang 1995 ) , have been found to be non - gaussian even on scales as large as a few h@xmath1 mpc ( pando & fang 1996 , 1998a ) .",
    "neither is the evolution of the igm field well modeled by the dynamics of collapsing halos , as the qso s ly@xmath0 forests are generally not gravitationally confined ( fang et al 1996 ) .",
    "the success of modeling the qso s ly@xmath0 forests via a lognormal model of the igm ( bi & davidsen 1997 ) directly indicates that the igm field probably does not ( or has not yet ) undergone a correlation hierarchy evolution",
    ".    the clustering behavior of the igm mass field can play an important role in the dynamical gap between linear power spectrum and collapsed massive halos .",
    "for instance , it has recently been found that the qso ly@xmath0 transmitted flux fluctuations are intermittent ( jamkhedkar , zhan & fang 2000 , feng , pando & fang 2001 , zhan , jamkhedkar & fang 2001 ) .",
    "a field is intermittent if the 2@xmath2 power of the local differences grows faster than the @xmath2 power of the variance of these differences ( see section 2 . )",
    "this result can not be found using the statistical tools of the linear regime such as power spectrum . at the same time",
    ", it is unclear how to incorporate intermittent behavior with the hierarchical clustering scenario .",
    "the intermittent features have also been studied with simulated ly@xmath0 forests produced by a pseudo hydro technique .",
    "all the pseudo hydro samples for low density cold dark matter ( lcdm ) and warm dark matter ( wdm ) models are found to be substantially intermittent .",
    "although the intermittent features of the simulation samples were different from those of the observations ( pando et al 2002 ) , the results implies that intermittency is a common feature of non - linear evolution and is potentially useful for model discrimination .",
    "this motivated us to re - do the intermittent analysis with simulated ly@xmath0 transmitted fluxes produced by a full hydrodynamical treatment .",
    "this motivation was strengthened when we realized that the relation between the igm and dark matter fields in the non - linear regime is treated differently in the pseudo - hydro and full hydro simulations . in the pseudo - hydro simulation ,",
    "the density of the igm in each pixel is assigned according to the dark matter density at that pixel .",
    "that is , the pseudo - hydro simulation assumes that the density distribution of igm traces the underlying dark matter point - by - point on scales larger than the jeans length in either the linear or nonlinear regimes .",
    "this assumption looks reasonable when one considers that the igm is only a passive substance in the cosmic mass field since its evolution is dominated by the gravity of dark matter .",
    "however , hydrodynamic studies have shown that a passive substance in the system does not always behave like the underlying dominant mass field when non - linear evolution has taken place ( for a review , shraiman & siggia 2001 ) .",
    "the statistical properties of a passive substance can _ decouple _ from those of the underlying field .",
    "as we show here , the dynamical equations of the igm within the gravitational field of dark matter are the same as that used for describing the statistical decoupling between the passive substance and underlying field .",
    "therefore , it is possible there is a statistical discrepancy between the igm field and underlying dark matter in nonlinear regime .",
    "the purpose of this paper is then two - fold .",
    "first we study whether the intermittency of the qso ly@xmath0 transmitted flux is matched by the full hydro simulation samples .",
    "secondly we search for possible signs of the statistical discrepancy between the igm field and the underlying dark matter with these samples .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    " 2 presents a brief introduction to intermittent fields and the method to quantify intermittent random fields .",
    " 3 describes the observed samples that we use .",
    " 4 describes full hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the statistical deviation of the igm distribution from the dark matter field is shown in  5 .",
    "a comparison between the model predicted and observed intermittency is performed in  6 .",
    "finally , the conclusions and discussions are presented in  7 .",
    "the dynamical equations for the igm evolution in non - linear regime is given in appendix .",
    "much of this section has been presented in our previous work ( pando et al 2002 ) .",
    "for the paper to be self - contained , we repeat these results briefly .      intermittency is used to characterize a random field with ` spike - gap - spike ' features , i.e. , structures that are essentially strong enhancements randomly and widely scattered in space and/or time , with a low field value between the spikes .",
    "the spike - gap - spike feature is more pronounced on smaller scales .",
    "this feature was originally found in the temperature and velocity distributions in turbulence ( batchelor & townsend 1949 ; frisch 1995 ) .",
    "an intermittent random density field @xmath3 is defined by the asymptotic behavior ( indicated below by @xmath4 ) of the ratio between the high- and low - order moments of the field as ( grtner & molchanov , 1990 ; zeldovich , ruzmaikin , & sokoloff , 1990 ) @xmath5^{2n}\\rangle } { [ \\langle [ \\rho({\\bf x + r})- \\rho({\\bf x})]^2\\rangle]^n } \\asymp\\left \\langle \\frac{r}{l } \\right \\rangle^{\\zeta},\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the size of the sample .",
    "intermittency is measured by the @xmath7- and @xmath8-dependencies of @xmath9  the intermittent exponent .",
    "if the exponent @xmath9 is negative on small scales @xmath8 , the field is intermittent . that is , the ratio in eq .",
    "( 1 ) for an intermittent field diverges as @xmath10 .",
    "this divergence can not be measured by individual higher order correlation functions .",
    "although three- and four - point correlation functions are useful for distinguishing a gaussian from a non - gaussian field , they are insensitive to the difference between an intermittent field and a non - gaussian , but non - intermittent field . to measure intermittency , we define the structure function as @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the average over the ensemble of fields .",
    "if the field is statistically homogeneous , @xmath14 is independent of @xmath15 and depends only on @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath14 is called the structure function .",
    "when @xmath16 , we have @xmath17 @xmath18 is the mean of the square of the density fluctuations at wavenumber @xmath19 , and therefore , @xmath18 is the power spectrum of the field . with the structure function , eq.(1 )",

    "since @xmath25 measures the width of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of @xmath26 , while @xmath14 is sensitive to the tail of the pdf , the ratio eq.(4 ) measures the fraction of density fluctuations in the tail on different scales .    for an intermittent field",
    "the ratio of @xmath14 to @xmath27^n$ ] is larger for smaller @xmath8 and indicates that the field contains `` abnormal '' events of large density fluctuations @xmath26 .",
    "that is , the pdf of @xmath26 is long - tailed .",
    "the long - tail events correspond to a sharp increase or decrease of the density @xmath3 .",
    "they are rare events and yield high peaks or spikes in the distribution of density difference . generally speaking ,",
    "the intermittent exponent @xmath9 measures the smoothness of the field : for positive @xmath9 , the field is smoother on smaller scales .",
    "if @xmath9 is negative , the field is rough on small scales .",
    "the basic quantity used for calculating the intermittent exponent @xmath9 is the density difference @xmath26 .",
    "the exponent @xmath9 does not rely on the mean density @xmath28 and can be measured even if the mass field is fractal , in which case the mean density is no longer available .      in our previous work we presented several examples of intermittency in various kinds of fields . here",

    "a gaussian field is not intermittent .",
    "a self - similar field is also not intermittent .    for a hierarchically clustered field ,",
    "it has been shown ( feng , pando , & fang 2001 ) that @xmath20^n } \\propto \\left(\\frac{r}{l }    \\right ) ^{-(d-\\kappa)(n-1)},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the spatial dimension , and the coefficient @xmath31 is a constant depending on the power law index of the power spectrum . in the case",

    "therefore , a lognormal field is intermittent .    to summarize , the structure function and intermittent exponent provide a complete and unified description of intermittent fields .",
    "the @xmath7- and @xmath8-dependencies of the structure functions and intermittent exponent @xmath9 are sensitive to the details of the intermittency of the field .",
    "these measures are very powerful for distinguishing among fields that are gaussian , self - similar , mono - fractal , multi - fractal , and singular .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 or @xmath41 $ ] contains two variables : the position @xmath15 and the scale @xmath8 , and therefore , @xmath42 , can best be calculated with a space - scale decomposition . among the mathematical tools used to decompose functions in scale space as well as physical space , the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt )",
    "is an excellent choice .",
    "the dwt basis are orthogonal and complete , and therefore , the dwt decomposition does not lose information ( completeness ) , and does not cause false correlations due to redundancy ( non - orthogonality ) .",
    "these two points are essential in studying the higher order statistical features of random fields .",
    "we restrict our discussion to a 1-d random field @xmath43 extending in a physical or redshift spaces @xmath44 .",

    "each subinterval spans a spatial range @xmath48 with the @xmath49 subinterval spanning from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "this operation decomposes the space @xmath6 into cells @xmath52 , where @xmath47 denotes the scale @xmath48 , and @xmath53 the spatial range .",

    "absorption features with @xmath102 km s@xmath1 of this spectrum have been identified .      to study the intermittency of the transmission flux fluctuations",
    ", we should remove the effects of unwanted data , such as 1 . ) bad pixels ( gaps without data ) , 2 . ) metal lines , and 3 . ) negative flux pixels .",
    "the last category generally consists of saturated absorption regions having lower @xmath103 .",
    "although the percentage of low @xmath103 data is not large , it will introduce large uncertainties in the analysis .    the conventional technique for removing unwanted data",
    "is to eliminate the unwanted bins and to smoothly rejoin the rest of the forest spectra .",
    "however , by taking advantage of the localization of wavelets we can use the algorithm of dwt de - noising by thresholding ( donoho 1995 ) as follows    1 .   calculate the sfcs for both the transmission @xmath104 and noise @xmath105 , i.e. @xmath106 2 .   identify unwanted mode @xmath52 using the condition @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a constant .",

    "this is the conditional - counting method to treat the unwanted data ( pando et al . 2002 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the condition ( 19 ) is applied at each scale @xmath47 .",
    "for instance , if the size of a saturated absorption region is @xmath30 , eq.(19 ) requires the removal of all modes @xmath52 on scales less than @xmath30 and located within this region , as these modes have very low s / n ( @xmath109 ) and the local fluctuations in these regions are not reliable",
    ". however , condition ( 19 ) does not require the removal of the saturated absorption region when @xmath30 is less than the scale of modes @xmath52 considered .",
    "if @xmath110 , the mode @xmath52 is counted in the statistics , regardless of whether the mode @xmath52 contains the saturated absorption regions .",
    "the dwt analysis allows an effective application of data containing low s / n regions .",
    "that is , with the scale - by - scale denoising , it eliminates low s / n modes on small scales and in these regions , but keeps their contributions to large scale modes . with this procedure , no eliminating and smoothly rejoining of the data is needed , and therefore , it avoids corrupting long wavelength modes .    with this method",
    ", we can still calculate the structure functions by eq.(17 ) , but the average is not over all modes @xmath53 , but over the un - flagged modes only .",
    "we can also flag modes @xmath52 one by one which are dominated by metal lines .",
    "since the dwt calculation assumes the sample is periodized , this may cause uncertainty at the boundary . to reduce this effect , we drop 3 modes near the boundary , and also flag two modes around a unwanted mode to reduce any boundary effects of the chunks .      to check the quality of the data , we calculate the power spectrum of the transmitted flux fluctuations , @xmath111 , of hs1700 + 6416 . in the dwt representation , this power spectrum is given by ( pando & fang 1998b ; fang & feng 2000 , jamkhedkar , bi , & fang , 2001 ) @xmath112 the first term on the r.h.s . of eq.(20 )",

    ", on scales @xmath130 , or @xmath131 km / s , the power of the fitted flux is lower than the power spectrum .",
    "this discrepancy is probably because the fitted flux is over - suppressed , i.e. , not only noise , but also real fluctuations are suppressed by the fitting procedure .",

    "the dwt power spectra are obtained for each subsection respectively , and the 1-@xmath164 error is estimated from the variance of the 16 sections .",
    "[ for an intermittent field , the error estimation of power spectrum is sensitively dependent on how one treats the intermittency ( jamkhedkar , 2002 ) .",
    "we do not discuss the details of this point here as it will not affect the following discussion . ]",
    "figure 2 shows that simulation samples with the 12 mpc box are in good agreement with observations on all scales @xmath166 h mpc@xmath1 , which corresponds to @xmath167 in fig .",
    "1 . the simulation samples with the 6 h@xmath1mpc box have higher power than observed sample on small scales , but lower power on large scales .",
    "this is expected because the simulation in the 6 h@xmath1mpc box lacks perturbations on scales @xmath168 h mpc@xmath1 and the normalization of the mean flux decrement will lead to the higher power on small scales to compensate for the loss of powers on large scales .    on small scales @xmath169 h mpc@xmath1 ,",
    "the simulated power is significantly lower than the observation data .",
    "this shows again that noise contamination becomes important on scales @xmath169 h mpc@xmath1 , or @xmath170 .",
    "therefore , as in  3.3 , we use the simulation data only on scales @xmath169 h mpc@xmath1 , or @xmath171 , or @xmath132 km / s .",
    "it is well known that in the linear approximation the density contrast of the igm , @xmath172 is equal to that of dark matter @xmath173 on scales larger than the jeans length .",
    "this is true even if initially @xmath174 ( bi , brner & chu 1993 , nusser 2000 , matarrese & mohayee 2002 ) . in other words , the density fluctuations of the igm",
    "trace the dark matter fields point - by - point .",
    "since the clustering of the igm is governed by the gravity of dark matter , the igm can be considered as `` passive substance '' with respect to the underlying dark matter .",
    "thus , the point - by - point relations @xmath175 and @xmath176 on scales larger than the jeans length also looks reasonable in the nonlinear regime . in this case , _ all _ the statistical properties of the igm field on scales larger than the jeans length are the same as the underlying dark matter field .    however , it is known that a passive substance in a hydrodynamic system does not always behave like the underlying dominant mass field when non - linear evolution takes place .",
    "the statistical properties of a passive substance can _ decouple _ from those of the underlying field in the nonlinear regime .",
    "moreover , the evolution of the igm driven by the gravitational field of dark matter is described by a non - linear equation which is essentially the same as that used for modeling the statistical decoupling between a passive substance and its underlying field ( see appendix a. ) hence , we expect to see a statistical discrepancy between @xmath172 and @xmath173 on scales larger than the jeans length .    to determine whether any statistical decoupling has occurred , we begin by assuming that @xmath176 . then wavelet transforming yields @xmath177 , and therefore @xmath178 ^ 2 \\rangle =     \\langle[\\tilde{\\epsilon}^{dm}_{jl}]^2\\rangle.\\ ] ] @xmath179 ^ 2 \\rangle$ ] and @xmath180 ^ 2\\rangle$ ] are , respectively , the dwt power spectrum of the igm and dark matter fields .",
    "therefore , the first conclusion of the point - by - point relation @xmath176 is that the power spectra of the igm and dark matter should be the same .",
    "figure 3 indeed shows that the power spectra of the igm and dark matter fields are about the same .    with eq.(24 ) , it is obvious that the power spectrum of the field @xmath181 should be equal to zero , or considering noise , very small .",

    "this is a sign of the statistical discrepancy between the igm and dark matter mass fields .",
    "we can further make the case by calculating the structure functions for the field @xmath181 .",
    "the result is plotted in fig . 5 and shows that for @xmath194 the ratio of the moments is gaussian , i.e. @xmath195 [ eq.(5 ) ] .",
    "on scales @xmath188 , @xmath196 is significantly larger than a gaussian distributions which strongly indicates of the statistical discrepancy between @xmath172 and @xmath197 is not due to noise . for a given @xmath7",

    "this result is consistent with the dynamical equation ( a14 ) , which requires that the difference @xmath181 generally is an intermittent field .",
    "thus , we conclude again that there is statistical discrepancy from the point - by - point relation @xmath176 .",
    "the statistical discrepancy in the relation between the density fields of neutral hydrogen and dark matter is important as well .",
    "for instance , the pseudo - hydro technique assumes that @xmath198 with @xmath199 ( hui & gnedin , 1997 ) .",

    "this implies that to measure the higher order statistical behavior of an intermittent field , the structure functions are effective and stable . for an intermittent field , the large uncertainty in the power spectrum",

    "figure 11 shows that the relation of @xmath216 for @xmath214 is clearly above the gaussian field , while for fig .",
    "12 it is only marginally different from a gaussian field .",
    "thus , the intermittent behavior on scale @xmath214 probably developed at redshift @xmath218 .",

    "eqs.(29 ) and ( 30 ) show that if the transmitted flux fluctuations are intermittent , the baryonic matter density field and hi field should also be intermittent ( zhan , jamkhedkar , & fang 2001 ) .",
    "figure 17 presents the structure functions for the hi field of the 12 mpc box samples simulation and shows that the hi field is indeed intermittent .",
    "in fact , this field has larger structure functions than the flux fluctuations probably because the transmitted flux can not trace the intermittency of optical depth at heavy absorption regions .",

    "the intermittent behavior of the real data matches the samples produced by full hydrodynamic simulations in the lcdm model .",
    "we have shown that the point - by - point correlation of the igm and hi fields with dark matter field becomes weaker on scales less than about 2 h@xmath1 mpc , which is much larger than the jeans length at the mean density .",
    "although the power spectrum of the igm field is still about the same as that of dark matter at these scales , the mass density field of the igm is no longer point - by - point proportional to the underlying dark matter field .    by using intermittency",
    "we have detected a the dynamical discrepancy between the igm field and the dark matter distribution .",
    "the study of cosmic large scale structure has mainly concentrated on either the two - point correlation function and its scaling , or on the massive collapsed halos of dark matter .",
