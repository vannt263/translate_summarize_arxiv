    "phenomenologically viable models of technicolor can be built that are based on the existence of gauge theories with an infrared fixed point ( irfp )  @xcite .",
    "the latter are asymptotically free theories where the dynamical effects of the fermion determinant induce a non - trivial zero of the beta functions at low energies , leading to scale - invariance at large distances . in particular the existence of a large mass anomalous dimension at the fixed point has been advocated as an important ingredient for model - building .    the phenomenology of strongly - interacting electroweak symmetry breaking has been summarized in several interesting reviews ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for early results , and refs .",
    "@xcite for the more recent developments . ) .",
    "several candidate theories have been singled out by analytical studies based on approximations of the full nonperturbative dynamics . a putative phase diagram which summarizes",
    "nicely the most appealing options was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review of recent results .",
    "these seminal results have triggered a number of numerical studies .",
    "numerical simulations of theories defined on a spacetime lattice are indeed a privileged tool to study the nonperturbative dynamics of these theories from first principles .",
    "current studies have focused on su(2 ) with two adjoint dirac fermions  @xcite , su(3 ) with 8,10,12 fermions in the fundamental representation  @xcite , su(3 ) with two sextet fermions  @xcite , using a variety of methods .",
    "these studies have already revealed an interesting pattern of results about the phase diagram of strongly - interacting gauge theories , which can provide useful comparisons with ( and hence guidance for ) the analytical results .    in this work",
    "we focus on an su(2 ) gauge theory with six flavors of dirac fermions in the fundamental representation , which is supposed to be close to the lower boundary of the conformal window for the su(2 ) color group .",
    "for example , the ladder approximation predicts that the conformal window begins at @xmath2  @xcite , the all - orders beta function conjecture predicts the lower boundary of the conformal window is at @xmath3 , which depends on the fixed point value of @xmath4  @xcite , and metric confinement predicts the conformal window begins at @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "this model is particularly relevant as it may be used for a practical realization of conformal technicolor theories  @xcite .    using the schrdinger functional ( sf ) formulation of the theory  @xcite",
    ", we compute the running coupling and fermion mass as a function of the energy scale in the sf scheme , thereby deriving information on the beta function and the mass anomalous dimension .",
    "we find clear evidence that the running of the coupling is rather slow , and indeed compatible with the existence of a fixed point .",
    "as pointed out in previous studies  @xcite , the identification of a fixed point by numerical techniques is intrinsically difficult : in the vicinity of the fixed point the coupling changes very slowly as a function of the scale ; in order to detect a slow running , and to be able to identify precisely the location of the fixed point , great care must be exercised in taming the systematic errors that arise in numerical simulations .",
    "in particular we need to assess critically the systematic errors that are involved in our actual procedure , and their propagation in the analysis of the lattice data .",
    "contrary to the case of the gauge coupling , the running of the fermion mass does not slow down at the fixed point , and can be more easily identified by numerical methods .",
    "results for the step - scaling function for the scale dependence of the renormalized mass , @xmath6 , yield a bound on the mass anomalous dimension at the fixed point , @xmath7 .",
    "currently the main source of error in the determination of @xmath7 comes from the uncertainty in the value of the gauge coupling at the fixed point .",
    "first results for the anomalous dimension were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the su(2 ) gauge theory with adjoint fermions .",
    "recently new results have been obtained for the su(3 ) gauge theory with sextet fermions in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the method used and the observables considered in this work are the same as the ones we implemented in ref .",
    "they are briefly summarized for completeness in section  [ sec : sf ] , together with the parameters of the runs that have been used for this analysis .",
    "the running of the coupling is encoded in the step scaling function @xmath8 ; our results for the latter are presented and critically discussed in section  [ sec : sfcoupling ] . finally the running of the mass is studied in section  [ sec : sfmass ] ; the data for the mass step scaling function @xmath9 compare favourably with the one - loop perturbative prediction , a feature that we also observed in our study of the su(2 ) gauge theory with adjoint fermions . even though we are unable determine whether a fixed point is present , our data are sufficiently precise to yield an upper bound on the value of the anomalous dimension throughout the range of couplings that we measure .",
    "we measure the running coupling using the schrdinger functional method  @xcite .",
    "we follow the same procedure as in ref .",
    "@xcite except for the change from two flavours of adjoint fermions to six flavours of fundamental fermions . here",
    "we briefly describe the method ; for a full description see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the schrdinger functional coupling is defined on a hypercubic lattice of size @xmath10 .",
    "the boundary conditions are chosen to impose a constant background chromoelectric field , and depend on a parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the coupling constant is then defined as @xmath12 with @xmath13 chosen such that @xmath14 to leading order in perturbation theory .",
    "this gives a non  perturbative definition of the coupling which depends only on @xmath10 and the lattice spacing @xmath15 .",
    "we then remove the lattice spacing dependence by taking the continuum limit .",
    "we determine the mass anomalous dimension @xmath1 from the scale dependence of the pseudoscalar density renormalisation constant @xmath16 .",
    "this is defined as a ratio of correlation functions : @xmath17 as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we use the wilson plaquette gauge action , together with fundamental wilson fermions , and an rhmc algorithm with 4 pseudofermions .",
    "we run at @xmath18 , defined as the value of @xmath19 for which the pcac mass @xmath20 vanishes .",
    "we measure @xmath20 for 5 values of @xmath19 for each @xmath21 on @xmath22 lattices and interpolate to find @xmath18 for each .",
    "we then extrapolate in @xmath23 to determine @xmath18 for the @xmath24 lattices .    in practice",
    "we achieve @xmath25 . at some values of @xmath21 and @xmath10 we have additional results at moderately small masses of @xmath26 , and we observe no mass - dependence within our statistical errors , confirming that any residual finite - mass errors are extremely small .",
    "we have performed two sets of simulations in order to determine @xmath27 and @xmath16 .",
    "we use more values of @xmath10 ( six instead of four ) compared to our previous simulations to improve the quality of the continuum limit extrapolations , and increase the step scaling factor from @xmath28 to @xmath29 to improve the measurement of the slow running of the coupling .    to ensure our results",
    "are not affected by the presence of a bulk transition , we have measured the average plaquette for a range of values of @xmath21 and @xmath19 on @xmath30 lattices with sf boundary conditions .",
    "there is a clear jump in the plaquette at low @xmath21 , suggesting the presence of a bulk transition . however , this disappears around @xmath31 .",
    "since the lowest @xmath21 we use for our measurements of @xmath27 and @xmath16 is @xmath32 , our results should not be affected by this transition .",
    "the parameters of the runs are summarised in table  [ tab : par ] .",
    "the values of @xmath18 are obtained from the pcac relation as described above .",
    ".values of @xmath21 , @xmath10 , @xmath19 used for the determination of @xmath27 and @xmath16 .",
    "the entries in the table are the values of @xmath18 used for each combination of @xmath21 and @xmath10 . [",

    ", we proceed similarly as for @xmath36 .",
    "we first discard the @xmath37 data , and then interpolate quadratically in @xmath23 to find @xmath38 at @xmath39 .",
    "then for each @xmath10 we interpolate in @xmath21 using the functional form  @xcite @xmath40 we choose the smallest @xmath41 which results in an acceptable @xmath42 , as for the @xmath27 fits ; this gives a 5 - 6 parameter fit in each case .",
    "we also use @xmath43 as a next - best fit to estimate the systematic errors from the choice of @xmath41 .",
    "the number of parameters we use for each @xmath44 and the @xmath45 for each fit are shown in tables  [ tab : zpfit1 ] and  [ tab : zpfit2 ] .",
    "we can now calculate @xmath35 using eq .",
    "[ eq : sigmapdef ] and the fits from eq .",
    "[ eq : fitz ] , and finally extrapolate to the continuum limit to obtain @xmath46 .",
    "the errors are smaller than for the running coupling , so we are able to combine both constant and linear continuum extrapolations to control the systematic error from the choice of extrapolation .",
    "we estimate the errors using a multistage bootstrapping procedure .",
    "we plot @xmath6 in figure  [ fig : zpsigboth ] , where the statistical error is in black , and the systematic error arising both from the choice of the number of fit parameters and the continuum extrapolation is in grey .",
    "we also plot the 1-loop perturbative prediction for @xmath6 .",
    "our results are close to the 1-loop prediction , with the running becoming a little faster at strong couplings .    in the vicinity of an irfp , we can define an estimator @xmath47 given by @xmath48 which is equal to the anomalous dimension @xmath1 at the fixed point  @xcite , and deviates away from the fixed point as the anomalous dimension begins to run .",
    "we plot this estimator in figure  [ fig : gamma ] . again",
    "the black error bars show the statistical errors , and the grey the systematic errors .",
    "we see that @xmath47 is small in most of the range of couplings that we measure .",
    "however , it becomes larger at our strongest couplings .",
    "our data is consistent with it reaching values @xmath49 that are interesting for models of technicolor , although our error bars are large and it is also possible that it is as small as @xmath50 , our lower bound at @xmath51 , the smallest coupling at which a fixed point is consistent with our results using a constant continuum extrapolation .",
    "the highest value compatible with our data is @xmath52 at @xmath53 , the highest coupling at which we have results for all @xmath10 .",
    "in this work we have calculated the running of the schrdinger functional coupling @xmath27 and the mass in the continuum limit of @xmath0 lattice gauge theory with six flavours of fundamental fermions , over a wide range of couplings up to @xmath54 .",
    "our results for the running of the coupling have relatively large errors .",
    "this is due to the difficulty of measuring the small difference in the coupling between two nearby scales , a problem that becomes particularly acute as we approach a possible fixed point where the difference falls .",
    "we observe that the running of the coupling is slower than the ( already slow ) one - loop perturbative prediction .",
    "our results using a constant continuum extrapolation are consistent with the presence of a fixed point above @xmath51 , but it is also possible that there is no fixed point in the range of couplings we have measured .",
    "there is an additional uncertainty arising from the choice of continuum extrapolation .",
    "our results for the running of the mass are clearer .",
    "we find the anomalous dimension is small throughout most of the range of couplings we measure , but it becomes larger for our strongest couplings , with a possibility that it reaches values around 1 .",
    "if true , this would be very interesting for technicolor models .",
    "the value of @xmath1 at the fixed point can be predicted using the all - orders beta function conjecture  @xcite .",
    "this gives an exact prediction in terms of group - theoretical factors only .",
    "if the present theory is inside the conformal window , the prediction is @xmath55 , which lies outside the range measured in this study .",
    "unfortunately , given the uncertainty on the existence of the fixed point , any conclusion on the validity of the all - order beta function conjecture is speculative at present .",
    "the accuracy of our results would be improved in particular by using larger lattices , which would give a larger range of @xmath23 for the continuum extrapolations .",
    "this would help to clarify the existence and location of the fixed point , and to reduce the errors on the anomalous dimension .",
    "calculations to improve the statistics and use larger lattice sizes are ongoing .",
