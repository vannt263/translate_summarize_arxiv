    "the fock space representation of the quantum affine algebra @xmath3 was constructed by hayashi @xcite . a combinatorial version of this construction was then used by misra and miwa @xcite to describe kashiwara s crystal basis of the basic representation @xmath4 .",
    "this made it possible to compute the global crystal basis of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "then , it was conjectured that the degree @xmath5 part of the transition matrices giving the coefficients of the global basis on the natural basis of the fock space were @xmath2-analogues of the decomposition matrices of the type @xmath6 hecke algebras @xmath7 at an @xmath8th root of unity @xcite . according to a conjecture of james @xcite",
    ", these should coincide , for @xmath8 prime and large enough , with the decomposition matrices of symmetric groups @xmath9 over a field of characteristic @xmath8 .",
    "the conjecture of @xcite has been proved by ariki @xcite , and by grojnowski @xcite using the results of @xcite .",
    "there is another approach to the calculation of decomposition matrices of type @xmath6 hecke algebras , relying upon soergel s results on tilting modules for quantum groups at roots of unity @xcite .",
    "this approach also leads to @xmath2-analogues of decomposition numbers expressed in terms of kazhdan - lusztig polynomials .",
    "it seems that these @xmath2-analogues are the same as those of @xcite but there is no proof of this coincidence .",
    "in fact , the relationship between the two approaches is still unclear .",
    "the results of @xcite have been applied recently by foda _",
    "_ @xcite to determine which simple @xmath7-modules remain simple after restriction to @xmath10 and to show that this problem is equivalent to the decomposition of a tensor product of level 1 @xmath11-modules .",
    "this provided an explanation for an intriguing correspondence previously observed in @xcite between a class of rsos models and modular representations of symmetric groups .",
    "another description of the @xmath12-fock space , as a deformation of the infinite wedge realization of the fermionic fock space , was obtained by stern @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath2-bosons needed for the decomposition of the fock space into irreducible @xmath12-modules were introduced .",
    "this construction was used in @xcite to give a combinatorial formula for the highest weight vectors , and in @xcite to define a canonical basis of the whole fock space which was conjectured to yield the decomposition matrices of @xmath2-schur algebras at roots of unity . moreover , strong support in favor of this conjecture was obtained by establishing its compatibility with a version of the steinberg tensor product theorem proved by james in this context @xcite .",
    "recently , the theory of perfect crystals @xcite allowed kashiwara _",
    "@xcite to define a general notion of @xmath2-fock space , extending the results of @xcite to several series of affine algebras .",
    "their results apply in particular to the twisted affine algebra of type @xmath0 , which is the case considered in this note .",
    "it has been noticed by nakajima and yamada @xcite that the combinatorics of the basic representation @xmath13 of @xmath0 was similar to the one encountered in the @xmath14-modular representation theory of the spin symmetric groups @xmath15 by morris @xcite as early as 1965 .",
    "this can be explained to a certain extent by observing that the @xmath16-inducing operators of morris and yaseen @xcite coincide with the chevalley lowering operators of the fock space representation of @xmath0 .",
    "this provides a further example of the phenomenon observed in @xcite in the case of symmetric groups and @xmath11-algebras .    in this note , we give the analogues for @xmath17 of the results of @xcite . using the level  1 @xmath2-fock spaces of @xcite , we describe an algorithm for computing the canonical basis of the basic representation @xmath13 , which allows us to prove that this basis is in the @xmath18$]-lattice spanned by the natural basis of the @xmath2-fock space , and that the transition matrices have an upper triangle of zeros ( theorem 4.1 ) .",
    "we conjecture that the specialization @xmath19 gives , up to splitting of rows and columns for pairs of associate characters , and for sufficiently large primes @xmath20 , the decomposition matrices of spin symmetric groups . however , the reduction @xmath19 is more tricky than in the @xmath11 case .",
    "indeed , the @xmath2-fock space of @xmath0 is strictly larger than the classical one , and one has to factor out the null space of a certain quadratic form @xcite to recover the usual description .",
    "the missing ingredient in the spin case when we compare it to @xcite is that , since the spin symmetric groups are not coxeter groups , there is no standard way of associating to them a hecke algebra , and this is an important obstruction for proving our conjecture .",
    "what we can actually prove is that all self - associate projective characters of @xmath15 are linear combinations of characters obtained from smaller groups by a sequence of @xmath21-inductions ( theorem 6.1 ) .",
    "this proof is constructive in the sense that the intermediate basis @xmath22 of our algorithm for the canonical basis , suitably specialized at @xmath19 , is a basis for the space spanned by such characters .",
    "this should have implications on the way of labelling the irreducible modular spin representations of @xmath15 .",
    "up to now , a coherent labelling scheme has been found only for @xmath23 @xcite and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath25 led to formidable difficulties . to overcome this problem",
    ", we propose to use the labels of the crystal graph of @xmath13 , which may contain partitions with repeated parts not arising in the representation theory of @xmath15 , and corresponding to ghost vectors of the @xmath2-fock space at @xmath19 .",

    "hence the vectors of degree @xmath5 of @xmath321 can be identified with linear combinations of self - associate spin characters obtained by a sequence of @xmath319-inductions .",
    "it is known from modular representation theory that the maximal number of linearly independent self - associate projective spin characters of @xmath15 in characteristic @xmath322 is equal to the number of partitions of @xmath5 into odd summands prime to @xmath322 .",
    "therefore the following result follows at once from ( [ char ] ) .",
    "the self - associate projective spin characters of @xmath15 in characteristic @xmath322 are linear combinations of characters obtained by a sequence of @xmath319-inductions .",
    "this was proved by bessenrodt _",
    "et al . _ for @xmath23 @xcite and andrews _ et al . _ for @xmath24 @xcite , but the question remained open for @xmath25 @xcite .",

    "denote by @xmath323 the column vector obtained from @xmath168 by reduction @xmath19 and expansion on the basis @xmath311 .",
    "then , @xmath323 is a projective character by ( [ defa ] ) and @xmath324 is a basis of the @xmath104-vector space of self - associate projective spin characters of @xmath15 in characteristic @xmath322 .    these observations and the results of @xcite",
    "lead us to formulate a conjecture relating the global basis of @xmath13 and the decomposition matrices for spin characters of the groups @xmath15 .",

    "\\(ii ) for @xmath360 , the reduced decomposition matrix of @xmath15 is obtained by postmultiplying the matrix whose columns are @xmath331 by a unitriangular matrix with nonnegative entries .",
    "our conjecture has been checked on the numerical tables computed by morris and yaseen ( @xmath23 ) @xcite and yaseen ( @xmath361 ) @xcite .",
    "thus , for @xmath23 , @xmath362 , the columns of the reduced decomposition matrix are @xmath363",
    "the labels for irreducible modular representations of symmetric groups form a subset of the ordinary labels @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to look for a labelling scheme for irreducible modular spin representations of @xmath15 using a subset of @xmath364 .",
    "this was accomplished for @xmath23 by bessenrodt _",
    "@xcite , who found that the schur regular partitions of @xmath5 form a convenient system of labels .",
    "these are the partitions @xmath78 such that @xmath365 for @xmath366 , and @xmath367 whenever @xmath368 .    in @xcite",
    ", it was also conjectured that for @xmath24 , the labels should be the partitions @xmath78 satisfying the following conditions : ( 1 ) @xmath369 for @xmath370 , ( 2 ) @xmath371 for @xmath372 , ( 3 ) @xmath373 if @xmath374 or if @xmath375 for @xmath372 , and ( 4 ) there are no subsequences of the following types ( for some @xmath376 ) : @xmath377 , @xmath378 , @xmath379 , @xmath380 .",
    "this conjecture turned out to be equivalent to a @xmath2-series identity conjectured long ago by andrews in the context of extensions of the rogers - ramanujan identities , and was eventually proved by andrews _",
    "the authors of @xcite observed however that such a labelling scheme could not be extended to @xmath381 ( see also @xcite ) .    in terms of canonical bases",
    ", the obstruction can be understood as follows .",
    "assuming our conjecture and using the results of @xcite , one can see that for @xmath382 , the labels of @xcite and @xcite are exactly the partitions indexing the lowest nonzero entries in the columns of the matrices @xmath383_{\\lambda,\\mu\\vdash m}$ ] .",
    "for example , in table [ tab1 ] , these are @xmath384 and @xmath385 , which are indeed the schur regular partitions of @xmath386 .",
    "the problem is that for @xmath25 , it can happen that two columns have the same partition indexing the lowest nonzero entry .",
    "for example , with @xmath387 ( @xmath188 ) and @xmath388 , the two canonical basis vectors    @xmath389    and    @xmath390    have the same bottom partition @xmath391 ( compare @xcite , end of section 3 ) .",
    "on the other hand the partitions indexing the highest nonzero entries in the columns of @xmath392 are the labels of the crystal graph ( by theorem [ th](ii ) ) , so that they are necessarily distinct .",
    "therefore , we propose to use the set @xmath393 for labelling the irreducible spin representations of @xmath15 in characteristic @xmath322 . indeed",
    "its definition is equally simple for all @xmath322 .",
    "moreover , because of theorem  [ th](iii ) , this labelling would be compatible with the @xmath322-block structure , which can be read on the @xmath394-cores .",
    "also , it is adapted to the calculation of the vectors @xmath323 which give an approximation to the reduced decomposition matrix .",
    "finally , we note that since @xmath395 provides the right number of labels we have the following partition identity @xmath396 which for @xmath382 is a counterpart to the schur and andrews - bessenrodt - olsson identities .",
    "this happens to be a particular case of a theorem of andrews and olsson @xcite .",
    "namely , one gets ( [ partid ] ) by taking @xmath397 and @xmath398 in theorem  2 of  @xcite .",
    "a combinatorial proof of a refinement of the andrews - olsson partition identity has been given by bessenrodt @xcite .",
    "one can also get a direct proof of ( [ partid ] ) without using representation theory by simply considering the bijections ( [ map ] ) .",
    "we have used the level 1 @xmath2-deformed fock spaces of kashiwara _ et al . _ to compute the canonical basis of the basic representation of @xmath83 , and we have formulated a conjectural relation with the decomposition matrices of the spin symmetric groups in odd characteristic @xmath20 .    as in the case of @xmath11 , it is reasonable to expect that in general , that is when @xmath1 is not required to be a prime , the canonical basis is related to a certain family of hecke algebras at @xmath14th roots of unity",
    ". a good candidate might be the hecke - clifford superalgebra introduced by olshanski @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath399th roots of unity should then be related to the fock space representation of the affine lie algebras of type @xmath400 .",
    "in particular we believe that the fact used by benson @xcite and bessenrodt - olsson @xcite that the 2-modular irreducible characters of @xmath15 can be identified with the 2-modular irreducible characters of @xmath9 corresponds in the realm of affine lie algebras to the isomorphism @xmath401 .",
