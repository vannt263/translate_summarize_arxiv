    "in living systems , the energy released by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphophate ( atp ) is a universal energy source allowing many biological processes such as muscle contraction , active transport or enzyme catalysis .",
    "however , the fundamental question arises whether this energy can be transported from the active sites of the living cell to other regions without being dispersed or dissipated .",
    "this question was first pointed out by davydov and co - workers in the 70th to explain the energy transport in @xmath0-helices @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that the released energy , partially stored in the high - frequency amide - i vibration of a peptide group , can be transported from one end of the helix to the other .",
    "the dipole - dipole coupling between the different peptide groups leads to the delocalization of the internal vibrations and to the formation of vibrons .",
    "however , the interaction between the vibrons and the phonons of the helix induces a nonlinear dynamics which counterbalances the dispersion and yields the creation of the so - called davydov soliton ( for a recent review , see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    unfortunately",
    ", no clear evidence has yet been found for the existence of solitons in real proteins and it has been suggested by brown and co - workers @xcite and by ivic and co - workers @xcite that the solution is rather a small polaron than a soliton .",
    "indeed , this problem exhibits two asymptotic solutions depending on the values taken by three relevant parameters , i.e. the vibron bandwidth , the phonon cutoff frequency and the strength of the vibron phonon coupling . when the vibron bandwidth is greater than the phonon cutoff frequency , the adiabatic limit is reached so that the phonons behave in a classical way and create a quasistatic potential well responsible for the trapping of the vibron according to the davydov soliton . by contrast ,",
    "when the vibron bandwidth is lesser than the phonon cutoff frequency , the situation corresponds to the non - adiabatic limit in which the quantum behavior of the phonons plays a crucial role .",
    "a vibron is thus dressed by a virtual cloud of phonons which yields a lattice distortion essentially located on a single site and which follows instantaneously the vibron .",
    "the vibron dressed by the lattice distortion forms the small polaron and , as mentioned by the authors , this situation corresponds to protein dynamics .",
    "recently , the polaron approach has been improved to characterize the two - polaron energy spectrum with a special emphasis onto the interplay between the dressing effect and the intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide - i vibration @xcite .",
    "both features favor the formation of two - polaron bound states and it has been shown that the helix supports two kinds of bound states referring to the trapping of two polarons onto the same amide - i mode and onto two nearest neighbor amide - i vibrations .",
    "these results were corroborated by a recent experiment devoted to the femtosecond infrared pump - probe spectroscopy of the n - h mode in a stable @xmath0-helix which has revealed the two excited state absorption bands connected to the two kinds of bound states @xcite .",
    "vibrational self - trapping in model helix was thus observed for the first time , validating in the same time the polaron approach .",
    "however , most of the theoretical studies applied to the davydov problem involve a 1d approximation of the 3d structure of the @xmath0-helix .",
    "although a real helix is formed by three spines of hydrogen - bonded peptide units connected through covalent bonds , such an assumption was motivated by the fact that when a vibron is symmetrically excited over the three spines , the vibron - phonon dynamics reduces to that of a single hydrogen bonded chain @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown within the soliton approach , that when a vibron is excited on a single spine the 3d nature of the helix manifests itself by reducing the soliton velocity and by favoring the exchanges between spines @xcite . recently , a detailed analysis of both the soliton trapping and the soliton dynamics in a 3d @xmath0-helix has been done by hennig @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the soliton envelop exhibits a monotonic decay but shows a multihump structure .",
    "in addition , the lattice distortion along hydrogen bonds is reduced for the 3d model when compared with the 1d model , and , in the excited region , the radius of the helix decreases . from a dynamical point of view",
    ", hennig has recovered the soliton velocity decrease and he has shown that the preferred transport pathway takes place along the hydrogen bonds .    in this paper , the small polaron formalism is applied to a 3d model of an @xmath0-helix with a special emphasis onto the modification of the dressing mechanism induced by the 3d nature of the phonons of the helix . we restrict our attention to the characterization of the single - polaron energy spectrum and the generalization to two - polaron eigenstates is addressed in the second paper of this series @xcite .",

    "is introduced in sec .",

    "iii , the nature of the phonons in the helix is first summarized .",
    "then , we first realize a unitary transformation to remove the intramolecular anharmonicity and a lang - firsov @xcite transformation is applied to renormalize the vibron - phonon interaction .",
    "finally , a mean field procedure is performed to obtain the effective dressed vibron hamiltonian . in sec .",
    "iv , a numerical analysis of the vibron - phonon dynamics is performed depending on the values of the relevant parameters of the problem .",
    "finally , the results are discussed and interpreted in sec .",
    "let us consider a sequence of @xmath1 amino acid units ( called residues ) regularly distributed along a polypeptide chain .",
    "let @xmath2 the index which labels the position of the @xmath2th residue along the chain . in three dimension ,",
    "the structure of the polypeptide chain is stabilized by the hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl oxygen ( co ) of residue @xmath2 and the amide hydrogen ( nh ) of residue @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting conformation is a 3d @xmath0-helix in which each residue is related to the next one by a translation of @xmath4   and by a rotation of @xmath5 leading to 3.6 residues per turn of helix ( see fig .",
    "the pitch of the helix , i.e. the product of the translation ( 1.5  ) by the number of residues per turn ( @xmath6 ) , is equal to 5.4  .",

    "each site @xmath2 is occupied by a residue and the dashed line characterizes a particular spine of hydrogen - bonded peptide units .",
    "( b ) top view of the helix backbone where a particular local frame is displayed . ]    to model the vibron - phonon dynamics in a rather simple way , we follow the procedure introduced by hennig @xcite and treat the @xmath1 residues as point - like entities which the equilibrium positions are located on sites distributed along the helix . therefore , as shown in fig .",
    "1a , the geometry of the helix is specified in the ( xyz ) cartesian frame where the @xmath8 direction is parallel to the axis of the helix .",
    "the equilibrium position of the @xmath2th residue is thus expressed as @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the unit vector parallel to the direction @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath2th site contains a amide - i vibration which behaves as an internal high frequency oscillator described by the standard creation and annihilation vibron operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 . by introducing the intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide - i mode , the vibron hamiltonian is written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 stands for the internal frequency of the @xmath2th amide - i mode and where @xmath16 denotes the lateral hopping constant between the residues @xmath2 and @xmath17 . in eq.([eq : hv ] ) ,",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 represent the cubic and quartic anharmonic parameters of each amide - i mode .",
    "note that for the single - vibron dynamics , the intramolecular anharmonicity does not play a crucial role .",
    "as it will be shown in the following of the text , it is responsible for a renormalization of the harmonic parameters ( internal frequency , hopping constants , vibron - phonon coupling ) but it does not fundamentally change the physical behavior of the single - vibron states . nevertheless , it has been introduced here because it drastically affects the two - vibron dynamics , as shown in paper ii @xcite .",
    "the amide - i vibrations interact with the phonons of the helix associated to the collective dynamics of the external motions of the peptide groups . as mentioned by hennig @xcite , both the covalent and the hydrogen bonds",
    "are assumed to be represented by point - point interactions .",
    "the coupling between two residues is thus described by a pair potential @xmath20 $ ] which depends on the instantaneous distance @xmath21 between the two residues @xmath2 and @xmath17 . within the harmonic approximation , each peptide group performs small displacements @xmath22 around its equilibrium position @xmath23 so that the instantaneous position @xmath24 of the @xmath2th residue can be expressed as @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , by expanding the intermolecular potential around the equilibrium helix conformation , the phonon hamiltonian is written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the average mass of each residue and where @xmath28 is the momentum associated to the displacement @xmath22 .",

    "this coupling is expressed in terms of the instantaneous positions @xmath24 of the residues as @xmath34 within the deformation potential approximation , the function @xmath35 can be expanded around the equilibrium position of the residues so that the resulting coupling hamiltonian is finally expressed as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and where @xmath38 denotes the strength of the interaction between the @xmath2th amide - i mode and the external displacement of the @xmath17th residue .",
    "finally , the vibron - phonon dynamics is described by the full hamiltonian @xmath39 which appears as a generalization of the well - known davydov hamiltonian to a 3d @xmath0-helix .",
    "in helices , the vibron - phonon interaction is assumed to be strong enough so that the vibron dynamics is essentially governed by the so - called dressing effect .",
    "the characterization of this effect requires the knowledge of the phonon eigenstates and of the lang - firsov transformation @xcite which yields the small polaron point of view .",
    "however , although these two features are well known in an infinite lattice with translational invariance , the helical nature of the lattice is responsible for a modification of both the phonon structure and the dressing mechanism .",
    "the present section is thus devoted to the presentation of these modifications .      in a recent paper devoted to solitons in an isolated helix chain , christiansen et al .",
    "have introduced a general formalism to characterize the phonon dynamics in an @xmath0-helix @xcite .",
    "this formalism consists in expressing the residue dynamics in a simple way by taking advantage of the invariance of the phonon hamiltonian according to a rotation by an angle of @xmath40 around the helix axis followed by a translation along this axis by a distance @xmath41 @xcite .    to proceed , it is more convenient to express the position of the residues in a set of @xmath1 local frames @xmath42 attached to each residue ( see fig .",
    "the unit vectors of the @xmath2th local frame are expressed in terms of the unit vectors of the cartesian frame @xmath43 as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath11 and where @xmath46 is the local @xmath47 rotational matrix defined as @xmath48 in that context , let @xmath49 denotes the displacement of the @xmath2th residue expressed in the @xmath2th local frame .",
    "this vector is defined in terms of its cartesian counterpart @xmath22 as @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , by applying this latter transformation , the phonon hamiltonian eq.([eq : hp ] ) is rewritten as @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the momentum connected to @xmath53 and where @xmath54 .    at this step ,",
    "it is straightforward to show that the transformed force constant tensor @xmath55 depends only on the index difference @xmath56 ( see appendix a ) . as a consequence , the bloch theorem can be applied so that the displacement of the @xmath2th residue in the @xmath2th local frame can be expanded as a superimposition of plane waves as @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes a reduced wave vector which belongs to the first brillouin zone of the helix , i.e. @xmath59 . the phonon hamiltonian is thus defined in terms of the @xmath60 dynamical matrix @xmath61 as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the momentum associated to @xmath64 .",
    "note that the expression of the dynamical matrix is detailed in appendix a.    finally , the normal mode decomposition is achieved by performing the diagonalization of the dynamical matrix @xmath65 for each @xmath58 value .",
    "such a procedure allows us to define three eigenvalues @xmath66 and three eigenvectors @xmath67 labeled by the index @xmath68 .",

    "similar features are observed for the deformation along the axis of the helix as shown in fig .",
    "7c . indeed , although the central site does not exhibit any distortion , a kink - like soliton takes place . in the left side of the excited side ,",

    "note that the amplitude of the distortion is about 0.02   and appears almost 3.5 times smaller than the deformation which occurs in the corresponding 1d davydov model ( dotted line ) .",
    "in the previous section , the numerical calculations have clearly shown that the 3d nature of the @xmath0-helix strongly modifies the small polaron eigenstates when compared with the 1d davydov model . however , the origin of these modifications is twofold .",
    "first , the vibron dynamics is different because an helix allows for vibron hops between different spines of hydrogen - bonded peptide units .",
    "then , the helix supports both acoustical and optical phonons which participate in a different way to the dressing effect .    nevertheless , to discuss and interpret these observed features , let us first mention some general remarks about the modification of the davydov problem .",
    "indeed , according to the 1d model , the vibron - phonon dynamics along a single spine of hydrogen - bonded peptide units reduces to that of a chain formed by the sites @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath215 ... . in a similar way ,",
    "since a real 3d helix is invariant under a rotation of angle @xmath40 followed by a translation of length @xmath41 , the vibron - phonon dynamics reduces to that of a 1d lattice formed by all the sites @xmath2 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath3 , ... . as the result ,",
    "in a 3d helix , both the vibron and the phonon reduced wave vectors lye in a brillouin zone three times greater than the brillouin zone introduced in the 1d model .",
    "in addition , the vibron - phonon dynamics is now governed by long range interactions .",
    "interactions between nearest and second nearest neighbor sites characterize coupling between different spines of hydrogen - bonded peptide units .",
    "by contrast , interactions between third nearest neighbor sites account for the coupling in a given spine .",
    "these latter couplings correspond to the nearest neighbor interactions in the 1d davydov model .",
    "the analysis of the collective motion of the residues has revealed that the phonon spectrum exhibits an acoustical branch . in the long - wavelength limit",
    ", this branch characterizes the longitudinal sound wave which propagates along the spines of hydrogen - bonded peptide units , as in the 1d davydov model .",
    "however , since the residues are allowed to move in a 3d space , new features occur in a real @xmath0-helix .",
    "first , the spectrum exhibits an optical branch associated to a high frequency breathing motion of the radius of the helix .",
    "more precisely , this radial motion takes place in the long - wavelength limit whereas hybridizations with a torsional motion of the helix backbone occur as when increasing the phonon wave vector . in other words , optical phonons",
    "originate in the covalent bonds between different spines of hydrogen - bonded peptide units .",
    "then , in a marked contrast with the 1d davydov model , the polarization of the acoustic branch strongly depends on the phonon wave vector",
    ". more precisely , a strong hybridization between longitudinal and radial motion takes place when @xmath58 reaches @xmath218 . in that case",
    ", the acoustical branch does not refer to longitudinal sound wave anymore .",
    "in fact , the wave vector @xmath143 plays a key role for acoustical phonons . near @xmath143 ,",
    "the shape of the acoustic branch strongly depends on the geometry of the helix backbone through the value taken by the @xmath171 angle . indeed , when @xmath219 , our calculations have shown that this branch tends to zero ( not drawn in fig .",
    "this surprising feature can be understood as follows . when @xmath220 , it is straightforward to show that the local frames @xmath2 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , ... are equivalent and that all the motions of the corresponding residues are in phase since @xmath223 .",
    "therefore , these motions correspond to a zero frequency uniform translation along the axis of the helix so that the physics is equivalent to that of the 1d model at the center of its own brillouin zone .",
    "when @xmath171 decreases to reach the value characterizing the @xmath0-helix conformation , i.e. @xmath224 , the equivalence between the local frames @xmath2 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , ... is broken . as a result",
    ", in phase motions of the associated residues do not correspond to a uniform translation anymore but are connected to an hybridization between radial and torsional motions .",
    "therefore , a non vanishing frequency occurs in the spectrum .",
    "as mentioned previously , the vibron dynamics in a 3d @xmath0-helix is characterized by two kinds of hopping processes .",
    "the first kind refers to vibrational transition between different spines of hydrogen - bonded peptide units whereas the second kind involves vibron hops along the same spine . in that context",
    ", the nature of the vibron dynamics essentially results from the competition between these two kinds of processes . within the undressed limit ,",
    "i.e. when the vibron - phonon interaction is disregarded , vibron transitions between nearest neighbor and third nearest neighbor sites represent the dominant hopping mechanism since @xmath113 @xmath110 and @xmath112 @xmath110 whereas @xmath114 @xmath110 . in other words ,",
    "the 3d nature of the helix plays a crucial role and the vibron is delocalized between the different spines .",
    "however , our calculations have clearly shown that the dressing effect strongly modifies the value of the effective hopping constants and affects in a different way the two kinds of hopping processes . indeed , at low temperature @xmath225 so that the small polaron behaves almost like the undressed vibron .",
    "this is no longer the case as when the temperature is increased because the two kinds of hopping processes do not experience the same dressing effect .",
    "indeed , the dressing for vibrons hops between different spines is more efficient than the dressing which affects vibron transitions along the same spine . as a result , above a critical temperature @xmath175 becomes the dominant hopping constant . in others words , the dressing effect strongly reduces the vibrational exchange between different spines so that the small polaron tends to propagates almost along a single spine of hydrogen - bonded peptide units .",
    "therefore , at biological temperature , the small polaron dynamics is rather similar to the dynamics described by the standard 1d davydov model .",
    "note that the crossover between the two regimes , i.e. inter - spine and intra - spines vibron hops , is also induced by both an increase of the small polaron binding energy and a modification of the @xmath40 angle which defines the helix backbone geometry . in this latter case ,",
    "when @xmath40 tends to @xmath218 , the vibrational exchanges between different spines vanish and only @xmath175 remains finite ( see fig .",
    "these features essentially originate from the coupling between the vibron and the acoustical phonons of the helix .",
    "indeed , our calculations have revealed that the contribution to the dressing of the optical phonons is rather small , i.e. typically about two orders of magnitude smaller than the contribution of the acoustical phonons .",
    "this effect comes from the fact that the coupling constant @xmath162 is proportional to @xmath226 whereas @xmath161 varies according to @xmath227 .",
    "since @xmath133 is smaller than @xmath129 and @xmath124 is greater than @xmath122 , it is straightforward to show that @xmath228 .    at this step , the role played by the @xmath171 angle as well as the fact that inter - spine or intra - spine vibron hops are subjected to a different dressing suggest that the observed features originate in the singular behavior of the acoustical phonons near the wave vector @xmath143 . indeed , to understand more clearly this effect ,",
    "let us assume an helix conformation with @xmath219 . as mentioned previously , in that case ,",
    "the local frames @xmath2 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , ... are equivalent . when @xmath143 , the residues @xmath2 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , ... move in phase according to a zero frequency uniform translation .",
    "as a consequence , the frequency of the @xmath2th amide - i vibration does not experience any modulation due to the motion of these residues .",
    "by contrast , the coupling constant @xmath229 with residues located in different spines diverges since the phonon frequency is equal to zero .",
    "it results from this behavior around @xmath143 that the hopping constant along a given spine is slightly affected by the dressing effect whereas hopping constants between different spines vanish .",
    "when @xmath171 decreases to @xmath230 , the equivalence between the local frames @xmath2 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , ... is broken .",
    "nevertheless , the motion of the residues along a given spine are more in phase than the motion due to residues located onto different spines . as a consequence ,",
    "the modulation of a particular amide - i vibration due to the motion of residues located on different spines is more important than the modulation produced by residues located in the same spine .",
    "therefore , the dressing effect experienced by a vibron moving along a given spine is always smaller than the dressing effect which affects vibron hops between different spines .",
    "note that the previous results corroborate the calculations performed by hennig @xcite who have shown , within the soliton approach , that the preferred transport path takes place along a given spine whereas inter - spine energy transfer is suppressed .",
    "finally , let us mention that the creation of a vibron in a 3d helix is accompanied by a deformation of the helix backbone different than the distortion which occurs in the 1d davydov model .",
    "indeed , we have shown that the residues located on the spine where the vibron has been excited experience a more intense deformation than the other residues .",
    "this feature originates in the fact that inter - spine covalent bonds are more rigid than intra - spine hydrogen bonds . as a consequence , a distortion propagates more easily along a spine of hydrogen - bonded peptide units than along a covalent bond .",
    "the main consequence is that residues located on the excited spine do not react as residues located on the two other spines so that an asymmetric deformation of the helix backbone occurs . due to this asymmetric behavior , the radial displacement of the residues located on the excited spine exhibits an important decrease whereas the radial displacement of the other residues just slightly increases . in the same way , both the longitudinal and the torsional deformations appear as kink - like solitons characterized by oscillations which account for the fact that the distortion essentially affects the excited spine , only .    in that context",
    ", we basically recover the results obtained by hennig @xcite although our 3d model slightly differs from its cylinder model . indeed , as hennig , we have shown that the longitudinal distortion in a 3d helix is smaller than the distortion occurring in the standard 1d model .",
    "this feature is due to the fact that in a 3d helix inter - spine covalent bonds tend to prevent the deformation of the hydrogen bonds .",
    "in addition , hennig has shown that the helix radius decreases in the excited region according to a deformation two orders of magnitude smaller than the longitudinal distortion .",
    "as explained previously , the helix model we use does not reduce to a cylinder .",
    "therefore , when a vibron is excited on given site , the three spines react in an asymmetric way .",
    "nevertheless , the decrease of the helix radius was obtained , but for the residues belonging to the excited spine , only .",
    "in addition , we have shown that the amplitude of the radial deformation is about the same order of magnitude than the longitudinal distortion . in a marked contrast with hennig who has assumed that the decrease of the radius originates in the optical phonons only , our model suggests that both optical and acoustical phonons strongly affect the radial deformation .",
    "in fact , our calculations have clearly shown that both the radial and the longitudinal distortions are essentially governed by the acoustical phonons so that they have the same order of magnitude .",
    "in the present paper , the vibron dynamics associated to amide - i modes in a 3d @xmath0-helix has been described .",
    "the helix was modeled by three spines of hydrogen - bonded peptide units linked via covalent bonds . to remove the strong coupling between the vibrons and the phonons associated to the external motion of the residues , a lang - firsov transformation was applied and a mean field procedure was performed to obtain the dressed vibron point of view .",
    "it has been shown that the vibron dynamics , due to the 3d nature of the helix , results from the competition between two kinds of hopping processes .",
    "the first kind refers to vibrational transitions between different spines whereas the second kind involves vibron hops along the same spine .",
    "our study has revealed that several parameters such as the temperature , the small polaron binding energy and the helix backbone conformation , allow for a transition between two regimes .",
    "indeed , at low temperature or weak small polaron binding energy , the polaron behaves as an undressed vibron delocalized between the different spines .",
    "by contrast , at biological temperature or strong small polaron binding energy , the dressing effect strongly reduces the vibrational exchanges between different spines so that the polaron tends to propagate along a single spine , only .",
    "the occurrence of these two regimes also depends on the helix backbone geometry via the value of the @xmath171 angle and it has been shown that when @xmath40 tends to @xmath218 inter - spine vibron hops are suppressed .",
    "although the phonon spectrum exhibits both an acoustic branch and an optic branch , it has been shown that the previous features originate in the coupling between the vibrons and the acoustical phonons which exhibit a singular behavior near @xmath143 .",
    "finally , the previous results clearly show that the standard 1d davydov model is a rather good approximation at biological temperature for which the dressing effect drastically reduces inter - spine vibron hops . in that case , for the vibron dynamics , the helix can thus be viewed as formed by three independent spines .    to conclude ,",
    "let us mention that the second paper of this series @xcite is devoted to the generalization of the present work when two vibrons are excited . in that case , both the intramolecular anharmonicity and the strong vibron - phonon coupling act as nonlinear sources which favor the occurrence of specific states called two - vibron bound states .",
    "as shown in paper ii , these states exhibit an experimental signature within nonlinear pump - probe spectroscopy and they are expected to play a key role for energy storage in helices due to their formal resemblance with quantum breathers .",
    "in a general way , the force constant tensor eq.([eq : phi ] ) is expressed as @xmath231\\frac{r_\\alpha(n n')r_\\beta(n n')}{r(n n')^2 } \\nonumber   \\label{eq : phi2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath232 and @xmath233 denote the first and the second derivative of the pair potential between the residues @xmath2 and @xmath17 , respectively .",

    "<S> the vibron dynamics associated to amide - i vibrations in a 3d @xmath0-helix is described according to a generalized davydov model . </S>",
    "<S> the helix is modeled by three spines of hydrogen - bonded peptide units linked via covalent bonds . to remove the intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide - i mode and to renormalized the vibron - phonon coupling , two unitary transformation </S>",
    "<S> have been applied to reach the dressed anharmonic vibron point of view . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the vibron dynamics results from the competition between inter - spine and intra - spine vibron hops and that the two kinds of hopping processes do not experience the same dressing mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , at low temperature ( or weak vibron - phonon coupling ) , the polaron behaves as an undressed vibron delocalized over all the spines whereas at biological temperature ( or strong vibron - phonon coupling ) , the dressing effect strongly reduces the vibrational exchanges between different spines . as a result </S>",
    "<S> the polaron propagates along a single spine as in the 1d davydov model . </S>",
    "<S> although the helix supports both acoustical and optical phonons , this feature originates in the coupling between the vibron and the acoustical phonons , only . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the lattice distortion which accompanies the polaron has been determined and it is shown that residues located on the excited spine are subjected to a stronger deformation than the other residues . </S>"
