    "<S> we study finite size effects in the variance of the displacement of a tagged particle in the stationary state of the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) on a ring of size @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the process involves hard core particles undergoing stochastic driven dynamics on a lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the variance of the displacement of the tagged particle , averaged with respect to an initial stationary ensemble and stochastic evolution , grows linearly with time at both small and very large times . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at intermediate times , it shows oscillations with a well defined size - dependent period . </S>",
    "<S> these oscillations arise from sliding density fluctuations ( sdf ) in the stationary state with respect to the drift of the tagged particle , the density fluctuations being transported through the system by kinematic waves . in the general context of driven diffusive systems , </S>",
    "<S> both the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) and the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) fixed points are unstable with respect to the sdf fixed point , a flow towards which is generated on adding a gradient term to the ew and the kpz time - evolution equation . </S>",
    "<S> we also study tagged particle correlations for a fixed initial configuration , drawn from the stationary ensemble , following earlier work by van beijeren . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the time dependence of this correlation is determined by the dissipation of the density fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that an exactly solvable linearized model captures the essential qualitative features seen in the finite size effects of the tagged particle correlations in the asep . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this linearized model also provides an exact coarse - grained description of two other microscopic models . </S>"
