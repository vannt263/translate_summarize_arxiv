    "in the _ minimal supersymmetric standard model _ ( mssm ) the conservation of a discrete symmetry called @xmath0parity is imposed @xcite .",
    "@xmath0parity is related to the particle spin ( s ) , lepton number ( l ) , and baryon number ( b ) through @xmath5 , being all the standard model particles @xmath0even while their superpartners are @xmath0odd . from this",
    "it follows that supersymmetric particles must be produced only in pairs , with the lightest one being stable .",
    "so far , most searches for supersymmetric particles have assumed conservation of @xmath0parity , however , neither gauge invariance nor supersymmetry ( susy ) require its conservation . in general , we can build models exhibiting @xmath0parity violation which may be explicit @xcite or spontaneous @xcite , or even the residual effect of a more fundamental unified theory @xcite .",
    "one possible scenario for spontaneous @xmath0parity breaking is that it takes place through nonzero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of scalar neutrinos @xcite . in this case",
    "there are two distinct possibilities depending whether lepton number is a gauge symmetry or not .",
    "if lepton number is part of the gauge symmetry there is an additional gauge boson which acquires mass via the higgs mechanism .",
    "therefore , there is no physical goldstone boson and the scale of @xmath0parity violation , in the tev range , also characterizes the new gauge interaction @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we consider the alternative scenario where spontaneous @xmath0parity violation occurs in the absence of an additional gauge symmetry , so that there is a physical massless nambu - goldstone boson , called majoron @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the majoron remains massless and stable in the absence of further explicit @xmath0parity violating terms that might arise , for instance from gravitational effects @xcite .",
    "thus , it will lead to a missing energy signal at high energy accelerators .    in majoron models ,",
    "the neutralino is unstable and for moderate strengths of the @xmath0parity violating interactions , it will decay inside the detector , either via @xmath6 or through majoron emission @xmath7 note this decay mode is r  parity conserving , since the majoron is mainly r - odd ( see ) .    in the first case the neutralino gives",
    "rise to visible signals , except for the 3 @xmath8 decay mode . in the case of the neutralino decay leads to a missing energy signature , exactly as the stable mssm neutralino .    in this work ,",
    "we study the implications of @xmath0parity breaking susy models with a majoron for chargino searches at lep ii . in this case ,",
    "in addition to the conventional mssm chargino decay mode @xmath9 where the @xmath10 can be real or virtual depending on the chargino and neutralino masses , there is a new r  parity conserving two - body decay mode @xmath11 as in the decay in is r  parity conserving it can therefore be quite sizeable .",
    "note that @xmath0parity violating decays @xmath12 and @xmath13 are typically negligible compared to the above decay modes , as shown explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we evaluate the lep ii potential for probing the @xmath0parity violating susy parameter space through the study of new signatures arising from chargino pair production and its corresponding cascade decay .",
    "we determine the limits on the chargino mass ( @xmath14 ) for different values of the @xmath0parity violating interactions . in our analyses ,",
    "we recover the mssm chargino mass limit , which is close to the kinematic limit , for sufficiently small strengths of the @xmath0parity violating interactions .",
    "as the magnitude of @xmath0parity violation becomes larger , new final state topologies become available . by performing a monte carlo analysis",
    "we show that these new topologies also lead to bounds on the chargino mass close to the kinematical limit . assuming unification of the gaugino mass parameters we also determine the corresponding neutralino mass limit .",
    "we adopted the conceptually simplest model for the spontaneous violation of @xmath0 proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in which , by construction , neutrinos are massless before breaking of @xmath0parity . as a result",
    "all @xmath0parity violating observables are directly correlated to the mass of the tau neutrino with the magnitude of this correlation depending upon the choice of the @xmath0parity susy parameters .",
    "apart from the theoretical attractive of giving a dynamical origin for the violation of @xmath0parity and neutrino mass , these models offer the possibility of realizing a radiative scenario for the breaking of @xmath0parity , similar to that of electroweak breaking @xcite .    in order to set up our notation , we first recall some basic ingredients .",
    "the superpotential , which conserves @xmath15 lepton number and @xmath0 , is given by @xmath16 where the couplings @xmath17 are arbitrary matrices in generation space .",
    "the additional chiral superfields @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are singlets under @xmath21 and carry a conserved lepton number assigned as @xmath22 respectively .",
    "note that terms such as @xmath23 and @xmath24 are in principle allowed and have been discussed in earlier papers . for example",
    "a @xmath23 term was included in ref .",
    "@xcite and a @xmath24 has been included in a recent formulation of the theory with radiative symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "however the presence of the @xmath25 field is not essential in the formulation of the theory . in schemes with radiative breaking one",
    "may simply add bare mass terms @xmath26 and @xmath27 without adding the @xmath25 field . from the point of view of our analysis",
    "the presence of @xmath25 has basically no effect , as it relies mainly on the chargino sector .",
    "the superfields @xmath28 @xcite and @xmath25 @xcite are required to drive the spontaneous violation of @xmath0parity in an acceptable way , so that the majoron is mostly a singlet , that is given by the imaginary part of @xcite @xmath29 where the isosinglet vevs @xmath30 and @xmath31 characterizes @xmath0 or lepton number breaking .",
    "the isodoublet vevs @xmath32 are responsible for the breaking of the electroweak symmetry and the generation of fermion masses with the combination @xmath33 being fixed by the @xmath34 masses .",
    "finally , there is a small seed of @xmath0parity breaking in the doublet sector , @xmath35 whose magnitude is now related to the yukawa coupling @xmath36 .",
    "since this vanishes as @xmath37 , we can naturally satisfy the limits originating from stellar energy loss @xcite .",
    "note that , unlike the standard seesaw model , the neutral leptons members of the singlet superfields @xmath19 and @xmath38 are given only dirac - type masses .",
    "notice that we have assumed r  parity violating vevs only for the third generation .",
    "this is the theoretically well - motivated choice if one has in mind a radiatively induced symmetry breaking mechanism @xcite , since the largest yukawa couplings are those of the third generation . for future use",
    "we define an effective parameter @xmath39 , which measures the violation of @xmath0parity now expressed as an effective bilinear superpotential term which breaks r  parity explicitly . together with the standard mssm @xmath40 parameter it will affect the fermion mass matrices given below .",
    "the form of the chargino mass matrix is common to a wide class of @xmath21 susy models with spontaneously broken @xmath0parity and is given by @xmath41 two matrices u and v are needed to diagonalise the @xmath42 ( non - symmetric ) chargino mass matrix @xmath43 where the indices @xmath44 and @xmath45 run from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 ) .",
    "if the singlet superfield mass terms are large one can truncate the neutralino mass matrix so as to obtain an effective @xmath50 matrix of the following form @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 denote the supersymmetry breaking gaugino mass parameters and @xmath53 are the @xmath21 gauge couplings divided by @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , we assumed the canonical gut relation @xmath55 .",
    "we have however included the full neutral mass matrix , including the singlet sector , and diagonalized it numerically in order to determine , for example , the mass and to identify the physical mass eigenstates . in any case",
    "the singlets are hardly relevant for our present analysis , as they appear in the chargino mass matrix only through the effective bilinear parameters@xmath39 , which measures the violation of @xmath0parity and the usual mssm @xmath40 parameter .    the matrix ( [ nino ] )",

    "no essential change would result if lower @xmath64 values were included . in the analysis of the signals",
    "we have simply fixed @xmath62 at the two illustrative values used by the delphi collaboration .",
    "as we can see from the neutralino and chargino mass matrices , the @xmath1 parameter gives the main contribution to the mixing between charged ( neutral ) leptons and the charginos ( neutralinos ) and also leads to @xmath0 violating gauge couplings .",
    "we have required the parameters @xmath66 and the expectation values lie in the ranges @xmath67 -24pt @xmath68 for definiteness we have set @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the above range for the @xmath0parity breaking parameters is quite reasonable and generous , and has been used widely in previous papers e.g. @xcite .",
    "there are many restrictions on the parameters in broken @xmath0 models which follow from laboratory experiments related to neutrino physics , weak interactions , cosmology , and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "the most relevant constraints come from neutrino - less double beta decay and neutrino oscillation searches , direct searches for anomalous peaks at @xmath71 and k meson decays , the limit on the tau neutrino mass @xcite , and cosmological limits on the @xmath72 lifetime and mass , as well as limits on muon and tau lifetimes , on lepton flavour violating decays , and universality violation .",
    "these constraints have been taken into account in several previous papers @xcite .",
    "here we have just included an updated version .",
    "the model described above constitutes a very useful way to parametrise the physics of @xmath0 violation , due to the strict correlation between the magnitude of @xmath0 violating phenomena and the resulting @xmath72 mass . in other words , neutrinos are strictly massless before breaking @xmath0 , therefore all @xmath0 violating observables , such as the lightest neutralino decay rate @xmath73 , are directly correlated to the mass of the tau neutrino . in fact , the @xmath74 neutrino mass may be written schematically as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is some effective parameter given as a function of @xmath60 , @xmath40 , @xmath64 , etc .",
    "this establishes a correlation between the violation of @xmath0 and the @xmath72 mass showing explicitly how the broken @xmath0-model provides an interesting mechanism to understand the origin of neutrino mass without invoking physics at very high energy scales @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mntau_eps ] , we exhibit the tau neutrino mass as a function of @xmath1 , showing in light grey the region in the ( @xmath77,@xmath1 ) plane which is compatible with the tau neutrino mass limit from lep .",
    "we also present in this figure the region in which the charginos can be pair produced at lep , which corresponds to a smaller range of @xmath1 values ( dark zone ) .",
    "as we can see , for @xmath78 , the maximum value of @xmath1 that can be probed through chargino pair production at lep ii is around @xmath79 gev and it increases for larger @xmath64 .",
    "for definiteness we fixed the value of @xmath1 in our analysis .    in the following section we describe the most relevant chargino and neutralino decay modes for this work .",
    "a complete list of the decay widths and couplings can be found in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "at lep ii the lightest chargino may be pair produced via @xmath80 in this work we assumed that the sneutrinos are so heavy that only the @xmath81 and @xmath82 s - channels contribute to the cross section ; see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact , the contribution of the t - channel to the total cross section is completely negligible for sneutrinos heavier than 500 gev .",
    "[ fig : xs ] shows a scatter plot of the allowed values of the @xmath83 total cross section versus the chargino mass for @xmath84 gev , when the parameters are varied as in and .",
    "as one can see , this cross section varies between 2 and 10 pb for almost all kinematically allowed chargino masses .",
    "although , our model allows the single @xmath0parity - violating chargino production @xmath85 we only considered in this paper the pair - production of charginos , as in the mssm , since the cross section for the single chargino production at lep ii is too small to be observed @xcite .",
    "the breaking of @xmath0parity not only opens new decay channels for the chargino but also allows the lightest neutralino to decay .",
    "therefore , there are new signatures for susy , some of them being very striking . in order to simplify the analysis",
    ", we assumed that all sfermions are sufficiently heavy not to influence the physics at lep ii , _",
    "i.e. _ we neglected their effects in the chargino production as well as in their decays . in the present model , the lightest neutralino ( @xmath86 )",
    "can decay invisibly @xmath87 , as in , as well as into @xmath0parity violating channels @xmath88 for the chargino masses accessible at lep ii , the above @xmath10 and @xmath82 are off - shell and the neutralino has only two - body majoron decays and the above three - body modes .",
    "a complete description of neutralino decay modes as a function of the model parameters and masses can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice that all three - body decay channels of the lightest neutralino are _ visible _ , except for the neutral current one leading to 3 neutrinos . in the parameter space regions where most of neutralino decays are _ visible _",
    ", the strategies to search for susy particles are considerably modified with respect to ones used in the mssm .",
    "the mssm is recovered as a special limit of this class of models , when the lightest neutralino decays outside the detector because @xmath0parity violation is not strong enough .",
    "notwithstanding , @xmath86 decays can also lead to missing momentum due to the presence of neutrinos or majorons .",
    "it is important to notice that , the neutralino of a spontaneously broken @xmath0parity model fakes the mssm one when the invisible decay given in eq .",
    "( [ inv ] ) dominates since its decay products escape undetected .    in @xmath0parity",
    "breaking models , the decays of the lightest chargino , denoted by @xmath4 , are modified by the existence of new channels . in models with a majoron",
    ", the lightest chargino ( @xmath4 ) exhibits the two - body decay mode @xmath89 of , in addition to the channels , which conserves @xmath0parity .",
    "however , for the parameter range considered , the second lightest neutralino mass is around the chargino mass , so that this decay is forbidden or kinematically suppressed . ]",
    "@xmath90 where we again assumed that the sfermions are heavy . in the framework of the mssm",
    "only the last decay channel is present , however , with the @xmath86 being stable .",
    "therefore , the breaking of @xmath0parity can modify substantially the signature of charginos .    for the sake of illustration we exhibit in fig .  [",
    "fig : br ] typical values of the branching ratios of charginos and neutralinos , when we vary @xmath1 for @xmath91 gev , @xmath92 gev , and @xmath93 .",
    "for neutralinos we exhibit its total visible and invisible branching ratios , where we included in the invisible width the contributions coming from the neutrino plus majoron channel ( @xmath94j ) , as well as from the neutral current channel when the @xmath82 decays into a pair of neutrinos ( @xmath95 ) .    for small @xmath96 values ( up to @xmath97 gev ) the neutralino will decay outside the detector ( since its lifetime is larger than @xmath98 s ) so that it leaves no visible track .",
    "in this case it is effectively stable and the mssm limit is restored . in this region the invisible component of the neutralino decay is associated only to the @xmath95 channel .",
    "when the @xmath1 parameter grows up to the order of @xmath46 gev the decay channels get mixed and both neutralinos as well as charginos have @xmath0parity violating decays at the same level as the standard mssm ones . as expected , above @xmath99 gev or so @xmath4 and @xmath86 decay predominantly into majorons , that is , the invisible channel dominates the decay of the neutralino and the main chargino decay mode is @xmath100 .",
    "at lep ii , there is a variety of topologies associated to the production of lightest chargino pairs .",
    "we classified the possible signatures into four categories which contain almost all the final states allowed in @xmath0parity violating models .    * _ mssm topologies : _ this class includes the following topologies @xmath101 where @xmath102 stands for @xmath103 or @xmath104 .",
    "these are the channels used in the chargino searches within the framework of the mssm . in majoron models ,",
    "such topologies are obtained by charged - current decays into @xmath105 or @xmath106 , with the @xmath86 decaying invisibly . as we can see from fig.[fig : br ] , these topologies are expected to be important for very small values of @xmath1 since this is the region where @xmath4 decays predominantly into @xmath107 and the neutralino has such a long life - time and it is not observed in the detector .",
    "these topologies also play an important rle for moderate values of @xmath1 ( e.g. @xmath108 ) where the invisible decay of the neutralino is dominant and the chargino still decays into a @xmath106 . * _ multi - fermion ( exotic ) topologies : _ when the neutralino decays visibly , almost all the three - body channels of the chargino lead to at least 3 charged leptons or jets .",
    "again , this occurs for small values of @xmath1 , where the chargino decays predominantly into @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , the pair production of charginos can give rise to events with a large multiplicity of leptons and/or jets in this region of the parameter space .",
    "this is a striking signature of new physics .",
    "we focussed our attention on final states with 5 or more charged leptons and/or jets that also present missing energy .",
    "* @xmath109 with 2 jets topology : for moderate values of @xmath1 the neutralino decays invisibly and the chargino either into @xmath110 or into @xmath106 .",
    "an important topology to analyze for this range of parameters is @xmath111 which arises when one of the charginos decays to @xmath110 while the other one decays to @xmath106 .",
    "* @xmath112 : for large values of @xmath1 , the chargino decay is dominated by @xmath113 , therefore , the signal arising from its pair production is @xmath114 in this case the signal for charginos in majoron models is the same of stau production in the mssm framework @xcite .      our goal is to evaluate the potential of lep ii to unravel the existence of supersymmetry with spontaneous @xmath0parity violation . in order to do so , we studied the signals and backgrounds , choosing the cuts to enhance the former .",
    "the main background for the above topologies are :    * _ mssm topologies : _ the background for these signals has been studied at length by several groups , including the experimental collaborations @xcite .",
    "the main sources of background for these topologies are @xmath115 ( @xmath116 or @xmath102 ) , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "the total cross sections of the backgrounds and respective cuts for the three mssm topologies , after the cuts imposed by delphi in their analysis , are given in @xcite .",
    "moreover , we can easily obtain the signal cross sections in models with @xmath0parity violation by evaluating the cross section for chargino pair production and multiplying it by the appropriate branching ratios and experimental detection efficiencies  that is , we basically re - scale the delphi analysis to our scenario .",
    "these efficiencies are a function of the mass difference between the chargino and the lightest neutralino , with a small fluctuation due to the the statistical error in the simulation as well as an intrinsic dependence on the chargino mass . to be conservative , we have considered the lowest value of these efficiencies for each mass difference . * _ multi - fermion ( exotic ) topologies : _ at the parton level , these events exhibit 5 or more fermions .",
    "for instance , we can have final states @xmath121 , or six charged leptons and missing @xmath122 , or 8 jets and missing @xmath122 . the standard model ( sm )",
    "contributions to these events originate only from higher orders in perturbation theory , and consequently they have negligible cross sections . in our analysis , we assumed that there is no sm background and a conservative detection efficiency of @xmath123% .",
    "* @xmath109 plus 2 jets topology : the sm processes that can give rise to this topology are @xmath124 , @xmath125 , which also contribute to the @xmath126 mssm topology background . at the parton level",
    "the cross sections of these process are the same for @xmath127 , @xmath104 , or @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , we evaluated the size of this background by multiplying the delphi s result for @xmath128 by a @xmath74 identification efficiency , which we have taken as 80% .",
    "* @xmath129 : this is the main signal of @xmath0parity violation models over a large @xmath1 range .",
    "it happens to be the same signal which would arise from the pair - production of staus in the mssm framework .",
    "we have constructed an event generator to simulate the pair - production of charginos as well as their decays within the framework of @xmath0parity violating models .",
    "the sm backgrounds were studied using the event generator pythia @xcite .",
    "we considered the following sm processes , taking into account the qed ( qcd ) initial and final state radiation , as well as fragmentation and @xmath74 decay : @xmath130 \\gamma\\gamma & \\to   \\ell^+ \\ell^- { { { \\rm p } \\hspace{-0.525 em } \\raisebox{-0.27 ex } { /}_{\\text{\\small t } } } } \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to reduce these backgrounds , we applied a series of cuts similar to the ones used by delphi and alephi for the stau search @xcite .",
    "initially we kept only the events presenting `` two jets '' , which might be leptons , with a visible mass larger than 6 gev .",
    "we also vetoed events exhibiting photons with more than 4 gev whose angle with each jet is greater than 10@xmath131 and whose invariant mass with the jets is greater than 2 gev .",
    "the two - photon background is eliminated efficiently by requiring the missing transverse momentum to be larger than 6% of the center - of - mass energy in events with a visible mass smaller than 30 gev .",
    "we also imposed that the polar angle of the missing momentum lies between @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "a very useful variable is defined by the following procedure @xcite : first , we projected the jet momenta into the plane perpendicular to the beam axis .",
    "then we evaluated the thrust from the projected momenta , and defined @xmath134 as the scalar sum of the transverse components of the projected momenta with respect to this thrust axis .",
    "we also defined the acoplanarity @xmath135 as the angle in the plane perpendicular to the beam between the 2 jets . with these quantities",
    "we can reduce considerably the fermion pair background ( @xmath136 ) by rejecting the events that lead to @xmath137 .",
    "this cut eliminates a large fraction of the fermion pair events since these tend to exhibit back - to - back jets with a rather small @xmath134 .",
    "the @xmath138 background is similar to the signal .",
    "however , we can discard a large fraction of the @xmath139 or @xmath140 events remembering that the @xmath103 or @xmath104 originating from @xmath10 s are more energetic than the ones coming from @xmath109 decays .",
    "this is accomplished by requiring the largest lepton momentum to be smaller than 22 gev .",
    "if both @xmath10 s decay leptonically , we also demanded the second lepton to have a momentum smaller than 15 gev .",
    "after applying the above cuts and for center - of - mass energy of 172 gev , the @xmath141 background is completely eliminated . on the other hand , the cross section for fermion pair production is reduced to 13 fb , while the @xmath142 background has a cross section of 4 fb . most of the background events originate from @xmath138 pairs whose cross section is 60 fb .",
    "nevertheless , the signal possesses an efficiency of 3040% depending on the chargino mass .",
    "for the sake of definiteness we considered a center - of - mass energy of 172 gev and a total integrated luminosity of 300 pb@xmath143 , according to lep ii design expectations @xcite . however , our results should be a conservative estimate of the lep ii potentiality even for actual energies and luminosities . in analogy to the usual analyses performed for the mssm , we present the 95% cl excluded regions of the @xmath144 susy parameter space for different values of @xmath64 and @xmath1 , assuming that the number of observed events is equal to the expected one for the background @xcite .",
    "first of all , we obtained bounds for @xmath145 , which should reproduce the mssm results .",
    "we show in fig.[fig : zone2 - 0 ] that we indeed obtain exactly the same limits found in the mssm analyses @xcite , for both @xmath146 and 35 .",
    "this shows that we are consistent .    for relatively small values of the @xmath0parity violation parameter",
    "@xmath1 the most important topologies are the mssm and the exotic multi - fermion ( @xmath109 plus 2 jets ) one for small ( large ) values of @xmath64 .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : zone2 - 0.1 ] , for @xmath147 gev and @xmath146 , that the main constraints still come from the mssm final states while the exotic multi - fermion channels are irrelevant to the final limits .",

    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : zone35 - 0.1 ] the 95% cl excluded regions in the plane @xmath149 for @xmath150 gev and @xmath151 , which clearly shows that the mssm and @xmath109 plus 2 jets topologies lead to similar bounds .    for larger values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the neutralino decays mostly invisibly while the chargino presents a sizeable @xmath152 branching ratio ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : br ] .",

    "in fact , fig .  [",
    "fig : zone2 - 1 ] shows for @xmath155 and @xmath156 gev that the most important channel for these parameters is @xmath157 in a large fraction of the parameter space .",
    "however , for this value of @xmath62 , the mssm final states still lead to important bounds for small values of @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , for larger values of @xmath64 the @xmath157 mode dominates in all points in susy parameter space ; see fig.[fig : zone35 - 1 ] .    finally , for @xmath158 and @xmath159 gev , only the channels involving chargino to tau ",
    "majoron play a significant rle , and consequently the mssm topologies can not give any information .",

    "lep ii is also able to probe chargino masses almost up to the kinematical limit despite the presence of the irreducible @xmath138 background ; see section [ smb ] .",
    "furthermore , for such a large value of @xmath1 and smaller values of @xmath64 , the chargino masses compatible with the limits on the @xmath72 mass are not accessible at lep ii energies , as can be seen in fig .",
