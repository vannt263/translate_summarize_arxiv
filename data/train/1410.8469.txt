    "<S> the observed features agree with the expectations of the theoretical picture presented above and demonstrate that both temperature and applied current provide additional means of manipulating the trapped vortex . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of @xmath23 is contained in the @xmath60 term . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the applied current is uniformly distributed within the loop , an additional lorentz force on the vortex is expected , resulting in the addition of a linear term to the @xmath23 curves in figure  [ vinvsv ] . </S>",
    "<S> numerical solutions for @xmath22 as a function of applied current and temperature are shown in figures  [ toggle]c - d for the square loop . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath61 should be an even function for our system , since in our measurement geometry , current counter propagates in both arms , but in figure  [ toggle]c , we consider @xmath22 in only one arm due to an experimentally observed asymmetry between the arms ( see appendix  [ app - asymmetry ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuities in the calculated @xmath62 curves can be understood by considering the energy difference between the n and n+1 states at a given applied field . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath63 is periodic in @xmath18 ( eq .  [ kogan_f0 ] ) and maximal just above half - integer values of @xmath43 ( indicated by dashed lines in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ toggle]c - d ) . </S>",
    "<S> going from a vortex - free to vortex - trapped state is similar to increasing the winding number from @xmath17 to @xmath64 , and is therefore most energetically costly where @xmath63 is maximal . </S>",
    "<S> our measured @xmath65 curves appear to be consistent with a jump in @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed resistance peaks are sufficiently sharp so that both the non - shifted and shifted @xmath51 peaks would be seen at intermediate currents if the critical field for vortex stability evolves smoothly . given that only one or the other is found experimentally , and that the additional local resistance maximum jumps discontinuously between the 0.6 and 0.7  @xmath54a curves , at least a rapid decrease in @xmath22 from @xmath66 to @xmath67 is present as @xmath57 increases , if not an actual discontinuity .    </S>",
    "<S> the manipulation of both vortex crossing and trapping in a mesoscopic loop demonstrated in the present work lays a foundation for further investigations into vortex motion in mesoscopic samples . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if the trapped vortices behave as complex quantum mechanical particles , this system may possess macroscopic quantum coherence and form macroscopic energy levels , which can then be measured by radio or microwave measurements@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if the trapped vortex can perform coherent quantum motion , detection of the aharonov - casher interference of abrikosov vortices may be attempted@xcite . from a technological perspective </S>",
