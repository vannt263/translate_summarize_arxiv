    "abrupt shifts in star formation efficiency and gas richness near @xmath9 have been linked to the interplay of gas infall , supernova - driven winds , and changes in surface mass density @xcite .",
    "the buildup of the red sequence above @xmath7 has been linked to `` quenching '' processes that shut down star formation , such as gas loss caused by agn feedback , consumption of all available gas in the wake of violent merging , ram - pressure stripping / harassment / strangulation in clusters , and/or shock - heating that turns off efficient `` cold - mode '' gas accretion @xcite .",
    "some combination of these processes may be required to ensure that quenching is efficient , permanent , and mass - dependent @xcite .",

    "the likelihood of intermittent growth and/or dust - enshrouded star formation implies that some former or future blue - sequence e / s0s should fall on the red sequence .",
    "consistent with this picture , we find regimes of overlap in red - and blue - sequence e / s0 properties ( gas fractions , radii , velocity dispersions ) , with substantial diversity among red - sequence e / s0s . with existing data , we can not measure rotation velocities for the dynamically cold red- and blue - sequence e / s0s in our sample (   [ sec : scaling ] ) , but many have stellar masses sufficient to join the spiral - galaxy tully - fisher relation above @xmath9 ( i.e. , above @xmath120 @xmath4 120 ) , provided they grow large rotating disks ( fig .  [ fg : masssigma ] ) .",
    "one such blue - sequence s0 , ugc12265n , has enough gas to double its stellar mass and is engaged in a strong interaction with a smaller but substantial companion , driving stellar mass growth at a rate of @xmath420% per gyr (   [ sec : cgsf ] ) . because the eventual merger should be too gas rich to destroy the disk @xcite , this galaxy will almost certainly develop spiral structure as the disk forms stars and responds to tidal forces in the interaction .",
    "such an event may mark the birth of a large spiral galaxy .",
    "most of the above discussion refers to a snapshot at @xmath15 .",
    "given the downsizing of the bimodality mass , e.g. , as seen in the downsizing of the crossover mass for e / s0 and late - type mass functions from close to @xmath3 at @xmath121 to @xmath4@xmath7 today @xcite , we suspect that the gas - richness threshold mass @xmath9 has also evolved from @xmath26 .",

    "consistent with this expectation , @xcite report from the cosmos survey that the number density of large disks with bulges has doubled since @xmath121 , whereas they see no increase , and possibly a small decrease , in the number density of bulgeless disks at @xmath15 .",
    "these results point to the importance of forming bulges before building large disks , i.e. , merging gas - rich bulgeless late types to form e / s0s may be an enabling step in large disk galaxy formation ( as also suggested by the star formation efficiency considerations in   [ sec : disks ] ) .",
