    "in this result , we develop the dipsersive estimates used to prove stability of solitons for a focusing , saturated nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) in @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 for all @xmath10 , @xmath11 has a specific structure outlined in the following definitions :    [ def : non1 ] saturated nonlinearities of type @xmath12 are of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "[ def : non2 ] saturated nonlinearities of type @xmath19 are of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 .    in both cases , for @xmath23 large ,",
    "the behavior is @xmath24 subcritical and for @xmath23 small , the behavior is @xmath24 supercritical . for definition [ def : non1 ] , @xmath25 is chosen much larger than the @xmath24 critical exponent , @xmath26 in order to allow sufficient regularity when linearizing the equation .    in the sequel",
    ", we assume that @xmath27 and @xmath28 , or in other words , @xmath29 has finite variance . for this initial data , from the spatial and phase invariance of nls , we have many the following conserved quantities :    conservation of mass ( or charge ) : @xmath30    and    conservation of energy : @xmath31 where @xmath32    we also have the pseudoconformal conservation law : @xmath33 where @xmath34 note that @xmath35 is the hamilton flow of the linear schrdinger equation , so the above identity relates how the solution to the nonlinear equation is effected by the linear flow .    detailed proofs of these conservation laws can be arrived at easily using energy estimates or noether s theorem , which relates conservation laws to symmetries of an equation .",
    "global well - posedness in @xmath24 of ( nls ) with @xmath11 of type @xmath12 or @xmath19 for finite variance initial data follows from standard theory for @xmath24 subcritical monomial nonlinearities .",

    "a soliton solution is of the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a positive , radially symmetric , exponentially decaying solution of the equation : @xmath39 with this type of nonlinearity , soliton solutions exist and are known to be unique .",

    "an important fact is that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are differentiable with respect to @xmath44 .",

    "variational techniques developed in @xcite and @xcite tell us that when @xmath52 is convex , or @xmath53 , we are guaranteed stability under small perturbations , while for @xmath54 we are guaranteed that the soliton is unstable under small perturbations . for brief reference on this subject ,",

    "however , from the scattering theory point of view taken in @xcite , we are able to define the orthogonality condition in order to generalize the results and more easily prove the weighted estimates .",

    "one could perturb onto the manifold of stable solitons , onto the manifold of unstable solitons , or in fact , reduce the @xmath24 energy so that solitons no longer formed . unfortunately ,",
    "due to a lack of scaling and general difficulties , very little is known about stable perturbations to such a soliton . also , it is a major question whether or not we have dispersion and scattering for initial data with @xmath24 mass below the minimal soliton mass .",
