    "production of three pions in proton - proton interactions , where the pions do not originate from decays of narrow meson resonances ( like @xmath3 or @xmath6 ) , has not received proper attention yet , neither experimentally nor theoretically .",
    "experimentally there are only very few data on the  and  reactions and no data on the other reaction channels : , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . on the theory side there",
    "exists a complete microscopic model covering all reaction channels of two pion production in p@xmath9 interactions @xcite , but so far no such models have been developed for the three pion case . in the isobar model the process   should proceed by an excitation of one or two baryon resonances followed by the subsequent decays @xcite and in the low energy region a mechanism with a simultaneous excitation of @xmath10 and @xmath11 resonances is expected to dominate .",
    "the @xmath10 involved has to decay into @xmath12 and therefore the lowest lying roper ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 resonances could be considered .",
    "there is however a significant difference between their decay pattern .",
    "the roper decays predominantly into @xmath15 whereas for the @xmath16 the @xmath17 channel is equally important @xcite .",
    "the influence of the resonances in the intermediate state can be studied in the invariant mass distributions of the subsystems of the outgoing protons and pions .",
    "such studies were done for the and   reactions in bubble chamber experiments performed at higher energies ( beam kinetic energies of 4.15 gev and 9.11 gev ) with up to thousand events @xcite . in these studies , only one or two of the pions were considered to originate from decays of @xmath10 or @xmath18 resonances . however , such kind of analysis is complicated and may not be conclusive due to many possible scenarios and due to large widths of the involved resonances .",
    "a simple starting point for analyzing the three pion production close to threshold is to assume a constant value for the matrix element .",
    "the dependence of the cross section on the beam energy is then given by the phase space volume divided by a flux factor .",
    "for a proper description of the reactions in the threshold region it is required to take into account the final state interaction ( fsi ) between the outgoing protons @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 fsi on the other hand is expected to be negligibly small @xcite .",
    "a hint about the production mechanism of the three pions could then be obtained by studying the ratio of the cross sections for the different charge states .",
    "the three pion production amplitude @xmath20 can be written in terms of the isospin amplitudes @xmath21 , where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) denotes the initial ( final ) isospin of the nucleon pair and @xmath24 denotes the isospin of the produced pion triplet .",
    "it is now straightforward to show that @xmath25 where cross terms between @xmath26 and @xmath27 amplitudes are neglected . in the simple statistical approach @xcite , with all amplitudes @xmath21 put equal , one obtains @xmath28 .",
    "there were so far experimental data on @xmath29 only . at 2.0 gev",
    "this ratio is 1:2.53@xmath300.46 @xcite and at 2.85 gev it is 1:1.59@xmath300.27 @xcite .",
    "this suggests a deviation from the statistical approach , especially at lower energies .",
    "similar conclusions can also be drawn from experiments on double pion production at excess energies below 100 mev @xcite where the statistical approach fails .",
    "we discuss the cross section ratios under different assumptions about the dominating reaction mechanism in section 3 of this paper .    with a 4@xmath31 facility such as wasa @xcite , aiming for measurements of decays of @xmath3 and @xmath32 mesons produced in @xmath0 interactions ,",
    "the understanding of the  reactions becomes very important as they constitute a severe background for the studies of @xmath3 and @xmath32 decays into three pions .",
    "those decays provide key ingredients for determining the ratios of the light quark masses @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite , since the decay widths are proportional to the @xmath35 and @xmath36 quark mass difference squared . in order to estimate the effect of the background for the decay experiments , the properties of the  reactions for beam proton energies from 1.254 gev ( corresponding to the @xmath3 production threshold ) to 3 gev are important .",
    "there are no experimental points for the cross section of the  reaction in that energy range , and only three points for  all coming from old bubble chamber experiments @xcite .",
    "the experiment performed at the lowest energy , 1.48  gev , identified a single event @xcite ( corresponding to @xmath37 ) . moreover in the bubble chamber experiments , the prompt three pion production was not separated from the @xmath38 decays .",
    "the analysis is based on data collected with the wasa facility at celsius @xcite .",
    "the target system provides small ( @xmath39 m ) hydrogen pellets that interact with the circulating proton beam .",
    "the protons have nominal kinetic energies of 1.30 , 1.36 and 1.45  gev ( corresponding to excess energies , @xmath40 , in the center of mass system around 200 mev for the  reactions ) .",
    "the integrated luminosities at each energy were : 27  nb@xmath41 , 414  nb@xmath41 ( data on   reaction are based on a sample corresponding to 80  nb@xmath41 ) and 221  nb@xmath41 respectively .",
    "the wasa detector system consists of a multilayer forward detector ( fd ) , for measurement of the outgoing protons scattered in an angular range of 2.518@xmath42 , and a central detector ( cd ) containing an electromagnetic calorimeter and a drift chamber / solenoid for measuring the produced mesons and their decay particles in an angular range of 20140@xmath42 .",
    "the experimental method for extracting the cross section of the   reaction , relies on normalizing to the simultaneously measured @xmath43 reaction , with subsequent decay of the eta into @xmath44 ( branching ratio 22.7% @xcite ) or into @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "in this way , the reference reaction has the same particles in the final state , and most of the efficiency corrections cancel .",
    "the final state is selected by the requirement that two protons are detected in the forward detector .",
    "in addition the selected events should have six @xmath47 hit clusters ( with energy depositions of at least 20 mev ) in the calorimeter , for the @xmath48 case , or two @xmath47 hit clusters and two tracks with opposite bending in the central detector drift chamber , for the @xmath49 case .",
    "after identification of the two proton tracks in the fd no additional cuts on the proton - proton system are applied .",
    "the specific cuts for neutral and charged cd particles systems aim to select a clean 3@xmath31 final state . in case of the @xmath50 channel , already the requirement of",
    "the six neutral hit clusters in the cd results in a fairly clean data sample .",
    "the @xmath51 sample was obtained by requiring the invariant mass of the two photons to be located in the @xmath52 mass region , and the missing mass of the two protons plus the two photons to be greater than two pion masses .    two pion production , @xmath53 , is the major physical background which has to be considered in the analysis in view of its much higher cross section .",
    "the final state can be misidentified as a three pion event only in case of two additional hit clusters in the calorimeter , due to cluster split - offs , pile - up or noise . to reject the background strict time cuts",
    "are applied , as well as additional kinematical conditions  such as reconstruction of the total energy .",
    "the final contribution of the background is on the per cent level , in agreement with expectations from the monte carlo simulations .",
    "therefore the uncertainty in the exact value of the total cross section for the two pion channels , as well as in the reaction mechanism , only gives a minor contribution to the systematical error .     experimental @xmath0 missing mass distributions for @xmath54 final states with fit of the monte carlo distributions for 2@xmath31 , 3@xmath31 and @xmath3 production .",

    "the derivation of the cross sections for the @xmath55 reaction is based on the fact that the resolution in the @xmath0 missing mass determination is very good ( 4 mev / c@xmath56 fwhm at 1.30 gev ) and that the missing mass distribution is practically insensitive to the mechanism of the @xmath4 reaction .",
    "after the selection of the @xmath54 final states , the @xmath0 missing mass distribution is constructed from experimental data , and from monte carlo simulated data of the reaction channels , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 as the main background contribution .",
