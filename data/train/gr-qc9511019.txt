    "the de sitter metric is an early solution of the cosmological einstein s equations which has the same degree of symmetry as the flat minkowski solution and it can be seen as a one - parameter deformation of the latter which involves a fundamental length @xmath1 . the corresponding space - time may be represented by a @xmath0-dimensional one - sheeted hyperboloid @xmath2 embedded in a minkowski ambient space @xmath3 , and the invariance group is @xmath4 , the lorentz group of the ambient space .",
    "this group plays the same role as the poincar group on @xmath5 .",
    "models of quantum field theory ( qft ) on the de sitter space - time have been studied very often in the past , since the symmetry properties of this universe can be used as a guideline which greatly helps in the otherwise difficult task of quantizing fields in a gravitational background ; moreover , the radius @xmath1 may also be regarded as providing a ( de sitter covariant ) _ infrared cutoff _ for minkowskian qft s , whose removal regenerates automatically poincar covariance .    on the physical side ,",
    "there has been a great revival of interest for these models at the beginning of the eighties , when the de sitter metric appeared in the inflationary cosmological scenario . according to the latter ,",
    "the universe undergoes a de sitter phase in the very early epochs of its life @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation of phenomena having their origin in the very early universe then relies on an interplay between space - time curvature and thermodynamics and a prominent role is played by the mechanisms of symmetry breaking and restoration in a de sitter qft .    in view of the physical importance of these models , and also of the great theoretical significance of",
    "de sitter space - time , an enormous amount of work has been done concerning quantum field theory on this space - time and many mathematical aspects of the latter have been extensively developed ( see @xcite and references therein . ) most of this work has been devoted to the construction of quantum fields satisfying a klein - gordon type equation , since even this simplest case already sets non - trivial problems when the background space - time is curved .    in fact ,",
    "qft on a curved space - time is plagued by the phenomenon of non - uniqueness of the vacuum state . in the free field case such ambiguities immediately appear since",
    ", whenever a second quantization procedure is applied , it is based on mode expansions related to a given choice of local coordinates ( which generally cover only a part of the whole space ) . at a deeper level of investigation",
    "the considerable relativization of the concept of energy operator , reduced to be ( on curved space - time ) the infinitesimal generator of some one - parameter group of isometries interpreted as the proper time - evolution for the chosen system of coordinates of a certain observer , makes it impossible to characterize unambiguously the vacuum state of qft as a fundamental state for the energy in the usual sense ; indeed , in general _ no true spectral condition can be satisfied by a qft on a curved space - time and this is related to the proliferation of quantizations_.    in the case of de sitter space - time , where such ambiguities are present as in the general case , it has however been discovered that the _ hadamard condition _ selects a unique vacuum state for quantum fields satisfying the de sitter covariant klein - gordon equation ( see @xcite for two distinct senses in which this is true ) .",
    "the hadamard condition postulates that the short distance behavior of the two - point function of the field should be the same for klein - gordon fields on curved space - time as for the corresponding minkowskian free field .",
    "the fact that the hadamard condition selects a unique vacuum state for linear fields has actually been established for a wide class of space - times with bifurcate killing horizons , of which de sitter space - time is an example ( see @xcite and references therein ) ; in the de sitter case the preferred vacuum state thus selected coincides with the so called `` euclidean '' @xcite or `` bunch - davies '' @xcite vacuum state , and it singles out one vacuum in the two - parameter family of quantizations constructed in @xcite .",
    "however , the too special character of the hadamard condition if one wishes to deal with _ general interacting fields _ leads one to search another explanation of the existence of preferred de sitter vacuum states in the global structure of this space - time manifold and , as we shall see , of the corresponding complex quadric @xmath6 ( described by eq .",
    "( [ hyp ] ) , with @xmath7 varying in @xmath8 ) . in this connection ,",
    "the feature of the hadamard condition which will remain of general value for de sitter qft is the requirement that the two - point function is the boundary value of an analytic function `` from the good side '' ( i.e. the so - called @xmath9-rule . )",
    "the program which we have in mind concerning qft in de sitter space - time deals with the possibility of developping a general approach based on a set of fundamental principles , which should be completely similar to the wightman approach for minkowskian fields .",
    "this is by no means obvious , since in the latter many important concepts are based on the fourier representation of space - time , namely the energy - momentum space .",
    "therefore one major objective to be reached would be to dispose of a global de sitter - fourier calculus which would allow one to implement such important notions as wave propagation , `` particle states '' , etc .. however in a preliminary step , one can start from the idea that support properties in fourier space are closely connected ( via paley - wiener theorems ) to analyticity properties in the original space .",
    "in fact , let us recall that the basic momentum space properties of minkowskian qft ( in particular the spectral condition ) can be equivalently expressed as specific analyticity properties of the @xmath10-point correlation functions @xmath11 in complex minkowski space ; moreover it is known that ( in view of the `` reconstruction theorem '' @xcite ) any general sequence of distributions @xmath12 satisfying the relevant analyticity and positivity properties determine a unique wightman field acting in the associated `` gns - vacuum '' representation .    a major success of this analytic framework has been the derivation of the celebrated kllen - lehmann representation of general two - point functions which expresses the latter as ponderate superposition of `` elementary '' two - point functions satisfying a klein - gordon equation with arbitrary mass @xmath13 .",
    "the following important facts , connected with this representation , have inspired the first steps of our approach to general qft in the de sitter universe .",
    "\\i ) _ the global holomorphic structure of the two - point function _ ( both in complex space - time variables and in complex energy - momentum variables ) is _ of maximal type _ with respect to the principles of locality , covariance and positivity of the energy spectrum ; we mean that the ( physical sheet ) holomorphy domain of the two - point function , represented by a cut - plane in the relevant lorentz - invariant variable , could not be enlarged without imposing very special conditions ( such as local commutativity at time - like separation or lacunae in the energy spectrum ) .",
    "one can thus say that at the level of the two - point function , these general principles are completely encoded in the analyticity properties exhibited by the kllen - lehmann formula , which holds for all interacting local fields in the vacuum representation .",
    "\\ii ) being given any general two - point function @xmath14 satisfying the kllen - lehmann representation there exists a unique _ generalized free field _ which obeys the general principles and admits @xmath14 as its two - point function ( it is obtained via the gns construction by imposing that for this field all the truncated @xmath10-point functions @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , and @xmath17 vanish ) .",
    "\\iii ) as a by - product of ii ) , the free fields can be introduced by the previous construction starting from the `` elementary '' two - point functions which satisfy a klein - gordon equation .",
    "this way of introducing the free fields presents the advantage of being independent of any particular quantization procedure ; it moreover exhibits directly the various properties of the field from those of its two - point function .",
    "in this paper we will show that all the previous facts have their exact counterparts in the de sitter space - time thanks to the introduction of relevant analyticity domains on the complex quadric @xmath6 and to the ( related ) existence of a global fourier calculus on de sitter space - time whose primary steps are presented here .",
    "the starting point of our axiomatic approach to de sitter qft was precisely the discovery of the existence of two - point kernels on @xmath6 enjoying maximal analyticity properties ( similar to those of minkowskian two - point functions mentioned in i ) ) and equipped with causal discontinuities of retarded and advanced type on the real de sitter space @xmath18 .",
    "such holomorphic kernels had been introduced in the context of the theory of complex angular momentum in minkowskian qft @xcite , but the relevance of this global analytic framework for describing general two - point functions on the de sitter universe was first advocated by one the authors in @xcite , where ( as an application of the results of @xcite ) an integral representation of kllen - lehmann type was proved under a certain growth condition related to the dimension of the corresponding de sitter space - time .",
    "this paper presents several new achievements ( partly described in @xcite ) , which open the way to a genuine axiomatic approach to de sitter qft , and can be shortly described as follows .",
    "the results of @xcite concerning the global structure of general two - point functions are completed not only in themselves ( for example , the positivity of the weight of the kllen - lehmann representation is proven here ) but by the study of various field - theoretical aspects which they imply .",
    "in particular , having in view a possible general approach to de sitter qft , we treat the physical interpretation of the maximal analyticity property of two - point functions from the viewpoint of the `` energy content '' of the underlying qft s ( as a substitute to the spectral condition ) .",
    "of course , without any information on the @xmath10-point functions for @xmath16 , one can not infer a physical property of general interacting fields from the structure of the two - point function alone .",
    "this is why it was reasonable to construct and study at first the _ generalized free fields _ , the latter being uniquely determined by the two - point functions according to the gns procedure , as in the minkowskian case ( see ii ) above ) .",
    "moreover , such a construction presents the major interest of covering the free field case as a by - product , since the maximal analytic framework applies to all the elementary two - point functions which satisfy the de sitter - klein - gordon equation ( as in iii ) ) .",
    "our general result can then be stated as follows : in the maximal analytic framework which we consider , the two - point functions determine generalized free fields in a _ preferred representation _ which is characterized by a _",
    "well - defined kms condition _ formulated in appropriate regions of de sitter universe associated with geodesic observers .",
    "the well - known occurrence of hawking s thermal effects on de sitter space - time @xcite is given here a strikingly simple geometrical interpretation ; the kms condition is actually the `` natural substitute '' to the spectral condition when maximal analyticity on the temporal geodesics remains satisfied , the linear geodesics of the flat case being here replaced by hyperbolae .",
    "the maximal analytic framework also sheds light on the euclidean properties of the ( generalized ) free fields considered ; in fact all the two - point functions here considered define schwinger functions by restriction from @xmath6 to the sphere @xmath19 of `` imaginary times '' @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ hyp ] ) ) which plays the same role as the euclidean space in complex minkowski space . in the free field case , this allows us to identify our model with the pioneering euclidean formulation of the preferred vacua given in @xcite ( and of course also coincides with the preferred vacua selected by the hadamard condition ) .",
    "it is perhaps worthwhile to stress that properties of analytic continuation are at the basis of every treatment of de sitter field theories based on the functional integral on the euclidean sphere ; this includes the constructive approach to qft on de sitter space - time ( in this connection see @xcite ) or the application that de sitter theories may find in minkowskian constructive field theory , since the de sitter radius @xmath1 provides a natural infrared cutoff ( the euclidean space is compact ! ) . without the appropriate analyticity properties all results inferred by euclidean methods would not be relevant for the real de sitter universe .",
    "of course in the general interacting case one can not expect maximal analyticity properties to hold for @xmath10-point functions ( @xmath16 ) and again we are left with the task of finding a suitable general approach to de sitter qft ; to be relevant this approach should assure the possibility of going to the euclidean sphere , solving there the field equations , coming back to real de sitter world ( and possibly taking the limit @xmath21 if the de sitter radius is used as a cut - off ) . at the end of this paper",
    "we will present a set of axioms which is based on the previous ideas and which represents one possible solution to this problem . in a forthcoming paper @xcite",
    "we will show that the euclidean sphere ( minus the coinciding points ) _ does belong _ to the extended domain of analyticity of the @xmath10-point functions satisfying these axioms .",
    "a major contribution of this paper is the introduction of global fourier variables playing the role of mass and momentum variables , and of relevant laplace and fourier - type transformations ; in the latter the exponentials will be replaced by appropriate eigenfunctions of the laplace - beltrami operator which can be identified with _",
    "de sitter plane waves_. the introduction of de sitter plane waves in relevant tube domains of @xmath6 , first presented by one of the author in @xcite , yields a new integral representation of the free field two - point function ( and thereby a previously unknown integral representation of legendre - gegenbauer functions in their complex domain ) : this representation , is the analogue of the standard plane - wave expansion of @xmath22 in minkowski space ; it also allows one to control in a very suggestive way the limit of de sitter qft to minkowski qft when the de sitter radius tends to infinity .",
    "in fact it is at basis of our study of the free field in its various aspects .",
    "the family of analytic plane waves we will introduce also suggests the definition of a suitable fourier type transformation , which maps test functions on @xmath18 to homogeneous functions on its asymptotic cone ; similar transforms had also been introduced in the context of harmonic analysis on @xmath18 in the framework of the @xmath23 representation theory @xcite , but with our definitions we can derive new mathematical results more adapted to our analytic framework based on the complex quadric @xmath24 .    besides it will be seen in a further work @xcite that by applying our fourier transformation to the special case of @xmath4-invariant retarded propagators one recovers the _ laplace transform _ of the latter , which coincides with the so - called spherical laplace transform of invariant volterra kernels introduced in @xcite .",
    "this laplace transform , which depends on a single variable interpreted as a complex mass , is the genuine analogue of the minkowskian two - point green function in the invariant mass variable : its property of being holomorphic in a half - plane and the characterization of the euclidean schwinger function by the values of this laplace transform at discrete imaginary masses ( which is a generalization of the so - called imaginary time formalism ( itf ) of thermal qft ) @xcite are recalled here in view of their importance .    in @xcite , all these notions will be developed so as to produce a genuine fourier calculus on de sitter space , which could hopefully be applicable to the @xmath10-point functions of a general field theory , to investigations on the notion of particle and to the computation of feynman amplitudes .    here",
    "we make use of the fourier transform to describe the hilbert space structure of the ( generalized ) free field theories and the associated representation of the de sitter group . in particular we prove the validity of the reeh - schlieder property , which is another important aspect of the analyticity framework which we wish to stress .",
    "the latter will be established here for de sitter ( generalized ) free fields by arguments which are very close in their spirit to the proof of the original theorem in minkowski space and differ from the recent proof of @xcite , applicable to free fields on the class of ( not necessarily analytic ) ultrastatic spacetimes .",
    "the principle of uniqueness of analytic continuation ( applied under the refined form of the `` edge - of - the - wedge '' theorem in a complex manifold ) together with the use of the ( analytic ) fourier transformation we have introduced appear to be the main reasons for the validity of this property , and we believe that this would also hold for a large class of manifolds equipped with a holomorphic structure , provided the two - point functions considered are boundary values of holomorphic functions from relevant tuboid domains ( see appendix a ) . as a matter of fact , properties of this nature ( extended to the @xmath10-point functions ) could represent a reasonable `` microlocal''substitute to the spectral condition for a suitable class of manifolds .",
    "one can hope that there exists a formulation of such an axiomatic approach in the framework of the analytic wave - front set theory @xcite ( where a local substitute of the analytic fourier transformation would be available ) in the spirit of the one proposed in @xcite ( for general space - time manifolds ) in the framework of the @xmath25 wave - front set theory @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows :    section 2 is devoted conjointly to the presentation of general two - point functions on de sitter space - time enjoying maximal analyticity properties and to the construction and characterization of models of generalized free fields associated with such two - point functions . in ",
    "2.1 and 2.2 we fix the notations and introduce the fock representation for fields satisfying only the requirements of locality and de sitter covariance ; in  2.3 we introduce the notion of `` normal analyticity '' for general two - point functions and show that this is sufficient to recover the maximal analyticity ( perikernel property ) of @xcite ; for the associated generalized free fields this is equivalent to postulating the _ geodesic spectral condition _ or the _ geometric kms condition _ of  2.4 , supplemented by an appropriate `` antipodal condition '' when the field correlation functions are considered as given on the whole space - time @xmath18 .    sections 3 and 4",
    "continue the study of section 2 under two different respects and can therefore be read independently .",
    "section 3 is a development of the general study of two - point functions , which is based on various results of @xcite . in ",
    "3.1 we introduce a feynman - type algebra and a substitute to wick - rotation in the space - time variables .",
    "the laplace transform of the retarded propagators is described in  3.2 .",
    "we devote  3.3 to describe the connection between this laplace transform at imaginary masses and the legendre expansion of the schwinger function .",
    "this substitute to the wick rotation property in momentum space ( called in @xcite the `` froissart - gribov property '' ) is a generalized form ( invariant under the de sitter group ) of the connection between rtf and itf in the thermal representations of qft in minkowski space @xcite . in ",
    "3.4 we present an integral representation of general two - point functions satisfying appropriate growth properties at infinity in @xmath18 ; for a specially interesting class of two - point functions , it takes the form of a genuine kllen - lehmann representation .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a detailed study of the de sitter - klein - gordon fields , which are exhibited as a class of basic elements of the general framework of section 2 .",
    "analogues of the plane - wave solutions of the klein - gordon equation are introduced in  4.1 following @xcite for the de sitter - klein - gordon equation , and a corresponding analysis of the linear quantum field is given in  4.2 .",
    "the use of the tubular domains of the complex hyperboloid is crucial for obtaining the relevant `` plane - wave representation '' of the two - point function , identified to a gegenbauer function of the first kind . in mathematical terms , we introduce in  4.3 a new version of the fourier transformation on the hyperboloid ( a purely mathematical study of this transformation will be developed in @xcite ) .",
    "this transformation allows us to completely characterize in  4.4 the hilbert space of `` one - particle '' states and the corresponding irreducible unitary representations of the de sitter group .",
    "we will also discuss in a simple and direct way the contraction of the unitary irreducible representations of the de sitter group ( giving rise to _ reducible _ representations of the poincar group @xcite ) .",
    "in section 5 we complete our discussion of general two - point functions . in ",
    "5.1 we prove the positivity property of the kllen - lehmann representation obtained in  3.4 for the relevant class of de sitter two - point functions by using the fourier type transform introduced in  4.3 .",
    "we then discuss in  5.2 the flat limit of de sitter gff : we show that the plane - wave representation introduced in  4.2 tends by contraction to the corresponding fourier representation of the minkowskian wightman function ; the same property is derived for de sitter general two - point functions having a kllen - lehmann decomposition .",
    "it follows from this analysis that group - theoretical contraction is not a suitable procedure to draw consequences on the structure of the limiting quantum field theory ; in particular no problem of negative energy arises in the latter .",
    " 5.3 is devoted to show the reeh - schlieder property for de sitter gff s .",
    "we conclude section 5 by some remarks on the qft s obtained by taking the restriction to @xmath18 of a minkowski qft in the ambient space .",
    "in our final section 6 we outline a possible wightman - type axiomatic approach to the theory of interacting fields on the de sitter space - time , which is formulated in terms of global analyticity properties of the @xmath10-point functions of the fields .",
    "consequences of this axiomatic approach will be discussed in a forthcoming paper @xcite .    throughout our work ,",
    "the wightman functions of the fields are described as distributional boundary values of analytic functions from relevant domains of the complex de sitter manifold , which we call `` tuboids '' @xcite ; a general survey of these mathematical notions is given in our appendix .",

    "<S> our method is based on the geometry of the complex de sitter space - time and on the introduction of a class of holomorphic functions on this manifold , called _ perikernels _ , which reproduce mutatis mutandis the structural properties of the two - point correlation functions of the minkowskian quantum field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the theory contains as basic elementary case the linear massive field models in their `` preferred '' representation . </S>",
