    "b ) the scale of the b - l symmetry breaking is related to the mass scale of the heavy right - handed majorana neutrino mass terms and provide the well - known see - saw mechanism @xcite to explain light left - handed neutrino mass .",
    "c ) the b - l symmetry and the scale of its breaking are tightly connected to the baryogenesis mechanism through leptogenesis @xcite . in addition",
    ", the model also contains an extra gauge boson @xmath1 corresponding to b - l gauge symmetry and an extra sm singlet scalar ( heavy higgs boson h ) .",
    "this may change the sm phenomenology significantly and lead to interesting signatures at the current and future colliders such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite , international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite and the compact linear collider ( clic ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , another higgs factory besides the lhc , such as the ilc and clic , which can study in detail and precisely determine the properties of the higgs bosons @xmath9 and @xmath10 , is another important future step in high - energy and high - luminosity physics exploration .",
    "the b - l model @xcite is attractive due to its relatively simple theoretical structure .",
    "the crucial test of the model is the detection of the new heavy neutral @xmath13 gauge boson and the new higgs boson @xmath14 .",
    "the analysis of precision electroweak measurements indicates that the new @xmath1 gauge boson should be heavier than about 1.2 @xmath15 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "searches for both the heavy gauge boson @xmath13 and the additional heavy neutral higgs boson @xmath14 predicted by the b - l model are presently being conducted at the lhc . in this regard , the additional boson @xmath1 of the b - l model has a mass which is given by the relation @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this boson @xmath1 interacts with the leptons , quarks , heavy neutrinos and light neutrinos with interaction strengths proportional to the b - l gauge coupling @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath1 boson can be detected by observing di - leptonic and di - jet signals at colliders .",
    "the sensitivity limits on the mass @xmath18 of the boson @xmath1 of the @xmath0 model derived for the atlas and cms collaborations are of the order of @xmath19 @xcite . in the case of the heavy neutral higgs boson @xmath10 of the b - l model ,",
    "this can be produced at the high - luminosity run at lhc ( hl - lhc ) through multiple production processes : gluon fusion , weak boson fusion , associated @xmath20 productions and the associated @xmath21 production mode , with subsequent decay in heavy particles .",
    "the dominant decay modes are @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "in addition , the heavy higgs @xmath10 can also be produced in association with a @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the discovery prospects of the heavy neutral scalar @xmath10 during the runs at hl - lhc are extensively studied in refs .",
    "it is noteworthy that future lhc runs at 13 - 14 @xmath15 could increase the @xmath1 mass bounds to higher values , or evidence may be found of its existence .",
    "precision studies of the @xmath1 properties will require a new linear collider @xcite , which will allow us to perform precision studies of the higgs sector .",

    "the higgs - strahlung process @xmath25 @xcite is one of the main production mechanisms of the higgs boson in the future linear @xmath2 colliders such as the ilc and clic .",
    "therefore , after the discovery of the higgs boson , detailed experimental and theoretical studies are necessary for checking its properties and dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is possible to search for the higgs boson in the framework of the b - l model ; however , the existence of a new gauge boson could also provide new higgs particle production mechanisms that could prove its non - standard origin .    in this paper",
    "we study the phenomenology of higgs bosons in the type i see - saw model @xcite of neutrino mass generation in presence of a spontaneously broken @xmath0 symmetry at future electron - positron linear colliders such as the ilc and the clic .",
    "we consider both physical higgs states emerging in the model , one of which is sm - like @xmath26 while the other @xmath14 is of b - l origin , both compliant with recent lhc data .",
    "we examine a variety of @xmath9 , @xmath10 decay channels while we concentrate on the @xmath27 and @xmath8 production modes , including the possibility of @xmath1 mediation , which could be resonant , as we allow for @xmath28 mixing ( in presence of relevant experimental constraints from lep ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors made a very exhaustive study of higgs physics through the higgs - strahlung processes @xmath29 , the associated production of a higgs boson and a pair top quark @xmath30 and the associated production of a higgs boson pair and a @xmath1 boson @xmath31 in the aforementioned b - l model at future @xmath2 linear colliders .",

    "@xcite is primarily a numerical analysis , whereas in the present paper we present a wealth of useful analytical formulae .",
    "in addition , our analytical and numerical results for the higgs bosons production and decay at future @xmath2 colliders are helpful in searching for signatures of new physics and could be of scientific significance .",
    "moreover , our study complements others studies on the b - l model and on the higgs - strahlung processes @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the different stages of high - energy and high - luminosity of the ilc and the clic would provide a clean environment to study the properties of additional @xmath1 and higgs bosons through the production of a @xmath28 in association with a higgs boson which is sm - like @xmath26 , while the other @xmath14 is of b - l origin .",
    "the different higgs boson production processes where the signatures can best be exploited to reveal the b - l nature of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and in association with heavy particles , both sm ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 bosons and @xmath34 ( anti)quarks ) and b - l ( @xmath1 boson and @xmath35 neutrinos ) , are @xmath36 ( higgs - strahlung process ) , @xmath37 ( ww vector boson fusion process ) and @xmath38 ( zz vector boson fusion process ) .",

    "the higgs self - coupling can be a non - trivial probe of the higgs potential and probably the most decisive test of the ewsb mechanism .",
    "detailed discussions on these processes and some new physics models can be found in refs .",

    "although we do not consider the background of the processes that we study , it is worth mentioning that the most important background of the processes studied in our article , @xmath25 and @xmath8 , are : @xmath43 for the @xmath44-quark final state ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 for the @xmath32-boson final state ( @xmath47 ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , our aim in the present paper is to study the phenomenology of the light and heavy higgs boson production and decay , as well as the sensitivity of the @xmath1 boson of the b - l model as a source of higgs bosons through the higgs - strahlung processes @xmath5 and @xmath6 , including both the resonant and non - resonant effects at future high - energy and high - luminosity linear @xmath2 colliders .",

    "the solid evidence for the non - vanishing neutrino masses has been confirmed by various neutrino oscillation phenomena and indicates the evidence of new physics beyond the sm . in the sm ,",
    "neutrinos are massless due to the absence of right - handed neutrinos and the exact b - l conservation .",
    "the most attractive idea to naturally explain the tiny neutrino masses is the seesaw mechanism @xcite , in which the right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos singlet under the sm gauge group is introduced .",
    "the gauged @xmath0 model based on the gauge group @xmath48 @xcite is an elegant and simple extension of the sm in which the rh heavy neutrinos are essential both for anomaly cancelation and preserving gauge invariance .",

    "for instance , the pure b - l model is obtain by the condition @xmath80 @xmath81 which implies the absence of mixing at the electroweak scale .",
    "other benchmark models of the general parameterisation are the sequential standar model ( ssm ) , the @xmath82 model and the @xmath83 model .",
