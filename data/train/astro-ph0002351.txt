    "element diffusion and mixing processes in stellar interiors are now widely constrained , first by detailed observations of abundances , second by helio and asteroseismology . in most cases however , pure microscopic diffusion in stars would lead to abundance variations much larger than those observed : mild macroscopic motions in stellar radiative zones are definitely needed to account for the observations .",
    "this gives strong constraints on the kind of mixing processes allowed .",
    "other constraints come from the consequences of the nuclear reactions occuring in stellar interiors : in some cases stellar mixing from the atmosphere down to the regions of nuclear processing is needed to explain the observed element abundances .",
    "this is the case , for example , to account for the depletion of lithium in the sun and solar type stars .",
    "lithium observations in main - sequence population i field stars and galactic clusters show a large abundance dispersion which has been extensively studied in the literature ( see reviews by deliyannis 2000 , charbonnel 2000 , michaud 2000 and pinsonneault 2000 ) .",
    "the lithium abundance decreases for decreasing effective temperature below 5500k and the depletion increases with increasing age .",
    "this is generally attributed to the deepening of the convective zone , associated with some mild mixing process connecting the bottom of the convective zone with the nuclear destruction region .",
    "lithium is also depleted in f - type stars ( the so - called  boesgaard dip \" ) .",
    "several possible reasons have been invoked to explain this feature , most related to mixing and nuclear destruction .",
    "element segregation has been proved negligible here as it would lead to unobserved variations of metal abundances ( turcotte et al 1998 ) and beryllium ( boesgaard 2000 ) .    on the other hand , observations of lithium in main - sequence population",
    "ii field stars show remarkably constant abundances , with a very small dispersion ( e.g. bonifacio and molaro 1997 ) why is lithium destroyed in pop  i stars while it does not seem destroyed in pop  ii stars ?    for the same effective temperatures , the convective zone is smaller in pop  ii stars than in pop  i stars because of their smaller metallicity .",
    "meanwhile they have a smaller rotation velocity on the average .",
    "this could explain why the lithium destruction induced by nuclear reactions is smaller in these stars than in pop  i stars .",
    "however the element segregation is more important for smaller densities and smaller rotation , so that this process should lead to a visible lithium depletion , which is not observed ( vauclair and charbonnel 1995 and 1998 ) .",
    "this represents the so - called  lithium paradox \" .",
    "here we suggest that the influence of @xmath4-gradients on the rotation - induced mixing may help solving this paradox .",
    "in rotating stars , the equipotentials of `` effective gravity '' ( including the centrifugal acceleration ) have ellipsoidal shapes while the energy transport still occurs in a spherically symetrical way .",
    "the resulting thermal imbalance must be compensated by macroscopic motions : the so - called `` meridional circulation '' ( von zeipel 1924 ) .",
    "the stellar regions outside the convective zones can not be in complete radiative equilibrium .",
    "they are subject to entropy variations given by  : @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents the heat flux , @xmath7 the nuclear energy production and @xmath8 an energy generation rate which results from sources and sinks of energy along the equipotentials .",
    "the vertical component of the meridional velocity @xmath9 is computed as a function of @xmath8 in the stationary regime ( from eq .",
    "1 ) :    @xmath10    which , for a perfect gas , reduces to : @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the local gravity , @xmath13 and @xmath14 the usual adiabatic and real ratios @xmath15 and @xmath16 the mean molecular weight contribution @xmath17 .",
    "the expression of @xmath8 is computed by expanding the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( 1 ) on a level surface and writing that its mean value vanishes .",
    "mestel ( 1953 , 1957 and 1965 ) pointed out that , in the presence of vertical @xmath4-gradients , @xmath8 contains two kinds of terms : those related to the resulting horizontal variations of @xmath4 : the so - called `` @xmath4-induced currents '' @xmath18 and those independent of @xmath4 , the so - called `` @xmath19-induced currents '' @xmath20 .",
    "the expression of @xmath8 obtained in this case has been derived in detail by maeder and zahn ( 1998 ) , who took into account several effects which were not included in the previous computations : more general equations of state instead of perfect gas law , presence of a thermal flux induced by horizontal turbulence , non - stationary cases .",
    "vauclair ( 1999 ) discussed more simple expressions , valid only for negligible differential rotation . in this case",
    "@xmath4-currents are opposite to @xmath21-currents in most of the star and @xmath8 may be written :    @xmath22    with : @xmath23 - { 2 h_{t } \\lambda \\over r } \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath24 represents the density average on the level surface @xmath25 while @xmath26 is the mean density inside the sphere of radius @xmath27 ; @xmath28 is the temperature scale height ; @xmath29 represents the horizontal @xmath4 fluctuations @xmath30 ; @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent the derivatives : @xmath33    vertical @xmath4-gradients may occur in stars due to two different processes : first the nuclear reactions which occur in the stellar cores , second the helium settling which occurs in the outer layers .",
    "the importance of the first process in reducing or even suppressing the meridional motions has been demonstrated several times in the literature ( e.g. huppert and spiegel 1977 ) .",
    "the second process on the other hand has not been extensively studied .",
    "we claim here that it may play a crucial role for understanding the lithium problem in pop  i and pop  ii stars .",
    "computations of @xmath4-currents induced by the helium settling in halo stars have been performed by vauclair 1999 and thado and vauclair 2000 a and b. we found that , for slow rotation , @xmath4-currents cancel @xmath21-currents for very small concentration gradients , corresponding to @xmath4-gradients of order @xmath34  @xmath35 .",
    "let us summarize the situation of a slowly rotating star in which element settling leads to an increase of the @xmath4-gradient below the outer convection zone . at the beginning , the star is homogeneous and meridional circulation can occur , leading to upward flows in the polar regions and downward flows in the equatorial parts ( except in the very outer layers where the gratton - pik term becomes important , which we do not discuss here ) .",
    "the @xmath4-currents , opposite to the classical @xmath21-currents , are first negligible .",
    "the @xmath4-gradients increasing with time because of helium settling , the order of magnitude of the @xmath4-currents also increases until it reaches the value for which the circulation vanishes .",
    "this does not occur all at once : as the @xmath4-gradient decreases with depth below the convective zone , we expect that the meridional circulation freezes out step by step ( see figure 1 of thado and vauclair 2000a ) .",
    "an equilibrium situation may be reached , in which the temperature and mean molecular weight gradients along the level surfaces are such that @xmath21-currents and @xmath4-currents cancel each other .",
    "once it is reached , this equilibrium situation is quite robust .",
    "suppose that some mechanism leads to a decrease of the @xmath4-gradient : then @xmath36 becomes smaller than @xmath37 and the circulation tends to be restablished in the @xmath37 direction , thereby restoring the original @xmath4 gradient .",
    "suppose now that the @xmath4-gradient is increased",
    ". then @xmath36 becomes larger than @xmath37 and the circulation begins in the @xmath38 direction . here again the original gradient is restored .",
    "when the meridional circulation is frozen below the convective zone , helium settling could proceed further ; however , due to the increase of the diffusion time scale with depth , this would modify the @xmath4-gradient .",
    "we may thus expect that @xmath4-currents would take place and restore the original equilibrium gradient , thereby strongly reducing the microscopic diffusion ( thado and vauclair 2000b )",
    ". this self - regulating process could be the reason for the low dispersion of the lithium abundance in the lithium plateau of halo stars .",
    "there are many observations in stars which give evidences of mixing processes occuring below the outer convective zones as , for example , the lithium depletion observed in the sun and in galactic clusters .",
    "the process we have described above should not apply in all these stars .",
    "the reason could be related to the rapid rotation of young stars on the zams and to their subsequent rotational braking .",
    "the abundance determinations in the solar photosphere show that lithium has been depleted by a factor of about 140 compared to the protosolar value while beryllium has not been depleted by more than a factor 2 , and maybe much less , as discussed by balachandran and bell ( 1997 ) . these values represent strong constraints on the mixing processes in the solar interior .",
    "observations of the @xmath1he/@xmath39he ratio in the solar wind and in the lunar rocks ( geiss 1993 , geiss and gloecker 1998 ) show that this ratio may not have increased by more than @xmath2 since 3 gyr in the sun .",
    "while the occurence of some mild mixing below the solar convective zone is needed to explain the lithium depletion , the @xmath1he/@xmath39he observations put a strict constraint on its efficiency . the only way to obtain such",
    "a result is to postulate a mild mixing , which would be efficient down to the lithium nuclear burning region but not too far below , to preserve the original @xmath1he abundance .",
    "the efficiency of this mixing should also decrease with time , as the @xmath1he peak itself builts up during the solar life .",
    "it is interesting to compute the minimum enhancement of the @xmath1he/@xmath39he ratio implied by the lithium observed depletion .",
    "vauclair and richard 1998 showed that it is possible to deplete lithium by a factor larger than @xmath40 as observed and not increase @xmath1he/@xmath39he by more than 5 percent since the solar origin . in this case beryllium",
    "is only depleted by about 10 percent .",
    "such a confined mixing zone is also needed from helioseismology  : although the introduction of pure element settling in the solar models considerably improves the consistency with the seismic sun , some discrepancies do remain , particularly below the convective zone where a `` spike '' appears in the sound velocity ( richard et al 1996 , turck - chize et al .",
    "it has been shown that this behavior may be due to the helium gradient which would be too strong in case of pure settling .",
    "mild macroscopic motions below the convective zone slightly decrease this gradient and helps reducing the discrepancy ( richard et al 1996 , corbard et al 1998 , brun et al 1998 ) .",
    "the helium profiles directly obtained from helioseismology ( basu 1998 , antia and chitre 1998 ) show indeed a helium gradient smoother than the gradient obtained with pure settling .",
    "the constraints implied by both the helioseismic inversions and abundance determinations in the sun converge towards the existence of a small mild mixing region below the convective zone , which would extend down to a depth of the order of one scale height .",
    "the implied mixing region must be very mild , with diffusion coefficients of @xmath41 - @xmath42 only .",
    "it must also be completely deconnected from the solar core .",
    "no mixing can indeed be allowed down to the nuclear energy production region as it would lead to a sound velocity incompatible with helioseismology .",
    "in particular the mixing processes invoked by morel and schatzman 1996 to decrease the neutrino fluxes are excluded by helioseismology ( richard and vauclair 1997 ) .",
    "mixing processes localized at the boundary between convective and radiative regions include overshooting and regions of large differential rotation like the  tachocline \" below the solar convective zone .",
    "up to now , overshooting was generally treated in the models simply as a continuation of the convective zone on a fraction of a pressure scale height .",
    "recent parametrisations use a diffusion coefficient which decreases exponentially with decreasing radius ( freytag et al 1996 ) .",
    "the tachocline , which represents in the present sun the small boundary between the region of large differential rotation ( in the convective zone ) and the region of solid rotation ( in the radiative zone below ) is also treated as a mixed layer with an exponentially decreasing diffusion coefficient ( brun et al 1998 , richard 1999 ) .",
    "results are encouraging , although more sophisticated numerical simulation including 2-d abundance variations would be needed to go further .",
    "in any case , the self - regulating process that we have discussed for halo stars in section  3 would not apply below the convective zone in the sun and solar type stars because of the differential rotation which takes place there .",
    "such a differential rotation would not be expected in halo stars if we suppose that they always rotated slowly and thus did not suffer large transport of angular momentum . the different behavior for the lithium abundance in pop  i and pop  ii stars could thus be directly related to their rotation history .",
