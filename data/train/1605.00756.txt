    "<S> [ [ robustness . ] ] robustness. + + + + + + + + + + + +    in closed systems topological properties are known to be robust against perturbations that do not close the energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it interesting to ask whether the winding of the polarization in an open system can be robust against hamiltonian and liouvillian perturbations .    </S>",
    "<S> for the spin chain we evolved the stationary state numerically , employing the time - dependent block decimation ( tebd)@xcite to investigate robustness in sufficiently large systems ( @xmath90 ) along a circular path as indicated in fig.[fig : robustness ] a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> for the fermionic chain , which is linear in fermionic operators , we can calculate the polarization of its steady state semi - analytically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however because we add perturbations that are non - linear in fermionic operators like dephasing or spatial randomness , we can only check for robustness in small periodic systems of four sites . </S>",
    "<S> this is sufficient because topological effects should not depend on system size .    </S>",
    "<S> specifically we analyzed three different types of perturbations which preserve the phs of the steady state : ( i ) a spatially random magnetic field in the @xmath91-direction with uniform distribution , ( ii ) dephasing , and ( iii ) additional local losses compensated by local pumps with equal rates . </S>",
    "<S> in the first case we add a hamiltonian @xmath92 , where @xmath93 denotes a lattice site and @xmath94 $ ] are independent random magnetic field strengths . as can be seen from fig.[fig : robustness ] b ) this perturbation has negligible influence on the polarization and does not affect its winding . in the second case we add an additional lindblad term with @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the dephasing rate . </S>",
    "<S> this term , too , has almost no effect on @xmath7 and does not change its winding . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true for homogeneous losses and gain . </S>",
    "<S> these have to be added with equal rates @xmath97 however in order to maintain the phs of the system , i.e. @xmath98 : @xmath99 , and @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> the small effects of these non - hermitian perturbations are shown in fig.[fig : robustness ] c ) .    </S>",
    "<S> most interestingly @xmath101 between two inversion - symmetric points on the @xmath61 axis remains intact even in the presence of spatially homogeneous losses ( see fig.[fig : robustness ] c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> these findings are important , because they show that in an open system topological properties such as the quantized charge pump can be maintained even in the presence of unwanted losses , if the system remains phs .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ topological - singularity . ] ] topological singularity. + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    for open gaussian systems it has been argued in @xcite that a topological singularity , at which a topological phase transitions takes place , is connected to the closing of at least one of the two , the damping gap or the so - called purity gap . </S>",
    "<S> the damping gap is determined by the real part of the eigenvalues of @xmath42 , @xmath102 , which characterize the relaxation rate of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the steady state is a right eigenstate of @xmath42 with eigenvalue @xmath103 and the damping gap @xmath104 is the distance to the next larger value of re@xmath105 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the purity gap of fermionic systems is determined by the eigenvalue spectrum of the positive semidefinite matrix @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the antisymmetric and real steady state single - particle correlation matrix @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the damping gap is difficult to obtain from tebd simulations and we have performed exact simulations for a four - site problem for the fermionic and non - linear spin chains . while even for such small system sizes we can already observe a quantized winding of the polarization , the damping gap is sizable everywhere ( see supplementary material for details ) .    for the fermion model , which is gaussian , </S>",
    "<S> the purity gap is shown in fig.[fig : gaps ] a ) . </S>",
    "<S> one recognizes a closing of the purity gap at the origin @xmath108 consistent with the behavior of the polarization . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that our classification is in agreement with previous schemes for gaussian systems such as in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the spin system can not be mapped to a free fermionic model the concept of the purity gap can not be applied here . </S>",
    "<S> however for small systems with four sites we can evaluate the eigenvalue spectrum of the full density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the two dominant eigenvalues of @xmath30 never become equal ( see fig.[fig : gaps ] b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> although these calculations can only be done for finite systems this indicates that there is no closing of a `` generalized '' purity gap since an indicator of a topological transition is expected to be independent of system size . </S>",
