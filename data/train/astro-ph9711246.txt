    "the inflationary scenario and the cold dark matter ( cdm ) models have become one of the most popular theoretical starting point to describe the formation and evolution of structures in the universe using numerical simulations . given the failure of the standard cdm model ( dimensionless density parameter @xmath12=1 and a hubble constant @xmath13 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 with @xmath15 ) to reproduce the observed distribution of galaxies at large scales , several attempts have been made in order to construct new consistent models .",
    "the introduction of a cosmological constant ( @xmath16 ) in the cdm scenario allows for a flat universe ( @xmath17 ) with @xmath18 as suggested by observations .",
    "on the other hand , measurements of the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite have determined the normalization of different power - spectrums of primordial density fluctuations and therefore the present value of the root mean square mass fluctuation @xmath19 in spheres of radius @xmath20 mpc in the models .",
    "recently cole et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have analyzed the galaxy - galaxy two - point correlation function in cobe - normalized cdm models with different density parameters @xmath21 and cosmological constant @xmath22 using numerical simulations .",
    "the authors explore the ability of these cdm models to reproduce observed cluster number densities .",
    "their results suggest that cobe - normalized cdm models with parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( with age of the universe @xmath27 12 and 14 gyr respectively ) provide a suitable fit to observations .",
    "these models successfully reproduce observed cluster abundances without requiring a strong bias of the distribution of particles in the simulations in order to fit the observed galaxy - galaxy correlation function .",
    "the two - point correlation functions are powerful statistical tools to compare the observed distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters and the corresponding model predictions .",
    "the autocorrelation function of bright optically selected galaxies is well described by a power - law fit of the form @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 mpc ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the joint distribution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies can also be statistically described using the cluster - galaxy two - point cross correlation function @xmath31 .",
    "seldner & peebles ( 1977 ) in their cross - correlation analysis of abell clusters and lick counts find a suitable power - law fit @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 15 @xmath9mpc .",
    "using similar data , lilje & efstathiou ( 1988 ) argue for a lower value of amplitude @xmath35 mpc with slope @xmath36 .",
    "the reasons for the different reported amplitudes rely mainly on the assumed distribution of redshifts of lick galaxies and deserve further analysis . moreover , since several authors have found dependences of the galaxy - galaxy and cluster - galaxy correlation lengths on galaxy luminosity , cluster richness , intracluster gas temperature and velocity dispersion , ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) a careful analysis of the target properties is required to confront properly models and observations .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the distribution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies in two cobe - normalized cdm models ( open and flat ) through numerical simulations .",
    "we confront the results of the simulations to observations using a sample of clusters of galaxies taken from the apm cluster catalog and a sample of galaxies from las campanas redshift survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "section 2 describes the numerical simulations performed and section 3 deals with the analysis of the data . in section 4",
    "we confront model results to observations and we analyze the ability of the models to reproduce the observed correlation functions .",
    "cobe temperature fluctuation measurements allows to determine the normalization of of the cdm mass fluctuation spectrum for different values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in figure 1",

    "( 1995 ) and cole et al .",
    "the solid and dashed thin lines correspond to open models with @xmath24 and flat models with @xmath37 , respectively . in this figure",
    "it is also shown ( thick line ) the corresponding relation between these parameters found in open cdm models ( dashed ) and flat ( solid ) corresponding to the fit of the cluster temperature function computed by eke , cole & frenk ( 1996 ) .",
    "the intersection of these curves provide the suitable values of the parameters that fit simultaneously cluster abundances and cobe normalizations . by inspection to this figure",
    "it is apparent our choice of models : open , with @xmath38 ; and flat , with @xmath39 ( both with a hubble parameter @xmath40 ) that fulfill this condition .",
    "the vertical lines show the allowed range of values of @xmath19 compatible with the observed relative fluctuations in the number of bright galaxies @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43mpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , no strong biasing of the spatial distribution of particles is required to infer the properties of the galaxy distribution in these models .",
    "for these two models ( open and flat ) we have performed n - body numerical simulations using the adaptative particle - particle particle mesh ( ap3 m ) code developed by couchman ( 1991 ) .",
    "initial positions and velocities of particles were generated using the zeldovich approximation corresponding to the cdm power spectrum .",
    "the computational volume is a periodic cube of side length 195 @xmath9 mpc .",
    "we have followed the evolution of @xmath44 particles in a @xmath45 grid mesh and 4 levels of refinements as a maximum .",
    "the resulting mass per particle is @xmath46 .",
    "we have adopted an analytic fit to the cdm power spectrum of the form    @xmath47^{1/2 } } \\left ( \\frac{ln(1 + 2.34q)}{2.34/q } \\right ) ^{2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 mpc @xmath14 , @xmath49 exp-@xmath50 and @xmath51 is the value of the baryon density parameter imposed by nucleosynthesis theory ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the initial conditions correspond to redshift @xmath52 and the evolution was followed using 1000 steps .",
    "we identify centers of mass of clumps of particles in the simulations using a standard friends - of - friends algorithm with a linking length @xmath53 kpc , where @xmath54 is mean particle density ( @xcite ) . using these centers we define the clusters in the simulations as the particles within abell radius @xmath55mpc and compute the corresponding cluster masses . in figure 2",
    "we show the resulting cumulative mass function of the two cdm models at redshift @xmath56 and the analytic fit to observations given by bahcall & cen ( 1993 ) . following cole et al .",
    "( 1997 ) we show a box indicating the mass range of clusters with observed abundance @xmath57 mpc @xmath58 . as it can be appreciated in this figure",
    "there is a good agreement between observations and the two models analyzed consistent with cole et al .",
    "( 1997 ) results .",
    "in this section , we compute the projected two - point cluster - galaxy and galaxy - galaxy cross - correlation function ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively ) , where @xmath61 is the projected distance between targets ( clusters or galaxies ) and tracers ( galaxies ) .",
    "we estimate the projected target - tracer cross - correlation function using @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the mean number of target - tracer pairs separated by a projected distance @xmath64 in the data and @xmath65 corresponds to targets with random angular positions and with the same redshift distribution than the data targets .",
    "the determination of the spatial correlation function @xmath66 from @xmath67 requires the inversion of    @xmath68    this integral extends over all line - of - sight separations @xmath69 of target - tracer pairs .",

    "angular positions and apparent @xmath75 magnitudes are available for all galaxies in cosmos . at faint magnitudes",
    "@xmath75 mis - classification of stars and galaxies , plate zero - points and photometric errors become critical . taking this fact into account , and in order to check our estimates of the correlation function fitting parameters we have defined two samples of tracers with limiting @xmath75 magnitudes @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we have selected target clusters from the apm cluster survey ( @xcite ) restricting our analysis to clusters with apm richness 30 @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath78 60 and with radial velocities in the range 10,000 - 40,000 km s@xmath14 since the number density of clusters falls rapidly beyond 40,000 km s@xmath14 . the lower limit in radial velocity",
    "was adopted in order to avoid large angular separations in the computation of correlations .",
    "the restriction on apm richness @xmath79 is based on the fact that clusters with @xmath79 @xmath80 30 are very poor and their number density continuously fall beyond 15000 km / s .",
    "there are only 8 clusters with @xmath79 @xmath81 60 , these objects were also not included in our studies since their radial velocities are beyond the mean of our sample ( @xmath82 25000 km / s ) .",
    "it should also be remarked that the selection procedure used to build the apm cluster survey makes it free from artificial inhomogeneities ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have considered two subsamples according to the richness parameter : 30 @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath7840 and 40 @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath78 60 in order to search for possible richness dependences of cluster - galaxy correlations . to check the consistency of our results we have also computed @xmath1 using samples of clusters taken from david et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and ebeling et al .",
    "( 1996 ) which provide intracluster temperatures ; and from fadda et al .",
    "( 1996 ) which provide estimates of cluster velocity dispersions . from these samples we selected clusters with radial velocities in the same range than that adopted for the apm clusters and",
    "the corresponding analysis serves as an independent reproducibility test of our results .",
    "the sample of target galaxies is taken from las campanas redshift survey ( hereafter lcrs ) , schectman et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "the average radial velocity of these galaxies is @xmath82 30,000 km s@xmath14 and extends to @xmath82 80,000 km s@xmath14 .",
    "given uncertainties in the derivation of spatial correlations from projected data we have attempted to focus our analysis on targets with similar redshift distributions since real differences of spatial correlations among the samples would directly reflect in the projected correlation functions .",
    "the distribution function of radial velocities of lcrs galaxies is shown in solid line in figure 3 .",
    "for comparison is also shown with dashed line the corresponding distribution of 30 @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath78 60 apm clusters .",
    "the dotted line in the figure indicates the resulting distribution of lcrs galaxies radial velocities where a radial gradient is imposed through a monte - carlo rejection algorithm that gives a similar distribution than the apm cluster sample , hereafter restricted lcrs galaxies .",
    "we have adopted power - law fits @xmath83 in the range 0.2 @xmath9mpc @xmath84 10 @xmath9mpc and 0.2 @xmath9mpc @xmath84 4 @xmath9mpc for cluster - galaxy and galaxy - galaxy correlations respectively . in figure 4",
    "we show @xmath60 and @xmath59 and the corresponding power - law least squares fits .",
    "error bars correspond to estimates derived from the bootstrap resampling technique developed by barrow , bhavsar & sonoda ( 1984 ) with 30 bootstrap target samples . for the derivation of @xmath73 from equation ( 4 )",
    "it is necessary to estimate the constant @xmath85 as an integral that includes the luminosity function in the case of a magnitude limited sample of tracers such as cosmos catalog .",
    "for this purpose , we use a schechter function fit to the luminosity function of cosmos galaxies with parameters @xmath86 ( @xcite ) , a k - correction term of the form @xmath87 , and a flat cosmology ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "it should be recalled the various sources of error involved in the determinations of the values of @xmath7 through the inversion of equation ( [ wr ] ) such as uncertainties in the luminosity function parameters , k - corrections and cosmological model , as well as observational biases involving selection effects , photometric errors , etc .",
    "the results of our statistical analysis are shown in table 1 .",
    "the quoted errors in the values of @xmath7 were derived through propagation from the rms errors in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 power - law fits and variations in c due to uncertainties in the luminosity function parameters , added in quadrature .    from inspection to this table one can notice that the value of the correlation length of the galaxy - galaxy correlation function for the restricted lcrs sample is @xmath89mpc , lower than the standard value of 5.4 @xmath9mpc .",
    "this is mostly probably due to a luminosity effect ( @xcite , @xcite ) given that the majority of target galaxies in this sample are @xmath90 .",
    "the values of the cluster - galaxy cross - correlation lengths shown in table 1 are @xmath91 larger than those derived by lilje & efstathiou ( 1988 ) ( except for the @xmath92 @xmath79 @xmath93 apm cluster sample ) where it may be argued that these differences may rely on the selection function adopted for the lick catalog .",
    "it can also be seen in this table that the richest clusters have larger values of @xmath94 ( @xcite ) .",
    "for comparison we have also computed the cross - correlation function for a sample of abell clusters with measured temperatures and velocity dispersions ( @xcite , @xcite ) in the same range of radial velocities .",
    "these samples , although with a small number of targets also show somewhat large values of @xmath94 compared to lilje & efstathiou ( 1988 ) results , consistent with our estimates of apm clusters and giving additional support to our results .",
    "it should be remarked that the derived values of the cluster - galaxy correlation length found are not likely to be biased high due to systematics or deprojection calculations given the relatively low value of the galaxy - galaxy correlation length obtained for targets with an equivalent redshift distribution .",
    "in order to compare the results of observations and numerical models we have used 30 @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath78 60 apm clusters taking advantage of the statistically significant number of target objects in a well defined volume and the fact that the apm cluster catalog is free from projection and subjective biases . in order to make an appropriate comparison with observations we have attempted to select a subsample of clusters in the numerical simulations with comparable characteristics to this apm cluster sample .",
    "since the apm cluster catalog provides a suitable richness parameter @xmath79 we have used 18 apm clusters with measured line of sight velocity dispersions @xmath95 ( @xcite ) to provide a suitable relationship between @xmath95 and apm cluster richness @xmath79 .",
    "we have also added 15 apm clusters with measured temperatures @xmath96 ( @xcite ) using @xmath97 where @xmath95 is km / s and @xmath96 in kev . given the dispersion of the correlation between @xmath79 and @xmath95 a simple linear relation of the form @xmath79= @xmath98 provides a suitable fit to the data .",
    "we assign an equivalent apm cluster richness @xmath79 to the clusters in the simulations applying this relation to the actual radial velocity dispersions of the simulated clusters and select a set of clusters with the same @xmath79 distribution and number density ( 10@xmath99 h@xmath100 mpc@xmath58 ) than our @xmath101 @xmath79 @xmath102 apm cluster sample .",
    "this procedure provides a suitable set of clusters in the numerical simulations that can be confronted to observations .",
    "first , we have considered each particle a galaxy in both open and flat cdm numerical simulations .",
    "we have computed the cluster - galaxy @xmath103 and galaxy - galaxy @xmath104 two - point cross - correlation functions in the numerical simulations where @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the mean number of cluster - galaxy , galaxy - galaxy and random - galaxy pairs at spatial separation @xmath108 .",
    "the derived cluster - galaxy correlation functions can be fitted by power - laws in the range 2 and 20 @xmath9mpc . in table 2",
    "are listed the corresponding values of correlation length @xmath7 and slope @xmath74 of the power - law fits to @xmath31 and @xmath109 in the models . quoted uncertainties in this table correspond to errors of the least squares fits .",
    "errors in @xmath94 have added in quadrature the corresponding dispersion of values due to the spread in the observed @xmath79-@xmath95 relation . by comparison of tables 1 and 2 , and in agreement with cole et al .",
    "( 1997 ) it can be seen that the open model requires practically no bias , while the flat model a moderate anti - bias .",
    "due to the failure of the flat model to reproduce the observations we have generated different mock catalogs of galaxies for this model associating a probability @xmath110 of the particles being a galaxy according to different prescriptions .",
    "we smooth the density field calculating the density @xmath111 centered in each particle within a sphere of radius @xmath112 mpc .",
    "we have adopted two different models for @xmath113 : a power law , @xmath114 and a step function @xmath115 if @xmath116 , @xmath117 otherwise .",
    "both models are constrained to provide a @xmath0 consistent with observations .",
    "we have found that the cluster - galaxy cross - correlation function @xmath118 of the models for different parameters are very similar .",
    "this is expected since the antibias is not too strong and the imposed observational constrain on @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting power - law fitting parameters of @xmath109 with @xmath119 and a suitable value of @xmath120 are shown in table 2 where it can be seen the good agreement with observations for this simple power - law anti - biasing model .",
    "nevertheless @xmath1 of the models do not fit the observations , the cluster - galaxy cross - correlation lengths of the open and flat antibiased cdm models are @xmath121 lower than observed with a statistically significant confidence . in figure 5",
    "are shown the cluster - galaxy correlation function of the models and the observations where it is apparent the inconsistency of the models . in order to check the statistical stability of our results we have taken into account the observed dispersion in the @xmath79 -@xmath95 relation in the selection of clusters in the numerical simulations .",
    "we find negligible changes in the correlation lengths of the models suggesting that our results are not too strongly dependent on the particular selection of the simulated clusters .",
    "if only the @xmath82 10 richest clusters are used in the cross - correlation analysis , significantly larger values of @xmath122 h@xmath14 mpc may be obtained .",
    "certainly this can not be used for a proper comparison to observations since the abundance of apm clusters @xmath123 @xmath124 mpc@xmath58 corresponds to @xmath125 clusters in our computational volume .",
    "the derivation of spatial correlations involve the selection function of cosmos galaxies and therefore play an important role uncertainties in the luminosity function parameters , k - corrections , etc .",
    "the ratio of correlation functions in the power law approximation writes :    @xmath126    where @xmath127 , @xmath128 is the gamma function and @xmath129 and @xmath74 refer to the amplitude and slope of the projected correlation fits , defined in section 3 .",
    "this ratio is independent of the deprojection uncertainties already mentioned and therefore provide an unbiased measure of the relative clustering of galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "figure 6 displays the ratio of the cluster - galaxy to the galaxy - galaxy correlation functions @xmath130 for the numerical simulations and the observations .",
    "it can be seen in this figure the large disagreement between the observations and the model results showing that observed clusters are in higher density galaxy environment than the simulated clusters in the cdm models explored .",
    "we have tested an open , and a flat @xmath131 dominated cobe normalized cdm model through the computation of the cluster - galaxy cross - correlation function in order to shed new light on the observational viability of this structure formation scenario .",
    "our analysis of the cluster - galaxy cross - correlation function provides a significant statistical evidence of the failure of cobe normalized cdm models to reproduce the extended halos of clusters . in spite of the success of these models in reproducing the abundance of rich clusters and the general pattern of galaxy clustering",
    ", the high observed amplitude of cluster - galaxy correlations can not be reproduced in the models .",
    "these results are consistent with the virial analysis of clusters in cole et al .",
    "( 1997 ) where a positive bias is needed in the flat @xmath131 dominated cdm model to fit observed cluster m / l ratios .",
    "a detailed comparison of models and observations should be stressed since we have found significant dependences of the cross - correlation function parameters on the velocity dispersion of the clusters in both simulations and observations .",
    "our results rely on a well controlled sample of galaxy clusters as well as on a comparable set of clusters from numerical simulations giving confidence on our results against the ability of cobe - normalized cdm models to reproduce the joint distribution of galaxies and clusters .",
