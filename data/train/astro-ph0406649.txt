    "there are mainly three kinds of pumping mechanisms for stable oh maser : by infrared photon , by collision or by chemical reaction(elitzur,@xcite ) .",
    "harvey et al.(@xcite ) favoured the radiative pumping mechanism for 1612mhz oh maser in the envelope of oh / ir stars because they found that the oh maser and ir flux were varying together with almost no phase delay in these sources .",
    "elitzur(@xcite ) had systematically studied the observational facts and the theoretical considerations of the pumping mechanism of the oh masers . in circumstances where the radiative pumping is favored ,",
    "the 34.6 and 53.3@xmath0 m photons had been thought to be the main pumping photons to excite the oh molecules from the ground rotational state @xmath5 to their upper states @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "the exited oh molecules then cascade down to invert the @xmath8 and @xmath9 fine - structure levels in the ground state .",
    "but astronomers had no chance to probe these absorption lines until the infrared space observaotry ( iso - kessler et al.@xcite ) opened mid and far  infrared ( ir ) observations otherwise impossible behind the veiling of the atmosphere .",
    "justtanont et al.(@xcite ) and lutz et al.(@xcite ) were the first to find in iso spectra the 34.6@xmath0 m absorption line associated with oh maser sources .",
    "the former found it in , a red supergiant ( rsg ) , while the latter found it in , the galactic center ( gc ) . the next year , sylvester et al.(@xcite ) also profitted from the iso short wavelength spectrometer and long wavelength spectrometer ( sws & lws ) observations to find the ir pumping absorption line at 34.6@xmath0 m together with the oh cascade emission lines at 98.7 , 163 and 79@xmath0 m towards another well known rsg : .",
    "thai - q - tang et al.(@xcite ) modelled the pumping of the oh maser in the envelope of this star .",
    "their work confirmed the radiative pumping mechanism for the stellar 1612mhz oh maser .",
    "the 34.6@xmath0 m absorption in another rsg , , was also reported by neufeld et al.(@xcite ) .",
    "these previous works call for systematic check for infrared pumping lines of the stellar oh 1612mhz masers .    in our previous paper ( he et al.@xcite , here after paper i ) , the 34.6@xmath0 m absorption is found in only 3 rsgs , 2 gc sources and a megamaser and tentatively in another two objects ( one hii region and one mira ) while it is expected but not detected in another 16 galactic oh / ir sources ( these are mainly oh / ir stars , miras and pne ) .",
    "several mechanisms suggested for explaining non  detections remain open for further analysis .    in this paper , the 53.3@xmath0 m spectrum of 102 ( out of 137 ) iso lws spectra associated with 47 galactic oh / ir sources and 4 iso lws spectra associated with two megamasers are analyzed . some new 53.3@xmath0 m line detection and non  detection sources are found .",
    "the 53.3@xmath0 m line profiles are classified , discussed and correlated to simbad object classes and the detection of 34.6@xmath0 m line . in sect.[obsprocess ] , the observational data is described .",
    "the detectability of the 53.3@xmath0 m line is discussed in sect.[detectability ] .",
    "the dependence of the oh maser efficiency on the iso ir color is presented in sect.[isoirc ] .",
    "the profiles are classified in section [ profiles ] .",
    "section [ comp35and53 ] compares the results of the 53.3 and 34.6@xmath0 m lines while the oh pump rate of several sources are derived in sect.[ohpump ] .",
    "a brief summary is given in sect.[summary ] .",
    "iso had observed more than 100 oh / ir sources during its 26 months mission , but not all of them were observed spectroscopically around 53.3@xmath0 m .",
    "a search is performed in the iso data achive ( ida ) for associations with oh / ir sources based on a large oh / ir source compilation which combines the catalogue provided by b.m .",
    "lewis ( including eder , lewis and terzian@xcite , lewis , eder and terzian@xcite , lewis@xcite , chengalur et al.@xcite and lewis@xcite ) with oh / ir catalogues from atca telescope(sevenster et al.@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and similar catalogues from many other papers ( this unpublished large compilation contains 1876 oh / ir sources ) .",
    "chen et al.(@xcite ) cross - correlated this large oh / ir compilation with the infrared astronomical satellite low resolution spectral catalogue ( iras / lrs ) and discussed the lrs properties of these sources .",
    "an extension of chen s table of oh / ir sources with lrs identification was also given in electronical form in paper i. in the present paper , the same oh / ir source compilation is cross - correlated with the iso / lws spectra database and 137 iso / lws spectra covering the 53.3@xmath0 m region are found to be associated with 47 galactic oh / ir sources within a positional error of 1@xmath10 .",
    "note that the iras position is used to do the identification , hence the identification results given here can be slightly different from that automatically generated by ida because the simbad positions of the sources used by ida are not necessarily the same as their iras positions .",
    "the details of the cross - correlation are given in table[sptable ] in which only the 102 spectra ( out of 137 ) for galactic oh / ir sources and the 4 spectra of megamasers are listed .",

    "some of the oh / ir sources ( 12 sources out of 47 ) have more than one iso lws associations . for most of these oh / ir sources ,",

    "the actual spectral resolution depends on the scan speed . for the 106 lws spectra used in this paper , the spectral resolution around 53.3@xmath0 m",
    "is found to be about 0.0015 ( 2 spectra ) or 0.068@xmath0 m ( 1 spectrum ) for lws 04 mode , 0.035 ( 3 spectra ) , 0.07 ( 2 spectra ) or 0.14@xmath0 m ( 3 spectra ) for lws 02 mode , 0.035 ( 10 spectra ) , 0.07 ( 66 spectra ) , 0.14 ( 12 spectra ) or 0.28@xmath0 m ( 7 spectra ) for lws 01 mode .",
    "details of the iso lws instrument and observations can be found in clegg et al.(@xcite ) .",
    "those spectra with the 53.3@xmath0 m line feature detected and tentatively detected can be defined as group ` a ' and ` t ' and are marked in table[sptable ] by superscripts ` a ' and ` t ' respectively ; the other non  detections can be defined as group ` u ' .",
    "another two spectra with spurious broad emission feature around 53.3@xmath0 m are defined as group ` e ' and marked by superscript ` e ' in table[sptable ] .",
    "the tentative detections are defined as those spectra with measured line depth / height smaller than 3 times of the sigma noise level of the continuum flux .",
    "the spurious emission - like feature in group - e spectra is , according to the iso lws handbook , caused by a near - infrared light leakage in the blocking filters located in front of the detectors . among the 106 iso lws spectra , there are 21 group - a , 24 group - t , 2 group - e and 59 group - u ones",
    ". the group - u can be further divided according to their 53.3@xmath0 m continuum flux 3 sigma noise level into 5 sub - groups : u1 , u2 , u3 , u4 and u5 with the 3 sigma noise level @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 of the continuum flux level respectively .",
    "totally there are 15 group - u1 , 9 group - u2 , 16 group - u3 , 14 group - u4 and 5 group - u5 spectra .",
    "the group - u1 and u2 spectra are considered as highly probable non ",
    "detection cases for the 53.3@xmath0 m line while the other group - u3 , u4 and u5 spectra can be considered as noisy spectra .",
    "therefore , the detection and non  detection rates based on the counting of spectra can be estimated to be @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively , if the group - t spectra are considered as detections and the group - e spectra are excluded .",
    "here we do not defined non  detections as we did in paper i where we compared the 3 sigma noise level with the expected 34.6@xmath0 m line depth estimated from the blue peak intensity of the oh 1612mhz maser because : ( 1 ) no theoretical hint about the quantitative relationship between the 53.3@xmath0 m line and the oh 1612mhz maser line strength is available ; ( 2 ) the filling emission feature widely appearing in the 53.3@xmath0 m line profile , as we will see in the following discussions , makes it meaningless to compare the directly measured 53.3@xmath0 m line depth / height with the oh maser line strength .",
    "the above classification is visualized in fig.[sig - cont ] in which the horizontal lines delineate how the group - u is further divided into subgroups .",
    "this figure also shows that the detection of the 53.3@xmath0 m line feature generally occurs in spectra with low 3 sigma noise and high continuum flux , which indicates that the selection effect produced by the limited sensitivity of iso lws spectrometer ( _ sensitivity selection effect _ ) is serious in our sample .",
    "therefore , some weak non  detections could be explained by the insufficient sensitivity of the instrument .",
    "note that two non  detection spectra marked by their source names in the figure show abnormally high noise ; they are both lws 04 spectra .",
    "maybe the iso lws 04 mode is sometimes not as reliable as the other modes .",
    "m continuum 3 sigma noise level against the continuum flux .",
    "the horizontal lines delineate how the group - u spectra are further grouped into u1 , u2 , u3 , u4 and u5.,width=340 ]    our sample of iso spectra is biased by selection effects because the observations were originally designed for quite different purposes by different observers . beside the _ sensitivity selection effect _ mentioned above , another prominent selection effect in our sample spectra is the different resolutions used for different observations . as fig.[stresolv ] shows , most of the spectra were observed with a resolution of 0.07@xmath0 m while a non  negligible number of observations are performed with higher or lower resolutions ( _ resolution selection effect _ ) .",
    "the different resolutions will affect the strength of spectral features and hence affect the detectability of the 53.3@xmath0 m line .",
    "the detectability of the 53.3@xmath0 m oh line feature depends on several facts such as noise level , resolution and the genuine strength of the line feature itself .",
    "as described above , our sample of spectra are affected by instrumental sensitivity and resolution selection effects .",
    "if the spectra either with 3 sigma noise level higher than @xmath80 or with resolution other than 0.07@xmath0 m are excluded , we can define a relatively more homogeneous sampleii with 43 spectra in it .",
    "based on sampleii another detection and non  detection rate can be re - estimated to be @xmath81 ( 32 spectra out of 43 ) and @xmath82 ( 11 spectra out of 43 ) respectively .",
    "we do not further constrain the detection and non  detection rate upon the effect of the genuine 53.3@xmath0 m oh line strength because it is difficult to estimate an expected line strength for this oh absorption line due to the reasons described earlier .",

    "all galactic stellar 53.3@xmath0 m detections turn out to show filling emission in one of their hyperfine component , as discussed in sect.[profiles ] .",
    "this may indicate that the asymmetric doublet profile or filling emission is a common phenomenon for galactic oh 1612mhz maser .",
    "such an asymmetric filling emission might be best explained by the selective cascade of photons from energy levels higher than @xmath1 .",
    "we also checked the 34.6@xmath0 m absorption line profile of the three rsgs and found that the two components of the doublet are basically of equal strength in their sws 07 spectra , therefore such an asymmetric 53.3@xmath0 m doublet is highly probably produced by transitions among energy levels not higher than @xmath2 .",

    "the nearly similar pump rate of the three rsg oh masers suggests that their maser pumping mechanisms may be the same  very possibly pure radiative pumping .",

    "the most prominent is the very small ` pump rate ' ( @xmath123 ) of the two gc sources : ( =) and ( =) . such a small pump rate supports the previously discussed large interstellar contribution to the strong 34.6 and 53.3@xmath0 m absorption lines .",
    "the pump rate of the star burst galaxy , , is 0.32 which is much larger than that of rsgs and even larger than the theoretically predicted pump rate of 0.25 .",
