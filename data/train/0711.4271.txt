    "during the last decade , a great deal of attention has been paid to examining different quantum optical models @xcite .",
    "recently an iteration technique @xcite has been suggested to solve the schrdinger equation which improves both analytical and numerical solutions of the problems and has been developed for some quantum optical systems .",
    "the solution of quantum optical hamiltonians are important in the existing literature . in general , the study of two level - systems in one and two - dimensional geometry coupled to bosonic modes has been the subject of intense attention because of its extensive applicability in various fields of physics @xcite . due to the practical and technological importance of these models , it is not surprising that various aspects have been studied both analytically and numerically @xcite .",
    "such systems have often been analyzed using numerical methods , because the implementation of the analytical techniques does not yield simple analytical expressions .",
    "remarkably , exact solutions have not been thus far presented except for special cases , even though it has been suggested that the problem may be solved exactly .",
    "the required analytical treatments need tedious calculations .",
    "quantum optical models are one of the most fascinating phenomena in modern physics and chemistry , providing a general approach to understanding the properties of molecules , crystals and their origins .",
    "most of these hamiltonians have yet to be solved exactly .",
    "therefore , the natural question arising at this point is : can the asymptotic iteration method be applied and used to obtain the solutions to these systems ?",
    "the answer of this question is the main topic of this paper .    in recent years",
    "much attention has been focused on the asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) @xcite .",
    "this method reproduces exact solutions to many exactly solvable differential equations and these equations can be related to the schrdinger equation .",
    "it also gives accurate results for non - solvable schrdinger equations , such as the sextic oscillator , cubic oscillator , deformed coulomb potential , etc .",
    "which are important in applications to many problems in physics .",
    "encouraged by its satisfactory performance through comparison with other methods , we feel tempted to extend aim to solve matrix differential equations . although aim has been applied to solve the schrdinger equation , its application to the solution of the matrix equations @xcite still needs to be improved .",
    "in contrast to the solution of the schrdinger equation including potentials of coulomb , morse , harmonic oscillator etc . by using aim , study of the matrix hamiltonians",
    "has not attracted much attention in the literature .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on the solution of a general two - dimensional two mode bosonic hamiltonian by using aim in this paper .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss transformation of the hamiltonians whose original forms are given as boson and fermion operators .",
    "we show that the hamiltonian can be expressed as two coupled first order differential equations in the bargmann - fock space . in section 3 ,",
    "we develop aim to obtain eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the different matrix hamiltonians widely used in physics .",
    "section 4 is devoted to solve a wide class of physical hamiltonians in the framework of the aim .",
    "finally we conclude our results in section 5 .",
    "the most general form of the hamiltonian consists of the coupling of a single spin-1/2 to the boson field in two dimensional geometry .",
    "it can be written as @xmath1where @xmath2 and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are physical constants .",
    "the pauli matrices @xmath5 are given by @xmath6and bosonic annihilation @xmath7 and creation @xmath8 operators satisfy the usual commutation relations@xmath9 = \\left [ b , b^{+}\\right ] = 1;\\quad \\left [ a , b\\right ] = % \\left [ a^{+},b^{+}\\right ] = \\left [ a^{+},b\\right ] = \\left [ a , b^{+}\\right ] = 0 .",
    "\\label{e3}\\]]it is seen that the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) includes various physical hamiltonians depending on the choice of the parameters , and it is hermitian if @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 for real parameters . in general @xmath14",
    "describes spin phonon ( photon ) relaxation in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "it can also be used to study interaction of a two - level atom with an electromagnetic field . as explicit examples , when @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the hamiltonian @xmath14 reduces to the @xmath18 jahn - teller ( jt ) hamiltonian @xcite and when @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath16 and @xmath21 then the hamiltonian @xmath14 becomes the hamiltonian of quantum dots including spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "one can also obtain jaynes - cummings ( jc ) hamiltonian @xcite and modified jc hamiltonian @xcite as well as many other interesting physical hamiltonians by appropriate choices of the parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath4 in ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "there exists a relatively large number of different approaches for the solution of the eigenvalue problem for @xmath24 in the literature .",
    "however , we present here a systematic treatment for the determination of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of ( [ e1 ] ) in the context of aim .",
    "we note that the hamiltonian of a physical system is given in the form of a differential equation in some cases .",
    "one way to obtain the bosonic form of a hamiltonian is to construct a suitable differential form of the bosons .",
    "therefore , it is worth discussing some useful differential forms of the bosons and the connection between them before we begin to present a procedure to solve ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "we are interested in the two - level systems in a one and two - dimensional geometry whose hamiltonians are given in terms of bosons - fermions or matrix - differential equations . by the use of the differential form of the operators one can easily find the interrelation between boson - fermion and matrix differential equation formalisms of the hamiltonians .",
    "there are various differential forms of the boson operators . at this point ,",
    "let us start by introducing the following differential forms of the boson operators : @xmath25where @xmath26 is the length parameter . in principle , if a hamiltonian is expressed by boson operators , one could rely directly on the known formulae of the action of boson operators on a state with a defined number of particles without solving differential equations .",
    "apart from the mentioned method , the hamiltonians can often not be solved exactly , then we need to develop alternative methods .",
    "it is amazingly interesting that the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) can be solved within the framework of the aim when it is transformed into the form of the first order coupled differential equations under the constraints that will be given in eqs.([e11a])-([e11d ] ) .",
    "now , we briefly discuss three well known differential forms of the bosons and the relation between them . in order to obtain different forms of the bosons we present a transformation procedure . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we take @xmath27 and then @xmath28 becomes unity .    consider the following exponential operator @xmath29 .   \\label{e5}\\ ] ] the operator acts on the bosons as follows : @xmath30if we set @xmath31 and change the variable @xmath32 in the transformation given in ( [ e6 ] ) , we obtain the following relations @xmath33the other important differential forms of the bosons can be obtained by transforming the bosons with the following operator : @xmath34 .",
    "\\label{e8}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the rotation angle of bosons .",
    "the action of the operator on the bosons is given by @xmath36for @xmath37 , the boson operators take the form @xmath38the last formulation is known as the bargmann - fock space description of bosons @xcite and this form plays a key role when constructing the one - variable first order matrix differential equation form of ( [ e1 ] ) . when we insert the form ( [ e10 ] ) in ( [ e1 ] ) , the hamiltonian @xmath14 becomes a first order and two variable matrix differential equation . in order to separate the variables , we look for the conserved quantity of the system .",
    "after some treatment , we obtain the following conserved quantities :    @xmath39    we note here that although we obtain four conserved quantities , @xmath40 conjugates with @xmath41 and @xmath42 conjugates with @xmath43",
    ". they can be provided by a similarity transformation    @xmath44    where @xmath45 .",
    "it is well known that if two quantum mechanical operators commute then they have common eigenfunctions .",
    "thus one can write @xmath46 and the eigenvalue problem can easily be solved in the bargmann - fock space .",
    "thus , we obtain the following expressions for the eigenfunctions of @xmath47 and @xmath48 :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 stands for the up state and @xmath51 stands for the down state . in this case",
    "one can normalize the wavefunction @xmath52 by using the relation    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the weight function and the integral is taken over all space .",
    "the eigenfunction of the hamiltonian can be obtained from the relation @xmath55 meanwhile we note that the conserved quantity @xmath56 crucially depends on the conservation of the number of particles . the classical motion of the particle takes place in the space of angular momentum on a sphere .",
    "however , to obtain a physical meaning of @xmath47 from another perspective ; when the motion of the particle takes place on an ellipsoid , the conserved quantity is given in the form of ( [ e12 ] ) .",
    "we have obtained four different conserved quantities for the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) depending on the choice of parameters .",
    "however , it is fact that @xmath40 and @xmath41 can easily be mapped into each other .",
    "it implies that hamiltonians obtained under the constraints ( [ e11a ] ) and ( [ e11c ] ) correspond to physically similar systems .",
    "we also say that @xmath42 and @xmath43 can also be mapped into each other and the hamiltonians obtained under constraints ( [ e11b ] ) and ( [ e11d ] ) also correspond to physically similar systems .",
    "therefore , it is valid to discuss the solution of the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) under the conditions given in ( [ e11c ] ) and ( [ e11d ] ) .    since eqs .",
    "( [ e11a ] ) and ( [ e1 ] ) commute , then they have the same eigenfunctions under the constraint given in ( [ e11a ] ) .",
    "thus , insertion of ( [ e13c ] ) into the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) and using the form ( [ e10 ] ) , we obtain the following set of one variable coupled differential equations :    @xmath57 \\phi _ { 1}\\left ( z\\right ) + \\left [ \\left ( k+1+z\\frac{d}{dz}\\right ) \\kappa _ { 1}+\\kappa _ { 4}z\\right ] \\phi _ { 2}\\left ( z\\right ) = 0   \\label{e15a}\\ ] ]    @xmath58 \\phi _ { 2}\\left ( z\\right ) + \\left",
    "[ \\gamma _ { 3}\\frac{d}{dz}+\\gamma _ { 2}\\right ] \\phi _ { 1}\\left ( z\\right )   = 0   \\label{e15b}\\ ] ]    where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the eigenvalue of the hamiltonian @xmath14 and @xmath61 and @xmath62 correspond to up and down eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath14 , respectively . similarly , when we substitute ( [ e13d ] ) into the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) with the form ( [ e10 ] ) , we obtain the following set of one variable coupled differential equations :    @xmath63 \\phi _ { 1}\\left ( z\\right ) + \\left",
    "[ \\kappa _ { 2}+\\kappa _ { 4}z\\right ] \\phi _ { 2}\\left ( z\\right ) = 0   \\label{e16a}\\ ] ]    @xmath64 \\phi _ { 2}\\left ( z\\right ) + \\left",
    "[ \\gamma _ { 1}(k+1)+\\left ( \\gamma _ { 3}-\\gamma _ { 1}z\\right ) \\frac{d}{dz}\\right ] \\phi _ { 1}\\left ( z\\right ) = 0 .",
    "\\label{e16b}\\ ] ]    where @xmath65 .",
    "our task is now to apply the aim to solve the corresponding hamiltonian .",
    "in this section we systematically present a procedure for the solution of @xmath66 first - order matrix differential equations . consider the following first order matrix differential equation :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 ^{t}$ ] , two component column vector @xmath69 is a @xmath70 matrix function .",
    "note that @xmath71 and @xmath69 are functions of @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the first derivative with respect to @xmath72 .",
    "now , in order to obtain a general solution to this equation in the framework of the aim we use similar arguments to those given in @xcite . the differential equation ( [ e19 ] ) can be written as the two coupled equation @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are elements of the matrix @xmath69 .",
    "it is easy to show that the @xmath77 derivative of @xmath78 and @xmath79 can be written as @xmath80 in order to discuss the asymptotic properties of ( [ e1 ] ) , it is necessary to determine the coefficients @xmath81 and @xmath82 . after some straightforward calculation , we can obtain the following relations : @xmath83 our task is now to introduce the asymptotic aspect of the method . for this purpose , the @xmath77 and @xmath84 derivatives of @xmath78 and @xmath85 can be written as @xmath86 the coefficients @xmath76 and @xmath87 include the coupling constants .",
    "therefore , for sufficiently large @xmath88 we can suggest the following asymptotic constraints : @xmath89 in this formalism , the relations given in ( [ e24 ] ) imply that the wave functions @xmath78 and @xmath85 are truncated for sufficiently large @xmath88 and the roots of the relations given in ( [ e24 ] ) belong to the spectrum of the matrix hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , one can easily compute the energy of the hamiltonian by solving ( [ e24 ] ) for the energy term when @xmath90 . under the asymptotic condition of ( [ e24 ] )",
    ", one can find the wave functions @xmath91 and @xmath79 .",
    "when we take @xmath92 and @xmath93 by using ( [ e23 ] ) under the constraints given in ( [ e24 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath94 substituting the expression of @xmath95 ( and @xmath96 ) given in ( [ e22 ] ) into ( [ e25 ] ) and then replacing the @xmath97 ( and @xmath98 ) in ( [ e21 ] ) , respectively , one gets the following expressions ; @xmath99    using the second equality in ( [ e26 ] ) , one can substitute @xmath85 into the first equality in eq.([e20 ] ) .",
    "thus , one writes @xmath100 and the solution is found as @xmath101 .",
    "\\label{phi1func2}\\ ] ] if the same procedure is performed for @xmath85 , one finds the solution as @xmath102 .",
    "\\label{phi2func1}\\ ] ]    an immediate practical consequence of these results is that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the various quantum optical hamiltonians can be determined . in the following sections",
    ", it is shown that this asymptotic approach opens the way to the treatment of a large class of matrix hamiltonians of practical interest .",
    "in this part , we apply the results of previous sections to obtain the solutions of the hamiltonians given by eqs .",
    "( [ e15a],b ) and ( [ e16a],b ) .",
    "we briefly discuss the corresponding physical system of each hamiltonian .",
    "in this case the hamiltonian includes two important physical hamiltonians : @xmath104 jahn - teller ( jt ) hamiltonian @xcite and hamiltonians of quantum dots including spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "when @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath105 , the hamiltonian @xmath14 reduces to the @xmath106 jt hamiltonian as we have mentioned before .",
    "it is obvious that the corresponding first order differential equations ( [ e15a],b ) for jt hamiltonian can be written in the following form : @xmath107 where the coefficients @xmath75 and @xmath76 are given by @xmath108    using a simple mathematica program one can compute @xmath109 and @xmath82 by using the relations given in ( [ e22 ] ) . on the other hand , for each iteration the expression @xmath110 ( and @xmath111 ) depends on different variables , such as @xmath112 and @xmath72 .",
    "it is also noticed that the iterations should be terminated by imposing the quantization condition @xmath113 as an approximation to ( [ e24 ] ) to obtain the eigenenergies .",
    "the calculated eigenenergies @xmath114 by means of this condition should , however , be independent of the choice of @xmath72 .",
    "the choice of @xmath72 is observed to be critical only to the speed of convergence of the eigenenergies , as well as for the stability of the process . in our study",
    "it has been observed that the optimal choice for @xmath72 is @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we set @xmath115 at the end of the iterations",
    ". we also note that the first value of the solution set of @xmath116 ( or @xmath117 ) is not physically acceptable unless the system is exactly solvable .    to fix the iteration number for convergence , the first twenty energy levels have been determined for @xmath118 iterations for the hamiltonian above .",
    "it has been obtained that @xmath119 for @xmath120 , @xmath121 for @xmath122 , @xmath123 for @xmath124 , @xmath125 for @xmath126 , and @xmath123 for @xmath127 iterations , respectively , for @xmath128 .",
    "it is obviously seen that there is no change in the @xmath129 energy value for @xmath130 . since it is also the same for the other hamiltonians given below , @xmath131 iteration is assumed to be sufficient for the determination of the energy eigenvalues of the related hamiltonians .    in table",
