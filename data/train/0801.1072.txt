    "in the first paper of this series devoted to the study of the interaction of globular clusters ( gcs ) in triaxial galaxies , we analyzed the face - on collision between two gcs moving on quasi - radial orbits in the central galactic region , with the aim , also , to understand how effective is the tidal distortion .",
    "our first finding was that the face - on collision is practically uneffective respect to the role of the external tidal field .",
    "actually , the tidal erosion has been shown to be such to destroy _",
    "loose _ gcs ( initial king concentration parameter @xmath0 ) in few passages through the galactic centre , while _ tight _ cluster ( @xmath1 ) keeps bound a substantial amount of their mass up to the complete orbital decaying . at this",
    "latter regard , another important result is that the orbital energy dissipation due to the tidal interaction is of the same order of that caused by dynamical friction . at the light of these results , and given that dynamical friction was shown to be important in segregating massive gcs in triaxial potentials ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , a natural further step in the present program of investigation is to study the possible merging of a set of gcs decayed in the central galactic region to see whether a sort of super star cluster ( ssc ) results from the merging , and what its morphological and dynamical characteristics could be .",
    "it is quite ascertained the existence of very bright ( @xmath2l@xmath3 ) clusters of stars in the central region of galaxies across the hubble sequence thanks to vlt and hst observations @xcite . on the basis of integrated colours and of the estimated @xmath4 ratios",
    ", these clusters are usually thought to be young or , at least , to contain a significant population of young stars . in any case , that of the age is a controversal point , because , for instance , the nuclear star clusters ( ncs ) in m82 show evidence for mass segregation despite their spectra are well fitted by stellar population synthesis models with ages @xmath5@xmath6 myr @xcite .",
    "@xcite fitted analytical models to hubble space telescope images of 39 ncs in order to determine their effective radii after correction for the instrumental point - spread function .",
    "they compared the luminosities and sizes of ncs to those of other ellipsoidal stellar systems , in particular the milky way globular clusters , finding for ncs a narrow size distribution statistically indistinguishable from that of galactic gcs , even though the ncs are , on average , 4 mag brighter than the old gcs .",
    "they discuss some possible interpretations of the similarity among ncs and galactic gcs and , from a comparison of ncs luminosities with various properties of their host galaxies , find that more luminous galaxies harbor more luminous ncs .",
    "it remains unclear whether this correlation reflects the influence of galaxy size , mass , and/or star formation rate .",
    "however , @xcite , by means of spectroscopic hst / stis data , derived ncs ages for 19 galaxies and found that they range from 10 myr to 10 gyr , with a non negligible presence of old clusters . a comparable result has been deduced also for 9 ncs of very late - type , bulge - less spirals , by @xcite by means of a high - resolution spectroscopic survey with vlt / uves .",
    "@xcite , in their study of the stellar cuspy distribution around the supermassive black hole ( sbh ) in the galactic center , found that the k - band luminosity function of the local nc ( within 9  of sgr a * ) resembles that of the large - scale galactic bulge except for showing an excess of stars at @xmath7 .",
    "it fits with population synthesis models of an old , metal - rich stellar population with a contribution from young , early , and late - type stars at the bright end . in the central arcsecond",
    ", they argued that a stellar merger model is the most appealing explanation .",
    "these stars may thus be `` super blue - stragglers '' , formed and `` rejuvenated '' through mergers of lower mass stars in the very dense ( @xmath8 pc@xmath9 ) environment of the cusp .",
    "another intriguing piece of the puzzle of the structure of sscs is given by @xcite . through a comparison between the observational data on the kinematical structure of the very bright cluster g1 in m31 obtained with the hst wfp camera 2 and space telescope imaging spectrograph instruments and their results of dynamical simulations carried out using the special purpose computer grape-6",
    ", they obtained very good fits when starting simulations with initial conditions extracted from the end product of a previous simulation concerning a merging between two pre - existent star clusters .",
    "the merging explains observed features without the need to invoke the presence of an intermediate - mass black hole in the center of g1 .",
    "not many simulations have been presented in the literature that study the possible formation scenarios for sscs . among these",
    ", we remind those by @xcite finding that star clusters aggregates , like the ones found in the antennae or stephan quintet , are very likely the merger progenitors of sscs .",
    "interestingly enough , these authors also find that the resulting ssc is a stable and bound object , whose density profile is well fitted by a king profile , even if the mass loss of the merger product occurs through every perigalacticon passage .",
    "the increasing amount of data about massive clusters in galaxies , together with that of gc systems in galaxies , especially of early type but also for spirals ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "makes interesting the investigation , started in the first paper of this series ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) , of the fate of massive gcs moving in the parent galaxy field , subjected to dynamical friction braking and tidal interaction . in",
    "we studied the dynamical evolution of two gcs with mass @xmath10 m@xmath3 moving on quasi radial orbits in a triaxial galactic potential , following eight passages across the galactic center .",
    "the scope of that paper was to investigate the chances of survival of gcs to possible tidal disruption induced both by the external field and by mutual cluster - cluster interaction ; with this aim , we maximized these effects by giving the clusters initial conditions corresponding to quasi - radial orbits .    in this paper ii , we have another aim , that is to study whether and how the merging of various massive gcs decayed by dynamical friction in the inner galactic region may occur .",
    "the main questions to answer are : ( i ) given some ( realistic ) initial conditions for a set of gcs which experienced a significant orbital decay , are they undergoing a full merge ?",
    "( ii ) if so , what is the time needed ?",
    "( iii ) what is the final structure of the merged nc ? ( iv )",
    "does it attain a quasi - steady state ?",
    "the answers to these questions are of overwhelming importance to give substance to the interpretation of the formation of early type galaxy nuclei via merging of decayed gcs , a hypothesis raised first by @xcite and subsequently extensively studied by @xcite .",
    "this scenario of galactic nuclei formation has been raised again recently , due to the independent and almost contemporaneous findings that nc masses obey to similar scaling relationships with host galaxy properties as sbhs do ( see @xcite for spirals ; @xcite for dwarf elliptical [ de ] galaxies and @xcite for elliptical galaxies ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite give evidence , in early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster , of nc luminosity distributions that are much better fitted by an extended profile ( king s ) rather than by a point source ( see @xcite for a similar finding in late - type spirals and @xcite for de galaxies in the coma cluster ) . the half mass radii of nuclei ( @xmath11 ) are in the range @xmath12(pc ) @xmath13 , with @xmath14 pc and correlate with the nucleus luminosity : @xmath15 .",
    "the mean of the frequency function for the nucleus - to - galaxy luminosity ratio in nucleated galaxies , @xmath16 is indistinguishable from that of the super massive bh - to - bulge mass ratio , @xmath17 , calculated in 23 early - type galaxies . on these bases ,",
    "@xcite argue that resolved stellar nuclei are the low - mass counterparts of nuclei hosting sbhs detected in the bright galaxies .",
    "if this view is correct , then one should think in terms of central massive objects , either sbhs or sscs , that accompany the formation and/or early evolution of almost all early - type galaxies .",
    "it is clear that these characteristics of galactic nuclei well fit into a scenario of multiple gc merging in the inner galactic regions ( that we call `` dissipationless '' scenario ) as alternative to the `` dissipational '' scenario , this latter being based mainly on speculative hypotheses ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) supported by some quantitative results @xcite .",
    "the proof of the validity of the `` dissipationless '' hypothesis requires , at first , a detailed @xmath18-body simulation of the interaction of stellar clusters in the inner region of their parent galaxy , taking into account both the cluster - cluster and the cluster - galaxy dynamical interaction .",
    "this latter includes tidal distortion , acting on the cluster internal motion , and dynamical friction , acting on the cluster orbital motion .    in this context , we cite the encouraging results of the numerical simulations made by @xcite who revisited the hypothesis of de nuclei formation through the orbital decay of gcs and suggested that this occurs mainly in galaxies with a relatively weak extragalactic tidal perturbation , leading to the formation of compact nuclei within a hubble timescale .",
    "they also show that the central galactic field does not destroy the integrity of the clusters and facilitates the merging to occur .",
    "moreover , they find that the observed central structures of some nucleated virgo cluster des are well reproduced by superimposing a small number of globular clusters to the galactic stellar distribution",
    ". nevertheless , @xcite used a very small number of particles ( @xmath19 in each cluster ) to simulate the final merger stage , during which they neglected the role of dinamical friction , as well .",
    "thus , their results could be affected by spurious collisional effects , even though a rather large smoothing radius was adopted in the inter - particle interactions .",
    "more recently ,",
    "@xcite show how the formation of ncs via multiple merging of gcs , leads to systems with global scaling relations which are compatible with those observed for galactic nuclei .",
    "unfortunately , as mentioned before , these results can not be considered conclusive because in these authors simulations the , important , role of the external field was neglected .",
    "we consider gcs as @xmath18-body systems moving within a triaxial galaxy represented by an analytical potential , subjected also to the deceleration due to dynamical friction ( hereafter df ) . to keep a high level of resolution in the simulations (",
    "i.e. , a large number of particles to represent each gc without exceeding computational capabilities , we decided to limit our study to the interaction of a limited number , four , of gcs .",
    "we studied the merging process of these gcs , as if they were already decayed to the inner region of the galaxy , in two separate simulations ( cases 1 and 2 ) .",
    "a quick orbital decay induced by df is due to initial large values for the total mass of the clusters .",
    "these large masses are compatible with those of many young gcs actually observed in various galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , see .",
    "the 4 clusters are labeled , , ,  in the case 1 and , , ,  in the case 2 . in the simulation of case 2 ,",
    "the 4 gcs have the same initial orbital conditions but their scaling parameters are such to give them less dense and more extended initial configurations ( see also table [ tab1 ] and sect.[clumod ] ) .",
    "unless otherwise specified , the same units of measure used in are adopted in this paper : lengths , masses and time are measured , respectively , in unit of the galactic core radius @xmath20 , of the galactic core mass @xmath21 and of the galactic core - crossing time @xmath22^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "note that the actual physical values for these quantities are unrelevant because the results of simulations can be scaled as long as the 2-body stellar collisions are negligible ; otherwise , the dynamics would obviously depend also on the mass of the _ individual _ star in the clusters .",
    "as regards the computational techniques , we adopted an @xmath18-body representation for the stars in the clusters , simulating their dynamics by means of the parallel ` treeatd ' code @xcite , whose main features were also described in .",
    "we adopt the same galactic model used in the simulations of , i.e. the self - consistent triaxial model described in @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to a non - rotating ellipsoidal and triaxial distribution of matter oriented in such a way to have the longest and the shortest principal axis aligned with the coordinate axes @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the axial ratios are @xmath25 : @xmath26 : @xmath27 , leading to a projected profile in agreement with that observed in the spheroids of some spirals ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in elliptical galaxies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting potential can be expressed as the sum of a spherically simmetric density following the modified hubble s law _",
    "b(r)=_b0 ^-3/2 , [ hubble ] with scale parameters @xmath20 ( core radius ) and @xmath28 , plus other two non - spherical terms that give the triaxial behaviour @xcite .",
    "the mass parameter @xmath21 is the mass enclosed in a radius slightly smaller than @xmath20 , in fact @xmath29 .",
    "the mass in the generic sphere of radius @xmath30 is contributed only by the spherically simmetric part , @xmath31 , of total density , giving : @xmath32 \\right.\\ ] ]  - .(+1)^-1/2 } , [ m_di_r ] that gives an infinite total mass .",
    "however , there is no need of a cutoff in the model , because only the gravitational potential ( which is not divergent ) is important for the purpose of our simulations . as in",
    ", the reference frame has the origin at the galactic center and the @xmath23 and @xmath24 axes are , respectively , along the maximum and minimum axis of the triaxial ellipsoid .",
    "the centers - of - mass ( cm ) of the clusters were initially located well within the galactic core ( see table  [ initialorbits ] ) .    with regard to the df",
    ", we used the generalization to the triaxial case ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , of the chandrasekhar formula @xcite , with a self - consistent evaluation of the velocity dispersion tensor , taking also into account that the gcs are extended objects .",
    "see for more details at this regard .",
    "our numerical study involved two sets of four clusters evolved in two separate simulations .",
    "the gcs initial internal distribution was sampled from a stellar @xcite isotropic model with total mass @xmath33 , velocity parameter , the approximation being as better as the model concentration is higher ( * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath34 , limiting and `` king '' radius @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively ; @xmath37 is the concentration parameter , @xmath38^{1/2}$ ] the half - mass crossing time and @xmath39 is the central density .",
    "the ` limiting radius ' is the radius at which the king distribution function drops to zero , to reproduce the presence of the external field @xcite .",
    "the initial values of these parameters are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "each cluster was represented with @xmath40 ` particles ' , whose individual masses were assigned according to a salpeter s mass distribution ( @xmath41 ) cutted at @xmath42 and @xmath43 , with average @xmath44 , where @xmath42 is adjusted to give the desired cluster total mass ( see table [ tab1 ] ) . when simulating massive gcs , the assumption @xmath40 gives a high value of @xmath42 that shifts the chosen mass distribution in form of salpeter law towards large masses so to lose its representativity for a real gc stellar mass spectrum .",
    "however , as discussed in , we use unequal mass particles to verify that no collisional relaxation takes place during the simulation , as demanded by the 2-body relaxation time of the clusters which is in any case longer than the time to merge .",
    "actually , even for the most compact case considered here ( model  see table [ tab1 ] ) , the half - mass relaxation time of the simulated cluster is larger than the merging time @xmath45 ( see sect . [ results ] ) after which the clusters lose their individuality and evolve as a larger @xmath18 system ( see discussion in sect.[stationary ] ) the real cluster ( with a larger number of stars ) relaxation time is obviously longer than that of the simulated ( sampled ) cluster .",
    "were the gcs massive enough to decay rapidly into the galactic core , it can be safely assumed ( see also , sect .",
    "2 ) that their age at the beginning of the simulation is less than their internal 2-body relaxation time , so that mass segregation has not occurred and , thus , it was not included in the initial stellar distribution . in the following , we often refer to the system _ center - of - density _ ( cd ) ",
    "i.e. the average particle position weighted with the local density instead of the mass  as defined in @xcite . as in",
    ", in most cases we took the cd as the origin of the best suitable reference frame for the study of the internal system properties .",
    "in spite that the true conserved quantity , in absence of any external dissipation , is the center - of - mass orbital energy , it is preferable to refer to the cd orbital energy instead , because the cd identifies better the actual gc location when the outer part of the cluster is highly distorted and dispersed . defining @xmath46 as the orbital energy ( per unit mass ) of the cluster cd , its dissipation due to both the df braking effect and to the tidal interaction with the environment ,",
    "can be quantified by the following parameter : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the central galactic potential well . in fig .",
    "[ decadorb ] , @xmath49 is plotted for all the clusters in the two cases studied . the merging occurs rather quickly , as it is indicated by the snapshots of the system as projected onto one of the coordinates plane ( see fig.s  [ snap1 ] and [ snap2 ] for the case 1 ) and clearly seen from the time behaviour of the lagrangian radii of the whole system ( fig .",
    "[ rlag ] ) .",
    "lagrangian radii attain steady values at a `` merging '' time of about @xmath45 , when also the innermost radius shown stabilizes ; note , that the inner is the lagrangian radius , the later is the time at which the stable state is achieved .",
    "a similar merging time can be deduced also by the time behaviour of the distances of the clusters cd to the galactic center ( fig .  [ distance ] ) .",
    "of course , the energy dissipation rate is closely related to the prescription adopted for the evaluation and treatment of df .",
    "for instance , our evaluation could lead , in principle , to an overestimate of the effect , because we consider the cluster as a constant mass point .",
    "obviously , df would be accounted for accurately when adopting a full @xmath18-body representation of the galactic region in which gcs move ; for this reason we are running a self - consistent simulation that we will present in a forthcoming paper .",
    "however , preliminary results show a clearly _ shorter _ orbital decaying time for the same clusters of case 1 , but moving in a self - consistent representation of the same galaxy sampled by @xmath50 `` particles '' .",
    "this is shown by the time behaviour of the distance of the clusters cd from the galactic center depicted in fig.[distance_full ] , from which a merging time @xmath51 is deduced , i.e. a factor @xmath52 smaller than in the simulations with the analytic df form .",
    "this finding agrees with some recent results that show how stars stripped from the cluster by the field , but still close enough to the system , continue to contribute to mass of the decelerating system @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent fully self - consistent @xmath18-body simulations confirm that the real df effect can be even stronger that that estimated by the usual chandrasekhar formula ( probably for the further friction due to tidal effects , see * ? ? ?",
    "to study the nc morphology , we evaluated the eigenvalues @xmath53 and the eigenvectors @xmath54 of the inertia tensor @xmath55  _ k=1^n(x^k_i - x^0_i)_k=1^n(x^k_j - x^0_j ) , [ inertiatensor ] with @xmath56 being the position vector of the @xmath57-th particle , and @xmath58 the cd position . in fig .",
    "[ eigen ] , the square root of the eigenvalues are plotted as a function of time .",
    "they are evaluated considering , in eq .",
    "( [ inertiatensor ] ) , only particles closer than @xmath11 to the system cd , where @xmath11 is the half - mass radius of the nc at the end of the simulations .",
    "since @xmath59 is equal to the length of the @xmath60-th axes of the ellipsoid fitted to the matter distribution , then their ratios give a direct measure of the triaxiality of the system ; e.g. if @xmath61 then the system is spherical .",
    "it can be seen that , after the initial merging phase , the nc as a whole attains a stable configuration . only in the case 2 ( fig .",
    "[ eigen ] , upper panel ) the system shape is moderately axisymmetric ( oblate ) and , by examining the orientation of the eigenvectors , it was found to have principal axes nearly aligned to those of the galactic potential , with axial ratios @xmath62 : @xmath63 : @xmath64",
    ": @xmath52 : @xmath27 , and with @xmath65 nearly parallel to the @xmath24-axis .",
    "this alignment suggests that the final morphology is influenced , to some extent , by the galactic morphology .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that in the nc@xmath66 outskirts the stars tend , eventually , to move on orbits compatible with the underlying galactic triaxial configuration , as we will see from the velocity anisotropy ( sect .",
    "[ veldistr ] ) . nevertheless , the _ self - gravity _ of the simulated system is important enough to make the shape of the nc@xmath66 closer to a spherical configuration than the galaxy .",
    "accordingly , the configuration of the nc@xmath67 is almost spherical due to its stronger self - gravity ( fig .",
    "[ eigen ] , lower panel ) .",
    "the radial density profile of the ncs , which we have seen to be quasi - spherical at the end of the merging , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ dens ] , where , for comparison , the profile corresponding to the spatial superposition of the 4 progenitor clusters , in their initial configurations , is reported , too .",
    "this gives an immediate ` visual ' indication of the efficiency of the merging process ; the merging remnant density profile is even more concentrated than that given by the mere sum of the initial profiles of the four progenitors .",
    "actually , the merger profile has a smaller core ( showing a central density a factor @xmath26 higher ) and a more extended envelope .",
    "in fact , it is remarkably well fitted by a high - concentration ( @xmath68 ) king profile ( see fig .",
    "[ dens ] ) .",
    "this result  which agrees with what found in the different context of merging galaxies since the pioneering @xcite simulations  suggests that a sort of violent relaxation took place during the merging .",
    "this relaxation is likely due to the rapidly varying potential acting on each star of the clusters .    in the initial cluster models",
    "a stellar mass spectrum was included without mass segregation , in order to investigate possible relaxation phenomena due to either spurious collisional effects or induced by the external tidal field .",
    "the analysis of the behaviour of the average mass as a function of the distance from the center in the final nc configuration indicates _ no _ evidence of mass segregation , thus enforcing the above - mentioned hypothesis about the violent relaxation as a cause of the increased concentration of the merging product .      to compare our simulation results with observational data giving the radial profile of the line - of - sight velocity dispersion",
    ", we must evaluate the `` total '' velocity dispersion , @xmath69 , by properly accounting for the contribution of the underlying galaxy , this latter being given directly by the self - consistent model ( according to the fitting formulae [ a3 ] and [ a4 ] in ) .",
    "fig.[veldisp ] shows clearly a behaviour of @xmath69 decreasing towards the galactic center , where the surface density of the nc dominates and thus @xmath69 lowers to the velocity dispersion of the nc , which is ` colder ' than the host galactic core .",
    "the behaviour shown in fig.[veldisp ] may seem peculiar for a self - gravitating system , which normally keeps its equilibrium through a negative ( or null , if isothermal ) gradient of @xmath70 .",
    "this apparent peculiarity is due to that the central `` observed '' velocity dispersion is dominated by the nc which is not a self - gravitating system , indeed .",
    "this feature was actually found by a keck ii spectroscopic analysis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig .",
    "5 ) for most of the virgo cluster nucleated des of the sample . the same @xmath69 radial behaviour is also shown by the solution of the jeans equations for a sample of ncs observed in late - type spirals @xcite and is also deduced on the basis of direct @xmath18-body simulations by @xcite concerning gcs merging at the center of des .",
    "this latter simulation confirms the occurrence of a merging event within the central potential well of the host galaxy , even if care is due to the low number of particles that forces them to adopt a rather large gravitational smoothing radius , in order to suppress fictitious collisional effects .    as regards the velocity anisotropy , we studied the anisotropy parameters @xmath71 of the stellar velocity distribution in the ncs , as a function of the distance from the system cd , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 denote the azimuthal or the polar angle , respectively .",
    "these parameters are compared with those of the host galaxy .",
    "we have found that nc@xmath67 has a nearly isotropic velocity distribution ( @xmath74 ) , while the influence of the external galactic potential induces a @xmath75 ( i.e. @xmath76 ) in the outer region ( @xmath77 ) of the less compact nc@xmath66 , which means that the velocity distribution in the outskirts is preferentially tangential and parallel to the @xmath78 plane , as in the galactic model .",
    "noticeably , @xcite found that the @xmath69 decrease in the center of their observed nucleated de can be reproduced , in most cases , by a model having a nearly isotropic or moderately tangential velocity distribution .",
    "another relevant parameter is the central value of @xmath79 , which is proportional to the density in the phase - space .",
    "its value ( see table [ tab2 ] ) in the merged systems is smaller than that of the four individual progenitor clusters ; this corresponds to the , expected , rarefaction in the phase - space of the inner part of the system after the mutual interaction of the merging clusters and , mainly , that with the external field .",
    "this time - dependent interaction leads to a certain diffusion in phase space even if the four gcs constitute a collisionless systems .",
    "note how the rise of the central space density respect to the linear summation of individual gc densities in the case of nc@xmath66 is strongly balanced by expansion in velocity space ( @xmath80 of nc@xmath66 is @xmath81 times higher than the average velocity dispersion of the progenitors ) so to decrease for a factor @xmath82 the phase - space density .",
    "as regards the virial equilibrium of ncs , it is worth noting that the king model fitting of nc@xmath67 ( fig.[dens ] ) gives a velocity parameter @xmath83 , significantly lower than the true central value of the line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath84 .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the non negligible influence of the external galactic potential , which kinematically `` heats up '' the nc .",
    "this has an important implication on the reliability of the nc mass determination by means of the virial relation @xmath85 , with @xmath86 the projected velocity dispersion .",
    "the true mass value for our ncs is obtained with a virial parameter @xmath87 that is about 5 times lower than the usually adopted values based on the unrealistic assumption of isolated king models .",
    "this finding is in remarkable agreement with the results of @xcite on the dynamical mass estimate of ncs observed in bulge - less spiral galaxies .",
    "an important result of this work is that a quasi - stationary nc may form as merger product of orbitally decayed massive clusters . the projected density profile in the 2 cases studied here is given in fig .  [ dens ] .",
    "its similarity to the resolved nuclear profiles of many of the galaxies observed by , e.g. , @xcite is clear ; of course , the ratio between the central surface total density and that of the galaxy central plateau depends on the number of merged gcs .",
    "this ratio is @xmath88 for the four merging gcs of case 1 and @xmath89 for case 2 .",
    "an analysis of fig .",
    "4 in @xcite indicates ratios of the central luminosity and the inward extrapolated galactic luminosity in the interval @xmath90 . in the assumption that the density contrast scales linearly with",
    "the number of gcs merged ( @xmath91 ) the range of the observed ratio corresponds to the interval @xmath92 for case 1 and @xmath93 for the case 2 .",
    "of course , the linearity is not guaranteed ; actually , the modes of the merging of a more abundant sample of gcs deserves a careful , forthcoming , study .",
    "moreover , a fully self - consistent study of the feedback among the merging gcs and the surrounding stellar field is needed to confirm the modes and time of orbital decay and merging .",
    "this study will constitute a check of the reliability of the dynamical friction treatment done here in the frame of the @xcite scheme , which , if proved , will result on the possibility of saving a huge amount of cpu time in future simulations .",
    "in both the cases studied here the merging occurs at @xmath94 @xmath95 and the resulting nc keeps its characteristics almost unchanged over the remaining simulated time ( other @xmath96 @xmath95 ) .",
    "this does not imply , necessarily , the secular stationariety of the merged system , which should be investigated extending sufficiently in time the @xmath18-body simulations .",
    "anyway , simple considerations on the relaxation times convince ourselves that the lifetime of the merged system should be quite long .",
    "actually , the half mass relaxation time of the cluster is @xcite t_rh=()^1/2 ( ) ^3/2 t_b which gives @xmath97 , for the values @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 corresponding to the four merged clusters of case 1 , and @xmath101 , for the four merged clusters of case 2 , where the only different value is that of the ratio @xmath102 which results @xmath103 in this case . in physical units",
    ", this means @xmath104 gyr and @xmath105 gyr in the 2 cases , respectively , assuming @xmath106 pc and @xmath107 m@xmath3 .",
    "consequently , the merged system should stay almost stationary for a time much longer than that of our present simulations and , more relevantly , of the order of the age of galaxies , especially when thinking that the true number of stars in the system is from @xmath108 to @xmath109 times the one used in the simulations for @xmath21 in the range @xmath110@xmath111 , so to scale all the relaxation times estimated above for a factor in the range @xmath6@xmath112 . if other clusters merge to the center , @xmath18 increases , as likely @xmath11 does , increasing furtherly @xmath113 . in conclusion ,",
    "a collisional evolution for the nuclear cluster seems unlikely , but larger scale instabilities can not be ruled out .",
    "so , the dynamical evolution of the merger remnant deserves a more extended in time simulation .    in the ,",
    "likely , hipothesis that the nc keeps its stability during subsequent merging events , the central density @xmath39 growth shown by fig.[dens ] can be reasonably scaled with the number @xmath91 of merging clusters , giving @xmath114 ( case 1 ) and @xmath115 ( case 2 ) in units of the central galactic density , @xmath116 . with @xmath117 and @xmath106 pc as typical values of normal elliptical galaxies",
    ", one has @xmath118 pc@xmath9 ; consequently , for the nc to reach the high density of the order of @xmath119 pc@xmath9 , which is typical of the environment of massive accreting objects , @xmath120 ( case 1 ) and @xmath121 ( case 2 ) are needed .",
    "even with all the necessary cautions suggested by the various assumptions done , these numbers ( particularly for case 1 ) are indicating that a nc formed by merging of individual sub - structures may actually have reached central densities large enough and in a time short enough to provide mass for an efficient accretion of a possible massive galactic object , as suggested in various previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in light of this , it is clear the importance of further , more detailed and complete , study of the actual modes of formation and evolution of a nc via the merging process ( capuzzo - dolcetta & miocchi , in preparation ) .",
    "in this paper we studied the modes of interaction of a sample of few ( 4 ) globular clusters whose orbital motion is limited to the core of the galactic triaxial field , because they have experienced a significant and rapid dissipation of the orbital energy by dynamical friction acting on their large initial masses .",
    "we studied 2 sets of 4 gcs of different initial conditions , characterised by a higher ( case 1 ) and lower ( case 2 ) central density .",
    "dynamical friction was properly taken into account by the triaxial generalization of the classical chandrasekhar formula @xcite and it is the main cause of orbital energy dissipation up to the beginning of the merging process , when the individual cluster sizes are comparable with the orbital size . since this stage on , the main responsible of the residual orbital energy loss is the tidal torque .",
    "the merger is completed in @xmath122 galactic core crossing times , i.e. in a time much shorter than the hubble time and , in any case , small compared to the total orbital decaying time .",
    "the merged system keeps some of the characteristics of the preexisting objects , attaining a relaxed structure which has , in the case 2 , a mildly triaxial shape ( inherited by the environment ) and a halo which is diffusing in the external field assuming its phase space properties .",
    "the case 1 results into a merger configuration which conserves better the spherical simmetry of the progenitors  and whose radial density profile is more concentrated to the center than that expected on the basis of the mere space superposition of the 4 progenitors .",
    "this is , likely , the consequence of some violent relaxation of the merged cluster to the state of a quasi - stationary super star cluster , whose stellar density distribution maintains a king shape and is very similar to nuclear clusters observed at the center of many galaxies . even in the limits of our simulations ( both on the number of merging objects and on the time extension of the integration )",
    ", we may infer from a comparison of our results with the characteristics ( surface brightness profile , integrated light and velocity dispersion ) of the nuclei of many galaxies @xcite that such nuclei may have actually formed by the merging of few tens ( when merging progenitors are quite compact ) up to few hundreds ( when progenitors are looser ) massive gcs decayed orbitally into the inner galactic regions .    as remarkable result",
    ", the radial profile of the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the merger remnant shows the same minimum at the galactic center as actually found by observations of a sample of virgo cluster nucleated des @xcite and of late - type spirals @xcite . finally , an important theoretical result is that high densities ( @xmath123 pc@xmath9 ) , critical to allow a significant accretion onto a massive object , may be reached by mean of a merging of less than @xmath6 clusters of the type considered in case 1",
    "this may have important implications on the role of ncs in supplying the innermost galactic activity .",
    "the main computational resources employed for this work were provided by cineca ( http://www.cineca.it ) thanks to the agreement with inaf ( http://inaf.cineca.it ) under the _ key - project _ grant _ inakp002_. we thank dr .",
    "p. di matteo for providing us with her subroutine to generate multi - mass king models , used for initial conditions , and dr .",
