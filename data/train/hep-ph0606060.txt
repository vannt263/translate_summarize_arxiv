    "in the last ten years or so we have witnessed huge progress in neutrino oscillation physics . the outstanding experimental results lead to quite a clear overall picture of the neutrino sector .",
    "we know that there are two mass - squared differences separated roughly by a factor of 30 , and in the lepton mixing matrix there are two large mixing angles , and one mixing angle which has to be small . in this talk",
    "i review the present status of neutrino oscillations by reporting the results of a global analysis of latest world neutrino oscillation data from solar  @xcite , atmospheric  @xcite , reactor  @xcite , and accelerator  @xcite experiments , including the recent data from the minos long - baseline experiment  @xcite .",
    "this analysis is performed in the three - flavor framework and is based on the work published in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also the hep - ph archive version  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite for updated results ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : leading ] i discuss the determination of the leading `` solar '' and `` atmospheric '' parameters , whereas sec .",

    "[ sec : subleading ] a discussion of sub - leading effects in atmospheric data is given , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : lsnd ] i comment on attempts to reconcile the result of the lsnd experiment  @xcite with the global oscillation data .",
    "in this section i discuss the determination of the leading oscillation parameters , the `` solar '' parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and the `` atmospheric '' parameters @xmath2 , @xmath5 . in both cases we have an independent confirmation of neutrino oscillations from very different experiments , and the final allowed regions for the oscillation parameters emerge from an interplay of complementary data : the determination of the mixing angle is dominated by experiments with natural neutrino sources ( solar and atmospheric neutrinos ) , whereas the mass - squared differences are more accurately determined by man - made neutrinos ( from reactors and accelerators ) .",
    "this complementarity is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : leading ] .    details of our solar neutrino analysis can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "we use data from the homestake , sage , gno , and sk experiments  @xcite , and the sno day - night spectra from the pure d@xmath6o phase  @xcite , but the cc , nc , and es rates from the sno salt - phase are updated according to the latest 2005 data  @xcite .",
    "the predictions for the solar neutrino fluxes are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . for the kamland analysis we are using the data from ref .",
    "@xcite equally binned in @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the prompt energy deposited by the positron ) , and we include earth matter effects and flux uncertainties following ref .",
    "@xcite ( see the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : leading ] ( left ) a beautiful agreement of solar and kamland data .",
    "moreover , the complementarity of the two data sets allows a rather precise determination of the oscillation parameters : the evidence of spectral distortion in kamland data provides a strong constraint on @xmath1 , and leads to the remarkable precision of @xmath9 at @xmath10 ( compare tab .  [ tab:3nu - summary ] ) .",
    "alternative solutions around @xmath11  ev@xmath12 ( @xmath13  ev@xmath12 ) , which are still present in the kamland - only analysis at 99% c.l . , are ruled out from the combined kamland+solar analysis at about @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "in contrast to @xmath1 , the determination of the mixing angle is dominated by solar data .",
    "especially recent results from the sno experiment provide a strong upper bound on @xmath16 , excluding maximal mixing at more than @xmath15 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]             oscillations with the `` atmospheric '' parameters @xmath2 and @xmath5 have been established by the atmospheric neutrino data of sk  @xcite .",

    "the allowed region is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : leading ] ( middle ) .",
    "also in this case , by now we have an independent confirmation of the effect by experiments based on man - made neutrinos , namely the first generation of long - baseline ( lbl ) accelerator experiments exploring the @xmath17 disappearance oscillation channel . in the k2k experiment  @xcite the neutrino beam",
    "is produced at the kek proton synchrotron , and originally consists of 98% muon neutrinos with a mean energy of 1.3  gev .",
    "the @xmath17 content of the beam is observed at the sk detector at a distance of 250  km . for the k2k - i and k2k - ii data ( @xmath18  p.o.t .  in total )",
    "107 events have been detected , whereas @xmath19 have been expected for no oscillations .    recently",
    "first data ( @xmath20  p.o.t . ) from the minos experiment have been released  @xcite . a neutrino beam with @xmath21 and a mean energy of 3  gev is produced at fermilab and observed at the minos detector in the soudan mine at a distance of 735  km . in the absence of oscillations",
    "@xmath22 @xmath17 events with @xmath23  gev are expected , whereas 92 have been observed , which provides a @xmath24 evidence for disappearance . in our re - analysis",
    "we use spectral data divided into 15 bins in reconstructed neutrino energy , and our allowed region from minos - only is in very good agreement with the official result  @xcite .",
    "the values of the oscillation parameters from minos are consistent with the ones from k2k , as well as from sk atmospheric data .",
    "the impact of the data from minos in the global analysis is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : leading ] ( right ) .",
    "we find that the best fit point for @xmath5 is shifted upward from @xmath25  ev@xmath12 for sk+k2k to @xmath26  ev@xmath12 .",
    "in addition minos improves the lower bound on @xmath5 , which is increased from @xmath27  ev@xmath12 for sk+k2k to @xmath28  ev@xmath12 at @xmath29 .",
    "the relative accuracy on @xmath5 at @xmath10 is improved from 14% to 10% . as obvious from the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : leading ] the determination of @xmath2 is completely dominated by atmospheric data and there is no change due to minos .",
    "let us add that present data can not distinguish between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and hence , both , the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies provide equally good fits to the data .",
    "similar to the case of the leading oscillation parameters , also the bound on @xmath0 emerges from an interplay of different data sets , as we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : th13 ] . an important contribution to",
    "the bound comes , of course , from the chooz reactor experiment combined with the determination of @xmath5 from atmospheric and lbl experiments .",
    "however , due to a complementarity of low and high energy solar data , as well as solar and kamland data also solar+kamland provide a non - trivial constraint on @xmath0 , see e.g. , refs .",
    "we find at 90%  cl ( @xmath29 ) the following limits : @xmath32 the addition of minos data leads to a slight tightening of the constraint ( the @xmath29 limit from chooz+atm+k2k is shifted from 0.067 to 0.058 if minos is added ) because of the stronger lower bound on @xmath5 , where the chooz bound becomes weaker ( c.f.fig .",
    "[ fig : th13 ] ) .",
    "note that also the update in the solar model  @xcite leads to a small shift in the limit from solar+kamland data ( from 0.079 to 0.071 at @xmath29 ) .",
    "both of these updates contribute to the change of the global bound from 0.046  @xcite to 0.041 at @xmath29 .     from the interplay of the global data.,scaledwidth=38.0% ]",
    "in principle one expects that at some level sub - leading effects will show up in atmospheric neutrinos , involving oscillations with @xmath4 or effects of a finite @xmath0 , see e.g. , refs .",
    "an excess of @xmath33-like events observed in sk  @xcite might be a possible hint for such effects , and in refs .",
    "@xcite a slight preference for non - maximal values of @xmath34 has been found .",
    "in contrast , the sk analysis presented in ref .  @xcite did not confirm that hint .     in the plane @xmath35-@xmath36 from various sk data samples , taking into account oscillations with @xmath37  ev@xmath12.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    from a full three - flavor analysis of sk data  @xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : th13-th23 ] one finds that indeed sub - gev data prefer a value @xmath34 , however , if only multi - gev data is used the best fit occurs for @xmath38 .",
    "summing sub- and multi - gev data leads incidentally to a cancellation of both effects and the best fit occurs very close to maximal mixing . finally , using all data including sub - gev , multi - gev , stopping and through - going @xmath39-like data , the best fit moves again to @xmath40  @xcite . from these considerations",
    "we conclude that the final result for @xmath2 appears as a delicate interplay of different data samples , involving cancellations of opposite trends .",
    "hence the result is rather sensitive to the very fine details of the analysis .",
    "let us stress that the @xmath41 contours shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : th13-th23 ] correspond to 9.5% , 22% , 39% , and 90%  cl ( 2 d.o.f . ) , i.e. , there is no significance in these effects .",
    "the purpose of this analysis is to show that present data does not allow to obtain statistically meaningful indications of non - maximal values of @xmath2 nor of non - zero values of @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , sub - leading three - flavor effects in atmospheric oscillations can be explored in future mt scale water erenkov  @xcite or magnetized iron calorimeter  @xcite experiments , and may provide complementary information to lbl experiments .     from chooz+atm+k2k data on the details of the atmospheric neutrino analysis .",
    "the curves ( from top to bottom in the legend ) correspond to _",
    "( i ) _ the analysis of ref .",

    "( vii ) _ the analysis from ref .",
    "@xcite.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : th13-atm ] illustrates how details of the atmospheric neutrino analysis affect the bound on @xmath36 from chooz+atm+k2k data .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the inclusion of three - flavor effects ( from @xmath0 and/or @xmath4 ) , as well as different treatments of systematics lead to an `` uncertainty '' of about 16% on the bound on @xmath36 at @xmath42 , as indicated by the `` error bar '' in the figure .",
    "note that the shifts of the global @xmath0 limit due to minos or changes in the solar neutrino analysis reported in sec .",
    "[ sec : th13 ] are at the same level as this uncertainty from details in the atmospheric neutrino analysis .",
    "to reconcile the lsnd evidence  @xcite for @xmath43 oscillations with @xmath44  ev@xmath12 is a long - standing problem for neutrino phenomenology , and the community is eagerly waiting for an experimental answer to this problem from the miniboone experiment  @xcite .",
    "the three required mass - squared differences can be obtained in four - neutrino mass schemes , but such models can not accommodate the constraints on the mixing  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an updated analysis ) : mass schemes of the ( 2 + 2 ) type predict that a large fraction of the sterile neutrino participates in solar and/or atmospheric neutrino oscillations , which in both cases is disfavored by the data  @xcite , and therefore such schemes are ruled out at more than @xmath15  cl .",
    "the ( 3 + 1 ) mass spectra are in perfect agreement with solar and atmospheric data , however , they suffer from a tension between the lsnd signal and null - result short - baseline disappearance experiments  @xcite , most importantly bugey  @xcite and cdhs  @xcite , which disfavors these models at the @xmath29 level .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a five - neutrino mass scheme of the type ( 3 + 2 ) has been considered to avoid these constraints , and it is claimed that the disagreement measured by the so - called parameter goodness - of - fit  @xcite is improved from 0.032% for ( 3 + 1 ) to 2.1% .",
    "however , it should be noted that , apart from possible severe conflicts with constraints from cosmology , the best fit point found in ref .",
    "@xcite seems to be disfavored also from atmospheric neutrino data . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite atmospheric neutrinos provide a constraint on a parameter @xmath45 , denoting the fraction of @xmath17 which does not participate in oscillations with @xmath46 . in the ( 3 + 2 ) scheme",
    "this parameter is given by @xmath47 , @xmath48 one finds @xmath49 . as visible from fig .",
    "[ fig : d_mu ] this value leads to a @xmath50 from atmospheric+k2k data , and hence seems to be disfavored at the @xmath51 level .",
    "therefore , a re - analysis of the ( 3 + 2 ) scenario including the constraint from atmospheric data seems to be required to judge the viability of this model .     from atm+k2k data from ref .",
    "@xcite compared to the best fit prediction of the ( 3 + 2 ) neutrino mass scheme  @xcite.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    in view of these difficulties to explain the lsnd result with neutrino oscillations several alternative mechanisms have been proposed , see ref .",
    "@xcite for references .",
    "in addition to the fact that some of them involve very speculative physics , many of these proposals have also phenomenological problems to accommodate all constraints . scenarios which seem to be in agreement with all present data are a model with a decaying sterile neutrino  @xcite , a four - neutrino mass scheme plus cpt violation  @xcite , and a model based on sterile neutrinos and large extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "in this talk i have summarized the status of neutrino oscillations with may 2006 , providing updated best fit values and allowed ranges of the three - flavor neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "the impact of the recently released first data from minos on the determination of @xmath5 as well as on the bound on @xmath0 has been investigated .",
    "furthermore , sub - leading effects in atmospheric neutrino data have been discussed , stressing that hints for non - maximal values of @xmath2 and/or non - zero values of @xmath0 depend on the fine details of the analysis and are not statistically significant . in view of the upcoming results from miniboone",
