    "although it is widely assumed that brown dwarfs represent the low - mass extension of normal star formation @xcite , many of the details are not clear . one theoretical problem is to explain the existence of objects much smaller than the typical jeans mass of a parent cloud ( @xmath11 ) , especially in light of reports of objects with masses @xmath12 @xcite . in particular ,",
    "a possible proto brown dwarf of mass @xmath13 has been reported by @xcite , although this finding has been refuted by @xcite . in principle , such objects could be produced by the fragmentation of protostellar cores , which can collapse gravitationally provided there is sufficient radiative cooling to overcome gas pressure .",
    "the lower mass limit for this to occur is believed to be @xmath14 @xmath15 , irrespective of the details of the fragmentation process @xcite .",
    "disks may play a significant role , either by gravitational fragmentation of single disks @xcite , or by encounters between disks @xcite .",
    "one potential difficulty with any of these models is that even if low mass objects are produced initially , subsequent accretion from the infalling cloud will increase the final mass of the object .",
    "this led @xcite to propose the ` ejected stellar embryo ' model whereby the lowest - mass members of a multiple system are ejected due to dynamical instability before they can accrete sufficient material to begin hydrogen burning .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of small stellar clusters suggest that dynamical interactions play a key role in the formation of not only brown dwarfs , but stars in general @xcite .",
    "observational estimates of the mass function provide important constraints on the above models .",
    "such information can be gained using data from deep imaging of star formation regions at multiple wavelengths . because brown dwarfs emit most of their radiation at wavelengths longward of 1 @xmath3 m , the near infrared is particularly conducive to their detection ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "such data can be compared with the spectral predictions of evolutionary models , enabling preliminary estimation of physical parameters such as mass and temperature .",
    "one model of interest is the dust - free  cond \" model of @xcite , which assumes that the dust grains have settled below the photosphere .",
    "it thus represents one extreme with respect to the absorption of photospheric radiation by dust , and is applicable to the  methane dwarfs \" whose temperatures are @xmath16 k. at the other extreme is the  dusty \" model @xcite , applicable to brown dwarfs at higher temperatures , in which the photospheric dust stays at its formation site in the atmosphere .",
    "the @xmath0 oph cloud core is a suitable site for the study of young brown dwarfs due to its youth , high rate of low - mass star formation and its relative proximity ; recent estimates of its distance are @xmath17 pc @xcite and @xmath18 pc @xcite .",
    "we assume a distance of 124 pc , representing a weighted average of these estimates .",
    "the main cloud , l1688 , is approximately @xmath19 pc in extent and contains a substantial number ( @xmath20 ) of low - mass stars @xcite whose estimated age is @xmath14 myr @xcite . here",
    "we describe the results of deep imaging of a dense portion of this cloud at multiple wavelengths in the near - infrared and explore the implications for brown dwarf formation models .",
    "our dataset includes the deep @xmath1 and @xmath2 images from the @xmath0 oph calibration field of the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) extended mission @xcite that were produced by combining 1582 observations made between 1997 and 2000 during the course of the main survey @xcite .",
    "the result is a set of high dynamic range images in which the sensitivity has been increased by 3.54.5 magnitudes over that of the main survey .",
    "the 2mass 90009 field , of size @xmath21 , centered at @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( j2000 ) , covers part of the @xmath0 oph cloud core , and has limiting magnitudes ( at the 5 @xmath5 level ) of 20.5 , 20.0 , and 19.0 at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . some additional information on the 2mass calibration fields , and on this field in particular , is given by @xcite .",
    "we supplement these images with archival data at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath3 m from irac @xcite on the _ spitzer _ space telescope @xcite , based on observations made in 2004 apr 27may 7 as part of the c2d legacy project @xcite .",
    "the archival bcd images were reprocessed to correct for artifacts ( including saturation , column pulldown , muxbleed ,  jailbar \" effects , instrumental background and pixel - value outliers ) and mosaicked using the _ spitzer _ science center mopex software .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the relationship of the observed field to an extinction map of the cloud core . for comparison purposes",
    ", the field has been divided into  cloud \" and  exterior \" regions .",
    "the lower boundary of the  cloud \" region was chosen to coincide with the @xmath24 mag contour of @xcite , at @xmath25 .",
    "our  exterior \" region was chosen to extend southward from declination @xmath26 , wherein @xmath27 mag .",
    "the two regions are therefore defined as follows :    _ exterior : _",
    "= @xmath28 = @xmath29 + @xmath30    the image data from all seven bands were interpolated onto a common pixel - grid with a sampling interval of @xmath31 , spatially coincident with the 2mass images . during this procedure ,",
    "spitzer _ images were co - registered with the 2mass images by matching the positions of bright stars , achieving a band - to - band registration accuracy of @xmath32 .",
    "these images were then processed using our multiphot profile - fitting source extraction procedure ( marsh & cutri 2010 , in preparation ) , which represents the multiband extension of the algorithm used for profile - fitting photometry in 2mass .",
    "a key aspect is that the detection step and the source parameter estimation step are both done using the data at all bands simultaneously , thereby avoiding the ambiguities involved in bandmerging in crowded fields .",
    "the parameter estimation step represents a maximum likelihood solution to the source position ( @xmath33 ) and the set of multiband fluxes , taking into account the measurement noise and point spread function ( psf ) at each wavelength .",
    "it provides a set of reduced chi squared values ( for each band individually and an overall value ) for testing the hypothesis that the data are consistent with a point source or a blend consisting of a small number of closely - spaced point sources .",
    "the noise model itself includes the effects of instrumental noise in the pixel values , psf uncertainty , and uncertainty due to confusion error .",
    "the resulting derived error bars for flux and position are believed to represent a realistic assessment of the uncertainties in those quantities .",
    "care was taken to minimize any systematic effects in band - to - band flux calibration which would compromise the analysis of seds , including an assessment of the effects of confusion . based on the relatively dilute field ( on average , about 50 resolution elements per source ) and the accurate band - to - band registration of the images discussed above , we are confident that the flux variations across bands ( and , in particular , the 2mass - spitzer colors ) are well - determined .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows color - magnitude diagrams ( @xmath34 versus @xmath9 and @xmath2 versus @xmath10 ) for the @xmath0 oph cloud region , and also for the region exterior to the cloud for comparison ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) . for both band / color combinations , the  cloud \" and  exterior",
    "\" plots are clearly quite different ; the plots for the exterior region are consistent with relatively unobscured background stars , whereas the plots for the cloud region are consistent with stars at a wide range of visual obscurations .    for the @xmath34 versus @xmath9 plot of the cloud region , it is also evident that for most of the @xmath34 apparent magnitude range , the leftmost edge of the set of @xmath9 values is separated from the 1 myr isochrone of the cond model by about 10 magnitudes of visual extinction , consistent with the star - forming cluster being embedded in the cloud at a depth corresponding to this opacity . however , for @xmath35 mag , this  minimum extinction \" edge turns blueward , reaching zero extinction at @xmath36 mag .",
    "a similar blueward skew is apparent for the corresponding @xmath2 versus @xmath10 plot .",
    "we believe this effect is real since it is substantially larger than the observational error bars and is not evident for sources exterior to the cloud , as is apparent from figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is also not an artifact of the profile - fitting source extraction process because the same blueward skew is evident when the extraction is repeated using aperture photometry via daophot @xcite .",
    "the aperture photometry results are not plotted here , but can be accessed via @xcite .",
    "if the extracted sources were all members of the star - forming cluster in the @xmath0 oph cloud at 124 pc , then the faintest sources would correspond to low - mass brown dwarfs according to the cond model .",
    "it is likely , however , that many of the sources are external to the cloud and represent other types of object along the line of sight .",
    "possibilities for the latter are more distant background stars , foreground t dwarfs , and extragalactic objects such as agn .",
    "the first of those possibilities is suggested by previous measurements of the @xmath37-band luminosity function of the cloud core region , which is dominated by background stars for @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "such objects would be most visible near the less - extincted edges of the cloud .",
    "could they then account for the blueward skew seen in the color - magnitude diagrams of figure [ fig2 ] ?",
    "the answer is no , because any low - extinction window in the field would admit background stars over a wide range of magnitudes , and no blueward - turning edge would result .    in order to separate brown dwarfs from background stars",
    "we exploit the fact that these two classes of object are characterized by different color temperatures .",
    "accordingly , we have fitted a temperature to each of the extracted sources from our multiband photometry .",
    "the technique , described in the next section , does not presume cluster membership _ a priori_.",
    "we have estimated the effective temperature , @xmath7 , of each extracted source based on a least squares fit of model spectra to the observed seds .",
    "the following suite of models was considered :    * cond @xcite for an assumed age of 1 myr . * dusty @xcite for the same assumed age . * nextgen @xcite for stars of solar gravity and solar metallicity .",
    "we have restricted these fits to five of our seven wavebands , namely @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 $ ] because of their close wavelength correspondence with published cond and dusty model results at the @xmath41 and @xmath42 bands .",
    "this restriction does not negatively impact the temperature estimates since the sensitivity of irac at 5.8 and 8 @xmath3 m is significantly less than for the shorter - wavelength bands .",
    "in addition , the photospheric fluxes at 5.8 and 8 @xmath3 m are , in some cases , significantly contaminated by dust emission from circumstellar disks @xcite .    for each hypothesized model , the procedure consisted of minimizing a function @xmath43 with respect to @xmath7 , a flux scaling factor , @xmath44 , and the visual absorption , @xmath45 , based on a functional form given by : @xmath46 ^ 2 - \\beta a_v \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 represent the observed and model fluxes , respectively , at the wavelength band represented by index @xmath49 ; @xmath50 represents flux uncertainty ; @xmath51 represents the absorption in band @xmath49 relative to @xmath45 , based on the reddening law from @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath52 is a constant whose significance we now discuss .",
    "the 2nd term on the right hand side of ( [ eq1 ] ) is designed to compensate for spurious biases towards low @xmath7 values resulting from the potential presence of long - wavelength excesses due to circumstellar dust .",
    "it is necessitated by the increasing degeneracy which exists between @xmath7 and @xmath45 as the temperature increases and the rayleigh - jeans regime is approached .",
    "because of this degeneracy , the sed of a high - temperature object with large extinction can be reproduced equally well by a model based on a low - temperature object seen though small extinction .",
    "for such an object , the presence of even a relatively small long - wavelength excess due to circumstellar dust can favor a spurious low - temperature solution . to compensate for this effect",
    ", we have imposed a penalty against low values of @xmath45 , whose severity is controlled by the value of @xmath52 .",
    "we have optimized the value of @xmath52 using published photometry for a large number of spectroscopically - confirmed brown dwarfs of a variety of ages , as discussed in appendix 1 ; the optimal value was found to be 0.7 .",
    "this optimization incorporated the results of our own spectroscopic observations of 7 of the objects in our @xmath0 oph source extraction list @xcite .    in evaluating @xmath53 ,",
    "the model fluxes were calculated by logarithmic interpolation of the tabulated model fluxes with respect to @xmath7 and wavelength .",
    "the wavelength interpolation was necessitated by the mismatch between the observational wavebands ( the _ spitzer _ 3.6 @xmath3 m and 4.5 @xmath3 m bands ) and the @xmath54 and @xmath42 bands for which the model photometry was tabulated .",
    "although the wavelength mismatches are relatively small , some errors in the interpolation are inevitable .",
    "to assess this , we took some individual high resolution spectra from the cond models and smoothed them with the 2mass and _ spitzer _ bandpasses and found that @xmath55 $ ] was accurately reproduced ( to within 0.1 mag or better ) but that @xmath56 $ ] was less so , particularly at the lowest temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , given the other errors involved in the temperature estimation procedure , we have found that this interpolation error is a relatively minor contributor .    for a given model , @xmath7",
    "was restricted to the nominal range of physical validity , corresponding to @xmath57 k ( cond ) , @xmath58 ( dusty ) , or @xmath59 k ( nextgen ) . for each extracted source , the estimates of @xmath7 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45",
    "were then based on the model which gave the minimum value of @xmath53 .",
    "such estimates were made for all sources detected in at least 4 of the 5 bands .",
    "solutions which gave a poor fit , as indicated by a large value of reduced chi squared ( @xmath60 ) , were excluded .",
    "a total of 1022 successful fits was thereby obtained for the  cloud \" region , representing 97% of the extracted sources .",
    "in particular it was found that the predicted spectral peculiarities of low temperature brown dwarfs ( @xmath61 k ) were well fit by the observations .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows some sample model fits to the dereddened fluxes , with estimated @xmath7 values as indicated .",
    "the temperature fitting procedure was repeated for the  exterior \" region .",
    "this region was not covered by the 3.6 @xmath3 m observations and was incomplete at 4.5 @xmath3 m , as can be seen from figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "nevertheless , temperature fitting was still possible with relatively little loss of accuracy .",
    "a total of 684 successful fits was thereby obtained , representing 100% of the extracted sources .",
    "this is comparable to the number of fits obtained for the  cloud \" region even though the area of sky was substantially smaller .",
    "we verified that the lack of 3.5 @xmath3 m data did not cause any systematic effects by repeating the  cloud \" analysis without the 3.5 @xmath3 m data .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows plots of dereddened @xmath2 flux as a function of estimated temperature for the  cloud \" and  exterior \" regions .",
    "also shown are the model curves for the cond and dusty models ( age 1 myr ) and main sequence stars for an assumed distance of 124 pc .",
    "comparison of the two plots in figure [ fig4 ] shows that the number of points which fall on or close to the cond / dusty model curves is much greater on the  cloud \" plot than on the  exterior \" plot , consistent with the presence of brown dwarfs in the cloud core region .",
    "it is also apparent that the majority of points in the  exterior \" plot correspond to @xmath62 k and are below the main sequence line for a distance of 124 pc .",
    "they are therefore consistent with normal stars at distances larger than 124 pc .",
    "the same population is evident in the  cloud \" plot , and hence the points which fall below the main sequence line on that plot can confidently be identified as background stars .",
    "they number 882 and 666 in the  cloud \" and  exterior \" regions , respectively .",
    "after exclusion of those objects we are left with @xmath63 cluster member candidates in the  cloud \" region and @xmath64 in the  exterior \" region .",
    "this set of candidates may still , however , contain non - cluster contaminants .",
    "possibilities include :    * foreground l and t dwarfs . * extragalactic objects such as agn .",
    "* main sequence background stars whose temperatures have been underestimated and which have therefore been incorrectly assigned to the brown dwarf regime in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the likelihood of foreground contamination by l and t dwarfs can be assessed from available number density statistics given that the volume of space in the cone capped by our  cloud \" region is 54 pc@xmath65 . since the estimated space densities of l and t dwarfs in the solar neighborhood are @xmath66 pc@xmath67 in both cases ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the corresponding expectation numbers within this region are @xmath68 for both object types .",
    "this is consistent with estimates of the @xmath69 magnitude - limited sky density of t dwarfs @xcite which would suggest @xmath68 - 1.0 such objects in a region of this size .",
    "we therefore conclude that the number of low-@xmath7 foreground objects in the  cloud \" region is relatively small .",
    "we can obtain an upper limit to the number of extragalactic contaminants by assuming that all of the inferred cluster members in the  exterior \" region are spurious .",
    "we can then predict the number of contaminating sources in the  cloud \" region by scaling @xmath70 by the cloud : exterior background source count ratio , equal to 1.32 from the background source counts estimated above . on this basis ,",
    "an upper limit for the number of non - cluster members included in @xmath71 is 24 , i.e. of our 139 cluster member candidates , the percentage of contaminating sources is between 0 and 17% .",
    "a particularly interesting subset of the cluster member candidates in figure [ fig4 ] is the group of low-@xmath7 objects ( @xmath72 k ) , of which there are 11 in the  cloud \" region  these are most likely low - mass brown dwarfs .",
    "by contrast , there is only 1 such object in the  exterior \" region .",
    "the fact that the number of low-@xmath7 objects decreases so sharply when going from  cloud \" to  exterior \" supports their inferred cluster membership and argues strongly against their being extragalactic .",
    "even the 1 low-@xmath7 object in the  exterior \" region could be a foreground t dwarf based on the statistics quoted earlier .",
    "we therefore consider it unlikely that any of our low - mass brown dwarf candidates are extragalactic background sources . presumably , the latter are shielded from the observed field by dust in the galactic disk .",
    "is it possible that we have underestimated the background contamination due to the fact that background sources in the  cloud \" region are much more heavily reddened than those in the  exterior \" region ?",
    "for example , do highly reddened agn resemble brown dwarfs when viewed through the cloud ? to test this , we have simulated the effect of viewing the  exterior \" region through a dense dust cloud and have repeated our temperature fits using the artificially reddened data .",
    "we found that no value of applied @xmath45 could produce a significant population of brown dwarf false - positives , and therefore conclude that the majority of our brown dwarf candidates in the  cloud \" region can not be attributed to reddened background objects .",
    "having excluded the various classes of possible background objects on the above basis , we are left with a total of 165 candidate cluster members in the entire observed field , of which 92 are brown dwarf candidates .",
    "these 165 objects represent the sum of the number of objects in the cloud region ( 139 ) , exterior region ( 18 ) , and the gap between those two regions ( 8) . the photometric results for the candidate cluster members are presented in table [ tbl-1 ] , and the locations of all detected sources ( observed in at least 4 bands ) are plotted in figure [ fig5 ] . in the latter ,",
    "red and green symbols denote candidate cluster members and background stars , respectively . also shown for comparison on the plot",
    "are our estimated contours of visual absorption , @xmath45 ; these were obtained by dividing the field of view into square cells of size @xmath73 , finding the maximum value of @xmath45 for all stars falling into a given cell , and interpolating using a gaussian convolution kernel .",
    "the fact that the background source density in figure [ fig5 ] is highest ( by far ) in the off - cloud region provides validation of our classification criterion for background stars .",
    "likewise , the fact that the low - mass ( @xmath74 ) brown dwarf candidates ( filled red circles ) are concentrated mostly in the cloud portion provides some confirmation of their identity as cluster members .",
    "color - magnitude plots for the candidate cluster members are shown in panels ( a)-(c ) of figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "also shown , for comparison , in the @xmath2 versus @xmath56 $ ] plot of panel ( c ) are the locations of the inferred background stars .",
    "since the @xmath56 $ ] color is quite temperature - sensitive in the brown dwarf regime , the distributions of brown dwarfs and background stars are distinctly different on this plot .",
    "the fact that the blueward skew is still evident in the @xmath75 plots of ( a ) and ( b ) indicates that it is associated with objects in the @xmath0 oph cloud , most likely brown dwarfs .",
    "the well - defined portion of the blueward skew has been delineated by the dashed lines on the plot ; the objects which fall within this zone have been plotted as open circles in the @xmath9 versus @xmath10 color - color diagram of panel ( d ) . the fact that the colors are positively correlated on this plot ( i.e. , blue @xmath9 corresponds to blue @xmath10 ) confirms that the blueward skew is not a random effect caused by increasing measurement errors .",
    "does the blueward skew then indicate a deficiency in the models ?",
    "this is unlikely , since the cond model is based on a dust - free photosphere and thus already produces relatively blue colors .",
    "a more likely explanation is that the faintest sources are seen with the least extinction .",
    "this could occur if the lowest - mass brown dwarfs are preferentially ejected from their formation sites and some are therefore seen closer to the front edge of the cloud along the line of sight .",
    "such behavior would , in fact , be expected on the basis of the ` ejected stellar embryo ' hypothesis , although models which involve ejection subsequent to the accretion phase would not be excluded .",
    "an additional feature of the color - magnitude diagrams in figure [ fig6 ] is the dip in density of points around @xmath76 .",
    "similar drops at comparable magnitudes have been found for other young clusters and star - forming regions @xcite . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "this phenomenon is yet to be understood , but it may be related to the deficit in m7 and m8 objects noted by @xcite .",
    "the temperature estimates can be used to infer a mass for each object in the  cloud \" region , based on the assumed age . for those objects which were fit by the cond or dusty model",
    ", each temperature then corresponds to a unique model - based mass . for the hotter objects , which were best fit by nextgen , we used a mass - temperature relationship derived from observations by @xcite of pre - main sequence objects in the @xmath0 oph cloud .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows a plot of @xmath45 versus mass , @xmath42 , from which it can be seen that for @xmath77 , the minimum extinction for a given mass is positively correlated with the mass , reaching zero extinction for @xmath78 ( 3 jupiter masses ) .",
    "no conclusion can be drawn for masses below about 0.001 @xmath79 , however , since sources with significant extinction would be below the @xmath80 sensitivity limits for that mass range .",
    "the estimated mass function itself is plotted as a histogram in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "sources of error in this plot include errors in mass estimation and misclassification as discussed in section 5 .",
    "the results given in the appendix suggest that mass values have been estimated to an accuracy of a factor of @xmath81 .",
    "the dashed line in the plot represents an estimate of the mass function based on the assumption that all inferred cluster members are genuine .",
    "we have corrected this result for likely contamination by foreground and background objects by making use of the results from the  exterior \" region , assuming that all inferred cluster members in that region are spurious .",
    "specifically , we constructed a separate mass function for the  exterior \" region , scaled it by the cloud : exterior background source count ratio ( 1.32 ) estimated in section 5 , and subtracted the scaled histogram from the mass function of the  cloud \" region .",
    "the result is indicated by the solid line in the figure .",
    "the mass function , within the limits of uncertainty indicated in figure [ fig8 ] , is consistent with the relatively flat distribution found previously in @xmath0 oph for masses in excess of a few hundredths of a solar mass @xcite , but departs significantly from this behavior for lower masses .",
    "specifically , our results suggest an order of magnitude increase in the number of objects at @xmath82 with respect to that at @xmath83",
    ". the actual increase may be even larger than this , however ; since some parts of the cloud have @xmath45 in excess of 100 magnitudes ( see figure [ fig7 ] ) , we may be missing some low - mass objects more deeply embedded in the cloud .",
    "the apparent flattening - out of the distribution below 0.002 @xmath79 is probably due to the sensitivity cutoff of the observations , as suggested by figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility of an actual cutoff in the mass distribution .    our inferred mass function is consistent with that found for @xmath5 orionis @xcite based on broad - band sed information using techniques somewhat similar to those used here .",
    "they similarly found an order - of - magnitude increase in the mass function between 0.1 and 0.006 @xmath79 ; the @xcite results have been overplotted on our figure [ fig8 ] for comparison .",
    "in addition @xcite found a possible hint of a turnover at @xmath84 @xmath79 , also reminiscent of figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "we have cross checked our results against previous work by searching published lists of spectroscopically confirmed brown dwarfs in the @xmath0 oph cloud core region , but could only find one such case within our field .",
    "this is gy 204 , listed by @xcite as an m6 brown dwarf with a temperature of 2700 k and a mass of 4080 @xmath15 .",
    "it coincides with object # 60 in table 1 for which we had estimated @xmath85 k and a mass of @xmath86 , in agreement with the spectroscopic observation .",
    "we were able to match the majority of the brighter cluster member candidates to previously - known sources ; for the 57 cluster - member candidates brighter than @xmath87 , all but one corresponded to objects listed in the simbad database .",
    "of those 56 , all were consistent with being young objects associated with the @xmath0 oph cloud .",
    "this provides some additional confidence in the assigned cluster membership .",
    "our results suggest that the mass function for the @xmath0 oph cloud core is similar to that of another young cluster , @xmath5 orionis @xcite .",
    "a key feature is the increasing abundance with decreasing mass ; this may be a consequence of the fragmentation of larger star - forming cores .",
    "the distributions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 colors for the lowest - mass objects ( @xmath88 ) show a progressive blueward skew with decreasing flux , which we interpret in terms of decreasing dust extinction with decreasing mass .",
    "that is not to say that all low - mass objects have low extinction , but rather that _ some _ of them make it out to the front edge of the cloud where we see them unextincted .",
    "such behavior might be expected based on models in which the lowest - mass members of the cluster have been dynamically ejected from a formation site deep in the cloud .",
    "it is consistent with the timescales involved ; dynamical simulations suggest brown dwarf ejection velocities of the order of a few km s@xmath89 @xcite , adequate to traverse the @xmath0 oph main cloud , of size @xmath142 pc @xcite , within the assumed 1 myr age of the cloud .",
    "the spatial distribution of our low - mass ( @xmath90 ) brown dwarf candidates is distinctly different from that of the higher - mass t tauri stars and ysos , as shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "one of the key differences is that , surprisingly , the low - mass candidates are _ less _ dispersed than the t tauri stars , contrary to the expectations of the ejection model .",
    "another key difference is that most of the low - mass candidates are concentrated in the northernmost of the two dust filaments in this field ( @xmath91 ) and are absent from the southern filement ( @xmath92 ) , even though the latter contains a somewhat higher concentration of t tauri stars .",
    "this contrasts with the findings of @xcite , whose study of the taurus star - forming region indicated no significant difference between the distributions of stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "the situation is , however , somewhat reminiscent of spatial segregation effects in taurus found by @xcite , whereby brown dwarfs with disks are preferentially located in one particular filament ; no such segregation was evident for the t tauri stars . since the presence of a disk suggests youth , the spatial segregation might be interpreted in terms of age differences between different aggregates of objects in the region . similarly , in the case of @xmath0 oph , the relatively compact aggregate of low - mass candidates in the northern filament in figure [ fig5 ] may have resulted from a star formation event more recent than for some or all of the t tauri stars .",
    "therefore , the spatial compactness of the low - mass aggregate does not necessarily argue against the ejection model .",
    "@xcite have recently compared our photometry with their own data , obtained in 2006 , for the subset of 7 sources observed spectroscopically by @xcite , and found discrepancies in 3 cases . in particular , they found # 4450 to be 1.42 magnitudes fainter than our estimate of @xmath93 .",
    "after further examination of our images , we find the source to be slightly extended , with fwhm @xmath94 .",
    "its estimated flux will therefore depend to some extent on the aperture or beamsize used .",
    "we have estimated its @xmath2-band aperture magnitude from the 2mass deep field data using apertures of various radii , making appropriate corrections for truncation of the point - source response , and obtain @xmath95 in a @xmath96 aperture .",
    "we have compared this result with that obtained from the @xmath37-band  peak - up \" image during the spectroscopic observations of @xcite , which yield @xmath97 for a @xmath96 aperture ; the image was unfortunately too noisy for larger apertures .",
    "the two magnitudes are nevertheless consistent within the error bars , and therefore suggest the absence of any significant source variability over the intervening @xmath98-year time span .",
    "there remains a significant discrepancy with the value @xmath99 estimated by @xcite , but we suspect that the difference can be attributed to the smaller effective beamsize ( @xmath100 ) in the latter observations , which could lead to flux underestimation for an extended source . object # 4450 is not unique in this regard  we have found a number of other cases in which our sources are slightly extended , and hypothesize that we may be seeing the effects of scattering from remnant infalling dust envelopes surrounding the brown dwarf candidates . it is not clear what , if any , effect such cases would have on our temperature estimates , but we note that our sed fit for # 4450 yielded an effective temperature in complete agreement with the spectroscopic value from @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are based on fits to broad - band seds which are subject to the uncertainties that we have discussed .",
    "verification must await spectroscopic observations in order to confirm the nature of individual objects and to better constrain their parameters .",
    "nevertheless , sed fitting can play an important role in gathering statistics over wider areas of the sky , which is important to do because the mass function is known to vary from region to region  between different star - forming clouds @xcite and even within the same cloud @xcite .",
    "such studies will be aided by upcoming surveys , particularly the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) in conjunction with shorter - wavelength data from the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) and the visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista ) .",
    "additional complementary data , consisting of optical and far - red photometry , will soon be available from the pan - starrs-1 and sky - mapper survey telescopes , and will cover a larger area of sky than ukidss and vista .",
    "we thank the referee for helpful comments and suggestions .",
    "we also thank tim thompson for making the irac mosaic images , and john stauffer and luisa rebull for helpful discussions .",
    "the research utilized data products from 2mass , a joint project of the university of massachussetts and ipac / caltech , and also archival data from _ spitzer",
    "_ , operated by jpl / caltech under contract to nasa .",
    "use was also made of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
    "the work was carried out at ipac / caltech and was supported by a grant from the nasa astrophysics data analysis program .",
    "we have evaluated the performance of our model - fitting procedure using photometric data for cases of spectroscopically - confirmed brown dwarfs and young stellar objects taken from the literature .",
    "our selection criteria were :      the selected data then consisted of 4- or 5-band photometric measurements of 84 field brown dwarfs ( ages 0.210 gyr ) , 25 young brown dwarfs ( ages @xmath1410 myr ) , the 7 young objects in @xmath0 oph observed by @xcite , and all 8 of the 56 cross - identified simbad objects for which a spectral type was available .",
    "our model fitting procedure was run on these data in a manner identical to that used in section 4 , i.e. , a maximum likelihood fit to three unknowns ( @xmath7 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) using the same assumed age ( 1 myr ) for the cond and dusty models . in each case , the sed - estimated temperatures were compared with the published spectroscopic values . in cases for which the latter had not been specified , it was inferred from the published spectral type using figure 7 of @xcite .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ fig9 ] , the top panel of which shows the results obtained without the use of the @xmath45 constraint discussed in section 4 , i.e. , @xmath103 .",
    "the rms difference between the estimated and spectroscopic values of @xmath104 for that case was 0.18 , corresponding to a percentage error of 51% in the estimated value of @xmath7 .",
    "we have optimized @xmath52 by minimizing the rms difference in @xmath104 as a function of @xmath52 . in varying @xmath52 from 0 to 1.5",
    ", we find that the rms difference goes through a well - defined minimum of 41% at @xmath105 , and back up to 51% again ; accordingly we select @xmath105 as the optimum value .",
    "the middle panel in figure [ fig9 ] shows the result .",
    "it is apparent that without the @xmath45 constraint , 6 of the 7 @xcite objects would have been incorrectly assigned temperatures below 2000 k. a corresponding plot of our @xmath45 estimates versus the previously published values , where available , is shown in figure [ fig10 ] .    in order to assess the sensitivity of our temperature estimation technique to the degree of extinction",
    ", we have artificially reddened the data by various amounts and repeated the estimation procedure .",
    "we find that the applied extinction produces very little perturbation in estimated temperature . as an example",
    ", the bottom panel of figure [ fig9 ] shows the effect of an applied @xmath45 of 50 mag .    for each estimated temperature",
    ", the models provide a corresponding mass which can be compared with the spectroscopically - estimated mass .",
    "for the young brown dwarfs , the rms difference in log mass ( @xmath106 ) between our estimates and previous spectroscopic determinations was 0.41 , corresponding to an average error of a factor of @xmath81 in mass estimation .",
    "comparison between the uncertainties in @xmath7 , @xmath45 in table 1 and the scatter in these corresponding quantities in figure [ fig9 ] indicates that the true uncertainties are much larger than the formal errors of maximum likelihood estimation .",
    "the reason is that the latter represents the effect of random noise and does not take into account various sources of model error , which includes uncertainties in age , the reddening law , and the photospheric models themselves .",
    "the rms residuals from the above evaluation therefore provide a more realistic assessment of the true uncertainties in the quantities estimated from the sed fits .",
