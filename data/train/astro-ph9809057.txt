    "elliptical galaxies have long been considered to be inert stellar systems , essentially devoid of interstellar matter .",

    "present - day instrumental sensitivity across the electro - magnetic spectrum has revealed the presence of a complex , diverse ism in elliptical galaxies , challenging their very definition in hubble s galaxy classification scheme .",

    "it is therefore important to understand the nature of the optical nebulosity ( _ e.g. _ ,  is it physically associated with another component of the ism ? ; does it trace star formation activity or is it ionized by other means ? ) , in order to arrive at a correct description of the physics of the ism in giant ellipticals .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "i briefly review the multi - phase ism in elliptical galaxies in section 2 . in section 3 ,",

    "the most obvious source of interstellar matter in early - type galaxies is the material injected into interstellar space by stellar winds of evolving stars .",
    "a good estimate on the steady - state mass injection rate for an old stellar population typical for elliptical galaxies is provided by the product of the birth rate of planetary nebulae with the mass difference between the main sequence turn - off mass of such old stellar populations ( @xmath2 m@xmath3 ) and the mean mass of white dwarfs ; this estimate results in @xmath4 , and should be accurate to within a factor of three ( cf .",

    "[ f : bmsbplot ] shows that the measured line ratios are typically quite well matched by binette _",
    "_ s models for @xmath48 except for the /h@xmath0  ratio , which seems to be somewhat higher than predicted by their models .",
    "it should be noted that their model did not consider other old hot stars such as _ e.g. _ ,  agb - manqu stars which likely dominate the ( stellar ) production of ionizing photons in giant ellipticals ( see _ e.g. _ ,  brown _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) . also ,",
    "the effect of stellar metallicity on the lyman continuum output of post - agb stars still has to be included . clearly , more work on the properties of the ionizing radiation from uv - bright stars in ellipticals will help in appreciating the potential of this ionization mechanism .",
    "+ [ -5ex ]       + [ 0.25 mm ] another ample source of heat energy is available for ellipticals containing hot gas :  _ thermal conduction _ by hot electrons transfers energy from the hot gas to the cooler clouds , by a flux @xmath49 that saturates at at rate @xmath50 , the product of the pressure and the sound speed ( cowie & mckee 1977 ) . as the flux of photoelectric heat energy into a cloud",
    "is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mean energy per ionizing photon and @xmath53 k the temperature of the ionized gas , the ratio of the two energy fluxes is @xmath54 note that at the low ionization parameters observed in gassy ellipticals ( @xmath55 ) , thermal conduction can easily dominate photoelectric heating in a hot gas ( see also voit & donahue 1997 ) .",
    "however , a coupled photoionization / conduction code is needed to solve for the line emission caused by this excitation mechanism but is not yet available ; in addition , further work will be necessary to determine how electrons distribute their energy throughout the cool clouds as a function of their velocity ( see _ e.g. _ ,  voit 1991 ) .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the organizing committee of this conference for a job very well done .",
    "it was an honor to be invited to participate in such an outstanding meeting .",
    "this paper is partially based on observations collected at the european southern observatory , la silla , chile .",
    "the isaac newton telescope is operated at the island of la palma by the royal greenwich observatory in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofisica de canarias .",
    "g.  trinchieri i d like to comment that while _ axaf _ will of course be great for this kind of work , also _",
    "hri data has already shown that there is a remarkable correlation between the morphology of the x - ray emission and the h@xmath0 +  emission in a few objects .",
    "one is in fact ngc  5846 , the same galaxy for which you showed that the dust correlates beautifully with the h@xmath0 +  emission .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "pspc data for that galaxy even suggest ( the spatial resolution of pspc data does not allow a stronger statement here ) that the feature pointing to the ne in both x - ray and h@xmath0  emission is cooler than the surrounding gas at the same radius .",
    "all of this seems to fit nicely into the `` evaporation flow '' picture .",
    "p.  goudfrooij",
    "no , i did nt .",
    "i considered the model of binette et al .",
    "( 1994 ) who used the schnberger pagb tracks for solar metallicity .",
    "i agree it would be very useful to re - consider binette et al.s model when the effects of metallicity on pagb ( and agb - manqu ) evolution can be evaluated .",
    "r.  bower how do the gas properties depend on environment ?",
    "for instance , if the gas comes from the accretion of gas - rich satellites , would nt you expect this mechanism to shut off in environments with high velocity dispersion ?",
    "p.  goudfrooij within the sample i presented , there is indeed a hint that gassy ellipticals are preferentially found in groups or in the field .",
    "there are however exceptions , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  m84 , m87 and ngc  4696 which are in the central regions of clusters . in those cases ,",
    "i regard the more likely origin of the gas to be _ stripping _ from a spiral passing by too closely for its own comfort , instead of accretion of a gas - rich galaxy as a whole .",
    "this would be consistent with the fact that none of these gassy cluster ellipticals show any signs of shells .",
    "r.  pogge a comment about your use of the veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) diagnostic diagrams .",
    "i would be reluctant to read too much into the various model curves they plot as regards your line data for the ellipticals .",
    "these models assume single clouds in which all of the electrons responsible for collisionally exciting the forbidden lines are photoelectrons from hydrogen .",
    "it is pretty clear from the extended x - ray emission and h@xmath0  correlations that a a lot more is going on these systems , so all bets are off .",
    "i think your point about needing to consider composite conduction & photoionization models is a more promising path to follow .",
    "there are a number of other ways to heat gas in these systems , for example turbulent mixing layers like those considered by binette and collaborators .",
    "p.  goudfrooij sure rick , i agree with your comments . as to the simple models depicted in the veilleux & osterbrock diagrams",
    ":  i merely mentioned them to show that the outer emission regions typically do not have a lower ionization parameter than the nuclear emission , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  that the source of ionizing photons seems to have an extended distribution . as to models involving turbulent mixing layers ,",
    "these typically give rise to the `` type ii '' emission - line ratios seen in central cluster galaxies featuring `` cooling - flows '' ( cf .",
    "heckman _ et al . _",
    "1989 ) , whereas `` my '' sample of giant ellipticals typically show `` type i '' line ratios .",
