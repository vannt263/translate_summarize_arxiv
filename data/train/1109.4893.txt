    "soft materials such as colloidal suspensions and emulsions form a remarkably rich variety of non - ergodic states @xcite  examples of which are familiar to us in our daily life in products as diverse as foodstuffs , surface coatings , fabric conditioners , and pesticides .",
    "out - of - equilibrium phases occur when suspensions are quenched deep into a region of thermodynamic phase separation .",
    "unable to phase separate , amorphous solids form which are mechanically rigid but without the long - range translational order characteristic of crystalline solids .",
    "slow relaxation dynamics prevents the system from reaching their underlying global equilibrium configurations so these amorphous solids evolve slowly in a complex energy landscape with a high number of local minima and as a result display glassy dynamics with a rich phenomenology of effects such as aging , non - linear responses , and spatial and temporal dynamic heterogeneities .",
    "one of the most dramatic macroscopic manifestations of aging is the phenomenon of sudden network collapse in gels .",
    "gels consist of a network of particles linked together by long - lived attractive bonds . sedimentation or creaming of the particles within a gel",
    "imposes a buoyant stress on the network which since gels are intrinsically rather delicate has dramatic consequences for microscopic structure and dynamics @xcite .",
    "weak gels , where the strength of the attractive potential at contact @xmath6 is only a few @xmath7 , show , for instance , a very unusual mechanical response .",
    "initially , the gel behaves as a solid but after a finite lag time @xmath0 , the gel yields and catastrophically collapses . sudden or ` delayed ' network collapse is observed in a wide variety of materials @xcite and seems to be ubiquitous at small @xmath8 .",
    "however , while sudden collapse has been attributed to channel formation within the gel @xcite , the microscopic processes operating have never been fully established . a better microscopic understanding of the origin of sudden gel collapse is important not only because the distinctive settling behavior is intriguing from a scientific viewpoint but also because a quantitative prediction of gel stability is a critically important issue in the formulation and manufacture of many commercial products .",
    "the aim of this paper is to report a detailed experimental study of the stability of gels under gravitational stress .",
    "we use a colloidal suspension of nearly monodisperse emulsion drops of radius @xmath9 suspended in an index - matched mixture of solvents , which has been well characterized elsewhere @xcite .",
    "gelation is induced by long - range attractive depletion forces . using time - lapse video imaging we measure the dependence of the height @xmath2 of a gel upon its age @xmath1 , counted from the moment when the gel was formed .",
    "no macroscopic sedimentation is observed initially but after a period of latency the gel undergoes a rapid collapse as the system separates into colloid - rich and colloid - poor phases .",
    "we investigate the collapse dynamics as a function of the strength @xmath10 of the attractive interactions and the initial height @xmath4 of the gel .",
    "remarkably we find that when collapse starts the change in the height of the gel @xmath11 follows a simple universal dependence on @xmath1 which is independent of the initial height @xmath4 of the gel .",
    "the observation of height - independent collapse is surprising and contrasts with the marked height dependence seen in short - range gels studied to date @xcite . using a combination of rheology , confocal microscopy and time - lapse video imaging",
    "we speculate that the collapse of the gel network occurs as a result of irreversible aging , via a spatially heterogeneous process of localized ` micro - collapses ' , which leads to a build up of internal stress within the gel and its ultimate failure .",

    "a long - range attractive interaction was induced between emulsion colloids by polymer depletion .",
    "the emulsion consisted of poly(dimethyl siloxane ) drops dispersed in a solvent mixture of 1,2-ethane diol ( ed ) and water ( mass fraction of ed = 0.59 ) .",
    "the solvent composition was adjusted to closely match the refractive index of the emulsion to minimize van der waals attractions between drops and to enable confocal imaging to be conducted deep within the sample .",
    "a particle radius of @xmath12 nm and a size polydispersity of 0.17 @xmath13 0.07 was determined from dynamic light scattering measurements .",
    "the thickness of the polymeric stabilizing layer surrounding each emulsion drop was evaluated by centrifuging a suspension and equating the packing fraction of the sediment to the jamming density of a hard sphere system with the same polydispersity @xcite .",
    "this procedure gave a layer thickness of @xmath14 nm . the density mismatch between emulsion drops and the continuous phase is @xmath15 kg m@xmath16 . to induce a depletion interaction , we added the non - adsorbing anionic polymer xanthan ( kelco , @xmath17 = 4.66 x 10@xmath18 g mol@xmath19 ) .",
    "the polymer radius of gyration was determined as @xmath20 nm by light scattering and viscometry .",
    "the strength of the depletion attraction generated is a function of the polymer concentration and its range is controlled by the relative size @xmath21 of the polymer and particle .",
    "the polymer concentration is quoted here in terms of the dimensionless ratio @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the overlap concentration ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 is avogadro s constant .",
    "full details of sample preparation are contained in @xcite .    to monitor the collapse of the gels we used time - lapse video recording to record images of the emulsions as they cream .",
    "a low magnification image of the settling gel was projected onto a ccd camera ( allied vision technologies f-080b ) .",
    "a regular sequence of images was captured every 20 seconds .",
    "the image series was corrected for optical distortion and non - uniformities in illumination before being calibrated using an accurate grid of lines .",
    "the images near the center of the cells were analyzed and the interface separating the upper ( dark ) phase from the lower ( bright ) phase was identified automatically using an image analysis routine .",
    "the height @xmath2 of the interface was extracted as a function of time with an accuracy of about @xmath26 mm . to aid visualization a low concentration ( @xmath27 ) of an adsorbing black dye , sudan black , was added .",
    "the dye preferentially partitions into the index - matched pdms drops so that the colloid - rich phase appears dark in transmitted light .",
    "the colloid - polymer mixtures were thoroughly mixed at the start of the experiments before being loaded into cylindrical glass vials with an internal diameter of @xmath28 mm .",
    "the cell diameter was varied between 15  23 mm and both cylindrical glass and poly(styrene ) cells were used , with no significant change in collapse behavior . to eliminate air bubbles which lead to irreproducible settling dynamics we used a gentle slow tumbling of the sample vial to thoroughly mix the samples before observation .",
    "repeat experiments showed that following this protocol the collapse kinetics could be measured with a reproducibility of about 10 - 15% .",
    "rheological measurements were performed at 23@xmath29 with a bohlin hr nano rheometer ( malvern instruments ) . to study simultaneously the temporal evolution of the elastic properties and the height of the gel a novel rheometric vane experiment was developed which allowed visual observation of the gel as rheological measurements were performed .",
    "the vane was made from stainless steel and consisted of four blades ( diameter 22.7 mm , height 10 mm ) .",
    "the vane was carefully inserted into clear polycarbonate sample vials ( diameter 25 mm , height 65 mm ) , 10 mm below the top surface of the gel and a thin layer of silicone oil added to minimize evaporation .",
    "the vane remained inside the dense upper phase for the duration of the rheological experiments , allowing the collapse process to be continuously monitored .",
    "oscillation measurements were performed at 0.5 hz at intervals of 200 - 250  s under controlled stress conditions , within the experimentally - determined linear viscoelastic region , while the height of the gel was monitored simultaneously by time - lapse video microscopy .",
    "the absence of wall slip was confirmed by watching the movement of small air bubbles deliberately introduced into samples .    to directly probe changes in the microscopic topology of the gel during collapse we used fluorescent confocal microscopy .",
    "the continuous phase of the gel was labeled with @xmath30 of the fluorescent dye rhodamine - b which combined with the high transparency of the emulsions provided by refractive - index matching allowed high resolution optical visualization deep within the gel . a light microscope ( zeiss , axioskop s100 ) was mounted horizontally on its side , at right angles to gravity , and two - dimensional fluorescent images of regions 146 @xmath31 146 @xmath32 m were acquired at 543 nm .",
    "the gel was contained in a square cross - section glass vial , with an internal dimension of 13 mm , mounted on a low profile translation stage so that the gel could be imaged at different vertical positions , throughout the full 30 mm height of the sample @xcite .",
    "since the emulsion drop radius is below the optical resolution limit of the confocal microscope we can not identify individual drops .",
    "instead , we concentrated on the larger scale structure of the gel .",
    "the bicontinuous network was identified by thresholding the confocal images to determine the location of the interface separating the ( dark ) emulsion phase from the ( bright ) continuous phase . to correct for in - plane variation in the fluorescence yield ,",
    "each image was divided into 16 sub - images and a local threshold for each sub - image was determined using a cluster - based algorithm @xcite .",
    "a careful analysis of the resulting binary images , backed up by direct observation , showed that this approach reliably located the shape and positions of the emulsion and aqueous domains .",

    "first , as reported in previous work @xcite , @xmath0 grows strongly with increasing polymer concentration .",
    "indeed the concentration dependence of the lag time is well described by the exponential relationship , @xmath41 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : collapse - dynamics](c ) .",
    "second , the sedimentation profiles are remarkably similar in shape when plotted in a linear - log representation .",
    "the height profile at a low polymer concentration may be simply mapped onto a high concentration sample by shifting the collapse profile to the right along the logarithmic time - axis . to explore this scaling behavior quantitatively",
    ", we focus purely on the collapse regime and replot the change @xmath11 in the height of the gel as a function of the shifted time variable @xmath42 , the time counted from the instant when the network first yields .",
    "[ fig : collapse - dynamics](b ) demonstrates , rather unexpectedly , that the initial change in the height of the gel depends linearly upon @xmath43 , over a wide range of polymer concentrations . in the early stages of gel collapse , where @xmath44 , the height of the gel follows approximately the algebraic expression @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a polymer - dependent prefactor .",
    "the existence of this simple relationship suggests a single common mechanism is controlling the collapse of the gel at different polymer concentrations .",
    "we return to a more detailed discussion of this point in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] to speculate on a possible origin of the @xmath47 scaling found here .",
    "finally , we note that an alternative scaling has been suggested by kilfoil et al .",
    "we found however that their approach failed when applied to the wide range of polymer concentrations and heights studied here .    , and @xmath48 .",
    "the arrows indicate the lag time @xmath0 .",
    "( b ) the lag time @xmath0 as a function of the initial height @xmath4 of the gel , for a number of different polymer concentrations .",
    "the open symbols denote data obtained in glass - walled cells while the filled symbols indicate measurements in poly(styrene ) cells .",
    "the nature of the cell wall has no noticeable effect on the delay time measured .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    previous studies @xcite of gel collapse have suggested that the mechanism of collapse depends sensitively on the initial height @xmath4 of the gel .",
    "gels formed in short sample cells display steady or ` creeping ' sedimentation where the height falls continuously with age at a rate which decays exponentially with time while taller samples show sudden collapse . to test whether this behavior is intrinsic to the long - range systems studied here",
    "we have varied the initial height @xmath4 and monitored the evolution of the height of the gel with time .",
    "in all the samples reported here , polymer concentration from @xmath49 and heights @xmath50 mm , sudden gel collapse was always observed and we saw no transition to creeping sedimentation .",
    "[ fig : height - independent - delay - times](a ) shows a representative set of data where the time evolution of the interface height @xmath39 is plotted for a range of initial heights and a single polymer concentration ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "inspection of the data reveals that rather surprisingly the time @xmath0 during which the gel is solid - like is largely independent of the initial height @xmath4 of the sample .",
    "measurement of the variation of @xmath0 with height for a wide range of polymer concentrations , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : height - independent - delay - times](b ) , confirms this observation .",
    "we have checked that this is not due to solid friction between the gel and cell wall @xcite by repeating measurements at @xmath51 using cylindrical poly(styrene ) cells to alter the degree of wall adhesion .",
    "the results , shown as the filled data points in fig .",
    "[ fig : height - independent - delay - times](b ) , are in excellent agreement with the data obtained in the glass vials ( open points ) , demonstrating that wall friction is unimportant .",
    "since the gel is initially a solid , the top of the sample vial is subject to a gravitational stress @xmath52 , which is generated by the full buoyant stress of all of the suspension below , so @xmath53 .",
    "taking @xmath54 and @xmath55 kg m@xmath16 we estimate that @xmath52 varies from between approximately 5 to 15 pa for the heights used here .",
    "the values for the buoyant stress considerably exceeds the yield stress of the gel network , which we estimate from rheological measurements as @xmath56 pa , so even while @xmath52 is an order of magnitude larger than the stress required to break the gel s load - bearing structure the gel does not collapse macroscopically .",
    "the insensitivity of @xmath0 to @xmath4 means we can rule out the possibility that the initial period of latency of the gel is determined purely by the breaking of single uncorrelated bonds .",
    "collapse clearly requires a substantially larger degree of restructuring of the network than is necessary simply for mechanical yielding .    to explore the effect of height on the kinetics of collapse we focus on the initial rate of collapse of the gel with different @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fig : t3/2-plots ] shows that the power - law expression ( eq .",
    "[ eqn - experimental - t3/2 ] ) which captures well the height variation in gels with a fixed @xmath4 also holds for gels with a wide variety of different starting heights .",
    "the gel does not collapse with a fixed time - invariant velocity but rather the interface velocity @xmath57 behaves at short times like @xmath58 , a behavior which hints at a surprisingly novel mechanism of collapse . to further investigate this mechanism",
    "we have studied the dependence of the prefactor @xmath59 on the height and polymer content of the gel .",
    "[ fig : t3/2-plots](c ) shows that rather remarkably , for all the gels studied , the prefactor @xmath46 does not change with the initial height of the gel . since the gravitational stress @xmath52 on the gel increases linearly with its height",
    ", this result suggests that @xmath52 is relatively unimportant in determining the process of collapse , at least under the conditions of our experiments .",
    "the central role of thermally - induced bond dissociation is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : t3/2-plots](d ) where it is revealed that the prefactor @xmath46 scales exponentially with @xmath60 , equivalent to an exponential dependence on the depth of the interaction potential . in conclusion ,",
    "the process of collapse appears to be thermally rather than stress - activated .    to interpret these striking observations",
    "we model the initial deformation of a gel using the poroelastic formalism first introduced by buscall and white @xcite . in this approach",
    "the gel is treated as a biphasic fluid - saturated porous continuum with the pore pressure @xmath61 as a state variable .",
    "a gel consists of two distinct phases : a solid phase of connected strands of emulsion particles , and a second liquid phase consisting of a fluid solution of a non - adsorbing polymer . in the early stages of collapse",
    "the gel is essentially uncompressed so there is no elastic stress due to deformation and the rate of collapse is limited essentially by the rate at which fluid is forced out of the gel @xcite . defining @xmath62 as the macroscopic velocity of the fluid flow through the gel and @xmath63 as the local displacement of the solid network along the gravitational @xmath64-axis then using darcy s law , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the permeability of the network , which since we are considering only the early stage of collapse we assume to be height independent , and @xmath67 is the viscosity of the continuous phase .",
    "continuity demands @xmath68 which , since @xmath69 , implies that the fluid velocity @xmath70 must be small @xcite in comparison to @xmath71 . consequently ,",
    "if the displacement of the gel varies as @xmath43 then , from eq .",
    "[ eqn - darcy ] , the pressure gradient at the top of the gel , adjacent to the interface , must be increasing as @xmath72 .",
    "this time dependence rules out a simple compression of the gel as a consequence of gravity because the pressure gradient would then be a constant , @xmath73 , and the gel would accordingly shrink linearly with time @xcite .",
    "the @xmath72 dependence of @xmath61 suggests instead a diffusive process may be responsible for the unusual collapse dynamics seen .",
    "we can however rule out a bulk diffusive process of conventional syneresis , akin to the shrinkage of a polymer gel undergoing a phase transition @xcite . in this case , the contraction of the matrix as the phase separation ensues would generate an increase in @xmath61 which leads to the expulsion of fluid and a shrinkage of the gel as @xmath74 @xcite rather than the @xmath75 dependence seen here . furthermore , this process would require fluid to be transported through the full length of the system so the rate of diffusion would depend on the height of the gel , which is also incompatible with our data .",
    "clearly , a new mechanism is required to correctly explain the observed data .",
    "sudden collapse reflects a dramatic loss of mechanical integrity as the gel ages . to understand the nature of this mechanical failure",
    ", we first examine the evolution of the elastic properties of the gel while simultaneously recording the height of the gel .",
    "figure  [ fig : vane - rheology ] shows the rheology and interface height @xmath39 during the settling of a representative gel . at the earliest times recorded ,",
    "the sample is solid - like with an elastic shear modulus @xmath76 which is larger than the viscous modulus @xmath77 .",
    "the measurements however reveal that the elasticity of the gel far from reducing with time , as one might naively expect , actually increases continuously up to the point @xmath78 when the gel starts to collapse .",
    "immediately collapse starts , @xmath76 also drops , but only by a relatively small amount ( less than 10% ) , before finally growing steadily as the emulsion volume fraction in the upper phase increases with the onset of phase separation .",
    "we see no sign of large - scale hydrodynamic mixing , recirculation , and the development of channels which have been seen in some other studies of gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing that even though @xmath76 drops at the initiation of collapse the overall mechanical response remains predominantly elastic ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "we suspect that this reflects the inhomogeneous nature of the network at collapse .",
    "if the sample is heterogeneous the response measured will be an average over regions where the gel has broken apart , and is a fluid , with other portions of the network which remain elastic .",
    "the recorded response will then depend on the relative sizes of the mechanical vane and the inhomogeneous regions within the gel . to confirm that the sample becomes a fluid when the gel begins to collapse we have placed a small glass block about half the width of the cell in the base of the cell .",
    "when the gel begins to collapse the interface between the gel and the bottom of the cell rapidly flattens indicating that the base of the gel becomes a fluid of aggregates as the gel collapses .",
    "while the rheological measurements provide a mechanical insight into gel settling , they do not clarify the link between the macroscopic processes of collapse and the microscopic structural reorganization occurring during aging and sedimentation .",
    "indeed , at first sight , it seems counter - intuitive that a gel which is becoming gradually stiffer with time should ever collapse at all . to probe the link between the microscopic and macroscopic length scales ,",
    "we have examined the temporal evolution of the gel microstructure using confocal microscopy .",
    "the coarsening is illustrated by the binary two - dimensional images reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : aging ] . in the rectangular cell used for imaging experiments , the delay time was measured as @xmath80 s",
    "so both images refer to the latency period before collapse starts .",
    "clearly , although the gel remains mechanically stable during this period there is a slow but continuous evolution in the microscopic nature of the particle network and the system is not arrested",
    ". a closer look at the data in fig  [ fig : aging ] reveals that the interface between the continuous and particle phases is quite rough , suggesting that surface tension is unimportant and the dense portion of the gel is not a fluid .",
    "direct observation show that particle diffusion is strongly suppressed and particles move infrequently between the strands of the network , indicating that the interaction network is probably glassy .",
    "the images in fig  [ fig : aging ] illustrate two further microstructural characteristics which will be important to our later discussion on the mechanism of network collapse .",
    "first , it is evident that the thickness of the backbone of the gel grows slowly but continuously with time , a fact which probably explains the increase of @xmath76 with @xmath1 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vane - rheology ] .",
    "second , the thickness of the network of particle strands is not uniform .",
    "the gel contains a relatively large number of thin junction points where two or three arms ( in 2d ) are connected together .",
    "simultaneous breakage of the particle bonds at these relatively weak junction points would lead to a rapid break up of the whole network .",
    ", @xmath33 after ( a ) @xmath81 s , and ( b ) @xmath82  s from preparation .",
    "gravity points vertically downwards and the scale bar corresponds to 20  @xmath32m.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to quantify the change of the microstructure with time , we use chord methods developed to analyze statistically random heterogeneous materials @xcite .",
    "we superimpose on the images of fig  [ fig : aging ] a uniform grid of horizontal and vertical lines .",
    "the two - phase interfaces divide each grid line into chords that are either inside the dense part of the network or else lie within the solvent background .",
    "we define a chord as the line segment between two consecutive intersections of the random line with the bounding two - phase interface . focusing only on those chords that lie _ within _ the dense strands of the network , we count the number of chords @xmath83 with lengths in the range @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "if @xmath86 is the total number of chords then the degree of linear ` connectedness ' of the gel may be characterized in terms of a probability density function , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 the quantity @xmath89 is the probability that a randomly - chosen chord has a length between @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "we find that the chord length distribution @xmath87 displays a characteristic shape , with @xmath87 first increasing with growing @xmath84 before reaching a maximum at a finite @xmath84 and finally decaying exponentially for larger @xmath84 .",
    "the diameter of the strands of particles within the gel may be characterized either from the value at which @xmath87 takes a maximum value or from the mean chord length @xmath90 @xmath91 which we use here because it displays a smaller statistical error .",
    "finally , the chord functions also provide an efficient means to estimate the volume fraction of the high density colloidal regions in the gel .",
    "if we assume the gel is isotropic and the two - dimensional images are chosen randomly then the fraction @xmath92 of the volume of the gel occupied by the dense regions is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the total length of the original lines .",
    "the volume fraction of colloids , @xmath95 , in the dense regions of the gel is given by the ratio @xmath96 , where @xmath35 is the initial colloid volume fraction .",
    "next we characterize the slow evolution of the gel structure .",
    "[ fig : evolution - of - colloidal - network ] shows the age dependence of the mean chord length @xmath90 and the volume fraction @xmath95 prior to collapse .",
    "a key observation is that during the latency period when the height of the gel is unchanged structural reorganization is never fully arrested but continues , albeit rather slowly .",
    "so , for instance , the growth of the mean chord length is well described by a power law , @xmath97 , with an exponent @xmath98 .",
    "the growth law is always much slower than the @xmath99 dependence expected for the diffusive regime of classical liquid - gas phase separation .",
    "the growth exponent @xmath98 depend rather strongly on the polymer concentration with @xmath98 decreasing markedly as @xmath22 is increased .",
    "similar slow growth has been identified previously in simulations of deep quenched lennard - jones systems @xcite and has been interpreted as indicating that the dense domains of the gel are actually glassy .     in the colloid phase , in units of the particle diameter .",
    "the rate of increase of @xmath90 is always slower than the diffusive growth , @xmath100 ( shown by dashed line ) characteristic of classical spinodal decomposition @xcite , and slows down considerably with increasing polymer concentration @xmath22 .",
    "( b ) average colloid volume fraction @xmath95 within dense regions of the gel , as a function of elapsed time .",
    "the density of the particle strands within the network increases progressively with age before rising rapidly at the onset of gel collapse .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]      having characterized the macroscopic process of collapse , we now discuss the mechanism for the initial failure of the particle network .",
    "a gel is a metastable phase with a high free energy density whose consolidation is driven ultimately by the thermodynamic driving force for phase separation .",
    "however once a stable percolating network of strands of particles is formed the dynamics of phase separation is slowed down considerably because , as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : aging ] , the strands of the network are many particles wide so large scale rearrangements of the gel require the simultaneous dissociation of all of the particle bonds within the cross - section of a strand , which will be very rare .",
    "the network accordingly lowers its free energy via a series of small - scale structural reorganizations which proceed through the rupture of essentially single particle bonds .",
    "the breakup of an energetic bond between particles , diffusion to dense region of the network , and a reformation of the broken bond allows a net increase in the number of nearest neigbouring particles with a concomitant lowering of the free energy of the system . for the network to coarsen",
    ", the system must overcome the energetic barrier associated with single bond rupture .",
    "this could be achieved , in principle , either thermally or as a result of an applied stress .",
    "the observation that the delay time is unaffected by the initial height of the gel strongly suggests that the delay time and hence the rupture of individual bonds is controlled primarily by thermal fluctuations rather than being stress - driven .    to calculate the average lifetime @xmath101 of an individual particle bond due to thermal fluctuations",

    "this strong correlation highlights the pivotal role of spontaneous thermal fluctuations in determining the latency period of the gel .",
    "the fact that the delay time is many times longer than the rupture of a single bond probably reflects the cooperative nature of gel failure .",

    "@xmath118 is essentially independent of age , presumably because rupture is an activated process which is dominated by the single particle bond energy barrier .",
    "the consequence of the different time dependence seen for association and rupture is that the proportion of breakage events @xmath119 ( shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : aging - events](b ) ) grows with the age of the gel .",
    "the increasing proportion of strand ruptures ultimately leads to failure of the stress - bearing backbone of the gel and the initiation of collapse .",

    "any deformation due to a local rearrangement can propagate macroscopic distances so the size of regions which undergo correlated rearrangements can be sizeable .",
    "if this holds true in our system , then it should be feasible to see signs of the long - range distortion field generated by local rearrangement events by microscopy .    to test these ideas",

    "a natural question is the physical origin of this unusual behavior .",
    "we propose that the dominant mechanism for collapse is the appearance of random micro - collapsed regions throughout the gel . on a microscopic level",
    ", the basic idea is that the particles comprising the gel attract each other relatively strongly so over time the gel spontaneously restructures locally to create small regions of more dense packing .",
    "since the collapsing particles are attached quite strongly to strands of the network as they rearrange they induce a local pressure field .",
    "this induced field , as a consequence of the poroelastic character of the gel , expands relatively slowly into the bulk of the gel .",
    "it is this long - range pressure field which we hypothesize generates the characteristic collapse dynamics evident in our experiments .",
    "similar arguments have been invoked to account for the anomalous microscopic motion evident in dynamical light scattering of colloidal gels @xcite but not , as far as we are aware , for the macroscopic settling dynamics of gels .",
    "while our discussion has some features in common with the purely elastic models used previously @xcite , we focus here on deformations at large ( macroscopic ) length scales where poroelastic fluid flows are important .    for the moment",
    ", we idealize the gel as a one - dimensional chain of particles . then if two particles leaves their equilibrium positions to stick together the left - hand particle imposes a force @xmath142 on the left part of the chain at @xmath143 , while the right - hand particle imposes an equal and opposite force @xmath144 on the right - hand side of the chain located at @xmath145 .",
    "the net effect of the rearrangement is therefore the creation of a local dipolar force @xmath146 at the random position @xmath147 .",
    "the intensity of this dipolar force , the dipole moment @xmath32 , is the product of the force @xmath148 and the displacement vector @xmath149 in the limit as @xmath150 . at the dipolar stress center the fluid pressure @xmath61 rises rapidly to a high value while further away @xmath61 is almost unchanged .",
    "the resulting pressure gradient drives a flow through the porous medium and as fluid exits from around the applied force the gel deforms locally and more of the load is borne by the network .",
    "eventually , the pressure at all points reaches the same value and the gel relaxes so that the applied load is everywhere balanced by the elastic stresses in the network . the time scale for this equilibration is determined by a diffusion constant @xmath151 , with the deformation in the gel occurring over a length scale @xmath152 in a time @xmath153 .",
    "the gel diffusion constant @xmath151 is @xcite @xmath154 where @xmath66 is the permeability of the network , @xmath107 is the viscosity of the continuous phase , and @xmath155 is the bulk modulus of the network . using measurements of the low shear viscosity ( @xmath156 pas ) , the elastic modulus of the gels ( @xmath157 pa ) , and literature values for the permeability of similar density gels @xcite ( @xmath158 m@xmath159 ) we estimate a diffusion constant in our system of @xmath160 m@xmath159s@xmath19 . both the pore pressure and , in general , the permeability will change with time as the gel contracts locally . however in the initial stages of collapse the gel is uncompressed",

    "we shall ignore all non - linear effects .",
    "the bulk shrinkage of an unconstrained gel is linear so it is natural to assume that the dipole intensity will also be a linear function of time , @xmath161 .    for simplicity ,",
    "we first consider the isotropic deformation produced in the gel by the supposition of three continuous orthogonal stress dipole centers ( a single center of compression @xcite ) .",
    "rudnicki @xcite has shown that the pore pressure at a distance @xmath162 from a single continuous center of compression in a fluid - saturated porous solid is of the form @xmath163 where @xmath164 , @xmath165 is proportional to @xmath166 , and erfc is the complementary error function @xcite .",

    "[ fig : pressure ] we plot a time series of the spreading pressure field as it diffuses away from the origin .",
    "the length scale where the pressure is finite is controlled by fluid diffusion within the gel and is thus time - dependent . from the figure it is clear that the spatial extent of the pressure field is of order @xmath169 . finally , as @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and the pressure field approaches the pure @xmath172-elastostatic solution , expected for a continuous dipole source @xcite .",
    "we assume that at the start of collapse the gel contains centers of compression which are randomly distributed throughout the height of the gel , with a certain number @xmath173 per unit length . to calculate the velocity of the gel interface @xmath174 we note that , from darcy s law ( eq .",
    "[ eqn - darcy ] ) , @xmath174 is fixed by the total pressure gradient at the bottom of the gel . if we assume that each micro - collapse contributes independently then the pressure gradient is simply the sum of the gradients generated by individual events occurring at different heights @xmath175 within the gel . for simplicity",
    "we ignore the true vectorial nature of the problem and use a scalar approximation in which we assume that the pressure field due to each independent micro - collapse adds together coherently to produce the macroscopic pressure field . since the vertical pressure gradient must control the process of collapse we focus solely on the @xmath64-direction . a single center of compression located a distance @xmath175 from the gel interface creates a pressure gradient , @xmath176 , which from eq .",
    "[ eqn - p ] is @xmath177 the growth data in fig .",
    "[ fig : hetereogeneous ] suggests that coarsening of the network is suppressed near a surface , _ i.e. _ micro - collapse events appear preferentially at distances @xmath178 away from a surface .",
    "this seems plausible since the energy barrier for a rearrangement near an interface will probably be higher than for the same event in the bulk of the gel , as the strain induced by the creation of the dipole is larger .",
    "inspection of the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : hetereogeneous ] suggests that @xmath138 is of order a few millimeters .",

    "first , we find that the initial degree of settling is well described by the expression , @xmath198 , with @xmath141 the time counted from the moment when collapse first starts .",
    "second , both the process of collapse and the lag time @xmath0 are independent of the initial height of the gel .",
    "microscopically , the gel consists of a network of interconnected strands of particles .",
    "confocal microscopy reveals that continuous restructuring of this network occurs which , with increasing age , leads to the breaking of bonds between particle strands and a progressive weakening of the network .",
    "the subsequent reduction in the large scale connectivity of the network eventually triggers a macroscopic collapse .",
    "measurement of the microscopic structure of the gel during settling show that the age - dependent changes in the network are not isotropic but are concentrated around large inhomogeneities within the sample .",
    "we hypothesize that the collapse of the gel is determined by the rate at which fluid can be expelled from the gel .",
