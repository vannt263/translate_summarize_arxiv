    "<S> we propose a new mechanism to suppress the axion isocurvature perturbation , while producing the right amount of axion dark matter , within the framework of supersymmetric axion models with the axion scale induced by supersymmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism involves an intermediate phase transition to generate the higgs @xmath0-parameter , before which the weak scale is comparable to the axion scale and the resulting stronger qcd yields an axion mass heavier than the hubble scale over a certain period . </S>",
    "<S> combined with that the hubble - induced axion scale during the primordial inflation is well above the intermediate axion scale at present , the stronger qcd in the early universe suppresses the axion fluctuation to be small enough even when the inflationary hubble scale saturates the current upper bound , while generating an axion misalignment angle of order unity .    </S>",
    "<S> the non - observation of the neutron edm requires the cp violating qcd angle to be as tiny as @xmath1 , causing the strong cp problem . </S>",
    "<S> an appealing solution of this puzzle is to introduce a spontaneously broken global peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath2 corresponds to the vacuum value of the associated nambu - goldstone boson , the axion , which is determined to be vanishing by the low energy qcd dynamics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting consequence of this solution is that axions can explain the dark matter in our universe . </S>",
    "<S> yet , the prospect for axion dark matter depends on the cosmological history of the pq phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> a possible scenario is that the spontaneous pq breaking occurs after the primordial inflation is over . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , the model is constrained to have the domain - wall number @xmath3 , where @xmath4 corresponds to the integer - valued u@xmath5su@xmath6su@xmath7 anomaly coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> then axions are produced mainly by the annihilations of axionic strings and domain - walls , which would result in the right amount of axion dark matter for the axion scale @xmath8  gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however it appears to be difficult to realize this scenario within the framework of a fundamental theory such as string theory , since it requires a pq symmetry with @xmath9 , as well as a restored pq phase until some moment after the primordial inflation .    </S>",
    "<S> another scenario which we will focus on in this paper is that u@xmath10 is spontaneously broken during the primordial inflation and never restored afterwards . </S>",
    "<S> then the model is not subject to the condition @xmath9 , but is constrained by the axion isocurvature perturbation @xcite . for instance , from the observed cmb power spectrum , one finds @xcite , [ iso - constraint ] ( ) _ iso ( ) < 3.810 ^ -6 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the average misalignment angle and the angle fluctuation , respectively , for the axion field right before the conventional qcd phase transition when @xmath13 with a temperature @xmath14  gev . </S>",
    "<S> the relic axion density is given by [ axion - density ] 1.7 ^2_mis ( ) ^1.19 , with @xmath15 being the total dark matter fraction . </S>",
    "<S> here we have assumed that @xmath16 and there is no significant evolution of @xmath17 from @xmath18 to the present time @xmath19 so that @xmath20 . in inflationary cosmology , the primordial quantum fluctuation of the axion field results in [ angle - fluctuation ] ( t_qcd ) = ( t_i)= , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the axion scale and the hubble parameter , respectively , during the primordial inflation epoch @xmath23 , and the factor @xmath24 is introduced to take into account the evolution of @xmath12 from @xmath23 to @xmath18 . note that the inflationary hubble scale @xmath22 is bounded by the tensor - to - scalar ratio of the cmb perturbation as [ hubble - bound ] r 0.16()^2 < 0.11,and the weak gravity conjecture @xcite suggests that generic axion scales are bounded as [ weak - gravity ] f_a o(m_pl),where @xmath25  gev is the reduced planck mass .    to discuss the implication of the isocurvature constraint ( [ iso - constraint ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , one needs to specify the cosmological evolution of the axion scale after the primordial inflation is over . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath26 as has been assumed in most of the previous studies , it requires that either @xmath22 is smaller than its upper bound @xmath27  gev by at least five orders of magnitude , so that the cmb tensor mode is too small to be observable , or @xmath12 should experience a large suppression after the primordial inflation , which appears to be difficult to be implemented .    </S>",
    "<S> the above observation suggests a more attractive scenario realizing @xmath28 @xcite in a natural manner . indeed supersymmetric axion models offer a natural scheme to realize such a scenario , generating the axion scale through the competition between the tachyonic susy breaking mass term and a supersymmetric , but planck - scale - suppressed higher dimensional term in the scalar potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one then finds [ axion - scale ] f_a(t_0 ) & ~ & , + f_a(t_i ) & ~ & , which explains elegantly the origin of an intermediate axion scale at present , while giving a hubble - induced inflationary axion scale well above the present axion scale , if the supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking mass @xmath29 at present is around tev scale . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this type of axion models can be successfully embedded into string theory . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , they can be identified as a low energy limit of string models involving an anomalous u@xmath30 gauge symmetry with vanishing fayet - illiopoulos term @xcite . in such string models , </S>",
    "<S> the u@xmath30 gauge boson is decoupled from the low energy world by receiving a heavy mass @xmath31 through the stckelberg mechanism , while leaving the global part of u@xmath30 as an unbroken pq symmetry in the supersymmetric limit . </S>",
    "<S> once susy breaking is introduced properly , in both the present universe and the inflationary early universe , the residual pq symmetry can be spontaneously broken to generate the axion scales as ( [ axion - scale ] ) .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss a novel mechanism to suppress the axion isocurvature perturbation , while producing the right amount of axion dark mater , within the framework of supersymmetric axion models with the axion scales given by ( [ axion - scale ] ) . the isocurvature constraint ( [ iso - constraint ] ) and </S>",
    "<S> the relic axion density ( [ axion - density ] ) suggest that for @xmath22 near the current upper bound @xmath27  gev , the allowed amount of axion dark matter is maximal when @xmath32@xmath33  gev , while @xmath21 nearly saturates the weak gravity bound ( [ weak - gravity ] ) , e.g.  @xmath34@xmath35  gev . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the axions scales generated by susy breaking as ( [ axion - scale ] ) automatically realize such pattern if @xmath29 is around tev scale . more specifically , for the case f_a(t_0)/f_a(t_i ) , the isocurvature bound ( [ iso - constraint ] ) reads off < ( ) ^2 ( ) ( ) ^0.8 ( ) , when combined with ( [ axion - density ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that a high scale inflation scenario with @xmath36@xmath37  gev , which would give an observable tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath38@xmath39 in the cmb perturbation , can be compatible with the axion dark matter @xmath40 , if the axion field fluctuation experiences just a mild suppression after @xmath23 , e.g.  @xmath41@xmath39 in ( [ angle - fluctuation ] ) .    to suppress @xmath12 through its cosmological evolution , one needs a period with @xmath42 well before @xmath18 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> usually this is not easy to be realized because the axion mass should be generated mostly by the qcd anomaly in order for the strong cp problem solved by the pq mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> ( see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for an alternative possibility . ) in the following , we propose a simple scheme to achieve such a cosmological period by having a phase of stronger qcd in the early universe </S>",
    "<S> .    our scheme is based on a phase transition at @xmath43 , which will be called the @xmath0-transition in the following as it generates the higgs @xmath0-parameter through the superpotential term @xcite , [ kim - nilles ] ( x)h_uh_d , where @xmath44 is a pq - charged gauge - singlet superfield . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , x(tt_)=0 , x(t > t_)~ , so that ( tt_)=0 , ( t > t _ ) ~m_susy . with this transition , </S>",
    "<S> the weak scale experiences an unusual evolution in a way that the weak scale before the @xmath0-transition is comparable to the axion scale ( [ axion - scale ] ) , as will be discussed below .    to proceed , </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss first the key features of the scheme , and later present an explicit model to realize the whole ingredients . including the hubble - induced contribution , the mass of the @xmath45-flat higgs direction @xmath46 is generically given by m_^2 = c_h^2 + _ m_susy^2 + 2||^2 ( ^2h_uh_d ) , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are model - dependent parameters of order unity . in our scheme </S>",
    "<S> , both @xmath47 and @xmath48 are assumed to be negative , so @xmath49 before the @xmath0-transition . then @xmath50 is stabilized by the competition between the tachyonic @xmath51 and a supersymmetric term of @xmath52 in the scalar potential , which results in f_a(t_i)&~ & ( t_i)~ , + f_a(t_)&~ & ( t _ ) ~ . on the other hand , after the @xmath0-transition , @xmath53 due to @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting weak scale and axion scale at present are given by ( t_0 ) & = & o(100 ) gev , + f_a(t_0 ) & ~ & x(t_0 ) ~ .    </S>",
    "<S> a simple consequence of the above evolution of @xmath46 is that the weak scale is comparable to the axion scale before the @xmath0-transition : ( tt_)~ f_a f_a(tt _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a higher qcd scale , i.e. a stronger qcd , and therefore a heavier axion mass which might be even bigger than the hubble scale for a certain period . </S>",
    "<S> let us estimate the qcd scale @xmath55 before the @xmath0-transition , which is defined as the scale where the 1-loop qcd coupling blows up , as well as the resulting axion mass @xmath56 . for the case with @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes the gluino mass before the @xmath0-transition </S>",
    "<S> , we find _ qcd & & 23tev ( ) ^2/11 + & & ( ) ^3/11 ( ) ^6/11 , where @xmath59 at present , and @xmath60 for the gluino mass @xmath61 at present . here we assume that @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the qcd coupling and the quark yukawa couplings . when the temperature @xmath64 , the axion mass during the period of stronger qcd is estimated to be [ axion - mass-1 ] m_a ^2_qcd / f_a . on the other hand , if @xmath65 , the resulting qcd scale is estimated as _ </S>",
    "<S> qcd & & 21 tev ( ) ^1/3 ( ) ^2/3 , with the axion mass [ axion - mass-2 ] m_a m^1/2_g ^3/2_qcd / f_a . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath66 denotes the scale where the stronger qcd becomes nonperturbative , i.e.  around @xmath67 with @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the axion potential for the axion mass ( [ axion - mass-2 ] ) can be obtained by a single insertion of the susy breaking spurion @xmath69 to the nonperturbative superpotential @xmath70 induced by the gluino condensation .    </S>",
    "<S> if the stronger qcd scale @xmath71 is high enough , there could be a period with @xmath72 well before the conventional qcd phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> as is well known , in such a period the axion field experiences a damped oscillation , with an amplitude @xmath73 ( averaged over each oscillation period ) evolving as |a r^-3/2(t ) , where @xmath74 is the scale factor of the expanding universe . </S>",
    "<S> then the spatially averaged vacuum value of the axion field is settled down at the minimum of the axion potential induced by the stronger qcd , while the axion angle fluctuation is diluted according to [ angle - fluc ] = ( ) ^3/2 , where @xmath75 denotes the moment when the damped axion oscillation begins , and @xmath76 is the moment when it is over . note that , after the @xmath0-transition , the weak scale and the qcd scale quickly roll down to the present values , so the axion mass becomes negligible compared to @xmath77 until @xmath78 when the universe undergoes the conventional qcd phase transition . also , the minimum of the axion potential induced by the stronger qcd is generically different from the minimum of the axion potential at present . as a result , our scheme generates an axion misalignment angle of order unity : _ mis - = o(1 ) , together with an intermediate axion scale at present , so gives rise to @xmath40 in a natural way .    in our case </S>",
    "<S> , the damped axion oscillation induced by the stronger qcd begins at a temperature @xmath79 as @xmath56 is highly suppressed by thermal effects for @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the scalar field @xmath44 generating @xmath0 through ( [ kim - nilles ] ) is trapped at the origin by thermal effects until the universe cools down to a temperature @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , our scheme involves a variety of dimensionless parameters which affect the naive estimate of the involved scales . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is a large fraction of the natural parameter region where the axion mass m_a 0.4 mev ( ) ^-1 ( ) ^2 is larger than the hubble scale [ hubble ] h(t _ ) 0.2 mev ( ) , over the period @xmath82 with a temperature ratio : t(t_)/t(t_i)= o(10 ^ -110 ^ -2 ) </S>",
    "<S> . then the resulting @xmath12 given by ( [ angle - fluc ] ) can be small enough to satisfy the isocurvature bound ( [ iso - constraint ] ) even when @xmath22 saturates its upper bound @xmath27  gev . </S>",
    "<S> note that during @xmath82 , ( t)-(t_0)~ x(t)-x(t_0 ) ~ , so the corresponding vacuum energy density @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that in this period the universe is dominated by the vacuum energy density with the hubble scale given by ( [ hubble ] ) , which is often called the thermal inflation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed that in our scheme the axion isocurvature perturbation is suppressed by two steps . </S>",
    "<S> the first suppression is due to @xmath84 , and the second is due to the stronger qcd dynamics before the @xmath0-transition , yielding a further suppression by @xmath85 . to illustrate the result </S>",
    "<S> , we depict in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : iso - bound ] the upper bound on the inflationary hubble scale @xmath22 resulting from the isocurvature constraint ( [ iso - constraint ] ) for @xmath40 . to make a comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we depict the results for three distinct cases : @xmath86 the conventional scenario of @xmath87 without a stronger qcd , @xmath88 a scheme with @xmath89 , but without a stronger qcd , @xmath90 our scheme with @xmath89 and a stronger qcd before the @xmath0-transition .    </S>",
    "<S> l    let us now present an explicit model implementing the mechanisms discussed above . as a simple example , we consider a model with the following superpotential , [ model-1 ] & & w = ( ) + y^c + & & + + + , where @xmath44 and @xmath91 are pq - charged gauge singlets responsible for the @xmath0-transition , @xmath92 is the mssm lepton doublet , and @xmath93 are @xmath94-charged exotic matter fields introduced to give a thermal mass to @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> then the scalar potential for the @xmath0-transition is given by [ mu - transition ] v_1 & = & m_x^2|x|^2+m_y^2|y|^2 + ( xy^3+h.c . ) + & & + ( |y|^6 + 9|x|^2|y|^4 ) , where m_x^2 & = & c_xh^2+_xm_susy^2 + 4|_x|^2 , + m_y^2 & = & c_yh^2+_ym_susy^2 + _ yt^2 , for @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath96 are the hubble - induced masses , @xmath97 are the susy breaking masses at zero temperature , and @xmath98 is the thermal mass of @xmath91 induced by the coupling @xmath99 , which is of @xmath100 for @xmath101 .    for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we will assume that all the dimensionless parameters appearing in the superpotential and the susy breaking scalar masses are of order unity . </S>",
    "<S> however it should be noted that these parameters can have a variation of @xmath102@xmath103 easily . in particular , the superpotential parameters @xmath104 can have a much wider variation without invoking fine - tuning . </S>",
    "<S> this gives us a rather large room to get an enough suppression of the axion angle fluctuation @xmath12 through a stronger qcd before the @xmath0-transition . at any rate , assuming that @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , the scalar potential ( [ mu - transition ] ) indeed yields the desired @xmath0-transition as [ vev1 ] & & x = y=0 tt _ , + & & x~y ~ t > t _ , with @xmath81 .    </S>",
    "<S> now the higgs and slepton fields can have a nontrivial evolution along the following flat direction : & & h^t_d = ( _ d,0),l^t = ( _ , 0 ) , + & & h^t_u = ( 0 , ) , which satisfies the @xmath108 and @xmath45 flat conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant terms of the scalar potential of @xmath109 are given by v_2&= & m_i^2|_i|^2 + ( b_d + h.c . ) + & + & ( |_i|^2 ) ( + h.c . ) + & + & ( |_i|^2 ) ( |_d|^4 + 4|_d_|^2+|_|^4 ) , for @xmath110 , where m__d^2 & = & c_d h^2 + _ d m_susy^2 + 2||^2 , + m__^2&= & c_h^2 + _ m_susy^2 + ||^2 . again , assuming @xmath111 and @xmath112 , but @xmath113 due to @xmath114 , the above scalar potential yields [ vev2 ] f_a(t_i)~_d,(t_i)~ , + f_a(t_)~_d,(t_)~ , and [ vev3 ] _ </S>",

    "<S> ( t_0 ) = 0 , + f_a(t_0 ) & ~ & x(t_0 ) ~ y(t_0)~ </S>",
    "<S> .    to summarize , under a reasonably plausible assumption on the susy breaking during the primordial inflation and in the present universe , the model with the superpotential ( [ model-1 ] ) can successfully realize the desired cosmological evolution of the three relevant scales : the axion scale , the weak scale , and the qcd scale as given by ( [ vev1 ] ) , ( [ vev2 ] ) and ( [ vev3 ] ) . being generated by susy breaking , an inflationary axion scale @xmath115 is determined to be well above the present axion scale @xmath116 , and a stronger qcd in the early universe is realized to yield an enough suppression of the axion angle fluctuation even when @xmath22 saturates its upper bound . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the minimum of the axion potential induced by the stronger qcd depends on @xmath117 , but not on @xmath118 , while the minimum of the axion potential at present depends on @xmath118 , but not on @xmath117 . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the stronger qcd generates an axion misalignment angle @xmath119 , so that the axion dark matter with @xmath40 arises naturally in our scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a remaining issue which should be addressed to complete our scheme . </S>",
    "<S> as we have noticed , the @xmath0-transition is foregone by a late - time thermal inflation . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the scheme should be accompanied by a late - time baryogenesis operating after the @xmath0-transition . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the model of ( [ model-1 ] ) offers an elegant mechanism to generate the baryon asymmetry through the rolling flat direction @xmath120 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more detailed cosmology of our scheme , including the leptogenesis by rolling @xmath120 , will be discussed elsewhere @xcite . </S>"
