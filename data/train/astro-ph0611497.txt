    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) constitutes one of the most powerful tools in cosmology today .",
    "observations of the angular power spectrum of the cmb intensity and polarisation anisotropies are providing constraints at the level of few percent on the values of the cosmological parameters describing our universe within the standard cosmological scenario , ( e.g. @xcite ) . moreover , because these anisotropies are intricately linked to the initial conditions in our universe , they can also be used as a probe of inflation and fundamental physics . microwave intensity ( or temperature ) anisotropies have recently been measured in the whole sky from large to medium ( @xmath5 ) angular scales by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ , ( wmap ) .",
    "wmap measurements have been complemented by other ground - based high - angular resolution cmb experiments @xcite with partial sky coverage .",
    "+ on the other hand , the study of the cmb polarisation anisotropies is just starting : experiments like capmap @xcite and cbi @xcite announced the first detection of cmb polarisation anisotropies in subdegree angular scales , whereas wmap s team managed to separate large - scale cmb polarisation anisotropies from the dominant contamining signals produced in our galaxy . indeed ,",
    "when trying to achieve better constraints on the theoretical models and to test the inflationary predictions , polarisation measurements are known to play an important role in breaking some of the degeneracies present in the parameters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , a particular type of cmb polarisation anisotropies having particular symmetry properties ( the so - called @xmath6 modes of polarisation ) are known to be closely related to tensorial modes in the metric perturbations ( that is , _ gravitational waves _ ) generated during the inflationary epoch .",
    "therefore , it is easy to understand that the search for these polarisation anisotropies provides a unique test for both the cosmological model and fundamental physics , since to date no detection of gravitational waves has been reported .",
    "for this reason , in the last few years an important effort has been put into measuring the polarisation angular power spectrum of the cmb , and consequently there is already a considerable number of projects ( clover , quiet , cmbpol ) pursuing the detection of the primordial b - mode of the cmb polarisation anisotropies .",
    "the predicted sensitivities of these experiments ( @xmath7 to @xmath8  @xmath9 ) will open the possibility to investigate additional interesting effects whose amplitudes were regarded as unreachable .",
    "in particular , the resonant scattering on hydrogen balmer and paschen lines at the epoch of recombination ( @xmath10 ) is known to produce frequency - dependent temperature anisotropies in the sub - degree angular scales of the cmb , @xcite .",
    "these same lines are known to give rise to spectral distortions in the cmb black body spectrum @xcite , at the relative level of @xmath11 , and in general of the order of @xmath12 for higher series .",
    "here we analyse the changes that these transitions introduce in the polarisation angular spectrum , and make definite predictions for the standard model of recombination .",
    "the amplitudes of the changes in the polarisation power spectrum are found to be comparable to the typical amplitudes of the b modes for values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath13 .",
    "these signals should constitute a new probe for the end of recombination process , and may provide information about cosmological parameters and their evolution with time .",
    "another physical process that upcoming cmb experiments may be sensitive to is the resonant scattering off metals and molecules at high redsfhift .",
    "this idea is not new , and several authors have studied the effect of molecules ( lih , dh@xmath14 ) on the cmb radiation at high redshift , both from the theoretical @xcite or the observational point of view , @xcite . in @xcite ( hereafter bhms ) , a detailed theoretical study of the effect of resonant scattering of cmb photons off metals and ions was presented . in that work",
    ", it was shown that different observing frequencies would probe the resonant scattering at different redshifts .",
    "for this reason , the comparison of cmb maps obtained at different frequencies should provide information of the metal enrichment history of the universe .",
    "this is essentially a consequence of the frequency dependent optical depth ( @xmath15 ) that these resonant transitions give rise to . in their analysis",
    ", bhms studied fine structure transitions of atoms and ions ( ci , cii , nii , niii , oi , oiii , etc ) , and found that the scattering process should be dominant over collisional excitation .",
    "further , they exploited the fact that , as shown in @xcite , the changes in the cmb temperature angular power spectrum are linear in @xmath15 , and proposed a method to extract the metal induced signal in upcoming cmb data sets .",
    "@xcite addressed the requirements that future cmb data must fulfill in order to be sensitive to the metal - induced signal . among all of them , the most demanding was the cross - channel calibration , whose relative uncertainty had to be below @xmath15 , i.e. , better than @xmath16 .",
    "point spread function reconstruction errors were found not to be very critical .",
    "the observing channels should be placed in an optimal frequency range of [ 100 , 350 ] ghz , enabling an accurate subtraction of the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect , @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the changes that resonant scattering off metals introduce in the cmb polarisation angular power spectrum . the amplitude of these changes is found to be extremely small , still a factor 10  100 below the nominal sensitivity of proposed b - mode experiments .",
    "however , they would provide a parallel test for the enrichment history of the universe , and help to distinguish the oi among other likely resonant species , like nii , niii , ci , cii or even oiii .",
    "this study should be understood in the context of proposed cmb polarisation measurements , that attempt to measure primordial b - modes of typical amplitudes @xmath17 @xmath9 .",
    "distinguishing signals of such small amplitudes demands stringent requirements not only on the sensitivity side , but also ( and perhaps more importantly ) on the systematic / foreground side : contaminants are now known to be orders of magnitude larger that the targeted b - modes , and their exquisite control and removal will be absolutely demandatory .",
    "the signals we are addressing in this paper have comparable amplitudes to the intrinsic b - modes : if the latter are finally measured , then these signals , containing a wealth of information about the recombination and reionisation histories of our universe , may be accessible too .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we implement the theory of resonant scattering in the context of cmb angular anisotropies . in section 3",
    "we apply our formalism to the polarisation changes introduced by the resonant scattering on @xmath2 and @xmath3 lines of hydrogen during cosmological recombination . in section 4 we address the resonant scattering on metals and ions during the end of the dark ages and the beginning of reionisation .",
    "we discuss our results and conclude in section 5 .",
    "we start by reviewing well known results on resonance radiation and cmb polarisation .",
    "these are combined in the next subsection in order to compute the changes in the cmb polarisation power spectrum for different types of transitions .",
    "the reader familiar with the formalism introduced here may therefore prefer to skip this subsection and continue in the next one .",
    "an analysis of the polarisation state of resonance radiation coming out of a generic atomic system is presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their main result is that the resonant scattering is very close to rayleigh scattering , although in the general case it gives rise to a smaller degree of polarisation .",
    "indeed , the resonant scattering can be decomposed into a rayleigh - like scattering term ( i.e. , with its same angular dependence ) and an isotropic scattering term . if @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the incident light intensities parallel and perpendicular to the scattering plane in a solid angle element around direction @xmath20 , then the scattered counterparts ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) along direction @xmath23 are given by @xmath24 @xmath25\\ ;   \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } i_{\\parallel } ' \\\\ i_{\\perp } ' \\end{array } \\right ) \\ ; d\\omega({\\hat{\\mbox{\\bf { n } } } ' } ) .",

    "the values of @xmath1 and @xmath28 depend on the initial value and change of the quantum number describing the angular momenta involved in the resonant transition , @xcite .",
    "we next write the radiative transfer equation for this scattering in terms of the stokes parameters i ( @xmath31 ) and q ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "this scattering produces no circular polarisation , so the stokes parameter v will be ignored .",
    "we study the radiation coming from an arbitrary point @xmath23 on the celestial sphere .",
    "our axes used to define the parallel ( @xmath33 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath34 ) directions are determined by the meridian and azymuthal directions at @xmath23 , respectively . as shown in @xcite , in order to compute the parameters i@xmath35 and q@xmath35 in this reference frame , it is necessary to integrate in all possible directions @xmath20 of incoming radiation . in this step",
    ", one must account for the different reference frames being involved . since our scattering matrices ( eq.([eq : rseq1 ] ) ) are defined with respect to the plane of scattering , it is necessary to make two transformations of the intensities : the first one projects intensities at @xmath20 into the axes parallel and normal to the scattering plane , whereas the second transforms the scattered intensities into our reference frame at @xmath23 . under an infinitesimally small optical depth due to the resonant transition ( @xmath36 ) , the radiative transfer equation yields the following changes in the i and q parameters for the resonant scattering : @xmath37 @xmath38 .",

    "this expression meets the standard rayleigh scattering limit if @xmath42 , and shows how the intensity quadrupole alone ( @xmath43 ) acts as a source for linear polarisation . at the same time",
    ", it is clear that different resonant transitions with different @xmath1 coefficients give rise to different levels of polarisation .",
    "we shall show below that this fact may have its relevance , since polarisation measurements may distinguish among different candidate resonant species otherwise undiscernible with intensity measurements only : the polarisation term @xmath44 is typically a few percent of @xmath45 , and this fact largely hides the value of @xmath1 from intensity observations .    in a cosmological context , we follow @xcite to describe the evolution of the perturbations of the photon field .",
    "they work in fourier space , and therefore the photon distribution function @xmath46 is _ a priori _ dependent on comoving wavemodes @xmath47 , photon momenta @xmath48 and conformal time @xmath49 .",
    "however , in cosmological perturbation theory , due to a symmetry present in the evolution equations , it is customary to work with the simplifying assumption that @xmath50 depends on the direction of the photon momentum @xmath51 via the dot product @xmath52 only , ( @xmath53 being the modulus of @xmath47 and @xmath54 the modulus of @xmath48 ) .",

    "the 63.2 @xmath4 m oi line ( thin solid line ) becomes prominent at @xmath194 ghz , and in case b scenario where there is little nii ( since most of nitrogen is in form of niii ) clearly dominates the total optical depth in a narrow redshift range .",
    "since the polarisation coefficient associated to this transition is relatively low ( @xmath195 ) , it leaves a distinctive signature in the @xmath196 .",
    "of course , these conclusions are consequences of our particular choice of reionisation models , and are not generic .",
    "+ nevertheless , from a general point of view it is possible to state that the oi 63.2 @xmath4 m transition will always leave the signature in the form of very low polarisation parameter @xmath196 , enabling its isolation from the rest of resonant lines .",
    "further , it is a prediction for all models that the polarisation coefficient should increase with increasing frequency , since in this regime it would be dominated by the ionised species oiii , nii and cii .",
    "the measurement of polarisation anisotropies generated during reionisation via cmb scattering off metals would not only provide a consistency check for the detection in the temperature / intensity side , but would also shed more light on how reionisation took place .",
    "however , the detection of these polarisation anisotropies would require sensitivities of the order of 1100 @xmath197k , and currently this is beyond the scope of most cmb polarisation projects .",
    "the measurement and interpretation of the polarisation _ intrinsic _ anisotropies of the cmb has remarkably tightened the constraints on several cosmological parameters , @xcite .",
    "however , their characterisation is hampered by their low amplitude and the presence of contaminating signals .",
    "to date only anisotropies of the e mode of polarisation have been detected , but the detection of the b mode is currently the main goal of many ambitious cmb projects .",
    "the main difficulty that these projects will have to overcome is not only the extremely demanding level of sensitivity required to measure such a small signal , but also the exquisite control of systematics and foregrounds contaminants , the latter being usually orders of magnitude above the pursued component .",
    "+ in this context , we have presented a study of the secondary anisotropies of the cmb polarisation field caused via resonant scattering in two different scenarios : the cosmological recombination and the cosmological reionisation . in both cases ,",
    "the new polarisation anisotropies are e type , but of smaller amplitude than the intrinsic e type cmb polarisation fluctuations . in the recombination scenario",
    ", we have focused our analyses on the @xmath2 line , giving rise to the largest signal among all other transitions .",
    "we have found a definite and distinctive pattern in multipole and frequency space for the change of the te and ee power spectra .",
    "this effect takes place in the frequency range @xmath198 $ ] ghz , and is maximum at multipoles @xmath199 .",
    "the amplitudes of these signals are in general comparable to those of the intrinsic b - mode polarisation anisotropies . in a scenario where cmb experiments have the sensitivity and systematics control level required to characterise the b - mode anisotropies , the access to the study of the fluctuations introduced by the @xmath2 line should be then reachable .",
    "+ the polarisation anisotropies introduced by resonant scattering off metals during reionisation would provide a concluding consistency check for the measurements carried out in the intensity / temperature side . at the same time , they would shed some light on _ which _ transitions are responsible for most of the measured effect .",
    "in particular , the oi 63.2 @xmath4 m line tends to lower the average polarisation coefficient @xmath1 generated by all species , since it conserves very little memory of the polarisation of the scattered photon ( @xmath200 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the dominant transitions associated to highly ionised species , like ciii and oiii , show relatively high values of @xmath1 , ( @xmath201 $ ] ) .",
    "the requirements for detecting these signals are , however , even more demanding than in the recombination scenario : typical amplitudes are closer to the @xmath197k level than to the @xmath4k level , even below the amplitudes expected for the primordial b - mode polarisation anisotropies .",
    "the final detectability of this signal will be critically associated with the detectability of the primordial b - mode anisotropies : if the latter , at the end of the day , can be characterised with some given accuracy , then the possibility of pursuing signals that are still 5 to 50 times smaller could be formally addressed .",
