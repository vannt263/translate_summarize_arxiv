    "since the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials @xcite , the hubbard and @xmath4-@xmath5 models have been of central importance in strongly correlated electron systems . however , due to their strong coupling , a systematic analytic treatment of these models is currently not available .",
    "similarly , a severe sign problem away from half - filling prevents us from understanding these systems quantitatively by reliable monte carlo calculations . despite these difficulties",
    ", much effort has been devoted to understanding the properties of @xmath4-@xmath5-type models on the square lattice .",
    "although some controversial results have been obtained , various studies including exact diagonalization @xcite , series expansion @xcite , and monte carlo simulations @xcite enable us to understand the hole - dynamics quantitatively , at least to some extent .",
    "in particular , these studies all obtained minima of the single - hole dispersion relation at lattice momenta @xmath10 in the brillouin zone of the square lattice which is in agreement with experimental results  @xcite .    a reliable and order - by - order exact way to investigate the low - energy physics of lightly doped antiferromagnets is provided by a systematic low - energy effective field theory .",
    "the physics of the undoped systems is quantitatively described by magnon chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , while the interactions of magnons and holes are described by a low - energy effective theory for hole - doped antiferromagnets   @xcite .",
    "predictions of the effective theory only depend on a small number of low - energy constants which can be determined from either experiments or monte carlo data .",
    "thus , the use of low - energy effective theories together with reliable monte carlo simulations provides an unbiased approach to studying the low - energy physics of these systems .",
    "in particular , using the loop - cluster algorithm @xcite , the low - energy parameters of the spin @xmath11 heisenberg model have been determined with very high precision @xcite .",
    "indeed , thanks to the combination of very efficient monte carlo simulations with the systematic low - energy effective field theory , undoped antiferromagnets on the square lattice like la@xmath2cuo@xmath12 and sr@xmath2cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 are among the quantitatively best understood condensed matter systems .",
    "in addition to the cuprates , another superconducting material , na@xmath0coo@xmath1yh@xmath2o , has drawn a lot of attention both theoretically and experimentally . unfortunately , due to the fact that the underlying lattice geometry of the spin @xmath11 cobalt sites in these materials is triangular  which leads to strong geometric frustration  a first principles monte carlo study is impossible in practice .",
    "nevertheless , the spin- and charge - ordering tendencies observed and studied in @xcite may suggest that at filling @xmath13 , the unhydrated parent compound na@xmath0coo@xmath2 can be described by the @xmath4-@xmath5 model on a half - filled honeycomb lattice which allows one to simulate the system efficiently with the loop - cluster algorithm .",
    "another system on the honeycomb lattice that has been investigated with great vigor is graphene  a single sheet of graphite ( see @xcite for a detailed review ) . as a consequence of the geometry of the honeycomb lattice ,",
    "the low - energy excitations of graphene are massless dirac fermions .",
    "if some variants of graphene exists at stronger coupling , one eventually expects a phase transition separating graphene s unbroken phase from a strong coupling antiferromagnetic phase in which the @xmath14 spin symmetry is spontaneously broken to @xmath15 .",
    "the low - energy effective theory of the unbroken phase and of the critical point has been constructed in @xcite .    motivated by possible applications to na@xmath0coo@xmath2",
    ", we investigate the spin @xmath11 heisenberg model as well as the @xmath4-@xmath5 model on the honeycomb lattice by using the quantum monte carlo method . just as in the square lattice case ,",
    "the long - distance physics of these models is described quantitatively by a systematic low - energy effective field theory . at low energies , the heisenberg model on a bipartite lattice",
    "is described by magnon chiral perturbation theory , and , accordingly , the @xmath4-@xmath5 model is described by a low - energy effective field theory for magnons and holes .",
    "based on the same method that has been used in the square lattice case , we have constructed the leading - order terms in the action of a systematic low - energy effective field theory for magnons and holes on the honeycomb lattice . in this paper",
    ", we determine the corresponding leading - order low - energy constants , namely the staggered magnetization per spin @xmath16 , the spin stiffness @xmath17 , the spin wave velocity @xmath18 , and the kinetic mass @xmath9 of a doped hole by fitting the monte carlo data to the effective field theory predictions .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ micro ] , we introduce the relevant microscopic models as well as corresponding observables .",
    "section [ lowen ] reviews the low - energy effective theory for magnons , and section [ deter ] is devoted to the monte carlo determination of the corresponding low - energy parameters .",
    "the single - hole physics is investigated in section [ singl ] , and the effective theory for holes and magnons is discussed in section [ effec ] .",
    "finally , section [ concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "in this section we introduce the hamiltonians of the microscopic @xmath4-@xmath5 model and the heisenberg model as well as some relevant observables .",
    "the @xmath4-@xmath5 model is defined by the hamilton operator @xmath19 here @xmath20 and @xmath21 are fermion creation and annihilation operators at a site @xmath22 with @xmath23 whose components obey standard anticommutation relations . in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath24 the local spin operator at a site @xmath22 is given by @xmath25 the projection operator @xmath26 restricts the hilbert space by eliminating doubly occupied sites .",
    "hence the @xmath4-@xmath5 model allows empty or singly occupied sites only .",
    "the hopping of fermions is controlled by the parameter @xmath4 , while @xmath27 is the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between neighboring spins . at half - filling",
    ", the @xmath4-@xmath5 model reduces to the heisenberg model with the hamiltonian @xmath28    the honeycomb lattice with periodic spatial boundary conditions implemented in our simulations is depicted in figure 1 .",
    "the dashed rectangle in figure 1 , which contains @xmath29 spins , is the elementary cell for building a periodic honeycomb lattice covering a rectangular area .",
    "for instance , the honeycomb lattice shown in figure 1 contains 3 @xmath30 3 elementary cells .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath31 is the distance between two neighboring sites .",
    "the honeycomb lattice is not a bravais lattice .",
    "instead it consists of two triangular bravais sub - lattices @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( depicted by solid and open circles in figure 1 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the momentum space of the honeycomb lattice is a doubly - covered brillouin zone of the two triangular sub - lattices ( depicted in figure 2 ) .",

    "due to the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath14 spin symmetry down to its @xmath15 subgroup , the low - energy physics of antiferromagnets is governed by two massless goldstone bosons , the antiferromagnetic spin waves or magnons .",
    "the description of the low - energy magnon physics by an effective theory was pioneered by chakravarty , halperin , and nelson in @xcite . in analogy to chiral perturbation theory for the pseudo - goldstone pions in qcd , a systematic low - energy effective field theory for magnons",

    "we want to point out that our results are obtained by fitting more than @xmath92 numerical data points to two analytic predictions with only 3 unknown parameters . if @xmath16 is fixed to @xmath93 , the quality of our fit downgrades to @xmath94 .",
    "the reduction of @xmath6 and @xmath95 on the honeycomb lattice compared to those on the square lattice ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 @xcite ) indicates larger quantum fluctuations on the honeycomb lattice .",
