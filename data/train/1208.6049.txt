    "quantum estimation considers situations in which a quantum system or evolution operation depends on one or more parameters , the values of which are to be estimated as accurately as possible .",
    "such estimation will have to be accomplished by subjecting physical systems to physical procedures and consequently the accuracy of estimates will be governed by the relevant laws of physics .",
    "this realization has resulted in substantial study of constraints and quantum advantages available for estimation in the context of quantum theory and has yielded results with important implications for quantum metrology  @xcite .",
    "in general , any quantum estimation procedure considers a quantum operation of known form but which depends on one or more parameters .",
    "the focus of this article is the pauli operation ( or channel ) , @xmath2 , which acts on a single qubit .",
    "this transforms a system , initially in the state @xmath3 , via @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a pauli operator with @xmath7 represent a direction in space .",
    "for example , @xmath8 represents the bit - flip operation and @xmath9 is the phase - flip operation .",
    "the assumption is that the direction @xmath7 is known but the parameter @xmath10 is unknown .",
    "the task is to estimate @xmath10 with minimal uses of physical resources , such as qubits , number of applications of the channel or ancillary quantum operations .",
    "channels of this type are important for the following reasons .",
    "first , the three channels for which @xmath11 and @xmath12 are sufficient to generate the types of errors that are considered in quantum information processing  @xcite . estimating their strengths via",
    "the parameters will be relevant for practical quantum information processing protocols .",
    "second , specific examples of such channels appear in contexts such as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , in which the phase - flip operation generates the dephasing ( or @xmath13 ) processes  @xcite . here",
    ", the density operator of a single spin-1/2 system evolves with time @xmath14 as @xmath15 where @xmath13 is a constant with units of time .",
    "this is related to the phase - flip parameter by @xmath16 measuring or estimating the phase - flip parameter is thus equivalent to measuring @xmath17    third , quantum parameter estimation can illustrate fundamental differences between classical and quantum worlds .",
    "for example , consider two methods of estimating the parameter governing unitary phase shifts  @xcite . applying the unitary phase operation once to each of @xmath7 independent quantum systems , yields an optimal uncertainty of @xmath18 , also called the standard quantum limit .",
    "this is analogous to a classical repetition and averaging procedure .",
    "a method which applies the unitary phase operation once to each of @xmath7 quantum systems which are initially in a particular entangled state yields an uncertainty of @xmath19 .",
    "this is the heisenberg quantum limit and is optimal for this type of operation  @xcite .",
    "evidently the resource of entanglement , occurring in quantum systems , has yielded an advantage here .",
    "parameter estimation for pauli channels has been considered in the context of finding an optimal scheme using all possible input states of the quantum systems involved  @xcite .",
    "the results , reviewed in section  [ sec : input ] , are that the optimal accuracy can be attained when the channel is invoked multiple times on independent and unentangled systems , each of which is initially in a pure state  @xcite .",
    "the manifestly quantum resource of entanglement has no role to play in this circumstance .",
    "however , in situations such as solution state nmr , initial states are highly mixed .",
    "the question remains of whether an independent channel invocation approach is still optimal when the only initial states available are mixed .",
    "this variant of quantum parameter estimation has been investigated for unitary operations  @xcite where advantages of the type using entangled pure states survived with mixed , correlated initial states .    in this article",
    "we consider the question of pauli channel parameter estimation when the initial states of the available quantum systems are mixed .",
    "we aim to compare the accuracy of an independent channel use approach to one where correlated or entangled states are used",
    ". this will be important for pauli channels in solution state nmr and other situations where the initial states are inherently mixed .",
    "particularly , for nmr it is not practical to purify the state by a process of measurement followed by selection based on measurement outcomes ; the full range of available initial does not include pure states .",
    "our approach is similar to that of modi , et .",
    "@xcite but the results are subtly different , particularly in terms of the relationship between the presence of entanglement or discord when improved accuracy is attained .",
    "we shall focus on the phase - flip channel but the results hold for any pauli channel .",
    "section  [ sec : genestimation ] reviews the general framework for quantum parameter estimation and general bounds for phase - flip parameter estimation .",
    "section  [ sec : input ] describes initial states available and gives the optimal independent channel use estimation accuracy ; this provides a `` classical '' benchmark against which other schemes can be compared .",
    "section  [ sec : correst ] outlines a particular approach that uses correlated quantum states and gives central new results which form the foundation our the rest of the article .",
    "sections  [ sec : correstone ] and  [ sec : correstmany ] describe two cases of the main result with notably different outcomes .",
    "finally section  [ sec : entangdisc ] discusses the presence of correlations such as entanglement or quantum discord in our estimation schemes .",
    "typically a physical quantum estimation procedure commences with various quantum systems prepared in known initial states .",
    "the parameter dependent operation is applied multiple times to some of these systems , possibly interspersed with ancillary parameter - independent quantum operations .",
    "the physical procedure terminates with measurements on the individual quantum systems .",
    "the parameter is inferred by data processing from the measurement outcomes .",
    "[ fig : generalscheme ] illustrates a generic quantum estimation scheme which uses @xmath0 invocations of the operation and @xmath7 quantum systems .",
    "quantum systems , each represented by a horizontal line .",
    "this procedure uses @xmath0 invocations of the parameter - dependent operation @xmath20 interspersed with parameter - independent unitary transformations @xmath21 the initial state of all quantum systems is @xmath22 and the pre - measurement state @xmath23 measurements on individual systems follow the final unitary @xmath24 [ fig : generalscheme ] ]    the general probabilistic nature of the outcomes of measurements on quantum systems means that the parameter inferences will fluctuate about the true parameter value .",
    "a key goal of any parameter estimation scheme is to minimize these fluctuations .",
    "various estimation schemes use differing resources ( e.g.  number of qubits , number of channel invocations , number of two qubit entangling unitaries ) and a fair comparison requires precise specification of the resource costs .",
    "a common assessment of the resource cost uses a black - box query count within a quantum circuit  @xcite such as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : generalscheme ] . in this approach , used in this article , the only relevant resource cost is the number of times , @xmath25 that the phase - flip operation appears in the quantum circuit for the protocol .",
    "we will only compare schemes that use the same number of channel invocations .    in the scheme of fig .",
    "[ fig : generalscheme ] , @xmath22 can be assumed to be a product of states for the individual qubits since an potential entangled state can be generated from this via an appropriate unitary , which can be subsumed into @xmath26 given this , estimation schemes can broadly be grouped into two classes .    in the first , called an _ independent channel use protocol , _ the channel is applied once to each of @xmath0 qubits , which are initially in a product state .",
    "this is followed by measurements . in the context of fig .",
    "[ fig : generalscheme ] this means that all of @xmath27 are non - entangling amongst the qubits ( a non - entangling unitary transforms any state which is a product of states for individual quantum systems to another such product state ) . in this protocol",
    "@xmath28 is a product of single qubit unitaries while @xmath29 are products of single qubit unitaries sandwiched between two qubit swap gates . throughout the procedure of this protocol",
    "the state of the entire system is always a product of states for the individual qubits and there are no quantum correlations present .",
    "the independent channel use protocol is analogous to the classical strategy of invoking the physical operation independently on multiple physical systems ; this generally enhances estimation accuracy .    in the second approach ,",
    "called a _ correlated state protocol _ and only available to quantum systems , at least one of @xmath30 is an entangling unitary and , at some point during the procedure , the system will not be in a product state .",
    "the task of schemes falling into either class is to find admissible unitaries @xmath30 that maximize the estimation for fixed resource costs . the question is whether there is some correlated state protocol that provides better estimation accuracy that any independent state protocol .",
    "if so , it would indicate that some quantum resources , possibly generated by an entangling unitary , have been harnessed so as to outperform any estimation protocol merely analogous to the classical strategy of repetition , as employed by an independent channel use protocol .      quantifying the accuracy of quantum estimation procedures",
    "is done using the following general scheme . denoting the outcome of the measurement on the @xmath31 system by @xmath32 the collective outcomes of the physical procedure of fig .",
    "[ fig : generalscheme ] can be represented by @xmath33 .",
    "the parameter is estimated by applying these an _ estimator function _",
    ", @xmath34 resulting in the estimate , @xmath35 . as a result of statistical fluctuations in measurement outcomes , inherent in quantum systems ,",
    "the same estimator will yield possibly different results from one run to another which uses an identical sequence of quantum operations .",
    "the statistical accuracy of the estimate will therefore rely on the choice of estimator together with the probability distribution for the measurement outcomes .",
    "one means of quantifying the accuracy of this estimate uses the mean square error , @xmath36 where the angle brackets indicate the mean over all possible measurement outcomes .",

    "regardless of the estimator function , the variance is bounded from below via the cramr - rao bound _ @xmath40 where @xmath41 @xmath42 ^ 2\\ ;                   \\ ;                   \\mathrm{d}x_1 \\ldots",

    "if each measurement outcome is one of a set of discrete possibilities , the integral is replaced by a summation .    it can be shown that under general conditions , there is always an estimator  @xcite , which asymptotically saturates the bound of eq .  .",
    "thus in classical parameter estimation the fisher information quantifies accuracy of the estimate and when comparing estimation schemes , that with the greater fisher information is more successful than any competitor with a lower fisher information .    given a particular estimation procedure with fisher information , @xmath44 an obvious and conventional classical strategy for improvement is to repeat the identical procedure multiple times independently .",
