    "quantum adiabatic algorithms , first conceived in ref .",
    "@xcite , have been developed as an alternative to the traditional circuit model of quantum computation .",
    "an important aspect of the adiabatic approach is its expected resilience to various kinds of open system effects , which makes it a promising candidate for robust quantum computation .",
    "the basic reason for this appealing feature is that the adiabatic quantum computer operates near the instantaneous ground state of a time - dependent hamiltonian and can therefore be expected to be insensitive to relaxation and open system effects among the excited states .",
    "the robustness of adiabatic quantum computation has been discussed in the literature for different kinds of perturbations , such as relaxation @xcite , noise @xcite , decoherence @xcite , and unitary control errors @xcite .    in this paper , we elaborate on the robustness of the quantum adiabatic search @xcite in the presence of decoherence in the instantaneous eigenbasis of the search hamiltonian . in particular , we extend the analysis of the local search @xcite in ref .",
    "@xcite to global adiabatic search @xcite .",
    "we further address the dependence of the asymptotic time complexity of the search procedure on the success probability for finding the searched item .    to model adiabatic search in the presence of decoherence we consider master equations of the form ( @xmath4 from now on ) @xmath5 -b\\bm{[}w,[w,\\varrho]\\bm{]},\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the density operator , and @xmath7 are constants such that @xmath8 . for convenience",
    ", we also assume that @xmath9 .",
    "the operator @xmath10 is taken to be the time - dependent hamiltonian of the adiabatic search @xcite , and @xmath11 is a time - dependent hermitian operator such that @xmath12 = 0 $ ] , which gives decoherence in the instantaneous eigenbasis of @xmath10 .",
    "decoherence with respect to the energy eigenbasis of a system has been shown to occur in certain regimes of system - environment interaction @xcite . apart from this general regime of weak interaction and dominating self - hamiltonians",
    "one can find other settings where this type of decoherence occurs .",
    "one example is control errors in terms of fluctuations in the energy levels of the system @xcite .",
    "note also that decoherence in the energy eigenbasis does not necessarily imply the particular form of eq .",
    "( [ enkel ] ) .",
    "however , this choice provides a sufficiently simple model to be treated analytically , and yet results in non - trivial behavior .",
    "moreover , the form of eq .",
    "( [ enkel ] ) quite generally guarantees the solution to be a proper density operator at all times .",
    "our results show that for @xmath13 and list length @xmath1 , it is sufficient with a run time of the order @xmath1 in the global case and @xmath14 in the local case , as is the case for the ideal closed evolution .",
    "these results suggest that the adiabatic quantum computer is protected against this type of decoherence , which is promising for physical realizations . in the wide - open case where @xmath15 @xcite , with the special choice @xmath16 , the scaling changes to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , for the global and local search , respectively .",
    "although the concept of adiabaticity has a well defined meaning for closed systems , there is no obviously unique generalization to the case of open systems .",
    "one may consider several different generalizations focusing on various aspects of the standard adiabaticity .",
    "for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite the concept of adiabaticity is based upon jordan block decompositions of the superoperator that describe the evolution of the open system . a different approach , designed for systems that are weakly open , has been put forward in ref .",
    "this latter approach is based upon taking decoupling of the energy subspaces of the ideal hamiltonian as the starting point . here",
    ", we use a third method based upon a feature of the adiabatic quantum computer , namely that the evolution takes place near an eigenstate of the ideal hamiltonian .",
    "this property is in contrast with , e.g. , implementations of holonomic quantum gates @xcite , where it is essential that the gate can operate on arbitrary superpositions , without too large errors . for the functioning of the adiabatic quantum computer , however , it is sufficient that the state of the system remains close to the correct eigenstate . in the present interpretation of the word `` adiabaticity ''",
    "we only require that the probabilities of finding the system in the instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath17 are conserved , but we allow superpositions of the instantaneous eigenstates to decay into mixtures .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : twolev ] we derive an integral equation from the original master equation . section [ sec : search ] gives a brief overview of the adiabatic search algorithm , and we calculate some quantities which are used later . in sec .",
    "[ sec : semiopen ] we prove a sufficient condition for the success probability of the adiabatic search to approach unity in the semi - open case .",
    "we consider both global and local search .",
    "furthermore , a condition on the decoherence term of the master equation , which is used in the proofs in sec .",
    "[ sec : semiopen ] , is examined . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wopen ] we demonstrate that the wide - open case is essentially different from the semi - open case .",

    "we further prove that the sufficient conditions are also necessary . in sec .",
    "[ sec : success ] , bounds on the run time for fixed success probabilities less that unity , are given .",
    "we end with the conclusions .",
    "in this section we develop the basic equation used in our analysis . since it is our intention to use adiabaticity we consider a fixed family of hamiltonians @xmath17 , parametrized , in a sufficiently smooth way , by the parameter @xmath18 .",

    "[ fig : globalw ] and [ fig : localw ] one may obtain an intuitive understanding of the `` discontinuity '' of the scaling of the run times , when going from the semi - open to the wide - open case .",
    "the closer we get to the wide - open case ( i.e. , the closer @xmath503 gets to @xmath286 ) , the higher up in list - lengths the curve `` follows '' the curve of the wide - open case , before it turns to its asymptotic slope . in this context",
    "one should also note that for every fixed list - length @xmath1 , the system is continuous with respect to @xmath503 .",
    "in other words , the discontinuity only appears for the asymptotes in the @xmath505 limit , not in any system corresponding to a fixed list .",
    "the list - length @xmath1 corresponds to the dimension of the total hilbert space , but in the effective two - dimensional hilbert space the list - length only enters as a parameter in the hamiltonian . if we are to understand the discontinuity of the asymptotic scaling as a function of the degree of openness , in the case @xmath231 , we may consider how the parameter @xmath1 enters the terms @xmath506 $ ] and @xmath507 $ ] in the master equation .",
    "the minimum energy gap of the hamiltonian is proportional to @xmath508 .",
    "thus , at the minimum gap the list length @xmath1 enters as @xmath509 in the hamiltonian part of the master equation , but as @xmath510 in the decohering part .",
    "no matter how small @xmath482 is , as long as it is nonzero , @xmath509 always dominates @xmath510 in the limit of large @xmath1 .",
    "although this , strictly speaking , only holds at @xmath511 , it seems intuitively reasonable that the hamiltonian term dominates the evolution , for large @xmath1 , as long as @xmath512 .",
    "intuitively it also seems reasonable that if the hamiltonian dominates the evolution , then the hamiltonian determines the asymptotic scaling of the run time , and thus the scaling becomes the one of the ideal closed case .",
    "however , if @xmath375 then the decohering term determines the scaling .",
    "we investigate the effect of decoherence on the adiabatic search of a marked element in a disordered list of @xmath1 elements .",
    "more specifically we consider decoherence with respect to the instantaneous eigenbasis of the adiabatic search hamiltonian .",
    "the decoherence is modeled by using a master equation of the form @xmath513 -b\\bm{[}w,[w,\\rho]\\bm{]}$ ] ( with @xmath514 ) , where @xmath10 is the time - dependent search hamiltonian and @xmath11 is a time - dependent hermitian operator that commutes with @xmath10 .",
    "the operator @xmath11 is only subjected to the condition in eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) , which , in some sense , states that the fluctuations of @xmath11 ( with respect to time ) should not grow with the list - length @xmath1 .",
    "we prove sufficient conditions for the @xmath3 limit of the success probability @xmath262 . in the semi - open case ( @xmath13 )",
    "we prove that these sufficient conditions are @xmath515 and @xmath516 in the global and local search case , respectively , where @xmath24 is the run time of the adiabatic search .",
    "in other words , the results for the ideal adiabatic search ( @xmath94 ) remains valid even in the presence of decoherence with respect to the instantaneous eigenbasis .    in the wide - open case ( @xmath227 ) , sufficient and necessary conditions for the @xmath3 limit ,",
    "are deduced . in the case where @xmath16 we find that the conditions for @xmath3 are @xmath517 and @xmath141 for the global and local search , respectively .",
    "we finally investigate how the run time @xmath24 depends on @xmath1 for a fixed success probability @xmath262 less than unity .",
    "we find that it is sufficient with run times that scales like @xmath1 and @xmath14 , in the semi - open case , as for the ideal global and local adiabatic searches . in the wide - open case",
    "we instead find the scalings @xmath0 and @xmath1 , for the global and local search , respectively .    in view of these results the following picture emerges . in the semi - open cases",
    "the hamiltonian dynamics dominates the behavior of the system for sufficiently large list lengths . to be more precise , an increased degree of eigenbasis decoherence",
    "does increase the run time of the adiabatic search , but only through the constant @xmath217 of the asymptote @xmath518 . in the wide - open case ,",
    "however , the protective effect of the hamiltonian dynamics is not present .",
    "consequently , the asymptotic behavior depends directly on the choice of @xmath11 . as a consequence",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the wide - open case may be distinctly different from that of the semi - open case , although we have the same choice of @xmath11 .",
    "one may note that the abrupt change in asymptotic behavior with respect to the transition from semi - open to wide - open system , raises a warning sign concerning the use of the wide - open evolution as an approximation to an `` almost '' wide - open evolution .",
    "it should be noted , however , that for any fixed list length , the system is continuous with respect to the degree of openness , and that the discontinuity rather concerns the asymptotic scaling of the run time in the limit of large list - lengths .",
    "the decoherence model provided by eq .  ( [ enkel ] ) implies that we disregard the memory effects in the environment and the corresponding fluctuations , which seems justifiable if the relevant time scales of the evolution is much larger than the dominating time scales of the memory of the environment .",
    "the modeling of memory effects generally leads to integro - differential equations @xcite , or to time - local non - markovian equations @xcite . to include such effects into the analysis of the influence of the environment on the efficiency of the adiabatic quantum computer",
    "would be interesting but challenging .",
    "finally we note that , in spite of the apparent difference between the adiabatic quantum computing scheme and the traditional circuit model , it has been shown that these two models are , in a certain sense , equivalent @xcite .",
    "however , this equivalence does not concern the robustness to noise , relaxation , or decoherence .",
    "previous findings suggest that the adiabatic quantum computer to a certain extent should be resilient against various kinds of open system effects .",
    "the results of this paper provide further evidence for this .",
    "if we consider hamiltonians with a time - independent eigenbasis , then randomness in the eigenenergies causes decoherence with respect to the eigenstates , when averaged over several instances . although this gives rise to decoherence in the eigenbasis , it is not necessarily of a form that can be expressed as in eq .",
    "( [ enkel ] ) ; this depends on the statistics of the fluctuations . a time - independent two - level system with an energy gap that is drawn from an ensemble with lorentzian distribution , results in an averaged evolution that can be described by eq .  ( [ enkel ] ) with time - independent @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "( [ enkel ] ) the eigenbasis of the hamiltonian depends on time .",
    "however , in the adiabatic limit many aspects of the above time - independent case seems likely to be retained .",
