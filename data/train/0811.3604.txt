    "due to its interesting applicability , entanglement ( see e.g. @xcite ) is still one of the most interesting topics in modern physics .",
    "following @xcite , we call a state describing some finite  dimensional bipartite physical system @xmath4 and @xmath5 _ entangled _ if it can not be written as a mixture of product states .",
    "more precisely , @xmath6 is called _ entangled _ if it does not admit the following decomposition : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are density matrices representing subsystems @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in the case",
    "when @xmath6 can be written in the above form , it is called _ separable _ or _ classically correlated_.    one of the most important problems the scientists have to face is that there is no simple way of deciding if a given state @xmath6 is entangled or not .",
    "the general problem of separability remains unresolved despite the fact that huge effort has been expended so far to invent stronger and easier to apply separability criteria ( see e.g. @xcite and the recent review on the detection of entanglement @xcite ) . the task becomes even harder since most of the invented mathematical criteria are not directly applicable experimentally . in general , despite the case of pure states ( see @xcite ) and arbitrary two  qubit states ( see @xcite ) , there is no unambiguous method for deciding about separability that is promising from the experimental point of view .",
    "therefore , it is still desirable to look for separability criteria giving , on the one hand , mathematical possibility of detecting entanglement and , on the other hand , allowing for future experimental realizations .    still , one of the most significant separability criteria , but in general not directly realizable in experiment , are those based on positive maps .",
    "it was pointed out first for the partial transposition in @xcite and then generally in @xcite that a positive map can serve as a necessary separability criterion .",
    "that is , whenever @xmath6 is separable , the operator inequality @xmath9(\\varrho_{ab})\\geq 0\\ ] ] holds for all positive but not completely positive maps @xmath2 .",
    "here , by @xmath10 we denoted an identity map acting on the first subsystem .",
    "in fact , even a stronger statement is true @xcite , i.e. @xmath6 is separable if and only if condition ( [ operatorinequality ] ) is satisfied for all positive maps @xmath2 .",
    "exemplary maps serving commonly for the detection of entanglement are the reduction map @xcite @xmath11 with @xmath12 and the transposition map ( hereafter denoted by @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it was shown in @xcite that in the case of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 system the transposition map completely solves the separability problem , as in this case @xmath16(\\varrho_{ab})\\equiv\\varrho^{\\gamma}_{ab}\\geq 0 $ ] is a necessary and sufficient condition for separability . though the criteria can not be applied directly in experiment , some indirect methods were pointed out in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there also exist criteria that seem to be promising from the experimental point of view and can be given clear physical interpretation .",
    "among others are the so  called entropic inequalities .",
    "their meaning for detection of entanglement was first pointed out in @xcite , where it was shown that for separable states the von neumann conditional entropy satisfies @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the von neumann entropy @xmath19 .",
    "this means that in the case of separable states the whole system is more disordered than its subsystems .",
    "however , the nonnegativity of conditional entropy does not have to hold for all quantum states ( as it is easily seen in the case of pure entangled states ) .",
    "this phenomenon found its explanation in @xcite , where the conditional von neumann entropy was interpreted as the cost of merging of a bipartite state .",
    "the fact that for some entangled states this quantity can be negative is one of the basic features of quantum communication .",
    "further , in a series of papers @xcite , the property that for separable states the whole system is more disordered than the subsystems was formalized in terms of other disorder measures , for instance the quantum version of the renyi entropy @xcite ( or equivalently the tsallis entropy @xcite ) .",
    "this led to inequalities of the form @xmath20 with @xmath21\\log\\tr\\sigma^{\\alpha}$ ] ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "applicability in the detection of entanglement among many particular examples of quantum states were investigated in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "also , other entropic functions were studied in this context @xcite .",
    "this disorder rule was also connected to a more general disorder measure based on the concept of majorization ( the definition of majorization will be given in section 2 ) .",
    "in @xcite , it was shown that if @xmath6 is separable , then the following holds : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote vectors consisting of eigenvalues of @xmath6 and @xmath25 , respectively ( note that one has to add zeros to @xmath24 to have the same dimension as @xmath23 ) .",
    "the advantage of the entropic inequalities lies in the fact that they can be measured experimentally .",
    "more precisely , since they can be rewritten as @xmath26 @xmath27 they lead , for integer @xmath28 , to multicopy entanglement witnesses on @xmath28 copies of @xmath6 is @xmath29copy entanglement witness if its mean value on @xmath29 copies of any separable state is positive and is negative on at least one entangled state . ]",
    "@xcite . for @xmath30 ,",
    "this fact has already been already applied experimentally @xcite and a possible generalization to @xmath29qubit states was considered in @xcite .    on the other hand , both criteria ( majorization relations and entropic inequalities )",
    "were shown to follow from the reduction criterion @xcite .",
    "this means that they are useless in detecting entangled states with positive partial transposition ( ppt ) @xcite , since the reduction map is decomposable , and in general weak . in a series of two papers @xcite , the question about other entropic or entropic  like inequalities that could detect bound entanglement and",
    "could be realized experimentally was posed .",
    "the fact that the reduction criterion map leads to some scalar criteria suggests that it should be also possible to get some entropic  like inequalities from other maps , including indecomposable ones .",
    "using the fact that any positive map @xmath0 may be written as @xmath1 with @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) being two completely positive maps , the authors derived in @xcite a class of inequalities efficiently detecting entanglement .",
    "however , these inequalities can be applied only to states fulfilling some commutation relations .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to reexamine the question about the possibility of deriving entropic  like inequalities from any positive map , not only the reduction one , but without any additional assumptions on the state .",
    "analogously , we ask if there are some majorization criteria following from any positive map . this in turn , by the concept of the schur  convex functions , could give a general method of deriving scalar inequalities appropriate for experimental realization . in what follows",
    "we show that it is possible to get submajorization relations following from positive maps .",
    "then , we provide two methods allowing for the derivation of entropic inequalities .",
    "the first one is a simple consequence of the submajorization relations , while the second one is a continuation of the results from @xcite .",
    "both constructions give separability tests allowing for detection of ppt entangled states .",
    "interestingly , for states with one of the subsystems being in a maximally mixed state the derived inequalities are in some sense equivalent to the necessary condition based on the positive map from which they were derived . finally , the particular inequalities derived using the second method can be given some physical meaning in the context of state merging and approximation of a mean value of a linear entanglement witness .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ whatweknow ] contains various definitions concerning majorization , week majorization , positive maps and related concepts .",
    "the reader familiar with the subject matter can move straight to section [ inequalities ] , where the inequalities are presented together with some special cases and comments . in section [ comparison ] ,",
    "we analyze the effectiveness of the inequalities as a separability criterion .",
    "a summary of obtained results and some open questions are given in section [ conclusion_sec ] .",
    "in what follows we shall often refer to the notion of majorization .",
    "it is therefore desirable to recall the definition and some concepts closely related to it .",
    "the meaning of majorization in physics has already been recognized ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , majorization found its applications also in issues closely related to quantum information theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all the concepts appearing in this subsection can be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "let then @xmath33 be a vector from @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote a vector consisting of coordinates of @xmath33 put in decreasing order , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "we say that @xmath33 majorizes @xmath37 , which we write as @xmath38 , if the conditions @xmath39 hold for any @xmath40 and @xmath41 however , if in the last condition one replaces equality with inequality ` @xmath42 ' , then we say that @xmath33 _ weakly majorizes _ ( or _ submajorizes _ )",
    "@xmath37 , which we shall denote by @xmath43 .",
    "the notions of majorization and weak majorization are strictly connected to the notion of doubly stochastic and doubly substochastic matrices .",
    "let then @xmath18 denote some @xmath44 matrix .",
    "we say that @xmath45 is a _ doubly stochastic _",
    "( _ substochastic _ ) matrix if @xmath46 and the sum of all elements in any row and column equals one ( is less than or equal to one ) . using the above notions",
    ", we can reformulate the concept of majorization as follows ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ _ * fact 1 .",
    "* let @xmath47 . then @xmath38 ( @xmath43 )",
    "if and only if there exists such a doubly stochastic ( doubly substochastic ) matrix @xmath18 that @xmath48 _    another notion useful for further considerations and strictly connected with majorization is the schur  convex function .",
    "we say that a real  valued function @xmath49 ( @xmath50 denotes some open interval ) is _ schur  convex _ if the following implication holds : @xmath51 if the inequality in the above is reversed , we say that @xmath52 is _ schur ",
    "concave_. there is an easy  to  apply tool allowing us to decide if a given function @xmath52 is schur  convex ( concave ) .",
    "namely , @xmath49 is schur ",
    "convex if and only if it is symmetric and fullfils the following condition : @xmath53 for any @xmath54 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "once again , if the inequality in the above is reversed , the function @xmath52 is _ schur  concave_. ( notice that if @xmath52 is symmetric one does not have to check the above condition for all @xmath55 and @xmath56 . it suffices to check it for some pair @xmath54 . )",
    "the last definition we give in this subsection deals with the monotonicity of a multi",
    " variable function .",
    "we say that a @xmath57argument function @xmath52 is _ increasing ( decreasing ) _ if for @xmath47 and @xmath58 one has @xmath59",
    "( @xmath60 ) . here",
    "the ordering relation @xmath58 means that @xmath61 for any @xmath62 .",
    "if the above inequalities are strict we call a function _ strictly increasing ( decreasing)_.      finally , we introduce the concepts of positive and completely positive map and discuss some of their properties",
    ". let @xmath0 denote a linear map .",
    "we say that @xmath2 is _ positive _ if , acting on a positive element of @xmath63 , it returns a positive matrix .",
    "we say that @xmath2 is completely positive if the extended map @xmath64 is positive for any natural @xmath65 . here by @xmath66",
    "we denoted the identity map .",
    "a more detailed characterization of positive and completely positive maps can be found , e.g. in @xcite . as already stated , any positive but not completely positive map constitutes a necessary separability criterion for finite bipartite quantum systems .",
    "moreover , we say that a positive map @xmath2 is _ decomposable ( indecomposable ) _ if it can ( can not ) be written as a sum of a completely positive map and a completely positive map composed with transposition map . what is important here is that separability criteria based on decomposable positive maps can not detect ppt entangled states .",
    "only indecomposable maps have this advantage .",
    "on the other hand , any positive map on finite  dimensional matrix algebra can be written as the difference of two completely positive maps @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , i.e. @xmath69 then the necessary condition for separability of @xmath6 based on some particular positive map @xmath2 reads : @xmath70(\\varrho_{ab})\\geq [ i{\\otimes}\\lambda_{2}](\\varrho_{ab}).\\ ] ] finally , it should be also reminded that any completely positive map @xmath71 can be written as @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 are some linearly independent @xmath44 matrices .",
    "the parameter @xmath74 corresponding to the smallest number of operators @xmath73 in ( [ krauschoi ] ) is called a _ minimal length _ of @xmath2 @xcite . in this way any positive map on a finite matrix algebra is characterized by two numbers @xmath75 and @xmath76 corresponding to completely positive maps @xmath77 and @xmath78 in its decomposition .",
    "the decomposition corresponding to minimal @xmath79 will be called a minimal decomposition .",
    "as we shall see later , the efficiency of our inequalities in detecting entanglement strongly depends on the choice of @xmath77 and @xmath78 in equation ( [ relation5 ] ) .    for simplicity , in further considerations",
    ", we shall be denoting an extended map @xmath80 by @xmath81 @xmath82 and @xmath6 by @xmath83 whenever it does not lead to confusion .",
    "now we are ready to provide two constructions of entropic  like inequalities .",
    "the first method goes through the weak majorization relations generalizing the famous majorization criterion by nielsen and kempe @xcite , while the second one is direct in the sense that beginning with an operator inequality ( [ operatorin ] ) , we prove some functional inequality which in case of reduction map reproduces the standard entropic criterion . before that , in the following subsection , we will briefly recall some of the results of @xcite .      as mentioned previously the standard entropic inequalities ,",
    "though they possess a physical interpretation , are unable to detect ppt entangled states .",
    "this is because they follow from the reduction criterion @xcite , which is in general weaker than the criterion based on transposition .",
    "the question about the possibility of constructing some stronger inequalities resembling the entropic ones , using other positive maps ( also indecomposable ) , has been recently addressed in @xcite .",
    "firstly , in @xcite it was shown that using the breuer  hall map @xcite : @xmath84 where @xmath85 with @xmath86 denoting some antisymmetric matrix @xmath87 obeying @xmath88 , one can derive inequalities efficiently detecting ppt states . however , the inequalities work only when some commutation relations are satisfied by the investigated state . for instance , assuming that @xmath83 is separable and that the commutation relation @xmath89=0 $ ] holds , the following inequality was derived in @xcite : @xmath90 + \\tr\\left[\\varrho(\\varrho-\\tau_{b}^{u}(\\varrho))^{\\alpha-1}\\right]\\right\\}\\ ] ] with @xmath91 .",
    "assuming further that @xmath92=0 $ ] , we can obtain from the above @xmath93^{2k}\\right\\}.\\ ] ] in both inequalities @xmath94 and @xmath95 denotes the map @xmath96 applied to the second subsystem . comparing the above to the standard entropic inequalities ( [ entrwithout1 ] ) , it is clear that they are stronger , since on the right  hand hand side we have an additional nonnegative term .",
    "moreover , it was pointed out in @xcite that such inequalities can detect ppt entangled states in some physical systems .    in @xcite",
    ", the authors posed a question about some more general inequalities following from any positive map @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , the following inequalities : @xmath97(\\varrho)\\right)^{\\beta}\\geq \\tr\\varrho^{\\alpha}\\left([i{\\otimes}\\lambda_{2}](\\varrho)\\right)^{\\beta}\\qquad ( \\beta\\geq 0)\\ ] ] and @xmath98(\\varrho)\\right)^{\\beta}\\leq \\tr\\varrho^{\\alpha}\\left([i{\\otimes}\\lambda_{2}](\\varrho)\\right)^{\\beta } \\qquad ( \\beta\\in[-1,0)),\\ ] ] were derived , both for @xmath99 .",
    "it should also be explicitly stated than in the case of the second inequality ( [ th3 ] ) one has to remember that both operators @xmath100^{\\beta}$ ] have to be ` sandwiched ' with the projector onto the support of @xmath101(\\varrho)$ ] ( this can always be done during the derivation of this inequality , cf proof of theorem 2 ) to avoid the problems of inverse of matrices that are not of full rank .",
    "this means that on the right  hand side one can take the pseudoinverse of @xmath101(\\varrho)$ ] .",
    "unfortunately , to prove both inequalities ( [ th1 ] ) and ( [ th3 ] ) ( except for the case @xmath102 ) , one has to assume that @xmath103(\\varrho),\\varrho]=0 $ ] ; however , as discussed in @xcite , for many of the known positive ( even indecomposable ) maps , @xmath68 can be chosen to be an identity map .",
    "this means that in these cases the problem of commutativity vanishes . also , inequalities ( [ th1 ] ) can detect ppt entanglement if derived from indecomposable maps",
    "our main aim now is to discuss the possibility of deriving entropic inequalities which do not require any additional assumptions , and on the other hand , allow for efficient detection of ppt entangled states .",
    "we start by proving a simple fact relating the operator inequality @xmath104(\\varrho)\\geq [ i{\\otimes}\\lambda_{2}](\\varrho)$ ] and the concept of weak majorization . for this purpose",
    "let us prove a kind of generalization of results from @xcite .",
    "+ _ * theorem 1 . * if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are such positive operators that @xmath105 , then @xmath106 _    _ proof . _",
    "the proof simply follows the one given in @xcite .",
    "firstly , let us note that from the assumption it follows that @xmath107 ( equivalently @xmath108 ) acting on @xmath109 its kernel ( support ) is a subspace of @xmath109 spanned by the eigenvectors of @xmath4 corresponding to its zero ( nonzero ) eigenvalues .",
    "thus for any hermitian @xmath4 it holds that @xmath110 . ] to see it explicitly let @xmath111 and then due to the assumption we have @xmath112 meaning that if @xmath111 , then immediately @xmath113 .",
    "thus , @xmath5 acts on @xmath114 as a zero operator and therefore in what follows we can restrict our considerations to the support of @xmath4 .",
    "this in turn means that we can always assume @xmath4 to be invertible .",
    "assuming then that @xmath4 is invertible we can utilize the douglas lemma saying that if @xmath115 and @xmath116 then there exists such @xmath117 that @xmath118 ( by @xmath119 we denote the operator norm ) and @xmath120 now the proof is straightforward .",
    "let us assume that @xmath4 is diagonal in the standard basis and let @xmath86 be a unitary operator diagonalizing @xmath5 in the standard basis in @xmath121 , i.e. @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is a diagonal matrix containing nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath5 . then from equation ( [ relation1 ] ) we infer that @xmath124 where by @xmath125 we denoted @xmath126 .",
    "note that @xmath127 as @xmath128 . from equation ( [ relation2 ] ) we can easily find that @xmath129 which in turn allows us to write @xmath130 denoting by @xmath131 the elements of matrix @xmath18 , we can rewrite the above as the following matrix equation : @xmath132 .",
    "now it suffices to show that elements of @xmath18 obey the conditions for double substochasticity . for this purpose ,",
    "let us notice that since @xmath127 then also @xmath133 implying that @xmath134 and @xmath135 hold for any @xmath136 .",
    "this allows us to write @xmath137 in the same way we prove that @xmath138 concluding the proof @xmath139 .",
    "the above fact may be also proven in a more straightforward way .",
    "namely , it suffices to utilize the fact that if @xmath105 , then @xmath140 ( see e.g. @xcite ) from which the weak majorization follows .",
    "we decided , however , to keep an alternative proof as it relates directly the operator inequality @xmath105 and the submajorization relation .",
    "on the other hand this is yet another proof .    as a corollary of the above analysis we have the fact that if for some bipartite state @xmath83 ( possibly , but not necessarily separable ) it holds that @xmath141 ( recall that @xmath142 ) ,",
    "then @xmath143 i.e. eigenvalues of @xmath144 submajorize eigenvalues of @xmath145 .",
    "we can look at this result as a form of generalization of majorization relation to other positive maps than the reduction one .",
    "obviously , in the case of @xmath146 the above relation gives a rather weak criterion for separability as it reads @xmath147 .",
    "however , for states with maximally mixed subsystem @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath148 , the above criterion is equivalent to the nielsen ",
    "kempe majorization criterion @xmath149 ( the same holds for @xmath150 ) .",
    "this easily follows from the fact that in this case both criteria can be violated only by the largest eigenvalue of @xmath83 . on the other hand , even if in general weaker for the reduction map , the above criterion allows to employ other positive maps , even those detecting bound entanglement .",
    "what is then important , as we will see later , is that the criterion ( [ relation3 ] ) detects ppt entangled states when derived from indecomposable positive maps .",
    "moreover , it induces some scalar separability criteria detecting ppt entangled states and allowing for experimental realization .",
    "let us now apply the above submajorization relations to derive the aforementioned entropic inequalities .",
    "for this purpose , we can utilize the following known fact ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ _ * fact 2 .",
    "* let @xmath33 and @xmath37 be two vectors from @xmath34 . if @xmath151 then for any schur  convex",

    "concave decreasing functions the sign of inequality should be changed to `` @xmath154 '' . _",
    "+ note , however , that using the property that if @xmath105 then @xmath155 , one can derive a scalar inequality for any monotonic function , without the notion of schur convexity / concavity .",

    "this leads to conclusion that for these states the standard entropic inequality is always weaker than inequality ( [ aeq1 ] ) derived from reduction map .",
    "an example showing this dependence is presented in the next section .",
    "let us now state the equivalence between various criteria for states with maximally mixed subsystem .",
    "as already mentioned , @xmath326 ; thus the decomposition ( [ pmdecomp ] ) leads in this case to the following : @xmath327 note , that due to the above relation both maps , @xmath328 and @xmath329 , have the same eigenvectors . moreover , the projector corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath145 is the same as for the minimal eigenvalue of @xmath330 .",
    "thus , in this case , the positive map separability criterion is equivalent to the weak majorization criterion derived from decomposition ( [ pmdecmm ] ) .",
    "this , in turn , is equivalent to the inequality involving only maximal eigenvalues . precisely speaking we have the following : @xmath331 we will use the above statements to show how the new inequalities approximate a mean value of a linear entanglement witness in the case of states with at least one maximally mixed subsystem .",

    "consequently , for large @xmath324 the expression ( [ approx ] ) has the same sign as the mean value of a ` tailor  made ' entanglement witness ( [ witt ] ) , i.e. @xmath345 . as @xmath346 the inequality detects all states detected by the map itself . in this way , if one could normalize @xmath328 so that @xmath228 then the left hand side of inequality ( [ approx ] ) would approximate a mean value of a ` tailor  made ' linear entanglement witness ( [ witt ] ) .",
    "a similar approach was applied in @xcite , however the situation considered there was slightly different .",
    "namely the approximated average corresponded to hermitian operator @xmath347(p_{\\mathrm{max}})$ ] and @xmath348 was a projector corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath83 .",

    ", we utilized some class of functional inequalities .",
    "this is a continuation and extension of the results presented in @xcite where we have provided some inequalities stronger than the standard entropic inequalities and allowing for the detection of bound entanglement .",
    "moreover , it is pointed out that both the weak majorization criterion , and the inequalities derived from decomposition ( [ pmdecomp ] ) of some map @xmath2 lead , for states with at least one maximally mixed subsystem , to the criterion equivalent to the necessary criterion @xmath3(\\varrho)\\geq 0 $ ] .",
    "the derived generalizations of entropic inequalities were analyzed in the context of the protocol of state merging and approximation of a mean value of a linear entanglement witness .",
