    "processes and structures involving electrostatic interactions are abundant in soft matter and play an important role in colloidal , polymeric , and biological systems@xcite .",
    "this is because charges tend to make objects soluble in water .",
    "even the ubiquitous van - der - waals or dispersion interactions are in fact due to locally fluctuating electric fields ( or , equivalently , spontaneous polarization charges)@xcite .",
    "soft materials are easily deformed or rearranged by potentials comparable to thermal energy ; examples include polymers , self - assembled membranes or micelles and complexes formed by the binding of oppositely charged macromolecular components .",
    "it becomes clear that interactions caused and mediated by permanent and induced charges constitute prominent factors determining the behavior and properties of soft matter at the mesoscopic scale , since they are strong enough to control and modify soft matter structures .",
    "we list three examples to demonstrate the diversity of phenomena we have in mind :    * colloids and smaller than a few microns and thus encompasses proteins , polymers , clusters , micelles , viruses and so on . ] that are dispersed in aqueous solvents experience mutual attractions due to van - der - waals forces@xcite and additional solvent - structure - induced forces@xcite .",
    "they thus tend to aggregate and form large agglomerates@xcite .",
    "large aggregates typically sediment , thereby destroying the dispersion . in colloidal science , this process is called coagulation or flocculation , depending on the strength and range of the inter - colloidal forces involved . in many industrial applications ( for example dispersion paints , food emulsions such as mayonnaise or milk ) , stability of a dispersion",
    "is a desirable property , in other applications ( such as sewage or waste - water treatment ) it is not@xcite .",
    "one way to stabilize a colloidal dispersion against coagulation is to impart permanent charges to the colloids : similarly charged particles typically repel each other such that van - der - waals attraction ( which is always stronger than electrostatic repulsion at small distances ) can not induce aggregation@xcite .",
    "every rule has an exception , and in this particular case it is an interesting exception : it has been found over the years that strongly charged colloids in certain cases attract strongly , which caused considerable confusion at first and is now quite well understood due to intense research over the last years ( more of this in section 3)@xcite .",
    "a second method of stabilizing a colloidal dispersion is to graft polymers to the surface of the colloids .",
    "if the polymers are under good - solvent conditions , they will swell and inhibit close contacts between two colloids .",
    "for this task , charged polymers are ideal , since they swell a lot in water@xcite .",
    "many structures obtained with charged colloids bear resemblance with atomic structures , but occur on length and time scales that are much easier to observe experimentally . to some extent",
    ", colloidal systems have been used as models for ordering phenomena on the atomistic scale . *",
    "polymer science and technology have revolutionized the design , fabrication , and processing of modern materials and form an integral part of every - day life@xcite .",
    "classical polymer synthesis is based on hydro - carbon chemistry and thus leads to polymers which are typically insoluble in water . in the quest for cheap , environmentally friendly , and non - toxic materials ,",
    "attention has shifted to charged polymers , so - called _ polyelectrolytes _ , since they are typically water - soluble@xcite .",
    "the mechanism behind this water - solubility is connected with the translational entropy of mobile ions that are trapped in the polyelelctrolyte solution@xcite .",
    "for some polyelectrolytes , the resulting affinity for water is so high that they are righteously called _ super - adsorbing polymers _ : they can bind amounts of water in multiple excess of their own weight@xcite .",
    "this property is put to good use in many practical applications such as diapers . * human dna , the storage medium of all genetic information , is a semiflexible biopolymer with a total length of roughly @xmath0 , bearing a total negative charge of about @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 denotes an elementary charge ) , which is contained inside the cell nucleus with a diameter of less than @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to the task of confining such a large , strongly charged object in a very small compartment , the dna is incessantly replicated , repaired , and transcribed , which seems to pose an unsurmountable dna - packaging problem .",
    "nature has solved this by an ingenious multi - hierarchical structure . on the lowest level",
    ", a short section of the dna molecule , consisting of 146 base pairs ( corresponding to a length of roughly @xmath4 ) is wrapped twice around a positively charged protein ( the so - called histone ) . by this , the dna is both compactified and partially neutralized . in experiments@xcite , it has been shown that a tightly wrapped state is only stable for intermediate , physiological salt concentrations .",
    "since salt modulates the electrostatic interactions , it is suggested that electrostatics are responsible for this interesting behavior .",
    "indeed , as is explained in section 6 , only at intermediate salt concentration is an optimal balance between electrostatic dna  dna repulsion ( favoring a straight dna conformation ) and the dna  histone attraction achieved .",
    "similar complexes between charged spherical objects and oppositely charged polymers are also studied experimentally in the context of micelle - polymer@xcite and colloid - polymer@xcite interactions .    in these examples ,",
    "electrostatic interactions dominate , they are responsible for the salient features and the characteristic properties and therefore have to be included in any theoretical description . this is the type of system we aim at in this review , and this is also the operational definition of a strongly charged system : a system where it makes sense to neglect other interactions than coulombic in a first approximation ( a more quantitative definition will be introduced in section 3 ) .",
    "of course , the boundary to materials where other interactions come into play as well is diffuse : water structures at neutral and charged interfaces exhibit surprising properties and can often not be neglected , as is discussed in section 10 . likewise , almost all phenomena involving charges in aqueous solution show a characteristic ion - specificity@xcite , namely a poorly understood dependence on the specific ion type present in the bulk , which is somehow related to the quantum - chemical properties of solvated ions ( see section11 ) .",
    "our viewpoint is that it makes sense to use the whole scenario of simplified models theoretical physicists love and are used to , namely to treat charged macroions as smooth , featureless and homogeneously charged bodies , ions as point - like or ( on a higher level ) as charged spheres , and to replace water by a continuum medium .",
    "this was very successful in the past ( as is reviewed in sections 3 and 5 - 8 ) and there are many lessons still to be learned on this level .",
    "at the same time , many of the presently pressing experimental questions can only be answered if one leaves this level and treats water as a discrete solvent with the capability to rearrange at surfaces and close to charged particles and ions as complex objects that form weak bonds with other charges or water molecules .",
    "it is as yet not clear whether fundamental insight can be gained on this more microscopic level or whether one will be lost in the realm of particularities ( sections 10 and 11 give testimony of the problems one encounters when dealing with charges in the microscopic world ) .",
    "the hope would be that a coarse - grained formulation in terms of effective parameters will still be possible which would nevertheless encompass ion - specific and solvation effects .",
    "almost any material acquires a surface charge when dipped into water . *",
    "_ permanent _ * charges on single molecules , surfaces , or interfaces in aqueous media arise via two routes : firstly , the substance can contain dissociable surface groups , which under suitable ph conditions may donate protons ( in which case one speaks of _ acidic _ groups ) , thereby imparting negative charges to the surface , or accept protons ( these are called _ basic _ groups ) and thus produce positive charges on the surface ( the ph is a logarithmic measure of the bulk proton concentration , as will be discussed at length in section 9 ) .",
    "what is the mechanism for this dissociation ?",
    "why should molecules fall apart spontaneously to produce charged parts and why do these oppositely charged pieces not bind together again ? as an example , consider the ionisation of hydrogen , which requires the energy of @xmath5 or ( in units of the thermal energy at room temperatures ) @xmath6 .",
    "clearly , this ionization process can not be thermally activated at room temperatures .",
    "the situation is very different for chemical groups which have acidic character : here the energy needed to remove a proton from the molecule in an aqueous environment is much smaller ; to give a few examples , it is roughly @xmath7 for the carboxyl group in the reaction @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the sulfonic group in the reaction @xmath10 the sulfonic group is therefore said to be a stronger acid than the carboxylic group .",
    "the dielectric properties of the surrounding water are very important in these reactions , as without water ( i.e. in the gas phase ) these reactions cost much more energy ( see section 11 ) .",
    "still , energy has to be paid in order to crack the acids , but again water properties come in : since the concentration of water molecules in the condensed liquid state ( about @xmath11 ) is much higher than of the other components , according to the law of mass action the equilibrium is shifted to the right side and charged groups do indeed occur frequently .",
    "the equilibrium between association and dissociation can be fine - tuned by temperature and the concentration of @xmath12 ions in the solution ( i.e. @xmath13 ) .",
    "the second mechanism for the permanent charging of surfaces involves small charged molecules , such as salt ions , which physically or chemically adsorb to a surface , thereby leading to an effective surface charge . in practice",
    ", one typically encounters a mixture of these two mechanisms , such that the effective charge of a surface is controlled by the distribution of acidic and basic surface groups , solution ph , and bulk concentration of charged solutes .",
    "_ induced _ charges arise via the polarization of atoms , molecules , and macroscopic bodies@xcite . for molecules that possess a permanent dipole moment ( such as water ) , the macroscopic polarization contains a large contribution from the orientation of such molecular dipole moments .",
    "the interaction between spontaneous polarization charges gives rise to van - der - waals forces , which act between all bodies and particles , regardless of whether they are charged , contain permanent dipole moments or not@xcite .",
    "the reduced electrostatic interaction between two spherically symmetric charges in vacuum ( throughout this review , all energies are given in units of the thermal energy @xmath14 ) can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the coulomb interaction between two elementary charges , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the reduced charges in units of the elementary charge @xmath2 , and @xmath19 is the vacuum dielectric constant appears in the coulomb law but not in the poisson equation . ] .",
    "the interaction only depends on the distance @xmath20 between the charges .",
    "electrostatic interactions are additive , therefore the total electrostatic energy of a given distribution of charges results from adding up all pairwise interactions between charges according to eq.([intro1 ] ) . _ in principle _ , the equilibrium behavior of an ensemble of charged particles ( e.g. a salt solution ) follows from the partition function , i.e. , the weighted sum over all different microscopic configurations , which via the boltzmann factor depends on the electrostatic energy of each configuration . _ in practice _ , however , this route is complicated for several reasons :    \\i ) the coulomb interaction , eq.([intro1 ] ) , is very long - ranged , such that ( even , and as turns out , especially for low densities ) many particles are coupled due to their simultaneous electrostatic interactions ) reaches unity at a distance of roughly @xmath21 , which in the nanoscopic world is considered large . ] .",
    "electrostatic problems are therefore typically _ many - body problems_. as is well known , even the problem of only three bodies interacting via gravitational potentials ( which are analogous to eq.([intro1 ] ) except that they are always attractive ) defies closed - form solutions . to make the problem even worse ,",
    "even if we consider only two charged particles , the problem effectively becomes a many - body problem , for the following two reasons :    \\ii ) in almost all cases , charged objects are dissolved in water . as all molecules and atoms , water is polarizable and thus reacts to the presence of a charge with polarization charges .",
    "in addition , and this is a by far more important effect , water molecules carry a permanent dipole moment , and are thus partially oriented in the vicinity of charged objects . the polarization effect of the solvent can to a good approximation and non - linear correction terms .",
    "they are important for the solvation of ions .",
    "] be taken into account by introducing a relative dielectric constant @xmath22@xcite .",
    "note that for water , @xmath23 , so that electrostatic interactions are much weaker in water than in air ( or some other low - dielectric solvent ) .",
    "the coulomb potential now reads @xmath24 and the bjerrum length @xmath25 , which is a measure of the distance where the interaction is of thermal strength , has the value @xmath26 .",
    "\\iii ) in all biological and most industrial applications , water contains mobile salt ions .",
    "salt ions of opposite charge are drawn to charged objects and form loosely bound counter - ion clouds and thus effectively reduce their charges ; this process is called _",
    "screening_. the effect of charge screening is dramatically different from the presence of a polarizable environment .",
    "as has been shown by debye and hckel some 80 years ago@xcite , screening modifies the electrostatic interaction such that it falls off exponentially with distance .",
    "the following points are important for the discussion in the subsequent sections : for each surface charge an oppositely charged counterion is released into the aqueous solution .",
    "these counterions form clouds that are loosely bound to the surface charges .",
    "the interactions between charged bodies and their electric properties itself ( such as their electrophoretic mobilities in an electric driving field ) are predominantly determined by the properties of these counterion clouds , and an understanding of the properties of charged bodies requires an understanding of the counterion clouds first .",
    "highly and opppositely charged surfaces or particles with permanent charges typically have interaction potentials that are much stronger than thermal energy , one often obtains quasi - bound complexes which have to be dealt with in a very different way than the rather diffuse and highly fluctuating counterion distributions . typically , charged soft matter ( e.g. polymers , fluid membranes ) is deformable and shows thermally excited shape fluctuations , and one is dealing with the intricate interplay of shape and counterion fluctuations .",
    "electric fields are used in electrophoresis experiments to analyze and purify charged soft matter .",
    "the electric field sets charged ions and particles in motion and thus leads to dissipation of energy , one is facing a non - equilibrium situation .",
    "it also changes the equilibrium distribution functions , and can lead to non - equilibrium phase transitions , as will be shown towards the end of this review",
    ". finally , oppositely charged chemical groups are often in intimate contact to each other , for example in situations when oppositely charged bodies are bound to each other .",
    "the boundary between chemical binding and salt bridging is diffuse , and quantum - mechanical effects which are caused by the overlap of electron orbitals give sizeable and very specific contributions to the effective interaction between charged groups . for a detailed understanding of the statistics and dynamics of charged soft matter",
    ", those quantum - mechanical effects in principle have to be taken into account .",
    "experimentally , the interaction between charged planar objects can be very elegantly studied using a stack of charged , self - assembled membranes@xcite-@xcite .",
    "such membranes spontaneously form in aqueous solution of charged amphiphilic molecules ( lipids or surfactants ) and consist of bilayers which are separated by water slabs of thickness @xmath27 ( it is the same structure that forms an integral part of biological cell walls)@xcite .",
    "since the membranes are highly charged ( they typically contain one surface charge per @xmath28 and thus belong to the most highly charged surfaces known ) , one would expect strong repulsion between them , or , which is equivalent , a strongly positive and monotonically decaying osmotic pressure in such a stack .",
    "in contrast , experiments using the cationic surfactant ddab show that a mysterious attraction exists between the charged lamellae@xcite .",
    "this is seen in fig.1a , where an electron - micrograph of a sample containing 50 % water and 50 % ddab , rapidly frozen from the equilibrated structure at room temperature ( and thus representative of the room - temperature situation ) is shown .",
    "one can discern a two - phase coexistence between two macroscopic lamellar phases with different water - layer thicknesses @xmath27 . in the corresponding pressure / surfactant concentration isotherm ( obtained at room temperature ) in fig.1b",
    "the osmotic pressure shows a pronounced plateau as a function of the water - layer thickness , equivalent to macroscopic coexistence of two lamellar phases with different water content .",
    "such phase coexistences are best known from non - ideal gases and result from an attraction between the gas molecules ( compare the van - der - waals equation of state ) . in the present case , it means that an attractive force acts between the highly charged membranes , strong enough to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the charges on the membrane ( note that the dispersion attraction is too weak by orders of magnitude to account for this attraction ) .",
    "this is quite surprising , and can not be explained within classical theories ( based on a mean - field description for the counterion distribution ) .",
    "clearly , the real membrane system is quite complex and contains a number of effects that we will not consider ( such as shape fluctuations , chemical structure of the surfactant heads , etc . ) .",
    "but we will demonstrate in the following that a simple argument for the counterion induced interaction between charged surfaces suffices to explain the observed miscibility gap in an almost quantitative fashion .",
    "this will lead us to a theoretical description of strongly coupled charged systems which complements the classical mean - field theory . in all the above - cited experiments on charged lamellar phases monovalent counterions were employed .",
    "we should add that a similar attraction is also seen with less strongly charged bilayer systems when the mono - valent counterions are replaced by divalent counterions@xcite .",
    "the experimentally observed attraction between similarly charged surfaces requires a deeper understanding of counterion layers at highly charged surfaces , we therefore start our discussion with a single , planar charged plate with counterions only ( i.e. no additional salt ions ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for a system of @xmath29 counterions of valence @xmath30 , located at positions @xmath31 , close to a single oppositely charged planar wall of charge density @xmath32 is ( in units of @xmath33 ) given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the bjerrum length ( @xmath2 is the elementary charge , @xmath22 is the relative dielectric constant ) . in water ,",
    "one typically has @xmath26 . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", the dielectric constant is assumed to be homogeneous throughout the system , the plate is smooth , impenetrable to ions and homogeneously charged , and the counterions are assumed to be point - like . still , the system is nontrivial and allows to understand the special features of strongly charged systems in a very lucid manner . the first term in eq.([hone ] )",
    "contains the coulombic repulsion between all ions , the second term accounts for the electrostatic attraction to the wall ( which is assumed to be of infinite lateral extent and located in the @xmath36 plane ) .",
    "the relevant length scale in the system is the gouy - chapman length , @xmath37 , which is defined as the distance from the charged wall at which the potential energy of one isolated counterion equals the thermal energy @xmath14 . as will turn out later , it is a measure of the typical height of the counterion layer . from equation ( [ hone ] )",
    "it can be read of to be @xmath38 if one expresses all lengths in units of the gouy - chapman length and rescales them according to @xmath39 the hamiltonian equation ( [ hone ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath40 now the hamiltonian only depends on a single parameter , the coupling parameter @xmath41 which includes the effects of varying temperature @xmath42 ( via the bjerrum length @xmath43 ) , surface charge density @xmath32 , and counterion valence @xmath30 .",
    "the counterion valence enters the coupling parameter as a cube , showing that this is an experimental parameter which decisively controls the resultant behavior of the double layer ( compare the experiments with charged lamellar systems where the counterion valency has been increased@xcite ) .",
    "small values of @xmath44 define the weak - coupling regime ( where , as we will demonstrate later on , the mean - field poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory becomes valid ) , large values define the strong - coupling ( sc ) regime , where surface - adsorbed ions are strongly correlated@xcite .",
    "this strong - coupling regime constitutes a sound physical limit with behavior very different from the pb limit , as can be shown rigorously using field - theoretic methods@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the mean lateral area per counter - ion is determined by the surface charge density and defines a length scale ( which we associate with the lateral distance between ions ) , @xmath45 , via the relation @xmath46 in rescaled units , this lateral distance reads @xmath47 since the height of the bound counterion cloud is unity in reduced units , it follows from equation ( [ aperp ] ) that for coupling parameters larger than unity , @xmath48 , the lateral distance between ions is larger than their separation from the wall and thus the layer is essentially flat and two - dimensional , as is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ schema1]a@xcite .",
    "for @xmath49 , on the other hand , the lateral ion separation @xmath45 is smaller than the layer height @xmath37 , which means that within the counter - ion layer the ion - ion correlations should be rather 3d fluid - like , as depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ schema1]b .",
    "the two different limits are visualized in figure [ fig2 ] , where we show snapshots of counterion distributions obtained in monte - carlo simulations for two different values of the coupling parameter , @xmath50 . for small @xmath44 ,",
    "the ion distribution is indeed rather diffuse and disordered and mean - field theory should work , since each ion moves in a weakly varying potential due to the diffuse cloud of neighboring ions . for large @xmath44 , on the other hand , ion - ion distances are large compared to the distance from the wall ; the ions form a flat layer on the charged wall . for large @xmath44 ,",
    "the repulsion between condensed ions at a typical distance @xmath45 , proportional to @xmath51 , is large compared with thermal energy , as can be seen from the fact that @xmath52 the layer is thus flat and also strongly coupled@xcite , in the three - dimensional diffuse counterion cloud , depicted schematically in fig.[schema1]b , the typical inter - ionic distance is @xmath53 and the interaction at such distance scales as @xmath54@xcite . in this case",
    "the counterion cloud is weakly coupled and thus only weakly correlated . ] . as will be shown in section 3.5 , the counterion layer forms a crystal around @xmath55@xcite , meaning that there is a wide range of coupling parameters , @xmath56 , where the counterion layer is highly correlated but still liquid",
    ". nevertheless , mean - field theory , which can pictorially be viewed as an approximation where one laterally smears out the counterion charge distribution , is expected to break down , at least for the system with @xmath57 ; this is so because each ion moves , though confined by its immediate neighbors in the lateral directions , almost independently from the other ions along the vertical direction ( which constitutes the soft mode ) .",
    "we stress that this continuous crossover from a three - dimensional , disordered counterion distribution for small @xmath44 , to a two - dimensional correlated counterion distribution for large values @xmath44 ( which will be discussed in more detail later on ) is a pure consequence of scaling analysis ; as the only input , it requires the rescaled counterion layer height to be of order unity , which is true irrespective of the precise value of @xmath44 as will be demonstrated next .    using monte - carlo simulation techniques ,",
    "we have obtained counterion density profiles by averaging over statistically sampled counterion configurations for different values of @xmath44 .",
    "since the surface charge density is homogeneous , the counterion density profile @xmath58 only depends on the distance from the wall , @xmath59 .",
    "the counterions exactly neutralize the surface charges , the integral over the counterion density profile is therefore given by ( in unrescaled units ) @xmath60 . using the rescaled distance",
    "coordinate @xmath61 , the integral gives @xmath62 , which suggests to define the rescaled density profile as @xmath63 which , via the condition of electroneutrality , is normalized to unity , @xmath64 in figure [ fig2]b we show rescaled counterion density profiles obtained using monte carlo simulations for various values of the coupling parameter @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "one notes that all profiles saturate at a rescaled density of unity at the charged wall .",
    "this is in accord with the contact - value theorem , which states that the counterion density at the wall is for the case of a single homogeneously charged wall exactly given by @xmath69 , or , in rescaled units , @xmath70 ( incidentally in agreement with the poisson - boltzmann prediction)@xcite .",
    "the contact value theorem eq.([condit2 ] ) follows from the requirement of vanishing net force acting on the wall , which means that the osmotic pressure , in units of @xmath33 given by the counterion density at the wall , @xmath71 , has to cancel the electrostatic attractive force between wall and counterion layer , which is given by @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath73 , from which eq .",
    "( [ condit2 ] ) directly follows .",
    "given the two constraints on the rescaled density profile , namely being normalized to unity and reaching a contact density of unity at the wall , equations ( [ condit1 ] ) and ( [ condit2 ] ) , it is clear that the profiles in the units chosen by us have to be quite similar to each other even for vastly different coupling parameters , as indeed observed in figure [ fig2]b .",
    "also , it is a rather trivial consequence of both constraints that the typical decay length of the profiles is always given by unity in rescaled units ( though , strictly speaking , the first moment @xmath74 of the density distribution diverges logarithmically within pb theory ) .",
    "still , the asymptotic predictions for vanishing coupling constant ( @xmath75 , pb theory , solid line in figure [ fig2]b ) and diverging coupling constant ( @xmath76 , sc theory , broken line ) are as different as they can be from a functional point of view , while still obeying the constraints mentioned above , as we will now recapitulate .    at low coupling , the counterion density distribution is well described by the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory , which predicts an algebraically decaying profile@xcite @xmath77 while in the opposite limit of high coupling the strong coupling ( sc ) theory , predicting an exponentially decaying profile@xcite @xmath78 becomes asymptotically exact . an exponential density profile ( although with a different pre - factor ) has also been obtained by shklovskii@xcite using a heuristic model for a highly charged surface , where counterions bound to the wall are in chemical equilibrium with free counterions .",
    "the intuitive explanation for the exponential density profile equation ( [ scone ] ) uses the fact that for large values of the coupling constant , the lateral distance between counterions is large and therefore a counterion mostly interacts with the charged plate and experiences the bare linear wall potential , the second term in equation ( [ h - one - mu ] ) , with only small corrections due to other ions .",
    "the single - ion distribution function follows by exponentiating the linear wall potential , similar to the derivation of the barometric height formula for the atmospheric density , and in agreement with the result in equation ( [ scone ] ) .",
    "it is important to note , though , that equation ( [ scone ] ) has been obtained as the leading term in a systematic field - theoretic derivation which also gives correction terms@xcite which in turn have been favorably compared with simulation results@xcite .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig2]b , the pb density profile equation ( [ pbone ] ) is only realized for @xmath49 , while the strong - coupling profile equation ( [ scone ] ) is indeed the asymptotic solution and agrees with simulation results for @xmath79 over the distance range considered in the simulations .",
    "in fact , there is a crossover between the two asymptotic theories which is distance dependent@xcite , as we will briefly discuss now .    in the strong coupling limit",
    "@xmath48 an expansion of all observables in inverse powers of @xmath44 can be set up that has much in common with a virial expansion@xcite .",
    "the density distribution can thus be written as @xmath80 with the leading correction to the asymptotic strong - coupling profile given by@xcite @xmath81 a systematic estimate of the limits of accuracy of the asymptotic sc theory is furnished by comparing the leading and next - leading contributions , eqs.([scone ] ) and ( [ strong7 ] ) , which enter the systematic sc - expansion of the counter - ion density eq.([expand2 ] ) .",
    "this limit of applicability turns out to be distance - dependent . for large separations @xmath82",
    "the sc theory should be valid for @xmath83 using the relation between the lateral distance between counter - ions , @xmath84 , and the coupling parameter , eq.([aperp ] ) , the latter threshold can be transformed into @xmath85 or @xmath86 .",
    "this means that the sc approach should be valid as long as one considers distances from the wall , @xmath59 , smaller than the average lateral distance between counter - ions , @xmath45 .",
    "this is in accord with the intuitive expectation since the bare wall potential prevails for these distances .    in the small - coupling regime , @xmath87",
    ", a similar expansion can be performed using the field - theoretic tool of a loop - expansion@xcite .",
    "we obtain for the density profile the expansion in powers of the coupling parameter @xmath88 this shows directly that the saddle - point ( or mean - field ) method , which yields the first ( leading ) term , is good when the coupling parameter @xmath44 is small . for large values of @xmath44 ,",
    "higher - order terms become important . for large separations from the wall ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior has been determined explicitly as@xcite @xmath89 the correction in eq.([hasym2 ] ) decays faster than the leading term in eq.([pbone ] ) . by comparing the two expressions",
    ", one obtains that for large separations from the plate , @xmath82 , the pb prediction for the density , eq.([pbone ] ) , should be valid for coupling parameters @xmath90 this shows that it does not make sense to talk about the accuracy of the pb or sc approach per se for a given coupling parameter @xmath44 .",
    "rather , from eq.([pbvalid2 ] ) it is seen that the pb solution becomes more accurate as one moves further away from the plate .",
    "conversely , from eq.([scvalid2 ] ) the sc solution becomes more accurate as one moves closer to the plate . by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ scvalid2 ] ) and ( [ pbvalid2 ] ) one realizes that for large distances from the wall ( or for large coupling strengths ) , a gap appears over the distance range @xmath91 where neither of the asymptotic theories is applicable .",
    "this gap widens as the coupling strength increases and can be interpreted as a distance range where the density distribution is neither described by the sc result @xmath92 , see eq.([scone ] ) , nor the pb result , eq.([pbone ] ) , which for large separations reads @xmath93 . that an intermediate scaling range has to exist already follows from the fact that the asymptotic density profiles cross only once at a rescaled distance from the plate of the order of unity . in order to connect the sc and pb profiles continuously at much larger distances",
    ", one needs an intermediate distance range where the density decays slower than the inverse square with distance .",
    "some ideas on how to understand and analytically describe this intermediate regime have been brought forward in refs.@xcite in a number of recently published papers counterion density profiles were calculated for intermediate coupling parameter using various approximate theories and successfully compared with numerical data@xcite .    in summary , the strong - coupling theory is a theory that becomes asymptotically exact in the opposite limit when the mean - field or poisson - boltzmann theory is valid .",
    "the two theories therefore describe the two extreme situations , as can be seen most clearly in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "experimentally , a coupling parameter @xmath94 , which is already quite close to the strong - coupling limit , is reached with divalent ions for a surface charged density @xmath95 , which is feasible with compressed charged monolayers , and with trivalent counter ions for @xmath96 , which is a typical value .",

    "a huge body of experimental evidence@xcite-@xcite suggests that the complex is only stable for intermediate salt concentrations between @xmath345 and @xmath346 ( the so - called physiological salt concentration in the body is roughly @xmath347 which corresponds to the salt concentration in the sea ) . for salt concentrations outside this finite range",
    "the complex falls apart .",
    "as was explained in detail in section 3.3 , salt modulates the electrostatic interactions ; it follows that an electrostatic mechanism is the cause for this interesting behavior .    designing a simple model that can explain the salt and charge dependent behavior of the nucleosomal core particle requires a number of approximations concerning the structure of the dna , the histone octamer and their interactions .",
    "our strategy was to formulate the simplest possible model which captures the characteristic features responsible for the salt - dependent nucleosomal core structures@xcite . in the following we report calculations of the ground state of a single semiflexible polyelectrolyte of finite length which is in contact with a single oppositely charged sphere in the presence of salt .",
    "extensive literature exists on similar model calculations for stiff chains@xcite , flexible chains@xcite , for multiple spheres compexing with one polymer@xcite , for interacting complexes@xcite and on simulation studies for complex formation@xcite .",
    "polymer form fluctuations away from the ground state will be considered at the end of this section , where it will be shown that the ground state approximation for rather stiff or highly charged polymers is justified .",
    "we specifically consider parameters appropriate for the dna - histone system , approximating the histone as a uniformly charged , impenetrable and solid sphere and the dna as a uniformly charged semiflexible polymer of length @xmath348@xcite .",
    "we deal with the so - called nucleosomal core particles consisting of dna with 146 base pairs ( bp ) of length @xmath349 each , leading to a total dna length of @xmath350 .",
    "the stiffness of the dna contains charge independent and charge dependent contributions .",
    "the former are due to the energy associated with the deformation of hydrogen bonds which stabilize the double helical geometry of dna and are incorporated by using a semiflexible polymer model with a mechanical bending stiffness . the latter stem from the fact that the negatively charged monomers of the dna tend to maximize their mutual distance and",
    "thus prefer an extended configuration .",
    "this electrostatic contribution decreases with increasing salt concentration of the solution and vanishes at the hypothetical limit of infinite salt concentration@xcite .",
    "the salt independent mechanical persistence length of dna is therefore the infinite salt limit of the total persistence length , which has experimentally been determined as @xmath351  @xcite .",
    "a discussion of different methods to determine the persistence length of dna is found in  @xcite . the electrostatic contribution to the persistence length we take into account by explicitly including the electrostatic self energy of dna conformations ,",
    "we therefore accurately include the scale - dependence of the electrostatic contribution to the persistence length@xcite which is particularly important in our case since the scale of bending ( the histone diameter ) becomes of the order or even smaller than the screening length .",
    "the histone octamer is approximated as a rigid sphere of radius @xmath352 .",
    "this is of course only a very rough approximation of the real structure , which is not a perfect sphere and also possesses a corrugated surface with specific binding sites for the dna .",
    "also , any conformational changes of the histone octamer , which do occur for extremely low or high salt concentration , are neglected .",
    "the dna is modeled as a polymer with radius of @xmath353 . in the actual calculation we fix the minimal distance between the sphere center and the dna monomer centers to be @xmath354 , which is the sum of histone and dna radii .",
    "the electrostatic interactions between charges on the dna with each other and the sphere are described by debye - hckel ( dh ) potentials that neglect non - linear effects ( such as counterion condensation or counterion release , for which one would need to use the full non - linear poisson - boltzmann theory@xcite ) .",
    "the main reason for this approximation is that the calculation of the optimal dna configuration within the pb approach is at present numerically not feasible . for large salt concentrations ,",
    "the dh approximation becomes valid , as has been shown by calculating the electrostatic contribution to the bending rigidity of a charged cylinder@xcite .",
    "the energy functional for a given dna configuration of contour length @xmath348 , parameterized by the space curve @xmath355 and in units of @xmath33 , reads @xmath356 where we implicitly assume that the dna molecule is inextensible , i.e. , @xmath357 .",
    "the first term describes the mechanical bending energy , proportional to the bare persistence length @xmath358 , where the curvature @xmath359 is given by the second derivative of @xmath355 with respect to the internal coordinate s. the second term describes the electrostatic attraction between the sphere and the dna@xcite .",
    "the charge of the sphere in units of the elementary charge e is denoted by @xmath331 and the linear charge density of the dna ( in units of e ) is denoted by @xmath259 .",
    "a key ingredient of the debye - hckel - theory is the screening of electrostatic interactions , which is quantified by the debye - hckel screening length @xmath103 .",
    "it measures the distance beyond which the interaction between two charges is exponentially damped . for monovalent salt",
    "one finds @xmath360 , where @xmath100 is the salt concentration . at 0.1 molar concentration in water , i.e. at physiological conditions",
    ", one has @xmath361 .",
    "the third term describes the electrostatic repulsion between charges on the dna .",
    "we therefore have two terms that tend to straighten the dna , namely the mechanic bending energy and the electrostatic repulsion between dna monomers .",
    "the former is salt independent , whereas the latter looses importance with increasing salt concentration .",
    "these repulsions are balanced by the sphere - dna electrostatic attraction , which favors bending of the dna in order to wrap it around the sphere , but also becomes weaker for increasing salt concentration .",
    "it transpires that salt will determine the dna structure in a rather subtle way , as will be demonstrated by our numerical results .    in analyzing the model defined by eq.([freeenergy ] ) we take advantage of the short length of the dna strand , @xmath362 , compared to the effective persistence length , which is at least of the order of the bare persistence length , @xmath363 . as a starting point",
    ", we therefore neglect fluctuations and undulation forces  @xcite between dna and sphere and apply a ground state analysis to the model .",
    "this consists of finding the configuration of the dna that minimizes eq .",
    "( [ freeenergy ] ) with the constraints @xmath364 ( no stretching ) and @xmath365 ( impenetrability of sphere ) .",
    "we also use debye - hckel - potentials with the full dna line charge @xmath366 , corresponding to the maximal degree of dissociation of dna ( and neglecting counterion - condensation effects@xcite which have been investigated in @xcite ) .    in fig .",

    "as the salt concentration is increased from @xmath370 to @xmath371 , the deflection of the dna arms increases continuously .",

    "one of the dna arms is totally wrapped around the sphere . as @xmath373 is increased further , the extended arm is more and more pulled onto the sphere until at @xmath374 the dna is fully adsorbed onto the sphere and the two - fold rotational symmetry is restored . at @xmath375",
    "a strongly discontinuous transition occurs in which the dna completely dewraps from the sphere .",
    "the dewrapped state at high salt concentration is markedly different from the state at zero salt .",
    "there is only one short region of nonzero bending of the dna connecting two basically straight arms .",
    "this sequence of complexation structures demonstrates one of our main results , namely that the wrapped dna conformation is only stable for intermediate salt concentrations , explaining a large set of experimental results for nucleosomal core particles@xcite .",
    "we summarize our results for a dna length of @xmath376 in the phase diagram presented in fig.[fig10]b . in the absence of salt , @xmath377 ,",
    "the wrapping transition occurs at @xmath378 ( in agreement with previous theoretical predictions@xcite ) . in agreement with experiments",
    "@xcite , complexation is most pronounced at intermediate salt concentrations . for low salt concentration ,",
    "the strong dna - dna repulsion prevents complexation , for high salt screening weakens the dna - sphere attraction sufficiently so that the mechanical bending resistance induces dewrapping . the minimal sphere charge to wrap the dna , @xmath379 , is obtained for @xmath380 ( @xmath381 for monovalent salt ) , corresponding to physiological conditions . since the total charge on the dna is about @xmath382 , the complex",
    "is strongly overcharged for all @xmath383 , i.e. , in the whole wrapped region shown in the phase diagram .",

    "these results highlight a peculiarity of electrostatic complexation phenomena , and is mirrored by an at first sight perplexing approximation used in our model calculation : we do use the debye - hckel approximation for the interaction between charges on the sphere and on the dna , which amounts to taking into account positional fluctuations of the salt ions within a gaussian approximation@xcite .",
    "however , we do not take into account positional fluctuations of the dna itself , but concentrate on the ground state instead .",
    "the reason for the different treatment of salt ions and dna monomers is that the total amount of charge per statistically independent unit is @xmath388 for monovalent ions but roughly @xmath389 for one persistent segment of dna of length @xmath390 .",
    "therefore fluctuations are rather unimportant for the dna structure ( except for very large salt concentrations where a desorption transition does occur which can be treated using similar methods as used for the desorption of polyelectrolytes on planar substrates in the preceding section@xcite ) but are of extreme importance for the counterion clouds . to make these statements quantitative",

    "when the two contribution have equal magnitude ( roughly at @xmath401 ) the total free energy gain upon complexation is zero .",
    "this signals an entropy - driven unbinding transition which of course depends on the solution concentration of dna strands and histone spheres via the law - of - mass action@xcite .",
    "it follows that in some regions of the phase diagram shown in fig.[fig10 ] the complex is dissolved into its constituting parts , depending on the bulk concentrations .",

    "we compare two morphologies , namely a helical arrangement of the pe , where a single helix , characterized by the length ratio of the wrapped polymer section and the cylinder length , wraps around the cylinder ( see fig.[fig11]b ) , and the straight morphology , where @xmath410 parallel strands of pe adsorb on the cylinder .",
    "we minimize both configurational energies with respect to the relative amount of wrapped polyelectrolyte ( neglecting configurational fluctuations around the ground state which are unimportant for rather stiff and highly charged pes ) and compare the two resulting free energies to determine the stable phase .",
    "this comparison , which is done numerically in the general case , shows that both morphologies compete closely with each other .    as can be seen in the phase diagram fig.[fig12]a , which is obtained in the limit when the wrapping polymer is totally flexible and has no bending stiffness , @xmath411 ,",
    "the helical phase is favored at low salt concentrations ( to the left ) and highly charged wrapping polymers ( @xmath412 ) , while the parallel morphology is favored at high salt concentrations .",

    "experimentally , the coupling can be tuned by changing temperature , dielectric constant of the solvent , counterion valency / size and charge density of the pe .",
    "for very small coupling the pe resembles a neutral polymer since the electrostatic repulsion between monomers is very small . as the coupling increases",
    ", the monomer - monomer repulsion leads to a more swollen configuration ( the standard pe effect ) .",
    "however , as the coupling further increases , counterions condense on the pe , decrease the repulsion between monomers and the pe starts to shrink . finally , at very large electrostatic coupling , the pe is collapsed to a close - packed , almost charge - neutral condensate which contains most of its counterions .",

    "clearly , one would expect a whole number of interesting kinetic effects to turn up when polymers move in strong fields in viscous fluids .",
    "probably the most basic effect concerns a hydrodynamic mechanism for the orientation of polymers as they move through quiescent liquids .",
    "the arguments presented above show that charged polymers align along their long axis along an electric field .",
    "what happens when hydrodynamics are taken into account ?    for orthotropic bodies , that is for bodies with three mutually orthogonal planes of symmetry such as cylinders , the hydrodynamic coupling term between translational and rotational motion vanishes@xcite",
    "this result is valid only in the hydrodynamic limit of small reynolds numbers ( i.e. small bodies and low velocities ) , which is the relevant regime for almost all viscous solvent effects of nanoscopic materials .",
    "it implies that a _ rigid _ cylindrical particle , such as a rod - like synthetic or biological polymer , that is driven by a homogenous external force ( be it gravitational or electric in the case when the particle is charged ) and as a result is moving through a quiescent fluid , is hydrodynamically not oriented in any particular way : the orientational distribution function will be uniform , not favoring parallel or perpendicular orientation with respect to the direction of motion .",
    "in contrast , for _ elastic _ rods hydrodynamic effects lead to a bending and therefore reduction in symmetry@xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic translational - rotational coupling becomes finite and in consequence sedimenting rods orient perpendicularly to the direction of motion .",
    "this is graphically illustrated in fig.[rods ] where we show stationary shapes of a semiflexible polymer that is moving downwards under the action of a force acting uniformly on the monomers .",
    "the structures are obtained with a simulation code that takes hydrodynamics into account on the stokes or creeping - flow level , including the effects of elasticity and thermal fluctuations@xcite .",
    "the relevant parameters are the mechanical bending rigidity , expressed in terms of the bare persistence length @xmath358 , the total force acting on the rod , @xmath450 , related to an electric field @xmath451 via @xmath452 , and the length @xmath348 .",
    "the structures depicted in fig.[rods ] are obtained for rescaled driving forces of @xmath453 = 760 , 76,7.6 , from top to bottom .",
    "it is seen that the rod is deformed , but also that it is oriented with respect to the direction of motion .",
    "the mechanism is quite simple to understand : the external force drives all monomers in the same way ; due to hydrodynamic interactions , the effective force pushing the rod is larger in the middle of the rod than at the two ends , because the middle receives hydrodynamic thrust from both sides of neighboring segments .",
    "this imbalance in driving thrust is balanced by an elastic _ deformation _ , the rod bends .",
    "the rod bending reduces the symmetry and hydrodynamically couples translational and rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "the shift between the center of force ( i.e. mass ) and hydrodynamic stress produces an orienting torque , and as a result the bent rod is oriented perpendicularly to the direction of motion with the opening pointing backwards . since all materials have finite elastic moduli , this hydrodynamic orientation mechanism is universal and should be directly observable for sedimenting rods in an ultracentrifuge@xcite . in an ultracentrifuge , one can infer the change in average orientation since the mobility of a perpendicular long rod is smaller by a factor of two as compared with the mobility of a parallel rod .",
    "a variation in orientation can be induced by either changing the rod length or the driving field strength , the complete scaling functions ( including numerically determined prefactors ) are reported in @xcite .",
    "the average orientation of a variety of charged rod - like particles ( such as tobacco - mosaic@xcite and fd viruses@xcite , or different synthetic polyelectrolytes@xcite ) in electric fields has been determined in birefringence experiments .",
    "the anisotropic electric polarizability favors an orientation with the direction of the maximal polarizability parallel to the electric field , as seen in fig.[fig14 ] .",
    "the largest contribution to the polarizability is furnished by the easily deformable counterion cloud accompanying each charged particles , which is maximal along the long axis of the particle@xcite . as a result , charged rod - like particles are ( at not too low fields ) oriented in parallel with the electric field .",

    "another way of looking at this is to realize that the counterion concentration in the vicinity of a surface group increases when there are other charged surface groups close by ; this concentration increase of counterions ( among them protons ) drives the dissociation reaction backwards .",

    "in the simplified models used in the previous sections the presence of water was accounted for only by the presence of a uniform relative dielectric constant with the value @xmath501 . as is routinely done in most theoretical considerations , no other water effects",
    "were included , which works for many cases , but especially at surfaces is a highly questionable concept , as will be discussed now .",
    "for very large non - polar objects or in the limiting case of a planar hydrophobic substrate in contact with water , it is known since a long time that the water density is reduced at the hydrophobic surface and the structure of the interfacial water is very different from the bulk@xcite .",
    "clearly , this has important consequences for all material constants characterizing the solution ( dielectric constant , viscosity , screening length , @xmath502 ) close to the surface .",
    "it seems fair to say that without a proper characterization of the behavior of water at hydrophobic surfaces , no true understanding of the properties of such surfaces and their interactions will be possible .",
    "quite possibly , many of the features interpreted as being inherent to surfaces themselves , might in fact reflect properties of the interfacial water layer instead ( e.g. protein adsorption resistivity@xcite , zeta potentials@xcite , surface potentials@xcite , polymer - adsorption energies@xcite , just to mention a few ) .",
    "we will now consider the water density profile close to a planar surface using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . in md ,",
    "one basically integrates newton s equation of motion for an assembly of molecules or atoms , using heuristically chosen force parameterizations .",
    "the constant pressure ensemble is realized by adjusting the system volume . for simplicity",
    ", we only consider neutral walls , and in order to bring out the consequences of the presence of a wall most clearly , we deal with the special case of a very hydrophobic wall .",
    "the work described here was motivated by recent scattering experiments where the water density depletion at planar non - polar substrates was determined . as the main result of those experiments",
    ", it was shown that the effective depletion thickness ( defined as the thickness of a step - like depletion layer consisting of vacuum with the same integrated depleted amount as the rounded and smeared - out depletion profiles found in experiments ) is roughly 2.5 angstroms on hydrophobic poly - styrene substrates@xcite and 5 angstroms on hydrophobic self - assembled monolayers@xcite using neutron reflectivity methods , and about 1 angstrom on paraffin substrates using x - ray reflectivity measurements@xcite .",
    "the reason for the discrepancies among different experiments is not well understood , but since the strength of water depletion is reduced with decreasing radius of curvature of the hydrophobic solutes@xcite , it is clear that surface roughness is one important factor ( among many others , as e.g. small traces of attractive interactions between wall and water molecules ) and will , if present , reduce the depleted amount .    in the simulations , we built up the hydrophobic substrate by self assembled alkane chains which seems to be an acceptable representation of the substrate structure used in recent experiments@xcite . in figure [ wall]a ) a snapshot of the md simulation",
    "is shown , which serves to illustrate the geometry of the system@xcite .",
    "the alkane molecules form a compact slab in the middle of the simulation box .",
    "they are only allowed to fluctuate in the z - direction and thus allow for fast pressure equilibration .",
    "the water slab has a thickness of about 4 nanometers , which should be large enough such that bulk water properties are reproduced .",
    "we therefore interpret our results as being caused by the single hydrophobic substrate ",
    "water interface and neglect interactions between the two interfaces through the finite water slab .    in figure [ wall]b )",
    "we show the normalized densities of the alkane slab ( dotted line ) and the water layer ( solid line ) at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature t=300k .",
    "it is clearly seen that between the alkane slab and the water layer a region of reduced density appears .",
    "the density profiles are calculated using point - like atomic form factors and denote the nuclear density ; they therefore correspond to what would be seen in a neutron scattering experiment .",
    "the broken line denotes the laterally averaged interaction potential due to the alkane slab , in other words , this is the potential energy felt by the water molecules . at room temperature and normal pressure ,",
    "we obtain for the depletion thickness of a planar hydrophobic substrate the value @xmath503  , which is of the order of the length obtained in recent neutron scattering experiments@xcite and twice the length obtained with x - rays at hydrophobic substrates@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ wall]c the electrostatic potential across the interface is shown to change by about 0.5 v , which is due to the almost complete orientation of the topmost water layer .",
    "what do these results imply for charged surfaces",
    "? many of the charged surfaces used in experiments are in fact , if one forgets about the charged groups for a moment , of hydrophobic nature .",
    "let us assume for the sake of argument that the hydrophobic effects discussed above persist , even when charges are present .",
    "a layer of reduced water density at such surfaces means that the effective dielectric constant is reduced ; this suggests that i ) the association - dissociation equilibrium of surface charges is perturbed and ii ) that electrostatic interactions at hydrophobic surfaces in general might be stronger than anticipated based on simpler models .",
    "the viscosity at the surface will most likely be reduced which might be important in connection with electrokinetic effects .",
    "finally , the polarity of the top water layer is such that in principle ( i.e. neglecting ion - water interactions ) negative ions should be preferentially adsorbed on the surface .",
    "this is indeed borne out by recent md simulations@xcite , which however demonstrated an additional subtle dependence on the presence of ionic polarizabilities . for interactions between charged surfaces",
    "it is conceivable that the hydrophobic attraction due to the overlap of the depletion layers might very well dominate the resulting behavior .",
    "in the preceding sections , ions were either treated as point - like or as hard spheres . however , as has been recently reviewed@xcite , a large number of phenomena in colloid , polymer , and interface science that involve electrolytes show pronounced ion - specificity , as categorized in the famous hofmeister series@xcite .",
    "a striking experimental example of counterion specificity is obtained for the cationic surfactant discussed in section 3 .",
    "exchanging the bromine ion in ddab by a chlorine ion , the phase diagram changes dramatically and the phase coexistence disappears completely@xcite .",
    "a subset of these unresolved issues is typically associated with the so - called hydrophobic force , a rather long - ranged attraction between hydrophobic surfaces , which is much stronger than predicted from standard van - der - waals calculations and is also strongly ion - type - dependent@xcite .",
    "previous theoretical explanations invoked solvent - structure effects@xcite , and surface - specific ion interactions@xcite or charge - regulation phenomena@xcite .",
    "the presence of excess ionic polarizabilities was proposed to lead to corrections to the usual van - der - waals interaction energy , which could be one of the factors determining ion - specific interactions@xcite .",
    "but it was also shown that even with pure coulomb interactions , one obtains strong deviations from the standard mean - field approaches if one takes into account that the charge distribution on all charged surfaces is laterally modulated@xcite .",
    "specifically , the counterion density right at a charged surface ( which for a homogeneously charged surface and in the absence of additional interactions is exactly given by eq.([condit2 ] ) because of the contact - value theorem ) is for a modulated surface charge distribution increased .",
    "surface - charge inhomogeneities in that sense act like additional attractive interactions between surfaces and ions , but it should be clear that all the above - mentioned effects are present simultaneously .",
    "it is therefore not easy to disentangle these various factors , especially since experimentally one typically measures macroscopic quantities such as surface tension , ionic activities , ionic osmotic coefficients , etc . and not ionic distribution functions from which effective interactions between ions and surfaces could be deduced . as an additional complication , computer simulations , which would include all above mentioned effects , are still difficult to perform , even using coarse - grained models where one replaces explicit solvent by some suitably chosen dielectric constant plus solvent - induced effective interactions between solute molecules",
    "one therefore has to rely on various approximations , and it is often not easy to tell to what degree the approximation or the model parameters are responsible for the outcome .    how do we expect ion - specific effects to come into play on a microscopic level ? at any charged surface , one has chemical groups which carry most of the surface charge , i.e. , at which location the charge density is locally increased . the counterions ( or any other oppositely charged molecule ) will , due to coulomb interactions , be on average quite close to these surface groups ( in fact much closer than would be predicted according to poisson - boltzmann theory assuming a laterally homogeneous surface charge , compare section 4 ) , and it seems natural to surmise that it is the interaction between oppositely charged chemical groups that will be most susceptible to chemical specificity .",
    "this is not to say that solvent effects ( i.e. water structuring which of course is different for different ion types ) is unimportant , on the contrary , but it does not make sense to separate solvent - induced effects from the bare interactions between oppositely charged groups .",
    "one experimental example where the specificity is exhibited very clearly is with afm experiments for polyelectrolytes adsorbed on a variety of different substrates and in different electrolyte solutions@xcite , where the plateau desorption force can be directly converted into the binding energy per unit length .",
    "fortunately , progress in the available quantum - computational methodology allows to calculate effective interactions between charged species in an essentially ab - initio manner@xcite , including solvent effects@xcite . as a prototype for the effects studied ,",

    "the open stars denote results where electron correlations have been taken into account on the one - loop level ( hf - mp2 ) , the energy is slightly lower .",
    "one would expect that most of the long - ranged attraction seen in fig.[fig15]a is due to the coulomb attraction between the separated charges on the two ions . to make that notion quantitative",
    ", we first have to find out how much charge is transferred between the two ions . in fig.[fig15]b",

    "this ratio can be interpreted as the effective charge transfered between the two ions .",
    "it is seen that indeed charge transfer is almost perfect at large distances in which limit both ions are fully charged . for smaller distances polarization effects lead to a decrease of the transfered charge . in fig.[fig15]c",
    "we show the same data as in fig.[fig15]a but with the coulomb attraction @xmath504 subtracted ( note that the bjerrum length in vacuum measures @xmath505 ) .",

    "give roughly the same result , the difference between the two can be viewed as an estimate for the systematic error in the calculation ( an additional source of error is introduced due to the necessarily incomplete basis sets used ) .",

    "likewise , the interaction between ions in the bulk modifies the osmotic coefficients , the screening length , ionic activities and therefore gives an additional shift of the surface - group dissociation equilibrium . clearly , this interaction is highly specific and different for different ion types , especially at small distances .",
    "a hand - waving explanation why the very short - ranged properties of this interaction will be important is that oppositely charged ions are squeezed together such that the electron orbitals overlap to a degree where quantum - mechanical effects come into play .",

    "a number of different situations have been reviewed which have in common that electrostatic effects play a dominant role .",
    "this is achieved for highly charged surfaces and for highly charged polymers . among the most salient results we find simple explanations for the puzzling phenomena of attraction between similarly highly charged surfaces and overcompensation of charged surfaces by adsorbing polyelectrolytes . in general terms , it is the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction which lies at the heart of these effects .",
    "we also briefly talk about the effect of electric fields on strongly coupled charged systems .",
    "for the specific case of a collapsed charged polymer , an electric field induces motion of ions and charged monomers and for high enough fields disolves the complex .",
    "this is an intrinsic non - equilibrium phenomenon .",
    "finally , the interaction between oppositely charged chemical groups has been investigated using quantum - mechanical ab - initio methods . since in highly charged systems",
    "one often has intimate contacts between such groups , the short - ranged bonding we find is quite relevant for the understanding of experiments where ion - specific effects are present .",
    "one has only started to bridge the gap between the quantum - mechanical world at small distances and the mesoscopic world of primitive models ( where ions are replaced by hard spheres , and the solvent by a dielectric constant plus possibly effective interactions between the ions ) .",
    "what needs to be fully elucidated is the coupling between water structure close to ions and at charged surfaces and the effective interaction between such charged groups , which probably involves effective many - body interactions .",
    "experimentally evidenced ion - specific effects will turn out to be a stringent test for such theories .",
    "non - equilibrium phenomena are receiving more and more attention by theorists over the last years@xcite .",

    "<S> soft matter materials , such as polymers , membranes , proteins , are often electrically charged . </S>",

    "<S> one class comprises complexation between oppositely charged objects , for example the adsorption of charged ions or charged polymers on oppositely charged substrates of different geometry . here </S>",
    "<S> the main questions are whether adsorption occurs and what the effective charge of the resulting complex is . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly discuss the adsorption behavior of polyelectrolytes on substrates of planar , cylindrical and spherical geometry with specific reference to dna adsorption on supported charged lipid layers , dna adsorption on oppositely charged cylindrical dendro - polymers , and dna binding on globular histone proteins , respectively . in all these systems </S>",
    "<S> salt plays an important role , and some of the important features can already be obtained on the linear debye - hckel level . </S>",
    "<S> the second class comprises effective interactions between similarly charged objects . here </S>",
    "<S> the main theme is to understand the experimental finding that similarly and highly charged bodies attract each other in the presence of multi - valent counterions . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated using field - theoretic arguments as well as monte - carlo simulations for the case of two homogeneously charged bodies . </S>",
    "<S> realistic surfaces , on the other hand , are corrugated and also exhibit modulated charge distributions , which is important for static properties such as the counterion - density distribution , but has even more pronounced consequences for dynamic properties such as the counterion mobility . </S>",
    "<S> more pronounced dynamic effects are obtained with highly condensed charged systems in strong electric fields . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , an electrostatically collapsed highly charged polymer is unfolded and oriented in strong electric fields . </S>",
    "<S> all charged systems occur in water , and water by itself is not a very well understood material . at the end of this review </S>",
    "<S> , we give a very brief and incomplete account of the behavior of water at planar surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between water structure and charge effects is largely unexplored , and a few directions for future research are sketched . on an even more nanoscopic level , we demonstrate using ab - initio methods that specific interactions between oppositely charged groups ( which occur when their electron orbitals start to overlap ) are important and cause ion - specific effects that have recently moved into the focus of interest . </S>"
