    "in recent years the instanton liquid model has been very successful in describing the low energy properties of light hadrons @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it seems quite unlikely that instantons can account for confinement @xcite . this is certainly the case if the instanton liquid is sufficiently dilute and the instanton size distribution falls off rapidly enough for large instantons . if the fall - off is slow , e.g.  as @xmath0 or @xmath1 , a linear term in the heavy quark potential due to instantons has been claimed @xcite , although these results are controversial . still , a proper understanding of the tail of the instanton size distribution may have physical significance .",
    "unfortunately very little is known about it .",
    "lattice simulations are typically done on too small volumes and have too poor statistics to contain any precise information on the tail of the distribution . moreover , even the question of what non - perturbative mechanism suppresses large instantons is still unanswered , although some recent attempts have been made @xcite . in this paper",
    "we would like to make some remarks on these issues by studying the most general charge two instanton solution .",
    "our observations will be about the ( possible mis)interpretations of the lattice data .    in lattice determinations",
    "@xcite of the instanton liquid parameters one usually starts with the assumption that the liquid is dilute enough , i.e. the individual pseudoparticles are far enough apart that they do not distort one another considerably .",
    "only then does the `` instanton size '' have an unambiguous meaning . treating the @xmath2 case",
    "exactly can be thought of as the next order approximation when one takes into account the distorting effect of like charge nearest neighbour pairs .    to fix the notation",
    ", we start with briefly summarising the adhm construction @xcite of the general @xmath2 solution  @xcite .",
    "then we discuss the ambiguities arising in the identification between the `` physical '' parameters and the ones appearing in the adhm construction , giving rise to two dual descriptions of the same physical configuration .",
    "this duality maps large separation between the constituents to small separation @xcite and depends non - trivially on the relative gauge orientation of the two instantons .",
    "it has two important consequences for the identification of instantons from the charge density profile , most clearly seen in the two extreme cases .",
    "namely parallel and perpendicular relative gauge orientation ( the su(2 ) invariant angle being 0 and @xmath3 respectively ) .",
    "if the orientation is perpendicular , the two instantons can not be closer to each other than a minimal distance @xmath4 set by their sizes @xmath5 .",
    "if the relative orientation is parallel and the two constituents have the same size @xmath6 , when they get close to each other , the charge density looks like the super - imposition of a small instanton of size proportional to the separation , plus another instanton of size @xmath7 right under the small one .",
    "if the relative orientation and sizes are not fine tuned , some combination of the above effects will take place .",
    "the first effect controls how close two instantons can get to each other",
    ". the second one can potentially hide large instantons from instanton finding algorithms based on the diluteness assumption and thereby it can significantly distort the instanton size distribution . in the last part of the paper we present quantitative data on how these effects are manifested in realistic lattice situations .",
    "this is done by generating the charge density of instanton pairs , as given by the exact @xmath2 solutions , and comparing the size distribution thus prescribed by the original data with that found by lattice instanton finder algorithms .",
    "we observe that the results depend very strongly on the relative orientation in group space , yielding a strong suppression of large instantons for parallel orientation .",
    "the fundamental objects describing the most general su(2 ) charge @xmath8 instanton solution in the adhm construction are the @xmath8-dimensional row vector @xmath9 and the @xmath10 symmetric matrix @xmath11 , both having quaternionic elements @xcite .",
    "( a quaternion @xmath12 can be parametrised with 4 real numbers as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 are the pauli matrices . )",
    "the adhm data can be conveniently summarised in a single @xmath15 quaternionic matrix @xmath16 which in the @xmath2 case can be parametrised as @xmath17    @xmath16 describes a charge two self dual solution of the yang - mills equations if and only if the matrix @xmath16 satisfies the adhm constraint that @xmath18 be real quaternionic ( i.e. proportional to @xmath19 ) and invertible .",
    "here @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are quaternionic parameters , and @xmath24 denotes a space - time position . in terms of our parametrisation of the charge two case , the adhm constraint reads as @xmath25 where the symbol @xmath26 is introduced to simplify the notation .",
    "this equation does not specify @xmath23 unambiguously ; the most general solution can be written as @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an arbitrary real constant .",
    "at this point it is instructive to compare this most general adhm ansatz with the special case of the t hooft ansatz @xcite in order to identify the physical parameters .",
    "this special case is obtained for parallel gauge orientations , @xmath29 and @xmath30 real and @xmath31 , which solves the adhm constraint , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) .",
    "we can identify @xmath32 and @xmath33 as the scale parameters ( sizes ) , and @xmath34 as the locations of the two instantons .",
    "the action density of the solution , valid for all choices of parameters @xcite , @xmath35 indeed agrees in this case with the action density of the t hooft solution .    the most general charge two adhm solution can be described by the following set of free parameters : @xmath36 , the scale parameters ; latexmath:[$\\lambda_1^\\dagger \\lambda_2/(|\\lambda_1|     @xmath34 the location of the constituents .",
    "this gives a total number of 13 real parameters , in agreement with the general result that the charge @xmath8 solution has @xmath38 parameters .",
    "for @xmath2 the conformal generalisation of the t hooft ansatz @xcite also has 13 parameters , which can be related to the adhm parametrisation  @xcite .",
    "the charge @xmath8 adhm ansatz is well known to have an @xmath39 symmetry acting on the parameters as @xmath40 in the @xmath2 case , using our parametrisation , the @xmath41 symmetry amounts to @xmath42 while @xmath21 is left unchanged .",
    "the @xmath43 transformation that extends this to the full @xmath44 symmetry is generated by @xmath45 , which interchanges @xmath46 with @xmath47 and changes the sign of @xmath22 .",
    "different sets of parameters related by this @xmath44 symmetry describe the same physical solution @xcite @xmath48}f(x ) \\lambda^\\dagger\\right),\\quad f^{-1}(x)\\equiv\\delta^\\dagger(x)\\delta(x),\\ ] ] where @xmath49 . at first sight",
    "this seems to imply that we have one less free parameter .",
    "this is , however , compensated by the fact that , in general , solutions to the adhm constraint with different values of @xmath28 ( eq .  ( [ eq : u ] ) )",
    "result in physically different gauge field configurations , as one can easily be convinced of by computing @xmath50 .",
    "ideally one would like to fix this ambiguity together with the @xmath44 symmetry to have a one - to - one correspondence between the gauge inequivalent solutions and the 13 parameters describing them .",
    "our choice of these parameters , which we call `` physical '' , should be as close as possible to a superposition of two instantons .",
    "looking at the situation of large separations ( @xmath51 large ) , where the relative gauge orientation does not play a role , the action density should be the sum of two instantons of sizes @xmath52 located at @xmath34 .",
    "this imposes @xmath53 , or equivalently @xmath54 .",
    "( the equivalence of the two conditions can be easily proved using eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) and @xmath55 which holds for any two quaternions @xmath56 and @xmath57 . ) choosing this particular solution to the constraint ensures that when the orientation of the constituents is parallel , the adhm solution coincides with the t hooft ansatz .    with this convention",
    "the identification of the `` physical '' parameters becomes almost unique .",
    "the prescription is that from each @xmath44 orbit we have to choose the point that satisfies @xmath58 . generally or @xmath59 .",
    "] there are 16 such points on an @xmath44 orbit describing the same gauge field configuration , as has been noted before @xcite .",
    "they are generated by rotations ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : o(2 ) ] ) ) over multiples of @xmath60 and the @xmath43 transformation , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "most of these do not affect the `` physical '' interpretation .",
    "but one ambiguity remains for which we choose the representative described by the @xmath43 symmetry ( @xmath45 ) combined with the rotation over @xmath63 , providing the relation @xmath64 we note that if the distance of the two instantons is @xmath65 in one description , it is proportional to @xmath66 in the `` dual '' description , as long as the relative gauge orientation is not parallel ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "going beyond the issue of finding a unique parametrisation , the question now arises which of these two descriptions is the `` physical '' one . to answer this",
    "it is instructive to look at the charge density profile of a set of solutions with varying separations , keeping the other parameters fixed .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] we show such a sequence .",
    "the parametrisation listed is in terms of the l.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ eq : duality ] ) .",
    "the scale parameters and relative orientation are described by @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and the separation between the constituents is _ always _ along the 0-axis .",
    "when they are far apart ( a ) , corresponding to @xmath70 , the solution indeed looks like a pair of instantons along the 0-axis . as the separation decreases",
    "the two lumps merge together into an asymmetric ring ( b - c ) ( @xmath71 and 10.5 respectively ) .",
    "for even smaller separation : @xmath72 ,",
    "( d ) in the figure , the two lumps separate again but now displaced along the 1-axis . clearly , our parametrisation is not `` physical '' any more at this stage ; instead of two very close lumps separated along the 0-axis , we see two lumps farther apart but along the perpendicular 1-axis . on the other hand",
    ", we also have the dual parametrisation ( r.h.s .",
    "( [ eq : duality ] ) ) at our disposal .",
    "indeed , a short computation shows that in the dual description of ( d ) we have two instantons of the same scale parameter @xmath73 separated along the 1-axis at a distance of 22 , evidently the correct `` physical '' description .",
    "the general picture emerging from this exercise is quite clear .",
    "when @xmath51 is large , more precisely @xmath74 , the original description is `` physical '' , i.e. describing two superposed instantons separated by a distance @xmath65 .",
    "when @xmath51 is small , however , the dual description is the more `` physical '' one .",
    "there is an intermediate region where the solution can not be approximated by a combination of two instantons , here the question which parameter set to use for the physical description is ill defined .    in the rest of this section",
    "we discuss two simple consequences of this dual choice of parametrisation .",
    "the first one is that two instantons , as identified from maxima in the action density , can never get closer to each other than a minimal distance @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the invariant angle of the relative group orientation .",
    "@xmath77 is defined by the property that the two dual descriptions have the same separation @xmath78 between the constituents .",
    "if @xmath51 is chosen to be smaller than this , the two instantons `` scatter off '' in the @xmath79 direction and one has to switch to the dual description .",
    "it is also interesting to observe the very special case when @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in this case",
    ", @xmath82 gives a self - dual point where the two parametrisations completely coincide and the charge density has an axial symmetry in the @xmath83 plane .",
    "for these parameters the density profile is ring - like , not unlike the case of monopoles @xcite , but apparently not noted before for instantons . in particular , the solution does not degenerate to one with topological charge @xmath84 , as conjectured in ref .",
    "this _ only _ happens in the case of parallel gauge orientation , for @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : duality1 ] ) below ) .",
    "the discussion so far applies only to the @xmath67 case .",
    "moreover , if @xmath87 , then the switching between the two parametrisations occurs at very small @xmath51 ( see eq.([eq : zmin ] ) ) and other interesting effects might come into play when the two constituents are very close .",
    "let us now look at the extreme situation when @xmath88 , the relative orientation is parallel and consequently @xmath89 . in this case",
    "the two parametrisations are @xmath90 in the limit @xmath91 the two descriptions become equivalent , there is no way to choose between them .",
    "one can see that two instantons of scale parameters @xmath52 ( @xmath92 ) on top of each other is equivalent to a small instanton of size @xmath93 on top of a larger one of size @xmath94 .",
    "in this extreme case any lattice instanton finder based on the diluteness assumption would find only the former smaller instanton and nothing else .",
    "moreover due to the strongly non - linear character of the yang - mills equations , when two instantons come close with parallel orientation , both peaks become narrower and sharper and are thus identified by any lattice algorithm as `` small '' instantons .",
    "at best one misses one large instanton in the background ; at worst one misinterprets two large instantons as two small ones .",
    "the effect is similar at @xmath87 and can provide a mechanism to hide large instantons as some smooth background that remains unnoticed by lattice instanton finder algorithms .",
    "we have seen how the identification of single instanton parameters becomes ambiguous when instantons overlap .",
    "we discussed what happens in the two extreme cases of parallel and perpendicular orientation in group space . in between , some combination of the two above described effects takes place .",
    "we expect that the exact way this affects the instanton size distributions measured on the lattice will depend on the relative orientation of nearest neighbour pairs .    in the remainder of the paper we study numerically how the relative orientation can affect the lattice instanton size distribution .",
    "in order to see the trends as clearly as possible , instead of trying to mimic the `` real '' distribution of relative orientations , we use two simple orientation distributions : the haar measure , and all instantons taken parallel . due to the @xmath95 factor , the haar measure very strongly favours ( close to ) perpendicular orientation , thus our two distributions almost represent the two possible extremes . we generated the charge density of a set of instanton pairs with the adhm construction using eq .",
    "( [ eq : charge ] ) .",
    "the parameters of the adhm ansatz were taken as follows .",
    "the instanton scale parameters @xmath96 were distributed independently and qualitatively similar to that found on the lattice , except for an enhanced tail ( for @xmath6 large ) .",
    "we artificially enhanced the tail of the distribution in order to test whether such a tail can remain undetected by the lattice instanton finders .",
    "the separation @xmath65 was gaussian distributed with mean 7.0 , and variance of 1.0",
    ".    the resulting charge densities  each pair resolved on a @xmath97 grid  were then analysed using two different instanton finder algorithms @xcite .",
    "the details of these algorithms are not relevant in the present context .",
    "however their most important common feature is that they are both based on the dilute gas assumption .",
    "they identify the highest peaks in the charge density and estimate the instanton sizes from the fall - off of the density in the vicinity of the maximum .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : haar_all ] we show the instanton size distributions found by the algorithms of refs .",
    "@xcite ( dotted line ) and @xcite ( dashed line ) along with the distribution of the adhm size parameters used to construct the charge densities ( solid line ) , representing the physical choice of parameters .",
    "the haar measure was used for the gauge orientation .",
    "one of the instanton finders seems to somewhat suppress the enhanced tail while this effect is not significant with the other .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : par_all ] we plotted the size distributions obtained when all the pairs were taken parallely oriented in group space .",
    "all the conventions are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : haar_all ] . here",
    "the two instanton finders both yield a significantly suppressed tail .",
    "we also considered ensembles ( not shown ) which in terms of the relative orientation are in between the two shown .",
    "we can draw the following general conclusion .",
    "the two instanton finders display the same trend ; the more parallel the pair is in group space the more suppressed the large instantons become .",
    "this is partly due to the effect that large instantons can `` hide '' under small ones that produce sharper peaks in the charge density .",
    "the other effect is that , when two instantons come close with approximately parallel orientation , they look narrower and are thus interpreted by the lattice algorithm as `` small '' instantons",
    "to summarise , we studied the question of what happens when the instanton liquid is not dilute enough to be considered as a collection of individual pseudoparticles .",
    "the next approximation is to treat nearest pairs of like charge exactly .",
    "we established a correspondence between the parameters of individual instantons and the parameters of the charge two adhm construction .",
    "after fixing most of the ambiguities of this correspondence we still have two dual sets of parameters describing the same charge two instanton solution .",
    "this duality turned out to imply the existence of a minimal distance between the two instantons , which is maximal in the case of perpendicular orientation . in the other extreme case of ( nearly ) parallel orientation , we found that instanton finders based on the diluteness assumption can have a tendency to miss large instantons or to underestimate instanton sizes .",
    "we numerically confirmed that this indeed happens for realistic parameters of the instanton liquid and the effect becomes larger for orientations closer to being parallel .",
    "in fact , a recent lattice study indicates that like charge pairs strongly favour parallel orientation compared to the haar measure @xcite , therefore the effect we found can be potentially important .",
