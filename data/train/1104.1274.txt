    "as shown in @xcite the linear noise approximation provides a useful and reliable framework for both modelling and statistical inference .",
    "it is valid for systems with large number of reacting molecules and is an analogy of the central limit theorem for markov jump processes defined by cme @xcite .",

    "the macroscopic state is described by an ode ( [ mre ] ) , the macroscopic rate equation ( mre ) , which in general needs to be solved numerically .",
    "stochastic fluctuations @xmath18 are governed by a wiener process ( @xmath19 ) driven linear stochastic differential equation ( [ xi ] ) with an explicit solution readily available ( see si ) . the variance @xmath20 of the system s state @xmath21 can be explicitly written in terms of an ode @xmath22 which is equivalent to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "similarly , temporal covariances are given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the fundamental matrix of the non - autonomous system of odes @xmath25 equations ( [ decomp_phi_xi]-[fundamental ] ) are used to derive the likelihood of experimental data . to account for different experimental settings we consider three types of data : time series ( ts ) , time - point ( tp ) and deterministic ( dt ) .",

    "tp measurements at each time point are taken from different trajectories ( end time points of trajectories following different cells ) and are thus independent .",
    "these data reflect experimental setups where the sample is sacrificed and the sequence of measurements is not strictly associated with the same sample path ( e.g. flow - cytometry , q - pcr ) .",

    "we consider the case where at each time point @xmath28 all components of @xmath29 are measured . in the si",
    "we demonstrate that the same analysis can be done for a model with unobserved variables at no extra cost other than more complex notation .",
    "first let @xmath30 be an @xmath31 column vector that contains all measurements of type @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "it can be shown ( see si ) that @xmath34 where mvn denotes the multivariate normal distribution , @xmath35 and @xmath36 is a solution of the mre ( [ mre ] ) such that @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a @xmath39 symmetric block matrix @xmath40 such that    @xmath41    and @xmath42 is a solution of eq .",

    "the mvn likelihood is a result of our lna and is analogous to the central limit theorem for the cme .",
    "it is valid under the assumption of large number of molecules reacting in the system @xcite .",
    "to calculate the fim for the model @xmath44 , first , suppose that a random variable @xmath45 has an @xmath1-variate normal distribution with density @xmath46 , mean @xmath47 and covariance matrix @xmath48 .",

    "( [ sigma_all_t ] ) describe mean and variance , respectively , of experimental measurements , @xmath57 .",
    "the mean is given as the solution of an ode , and the variance is either given as a product of solutions of odes ( ts ) , directly as a solution of an ode ( [ variance ] ) ( tp ) , or is simply constant ( dt ) .",
    "hence , in order to calculate the fim we calculate the derivatives of the solutions of an ode with respect to the parameters @xcite . for illustration , consider an @xmath1 dimensional ode @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a scalar parameter .",

    "we can thus calculate derivatives @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 that give @xmath55 and @xmath56 needed to compute fim for the model ( 1 - 3 ) ( see si ) .",
    "+ the fim is of special significance for model analysis as it constitutes a tool for sensitivity analysis , robustness , identifiability and optimal experimental design as we will show below .",
    "the classical sensitivity coefficient for an observable @xmath32 and parameter @xmath59 is @xmath70 the behaviour of a stochastic system is defined by observables that are drawn from a probability distribution .",
    "the fim is a measure of how this distribution changes in response to infinitesimal changes in parameters .",

    "than , @xmath73,\\ ] ] i.e. the fim is the expected hessian of @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath75 is the maximum likelihood estimate of a parameter there is a @xmath76 orthogonal matrix @xmath77 such that , in the new parameters @xmath78 , @xmath79 for @xmath80 near @xmath75 . from this",
    "it follows that the @xmath81 are the eigenvalues of the fim and that the matrix @xmath77 diagonalises it .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath81 are ordered so that @xmath82 then it follows that around the maximum the likelihood is most sensitive when @xmath83 is varied and least sensitive when @xmath84 is varied , and @xmath81 is a measure of this . since @xmath85 we can regard @xmath86 as the contribution of the parameter @xmath87 to varying @xmath88 and thus @xmath89 can be regarded as a measure of the sensitivity of the system to @xmath87 .",
    "it is sometimes appropriate to normalise this and instead consider @xmath90      related to sensitivity , robustness in systems biology is usually understood as persistence of a system to perturbations to external conditions @xcite .",
    "sensitivity considers perturbation in a single parameter whereas robustness takes into account simultaneous changes in all model parameters .",
    "near to the maximum @xmath75 the regions of high expected log - likelihood @xmath91 are approximately the ellipsoids @xmath92 given by the equation @xmath93 the ellipsoids have principal directions given by eigenvectors @xmath77 and equatorial radii @xmath94 .",
    "sets @xmath95 are called neutral spaces as they describe regions of parameter space in which a system s behaviour does not undergo significant changes @xcite and arise naturally in the analysis of robustness .",
    "the asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimators implies that if @xmath75 is a maximum likelihood estimator then the ns describe confidence ellipsoids for @xmath80 with confidence levels corresponding to @xmath96 . the equatorial radii decrease naturally with the square root of the sample size @xcite .",
    "the fim is of special significance for model analysis as it constitutes a classical criterion for parameter identifiability @xcite .",
    "there exist various definitions of parameter identifiability and here we consider local identifiability .",
    "the parameter vector @xmath80 is said to be ( locally ) identifiable if there exists a neighbourhood of @xmath80 such that no other vector @xmath75 in this neighbourhood gives raise to the same density as @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "formula ( [ ell ] ) implies that @xmath80 is ( structurally ) identifiable if and only if fim has a full rank @xcite .",
    "therefore the number of non - zero eigenvalues of fim is equal to the number of identifiable parameters , or more precisely , to the number of identifiable linear combinations of parameters .",
    "+ the fim is also a key tool to construct experiments in such a way that the parameters can be estimated from the resulting experimental data with the highest possible statistical quality .",
    "the theory of optimal experimental design uses various criteria to asses information content of experimental sampling methods ; among the most popular are the concepts of d - optimality that maximises the determinant of fim , and a - optimality that minimise the trace of the inverse of fim @xcite .",
    "diagonal elements of the inverse of fim constitute a lower - bound for the variance of any unbiased estimator of elements of @xmath80 ; this is known as the cramer - rao inequality ( see si ) .",
    "finally , it is important to keep in mind that some parameters may be structurally identifiable , but not be identifiable in practice due to noise ; these would correspond to small but non - zero eigenvalues of the fim . maximizing the number of eigen - values above some threshold",
    "which reflects experimental resolution , may therefore be a further criterion to optimize experimental design . but all of these criteria revolve around being able to evaluate the fim .",
    "in order to demonstrate the applicability of the presented methodology for calculation of fims for stochastic models we consider two examples : a simple model of single gene expression , and a model of the p53 system . the simplicity of the first model allows us to explain how the differences between deterministic and stochastic versions of the model as well as ts and tp data arise . in the case of the p53 system model the informational content , as well as sensitivities and neutral spaces are compared between ts , tp and dt data .",
    "although gene expression involves numerous biochemical reactions , the currently accepted consensus is to model it in terms of only three biochemical species ( dna , mrna , and protein ) and four reaction channels ( transcription , mrna degradation , translation , and protein degradation ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such a simple model has been used successfully in a variety of applications and can generate data with the same statistical behaviour as more complicated models @xcite .",
    "we assume that the process begins with the production of mrna molecules @xmath97 at rate @xmath98 .",
    "each mrna molecule may be independently translated into protein molecules @xmath99 at rate @xmath100 .",
    "both mrna and protein molecules are degraded at rates @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "therefore , we have the state vector @xmath103 , and reaction rates corresponding to transcription of mrna , translation , degradation of mrna , and degradation of protein .",
    "@xmath104 _ identifiability study .",
    "_ in a typical experiment only protein levels are measured @xcite .",
    "it is not entirely clear _ a priori _ what parameters of gene expression can be inferred ; it is also not obvious if and how the answer depends on the nature of the data ( i.e. ts , tp or dt ) .",
    "we address these questions below .",
    "+ we assumed that the system has reached the unique steady state defined by the model and that only protein level is measured either as ts @xmath105 or as tp @xmath106 where the upper indices for tp measurements denote the number of trajectories from which the measurement have been taken to emphasise independence of measurements .",
    "results of the analysis are presented in table 2 si . for ts data we have four identifiable parameters whereas time - point measurements provide enough information to estimate only two parameters . to some extent",
    "this makes intuitive sense : ts data contain information about mean , variance and autocorrelation functions , which can be very sensitive to changes in degradation rates ; tp measurements reflect only information about mean and variance of protein levels therefore only two parameters are identifiable . on the other hand",
    "tp measurements provide independent samples which is reflected in lower cramer - rao bounds .",
    "table 2 si contains also a comparison with the corresponding deterministic model . as one might expect in the deterministic model",
    "only one parameter is identifiable as the mean is the only quantity that is described by the deterministic model , and parameter estimates are informed neither by variability nor by autocorrelation .",
    "+ _ perturbation experiment .",
    "_ in order to demonstrate that identifiability is not a model specific but rather an experiment specific feature we performed a similar analysis as above for the same model with the same parameters but with the 5 fold increased initial mean and 25 fold increased initial variance .",
    "results are presented in table 3 si .",
    "some of the conclusions that can be made are hard to predict without calculating the fim .",
    "the amount of information in ts data is now much larger than in tp data ( higher determinant ) and also cr bounds are now much lower for tp than for ts data .",
    "cr bounds for ts and tp are substantially lower than for the steady state data ( except @xmath98 ) .",
    "interestingly , all four parameters can be inferred from ts and tp data , but not in the deterministic scenario . for steady state data all parameters",
    "could only be inferred from ts data ( table 3 si ) .",
    "+ _ maximising the information content of experimental data . _",
    "the amount of information in a sample does not depend solely on the type of data ( ts , tp ) , but also on other factors that can be controlled in an experiment .",
    "one easily controllable quantity is the sampling frequency @xmath107 .",
    "we consider here only equidistant sampling and keep number of measurements constant .",
    "therefore we define @xmath107 as time between subsequent observations @xmath108 . to show how sampling frequency influences informational content of a sample for the model of gene expression we used four parameter sets ( table 1 si ) and assumed that the data have the form ( [ data_gene_ts ] ) .",
    "the amount of information in a sample was understood as the determinant of the fim , equivalent to the product of the eigenvalues of the fim .",
    "results in figure [ figure_gene_det_fim ] demonstrate that our method can be used to determine optimal sampling frequency , given that at least some rough estimates of model parameters are known .",
    "it is worth noting that equidistant sampling is not always the best option and more complex strategies have been proposed in experimental design literature .",
    "_ differences in sensitivity and robustness analysis in ts , tp and dt versions of the model .",
    "_ ts , tp and dt versions of the model differ when one considers information content of samples , and such discrepancies exist also when sensitivity and robustness are studied .",
    "first , deterministic models completely neglect variability in molecular species .",
    "variability , however , is a function of parameters , and like the mean , is sensitive to them .",
    "second , deterministic models do not include correlations between molecular species .",
    "third , temporal correlations are neglected in tp and dt models .",
    "+ to understand these effects we first analyse the analytical form of means , variances and correlations for this model ( see si ) .",
    "we start with the effect of incorporating variability .",
    "suppose we consider a change in parameters , e.g. @xmath109 by a factor @xmath110 @xmath111 .",
    "the means of rna and protein concentrations are not affected by this perturbation , whereas the protein variance does change ( see formulae ( 33 - 37 ) in si ) .",
    "this result is related to the number of non - zero eigenvalues of the fim .",
    "the fim for the stationary distribution of this model with respect to parameters @xmath109 has only one positive eigenvalue for the deterministic model and two positive eigenvalues for the stochastic model . + to study the effect of correlation between rna and protein levels @xmath112 we first note that formulae ( 33 - 37 ) in si demonstrate that at constant mean , correlation increases with @xmath102 when accompanied by a compensating increase in @xmath100 .",
    "figure [ gene_slop ] ( left column ) presents neutral spaces ( [ np ] ) for parameter pairs for different values of correlation , @xmath112 .",
    "the differences between dt and ts are enhanced by the correlation .",
    "+ similar analysis reveals that taking account of the temporal correlations also changes the way the model responds to parameter perturbations .",
    "figure [ gene_slop ] ( right column ) shows neutral spaces for three different sampling frequencies and indicates that the differences between stochastic and deterministic models decrease with @xmath107 .",
    "the model of single gene expression is a linear model with only four parameters and a simple stationary state and illustrates how the methodology can be used to provide relevant conclusions and investigate discrepancies between sensitivities of ts , tp and dt models .",
    "our methodology , however , can also be used to study more complex models , and here we have chosen the p53 signalling system , which incorporates a feedback loop between the tumour suppressor p53 and the oncogene mdm2 , and is involved in regulation of cell cycle and response to dna damage .",
    "+ we use the model introduced in @xcite that reduces the system to three molecular species , p53 , mdm2 precursor and mdm2 , denoted here by @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "the state of the system is therefore given by @xmath115 , and the seven reactions present in the model are described by the stoichiometry matrix @xmath116 and occur at rates @xmath117 so that the vector of model parameters can be written as @xmath118 the above specification allow us to formulate a macroscopic rate equation model @xmath119 _ informational content of ts and tp data for the p53 system .",
    "_ in the case of the single gene expression model we have argued that ts data are more informative due to accounting for temporal correlations . on the other hand",
    "tp measurements provide statistically independent samples , which should increase informational content of the data .",
    "therefore it is not entirely clear what data type is better for a particular parameter .",
    "if , for instance , a parameter is entirely informed by a system s mean behaviour than tp data will be more informative because tp data provide statistically independent samples about the mean .",
    "whereas if a parameter is also informed by temporal correlations , then ts data will turn out to be more informative .",
    "it is difficult to predict _ a priori _ which effect will be dominating",
    ". therefore calculation of fim and comparison of their eigenvalues and diagonal elements is necessary .",
    "eigenvalues and diagonal elements of fims calculated for parameters presented in table 4 si are plotted in figure [ p53ev ] and figure [ p53_diag_sens ] , respectively .",
    "eigenvalues of the fim for ts data are larger than for tp data .",
    "similarly , diagonal elements for all parameters are larger for tp than for ts data for most parameters difference is substantial .",
    "this indicates that temporal correlation is a sensitive feature of this system and provides significant information about model parameters .",
    "the lower information content of the tp data can , however , be compensated for by increasing the number of independent measurements , which is easily achievable in current experimental settings ( see figure 7 si ) . for deterministic models",
    "the absolute value of elements of fim depends on measurement error variance and therefore fims of ts and tp data can not be directly compared with the dt model . + _ sensitivity . _",
    "the sensitivity coefficients @xmath120 for ts , tp and dt data are presented in figure [ p53_diag_sens ] . despite differences outlined previously , here sensitivity coefficients are quite similar for all three types suggesting that the hierarchy of sensitive parameters is to a considerable degree independent on the type of data .",
    "the differences exist , however , in contributions @xmath121 ( see figure 6 in si ) , suggesting discrepancies in neutral spaces and robustness analysis that we present below .",
    "+ _ neutral spaces .",
    "_ comparison of the neutral spaces ( [ np ] ) for each pair of data types and for each pair of the parameters are given in figures 3 - 5 si .",
    "the conclusion we can draw from these figures is that nss for ts , tp and dt model exhibit substantial differences ; these differences , however , are limited to certain parameter pairs .",
    "differences between nps of ts and dt models are exhibited in pairs involving parameters @xmath122 , @xmath123 ; between ts and tp in pairs involving @xmath122 ; and between tp and dt also pairs involving @xmath122 .",
    "+ this suggests that parameter @xmath122 is responsible either for the variability in molecular numbers or the correlation between species , as these are responsible for differences between tp and dt models .",
    "similarly the lack of differences in pairs involving @xmath123 in comparisons of tp and dt , and their presence in comparison of tp and ts indicates that parameter @xmath123 is responsible for regulating the temporal correlations .",
    "this analysis agrees with what one might intuitively predict .",
    "parameter @xmath122 describes the production rate , and therefore the mean expression level of p53 , and also the variability of all components of the system .",
    "it is difficult , however , to say how this parameter influences correlations between species .",
    "parameter @xmath123 , on the other hand , is the degradation rate of mdm2 and therefore clearly determines the temporal correlation of not only mdm2 but also of p53 , because mdm2 regulates the degradation rate of p53 .",
    "while heuristic , our analysis of the neutral spaces nevertheless clearly demonstrates the differences between the three types of models and creates a theoretical framework for investigating the role of parameters in the stochastic chemical kinetics systems and without the need to perform monte carlo sampling or other computationally expensive schemes .",
    "the aim of this paper was to introduce a novel theoretical framework that allows us to gain insights into sensitivity and robustness of stochastic reaction systems through analysis of the fim .",
    "we have used the linear noise approximation @xcite to model means , variances and correlations in terms of appropriate odes . differentiating the solution of these odes with respect to parameters",
    "@xcite allowed us to numerically calculate derivatives of means , variances and correlations , which combined with the normal distribution of model variables implied by the lna gave us the representation of the fim in terms of solutions of odes . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first method to compute fim for stochastic chemical kinetics models without the need for monte carlo simulations .",
    "+ given the role of the fim in model analysis and increasing interest in stochastic models of biochemical reactions , our approach is widely applicable .",
    "it is primarily aimed at optimising or guiding experimental design , and here we have shown how it can be used to test parameter identifiability for different data types , determine optimal sampling frequencies , examine information content of experimental samples and calculate cramer - rao bounds for kinetic parameter estimates .",
    "its applicability , however , extends much further : it can provide a rationale as to which variables should be measured experimentally , or what perturbation should be applied to a system in order to obtain relevant information about parameters of interest .",
    "similar strategies can also be employed in order to optimise model selection procedures .",
    "as demonstrated here stochastic data incorporating information about noise structure are more informative and therefore experimental optimisation for stochastic models models may be advantageous over similar methods for deterministic models .",
    "+ a second topical application area is the study of robustness of stochastic systems .",
    "interest in robustnesses results from the observation that biochemical systems exhibit surprising stability in function under various environmental conditions . for deterministic models",
    "this phenomenon has been partly explained by the existence of regions in parameter space ( neutral spaces ) @xcite , in which perturbations to parameters do not result in significant changes in system output .",
    "we have demonstrated that even a very simple stochastic linear model of gene expression exhibits substantial differences when its neutral spaces are compared with the deterministic counterpart . therefore a stochastic system may respond differently to changes in external conditions than the corresponding deterministic model .",
    "our study presents examples of changes in parameters that do not affect behaviour of a deterministic systems but may substantially change a probability distribution that defines the behaviour of the corresponding stochastic system .",
    "thus for systems in which stochasticity plays an important role random effects can not be neglected when considering issues related to robustness .",

    "<S> similarly , identifiability analysis uses the concept of sensitivity to determine _ a priori _ whether certain parameters can be estimated from experimental data of a given type @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + we use the linear noise approximation ( lna ) as a continuous approximation to markov jump processes defined by the chemical master equation ( cme ) . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation has previously been used successfully for modelling as well as for inference @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> applying the lna allows us to represent the fisher information matrix ( fim ) as a solution of a set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use this framework to investigate model robustness , study the information content of experimental samples and calculate cramr - rao ( cr ) bounds for model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> analysis is performed for time series ( ts ) and time point ( tp ) data as well as for a corresponding deterministic ( dt ) model . </S>",
    "<S> results are compared with each other and provide novel insights into the consequences of stochasticity in biochemical systems . </S>",
    "<S> two biological examples are used to demonstrate our approach and its usefulness : a simple model of gene expression and a model of the p53 system . </S>",
    "<S> we show that substantial differences in the structure of fims exist between stochastic and deterministic versions of these models . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , discrepancies appear also between stochastic models with different data types ( ts , tp ) , and these can have significant impact on sensitivity , robustness and parameter identifiability . we demonstrate that differences arise from general variability in the number of molecules , correlation between them and temporal correlations . </S>"
