    "the emergence of coordinated behavior between humans is a common phenomenon in many areas of human endeavor .",
    "examples include improvisation theater , group dance , music playing , team sports and parade marching @xcite . at the core of the interaction between the players",
    "lies a fundamental feedback mechanism where each player adapts his / her motion in response to the observed movement of the other .    to study this intriguing phenomenon ,",
    "the mirror game has been recently proposed as a simple , yet effective paradigm . in its simplest formulation ,",
    "the mirror game features two people imitating each other s movements at high temporal and spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "the game can be played in different experimental conditions : the former where one of the players leads and the other has to follow the leader movement ( leader - follower condition ) ; the latter where the two players create joint synchronized movement ( joint improvisation condition ) .",
    "the theory of similarity in social psychology suggests that people prefer to team up with others possessing similar morphological and behavioral features , and that interpersonal coordination is enhanced if their movement shares similar kinematic features @xcite .",
    "further evidence suggests that motor processes caused by interpersonal coordination are strictly related to mental connectedness .",
    "to be specific , motor coordination between two people contributes to social attachment @xcite .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , coordination games can therefore be used to help people suffering from social disorders to improve their social skills .",
    "also they can be effectively exploited in social robotics to enhance attachment , coordination and rehabilitation during human - robot interactions @xcite .",
    "for this reason , it has been proposed that creating a vp or avatar able to coordinate its motion with that of a hp can be extremely useful to study the onset of coordination and how it is affected by similarity / dissimilarity between the players motion characteristics @xcite .",
    "a vp can also be used for diagnostics and rehabilitation of patients suffering from social disorders as recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is the design of a novel interactive cognitive architecture ( ica ) based on nonlinear control theory able to drive a vp to play the mirror game with a human either as a leader or as a follower .",
    "specifically , the goal is that of designing a cognitive architecture able to drive the motion of the vp interacting with a hp in real - time while exhibiting certain desired kinematic features .",
    "when playing as a follower , the ica needs to guarantee that , while exhibiting the desired movement properties , the vp tracks as closely as possible the motion of the human leader .",
    "when playing as the leader , the ica needs instead to generate new interesting motion . in both cases , it is crucial for the vp to engage with the hp by producing human - like response in terms of kinematics ( maximum acceleration , velocity profile etc ) and delay times . in this paper",
    "we take the view that the design of such an architecture is fundamentally a nonlinear control design problem where given some reference input the architecture has to drive the vp onto a desired motion which is a function of the movement of the human player being sensed during the game .",
    "in particular , the ica can be integrated into the humanoid robot to achieve the desired dual - arm coordination @xcite .",
    "we explore two different approaches , one based on adaptive control , the other on optimal control .",
    "our control architecture mimics the two fundamental actions which have been suggested to be at the core of the emergence of motor coordination between two or more effectors in biological systems : feedback and feedforward @xcite .",
    "specifically , the motor system is able to correct the deviation from the desired movement with the aid of feedback control , whilst feedforward control allows it to reconcile the interdependency of the involved effectors and preplan the response to the sensory incoming information @xcite .",
    "it is shown experimentally that the proposed control architectures are able to effectively drive the vp to play the mirror game while generating motion with desired kinematic properties .",
    "in particular , we use the concept of individual motor signature ( ims ) recently proposed in @xcite to characterize the motion of an individual player and evaluate how similar / dissimilar the motion of two different individuals is .",
    "following our approach we are able to show that the vp driven by the cognitive architecture presented in the rest of this paper can play the mirror game either as a leader or a follower while exhibiting a desired ims .",
    "relevant previous work in the literature includes the generation of human - like movement @xcite , the development of a mathematical model to explain the coordination dynamics observed experimentally in the mirror game @xcite , and the human dynamic clamp paradigm proposed in @xcite where the use of a virtual partner driven by appropriate mathematical models is proposed to study human motor coordination .",
    "these previous approaches will be used to investigate and compare the performance of the novel strategy presented in this paper .",
    "we wish to emphasize that the control algorithms developed and validated in what follows can be also effectively used for trajectory planning to enhance human - robot coordination in joint interactive tasks .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the mirror game set - up , problem statement and motor signature are discussed in section [ sec : problem ] before presenting the schematic of the proposed cognitive architecture in section [ sec : ca ] .",
    "the feedback control strategies at the core of the ica are developed and analyzed in section [ sec : adaptive ] and [ sec : optimal ] .",
    "the experimental validation of the control algorithms is presented in section [ sec : validation ] where experimental results are discussed showing the effectiveness of the proposed strategies .",
    "a comparison with other existing approaches is also carried out .",
    "finally , conclusions and suggestions for future work are drawn in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "investigation of interpersonal coordination requires appropriate experimental paradigms .",
    "a typical paradigm recently proposed in the literature is the mirror game , which involves two people imitating each other s movements at high temporal and spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "it can be played in two different conditions : _ leader - follower condition _ , where the follower attempts at tracking the leader motion as accurately as possible , and _ joint improvisation condition _ , where the players jointly coordinate and synchronize their movements without any of the two being designated as leader or follower .",
    "our set - up is inspired by the one in @xcite .",
    "specifically , a small orange ball is mounted onto a string , which the hp can move back and forth along the string itself . in the meanwhile ,",
    "the vp on the opposite screen moves its own ball on a parallel string with the same length ( see fig . [ setup ] ) . in this implementation of the mirror game ,",
    "two players ( a hp and a vp ) are required to move their respective ball back and forth and synchronize their movement . here",
    ", we assume that the game is played in a leader - follower condition , where the hp is the leader and the vp ( robot or computer avatar ) is the follower trying to track the leader movement .",
    "however , the vp can opt to act as the leader as well .",
    "[ 0.25]experimental set - up of the mirror game between a vp and a hp at the university of montpellier , france ( see @xcite for further details).,title=\"fig : \" ]    the position of the ball moved by the hp is detected by a camera .",
    "a feedback control strategy then needs to be designed in order to generate the trajectory of the ball moved by the vp so as to track the movement of the ball controlled by the hp .",
    "such a trajectory can then be provided to the on - board controllers of the vp ( robot or computer avatar ) as the desired trajectory for its end effector .    to solve this control problem so that the vp motion presents similar features to the motion of a human player , we need to choose an appropriate model of the vp motion that can then be controlled using a nonlinear feedback strategy . to this purpose , here we use the haken - kelso - bunz oscillator , which was first proposed in @xcite as a model able to capture the observations made in experiments on human bimanual coordination .",
    "the model consists of two nonlinearly coupled nonlinear oscillators described by @xmath0(\\dot{z}-\\dot{w})\\ ] ] where @xmath1 represent the position and velocity of finger @xmath2 , @xmath3 the position and velocity of finger @xmath4 ( modeled by a replica of the equation above obtained by swapping @xmath3 with @xmath5 ) ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the coupling parameters and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 characterize the response of each uncoupled finger when subject to some reference signal .",
    "however , it is worth pointing out that , other than describing intrapersonal motor coordination , the hkb model has been also used to describe interpersonal motor coordination involving two different people @xcite . in particular , the hkb oscillator has been suggested in the literature as a paradigmatic example of human motor coordination @xcite . solving the mirror game can then be formulated as the following control problem .",
    "given a nonlinear hkb oscillator of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 refer to the position and velocity of the end effector of the vp , respectively , and @xmath15 is an external control input , the problem is to design a feedback controller @xmath15 such that @xmath16 achieves bounded asymptotic tracking of the position of the hp , while expressing some desired kinematic features .",
    "as metrics to characterize the kinematic properties of the motion of an individual playing the game we use the concept of individual motor signature ( ims ) , recently introduced in @xcite . it has been shown that the ims is time invariant and is unique for each player .",
    "it is defined in terms of the velocity profile ( or distribution ) of the player s motion in solo trials . to quantify how similar or dissimilar the signatures of two different players are",
    ", we use the earth mover s distance ( emd ) between any two probability distribution functions ( pdf ) of their velocity time series @xcite .",
    "the emd between two pdfs @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be computed as follows @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the integration domain , and @xmath21 denotes the cumulative distribution function of the distribution @xmath22 .",
    "fig.[pdf_vel](a ) shows the position time series of the same hp and the corresponding pdf of velocity in two solo trials .",
    "it is visible that the two pdfs of velocity time series resemble each other in terms of their shape , and the emd between them is @xmath23 .",
    "in contrast , the two pdfs of velocity time series in fig.[pdf_vel](b ) differ remarkably from each other , and the value of emd is @xmath24 , which confirms the qualification of the pdf of velocity time series in solo trials as individual motor signature .",

    "[ human ] ) .",
    "the visual system detects the ball s position on the string and generates visual signals , which are then transmitted to the central nervous system ( cns including brain and spinal cord ) .",
    "several parts of the cns ( such as ventral horn , cerebellum and motor cortex ) use an internal model to predict the kinematic characteristics of the other player s motion and generate the neural impulses that control the extension and contraction of muscles .",
    "finally , the neuromuscular system activates and coordinates the muscles involved in generating the hand movements .",
    "this architecture is mapped onto the real - time control schematics shown in fig .",
    "[ sig ] whose blocks are briefly described below .    *",
    "a _ camera _ is used to detect the position of the hp , say @xmath25 ; * a _ filtering and velocity estimation block _ is used to filter the position data acquired by the camera via a low pass filter and to estimate the velocity of the hp ( reference ) via the simple formula @xmath26\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 denotes the sampling period of the camera .",
    "the estimated velocity is then used to predict the hp position over the next interval by using the expression : @xmath29\\ ] ] + as an alternative , we could adopt a nonlinear observer to provide a better prediction of the reference velocity ; for example , the nonlinear extended observer in @xcite . here we find that such a complication is unnecessary to solve the problem of interest and therefore choose to use the simple yet effective estimation strategy discussed above .",
    "* at the core of the architecture lie the two blocks _ temporal correspondence control _ and _ signature control_. the former is designed to regulate the end effector model so that its motion tracks that of the hp with varying degrees of dynamic similarity .",
    "specifically , it aims at minimizing the position error between the time series of the hp and that of the vp .",
    "the latter block uses the prerecorded velocity time series of a reference hp with the desired ims ( velocity profile ) in order to generate the avatar trajectory with desired kinematic features .",
    "in particular , the aim of the signature controller is that of reducing the distance ( computed in terms of emd ) between the velocity distribution of the vp and that of some reference hp it aims at replicating the motion characteristics of .",
    "* the prerecorded velocity trajectory of a reference hp playing solo representing the desired ims is stored in the _ signature generator block _ while the signature of the avatar motion is estimated by the _ signature estimation block_. * the _ end effector model _ is used to generate the avatar motion via an appropriate feedback control scheme . as mentioned before",
    ", we use the hkb oscillator to describe the dynamics of the end effector . *",
    "finally , the output of the cognitive architecture ( position and velocity @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) is used as the reference motion for the vp .    in what follows we focus on the design of the feedback control strategies that drive the cognitive architecture .",
    "we derive and compare two different types of controllers .",
    "first we develop an adaptive algorithm able to control the temporal correspondence between the vp and the hp during the game ( green blocks in fig.[sig ] ) .",
    "then , we consider an optimal controller to solve simultaneously the multi objective control problem of tracking the trajectory of the hp while preserving the features of the desired ims of interest ( both green and blue blocks in fig.[sig ] ) . for both strategies a proof of convergence is given before presenting numerical and experimental investigation of their performance .",
    "to solve the control problem of temporal correspondence , we propose an adaptive controller based on the end effector model shown in ( [ system ] ) . specifically , we choose the nonlinear controller given by @xmath30(\\dot{x}-\\hat{r}_v)}_{coordination}-\\underbrace{c_pe^{-\\delta ( \\dot{x}-\\hat{r}_v)^2}(x - r_p)}_{temporal~correspondence}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the position of the hp , @xmath31 is the estimated velocity , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are constant parameters while the coupling parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are updated according to the adaptive laws : @xmath34-\\eta_a \\end{split}\\ ] ] and @xmath35-\\eta_a \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is a positive constant .",
    "note that the control law ( [ eq : u ] ) consists of two complementary terms .",
    "the first has the same structure as the one of the coupling proposed in @xcite to model the interaction between two hps , albeit with the introduction of adaptive parameters to account for variability between different hps .",
    "the second term , depending on the fixed parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 , deals with the position error when the velocity mismatch approaches zero and hence the first term decays to zero .",
    "when @xmath37 is relatively large , the coupling term of the hkb equation instead dominates and motor coordination between the two players becomes more pronounced during the mirror game .",

    "we presented the novel design of an interactive cognitive architecture able to drive a virtual player to play the mirror game against a human player .",
    "two strategies were developed .",
    "the first , based on adaptive control , was shown to be effective to achieve temporal correspondence between the motion of the virtual player and that of the human individual .",
    "convergence of the algorithm was proved .",
    "it was noticed that the adaptive control strategy does not allow the vp to exhibit some desired kinematic features ( individual motor signature ) of a given human player . to overcome this limitation , a different strategy based on the iterative solution of an appropriate optimal control problem",
