    "of the @xmath2 collective modes in @xmath3he - b , the imaginary squashing ( isq ) mode has been measured with considerably less precision than the real squashing ( rsq ) mode .",

    "has not been possible for the isq mode .",
    "to first order , these modes have frequencies proportional to the gap : @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( rsq ) and @xmath6 ( isq ) .",
    "measurements have shown that the rsq mode frequencies deviate from this value and sauls and serene@xcite have shown that this is because the collective mode frequencies are strongly influenced by both quasi - particle interaction effects and @xmath7-wave pairing .",
    "we have made measurements using the interference of transverse sound in an acoustic cavity to resolve the isq mode frequencies with greater precision than previously reported .",

    "an acoustic cavity is formed from an _ ac_-cut quartz transducer and a reflecting plate separated by monodispersed latex microspheres . using an electrical - impedance spectrometer in a bridge configuration ,",
    "we have measured the transverse acoustic impedance of superfluid @xmath3he as a function of temperature at high frequencies .",
    "the acoustic impedance is given by@xcite @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the complex phase velocity and @xmath10 .",
    "the acoustic impedance is simultaneously sensitive to changes in the ( normal fluid ) density , @xmath11 ; phase velocity , @xmath12 ; and attenuation , @xmath13 .",
    "[ data ] displays the acoustic impedance as the temperature is lowered through the imaginary squashing mode at a fixed transverse sound frequency .",
    "as the temperature nears that of the isq mode , transverse sound begins to propagate due to off - resonant coupling to the mode@xcite , as described in eq .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) .",
    "this results in the interference pattern seen on the high temperature side of the mode .",
    "the attenuation decreases with decreasing temperature and the interference oscillations become larger . with further decrease in temperature the pattern",
    "is quenched owing to resonant coupling to the isq , which increases the attenuation .",
    "the standing transverse waves reappear on the low temperature side of the isq mode and finally die off as the off - resonant coupling becomes weak .",

    "( color on - line ) the period shift analysis for determining the temperature of the isq mode crossing at 99.9484 mhz and 9.31 bar .",
    "high and low temperature data are fit independently to give the temperatures of zero period shift , which are then averaged to assign the isq mode crossing .",
    "this temperature is indicated in fig .",
    "[ data ] by the arrow.,width=240 ]    the proximity to the isq mode determines the phase velocity , resulting in the period of the oscillations becoming smaller upon approaching the mode crossing .",
    "we have used the period of the oscillations , to precisely determine the crossing of the transverse sound mode with the imaginary squashing mode .",
    "we plot the temperature difference between the peak and trough of the acoustic impedance versus their average temperature for one particular frequency and pressure in fig .",

    "the data on either side of the mode are independently fit to determine at what temperature the period goes to zero .",
    "the position of the isq mode at the measurement frequency is assigned to be the average of these two temperatures .",
    "this is repeated for all pressures and frequencies . in fig .",
    "[ results ] , we plot the isq mode as @xmath14 versus reduced temperature .",
    "strong coupling is taken into account , by using the weak - coupling plus form@xcite of the gap , @xmath15 , as tabulated in ref . .",
    "to take data at a fixed acoustic frequency we can tune the gap amplitude by varying the pressure over a small range .",
    "for the lowest frequency data the pressure variation was @xmath16 0.5 bar , increasing to @xmath16 1 bar at the highest frequency .",
    "data taken in this way can be converted to a constant pressure , using eq .",
    "( [ freq ] ) . the data in fig .",
    "[ results ] is plotted for fixed pressures .",
    "the temperature of the mode crossings have an uncertainty between 5 and 15 @xmath17 , yielding an uncertainty in @xmath14 between 0.1% and 0.25% .",

    "they have shown that the dispersion of transverse sound is given by , @xmath19 + \\frac{2f_1^{s}}{75}\\lambda(\\omega , t)\\\\      \\times\\frac{\\omega^{2}}{(\\omega+i\\gamma(t))^{2 } - \\omega_{2^{-}}(t , p)^{2 } - \\frac{2}{5}q^{2}v_f^{2}},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the fermi velocity , @xmath21 is the measurement frequency , @xmath22 is the isq mode frequency , @xmath23 is the tsuneto function and @xmath24 is a fermi liquid parameter derived from measurement of the heat capacity .",
    "@xmath25 is the width of the mode , with an approximate form@xcite of @xmath26 and @xmath27 hz .",
    "it is this mode width that allows for transverse sound propagation at temperatures below the isq mode . solving eq .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) at temperatures low compared with @xmath28 , where the first term goes to zero , one finds that there are no corrections to the mode frequencies because of non - zero @xmath29 , so - called dispersion corrections .",

    "the line is an unconstrained fit to the data and demonstrates the internal consistency of the analysis .",

    "one expects that @xmath36 if quasiparticle and @xmath7-wave interactions are negligible and corrections to the temperature scale@xcite are insignificant .",

    "we have made new precision measurements of the imaginary squashing mode as a function of pressure .",
    "this precision derives from our use of the interference of high frequency transverse sound in an acoustic cavity and comparison with the theory of moores and sauls@xcite .",
    "the measurements reveal that the mode frequencies lie above the value of @xmath38 . extrapolating fits of the zero temperature isq mode frequencies to zero pressure recovers this value . in a future paper",
