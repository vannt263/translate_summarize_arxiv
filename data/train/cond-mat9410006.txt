    "they become smaller and smaller in the ordered regions as the system size @xmath224 increases and the points at which the crossover behaviors set in become closer and closer to the estimated critical - interaction strength @xmath134 .",

    "9(c ) shows the values of @xmath31 obtained from the relation @xmath226 .",
    "the coupling constant estimated in this way is in good agreement with that obtained from the transfer matrix spectra .",

    "we conclude that the phase transition belongs to the universality class of the kt transition .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the phase transitions in the idw model .",
    "there are three phases : the @xmath1 and @xmath0 c phases and the ic phase .",
    "the transition between the @xmath1 c phase and the ic phase is the pt transition when the interactions between domain walls are repulsive or weakly attractive .",
    "when the interaction is strongly attractive , it becomes the first - order phase transition with a discontinuity of the domain - wall density .",
    "the nature of the transitions are altered because of formation of bounded domain - wall states . as to the transition between the @xmath0 c phase and the ic phase",
    ", we suggested the free - energy functional is that of the gaussian model with a symmetry - breaking field with the scaling dimension @xmath35 .",
    "the symmetry - breaking field accounts for effects of the repulsive interaction and induces the kt transition from the critical phase to the ordered phase .",
    "we confirmed this scenario by calculating the stiffness constants from the monte carlo simulations . from the transfer matrix method , we calculated the gaussian coupling constant in the ic phase and the critical interaction strength .",
    "phase boundaries in the @xmath46-@xmath45 plane are also determined from the transfer matrix method .",
    "the domain - wall model is constructed from the tafim with the restriction that three spins on elementary triangles can not have the same sign .",
    "if this is allowed the excitation of this type constitutes a topological excitation where two - domain walls are created or annihilated  @xcite .",
    "it plays the role of vortex and antivortex excitation in the xy model .",
    "the scaling dimension of the excitation is @xmath227 . since it is irrelevant when @xmath228 , it can not alter the nature of the c - ic transition of the @xmath0 c phase where @xmath37  @xcite .    in the pidw model where the interaction and the chemical potential is anisotropic",
    "the repulsive interaction stabilizes the @xmath30 c phase .",
    "but , the phase transition is of the pt type .",
    "thus the anisotropy plays an important role in determining the nature of the phase transition .",
    "the anisotropy produces an extra term in the free - energy functional which couples to the differences of the number of domain walls of type 1 and 2 .",
    "so the pidw model would be described by the effective free - energy functional @xmath229\\ ] ] where the symmetry - breaking field accounts for the ordering induced from domain - wall interactions and the linear term @xmath230 accounts for the effect of the anisotropy . in this model ,",
    "the phase transition is induced by the coupling @xmath231 .",
    "it induces a domain - wall type excitation and the phase transition is in the universality class of the pt transition  @xcite .",
    "even though we studied only the equilibrium properties of the idw model in this work , non - equilibrium version is also of interest since it describes a driven domain - wall model or the hypercube stacking model  @xcite and also the charge conduction in the charge - density - wave system  @xcite .",
    "we leave it for further study .",
    "this work is supported by korea science and engineering foundation through the center for theoretical physics , and also by ministry of education through basic science research institute , of seoul national university .      in this appendix",
    ", we derive expressions for the largest eigenvalue @xmath232 and the corresponding eigenket @xmath233 of the transfer matrix @xmath109 for @xmath152 analytically .",
    "the eigenket is of the form @xmath234 where @xmath235 denotes a state with two domain walls at sites @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "the eigenvalue equation @xmath238 : @xmath239 when @xmath240 is applied to a stateket @xmath235 , it generates a new stateket : @xmath241 where @xmath71 is the interaction parameter .",
