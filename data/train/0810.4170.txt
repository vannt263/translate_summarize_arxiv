    "over the last decade a concordance model has emerged in cosmology in which about two - thirds of the energy density of the universe today may be in the form of dark energy .",
    "this explains the observation that we reside in an accelerating universe ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) . despite its importance to the formation and evolution of the universe",
    "there are no compelling theories that explain the energy density or the properties of dark energy .    to address questions about the nature of dark energy a number of ambitious wide - field optical and infrared imaging surveys have been proposed .",
    "these range from space - based missions in the optical and infrared , such as the supernova acceleration probe ( snap , proposed as the space - based joint dark energy mission ( jdem ) ) , and the dark energy universe explore ( dune ) , to ground - based surveys such as the panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) , the dark energy survey ( des ) , the subaru weak lensing survey ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2006 ) , the large synoptic sky survey ( lsst ) and others .",
    "each of these missions approaches the study of dark energy using multiple , complementary observational probes : gravitational weak lensing ( wl ) to study the growth of structure and geometry , baryon oscillations to measure the angular diameter distance vs. redshift relation , and type ia supernovae to measure the luminosity distance vs. redshift relation .",
    "in this paper we focus on one of these probes , weak lensing or the so - called cosmic shear , the bending of light by intervening mass distribution that causes images of distant galaxies to be distorted ( e.g. bartelmann & schneider 2001 for a thorough review ) .",
    "these sheared source galaxies are mostly too weakly distorted for us to measure the effect on single galaxies , but require large surveys containing millions of galaxies to detect the signal in a statistical way .",
    "the conventional method used for measuring cosmic shear is the two - point correlation function whose fourier - transform is the shear power spectrum .",
    "cosmic shear correlations have been observed by various groups and used to constrain cosmological parameters ( most recently by fu et al .",
    "2008 using the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) ) .",
    "lensing tomography refers to the use of depth information in the source galaxies to get three - dimensional information about the lensing mass ( hu 1999 ; huterer 2002 ; heavens 2003 ; takada & jain 2004 ; song & knox 2004 ; takada & white 2004 ; also see hoekstra & jain 2008 for a recent review ) . by binning source galaxies in photometric redshift bins",
    ", the evolution of the lensing power spectrum can be measured as a function of redshift and angular scale .",
    "this greatly improves the sensitivity of lensing to the geometry of the universe as well as the growth of mass clustering , both of which are sensitive to the nature of dark energy .",
    "this method has emerged as one of the most promising to obtain precise constraints on the nature of dark energy if the systematic errors are well under control ( e.g. , albrecht et al .",
    "2006 ) .    given the resources required for such surveys , it is important to understand the statistical precision of cosmic shear observables and error propagation in determination of cosmological parameters . since cosmic shear probes the projected mass distribution , the statistical properties of the cosmic shear field reflect those of the mass distribution . for the case of the cosmic shear power spectrum ,",
    "its statistical precision is determined by the covariance that contains three kinds of contributions : the shot noise contamination due to intrinsic ellipticities , and the gaussian and non - gaussian sample variances caused by the imperfect sampling of the fluctuations ( scoccimarro et al .",
    "1999 ; cooray & hu 2001 ) .",
    "the non - gaussian sample variance arises from the projection of the mass trispectrum weighted with the lensing efficiency kernel .",
    "in fact most of the useful cosmological information contained in the lensing power spectrum lies on small angular scales that are affected by nonlinear clustering .",
    "therefore non - gaussian errors can be significant in weak lensing measurements as indicated by a few previous studies based on ray tracing simulations ( white & hu 2000 ; semboloni et al .",
    "2007 ) and the halo model approach ( cooray & hu 2001 ; pielorz 2008 ) .",
    "however , the importance of non - gaussian errors is not yet fully understood , especially in terms of the prospects of future surveys for constraining dark energy .",
    "this will be also important in exploring optimal survey design for planned surveys .",
    "therefore , the aim of this paper is to study the covariances of the lensing power spectrum based on the halo model approach ( cooray & sheth 2002 for a thorough review ) , and to estimate the impact of the non - gaussian errors on the power spectrum measurement as well as on the determination of cosmological parameters .",
    "we also study how the effect of the non - gaussian errors varies with survey parameters ( depth and area ) and in the presence of systematic errors  photometric redshift errors and shear calibration errors .",
    "our analysis includes new sources of non - gaussian errors that inevitably arise for a finite survey area , called the beat - coupling effect .",
    "this was pointed out by rimes & hamilton 2005 for the case of the 3d mass power spectrum ( also see hamilton et al .",
    "2006 ; sefussati et al .",
    "2006 ; neyrinck et al .",
    "2006 ) . more explicitly ,",
    "if the scale of interest is embedded in a large - scale ( of order the survey size ) overdensity or underdensity , then the small scale fluctuations we want to measure may have grown more rapidly or slowly than the ensemble average .",
    "this is predicted by perturbation theory for gravitational clustering .",
    "this physical correlations with the unseen large - scale fluctuations may add uncertainties in measuring the power spectrum at scales of interest .",
    "very recently , lee & pen ( 2008 ) claimed that , by studying the angular power spectrum of the sdss galaxy distribution ( i.e. not directly from lensing data ) , the effect of non - gaussian errors is very significant on angular scales of @xmath2 arcminutes : they found that the cumulative signal - to - noise ratio integrated over a range of multipoles is two orders of magnitude lower than the case of the gaussian fluctuations . since galaxies are related to the lensing mass fluctuations ,",
    "does this imply that the non - gaussian errors significantly degrade the ability of lensing surveys to constrain cosmology ?",
    "this is the issue we would like to carefully address in this paper .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we define the lensing power spectrum in the context of lensing tomography in section  [ sec : prelim ] and the lensing covariances including the beat - coupling effect in section  [ sec : cov ] . in section  [ sec : results ] we show the results for the impact of non - gaussian covariances on the power spectrum measurement and parameter estimations . in section  [ sec:2ptcov ]",
    "we study the covariances for the cosmic shear correlation functions .",
    "section  [ sec : discuss ] is devoted to a discussion of our conclusions .",
    "we will throughout this paper work in the context of a spatially flat cold dark matter model for structure formation .",
    "the expansion history of the universe is given by the scale factor @xmath3 in a homogeneous and isotropic universe ( e.g. , see dodelson 2003 ) .",
    "the expansion rate , @xmath4 , is specified once the matter density @xmath5 ( the cold dark matter plus the baryons ) and dark energy density @xmath6 at present in units of the critical density @xmath7 are given , where @xmath8 is the hubble parameter at present : @xmath9,\\ ] ] where we have employed the normalization @xmath10 today and @xmath11 specifies the equation of state for dark energy as @xmath12 .",
    "note that @xmath13 and @xmath14 corresponds to a cosmological constant .",
    "the comoving distance @xmath15 from an observer at @xmath16 to a source at @xmath17 is expressed in terms of the hubble expansion rate as @xmath18 this gives the distance - redshift relation @xmath19 via the relation @xmath20 .",
    "next we need the redshift growth of density perturbations . in linear theory after matter - radiation equality , all fourier modes of the mass density perturbation , @xmath21 , grow at the same rate , the growth rate ( e.g. see eqn .  10 in takada 2006 for details ) .",
    "note that throughout this paper we ignore effects of finite mass neutrinos and clustered dark energy on the growth rate , causing a scale - dependent growth rate ( e.g. , saito et al .",
    "2008 ; takada 2006 ) .",
    "gravitational shear can be simply related to the lensing convergence : the weighted mass distribution integrated along the line of sight ( e.g. , see mellier 1999 ; bartelmann & schneider 2001 ; schneider 2006 for thorough reviews ) .",
    "photometric redshift information on source galaxies allows us to subdivide galaxies into redshift bins , enabling more cosmological information to be extracted , which is referred to as lensing tomography ( e.g. , hu 1999 ; huterer 2002 ; takada & jain 2004 ) . in the context of cosmological gravitational lensing the convergence field with tomographic information is expressed as a weighted projection of the three - dimensional mass density fluctuation field : @xmath22 , \\label{eqn : kappa}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the angular position on the sky , @xmath24 is the comoving angular diameter distance , and @xmath25 is the distance to the hubble horizon . the lensing weight function @xmath26 in the @xmath27-th redshift bin , defined to lie between the comoving distances @xmath28 and @xmath29 ,",
    "is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the redshift selection function of source galaxies , which is normalized as @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the average number density of galaxies per unit steradian ( see around eqn .  [ [ eqn : ns ] ] in ",
    "[ sec : modelparas ] for our definition of the source redshift distribution ) .",
    "also @xmath35 is the average number density of sub - sample galaxies in the @xmath27-th redshift bin defined as @xmath36 the cosmic shear fields are measurable only in a statistical sense .",
    "the most conventional methods used in the literature are the shear two - point correlation function .",
    "the fourier transformed counterpart is the shear power spectrum . for lensing tomography of @xmath37 redshift bins , using the flat - sky and limber s approximations ( limber 1954 ) , there are @xmath38 spectra available : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the three - dimensional mass power spectrum .",
    "note that hereafter the quantities with subscript `` @xmath41 '' denote those of the mass density fluctuations",
    ". for @xmath42 the major contribution to @xmath43 comes from non - linear clustering ( e.g. , see fig .  2 in takada & jain 2004 ) .",
    "we employ the fitting formula for the non - linear @xmath40 proposed in smith et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , assuming that it can be applied to dark energy cosmologies by replacing the growth rate used in the formula with that for a given dark energy model .",
    "we note in passing that the issue of accurate power spectra for general dark energy cosmologies still needs to be addressed carefully ( huterer & takada 2005 ; also see ma 2007 for the related discussion ) .    as can be found form eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : ps ] ) , the lensing power spectra contain cosmological information via both the lensing efficiency kernel and the mass clustering information contained in @xmath44 , e.g. which almost equally contribute to the final sensitivity to dark energy parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - gaussian errors of the lensing fields arise from the non - gaussianity of the nonlinear mass clustering in structure formation .",
    "thus , even if the underlying mass distribution is highly non - gaussian , the cosmological information the lensing carries would be to some extent preserved via the lensing efficiency kernel , which is one of notable differences from other methods such as the galaxy power spectrum .    in reality",
    ", the observed power spectrum is contaminated by the intrinsic ellipticity noise .",
    "assuming that the intrinsic ellipticity distribution is uncorrelated between different galaxies , the observed power spectrum between redshift bins @xmath27 and @xmath45 can be expressed as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the rms intrinsic ellipticities per component .",
    "note that the kronecker delta symbol @xmath48 accounts for the fact that the cross - spectra with @xmath49 are not contaminated by the shot noise .",
    "therefore the shot noise contamination needs not be subtracted from the estimated cross spectra that would reduce residual uncertainties in practice .",
    "in reality the lensing power spectrum has to be estimated from the fourier or spherical harmonic coefficients of the observed lensing fields constructed for a finite survey . in this paper",
    "we assume the flat - sky approximation and thus use fourier wavenumbers @xmath50 , which are equivalent to spherical harmonic multipoles @xmath50 in the limit @xmath51 ( hu 2000 ) .",
    "because the survey is finite , an infinite number of fourier modes are not available , and rather the discrete fourier decomposition has to be constructed in terms of the fundamental mode that is limited by the survey size as will be in detail discussed below .",
    "we assume a homogeneous survey geometry for simplicity and do not consider any complex boundary and/or masking effects . for this case ,",
    "as shown in appendix b of takada & bridle ( 2007 ) , the lensing power spectrum of the @xmath17-th multipole bin , @xmath52 , may be estimated as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the survey area , the integration range is confined to the fourier modes lying in the annulus of a given width , @xmath55 and @xmath56 denotes the integration area in the fourier space approximately given by @xmath57 for the case of @xmath58 . throughout this paper",
    "we use the subscripts @xmath59 to denote the multipole bins , while we use the subscripts @xmath60 or @xmath61 to denote the redshift bins .",
    "once an estimator of the lensing power spectrum is defined , it is straightforward to compute the covariance ( scoccimarro et al 1999 ; cooray & hu 2001 ; takada & bridle 2007 ) .",
    "the covariance of cosmic shear power spectra describes statistical uncertainties of the power spectrum measurement for a given survey as well as how two spectra at different multipole and/or redshift bins are correlated with each other . extending the formulation developed in scoccimarro et al .",

    "we have shown two contributions to the covariance : the terms in the square brackets constitute the gaussian contribution , and last term is the non - gaussian term which is given by the lensing trispectrum @xmath65 defined as @xmath66 in the limber approximation , @xmath65 is a simple projection of the 3d mass trispectrum @xmath67 given as @xmath68 with @xmath69 and so on . finally , the indices @xmath70 in the covariance matrix of eqn .",

    "it should be also noted that the non - gaussian term does not depend on the multipole bin width @xmath80 ( because @xmath81 ) , so increasing @xmath80 only reduces the gaussian contribution .",

    "the shaded boxes around the solid curve show the expected gaussian errors on the power spectrum for the assumed survey .",
    "the shot noise contribution to the gaussian errors becomes greater than the sample variance at wavenumbers @xmath50 greater than the intersection of the power spectrum points with the shot noise line ( dashed ) .",
    "the horizontal and vertical error bars demonstrate the impact of the non - gaussian errors on the power spectrum measurements at each multipole bins .",
    "there are two effects .",
    "first , the neighboring multipole bins are not independent : the width of each horizontal error bar represents the range of multipoles where the cross - correlation coefficient of power spectra ( around the central multipole in that bin ) is greater than 0.1 ( see   [ sec : pca ] for the details ) .",
    "second , the vertical error bars show the increase in the power spectrum measurement uncertainties due to non - gaussian errors .",
    "these are significant over the range @xmath82 , where ( a ) nonlinear clustering is important , and ( b ) sample variance dominates over shot noise .      as pointed out in hamilton , rimes & scoccimarro ( 2006",
    "; also see rimes & hamilton 2005 and sefussati et al .",
    "2006 ) , there is an additional contribution to the covariance arising from the imperfect sampling of the fourier modes due to a finite survey area , which we will often refer as to the _ beat - coupling _ contamination . for a finite survey of size @xmath83 ( we will hereafter assume a survey area of @xmath84 for simplicity ) ,",

    "note that , since the power spectrum depends only on the _ length _ of wavenumber @xmath91 in a statistically homogeneous and isotropic universe , an estimation of the power spectrum of wavenumber @xmath50 is not affected by the uncertainty principle as long as it is smoothly varying and @xmath92 : @xmath93 hence , the gaussian error term in the covariance ( [ eqn : pscov ] ) is not affected by the beat - coupling contamination .    for the non - gaussian term , there is a non - vanishing contribution due the beat - coupling effect . even for @xmath94",
    ", nonlinear clustering predicts non - vanishing correlations between the modes with wavevectors @xmath95 and @xmath86 .",
    "surprisingly , this effect yields additional contribution to the covariance that are not negligible , as we show below ( and as shown by rimes & hamilton 2005 for the 3d power spectrum ) .      to compute the lensing power spectrum covariance using eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : pscov ] ) , we need to model the mass trispectrum .",
    "the model predictions need to describe the non - linear regime of clustering because most of the useful cosmological information in lensing is contained on small angular scales . in this paper",

    "2001 ; also see cooray & sheth 2002 for a review ) , where the @xmath96-point correlations of the mass distribution are modeled in terms of two separate contributions : correlation of dark matter particles within one halo , and correlations of particles in different halos . in previous work we have found that , up to the 4-point correlation functions , the halo model gives fairly accurate predictions to match @xmath97-body simulation results at @xmath98 level ( takada & jain 2002 , 2003a , b ) .",
    "for our purpose , the halo model prescription is reasonably adequate ; we discuss possible improvements below .",

    "( [ eqn : trisp_m ] ) we have dropped the 2- and 3-halo term contributions .",
    "we have thus assumed that the full trispectrum is well approximated by the sum of the 1-halo term and the perturbation theory prediction .",
    "our rationale for this approximation is : ( 1 ) the 1-halo term is dominant in the highly non - linear regime , while in the linear regime the gaussian assumption for the errors is sufficient .",

    "takada & jain ( 2003b ) showed for example that the the lensing three - point functions computed in this manner are in better agreement with the simulations than the standard halo model predictions ( 1- , 2- plus 3-halo terms ) .",

    "the covariance of the mass power spectra at two wevenumbers @xmath314 and @xmath315 arises from the 4-point correlations of @xmath316 with specific configurations in fourier space : @xmath317 , because of @xmath318 and so on .",

    "( [ eqn : lensng_pt ] ) can be obtained .",
    "although a rather mathematical derivation of the beat - coupling was described above , we will in the following make a more intuitive explanation on the beat - coupling effect within the framework of the halo model approach . in the halo model picture ,",
    "the mass density fluctuation field of a given wavevector @xmath91 is expressed as the sum of the mass fluctuations in the highly nonlinear regime , confined within one halo , and the mass fluctuations in the weakly nonlinear regime arising from the halo distribution , which we here refer as to the 1-halo term , @xmath336 , and the perturbation theory contribution , @xmath337 , respectively : @xmath338 in the presence of the fundamental mode uncertainty the mass fluctuations in the weakly nonlinear regime contain contributions of physical correlations between the modes of @xmath91 and @xmath86 arising from nonlinearities of gravitational clustering .",
    "more precisely , based on the perturbation theory , the density fluctuation field @xmath339 can be expanded as @xmath340 where @xmath341 , @xmath342 and @xmath343 are the linear- , 2nd- and 3rd - order contributions of the mass fluctuations in the perturbative expansion ( e.g. , see jain & bertschinger 1994 ) , and in the second equality on the r.h.s .",
    "of the equation above we have used that the linear - order fluctuations are only slowly varying with wavenumbers for a cdm model , @xmath344 .",
    "thus gravitational instability that does nt have any characteristic scale predicts that all the fluctuations of different scales are coupled to each other .",
    "in particular , the 2nd - order density fluctuations are found to contain contributions arising from the correlations between the fluctuations of @xmath345 and the fundamental mode : @xmath346 when @xmath347 .",
    "such contributions to the power spectrum covariance indeed arise after taking the ensemble average such as @xmath348 in the covariance calculation .",
    "thus the beat - coupling contribution is caused by the physical correlation between the mass fluctuations of large- and small - distance scales as predicted by the perturbation theory of mass clustering .",
    "in other words , if there are no such correlations , e.g. in the case of the linear regime , the power spectrum measured from a finite survey is not influenced by the fundamental mode uncertainty .    on the other hand ,",
    "the highly nonlinear mass fluctuations are unlikely to be affected by the fundamental mode uncertainty as follows .",
    "since the mass fluctuations in the highly nonlinear regime are very likely to lie inside a halo , the self - gravitating bound object , the mass distribution within the halo would be sufficiently decoupled from and unaffected by large - scale fluctuations , for example as in the stable clustering ansatz where the highly nonlinear fluctuations are assumed to be totally decoupled from the hubble flow .",
    "therefore the 1-halo trispectrum contribution to the power spectrum covariance is unlikely to be contaminated by the beat - coupling effect .",
    "note that , although the 1-halo term also depends on the halo mass function in addition to the mass distribution inside a halo , the mass function can be mapped out from the _ linear - order _ mass fluctuations to zero - th order approximation , as done in the press - schechter prescription , and therefore would not be affected by the fundamental mode uncertainty according to the rationale discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "= 10.cm    in this appendix , as one check of our model , we will show the comparison of our predictions with the sdss angular galaxy power spectrum recently measured in lee & pen ( 2008 ) .",
    "the formulation we have developed in this paper is readily applied to the angular power spectrum of mass clustering if the redshift weight function for lensing , @xmath26 ( e.g. see eqn .  [ [ eqn : ps ] ] ) , is replaced with the selection function of a given galaxy survey as @xmath349 where @xmath350 is the selection function : @xmath350 is unity if @xmath265 is in the range of redshifts surveyed , otherwise zero .",
    "note that the selection function should be normalized so as to satisfy @xmath351 .",

    "( [ eqn : snps1 ] ) becomes equivalent to the fisher information content @xmath356 studied in lee & pen , where the shot noise contamination due to discrete galaxy distribution is subtracted .",
    "it should be also worth noting that the galaxy bias uncertainty may not so largely change our results for mass power spectrum , as the bias factor to some extent cancels out in the @xmath355 evaluation .",
    "for the linear bias case , the @xmath355 s for mass and galaxy distribution are exactly equivalent as @xmath357 and @xmath358^{-1}=b^{-4 } [ { \\rm cov}(p_\\delta)]^{-1 } $ ] .",

    "several interesting points can be found from this plot .",
    "first , the beat - coupling effect appears to be more significant for this angular power spectrum than the lensing spectrum , because the angular power spectrum has a much narrower redshift coverage , i.e. less line - of - sight projection .",
    "more precisely , since the comoving angular diameter distance to @xmath360 is @xmath361mpc for our fiducial cosmology , the translinear regime of @xmath362$]mpc@xmath133 , where the beat - coupling is expected to be significant ( rimes & hamilton 2005 ) , appears over a wider range of multipoles @xmath363 $ ] .",
    "for the lensing case , the translinear regime signature is smeared out by the projection over a wider range of redshifts .",
    "second , very encouragingly , our model predictions fairly well reproduce the measurement results . on the other hand , the dot - dashed curve show the the result obtained assuming the nonlinear beat - coupling effect .",
    "this prediction underestimates the measurement by a factor of 3 on @xmath364 , implying an overestimation of the beat - coupling effect in this prescription .",
    "= 18.cm      the shot noise of intrinsic ellipticities contributes only to the diagonal terms of the power spectrum covariances . hence switching off the shot noise terms in the covariances",
    ", corresponding to the case of an infinite number density of source galaxies , enhances the effect of non - gaussian errors on the @xmath168 , which is studied in the left panel of figure  [ fig : sn_sig8 ] .",
    "note that , in this case , the @xmath168 value for the gaussian error case scales with @xmath171 as @xmath365 .",
    "compared to figure  [ fig : sn_lmax ] , the @xmath168 values are significantly boosted , e.g. by an order of magnitude on @xmath366 for the gaussian error case . comparing the lower panels of this plot and figure  [ fig : sn_lmax ] also manifests that non - gaussian errors more degrades the @xmath168 when the shot noise is ignored .",
    "hence , the shot noise is found to not only significantly reduce the total @xmath168 at @xmath367 , but also mitigate the impact of the non - gaussian errors .",
    "the middle pane shows similar results to figure  [ fig : sn_zm ] , but for different choices of @xmath171 ; @xmath368 , 3000 and @xmath183 , respectively .",
    "the impact of the non - gaussian errors appears to be very similar for these @xmath171 .",
    "the lensing signals as well as the non - gaussian errors are both sensitive to strengths of nonlinear mass clustering that is characterized by @xmath187 .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : sn_sig8 ] shows how the @xmath168 varies with @xmath187 assumed , but other parameters being fixed .",
    "note that our fiducial model has @xmath246 . for the gaussian error cases , the @xmath168 amplitudes increase with increasing @xmath187 as expected , due to the reduced shot noise in relative by the enhanced lensing signals . for the non - gaussian",
    "error cases , however , the @xmath168 amplitudes are more degraded with increasing @xmath187 due to stronger nonlinearities of mass clustering , as explicitly demonstrated in the lower panel .",
    "an even more interesting is , over a range of multipoles @xmath369 , the total @xmath168 amplitudes decrease with @xmath370 due to stronger effects of the non - gaussian errors .",
    "thus this modestly large dependence of the non - gaussian covariances on @xmath187 would need to be realized , if the covariances are calibrated based on simulations assuming some @xmath187 that is different from the true cosmology .",
    "for example , semboloni et al . ( 2007 ) studied the non - gaussian covariances for the real - space cosmic shear correlation function using simulations with @xmath371 , so the non - gaussian effect may be overestimated if the universe has a smaller @xmath187 such as @xmath372 ."

    "<S> the weak lensing power spectrum carries cosmological information via its dependence on the growth of structure and on geometric factors . </S>",
    "<S> since much of the cosmological information comes from scales affected by nonlinear clustering , measurements of the lensing power spectrum can be degraded by non - gaussian covariances . </S>",
    "<S> recently there have been conflicting studies about the level of this degradation . </S>",
    "<S> we use the halo model to estimate it and include new contributions related to the finite size of lensing surveys , following rimes and hamilton s study of 3d simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that non - gaussian correlations between different multipoles can degrade the cumulative signal - to - noise for the power spectrum amplitude by up to a factor of 2 ( or 5 for a worst - case model that exceeds current n - body simulation predictions ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , using an eight - parameter fisher analysis we find that the marginalized errors on individual parameters are degraded by less than @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 for the worst - case model ) . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller degradation in parameter accuracy is primarily because : individual parameters in a high - dimensional parameter space are degraded much less than the volume of the full fisher ellipsoid ; lensing involves projections along the line of sight , which reduce the non - gaussian effect ; some of the cosmological information comes from geometric factors which are not degraded at all . </S>",
    "<S> we contrast our findings with those of lee & pen ( 2008 ) who suggested a much larger degradation in information content . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our results give a useful guide for exploring survey design by giving the cosmological information returns for varying survey area , depth and the level of some systematic errors .    </S>",
