    "following his development of special relativity , einstein was faced with two immediate problems .",
    "the first was to make newtonian gravity compatible with relativity , and the second was to develop a formalism in which not only uniformly moving observers but also accelerating ones would all be able to agree on the same physics .",
    "while these two issues are logically independent ( even in the absence of gravity one has to able to write newton s second law of motion in an observer - independent way ) , by imposing general coordinate invariance and by identifying the spacetime metric @xmath1 as the gravitational field , einstein was able to provide a solution to both problems simultaneously . in this formalism",
    "a central role is played by the christoffel symbols @xmath2 , \\label{m!}\\ ] ] since in terms of them one can show that the path that minimizes the distance @xmath3 between two points in any geometry ( curved or flat ) is the one that obeys the geodesic equation @xmath4 the key feature of this equation is that even though neither of the two terms that appears in ( [ m3 ] ) is itself a true coordinate vector , the linear combination of them is , with the vanishing of their sum in any given coordinate system ensuring its vanishing in any other .    even though the christoffel symbols are not themselves true coordinate tensors , from them one can construct a quantity that is , viz .",
    "the riemann tensor as defined by @xmath5 the utility of this tensor is that a given spacetime will be flat if and only if every component of @xmath6 is zero .",
    "when all components of @xmath6 are zero , ( [ m3 ] ) describes newton s second law of motion for a free particle in the absence of gravity as viewed in an accelerating coordinate system . and",
    "when @xmath6 is non - zero , there is a choice of values for the christoffel symbols ( viz .",
    "the schwarzschild metric ones that are associated with the vanishing of the ricci tensor @xmath7 ) that enables ( [ m3 ] ) to describe newton s law of gravity , again in an arbitrary accelerating coordinate system . then , with the schwarzschild metric also giving relativistic corrections to newtonian gravity , the observation of the predicted gravitational bending of light by the sun established the validity of the above description of nature .",
    "one can thus say with confidence that gravity is a covariant metric theory in which the metric describes the gravitational field , and that the geometry in the vicinity of the sun is given by the schwarzschild metric @xmath8 where @xmath9 up to the perturbative order to which the metric has so far actually been tested .",
    "thus any viable theory of gravity must embody all of the above , and we note that in the above we have not specified the equation of motion that is to be obeyed by the gravitational field .",
    "rather , we have indicated only what its solution on solar system distance scales needs to look like .",
    "to complete the theory one thus needs to specify the gravitational field equations themselves . to",
    "this end einstein postulated that the needed equations are to be of the form @xmath10 a set of equations that can be obtained via functional variation with respect to the metric of an action for the universe of the form @xmath11 in ( [ m7 ] ) and ( [ m8 ] ) @xmath12 denotes the matter field sector and @xmath13 is the matter field energy - momentum tensor",
    ". given ( [ m7 ] ) , we immediately see that in the source - free region where @xmath14 the ricci tensor has to vanish , with the solution given in ( [ m5 ] ) and ( [ m6 ] ) then following in the region exterior to a static , spherically symmetric source .    however , while ( [ m5 ] ) and ( [ m6 ] ) follow from ( [ m7 ] ) , this is not the only way to secure the ricci - flat schwarzschild solution .",
    "consider for example an action for the universe of the conformal form @xmath15 + i_{\\rm m } , \\label{m9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 \\nonumber\\\\ & -&{1 \\over 2}\\left [ g_{\\lambda\\nu}r_{\\mu\\kappa } -g_{\\lambda\\kappa}r_{\\mu\\nu } -g_{\\mu\\nu}r_{\\lambda\\kappa } + g_{\\mu\\kappa}r_{\\lambda\\nu}\\right ] \\label{m10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the weyl conformal tensor .",
    "functional variation of this action with respect to the metric leads to the equation of motion ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 to thus yield a gravitational theory that also has @xmath19 as a vacuum solution .",
    "is constructed as the functional variation with respect to the metric of a gravitational action that is both general coordinate invariant and locally conformal invariant , it kinematically obeys @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "likewise a matter energy momentum tensor constructed as the functional variation with respect to the metric of a matter action that is general coordinate and locally conformal invariant will obey @xmath22 , @xmath23 . while the tracelessness of @xmath24 forbids the matter fields from having kinematical or mechanical masses",
    ", it is important to note @xcite that it it does not prevent them from acquiring dynamical masses via spontaneous symmetry breaking . specifically , as for instance seen explicitly in sec .",
    "( 7 ) below , the scalar order parameter @xmath25 that gives a fermionic matter field a mass also carries energy density and momentum that serve to maintain @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , since in flat space it does this by adding a cosmological constant term @xmath26 on to the standard kinematic perfect fluid @xmath27 ( see e.g. ( [ m45 ] ) below and @xcite ) , it does not affect energy differences or the conservation of @xmath27 .",
    "in flat space @xmath26 is not observable , and one can use the non - traceless @xmath27 to describe macroscopic systems .",
    "it is only in its coupling to gravity that presence of @xmath26 can be felt .",
    "] this analysis thus shows that the einstein equations given in ( [ m7 ] ) are only sufficient to give the schwarzschild solution and its non - relativistic newtonian limit but not necessary .",
    "the einstein equations are thus not uniquely selected .",
    "moreover , in and of itself , the requirement that the gravitational action be a general coordinate scalar does not at all restrict the gravitational sector of the action to be of the einstein - hilbert @xmath28 form given in ( [ m8 ] ) , with the number of possible general coordinate invariant gravitational actions that one could write down actually being infinite , since one could use arbitrarily high powers of the riemann tensor and its contractions . this lack of uniqueness is familiarly reflected in the fact that one is free to augment ( [ m8 ] ) with a term of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the cosmological constant .    beyond this",
    "we note that if one takes ( [ m7 ] ) as a given and extrapolates it beyond its weak classical gravity solar system origins , one runs into difficulties in essentially every type of extrapolation that one could consider .",
    "thus if one extrapolates the classical theory to galaxies and clusters of galaxies one runs into the dark matter problem , if one extrapolates the classical theory to cosmology one runs into the cosmological constant or dark energy problem , if one extrapolates to strong classical gravity one runs into the singularity problem , and if one quantizes the theory and extrapolates far off the mass shell one runs into the renormalizability and zero - point problems .",
    "now even though no dark matter has yet been detected and dark energy is not yet at all understood , if one nonetheless takes dark matter and dark energy as a given , one then encounters many successes as well ( such as big bang nucleosynthesis , anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background , strong lensing ) .",
    "however , to achieve these successes one has to take the energy budget of the universe to be of order 70% dark energy and 25% dark matter , with only 5% or so being regular luminous baryonic matter . not only is there as yet no detection of the needed dark matter particles , the required amount of dark energy is 60 orders of magnitude or so less than the amount expected from fundamental elementary particle physics  and if one were to use the large particle physics value the fits would be disastrous .",
    "moreover , with all applications to date of gravity to astrophysics and cosmology having been made with gravity itself being treated classically , there is no guarantee that the current successes of standard einstein gravity would not be modified by its non - renormalizable quantum corrections . given these concerns",
    "we shall thus look for a completely different extrapolation of solar system wisdom , in a theory that is unambiguously specified .",
    "as we shall see , via the imposition of a particular invariance principle , namely local conformal invariance , none of the above extrapolation problems or ambiguities will any longer be encountered .",
    "to see how things work , we note that if we start with the kinetic energy of a free massless fermion in flat spacetime , then in order to obtain an action that is locally gauge invariant under @xmath31 ( we suppress internal symmetry group indices ) , we introduce a gauge field that transforms as @xmath32 , and minimally couple according to @xmath33\\psi(x ) .",
    "\\label{m13}\\ ] ] similarly , if we start with the kinetic energy of a free massless fermion in flat spacetime , in order to obtain an action that is locally coordinate invariant , we introduce the fermion spin connection @xmath34 , with the action taking the form @xmath35\\psi(x ) , \\label{m14}\\ ] ] with @xmath36 and @xmath37-[\\gamma^{\\nu}(x),\\gamma_{\\sigma}(x)]\\gamma^{\\sigma}_{\\mu\\nu})/8 $ ] , and with @xmath38 being a vierbein and the four @xmath39 being the special - relativistic dirac gamma matrices .",
    "having now obtained ( [ m14 ] ) this way , we find that without having required it explicitly , this action actually has an additional symmetry , as it is locally conformal invariant under @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "consequently , we can regard the spin connection @xmath34 as being introduced not to maintain local coordinate invariance but rather to maintain local conformal invariance instead , in exactly the same minimally - coupled way that @xmath43 maintains local gauge invariance .",
    "thus if we require that the kinetic energy of a massless fermion be invariant under complex phase transformations of the form @xmath44 , we will be led to an action @xmath45\\psi(x ) \\label{m15}\\ ] ] that is locally gauge invariant and locally conformal invariant combined .",
    "( under a local gauge transformation the metric transforms as @xmath46 , while under a local conformal transformation the gauge field transforms as @xmath47 . )",
    "the reason why such a local conformal structure emerges in ( [ m14 ] ) is that massless particles move on the light cone , and the light cone is not just poincare invariant , it is invariant under the full 15-parameter conformal group @xmath48 .",
    "( if the @xmath49 line element is zero , then so is @xmath50 . )",
    "moreover , the covering group of @xmath48 is @xmath51 .",
    "since @xmath51 is generated by the 15 dirac matrices ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 $ ] ) , its fundamental representation is a fermionic field , and the full conformal structure of the light cone is thus built into a massless fermionic field , with a 4-component dirac spinor being irreducible under the conformal group even as it is reducible under poincare .    as we see",
    ", it is thus natural to take fermions to be the most basic elements in physics , with internal symmetry gauge fields and a gravitational spin connection being induced once one gives the fermion kinetic energy a local complex phase invariance . however , such a starting point does not generate any kinetic energy terms for the gauge and gravitational fields . to actually generate them rather than just postulate them we take note of a calculation by t hooft @xcite .",
    "specifically , t hooft evaluated the logarithmically divergent part of the path integral @xmath56 associated with ( [ m15 ] ) , and found that after dimensional regularization it took the form of an effective action : @xmath57 + \\frac{1}{3}f_{\\mu\\nu}f^{\\mu\\nu}\\right ] , \\label{m16}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 in spacetime dimension @xmath59 . comparing with ( [ m9 ] )",
    "we see that we have generated none other than the conformal gravity action @xmath60 ( as then rewritten using the gauss - bonnet theorem ) together with the maxwell action , and take note of the fact that this procedure did not generate the einstein - hilbert action . with the maxwell action being invariant under @xmath32 and with the conformal gravity action being invariant under @xmath42 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the conformal gravity action thus serves as the gravitational analog of the maxwell action , and in the following we shall thus use local conformal invariance as the principle with which to fix the structure of the gravitational action . in so",
    "doing we see that gravity can be generated by gauging the full conformal symmetry of the light cone .",
    "given the assumption of local conformal invariance , we find that the conformal gravity action @xmath61 is the unique gravitational action that is invariant under the local transformation @xmath42 , with the gravitational coupling constant @xmath62 being dimensionless .",
    "because the coupling constant @xmath62 is dimensionless , the conformal theory is power - counting renormalizable , and thus if we did not include an initial @xmath60 term in the action , we would anyway generate one as a renormalization counter - term . because the variation of the conformal action leads to fourth - order equations of motion",
    ", it had long been thought that the theory would not be unitary .",
    "however , as we describe in sec .",
    "( [ s5 ] ) , bender and mannheim @xcite have recently shown that one can find a realization of the theory that is unitary .",
    "consequently , conformal gravity is to be regarded as a bona fide quantum gravitational theory .",
    "moreover , the similarity of the theory to maxwell theory also carries over to the generation of a macroscopic classical limit starting from a microscopic quantum field theory .",
    "specifically , in just the same way as the classical maxwell equations emerge from the quantum maxwell equations as matrix elements of the quantum fields in states containing an indefinite number of photons , because of its renormalizability the same will happen for conformal gravity in states containing an indefinite number of gravitational quanta , with both the quantum theory and its macroscopic classical limit obeying the equation of motion given in ( [ m11 ] ) .",
    "consequently , in the following we will be able to use ( [ m11 ] ) to study both the microscopic zero - point fluctuation problem and the macroscopic behavior of the theory on astrophysical distance scales .    the non - renormalizable einstein - hilbert action is expressly forbidden by the conformal symmetry because newton s constant carries an intrinsic dimension .",
    "however , as noted above , this does not prevent the theory from possessing the schwarzschild solution and newton s law of gravity .",
    "in addition , the same conformal symmetry forbids the presence of any intrinsic cosmological constant term as it carries an intrinsic dimension too ; with conformal invariance thus providing a very good starting point for tackling the cosmological constant problem .",
    "now we recall that the fermion and gauge boson sector of the standard @xmath63 model of strong , electromagnetic , and weak interactions is also locally conformal invariant since all the associated coupling constants are dimensionless , and gauge bosons and fermions get masses dynamically via spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "other than the higgs sector ( which we shall shortly dispense with ) , the standard model lagrangian is devoid of any intrinsic mass or length scales . and with its associated energy - momentum tensor serving as the source of gravity , it is thus quite natural that gravity should be devoid of any intrinsic mass or length scales too .",
    "our use of conformal gravity thus nicely dovetails with the standard @xmath63 model . to tighten the connection",
    ", we note that while the standard @xmath63 model is based on second - order equations of motion , an electrodynamics lagrangian of the form @xmath64 would be just as gauge and lorentz invariant as the maxwell action , and there is no immediate reason to leave any such type of term out .",
    "now while an @xmath64 theory would not be renormalizable , in and of itself renormalizability is not a law of nature ( witness einstein gravity ) .",
    "however , such a theory would not be conformal invariant .",
    "thus if we impose local conformal invariance as a principle , we would then force the fundamental gauge theories to be second order , and thus be renormalizable after all . however , imposing the same symmetry on gravity expressly forces it to be fourth order instead , with gravity then also being renormalizable . as we see , renormalizability is thus a consequence of conformal invariance .",
    "now if the underlying theory is to be locally conformal invariant , there would be no place for a fundamental higgs field with its tachyonic double - well potential . instead , mass scales would have to be generated dynamically in the vacuum via dynamical fermion bilinear condensates .",
    "the elimination of a fundamental higgs field has an immediate benefit ",
    "one no longer has to deal with the uncontrollable cosmological constant contribution it produces when it acquires a non - vanishing expectation value .",
    "however , one still has to make contact with the standard model , and one would thus want to obtain a standard model lagrangian with some effective scalar field . such an effective scalar field would have to emerge as a ginzburg - landau c - number order parameter , i.e. as the matrix element of a fermion bilinear operator in some possibly spacetime - dependent coherent state",
    ". such an effective c - number scalar field would not be observable in an accelerator .",
    "to see what such an effective theory might look like , we note that if the fermion acquires a mass parameter @xmath65 by some dynamical symmetry breaking mechanism , the associated hartree - fock mean - field action would take the same form as given in ( [ m15 ] ) , only with a mass term added , viz .",
    "@xmath66\\psi(x ) . \\label{m17}\\ ] ] evaluating the logarithmically divergent part of the same @xmath56 path integral as before only with ( [ m17 ] ) this time generates the same @xmath67 as in ( [ m16 ] ) , while adding on the mean - field action @xcite ( as written here using the sign convention employed in this paper for @xmath68 ) : @xmath69 . \\label{m18}\\ ] ] here @xmath70 is the same logarithmically divergent constant as before . finally , if we give @xmath65 a group index , the same procedure would cause the @xmath71 terms to be replaced by covariant gauge derivatives ( see @xcite ) , and would yield @xmath72}. \\label{m19}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when ( [ m19 ] ) is taken in conjunction with ( [ m16 ] ) , a conformally coupled standard model emerges , but with a c - number scalar parameter @xmath65 that is not a fundamental field . in secs .",
    "( [ s7 ] ) and ( [ s8 ] ) we will show how such a mass parameter @xmath65 could be generated as a fermion bilinear condensate in a conformal invariant theory . and",
    "in @xcite we explore the degree to which the existence of such a c - number order parameter @xmath65 necessitates the existence of an accompanying dynamical bound state scalar particle .",
    "in trying to find solutions to the conformal theory , we note that given the lack of any intrinsic mass or length scales in the conformal action , without dynamical generation of such scales there could be no non - trivial solutions to the theory .",
    "thus if all mass and length scales are to come from dynamics , and all such mass - generating dynamics is to be quantum - mechanical ( c.f .",
    "no fundamental higgs fields ) , the only allowed geometry in purely classical conformal gravity would be one with no curvature at all , viz . a geometry that is minkowski .",
    "( for there to be any curvature one needs some length scale to characterize it . )",
    "thus if one takes @xmath73 to be a classical fourth - order derivative function , then even though one could readily find an exterior vacuum solution to @xmath74 such as the ricci - flat one given in ( [ m5 ] ) and ( [ m6 ] ) , there would be no basis for taking the dimensionful parameter @xmath75 to be non - zero since the theory is as yet scale free .",
    "for the solution to a differential equation to have lower symmetry than the equation itself it ( i.e. for a solution to contain symmetry - breaking integration constants that are not present in the equation itself ) , there has to be a spontaneous breakdown of the symmetry .",
    "if all symmetry breaking is to be quantum - mechanical , then in the absence of quantum mechanics , geometry would have to be flat .",
    "thus , if the mass that appears in the schwarzschild radius of a source is quantum - mechanically generated , then the curvature produced by that mass is ipso facto due to quantum mechanics too .",
    "the above remarks require some clarification since in classical electrodynamics one can construct plane wave solutions with @xmath76 even though the classical maxwell equations are conformal invariant .",
    "specifically , if we have a free classical maxwell action @xmath77 in flat spacetime , the associated homogeneous wave equation takes the form @xmath78 ( in the convenient lorentz gauge ) .",
    "however , while this equation has @xmath79 as a solution , this solution involves a dimensionful four - vector momentum @xmath80 that is not present in the equation of motion itself .",
    "hence some mechanism is required to generate such a four - momentum . in classical maxwell theory",
    "the mechanism for doing this is not from the @xmath81 sector of the theory at all , but rather via the introduction of a localized source @xmath82 . in the presence of the source the solution to the inhomogeneous @xmath83",
    "is given as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the massless retarded propagator .",
    "now @xmath86 itself is written entirely in terms of the spacetime coordinates and contains no fundamental scales .",
    "rather , the scales reside in the localized @xmath82 , and if it for instance oscillates with a specific frequency , then the resulting @xmath43 will oscillate with that same frequency too",
    ". however , for @xmath82 to be localized and possess such an oscillation frequency , it would not be scale invariant .",
    "hence the classical maxwell field only possesses frequency scales because the sources to which it couples are taken to possess them , and the sources themselves can only possess such scales if they are not scale invariant .",
    "however , if all the particles contained in electromagnetic sources are to acquire length scales quantum - mechanically , then there could be no fundamental classical electromagnetic sources that could possess such length scales in the first place .",
    "classical electromagnetism with localized oscillating sources is thus a macroscopic manifestation of an underlying microscopic quantum maxwell theory in which scales are generated dynamically . in a truly scale - free classical electrodynamics",
    "there could not be any electromagnetic waves .",
    "thus just like gravity , the same conformal invariance will not permit electromagnetic sources to have any nontrivial intrinsically classical component either , with such sources being intrinsically quantum - mechanical .",
    "if momentum modes are not to arise in classical physics , one needs to ask how it is that they then do arise . to this end",
    "we note that as well as generating mass scales via dynamics , there is another way in which quantum mechanics produces scales , namely via the quantization procedure itself .",
    "specifically , scales are introduced via canonical commutation relations , with the generic equal - time commutation relation @xmath87=i\\hbar \\delta^3(\\bar{x}-\\bar{x}^{\\prime})$ ] for instance being a non - linear relation that introduces a scale @xmath88 everywhere on a spacelike hypersurface .",
    "since we can set @xmath89 , this is equivalent to introducing a complete basis of momentum modes , with momentum modes thus being intrinsically quantum mechanical .",
    "and indeed it is the very existence of this set of modes that gives rise to the zero - point energy density and pressure of a quantized field that we discuss in the following .",
    "moreover , a quantized field will have a zero - point energy density and pressure even when it is massless , i.e. even in the absence of mass generation .",
    "then , when there is mass generation , the momentum modes will obey the @xmath90 mass condition and cause the massless theory zero - point energy density and pressure to readjust . and",
    "as we show in secs .",
    "( [ s7 ] ) and ( [ s8 ] ) , this readjustment will cancel the cosmological constant that is induced by the same mass generation mechanism .",
    "given the above remarks , we see that in conformal gravity we should expand the metric as a power series in planck s constant rather than as a power series in the gravitational coupling constant , with the zeroth - order term in the expansion being flat . consequently , in the theory there is no intrinsic classical gravity , with the equations that are to be used for macroscopic systems being associated with matrix elements of the quantum fields in states with an indefinite number of gravitational quanta , since there is to be no intrinsic classical gravity , there could not be any classical black holes . while conformal gravity thus eliminates the classical gravity singularity problem , and",
    "thus simultaneously eliminates the need to have to make such classical singularities compatible with quantum mechanics , it remains to be seen whether the theory might still generate geometric singularities through quantum - mechanical effects , though one might anticipate that the uncertainty principle might spread sources out enough to prevent this from happening .",
    "even with the requirement that the metric be expanded as a power series in planck s constant , quantization of gravity can still not follow the standard canonical quantization prescription that is used for other fields .",
    "specifically , for a matter field one obtains its equation of motion by varying the matter action with respect to the matter field , but one obtains its energy - momentum tensor @xmath91 by instead varying the matter action with respect to the metric . since @xmath91 involves products of matter fields at the same point , a canonical quantization of the matter field then gives the matter energy - momentum tensor a non - vanishing zero - point contribution .",
    "however , in a standard quantization procedure for a given matter field , the non - vanishing of @xmath91 violates no constraint since one does not simultaneously impose the equation of motion of any other field .",
    "thus for a given matter field one does not require stationarity with respect to the metric , with @xmath91 thus not being constrained to vanish .",
    "in contrast however , for gravity the relevant field is the metric itself .",
    "if we define the variation of the gravitational action with respect to the metric to be a quantity @xmath92 , the gravitational equation of motion is then given by @xmath93 .",
    "according to @xmath94 , the first - order term in @xmath95 gives the wave equation obeyed by @xmath95 , while the term that is quadratic in @xmath95 is both covariantly conserved with respect to the background metric and gives the energy density carried by a gravity wave . in sec .",
    "( 6 ) below we provide an equivalent analysis in the conformal case . ] then , with @xmath92 containing products of fields at the same point , a canonical quantization of the gravitational field would give a zero - point contribution to @xmath92 , and thus violate the stationarity condition @xmath93 that @xmath92 has to obey .",
    "hence , unlike the matter fields for which there is no constraint on @xmath91 in the absence of any coupling of matter to gravity , gravity itself is always coupled to gravity , with its stationarity condition not permitting it to consistently be quantized on its own .    despite this",
    ", we note that if we impose a stationarity condition with respect to the metric not on the gravity piece or the matter piece alone , but on their sum as given by the total @xmath96 of the universe introduced in ( [ m9 ] ) , we then obtain @xmath97 in this case it now is possible to quantize gravity consistently , with @xmath98 now being able to be non - zero provided gravity is coupled to some quantized matter field source for which @xmath13 is non - zero .",
    "thus gravity can only be quantized consistently if it is coupled to a quantized matter field .",
    "however , in order for the cancellation required of the total @xmath99 to actually take place , the quantization condition imposed on the gravitational sector commutation relations would have to be fixed by the quantization condition in the matter sector in order to enforce @xmath100 , with each term being intrinsically quantum - mechanical .",
    "consequently , gravity is not only quantized though its coupling to quantized matter , its commutation relations are explicitly determined by that coupling , with gravity needing no independent quantization of its own . finally , we note that not only do the matter fields quantize gravity , the vanishing of @xmath99 entails that the gravity field and the matter field zero - point fluctuations must cancel each other identically . in secs .",
    "( [ s6 ] ) , ( [ s7 ] ) and ( [ s8 ] ) we explore this point in detail .",
    "when the @xmath73 tensor given in ( [ m12 ] ) is linearized around a flat spacetime background with metric @xmath101 according to @xmath102 , it is found @xcite to be a function of the traceless quantity @xmath103 . in the convenient transverse gauge @xmath104 , the first order term in @xmath73",
    "is found to take the simple form @xmath105 while the second order term in the conformal action @xmath106 given in ( [ m9 ] ) takes the form @xmath107 since there is no mixing of components of @xmath108 in either ( [ m21 ] ) or ( [ m22 ] ) , one can explore the unitarity structure of the theory by working with an analog one - component scalar field theory . as such",
    ", the condition @xmath109 is one of a broad class of fourth - order equations of motion that have been encountered in the literature , and all of them can be associated with the generic scalar action @xmath110 .",

    ", one finds that some of the poles have the negative residues that occur in an indefinite metric hilbert space . to avoid such negative residues , one can find @xcite an alternate contour in which the residues of all poles are positive but in which some of the negative energy modes propagate forward in time . while one can quantize this realization with a standard dirac norm ,",
    "as the presence of the @xmath117 term in @xmath118 indicates , in this case the energy eigenvalue spectrum is unbounded from below .    with neither of these two possibilities being palatable , higher - derivative theories",
    "have long been regarded as being unphysical .",
    "however , recently bender and mannheim revisited the issue @xcite and found a third realization of the theory in which the energy spectrum is bounded from below and there are no negative hilbert space norms at all .",
    "with the appropriate scalar product for a hilbert space being determined by boundary conditions , to determine the relevant scalar product one needs some asymptotic information . to this end bender and",
    "mannheim studied the eigenvalue problem for the hamiltonian @xmath119 in the sector of the theory where the energy eigenvalue spectrum is bounded from below , and found that the associated wave functions were not normalizable on the real axis . in consequence of this ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the system could not be hermitian .",
    "however , the wave functions were found to be normalizable on the imaginary axis , and thus the field @xmath120 would have to be anti - hermitian rather than hermitian , with the @xmath117 term in @xmath118 then being bounded from below .",
    "in addition they noted that if they constructed a path integral for the system , it would not exist with real @xmath120 but would be well - defined if @xmath120 were pure imaginary .",
    "so again , one needs to take @xmath120 to be an anti - hermitian operator .",
    "now if a hamiltonian is not hermitian , one is immediately concerned that its eigenvalues might not all be real .",
    "however , while hermiticity implies reality of eigenvalues , there is no converse theorem that says that a non - hermitian hamiltonian must have complex eigenvalues .",
    "consequently , hermiticity is only sufficient for reality but not necessary .",
    "recently , as part of the general @xmath0 symmetry program that has been developed by bender and collaborators @xcite a necessary condition for reality has been found , namely that a hamiltonian have a @xmath0 symmetry where @xmath121 is a linear operator and @xmath122 is an antilinear one .",
    "specifically , it was shown in @xcite that if a hamiltonian is @xmath0 invariant the secular equation @xmath123 that determines the eigenvalues is real .",
    "then in @xcite the converse was shown , namely that if the secular equation is real , the hamiltonian must have a @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "consequently , the energy eigenspectrum of a hamiltonian that is not @xmath0 symmetric must contain some complex eigenvalues .",
    "noting now that all the poles in the propagator given in ( [ m25 ] ) lie on the real axis , we see that the hamiltonian for the fourth - order theory while not hermitian must instead be @xmath0 symmetric . for",
    "such hamiltonians one can construct a norm , the so - called @xmath124 norm of @xmath0 theories @xcite , that obeys unitary time evolution . for our purposes here we note that for a non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath125 that has a completely real energy eigenspectrum , @xmath125 and @xmath126 must be related by a similarity transform of the form @xmath127 thus if @xmath125 has a right - eigenvector according to @xmath128 with real @xmath129 , its conjugate will obey @xmath130 and will not be a left - eigenvector of @xmath125 . rather , the state @xmath131 defined as @xmath132 will be a left - eigenvector of @xmath125 since it obeys @xmath133 in this case it will be the norm @xmath134 that will obey unitary time evolution since it evolves as @xmath135 thus we see that the needed scalar product is the overlap of a left - eigenvector with a right - eigenvector and not the overlap of a right - eigenvector with its own conjugate .",
    "moreover , in @xcite it was shown that the existence of a @xmath136 that can connect @xmath125 and @xmath126 according to @xmath137 is a necessary and sufficient condition for both the existence of a @xmath0 symmetry and for the existence of a unitary scalar product , with the scalar product then being of the form @xmath134 .",
    "the existence of a @xmath0 invariance for a hamiltonian is thus a necessary and sufficient condition for unitary time evolution .",
    "when these @xmath0 ideas are applied to the fourth - order propagator , it is found @xcite that the relative minus in it is no longer associated with an indefinite metric at all .",
    "rather , it is associated with @xmath136 operator , with the completeness relation being given by @xmath138 and not by the negative norm @xmath139 .",
    "finally , the propagator itself is found to be given by the green s function @xmath140 rather than by the familiar @xmath141 . as we see , the unitarity problem for fourth - order propagators only arose because one wanted to represent them as @xmath141 .",
    "once one recognizes that the left vacuum need not be the conjugate of the right vacuum unitarity can then readily be achieved .",
    "now while the above discussion was developed for the general second- plus fourth - order action given in ( [ m23 ] ) , for the conformal case given in ( [ m21 ] ) we are interested in a pure fourth - order theory alone where the propagator is given by @xmath142 ( a propagator whose poles again are all on the real axis ) . since the reduction to a pure fourth - order theory would require setting both @xmath143 and @xmath144 equal to zero in ( [ m23 ] ) , we see that because of the @xmath145 prefactor in ( [ m25 ] ) , the limit is singular . in consequence ,",
    "the limit is a quite unusual one in which the hamiltonian becomes a non - diagonalizable , jordan - block hamiltonian @xcite , with some of the states that had been eigenstates being replaced by non - stationary ones . the very fact that the hamiltonian is not diagonalizable immediately confirms that it could not be hermitian , just as we had noted above . in this case even though the set of energy eigenstates is not complete , the set of stationary plus non - stationary states combined is complete @xcite , with time evolution of packets built out of the two classes of states combined being unitary @xcite .",
    "the unitarity of the pure fourth - order conformal gravity theory is thus established .    as we thus see",
    ", in order to establish unitarity for fourth - order theories we need the field @xmath146 , and thus @xmath1 itself , to be anti - hermitian rather than hermitian .",
    "now this is not how one ordinarily thinks about the gravitational field , since one would presuppose that it , above all fields , should have a real classical limit .",
    "nonetheless , having an anti - hermitian gravitational field is is not in conflict with anything that is actually known about gravity .",
    "specifically , in @xcite it was noted that if one replaces @xmath147 by @xmath148 ( and thus @xmath149 by @xmath150 ) neither the christoffel symbols that appear in geodesics nor @xmath151 would be affected at all . in four space - time dimensions",
    "@xmath152 would not be affected either .",
    "even though riemann tensor contractions could generate factors of i , all such factors could be absorbed by redefining the overall multiplicative coefficients in the action ( and likewise for the @xmath153 line element ) .",
    "hence , current gravitational measurements can not distinguish between a purely real or a purely imaginary gravitational field . and",
    "as we have seen , once one takes the gravitational field to be anti - hermitian , one can construct a consistent , renormalizable and unitary theory of quantum gravity . and perhaps the problems that beset quantum gravity have arisen because one wanted the gravitational field to be hermitian .",
    "in current applications of standard gravity to macroscopic astrophysical and cosmological systems , one treats gravity itself as being purely classical .",
    "however , one can not treat its matter source that way too since there are some intrinsically quantum - mechanical sources that are significant macroscopically .",
    "thus , white dwarf stars are stabilized by the pauli degeneracy pressure of the electrons in the star , and black - body radiation contributes to cosmic expansion . for white dwarfs and the stefan - boltzmann constant @xmath154 for black - body radiation both intrinsically depend on @xmath155 . both of these parameters would expressly have to appear in the macroscopic gravitational equations of motion , and for neither of them could one set @xmath155 to zero .",
    "] to couple these particular effects to classical gravity , both of them are taken to be described as ensemble averages over an appropriate set of positive - energy fock space states .",
    "however , while the fock space states would be eigenstates of a hamiltonian of the generic form @xmath156 , the infinite @xmath157 zero - point contribution is ignored , i.e. one takes the hamiltonian to be of the truncated form @xmath158 instead .",
    "now in flat space one is free to discard the zero - point term ( say by a normal ordering prescription ) since in flat space one can only measure energy differences .",
    "however the hallmark of gravity is that it couple to energy density itself and not to energy density difference , and so discarding anything to which gravity couples would require justification .",
    "since one would have to cancel infinities in the matter field energy - momentum tensor @xmath13 if the gravitational effects that occur in standard gravity are to be finite , some mechanism needs to be identified that would effect the cancellation . an immediate mechanism that might achieve",
    "this would be a cancellation between appropriately chosen matter fields , since bosons and fermions contribute to @xmath13 with opposite signs .",
    "in fact such a cancellation will occur if there is an exact supersymmetry between fermions and bosons .",
    "however , once the fermion - boson mass degeneracy is broken , the cancellation is lost . with the non - observation to date of any of the requisite superpartners ,",
    "we know that the supersymmetry breaking scale must be at least in the tev region , with the uncanceled zero - point energy then being huge .",
    "nonetheless , the generic idea of a boson - fermion cancellation as enforced by some symmetry still makes sense since fermions and bosons generate vacuum energies with opposite signs no matter what the theory . to take advantage of this ,",
    "we note that the treatment of standard gravity described above is deficient in one rather serious regard , namely it ignores the effect of quantum mechanics on gravity itself . and as soon as one quantizes gravity , gravity itself will acquire a zero - point contribution . since gravitational quanta are bosonic , under certain circumstances they may then be able to provide the needed cancellation . specifically , for such a cancellation to occur one needs three things : a quantum gravity theory that makes sense , a symmetry , and the presence of fermions in the matter field sector . with conformal gravity meeting",
    "all of these criteria ( as noted above fermions are its building blocks ) , in the following we will explore its implications for the vacuum energy problem .",
    "we will see that when the conformal symmetry is unbroken the needed cancellation does in fact occur .",
    "and then , unlike the supersymmetry situation , the cancellation will be maintained even after the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken and a cosmological constant term is induced .",
    "one of the challenges that gravity theory faces is that zero - point and cosmological constant contributions already occur for matter fields in flat spacetime , i.e. they occur in the absence of gravity .",
    "since gravity is not involved in flat space physics , it is very difficult for gravity to then resolve any problem that it is not responsible for . to enable gravity to resolve such problems we need to put the gravitational field an equal footing with the matter fields .",
    "this we can do if there are no intrinsic classical contributions in either the gravitational or the matter sectors and all physics is quantum mechanical , i.e. precisely as conformal symmetry requires . since the lowest order quantum - mechanical contribution to @xmath13 is a zero - point contribution of order @xmath155 , to cancel it through the vanishing of the total @xmath99 given in ( [ m20 ] ) , we will need the lowest non - trivial gravitational term to be of order @xmath155 too .",
    "since the zero - point contribution is due to products of fields at the same point , the order @xmath155 gravitational zero - point must involve a product of two gravitational fields and thus be given by the second - order @xmath159 ( @xmath160 ) tensor that is obtained by varying the @xmath161 term in ( [ m22 ] ) . to this order in @xmath155",
    "we only need to evaluate @xmath13 in a flat background .",
    "it will then generate an order @xmath155 curvature , with the order @xmath162 term in @xmath13 then being curvature dependent .",
    "moreover , with @xmath99 vanishing not only in lowest order but in all orders if both the gravitational and matter field sectors are renormalizable ( i.e. in a renormalizable theory ( [ m20 ] ) is an all - order identity ) , the zero - point cancellation will occur to all orders .",
    "thus if we decompose @xmath98 and @xmath13 into finite and divergent parts according to @xmath163 , @xmath164 , ( [ m20 ] ) will decompose into @xmath165 and @xmath166 with ( [ m31 ] ) we see that all gravitational and matter field infinities cancel each other identically , with @xmath167 and @xmath168 regulating each other . given this regulation ,",
    "there is no need to renormalize either of the two terms as their sum is finite , and thus no renormalization anomaly such as the conformal anomaly is generated .",
    "being due to stationarity with respect to the metric , such stationarity equally guarantees the vanishing of the trace @xmath169 without any need to impose conformal invariance .",
    "thus even though the vanishing of the individual gravity sector and matter sector traces @xmath170 and @xmath171 do require conformal invariance , and even though conformal symmetry ward identities might be violated by renormalization anomalies , the vanishing of @xmath169 can not be affected by the lack of scale invariance of regulator masses .",
    "any anomalies in @xmath172 must thus all mutually cancel each other identically . ] and with all infinities having been removed , ( [ m32 ] ) provides us with a completely finite framework for calculating gravitational effects .",
    "thus in ( [ m31 ] ) we take care of the @xmath157 type terms , and in ( [ m32 ] ) we are free to use the @xmath158 type terms alone .    with @xmath173 being of order @xmath155 , the gravitational fluctuation @xmath108 must itself be of order @xmath174 , and since the lowest non - trivial term in @xmath13 is of order @xmath155 , it must be the case that @xmath175 in ( [ m21 ] ) vanish identically . while the vanishing of @xmath175 provides us with a wave equation , the situation is not quite the same as the one that occurs when one expands in a power series in the gravitational coupling constant . specifically , in that case the first - order fluctuation term on the gravitational side is produced by a first - order fluctuation term on the matter side , so that the gravitational fluctuation would obey an inhomogeneous wave equation with a source .",
    "in contrast , in the conformal case the first - order gravitational wave equation is strictly homogeneous on all scales .",
    "then , since this equation is homogeneous , in and of itself it does not force @xmath108 to be non - zero . however , since the order @xmath155 contribution to @xmath13 is non - zero , @xmath159 can not vanish , and thus @xmath108 can not vanish either .",
    "it is thus quantization of the matter field that forces the gravitational field to be quantized , with the condition @xmath176 fixing the strength of the commutator terms present in the second order @xmath173 . with the matter field",
    "fixing the strength of the gravitational sector , the cancelation of both zero - point contributions and conformal anomalies is secured .    to see how things work in detail we consider conformal gravity coupled to a dirac fermion . to the order @xmath155 of interest to us",
    "we can take the fermion to be a free massless fermion in flat spacetime . in this case",

    "thus these two infinities obey @xmath184 .",
    "such an energy - momentum tensor could not be associated with a cosmological constant term of the form @xmath185 since its trace is given by the non - zero @xmath186 , with the cosmological constant and zero - point fluctuation problems in principle thus being different .",
    "given its @xmath187 structure , the zero - point quantity @xmath188 can be written in the form of a perfect fluid with a timelike fluid velocity vector @xmath189 , viz . @xmath190 with the fluid thus possessing both a zero - point energy density and a zero - point pressure . ) involves terms that are infinite and thus not well - defined , we note the perfect fluid form given in ( [ m34 ] ) can be established by integrating over the direction of the 3-momentum vector @xmath191 alone , an integration that is completely finite . a perfect fluid form for ( [ m33 ] )",
    "can thus be established prior to the subsequent divergent integration over the magnitude of the momentum , with this latter integration not bringing @xmath188 to the form of a cosmological constant . even though ( [ m33 ] ) is not well - defined , for our purposes here",

    "however there is a crucial difference between the two cases . for newtonian gravity one uses the second - order poisson equation @xmath326 and obtains a potential and force of the form @xmath327 as such",
    ", the import of ( [ m61 ] ) is that even though @xmath328 could continue globally all the way to infinity , the force at any radial point @xmath329 is determined solely by the material in the local @xmath330 region . in this sense newtonian gravity",
    "is local in character , since to explain a gravitational effect in some local region one only needs to consider the material in that region .",
    "thus in newtonian gravity , if one wishes to explain the behavior of galactic rotation curves through the use of dark matter , one must locate the dark matter where the problem is and not elsewhere , i.e. within the galaxies themselves .    however , this familiar property of newtonian gravity is not generic to any theory of gravity . in particular",
    "if we define @xmath331 , the conformal gravity potential associated with ( [ m56 ] ) will obey the fourth - order poisson equation @xmath332 , with general solution @xmath333 as we see , this time we do find a global contribution to the force coming from material in the @xmath334 region that is beyond the radial point of interest . hence in conformal gravity one can not ignore the rest of the universe , with a test particle in orbit in a galaxy being able to sample both the local field due to the matter in the galaxy and the global field due to the rest of the matter in the universe . unlike newtonian gravity",
    "then , conformal gravity is an intrinsically global theory .",
    "the contribution that the rest of the universe provides consists of two components , the homogeneous cosmological background and the inhomogeneities within it . the homogeneous background can be described by a roberston - walker ( rw ) geometry , while large scale inhomogeneities are typically in the form of large gravitationally bound systems such as clusters and superclusters .",
    "since the rw metric is conformal to flat , and since the weyl tensor vanishes identically in a such a geometry , the cosmological background is characterized by a geometry in which @xmath73 of ( [ m11 ] ) ( and thus the cosmological @xmath13 ) vanish identically . however , since localized inhomogeneities have a non - vanishing weyl tensor , the inhomogeneities contribute to the integrals in ( [ m62 ] ) that extend out to infinity beyond the galaxy of interest .",
    "the inhomogeneities contribute to the particular integral solution to ( [ m11 ] ) given in ( [ m62 ] ) ( both @xmath335 and @xmath336 non - zero ) , while the homogeneous background contributes to the complementary function ( both @xmath335 and @xmath336 zero ) .",
    "in order for the background cosmology to contribute non - trivially , we note that even though we need the background @xmath13 to vanish ( since the rw @xmath73 vanishes ) , we would need @xmath13 to vanish non - trivially if it is to have any content .",
    "as shown in @xcite , such a non - trivial vanishing can be achieved by an interplay between the positive contribution of the matter sources ( c.f .",
    "@xmath158 ) and the negative contribution of the gravitational field that occurs if the 3-curvature @xmath256 of the universe is negative , with gravity providing negative energy density .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that with such a cosmology one could then fit the accelerating universe hubble plot data without the need for any fine - tuning of parameters or for any of the cosmological dark matter required in the standard theory .",

    "however , as we had noted above , there is a contribution due to inhomogeneities in the cosmic background that we need to include too .",
    "these inhomogeneities would typically be clusters and superclusters and would be associated with distance scales between 1 mpc and 100 mpc or so . without knowing anything other than that about them , we see from ( [ m62 ] ) that for calculating potentials at galactic distance scales ( viz",
    ". scales much less than cluster scales of order @xmath347 ) the inhomogeneities would contribute constant and quadratic terms multiplied by integrals that are evaluated between end points such as @xmath347 that do not depend on the galaxy of interest , to thus be constants .",
    "thus , as noted in @xcite , we augment ( [ m65 ] ) to @xmath348 with asymptotic limit @xmath349 where @xmath350 .",
    "armed with ( [ m67 ] ) mannheim and obrien @xcite set out to extend the earlier 11 galaxy study of @xcite to a total sample of 138 galaxies that had become available in the interim ( a varied and broad sample that includes both high and low surface brightness galaxies and dwarfs ) . in making",
    "such fits the only parameter that can vary from one galaxy to the next is the galactic disk mass to light ratio as embodied in @xmath351 , with the parameters @xmath352 , @xmath346 and @xmath353 needing to be universal and not have any dependence on a given galaxy at all . to model the contribution of the luminous matter known",
    "photometric surface brightness data parameters and hi gas data parameters were used .",
    "the fits are thus highly constrained , one parameter per galaxy fits with all input data being known , with everything else being universal , and with no dark matter being assumed .",
    "now since the @xmath354-dependent term had not been used in the fits given in @xcite , one would immediately expect that it would be too small to be significant .",
    "however , because the 138 galaxy sample is so big , it contains galaxies whose rotation velocity data go out to radial distances much larger than the ones that had previously been considered .",
    "these data are thus sensitive to the distance - dependent @xmath355 term present in ( [ m67 ] ) , with the fitting underscoring the value of working with a large data sample .",
    "the fitting to the complete 138 galaxy sample is reported in @xcite , with the fitting to the 21 largest galaxies ( viz .",
    "those that are most sensitive to the @xmath355 term ) being reported here and in @xcite .",
    "the fitting shows that without any galactic dark matter ( [ m67 ] ) captures the essence of the data for the entire 138 galaxy sample , with the parameters @xmath344 and @xmath346 continuing to take the values given in ( [ m66 ] ) , and with @xmath354 being found to take a typical cluster - sized value @xmath356 in the figures we present the actual fitting to the 21 galaxy sample with all details being given in @xcite . in the figures",
    "the rotational velocities and errors ( in @xmath357 ) are plotted as a function of radial distance ( in @xmath358 ) . for each galaxy",
    "we exhibit the contribution due to the luminous newtonian term alone ( dashed curve ) , the contribution from the two linear terms alone ( dot dashed curve ) , the contribution from the two linear terms and the quadratic terms combined ( dotted curve ) , with the full curve showing the total contribution . because the data go out to such large distances the data are sensitive to the rise in velocity associated with the linear potential terms , and it is here that the quadratic term acts to actually arrest the rise altogether ( dotted curve ) and cause all rotation velocities to ultimately fall .",
    "moreover , since @xmath359 can not be negative , beyond a distance @xmath318 of order @xmath360 or so there could no longer be any bound galactic orbits , with galaxies thus having a natural way of terminating , and with global physics thus imposing a natural limit on the size of galaxies . to illustrate this we plot the rotation velocity curves for the galaxies ugc 128 and malin 1 over an extended range .",
    "term in ( [ m68 ] ) is never larger than of order the @xmath346 term since for galaxies the number of stars @xmath351 is never bigger than of order @xmath361 .",
    "hence for galaxies the maximum size associated with the distance in which the right - hand side of ( [ m68 ] ) vanishes is never larger than of order 100 kiloparsec . for clusters of galaxies",
    "@xmath351 is of order 1000 times larger as clusters typically contain 1000 galaxies . from ( [ m68 ] )",
    "the maximum allowed size for clusters is then well into the megaparsec region . ]",
    "it is important to appreciate that the fits provided by conformal gravity ( and likewise those provided by other alternate theories such as milgrom s mond theory @xcite and moffat s mstg / svtg theory @xcite ) are predictions .",
    "specifically , for all these theories the only input one needs is the photometric and hi gas data , and the only free parameter is the @xmath321 ratio for each given galaxy , with rotation velocities then being determined . that these highly constrained alternate theories all work is because not only do they each possess an either derived or postulated underlying universal scale ( a derived @xmath362 for conformal gravity , @xmath363 for mond and @xmath364 for mstg ) , all of the 138 galaxies in the sample possess it too .",
    "specifically , despite the huge variation in luminosity and surface brightness across the 138 galaxy sample , within one order of magnitude the measured values of the centripetal accelerations @xmath365 at the last data point in each galaxy are all found to cluster around a value of @xmath366 or so .",
    "for the 21 large galaxy sample for instance the values for @xmath367 all lie within the narrow range @xmath368 .",
    "it should also be noted that while the fits provided by conformal gravity are predictions , in contrast , dark matter fitting to galactic data works quite differently .",
    "there one first needs to know the velocities so that one can then ascertain the needed amount of dark matter , i.e. in its current formulation dark matter is only a parametrization of the velocity discrepancies that are observed and is not a prediction of them .",
    "dark matter theory has yet to develop to the point where it is able to predict rotation velocities given a knowledge of the luminous distribution alone ( or explain the near universality found for @xmath365 ) .",
    "thus dark matter theories , and in particular those theories that produce dark matter halos in the early universe , are currently unable to make an a priori determination as to which halo is to go with which particular luminous matter distribution , and need to fine - tune halo parameters to luminous parameters galaxy by galaxy . in the nfw cdm simulations @xcite for instance ,",
    "one finds generic spherical halo profiles close in form to @xmath369 $ ] ( as then cut off at some @xmath370 ) , but with the halo parameters @xmath371 , @xmath314 and @xmath370 needing to be fixed galaxy by galaxy .",
    "in addition to the galactic mass to light ratios , this requires 414 further parameters for the 138 galaxy sample ( or a further 276 parameters for isothermal halo type models ) .",
    "no such fine - tuning shortcomings appear in conformal gravity , and if standard gravity is to be the correct description of gravity , then a universal formula akin to the one given in ( [ m67 ] ) and the existence of the universal @xmath346 and @xmath354 parameters would need to be derived by dark matter theory .",
    "the conformal gravity fits are also noteworthy in that conformal gravity was not at all developed for the purpose of addressing the dark matter problem .",
    "rather , it was first advocated by the present author @xcite solely because it has a symmetry that could address the cosmological constant problem . however , once the starting action of ( [ m9 ] ) is assumed , one can then proceed purely deductively and derive the rotation curve formula given in ( [ m67 ] ) , a thus purely theoretical first principles approach .",
    "moreover , since our study of ( [ m67 ] ) then establishes that global physics has an influence on local galactic motions , the invoking of dark matter in galaxies could potentially be nothing more than an attempt to describe global physics effects in purely local galactic terms .",
    "in a recent paper t hooft @xcite has found an interesting connection between einstein gravity and conformal gravity . in standard treatments of quantum einstein gravity one",
    "makes a perturbative expansion in the metric and generates multi - loop feynman diagrams .",
    "each perturbative order requires a new counter - term , with the nth - order one being a function of the nth - power of the riemann tensor and its contractions . with the series not terminating ,",
    "einstein gravity is rendered non - renormalizable .    in his paper t hooft",
    "proposes a very different approach , one that is highly nonlinear .",
    "specifically , instead of evaluating the path integral as a perturbative series in the metric components @xmath1 , he proposes to treat the conformal factor in the metric as an independent degree of freedom .",
    "specifically , he makes a conformal transformation on the ( non - conformal invariant ) einstein - hilbert action of the form @xmath372 , to obtain @xmath373 with everything in @xmath28 now being evaluated in a geometry with metric @xmath374 . )",
    "we note that if set @xmath372 we obtain @xmath375 $ ] where both @xmath376 and the @xmath377 derivatives are evaluated in a geometry with metric @xmath374 .",
    "an integration by parts then yields ( [ m70 ] ) .",
    "] then instead of taking the path integral measure to be of the standard @xmath378 form , t hooft proposes that it be taken to be of the form @xmath379 .",
    "the utility of this approach is that since the @xmath380 dependence in @xmath28 is quadratic , the @xmath381 path integral can be done analytically .",
    "however , in order for the path integral to be bounded one needs to give @xmath380 an imaginary part . with this choice , the @xmath380 path integral will generate an effective action @xmath67 of the form @xmath382 $ ] , and after dimensional regularization is found not to generate an infinite set of divergent terms at all , but rather to only generate just one divergent term , viz .",

    "we immediately recognize the conformal gravity action .",
    "since the action in ( [ m70 ] ) is the same action as that obeyed by a conformally coupled scalar field , and the @xmath380 path integral measure is the same as that of a scalar field , everything is conformal , and the @xmath380 path integral can only generate a conformal invariant effective action  hence ( [ m71 ] ) . through the unusual treatment of the conformal factor",
    "we thus find a connection between einstein gravity and conformal gravity .    from the perspective of einstein gravity ,",
    "the utility of ( [ m71 ] ) is that since conformal gravity is renormalizable , the subsequent @xmath384 integration of @xmath67 should not generate any additional counter - terms , while the non - leading terms contained in @xmath382 $ ] would generate contributions to the path integration that could potentially be finite .",
    "one still has to deal with the divergent @xmath70 term in ( [ m71 ] ) , and rather than have it renormalized ( say by adding on an intrinsic conformal @xmath106 term ) , t hooft explores the possibility that @xmath70 remain uncanceled , and we refer the reader to his paper for details .",
    "( with @xmath70 appearing with the same overall sign in ( [ m16 ] ) and ( [ m71 ] ) , and with a gauge field path integration over its kinetic energy having the same sign too @xcite , an interplay between fermionic and bosonic fields can not cancel @xmath70  with massless superpartner fields not being able to effect the same cancellation in a curved background that they can achieve in a flat one . )",
    "while we thus generate a conformal action if we start with an einstein action , from the perspective of pure conformal gravity , conformal invariance prevents one from including an einstein term in the fundamental action at all .. ] however , in a pure conformal theory one still needs to use a measure that is conformal invariant .",
    "now the metric itself is not conformal invariant , and hence neither is the @xmath378 path integration measure .",
    "however , the quantity @xmath385 is conformal invariant and thus so is an integration measure of the form @xmath386 ( and analogously @xmath387 for fermions ) . in order to simplify the measure one would like to work in a conformal gauge in which the determinant of the metric is fixed to a convenient value such as one . and",
    "while it needs to be explored in detail , it is possible that adding an einstein term to the conformal action and taking the measure to be of the form @xmath388 might then serve as an appropriate conformal gauge fixing procedure .",
    "the fact that there would only be nine independent @xmath386 terms parallels the fact that the perturbative @xmath106 of ( [ m22 ] ) only depends on the traceless 9-component @xmath103 .",
    "additionally , the fact that one needs to give @xmath380 an imaginary part in order to obtain a well - defined path integral parallels the structure we found for the conformal theory , with unitarity being achieved by having the gravitational field be anti - hermitian .",
    "the present paper is the fifth in a series of publications in the journal on conformal gravity by the author , with much of the earlier work on the conformal theory having been reviewed in the previous four @xcite . in this review",
    "we have discussed some recent developments in the field and presented the case that can currently be made for conformal gravity . in particular",
    "we have shown how the conformal theory can quite naturally handle some of the most troublesome problems in physics , the quantum gravity problem , the vacuum energy problem , and the dark matter problem , being able to do so in the four spacetime dimensions for which there is evidence .",
    "as detailed in @xcite much more still needs to be done : anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background , large scale structure , cluster dynamics and lensing by clusters ( especially in light of the recently found global @xmath389 term in ( [ m67 ] ) and ( [ m68 ] ) ) , orbit decays of binary pulsars and gravity waves , solving the primordial deuterium problem that conformal nucleosynthesis has . ) .",
    "a first step toward addressing these issues and in developing conformal cosmological perturbation theory in general has recently been taken in p.  d.  mannheim ,  _ cosmological perturbations in conformal gravity _ , arxiv:1109.4119 [ gr - qc ] .",
    "it will be of interest to ascertain the degree to which conformal cosmological fluctuation theory is aware of the @xmath346 and @xmath354 scales , especially since @xmath354 is a matter fluctuation moment integral .",
    "] for all of these applications we only need to consider the particle contribution to the finite ( [ m32 ] ) , with the contribution of the vacuum sector including the cosmological constant having been taken care of by ( [ m31 ] ) .",
    "all of these issues should eventually prove definitive for the conformal theory , especially since it has none of the freedom associated with the difficult to pin down and still highly elusive dark matter and dark energy present in the standard theory .",
    "the highly constrained conformal gravity fits to galactic rotation curves have as yet no parallel in dark matter theory where parameters need to be fine - tuned galaxy by galaxy , and its natural solution to the cosmological constant problem has as yet no parallel in standard cosmology where @xmath30 needs to be fine - tuned to a degree without precedent in physics . to conclude",
    ", we note that at the beginning of the 20th century studies of black - body radiation on microscopic scales led to a paradigm shift in physics .",
