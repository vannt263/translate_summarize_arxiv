    "a new concept of quantum computation has been developed in recent years .",
    "the basic unit of a quantum computer is a quantum mechanical two - level system ( qubit ) that can be in coherent superpositions of the logical values 0 and 1 , as opposed to classical bits that represent either the values 0 or 1 .",
    "moreover , qubits can possess mutually tied properties while separated in space , so - called quantum entanglement .",
    "the implementation of computations is carried out by unitary transformations , which consist of the individual quantum logic gates .",
    "the utilization of superposition and entanglement leads to a high degree of parallelism , which makes the speed of certain types of computation exponentially faster than the classical counterpart @xcite .",
    "it has been known for a while that quantum entanglement has the potential to revolutionize the entire field of interferometry by providing many orders of magnitude improvement in interferometer sensitivity . in particular , without nonlocal entanglement ,",
    "a generic classical interferometer has a statistical - sampling shot - noise limited sensitivity however , if carefully prepared quantum correlations are engineered between the particles , then the interferometer sensitivity improves beyond the shot - noise limit .",
    "a few years ago we introduced the quantum rosetta stone by addressing the formal equivalence between a generic quantum logic gate , a ramsey - type atomic clock , an optical mach - zehnder interferometer @xcite .",
    "the quantum rosetta stone instigated transparent communication between the workers in these different areas of research , allowing them to adapt the techniques developed in the other areas to their own research - greatly advancing all three fields .",
    "in particular , we focus on the recent developments in optical implementations of quantum computing and address their utilization in quantum metrology and imaging for general audience .",
    "in optical approach to quantum computation , qubits are usually represented by the state of polarization of a single photon .",
    "the main difficulty lies in the fact that the necessary two - qubit logic gates need a nonlinear interaction between the two photons and the efficiency of this nonlinear interaction is typically very tiny at the single - photon level .",
    "this obstacle , however , can be avoided by making corrections to the output of the logic devices based on the results of single - photon detectors . in this section",
    "we describe the basic one - qubit operations , non - deterministic two - qubit gates , near - deterministic two - qubit gates , and certain issues related to their implementations .",
    "then , the z - rotation , for example , can be achieved by a waveplate and phase shifters .",
    "the wave plate is a doubly refracting ( birefringent ) transparent crystal where the index of refraction is larger for the slow axis than the one for the fast axis .",
    "let us assume that the slow axis is vertical direction and the fast is the horizontal direction .",
    "after propagating by a distance @xmath1 , the vertically polarized light acquires a phase shift of @xmath2 $ ] , and similarly , the horizontally polarized light acquires @xmath3 $ ] ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the relative phase shift acquired by the vertically polarized light is then                                                                      having the x - rotation , z - rotation , and the phase gate , it is now sufficient to build any arbitrary one qubit gate .",
    "for example , the hadamard gate , one of the most frequently used one - qubit gates in the literature , can be build as follows .                   where the second qubit ( target ) flips when the first qubit ( control ) has in the logical value 1 .",
    "the cnot gate plays an important role in that any n - qubit gates can be decomposed into the cnot gates and one - qubit gates and thus form a universal set of gates .",
    "the cnot gate is then simply constructed by using the conditional sign flip and two one - qubit gates ( e.g. , hadamard on the target , followed by the conditional sign flip and another hadamard on the target ) .",
    "note that the cnot is the controlled @xmath19 operation whereas the c - z gate is the controlled @xmath20 operation    the optical kerr nonlinearity was first considered for such a conditional sign flip .",
    "the interaction caused by the kerr nonlinearity can be described by a hamiltonian @xcite _",
    "kerr = , [ kerr ] where @xmath21 is a coupling constant depending on the third - order nonlinear susceptibility , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the creation and annihilation operators for two optical modes",
    ". one convenient choice of the logical qubit can then be represented by the two modes containing a single photon , denoted as |0_l & = & |0_l  |1_k +    modes , and we have used the notation @xmath26 for a logical qubit , in order to distinguish it from the photon - number states @xmath27 . the conversion between this so - called dual rail qubit and the polarization qubit",
    "can be simply made by polarizing beam splitters .",
    "now let us assign mode 1,2 for the control qubit , and 3,4 for the target qubit .",
    "suppose now only the modes 2,4 are coupled under the interaction given by eq.([kerr ] ) .",
    "for a given interaction time @xmath28 , the transformation can be written as |0_l |0_l & &  |0_l |0_l +        @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this operation yields a conditional phase shift .",
    "when @xmath31 , we have the two two - qubit gate called the conditional sign - flip gate . in order to have @xmath32 at the single - photon level , however , a huge third - order nonlinear coupling is required @xcite . however",
    ", this barrier can be circumvented by quantum teleportation technique in one hand , and effective nonlinearities produced by projective measurements in the other @xcite .",
    "together with quantum teleportation the nonlinear sign ( ns ) gate serves the basic element in the architecture of linear optics quantum computation .",
    "the ns gate applies to photon number state consists of zero , one and two photons as is defined by        the ns gate can be implemented non - deterministically by three beam splitters , two photo - detectors , and one ancilla photon as depicted in fig.[ns-1 ] . conditioned upon a specific detector outcome",
    ", we can have the desired output state with probability of 1/4 .",
    "the gate operation succeeds only once in four times on average .",
    "but , the merit is that we know we it was successful whenever it was successful .",
    "if one wants , for example , to rely on a vacuum detection ( or , in other words , no - photons detection ) in both output ancilla modes , then one can realize a scheme depicted on fig.[noon-4](a ) . in this case",
    "each input mode is fed with only one photon and the four - photon noon state is generated upon a vacuum measurement in both output ancilla modes@xcite .",
    "alternatively , a scheme based on a coincidence detection in the output ancilla modes is presented on fig.[noon-4](b ) . here , the input ancilla modes contain zero photons @xcite .",
    "a scheme based on a coincidence detection and non - zero ancilla input is also possible and depicted on fig.[noon-4](c ) .",
    "the variety of possible realizations of a given noon state sets up a question about the most optimal configuration of a noon state generator ."
