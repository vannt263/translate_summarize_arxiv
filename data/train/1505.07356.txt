    "the theorem above is derived as a consequence of a rigidity result involving a uniform time - average growth of sobolev norms of solutions to ( see theorem [ thm : rigidity ] ) .",
    "this criterion , verified for linear problems , could in principle be used to deduce similar conclusions for nonlinear systems ( see remark [ rmk : nonlin ] below ) .",
    "the idea of balancing diffusion and noise by scaling with the parameter @xmath21 was introduced in the context of the two - dimensional navier - stokes and euler equations in a periodic domain in @xcite , and later extended to other systems @xcite .",
    "the resulting invariant measures are expected to give some information about the generic , long - time dynamics of the inviscid systems in weak topologies , that is , taking into account the possibility of infinite - dimensional effects such as mixing and inviscid damping @xcite . however , for most nonlinear problems , for example the 2d euler equations , we currently do not have much explicit information about these measures @xcite .",
    "the mixing of passive scalars at high peclet number ( @xmath22 in ) is a subject of enduring interest in applied mathematics ( see e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) , which provides a clear motivation for studying .",
    "another motivation for studying passive scalars lies in the fact that , unlike nonlinear problems , spectral properties of @xmath5 provide precise information about the long - time behavior of  an idea that can be traced back to the seminal work @xcite , where weakly mixing flows are identified with dynamical systems with purely continuous spectra .",
    "this additional information will allow us to prove theorem [ thm : ee ] and confirm the intuition that the inviscid invariant measures constructed in the manner described above should mostly retain information about the long - time dynamics of the large scales in the solutions , rather than information about the `` enstrophy '' in the small scales .",
    "the intuitive idea of our result is as follows : if @xmath23 mixes the scalar , then small scales are created and then rapidly annihilated by the dissipation on time scales faster than the natural @xmath24 scale . this mixing - enhanced dissipation effect and related mechanisms have been studied in several works , e.g. @xcite and the references above ( see also remarks [ rmk : ga]-[rmk : fried ] for discussions about other types of small noise limits ) . in @xcite ,",

    ".    in our context , theorem [ thm : ee ] shows that in the case of relaxation enhancing flows the only invariant measure produced by small noise limits is a point mass at zero .",
    "note that this is in sharp contrast to the case of 2d navier - stokes to euler limit , where it is known that the resulting inviscid measures can not collapse to a single point ; namely , the possibility of @xmath13 being a dirac mass on a steady state is ruled out by conservation of energy and enstrophy @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental differences between the situation considered here and the 2d navier - stokes equations is the lack of an @xmath28 balance for the solution to .",
    "indeed , @xmath0 is the analogue of the vorticity , and the energy balance for 2d navier - stokes is precisely an @xmath28 balance for the vorticity . in the linear problem , the measures can certainly reduce to a point mass : the most apparent example is given by weakly mixing flows , and more generally relaxation enhancing flows , but this can also happen for simple shear flows depending on the structure of the noise ( see section [ sec : examples ] ) .      in section",

    ". we also have the straightforward estimate from the heat equation which holds regardless of the velocity field @xmath1 ( as long as it is incompressible ) , @xmath334 where @xmath335 is the first ( non - zero ) eigenvalue of the laplacian .",

    "notice that the quantitative estimate plays a crucial role in the proof of theorem [ thm : relaxkuksin ] described above , and highlights the usefulness of having a more quantitative understanding of @xmath250 for @xmath319 .      in this section",

    "denote for any @xmath341 the operator @xmath391 therefore , to compute the covariance , for any @xmath341 we have @xmath392 the first term , @xmath393 , is independent of @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , since @xmath394 are eigenfunctions of the heat operator : @xmath395 on the other hand , because @xmath396 is relaxation enhancing , the latter term is estimated precisely as in in the proof of theorem [ thm : relaxkuksin ] .",
    "hence , we may deduce as above that @xmath397 and therefore @xmath398 completing the proof .      in this section",
    "we discuss one last example in which we can get some additional regularity and other kinds of information due to the rigidity of @xmath19 , even if we can not determine the invariant measures precisely .    for a smooth streamfunction @xmath399",

    "above , denote @xmath418 clearly , there are many non - smooth eigenfunctions corresponding to the zero eigenvalue ( such as functions which are constant over one cell and zero elsewhere ) , however , the kuksin measures are also supported on @xmath4 , which together with the form of the eigenfunctions , imposes additional rigidity .",
    "in particular we have the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : cell ] let @xmath1 be a non - degenerate cellular flow on @xmath401 .",

    "first note that the streamlines of the flow are precisely the level curves of @xmath399 .",
    "the first step is to prove that all @xmath4 eigenfunctions of @xmath366 are constant along streamlines almost everywhere using a variant of the argument employed in theorem [ thm : shearchar ] .",

    "hence , for almost every @xmath445 , @xmath444 is periodic with period @xmath446 and from the chain rule we have @xmath447 in the sense of distributions . for each @xmath413",

    "however , by the non - degeneracy hypotheses , @xmath446 can take the same value only finitely many times and hence @xmath444 must be constant in @xmath449 for almost every @xmath413 .",
    "it follows then that @xmath148 is constant along streamlines within the cells .",
    "since the edge - vertex network is a measure - zero set , we therefore have that all @xmath4 eigenfunctions are constant along streamlines almost everywhere .",
    "it further follows that all @xmath4 eigenfunctions have eigenvalue zero .",
    "next , let @xmath420 be arbitrary . since all of the @xmath4 eigenfunctions correspond to the same eigenvalue ( zero )",
    ", it follows that @xmath148 is itself necessarily an @xmath4 eigenfunction .",
    "we have thus deduced that @xmath451 using diffeomorphisms to locally straighten the streamlines , we see that because @xmath148 is constant along streamlines , it follows that @xmath148 must be @xmath422 away from @xmath452 ( the set of fixed points ) by morrey s theorem @xmath453 . that is , @xmath148 is @xmath422 in any compact set @xmath423 such that @xmath424 .",
