    "it has often been considered that the narrow - line regions ( nlrs ) in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are photoionized by the radiation from central engines . however , this photoionization scenario has sometimes been conflicted with several serious problems .",
    "one of such problems is that any single - zone photoionization models underpredict the [ o iii]@xmath04363/[o iii]@xmath05007 flux ratio , @xmath1 ( e.g. , simpson et al .",
    "1996 ) . to solve this problem ,",
    "some models have been proposed ; e.g. , two component models with high - density gas clouds ( e.g. , filippenko 1985 ) or those with shock - heated regions ( e.g. , dopita & sutherland 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , some previous studies reported that type 1 and type 1.5 seyfert nuclei ( s1s and s1.5s , respectively ) tend to have higher @xmath1 values than type 2 seyfert nuclei ( s2s ) ( e.g. , heckman & balick 1979 ) .    in order to know where and how the [ o iii]@xmath04363 emission is radiated , and in order to solve the underprediction problem of @xmath1 , it seems critically important to investigate why s1s show higher @xmath1 than s2s",
    "therefore , we examine how the observed value of @xmath1 depends on the agn type based on a large sample of agns compiled from the literature .",
    "then , we compare @xmath1 with various parameters to know the nature of the [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting regions in agns ( see nagao , murayama , & taniguchi 2001 for more details ) .",
    "in order to investigate statistical properties of @xmath1 , we compiled @xmath1 of 82 s1s , 54 s1.5s , and 78 s2s , from the literature .",
    "the histograms of @xmath1 for each seyfert type are shown in figure 1 .",
    "it is clearly shown that the s2s exhibit lower @xmath1 than the s1s and the s1.5s . according to the kolmogorov - smirnov statistical test",
    ", the probability which the distribution of @xmath1 of s2s and that of s1s or s1.5s come from the same underlying population is less than 10@xmath2 .",
    "to explore the origin of this agn - type dependence of @xmath1 and the nature of the [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting regions , we compare @xmath1 with various parameters .",
    "the results are as follows :    * _ the higher-@xmath1 objects show the hotter mid - infrared ( mir ) colors . _",
    "the hotter mir colors are thought to be attributed to the hotter dusty grains located at the inner surface of the dusty tori , which can be seen if we see the torus from a favored viewing angle ( i.e. , a nearly face - on view ) .",
    "therefore , this means that the higher-@xmath3 objects are seen from a more face - on view toward dusty tori than the lower-@xmath1 objects . * _ the higher-@xmath1 objects show the stronger [ fe vii]@xmath06087 and [ fe x]@xmath06374 emission .",
    "_ since a large fraction of high - ionization emission lines is thought to arise from dense gas clouds obscured by the dusty tori ( e.g. , murayama & taniguchi 1998a ) , the higher-@xmath1 can be attributed to the significant flux contribution from such a high - density gas cloud . * _ the higher-@xmath1 objects tend to show the larger fwhm([o iii]@xmath04363)/ fwhm([o iii]@xmath05007 ) ratios .",
    "_ this also suggests that the [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting regions are located at inner regions compared to the [ o iii]@xmath05007 emitting regions . * _ the s1s have wider fwhm([o iii]@xmath04363 ) and larger ratio of fwhm([o iii]@xmath04363)/fwhm([o iii]@xmath05007 ) than the s2s .",
    "_ this suggests that the [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting regions are located at inner regions compared to the [ o iii]@xmath05007 emitting regions and have an anisotropic property .",
    "all of these facts can be consistently understood when we introduce the high - density gas clouds located close to the nucleus , which emit a large fraction of the [ o iii]@xmath04363 emission . since these clouds may suffer significantly from the obscuration by dusty tori in s2s",
    ", we conclude that the agn - type dependence of @xmath1 is attributed to the viewing - angle dependence of the visibility of the high - density gas clouds .",
    "to examine whether or not the viewing - angle dependence of the visibility of the high - density gas can account for the observed difference in @xmath1 between s1s and s2s in the framework of the photoionization scheme , we carry out dual - component photoionization model calculations following the manner of murayama & taniguchi ( 1998b ) .",
    "this method takes account of such high - density gas clouds as a strong [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitter , in addition to the typical nlr component .",
    "we perform model calculations using the spectral synthesis code @xmath4 version 90.04 ( ferland 1996 ) .",
    "we assume uniform density gas clouds with a plane - parallel geometry .",
    "the dense component ( dc ) is assumed to be truncated clouds to avoid unusually strong [ o i ] emission .",
    "here we assume @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "we perform several model runs covering @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath6 .",
    "the ionization parameter of the nlr component is assumed as @xmath9 = 10@xmath10 .",
    "the ionization parameter and the hydrogen column density of dc are determined by the following two conditions : ( [ fe x]/[fe vii])@xmath11 = 0.8 and ( [ fe vii]/[o iii]@xmath05007)@xmath11 = 1.0 .",
    "the former ratio is the typical value of seyfert galaxies ( nagao , taniguchi , & murayama 2000 ) , and the latter condition is introduced by murayama & taniguchi ( 1998b ) . as a result , @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath13 cm@xmath10 are adopted .",
    "the calculations are stopped when the gas temperature falls to 4000k for the nlr component .",
    "we set the gas - phase element abundances to be solar ones .",
    "we adopt the power - law continuum as @xmath15 = 1.5 between 10 @xmath16 m and 50 kev in the form @xmath17 .",
    "the spectral index is set to @xmath15 = 2.5 at lower energy ( i.e. , @xmath18 m ) and to @xmath15 = 2 at higher energy ( i.e. , @xmath19 50 kev ) .",
    "the fraction of dc to the nlr component is treated as a free parameter in our calculations .",
    "we present our model calculations and compare them with the observations in a diagram of @xmath1 versus [ fe vii]/[o iii]@xmath05007 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we find that the model grids are roughly consistent with the observations if we take the effects of the correction for the extinction into account .",
    "though the dispersion of observation appears to be larger than the model grids , this may be attributed to the fact that the parameters , e.g. , @xmath9 and @xmath20 , are different from object to object .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath1 of the s1s can be explained by introducing a 5%  20% contribution from dc while the @xmath1 of the s2s can be explained by introducing a 0%  2% contribution from dc .    through the dual - component photoionization model calculations ,",
    "we conclude that ( 1 ) the origin of the agn - type dependence of @xmath1 is the viewing - angle dependence ( i.e. , the agn - type dependence ) of the visibility of the dense gas clouds which can be hidden by dusty tori , and ( 2 ) the underprediction problem of @xmath1 is solved taking such high - density gas clouds into account .",
