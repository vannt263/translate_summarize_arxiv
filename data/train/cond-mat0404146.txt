    "in recent decades the electric transport through quantum dots ( qd ) has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . as the result a comprehensive picture of a big variety of underlying physical phenomena has emerged ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . as qd s are small droplets of electrons confined in the three spatial directions , energy and charge quantization , and strong coulomb repulsion among the electrons results from this confinement .",
    "as these features are shared with real atomic systems , from the very beginning an extremely useful analogy has been exploited between `` real '' and `` artificial '' atomic systems .",
    "this analogy received strong support through an experimental breakthrough where the kondo effect in quantum dots was unambiguously measured.@xcite historically , the kondo effect was introduced more than forty years ago to explain the resistivity minimum for decreasing temperatures observed in metallic matrices with a minute fraction of magnetic impurities.@xcite according to the detailed microscopic theory , when the temperature @xmath1 decreases below the kondo temperature @xmath2 , each of the localized magnetic impurities starts to interact strongly with the surrounding electronic cloud , which finally results in a singlet many - body ground state , reaching its maximum strength at @xmath3@xcite the minimum in the resistivity results from the fact that , as the temperature is lowered , the scattering with phonons decreases down to a temperature at which the scattering with localized impurities becomes important as the kondo effect starts being operative .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in this case , the so - called traditional kondo effect , magnetic impurities act as scattering centers , _ increasing _ the sample resistivity",
    ".    the opposite behavior is found in some circumstances in the kondo effect in quantum dots .",
    "the situation considered almost without exception both theoretically and experimentally , consists of a quantum dot connected to two leads in such a way that electrons transmitted from one electrode to other should necessarily pass through the quantum dot ( _ a substitutional dot _ ) .",
    "as theoretical calculations predicted,@xcite in this configuration and when the dot is occupied by an odd number of electrons , the conductance _ increases _ when decreasing the temperature and the kondo effect sets in , essentially due to a resonant transmission through the so - called kondo resonance which appears in the local density of states at the dot site at the fermi level of the leads .",
    "in this situation , at @xmath4 , the conductance should take the limiting value @xmath5 corresponding to the unitary limit of a one - dimensional perfect transmission channel.@xcite at finite temperatures @xmath6 the kondo effect is destroyed and only the standard coulomb blockade remains@xcite , which manifests itself in strong oscillations of the dot s conductance versus the gate voltage applied to the dot .",
    "the aim of this work is to theoretically review the results for an alternative configuration of a _ side - coupled _ quantum dot , attached to a perfect quantum wire . in this case , the quantum dot acts as a scattering center for transmission through the chain , in close analogy with the traditional kondo effect .",
    "we have found that when the dot provides a resonant energy for scattering , the conductance has a sharp decrease , reminiscent of the fano resonances observed in scanning tunneling microscope experiments for magnetic atoms on a metallic substrate.@xcite and qd s coupled sideways to a quantum wire@xcite .",
    "a similar problem has been discussed by other authors@xcite .",
    "we differ from them in that they have used approximate methods to describe the kondo regime ( slave - boson mean field theory@xcite , interpolative perturbation scheme@xcite and x - slave - boson treatment@xcite),while our numerical results take into account the many body interactions in a very precise and controlled way .",

    "we discuss here that if the spin degeneracy is lifted , say , by an applied magnetic field , and if the splitting exceeds the temperature , the resonances for spin up and spin down electrons become well separated in the absence of the kondo effect for the case of side - coupled quantum dots .",
    "this gives rise to the resonant spin polarized conductance due to the effect of fano interference .",

    "if the level is spin degenerate the kondo effect suppresses the channel conductance in a broad range of the gate voltages .",
    "when the coupling between the channel and the dot is not truly local the resonances should become highly antisymmetric . in the idealized picture of the single ballistic channel transport",
    "the zero temperature conductance vanishes at the resonance values of the gate voltage due to the fano interference . if there is no spin degeneracy , the resonances have single - particle origin ( for the simple model of fig .",
    "1b they are separated roughly by the coulomb energy @xmath158 ) . at resonance the channel conductance for a certain spin direction changes abruptly from its ballistic value @xmath85 to zero , while the opposite spin conductance remains approximately at the ballistic value .",
    "this is in contrast with previous calculations that considered a substitutional qd , where the complementary effect is found , i.e. , a perfect conductance for one spin species .",
    "however , in these cases due to the local correlations and hibridization with the leads , there remains a finite conductance of the opposite spin species blurring the filtering condition . in the lateral dot case considered here",
    "we find _ total _ suppression of one spin species , thus leading to a perfect spin filter .",
    "moreover we obtain that the energetical splitting of the fano resonances for spin up and spin down electrons is of the order of the coulomb interaction @xmath0 for large @xmath0 rather than of the order of the zeeman splitting @xmath200 as it would be for noninteracting electrons @xmath91 .",
    "thus a strong electron interaction on the dot ( realistic values for @xmath0 are of the order of 1mev ) will allow to apply very weak magnetic fields ( less than 1tesla ) and still observe a significant splitting of the fano resonances ( provided @xmath201 ) , and thus a high quality spin filter .",
    "this is because not only the spin filter is totally reflecting electrons with the desired spin @xmath202 , but it will be then also nearly fully transparent for electrons with opposite spin .",
    "note , however , that the coupling to the dot should preserve the phase coherence and there should be only one conducting channel .     and different magnetic fields ; bottom : several gate voltage values @xmath117 and small magnetic field @xmath203.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]   and different magnetic fields ; bottom : several gate voltage values @xmath117 and small magnetic field @xmath203.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we believe that our calculations also shed light on recent experiments by gres",
    "_ et al._@xcite _  _ using the same samples of ref.(@xcite ) , and changing the transmission of the left and right tunnel barriers which connect the dot to the conducting leads , they perform conductance measurements in the fano regime ( strong coupling leads - dot ) , the kondo regime ( intermediate coupling ) , and the coulomb blockade regime ( weak coupling leads - dot ) .",
    "the main results concern to the fano regime , where the conductance shows asymmetric fano dips on top of a slowly varying background .",
    "some features of the dips are reminiscent of the kondo effect , as the temperature dependence of the dips amplitudes ( fig . 4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and others of the coulomb blockade effect , as the typical diamond - shaped structure in differential conductance measurements ( fig . 5 in ref .",
    "both features are easily explained by our results .",
    "for example , from fig .",
    "8a , and considering that finite temperature weakens the kondo resonance at the fermi energy in a similar way as the magnetic field , one can expect a strong dependence of dip amplitude with temperature , with the dip amplitude decreasing for increasing temperature .",
    "besides , the behavior of dips in differential conductance measurements should be completely analogous to the related coulomb blockade peaks , leading to diamond - shaped structures for the dips . our results also shed light on the somehow related problem of the persistent current in a mesoscopic ring with a _ side _",
