    "a thermal rectifier @xcite can be defined as a device that connects asymmetrically two thermal reservoirs : the heat current transmitted through the diode depends on the sign of the temperature bias imposed to the reservoirs .",
    "this non - linear device represents the thermal counterpart of the well - known electric diode , which helped the extraordinary evolution of modern electronics together with the transistor .",
    "the realization of efficient thermal rectifiers would represent a giant leap for the control of heat currents at the nanoscale , @xcite boosting emerging fields such as coherent caloritronics,@xcite nanophononics,@xcite and thermal logic.@xcite furthermore , a great number of nanoscience fields , including solid state cooling,@xcite ultrasensitive cryogenic radiation detection@xcite and quantum information,@xcite might strongly benefit from the possibility of releasing the dissipated power to the thermal bath in an unidirectional way .    a highly efficient thermal diode should provide differences of at least one order of magnitude between the heat current transmitted in the forward temperature - bias configuration , @xmath0 , and that generated upon temperature bias reversal , @xmath1 .",
    "this is equivalent to say that the rectification efficiency @xmath2 must be @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "since the first theoretical proposal,@xcite several groups have put a great effort into envisioning different designs for thermal rectifiers dealing with phonons,@xcite electrons@xcite and photons.@xcite alongside these theoretical works , promising experimental results were obtained in systems that exploited phononic@xcite and electronic@xcite thermal currents .",
    "nevertheless , a maximum @xmath5 has been reported@xcite and more efficient rectification mechanisms are required to realize competitive thermal diodes .    in this article",
    ", we will focus on the rectification performance of devices based on tunnel - junctions between normal metal ( n ) and superconducting ( s ) thin films at low temperatures .",
    "first , we will review the intrinsic properties of single nin , nis and s@xmath6is@xmath7 junctions@xcite ( where i stands for an insulating barrier and s@xmath6 and s@xmath7 represent two different superconducting electrodes ) .",
    "then , we will analyze possible improvements of the rectification efficiency when these structures are combined together forming an asymmetric chain of tunnel - coupled islands.@xcite in particular , as we shall argue , an asymmetric coupling to the phonon bath can strongly enhance the efficiency of the device , providing outstanding values of @xmath8 with realistic parameters .",
    "very recently , the latter mechanism has been experimentally demonstrated in a hybrid device exhibiting a maximum rectification efficiency of @xmath9.@xcite",
    "we shall start , first of all , by describing the equations governing heat transport in simple nin and nis junctions . in these opening sections , we focus on the electronic heat currents only , and neglect possible contributions by lattice phonons .",
    "the latter will be discussed in the analysis of chain diodes .",
    "if we consider two n electrodes residing at electronic temperatures @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 ) coupled by means of a tunnel junction , the stationary electronic thermal current flowing through the junction can be written as:@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the contact resistance , @xmath15 is the electron charge and @xmath16 is the boltzmann s constant . equation ( [ jnin ] ) clearly shows that no rectification is possible in a full normal - metal tunnel junction , since @xmath17 .",
    "however , if we substitute the second n electrode with a superconductor , the thermal current flowing through the nis junction becomes:@xcite @xmath18.\\label{jnis } \\end{aligned}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath19 \\right|$ ] is the smeared ( by non - zero @xmath20 ) normalized bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) density of states ( dos ) in the superconductor,@xcite @xmath21 is the temperature - dependent superconducting energy gap with a critical temperature @xmath22 and @xmath23^{-1}$ ] is the fermi - dirac distribution function . in the following , we will assume @xmath24 , which describes realistic nis junctions.@xcite we also define @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the forward and the reverse configuration , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) shows the influence of the superconducting dos on @xmath27 : at a first glance , @xmath0 immediately appears different from @xmath1 , thanks to the temperature dependence of @xmath21 , which breaks the thermal symmetry of the tunnel junction .",
    "for @xmath28 the value of @xmath21 in the reverse configuration starts to decrease and @xmath1 gets significantly larger than @xmath0 , leading to @xmath29 , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig1](b ) . on the contrary , if @xmath10 is raised above @xmath30 , heat flux from n to s becomes preferred , resulting in @xmath31 .",
    "as @xmath11 is increased , the reverse rectification regime gets gradually suppressed , while the forward regime becomes more efficient .",
    "we can highlight this behavior by introducing the optimal rectification efficiency @xmath32 , defined as that corresponding to the maximum value between @xmath8 and @xmath33 at a given @xmath11 .",
    "this quantity provides the best working point of the diode , which can occur in the forward ( if @xmath34 ) or in the reverse ( if @xmath35 ) regime of rectification . as displayed in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , for @xmath36 the reverse regime is the most efficient , while at higher temperatures the forward regime is favored .",
    "finally , at @xmath37 the system turns into a nin junction and no rectification is possible .",
    "it is also worth noting that at low values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath38 is suppressed by a factor @xmath20 with respect to @xmath39 and does not depend on the sign of the temperature bias [ see inset of fig . [ fig1](a ) ] , indicating the effectiveness of @xmath21 as a thermal bottleneck . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath10 and @xmath11 increase , @xmath40 becomes significantly different from zero at energies higher than the smeared @xmath21 : this corresponds to a rapid increase of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as indicated by the arrow in the inset .",
    "thus , the thermal bottleneck effect generated by the superconducting energy gap decays quickly by raising temperatures .",
    "although this change of behavior is not relevant for the rectifying properties of a single nis junction , it will be important to understand the operation of a ninisin chain .",
    "we now move to the case in which both the tunnel - coupled electrodes are superconductors , i.e. , a s@xmath6is@xmath7 junction.@xcite the latter can be thermally biased by setting the quasiparticle temperature of one electrode to @xmath10 and that of the other to @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , we assume that s@xmath6 and s@xmath7 are characterized by different superconducting energy gaps @xmath41 and @xmath42 and by a phase difference @xmath43 .",

    "this term is peculiar to the josephson effect ( so it vanishes if one or both of the superconducting energy gaps are null ) and originates from tunneling processes through the junctions involving both cooper pairs and quasiparticles.@xcite depending on @xmath56 , @xmath49 can flow in opposite direction with respect to that imposed by the thermal gradient , but the total heat current still flows from the hot to the cold reservoir , preserving the second principle of thermodynamics .",
    "this was experimentally demonstrated in ref . .",
    "in the following , we shall assume , for clarity , that @xmath57 .",
    "figure [ fig2](a ) shows the behavior of @xmath58 and @xmath59 vs. @xmath10 for @xmath60 ( @xmath61 being the critical temperature of s@xmath6 ) and @xmath62 .",
    "the difference between the heat currents is particularly evident for @xmath63 : in the forward configuration , @xmath0 exhibits a sharp peak at @xmath64 , due to the matching of singularities in superconducting doss when @xmath65 . at higher values of @xmath10 , @xmath66 and the energy transmission through the junction",
    "is reduced , leading to a negative thermal differential conductance region , which is further enhanced by the gradual suppression of @xmath49 as @xmath10 approaches @xmath61 . in the reverse configuration , instead , @xmath1 presents just one cusp caused by the vanishing of @xmath49 when @xmath67 .",
    "then , the rectification efficiency is maximum when the aforementioned points are perfectly aligned , i.e. , @xmath68 for @xmath62 and @xmath64 at @xmath60 , as shown in figs . [ fig2](b ) and [ fig2](c ) .",
    "as @xmath11 is increased , @xmath69 decreases monotonically to @xmath70 at @xmath71 , then it becomes @xmath72 and finally reaches the identity for @xmath73 ( data not shown ) .",
    "more interestingly , the rectification efficiency can be finely tuned by controlling the phase bias across the junction . as a matter of fact , if @xmath74 , @xmath8 is not only reduced by one order of magnitude but it also inverts the favored rectification regime , as displayed by fig . [ fig2](d ) .",
    "this effect can be readily understood by observing the trend of @xmath58 and @xmath59 vs. @xmath10 for @xmath75 [ see fig . [ fig2](a ) ] . in this case , the negative sign in front of @xmath49 in eq .",
    "[ int ] perfectly cancels the singularity - matching peak in the forward configuration .    to conclude the analysis of the intrinsic properties of nis and s@xmath6is@xmath7 junctions , it is worthwhile to summarize the conditions necessary to achieve heat rectification : ( 1 ) two _ different _ doss must be tunnel coupled ( i.e. , @xmath76 ) and ( 2 ) at least one of them must be strongly temperature dependent in the range of operation .",
    "furthermore , a fairly large temperature gradient is needed , since heat rectification is absent in the linear response regime , i.e. , when @xmath77.@xcite",
    "the rectifying performance of the discussed tunnel junctions can be largely improved if they are combined in an asymmetric chain of tunnel - coupled electrodes that can exchange energy with an independent phonon bath residing at temperature @xmath78 .",
    "we stress that we are concerned with the heat current carried by electrons only .",
    "we assume that lattice phonons present in the entire structure are thermalized , with substrate phonons residing at @xmath78 , and are therefore not responsible for any heat transport .",
    "this assumption is expected to hold because the kapitza resistance between thin metallic films and the substrate is vanishingly small at low temperatures.@xcite    we shall begin with a simple n@xmath6in@xmath7in@xmath79 chain,@xcite which , as we will show , represents a fundamental element to understand the working principles of chain diodes .",
    "n@xmath6 and n@xmath79 act as thermal reservoirs and are used to impose a temperature gradient across the device . since @xmath8 is defined under the condition of equal temperature bias , these electrodes must be identical and equally coupled to the phonon bath .",
    "thus , @xmath78 now plays the role embodied by @xmath11 in the single junction analysis .",
    "n@xmath7 is connected to n@xmath6 and n@xmath79 by means of two tunnel junctions characterized by resistances @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively . for simplicity , we assume @xmath80 equal to 1 k@xmath82 and consider only the parameter @xmath83 , accounting for the asymmetry of the chain .",
    "n@xmath7 is the core of the diode and controls the heat flow from one reservoir to the other by releasing energy to the phonon bath . in the forward configuration , the electronic temperature of n@xmath6",

    "we will consider two materials that are commonly exploited to realize n electrodes in nanostructures , i.e. , copper ( cu ) and manganese - doped aluminum ( almn ) .",

    ".        equations [ jnin ] and [ jqpph ] can be used to elaborate a thermal model accounting for heat transport through the device .",

    "finally , we can extract the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , thereby obtaining @xmath8 .    in order to grasp the essential physics underlying this device , it is instructive to consider an ideal case , in which n@xmath6 , n@xmath7 and n@xmath79 can release energy to the phonon bath only through three tunnel - coupled n electrodes , acting as thermalizing cold fingers@xcite and labeled as f@xmath6 , f@xmath7 and f@xmath79 , respectively .",

    "as we shall argue , f@xmath7 is fundamental to achieve a high rectification performance and is characterized by a resistance @xmath110 , while f@xmath6 and f@xmath79 must have the same tunnel junction resistance @xmath111 .",
    "we ignore at this stage contributions due to the direct quasiparticle - phonon coupling ( see eq .",

    ", this ideal device can be easily described by substituting @xmath112 and @xmath113 in eqs .",
    "[ eqs ] . remarkably , the resulting expression for the rectification efficiency does not depend on @xmath10 nor @xmath78 , but only on the resistances of the tunnel junctions defining our ninin chain : @xmath114 equation [ rideal ] is particularly transparent in two limit cases : first , if @xmath115 , @xmath116 for every value of @xmath117 .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that no rectification is achievable if the central island of the chain is not coupled to the phonon bath , regardless the asymmetry of the device .",
    "this result holds true for a general design of a ninin chain , provided that n@xmath6 and n@xmath79 are identically coupled to the phonon bath.@xcite    on the other hand , if @xmath118 , eq . [ rideal ]",
    "is simplified as follows : @xmath119 this expression summarizes the conditions needed to obtain an highly - efficient ninin diode : ( 1 ) the thermal symmetry of the device must be broken ( @xmath120 ) and ( 2 ) n@xmath7 must be very well coupled to the phonon bath with respect to n@xmath6 and n@xmath79 .",
    "a natural trade off arising from the fulfilment of these conditions is the reduction of the thermal efficiency of the device @xmath121 , i.e. , the fraction of energy that is actually transferred from one reservoir to the other in the transmissive regime.@xcite nevertheless , the device parameters can be designed in order to maximize the required performance in terms of the global efficiency @xmath122,@xcite which can range from 0 to @xmath123 , since @xmath8 has no upper limit .",
    "finally , this ideal case demonstrates that such a thermal rectifier can operate efficiently also in the regime for @xmath124 .    in a more realistic case",
    ", every electrode in the chain can exchange energy with the phonon bath by means of the quasiparticle - phonon coupling , which introduces a temperature dependence in the rectification efficiency .",

    "electrode n@xmath7 can release energy to the phonon bath via @xmath153 , while n@xmath79 is coupled to @xmath78 through @xmath154 .",
    "finally , s@xmath6 and s@xmath7 are affected by the quasiparticle - phonon coupling @xmath197 . in general",
    ", the junction s@xmath7is@xmath6 can be phase biased through supercurrent injection or by applying an external magnetic flux.@xcite in order to achieve a complete modulation of @xmath8 , @xmath56 must vary between 0 and @xmath198 .",
    "this can be obtained by using a radio frequency superconducting quantum interference device ( rf squid ) , but this would again require the use of a clean contact between the s@xmath7is@xmath6 junction and a third superconductor s@xmath79 ( with @xmath188 ) in order to suppress heat losses.@xcite a good alternative is represented by an asymmetric direct current squid formed by different josephson junctions ( jjs ) , of which one corresponds to the s@xmath7is@xmath6 junction .",
    "the latter can be biased up to @xmath63 if its josephson inductance@xcite is the largest in the squid , i.e. , its josephson critical current is much lower than those of the other jjs .    as done in previous cases",
    ", we can now write and solve the energy - balance equations accounting for the thermal budget in every electrode of the chain .",
    "thus , we can obtain the behavior of the thermal diode vs. @xmath10 , @xmath78 and @xmath56 for different values of the parameters .",
    "figure [ fig5](b ) shows @xmath8 vs. @xmath10 for different values of the cold finger resistance @xmath162 at @xmath133 mk .",
    "solid lines represent the rectification efficiency for @xmath75 , while dashed lines stand for that obtained in the case of @xmath63 .",
    "the values of @xmath8 provided here are comparable to those obtained with the ninisin chain , but the phase dependence of @xmath199 represents an additional ingredient that strongly influences the performance of the diode over a large part of the @xmath10 range . in particular , for @xmath163 k@xmath82 we can reach a maximum relative variation @xmath200/\\mathcal{r}(0)\\simeq 77$]% at @xmath201 k. from the point of view of output temperatures , though , the phase tuning of the device is clearly detectable only for @xmath202 k. the effect of the phase biasing is especially visible on @xmath109 , which is affected by a maximum variation of @xmath203 60 mk at @xmath204 0.6 k. at this temperature also the phase modulation of @xmath180 exhibits the largest amplitude ( of @xmath205 mk ) , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig5](d ) .",
    "we finally notice that the global efficiency of a n@xmath6in@xmath7is@xmath7is@xmath6in@xmath79 chain is comparable to those of other chain diodes , with a maximum @xmath137_{\\rm max } \\sim 6 $ ] for @xmath206 k@xmath82 .",
    "in summary , we first reviewed the intrinsic properties of superconducting hybrid junctions as thermal rectifiers .",
    "nis and s@xmath6is@xmath7 junctions can reach an optimal rectification efficiency of @xmath207@xcite and @xmath208,@xcite respectively . on the other hand , even though a simple nin junction can not provide heat rectification , it is possible to obtain @xmath32 as high as 3000 by realizing an asymmetric ninin chain with the central island coupled to the phonon bath by means of a cold finger .",
    "the latter provides an efficient channel through which the diode can release energy in the non - transmissive temperature bias configuration.@xcite this design can be used also in a ninisin chain , which offers the opportunity to boost the performance of a single nis junction and to overcome the fabrication complexity imposed by the high resistance asymmetry required in a ninin chain .",
    "the superconducting energy gap plays the role of a thermal bottleneck at low temperatures , while for higher temperatures it can generate an inversion of the rectification regime , as experimentally proven in ref . .",
    "finally , we analyzed a ninis@xmath7is@xmath6 in chain as a testing ground for the experimental demonstration of a phase - tunable thermal diode , providing a larger rectification efficiency and requiring lower bias temperatures with respect to those obtained in previous theoretical proposals.@xcite these thermal rectifiers could be easily implemented by standard nanofabrication techniques @xcite and , combined with heat current interferometers , @xcite might become building blocks of coherent caloritronic nanocircuits.@xcite moreover , they could be connected to electronic coolers and radiation detectors,@xcite offering the possibility to evacuate dissipated power in an unidirectional way .",
    "finally , this technology might also have a potential impact in general - purpose cryogenic electronic microcircuitry , e.g. , solid - state quantum information architectures.@xcite",
