    "relativistic hydrodynamics has various applications , including the calculations of single - particle spectra and two - particle correlations in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "the applications of relativistic hydrodynamics in the field of heavy ion physics have been reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "more recently , there has been an increasing interest in studying rhic and coming lhc experiments in the framework of relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamical analysis can also be extended to the study of these processes on event - by - event basis @xcite .",
    "however , most works in hydrodynamics are numerical so not always transparent . in this sense",
    ", exact solutions would be useful , but are rarely found due to the highly non - linear nature of relativistic hydrodynamics . actually , landau s one - dimensional analytical solution of relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite gave rise to a new approach in high energy physics .",
    "the boost - invariant bjorken solution @xcite , found more than 20 years later , is frequently utilized as the basis for estimations of initial energy densities in ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "recently , bir has found self - similar exact solutions of relativistic hydrodynamics for cylindrically expanding systems @xcite , however , his solutions are valid only when the pressure is independent of space and time , as e.g. in the case of a rehadronization phase transition in the middle of a relativistic heavy ion collision .",
    "here we present an analytic approach , which goes back to the data - motivated exact analytic solution of non - relativistic hydrodynamics found by zimnyi , bondorf and garpman ( zbg ) in 1978 for low energy heavy ion collisions with spherical symmetry  @xcite .",
    "this solution has been extended to the case of elliptic symmetry by zimnyi and collaborators in  @xcite . in  @xcite a gaussian parameterization has been introduced to describe the mass dependence of the effective temperature and the radius parameters of the two - particle bose - einstein correlation functions in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "later it has been realized that this phenomenological _ parameterization _ of data corresponds to an exact , gaussian _",
    "solution _ of non - relativistic hydrodynamics with spherical symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the spherically symmetric self - similar solutions of non - relativistic hydrodynamics were obtained in a general manner in  @xcite , that included an arbitrary scaling function for the temperature profile , and expressed the density distribution in terms of the temperature profile function . the zbg solution and the gaussian solution of  @xcite",
    "are recovered from the general solution of  @xcite as special cases , corresponding to different scaling functions of the temperature profile .",
    "the gaussian solution has been generalized to ellipsoidal expansions in  @xcite , that provides analytic insight into the physics of non - central heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "our approach corresponds to a relativistic generalization of these recently obtained analytic solutions  @xcite of non - relativistic fireball hydrodynamics to the case of relativistic flows , based on the success of the analytic approach to parameterize the single particle spectra and the two - particle bose - einstein correlations in high energy heavy ion physics in terms of hydrodynamically expanding sources  @xcite .    in particular ,",
    "we attempt here to solve the 1 + 1 dimensional relativistic hydrodynamical problem , in trying to overcome two shortcomings of bjorken s well - known solution .",
    "these two shortcomings of bjorken s solutions are that _",
    "i ) _ it only describes ultra - relativistic limit so that the rapidity distribution is flat ; _ ii ) _ it contains no transverse flow .    here",
    "we present a new family of exact analytic solutions of relativistic hydrodynamics in 1 + 1 dimension ( time + longitudinal coordinate ) , that is able to describe arbitrary inhomogeneous rapidity distributions .",
    "the inclusion of the transverse flow will be treated in a subsequent paper .",
    "an interesting aspect of this solution is that the shapes of the rapidity distribution @xmath0 and temperature distribution are coupled in the way that the larger the rapidity density , the smaller the effective temperature .",
    "choosing the effective temperature distribution @xmath1 to be flat , we recover bjorken s 1 + 1 dimensional solution .",
    "in order to get solutions that have simple non - relativistic limiting behavior , we consider a gas of one type of particles whose total number is conserved .",
    "we then solve the relativistic continuity and energy - momentum conservation equation : @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the number density , the four - velocity is denoted by @xmath4 , normalized to @xmath5 , and the energy - momentum tensor is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "we assume perfect fluid , @xmath7 where @xmath8 stands for the relativistic energy density and @xmath9 denotes the pressure .",
    "we close this set of relativistic hydrodynamical equations with the use of an equation of state .",
    "we assume an ideal gas that contains massive conserved quanta , @xmath10 this equation of state has two free parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the case of ultrarelativistic gas is recovered by choosing @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "if the thermal motion of the gas is non - relativistic , one has @xmath15 . using this condition ,",
    "the equations of non - relativistic hydrodynamics are re - obtained from the above set of equations in the @xmath16 limiting case .",
    "the non - relativistic ideal gas equation of state corresponds to the case of @xmath17 .",
    "the energy - momentum conservation equation contains 4 independent equations .",
    "these can be projected into a component parallel to @xmath18 and a component orthogonal to @xmath18 , that yield the relativistic energy and euler equations : @xmath19 the relativistic euler equation contains only three independent components , by construction .    using the equation of state and the continuity equation ,",
    "the energy equation can be rewritten as an equation for the temperature , @xmath20    from now on we assume that the flow is homogeneous in the transverse direction corresponding to infinitely broad target and projectile in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "we reduce our equations to the 1 + 1 dimensional case , so the coordinates are @xmath21 , @xmath22 and the metric tensor is @xmath23 .",
    "we solve 3 independent equations , the continuity , the temperature equation and the @xmath24 component of the euler equation  ( [ e : cont],[e : reu],[e : rt ] ) . the equations , ( [ e : eos1],[e : eos2 ] ) close this system of equations in terms of 3 variables , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we search for solutions that scale in the @xmath24 direction .",
    "we introduce the time dependent scaling variable @xmath28 and assume that the longitudinal motion corresponds to a hubble type of self - similar longitudinal expansion , @xmath29 where @xmath30 stands for the time derivative of the scale parameter @xmath31 . in a relativistic notation ,",
    "this form is equivalent to @xmath32 using this ansatz , we find that the continuity equation is solved by the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an arbitrary non - negative function of the scaling variable @xmath35 and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are normalization constants .",
    "we use the convention @xmath38 and @xmath39 which implies that @xmath40 .",
    "the temperature equation , ( [ e : rt ] ) is solved by the following form : @xmath41 the constants of normalization are chosen such that @xmath42 and @xmath43 . here again , we find that the solution is independent of the form of the function @xmath44 , provided that @xmath45 .",
    "using the ansatz for the flow profile and the solution for the density and the temperature , the relativistic euler equation reduces to a complicated non - linear equation that contains @xmath31 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 and @xmath35 . taking this equation at @xmath48 we express @xmath47 as a function of @xmath31 and @xmath46 . substituting this back to the euler equation we obtain an equation for @xmath49 and @xmath35 . in particular , for the @xmath13 case , @xmath31 cancels out and this reduces to a second order polynomial equation for @xmath50 , which has only one positive root .",
    "the form of the solution in this case ( @xmath13 ) is @xmath51 observing that the function @xmath52 depends only on the scaling variable @xmath35 , while @xmath46 depends only on the time variable @xmath53 , we conclude that the only solution of this equation should be a constant @xmath54 now we choose the origin of the time axis such that @xmath55 without loss of generality .",
    "the solutions can be cast in a relatively simple form by introducing the longitudinal proper time @xmath56 and the space - time rapidity @xmath57 defined as @xmath58 this implies that @xmath59 thus the solution for the flow velocity field corresponds to the flow field of the bjorken solution .",
    "however , in the bjorken solution the temperature distribution was independent of the @xmath57 variable , while in our case the density and the temperature distributions can be both @xmath57 dependent , or in other words , our solutions are scale dependent .",
    "the scale is defined by the parameter @xmath60 , in the longitudinal direction .",
    "this special form of the solution for the flow velocity field implies that @xmath61 .",
    "this equation implies that there is no pressure gradient and there is no acceleration in this class of self - similar solutions .",
    "the euler equation is reduced to the following requirement : @xmath62   = 0\\ ] ] this equation is solved by the trivial @xmath63 as well as by the non - trivial solution of @xmath64 which is indeed only a function of @xmath35 as @xmath65 is a constant of time . with this form , the euler equation is satisfied .",
    "this solution implies that the scaling profile functions for the temperature and the density distribution are not independent . as the constraint is given only for their product , one of them can be still chosen in an arbitrary manner .    at this point",
    "it is worthwhile to introduce new forms of the scaling functions .",
    "let us define @xmath66 then the constraint eq.([e : nt ] ) can be cast to the simplest form of @xmath67    let us summarize our new family of solutions of the 1 + 1 dimensional relativistic hydrodynamics by substituting the results in the density , temperature and pressure profiles .",
    "we obtain @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "this implies that we have generated a new family of exact solutions of relativistic hydrodynamics : a new hydrodynamical solution is assigned to each non - negative function @xmath70 .",
    "it can be checked that the above solutions are valid also for massive particles , the form of the solution is independent of the value of the mass @xmath11 .",
    "the form of solutions depends parametrically on @xmath12 , that characterizes the equation of state .",
    "we have obtained new solutions of the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional relativistic hydrodynamical equations which describe a self - similar , streaming flow . the pressure and the flow profiles are the same as in the 1 + 1 dimensional bjorken solution . in the case of @xmath71",
    "we recover bjorken s solution . in this limiting case , the pressure , the density and the temperature profiles depend only on the longitudinal proper time @xmath56 .    in the general case",
    ", our solution contains a characteristic scale defining parameter in the longitudinal direction , @xmath60 , and an arbitrary scaling function @xmath72 .",
    "thus we have an infinitely rich new family of solutions .",
    "let us try to determine the physical meaning of the scaling function @xmath72 .",
    "in order to do this we evaluate the single particle spectra corresponding to the new solutions . here",
    "we neglect any possible dynamics in the transverse directions , as usual in case of applications of bjorken s solution .",
    "the four - velocity field of our solutions thus becomes @xmath73 .",
    "the four - momentum of the observed particles with mass @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "let us assume that particles freeze out at a constant longitudinal proper - time @xmath77 , for the sake of simplicity .",
    "this implies freeze - out at a constant pressure , but at a space - time rapidity dependent temperature and density , and makes it possible to continue the calculation analytically .",
    "the source function of locally thermalized relativistically flowing particles in a boltzmann approximation can be written as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is an @xmath57 dependent normalization factor , given by the condition that @xmath80 , which implies that c ( ) = \\{4m^2 t(_f , ) k_2[m",
    "/ t(_f,)]}^-1 , where @xmath81 is the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "the single particle spectrum can be calculated from the emission function as @xmath82    substituting our family of new solutions , and using @xmath83 , we obtain the following form @xmath84   \\delta(\\tau-\\tau_{f}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we are interested in the coupling between the measurable rapidity distribution and the rapidity dependence of the effective temperature in the transverse directions as obtained from our new family of solutions .",
    "we assume that @xmath72 is a slowly varying function , i.e. @xmath85 in the region of interest .",
    "this assumption implies that the point of maximal emissivity is located at @xmath86 with correction terms of @xmath87 the measurable single - particle spectra can be written as @xmath88,\\\\ \\frac{dn}{dy }   & = & n_{0}t_{0 } \\mathcal{v}\\left ( \\frac{\\tanh^{2}y}{\\dot{z}_{0}^{2}}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{e : dndy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where + @xmath89    note that the @xmath90 function is a free fit function that describes the measurable rapidity distribution , including characteristic scales of the size of @xmath60 .",
    "we see that the slope parameter for transverse mass distribution @xmath91 is related to the rapidity distribution as@xmath92    figures 1 and 2 illustrate the calculated behavior of the effective temperature distribution as a function of rapidity for a single gaussian - like and a double gaussian - like ansatz for the measurable rapidity distribution . in case of a homogeneous rapidity distribution , @xmath93 we recover bjorken s result that the effective temperature distribution is rapidity independent . this behavior is expected to appear in high energy heavy ion collisions in the infinite bombarding energy limit .",
    "we have found a new family of solutions of ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional relativistic hydrodynamics . this family solves the continuity equation and the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid , assuming an ideal gas equation of state .",
    "the flow field coincides with that of bjorken s solution .",
    "however , the shape of the measurable rapidity distribution , @xmath0 plays the role of an arbitrary scaling function in our solution , and we obtain that the effective temperature of the transverse momentum distribution becomes rapidity dependent .",
    "assuming that @xmath0 is a slowly varying function of the rapidity @xmath94 , we find that the effective temperature is proportional to the inverse of the rapidity distribution , @xmath95 .",
    "as compared to the well - known bjorken s solution , we have solved one more equation , the continuity equation .",
    "we have considered equations of state that have two free parameters , the mass @xmath11 and @xmath96 .",
    "interestingly , these generalizations resulted in _ additional freedom _ in the solution .",
    "our solution , similarly to bjorken s case , describes scaling longitudinal flow and a pressure distribution that depends only on the longitudinal proper time .",
    "however , in our case , the pressure is a product of the local number density and the local temperature , hence one of these can be chosen in an arbitrary manner . in principle , we obtained that the measured single particle rapidity distribution can be arbitrary , and this measurable distribution plays the role of a _ scaling function _ of both the density and the inverse temperature in this family of new solutions of relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "a generalization of the present one dimensional solution to 3 dimensional case can also be done in a similar manner to the nonrelativistic case@xcite .",
