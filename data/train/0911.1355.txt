    "supermassive black holes ( smbh ) , with masses between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are found at the center of nearly every galaxy where there have been sensitive searches .",
    "while we suspect that the seeds for these smbh might all have a common origin , their formation mechanism is not well understood .",
    "many galaxies at redshifts @xmath6 contain quasars , i.e. , smbh in the midst of luminous accretion .",
    "the soltan argument @xcite suggests black hole masses are largely accounted for via growth due to luminous accretion .",
    "there are far fewer quasars at low redshift @xcite , implying that at some point , smbh cease their luminous accretion .",
    "the quasar _ turnoff _",
    "mechanism is not well understood ( thacker et al .",
    "finally , the black hole mass - stellar velocity ( @xmath7 ) relation @xcite suggests that smbh are in some way co - evolving with their host galaxies , but the @xmath7 relation merely describes an end state and is not a theoretical explanation .    as we know of no rapid process by which smbh can lose mass , the evolutionary tracks for smbh consist of stages at progressively higher masses .",
    "these stages must , in order , involve ( 1 ) a formation mechanism , ( 2 ) a period of luminous growth ( the ` quasar phase ' ) , perhaps along with a period of nonluminous growth ( ` turnoff ' ) , and ( 3 ) a period in which smbh lie at the centers of galaxies without substantial growth , as we observe them today .",
    "much current theoretical research concerns the origin and turnoff phases of quasar evolution , while the ` quasar phase ' appears to be relatively well understood .    in this paper",
    "we find a new feature of smbh evolution during their quasar phase .",
    "we examine the evolution of the quasar locus in mass - luminosity space as a function of redshift .",
    "the @xmath8 locus is traditionally shown with all quasars on the same plot ( as in figure [ fig : allml ] ) .",
    "the large size of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr5 quasar catalogue @xcite allows a subdivision into several redshift bins , each containing thousands of quasars .",
    "the eddington limit produces an absolute upper bound on the luminosity of quasars which is proportional to the black hole mass , @xmath9 @xcite . while strictly applicable only for a spherical accretion flow of ionized gas , models for more realistic accretion configurations with rotation are still limited by a luminosity of this order ( except under special circumstances , e.g. begelman 2002 ) . using a smaller data set ( @xmath10 ) than sdss , kollmeier et al .",
    "( 2006 ) appeared to confirm the applicability of @xmath11 to quasars , using an @xmath8 locus ( similar to figure [ fig : allml ] ) to show that the most luminous quasars reach but do not exceed @xmath12 .",
    "for the lowest black - hole masses at every redshift , we confirm the conclusion of @xcite , but we show that the quasars with the highest smbh mass at every redshift fall well short of @xmath11 .    in   [ sec : methods ] , we review the methods used to estimate masses and bolometric luminosities .",
    "while we have added nothing original to this methodology , the remainder of our results are entirely dependent upon its accuracy . in   [",
    "sec : lm ] , we subdivide the sdss dr5 quasar catalogue by redshift and show that the quasar mass - luminosity distribution does not match what we should expect given our current theoretical understanding of quasar accretion .",
    "in particular , we show that instead a sub - eddington boundary ( seb ) is present in each redshift bin .",
    "we also use our limited statistics to make a first estimate for how the seb evolves with redshift . in   [ sec : tests ] , we consider several alternative explanations for the discrepancies between the observed quasar locus and the eddington luminosity , focusing on potential sources of measurement uncertainty or bias . in   [ sec : discussion ] , we comment on the potential implications of our new results .",
    "the remainder of this work relies upon an ability to accurately estimate the bolometric luminosities and central black hole masses of quasars at cosmological redshifts .",
    "the primary results in this work are drawn from the shen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) virial mass catalogue for sdss dr5 @xcite quasars .",
    "the luminosity determination is fairly straightforward and uses the relatively settled techniques discussed in richards et al .",
    "the mass determination , on the other hand , uses relatively new techniques , and has a larger uncertainty .",
    "therefore , we review here the basic assumptions in virial mass estimation .",
    "potential sources of error or bias in the shen et al .",
    "virial masses are discussed in more detail in ",
    "[ sec : tests ]    the determination of black hole masses from spectral emission lines relies upon two basic assumptions : ( 1 ) that the orbital velocity of gas in the broad - line region ( blr ) is dominated by the virial velocity due to the central black hole and ( 2 ) that there is a scaling relationship between luminosity and radius . as a result of ( 1 ) , we can calculate the mass @xmath13 of the black hole from emission lines in the blr as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the radius and @xmath16 the velocity of gas emitting the blr spectral lines .",
    "marconi et al . ( 2009 ) suggest corrections to the virial approximation for radiation pressure might be needed at high luminosity , particularly when using civ lines to determine @xmath16 .",
    "this first scaling relationship is based upon black hole masses determined using reverberation mapping , which uses the time delay between variability in the continuum and emission lines to determine @xmath15 ( cf . peterson & horne 2004 ) .",
    "virial mass estimates also require assumption ( 2 ) , an empirical scaling relationship very close to the @xmath17 that we would expect for a black body @xcite , although thermal processes in the accretion disc are likely to be substantially more complex .",
    "this second assumption transforms ( [ eq : virial ] ) into a scaling relation of the form @xmath18 \\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where fwhm is the full width at half - maximum of the corresponding line profile , @xmath19 is the luminosity per unit wavelength at rest - frame wavelength @xmath20 , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constants .",
    "vestergaard & peterson ( 2006 ) determined these constants in black hole mass scaling relations based on h@xmath0 and civ emission lines ( vp06 ) , while mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) and mclure & dunlop ( 2004 ) developed a mass relation ( md04 ) by scaling mgii - based estimates against h@xmath0-based estimates .",
    "the scaling relations used in this work are summarized in table [ table : vmesummary ] .",
    "multiple scaling relations are required because sdss spectra only cover the range 39009100  , so that none of these three blr emission lines are accessible over the entire redshift range of the sdss catalogue .",
    "the additive constants @xmath23 are determined by calibrating virial mass scaling relationships against other methods for black hole mass estimation as part of a ` black hole mass ladder'@xcite .",
    "direct estimates based upon local stellar and gas kinematics ( cf .",
    "ferrarese & ford 2005 provide our best estimates for nearby black holes .",
    "reverberation mapping is calibrated against these estimates , and the virial mass scaling relations are in turn calibrated against reverberation mapping .",
    "these calibrations use very few quasars compared to the 62,185 in the shen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) sample : only 28 quasars are used to calibrate the h@xmath0 and 27 to calibrate the civ scaling relations@xcite .",
    ".summary of the virial mass estimates used [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : tests ]    a large , unknown systematic error in virial @xmath24 measurements is the most plausible explanation by comparison for how the seb might be produced without additional underlying physics , but requires that virial mass estimates are @xmath25 dex incorrect , reverberation mapping is @xmath25 dex incorrect , and that quasars at low redshift lie within a spread of just 1.3 decades of central black hole mass .",
    "it would appear likely that the explanation for these new limits lies in new theory rather than observational errors .",
    "quasar catalogues such as the sloan digital sky survey are now large enough to yield useful statistical conclusions after being subdivided . in this work ,",
    "we have explored just a few of the many ways in which the catalogue might be divided .",
    "it is immediately apparent that when the quasar distribution is considered at any given redshift , the most massive central black holes do not accrete at their eddington luminosity , but rather all fall well short of @xmath26 . while there are many measurements that contribute to these quasar distributions , each with its own set of assumptions , a close examination reveals no evidence that any these are responsible for massive quasars remaining sub - eddington .",
    "rather , it appears that this ` sub - eddington boundary ' is a new physical limit for quasars .",
    "thus , quasar accretion must be more complicated than had been previously thought .",
    "the sub - eddington boundary helps to recast the problem in a two - dimensional form .",
    "this form emphasizes the luminosity as being a function of the mass and accretion rate , fundamental properties of the quasar , in a non - trivial way .",
    "quasar luminosity functions and quasar mass functions are both one - dimensional projections of the mass - luminosity plane .",
    "the full two - dimensional quasar distribution contains complexities difficult to discern from either of these projections .",
    "the sub - eddington boundary presents a theoretical puzzle .",
    "not only must an improved theory explain the sub - eddington boundary , but it must also explain its detailed shape and explain the evolution of that shape with redshift . while the slope of the sub - eddington boundary may not vary greatly with redshift ,",
    "the mass scale at which the boundary becomes relevant is larger at higher redshift .",
    "the results in this paper can be used to develop a series of tests which should be capable of discriminating between models .    given the complications introduced by the sub - eddington boundary , the case could be made that we really understand surprisingly little about the supermassive black holes that appear to be at the center of nearly every galaxy . not only is their seeding mechanism unknown , but as shown in this paper , the growth mechanism is quite poorly understood , contrary to expectations .",
    "the eddington limit is relevant at low black hole masses , but is only part of the story .",
    "the sub - eddington boundary developed in this work is the latest addition to a growing collection of puzzles regarding every phase of the evolution of galactic nuclei and surrounding regions .",
    "the authors would like to thank mihail amarie , forrest collman , doug finkbeiner , margaret geller , lars hernquist , gillian knapp , avi loeb , ramesh narayan , jerry ostriker , and michael strauss for valuable comments .",
