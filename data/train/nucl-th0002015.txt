    "recently data on @xmath3 annihilations on light nuclei ( h , d and @xmath4he ) have become available at very small @xmath3 momenta ( down to 45 mev / c)@xcite .",
    "a new data on @xmath5ne at 57 mev / c is also available now@xcite .",
    "together with previously available data ( for a review see e.g. ref.@xcite ) , and with data on antiprotonic atoms@xcite , the full set presents some interesting features , that we will try and correlate in this work . as far as a qualitative physical understanding",
    "is concerned , the unifying feature is a mechanism that we call `` inversion '' , i.e. a repulsion - dominated low energy @xmath0 interaction . from a practical point of view , we will widely rely on the possibility of reproducing the available elastic and annihilation @xmath0 data below 600 mev / c via an energy independent optical potential .",
    "let us initially discuss some relevant points of the phenomenology :    \\1 ) annihilation @xmath0 data show , in a log - log plot , a series of roughly rectilinear behaviors ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "these can be approximately identified with regions where different angular momentum components are dominant , with the s - p transition at about 100 mev / c . at 50 mev / c",
    "it is possible to assume s - wave dominance and estimate the imaginary part of the scattering length @xmath6@xcite .",
    "the real part , is extracted from the widths and shifts of the levels of antiprotonic hydrogen atoms@xcite , together with an independent measure of @xmath7 .",
    "elastic @xmath0 data at values of the laboratory @xmath3 momentum @xmath8 in the 200 - 500 mev / c range were reproduced by brckner @xmath9 @xmath10@xcite with a phenomenological optical potential .",
    "these authors left a wide range of uncertainty for the suggested potential parameters .",
    "we have noticed that the same potential , with a finer tuning of the parameters , can fit all the annihilation data which have been later measured at smaller @xmath8 , down to 30 mev / c , by the obelix collaboration@xcite ( see fig.2 , and section 3 for details ) .",
    "it can also calculate the real and imaginary parts of the scattering length .",
    "optical potential analysis , partial wave analysis and atomic data agree on @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath12 0.7@xmath140.8 fm , with positive sign .",
    "\\2 ) the @xmath15 parameter , i.e. the ratio between the real and imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude , can be measured at zero or near zero energy exploiting @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 , which means @xmath15 @xmath12 @xmath19 . at larger energy ,",
    "it must be extracted by a @xmath20 delicate ( and partly model dependent ) analysis of the elastic @xmath0 angular distributions . despite the behavior of @xmath15",
    "is still unclear in the region 100 - 200 mev / c@xcite , an overview of the experimental data@xcite suggest that @xmath15 is small but positive ( 0.1@xmath140.3 ) at projectile momenta over some value which lies somewhere around 500 mev / c , smaller ( with uncertain sign ) in the region 180 - 500 mev / c , and tends to some negative value @xmath21 @xmath19 at zero energy . as better",
    "described in the following , we have applied the optical potential ( whose parameters have been fine - tuned on the @xmath0 annihilation data at 30 - 100 mev / c ) , to predict the @xmath15 behavior .",
    "the results agree with the large and the zero energy data , and suggest that @xmath15 varies monotonously in the less known intermediate momentum region ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "\\3 ) in the laboratory frame @xmath3 total annihilation cross sections ( tpa from now on ) on deuteron and @xmath4he are almost equal , and both are smaller than tpa on hydrogen .",
    "the @xmath5ne datum is larger , but not so large as one could expect@xcite .",
    "see fig.1 for a general view of the data",
    ". taking into account that a large enhance of reaction cross sections is predicted at low energies because of charge effects@xcite , this phenomenon is surprising .",
    "according with the notations used in previous works@xcite we will call this behavior `` inversion '' . actually , if the data are represented in the center of mass frame , tpa on d and @xmath4he are slightly larger than tpa on hydrogen , however the dependence of the tpa on the mass number is still much smaller than any geometrical expectance ( see later for a discussion of the `` geometrical expectance '' and of the role of the center of mass ) . for @xmath8 @xmath22 100",
    "mev / c this phenomenon is not observed and the ratio between @xmath0 and @xmath23he annihilation rates is qualitatively what one would expect . the inversion behavior is confirmed by an analysis of antiprotonic atoms@xcite , where it is found that @xmath24 is smaller in antiprotonic deuterium than in antiprotonic hydrogen .",
    "\\4 ) from an overview of the available @xmath25@xcite and @xmath26@xcite annihilation data below 600 mev / c it appears that : ( i ) where many partial waves dominate the @xmath2nucleus interaction the cross sections relative to different nuclear species are parallel , and agree with a law @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "( ii ) where only a few partial waves are supposed to dominate , a convergency ( for decreasing energies ) between the different tpa is clearly visible . in a log - log plot ,",
    "the extrapolations of the different tpa seem to aim at some common intersection point somewhere at @xmath30 @xmath21 1 mev / c ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "to better understand the significance of the previous nuclear data some considerations are useful .",
    "both the `` inversion '' and the convergency behavior contraddict the geometrical predictions . assuming that the imaginary part of the scattering length is roughly equal to the nuclear size @xmath31",
    "@xmath12 1.3@xmath32 fm , and exploiting the traditional estimation of the coulomb focusing effect@xcite , one has tpa @xmath21 @xmath33 at very small momenta . at larger momenta",
    "the semiclassical expectance is tpa @xmath28 @xmath34 ( well verified for @xmath3@xcite and @xmath35@xcite annihilations at any @xmath36 @xmath37 180",
    "mev / c ) . since for most nuclei @xmath38",
    "@xmath12 @xmath39 , one should naively expect that tpa on different nuclei increase their separation when momenta decrease below 100 mev / c , while exactly the opposite in seen .",
    "in addition , at any precise lab or c.m . momentum below @xmath36 @xmath17 100 mev / c , the @xmath40dependence of the known tpa is below both the @xmath34 and the @xmath38 prediction .    regarding the question whether the tpa on different nuclei must be compared at the same laboratory or center of mass momenta , the answer is model - dependent . in impulse approximation inspired models ,",
    "the annihilation process only involves one of the nucleons in the target nucleus , which has average momentum equal to zero in the laboratory .",
    "it is then reasonable to compare data at the same laboratory momentum . in compound - nucleus",
    "inspired models , the collision process directly transfers momentum from the projectile to the full target . in this case , data taken on different targets should be compared at the same c.m . momentum .",
    "the key point is the generalization of the concept of low energy `` inversion '' . on the ground of general quantum principles",
    "it is possible to demonstrate@xcite that , in presence of a @xmath20 effective esothermic hadronic reaction mechanism and in conditions of s - wave dominance : ( i ) the reaction cross section must stay much below geometrical expectations , and is largely independent on the target nucleus size ; ( ii ) most attempts to increase those model parameters which supposedly should enhance the annihilation rate ( e.g. strength or radius of a potential ) lead to the opposite or to no result ; ( iii ) a strong non - diffractive elastic scattering accompanies the reaction at low energies , and this scattering has @xmath41 character ( i.e. @xmath11 @xmath37 0 ) .",
    "so , with `` inversion '' we will refer to the presence of these three features .",
    "we have previously demonstrated@xcite that strong inversion must be expected whenever disappearance of the projectile s - wave wavefunction @xmath42 ( at the nuclear surface ) is produced within a range much smaller than @xmath43 @xmath12 1 fm .",
    "then , regularity conditions on @xmath42 at the nuclear surface necessarily produce a large flux reflection and a @xmath42 which is similar to the one produced by a repulsive potential with little absorbtion .",
    "for this reason it is not proper to consider the scattered flux as `` diffractive '' , although it is a by - product of absorbtion .",
    "it is a refractive process , as in elastic potential scattering .",
    "now we can better specify the above required condition of `` very effective reaction mechanism '' ( since at low energies it is not so effective ) : it means that ( i ) the reaction is esothermic , ( ii ) it produces large reaction rates at large energies , ( iii ) at any energy its free mean path in nuclear matter can be estimated to be shorter than 1 fm .",
    "we remark that the described behavior is experimentally confirmed by the fact that for the @xmath0 scattering length @xmath6 we have @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath37 0 , or equivalently @xmath16 @xmath12 @xmath19 . and by the fact that @xmath3 annihilation rates on nuclei are not that large",
    ".    also the traditional view of the coulomb focusing effect must be reconsidered . in a previous paper@xcite",
    "we have already calculated and compared `` charged '' and `` uncharged '' annihilation rates on nuclei with finite size , and demonstrated that the traditional @xmath44 coulomb enhancement factor@xcite is exagerated .",
    "this factor is estimated with the two assumptions : ( i ) pointlike target ( ii ) completely independent action of coulomb and strong forces . on the contrary , on one side",
    "the interplay between coulomb and strong forces is not negligible , and on the other side finite size effects largely neutralize the coulomb enhancement factor for intermediate and heavy nuclear targets .",
    "e.g. , speaking in terms of target effective charge @xmath45 , we have @xmath46 @xmath12 1 ( instead of 2 ) , @xmath47 @xmath12 2 ( instead of 5 ; comparisons are performed at the same laboratory momentum , but center of mass effects were included in the calculation@xcite ) .",
    "as previously anticipated , all the data on @xmath0 elastic and annihilation cross section below 600 mev / c can be reasonably well fitted by the same potential , with woods - saxon shape , used by brckner @xmath9 @xmath10@xcite to fit elastic @xmath0 data at 181 , 287 and 505 mev / c , after a finer tuning of the parameters .",
    "we have set the real and imaginary strength to -46 and -8000 mev , the real and imaginary radius to 1.89 and 0.41 fm , and the diffuseness to the common value 0.2 fm .",
    "the fit on the annihilations is very good below 300 mev / c and good within 10 % at 600 mev / c ( the exact precision over 300 mev / c depends on which set of data is chosen@xcite ) , and the elastic distributions are still well reproduced .",
    "the total potential includes the coulomb potential of a spherical charge distribution with radius 1.25 fm . in all the calculations center of mass corrections",
    "have been included .",
    "together with the outcome of the above potential , in fig.2 we also show a curve corresponding to imaginary strength 1000 mev . for both cases ( strength 8000 and 1000 mev )",
    "we also show the s- and p - wave contributions .",
    "evidently the used potential does produce `` inversion '' , i.e. a larger annihilation potential produces a smaller annihilation rate . from the same figure it is obvious that this behavior is associated with the s - wave dominance , and is present only below an `` inversion point '' @xmath48 . in this case @xmath48",
    "@xmath12 200 mev / c .    in fig.3",
    "we show the value of @xmath15 in the momentum range 0 - 600 mev / c calculated with this potential .",
    "the change of sign of @xmath15 can be related with the transition from the dominance of the reaction - associated repulsion to the dominance of the direct potential attraction , at least in forward scattering .",
    "indeed , at increasing momenta the born approximation becomes progressively more reliable , and it permits to estimate @xmath15 @xmath21 @xmath49 @xmath21 @xmath500.2 , using as an effective radius the sum of the potential radius and diffuseness . the positive @xmath15 value at large momenta is thus directly due to the presence of a real attracting part in the potential .",
    "we notice that the `` source '' of the `` direct '' attraction will be the region where absolute value of the elastic potential is roughly equal to the kinetic energy , while the `` source '' of the reaction - induced repulsion will be the region where most annihilations take place , i.e. 0.5@xmath141 fm out of the edge of the annihilation core this distance has been estimated in past years in analysis of both @xmath0@xcite and @xmath2nucleus@xcite interactions .    in fig.4 the total annihilation and elastic cross sections",
    "are reported , compared with the corresponding cross sections calculated after turning off the electric charge . in the former case",
    "the contribution of the pure coulomb forward peak and of the coulomb - strong interference is excluded .",
    "nevertheless , the elastic strong cross section is largely affected by coulomb focusing effects .",
    "in particular , the figure shows that the ratio between the strong elastic and the annihilation total cross sections is completely dominated by the coulomb effects . without them ,",
    "@xmath51 @xmath52 0 for @xmath8 @xmath52 0 .",
    "with inclusion of the charge effect , approximately @xmath51 @xmath52 1/6 .",
    "we have also calculated angular distributions at momenta between 25 and 100 mev / c , but they are practically flat up to 50 mev / c , and at 100 mev / c present a 20% change between forward and backward scattering , so they are not very interesting . at 100 mev",
    "/ c the p - wave contributions are 1 % in the total strong elastic cross section , and 10% in the annihilation .",
    "we remark that at such small momenta the rutherford `` forward '' peak , which spreads at angles @xmath53 @xmath28 @xmath54 , becomes the most important source of elastic scattering at large angles too .",
    "up to now we did not succeed in fitting light nuclei data perfectly by energy - independent optical potentials ( which take nuclear density distributions into account ) . in fact , at momenta below 100 mev / c a certain energy dependence is introduced by the nontrivial energy dependence of the @xmath55 annihilation rate@xcite ) .",
    "the study of the nuclear optical potential requires taking into account nuclear structure details and @xmath55 interactions , so a more specific and longer work will be devoted to it in the next future .",
    "qualitatively , it is evident that the energy dependence of the cross sections in the range 30 - 200 mev / c is much slower in @xmath2nucleus than in @xmath0 .",
    "this can be related to the change of sign of @xmath15 in @xmath0 interactions observing that if the @xmath2nucleon interaction is repulsive below a certain momentum of scale @xmath21 100 mev / c , in a cluster of nucleons each single nucleon will contribute keeping the projectile far from itself and from all the other ones . in the language of the multiple scattering expansion",
    "this is an interference between single and double scattering processes , i.e. elastic scattering of @xmath3 on one nucleon prevents annihilation on another one .",
    "this interpretations would confirm the suggestion given by wycech @xmath9 @xmath10 in their analysis of antiprotonic deuterium@xcite : they estimate single and double scattering amplitudes contributing to the @xmath56 interaction , and observe that the interference between them decreases the single scattering output . at the same time our calculations ( still in progress ) show that , in the case of light nuclei , nuclear structure details and @xmath55 features do affect the results .",
    "we have shown that the obelix collaboration data on @xmath0 annihilation in the range 30 to 180 mev / c allow us for a finer tuning of the parameters of an optical potential , which was previously used by other authors to interpolate elastic differential cross sections at @xmath36 181 , 287 and 505 mev / c . without the need of introducing any energy dependence of these parameters ,",
    "the so - obtained potential can reproduce all the @xmath0 annihilation data between 30 and 600 mev / c , the zero - energy value of the @xmath15 parameter together with its general trend at increasing energies , and the measured values of the scattering length ( real and imaginary part ) with correct sign .",
    "we have also used this potential to predict elastic cross sections and @xmath15 values in those regions where data are not available yet .",
    "we have also shown that the behavior of all the considered observables is largely affected by a mechanism that we call `` inversion '' : in presence of a very strong reaction mechanism the reaction cross sections become anomalously small at very low energies , while elastic interactions reverse from attractive to repulsive .",
    "we ca nt make precise predictions for the @xmath2nucleus cross sections yet , but we stress that their smallness is closely related with the low - energy repulsive behavior of the @xmath0 interaction .",
