    "inclusive and semi  inclusive deep  inelastic scattering ( dis ) is and has been extensively used to study the internal structure of the nucleon .",
    "recent theoretical progress is mostly related to exclusive reactions and their description in terms of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) , also referred to as off  forward or skewed parton distributions @xcite .",
    "this theoretical framework takes into account the dynamical correlations between partons of different momenta in the nucleon .",
    "the well  known parton distribution functions and form factors turn out to be the limiting cases and moments of gpds . of particular interest",
    "is the second moment of two unpolarized quark gpds , which for the first time offers a possibility to determine the total angular momentum carried by the quark in the nucleon @xcite .",
    "very recent theoretical ideas indicate that gdps might be able to describe correlations between the longitudinal and transverse structure of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "the theoretically cleanest way to access gpds appears to be the deeply  virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) process , i.e. the hard exclusive leptoproduction of real photons with the target nucleon remaining intact .",
    "since the bethe  heitler ( bh ) process has an identical final state and therefore the amplitudes of both processes add coherently , the interference between them can be used to access the dvcs amplitudes . the leading  order and leading  twist interference term @xcite @xmath0\\ ] ] depends on the charge and the helicity of the incident lepton , where + ( - ) denotes a negatively ( positively ) charged lepton with polarization @xmath1 . note that terms suppressed by @xmath2 and involving higher @xmath3moments , were omitted in the above equation . here",
    "m represents the proton mass , t the square of the four  momentum transfer to the target , @xmath4 the virtual  photon four  momentum squared and @xmath5 is the polarization parameter of the virtual photon . measuring the dependence of certain cross section asymmetries on the azimuthal angle @xmath3 , defined as the angle between the lepton scattering plane and the photon production plane , provides information about the dvcs amplitude combination @xmath6 which can be expressed in terms of gpds .",
    "the extraction of an asymmetry with respect to the beam spin , accessing the imaginary part of @xmath6 , has already been carried out by the hermes experiment @xcite .",
    "the extraction of a beam  charge asymmetry , accessing the real part of @xmath6 , is described in the following .",
    "the data have been accumulated with the hermes spectrometer @xcite at desy during the 1998 ( 2000 ) running periods .",
    "the hera 27.6 gev electron ( positron ) beam was scattered off an unpolarized hydrogen gas target .",
    "events were selected if they contained exactly one photon and one charged track , identified as the scattered electron ( positron ) and fulfilling the kinematical requirements @xmath7  gev@xmath8 , @xmath9  gev@xmath8 and @xmath10  gev . here",
    "@xmath11 denotes the photon ",
    "nucleon invariant mass and @xmath12 is the virtual  photon energy .",
    "the angle between the real and the virtual photon was required to be within 15 and 70  mrad .      .",
    "the data correspond to the missing mass region between @xmath13  gev and @xmath14  gev .",
    "the solid line represents a @xmath15 fit to the data .",
    "the other curves are model calculations @xcite described in the text.,scaledwidth=60.0%,height=287 ]    in figure [ toll ] the azimuthal dependence of the extracted beam  charge asymmetry ( bca ) @xmath16 is shown , where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) represent the luminosity  normalized yields for the corresponding beam charges . using only events with a missing mass @xmath19 between -1.5  gev and + 1.7  gev",
    ", the data show the expected @xmath20behavior as can be seen by the solid line which represents a @xmath15 fit .",
    "the missing mass is defined as @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 being the four  momenta of the virtual photon , the target nucleon and the real photon , respectively .",
    "negative values of the missing mass are due to the finite momentum resolution of the spectrometer , in which case @xmath25 was defined . the beam used at hermes",
    "is polarized ; to minimize its effects , positron ( electron ) data sets were selected to have opposite polarizations @xmath1",
    "( @xmath26 ) to eliminate the @xmath27dependence in the numerator of equation ( [ bca ] ) .",
    "this dependence still exists in the denominator but should be negligible compared to the size of the bh amplitudes .",
    "the fit reveals a positive @xmath20 amplitude with a value of @xmath28 ( stat ) and an offset of @xmath29 ( stat ) .",
    "the latter value could possibly be related to a constant term in the interference , omitted in equation ( [ diehl ] ) since it appears at twist3 @xcite .",
    "however , the sign and the size of the amplitude might already contain some valuable information as can be seen by a comparison to model calculations @xcite which were carried out in a kinematic regime ( @xmath30 = 2.5  gev@xmath8 , @xmath31 = 0.11 , @xmath32 = -0.25  gev@xmath8 ) close to the hermes kinematics ( @xmath30 = 2.8  gev@xmath8 , @xmath31 = 0.12 , @xmath32 = -0.27  gev@xmath8 ) .",
    "the calculations are the same as described in reference @xcite .",
    "certain gpds are parameterized assuming that the t ",
    "dependent part factorizes , while the t ",
    "independent part is modelled by a two  component form , using the so  called double  distribution formalism @xcite completed by the d ",
    "term @xcite .",
    "term is related to the previously unstudied `` stress tensor '' of hadronic matter .",
    "it contributes to the real part of the dvcs amplitude only and therefore can be investigated with the bca for the first time . calculating the d ",
    "term contribution in the chiral quark soliton model results in the dashed ( twist2 ) and the dashed  dotted line ( twist3 ) in figure [ toll ] .",
    "the twist2 result without the additional d  term is represented by the dotted line .",
    "the long  spaced dashed line is the twist2 dvcs charge asymmetry when reversing the sign of the d  term .",
    "thus the preliminary hermes data already favor the existence of the d ",
    "term whereby , if it exists , the data clearly determine its sign . however , very recent calculations including twist3 effects , but using a different gpd model without d  term contribution describe the hermes data as well @xcite .        to be able to compare the result in the exclusive region with that in the non  exclusive region , the difference between the @xmath20weighted moments for either beam charge",
    ", @xmath33 is shown in figure [ toller ] versus the missing mass @xmath19 .",
    "as expected , the asymmetry appears to be non  zero only in the exclusive region , while in the non  exclusive region it is consistent with zero .",
    "the asymmetry given by this formula is not due to the real part of the dvcs amplitudes alone , but has a small modulation from the bh amplitudes .",
    "however , for this preliminary result this method is advantageous due to reduced systematic uncertainties .    in summary ,",
    "the beam  charge asymmetry in the hard electroproduction of real photons has been measured for the first time . a sizeable asymmetry of @xmath28  ( stat ) @xmath34  ( sys ) has been found in the exclusive region confirming the theoretical expectation .",
