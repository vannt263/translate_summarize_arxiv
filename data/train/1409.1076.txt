    "thin sheets with repetitive metallic inclusions or exclusions have been used extensively in the past in antenna applications to control the properties of reflected or transmitted power , e.g. its direction , phase , or polarization @xcite .",
    "such surfaces have received increasing attention lately , as part of the intensive research in the field of optical and microwave metamaterials , in an attempt to harness ideas from bulk metamterial explorations to design low - profile components with extraordinary wavefront manipulation capabilities @xcite .",
    "in contrast to bulk metamaterials , where subwavelength elements are combined to form a volumetric entity with prescribed local response to electromagnetic fields , in metamaterial sheets , or metasurfaces , these subwavelength atomic units are confined to a region with subwavelength thickness .",
    "this geometrical difference should decrease significantly fabrication complexity of metasurfaces and also loss - related problems ; however , it requires development of new design methodologies , as the interaction of electromagnetic fields with metasurfaces is naturally described via effective boundary conditions @xcite , as opposed to effective permeabilities and permittivities ( or effective wave equations ) , more suitable for modelling volumetric metamaterials @xcite .    in particular , it was recently recognized that as metasurfaces act as sources of tangential field discontinuities , they can be modelled by a distribution of electric and magnetic surface currents , prescribed by the equivalence principle [ , pp .",
    "575 - 579 ] .",
    "hence , in principle , for a given incident field , a desirable electromagnetic field distribution in space can be achieved by engineering the surface to induce currents that would produce the required tangential fields on both of its facets .    approximating the required continuous surface currents by a dense distribution of electric and magnetic dipoles",
    ", passive surfaces implementing plane - wave refraction were demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the elementary sources were formed by subwavelength inductive and capacitive elements that produced the suitable magnitudes of the current in response to the exciting incident plane - wave .",
    "simultaneously , it was demonstrated that also active elementary sources may be utilized to introduce desirable field discontinuities , e.g. , to implement a cloaking device based on the same equivalence principle @xcite . as these surfaces were composed of orthogonal electric and magnetic dipoles engineered to induce unidirectional radiation , i.e. acting as huygens sources [ , pp .",
    "653 - 660],@xcite , they were named huygens metasurfaces ( hms ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to plane - wave refraction and cloaking , recent reports proposed designs of huygens metasurfaces which implement beam shaping , transmission or reflection coefficient engineering and polarization manipulation ( using tensor huygens metasurfaces ) @xcite .",
    "although the design methodologies differ between the various authors , they all rely on the fact that if the dimensions of the unit cells and their spatial arrangement obey certain conditions , the metasurface can be modelled by effective electric and magnetic polarizability distributions , which are translated to position - dependent sheet boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "these , in turn , can be equivalently described as surface impedance and surface admittance matrices relating the electric and magnetic field components at the two facets of the metasurface @xcite .    following this approach",
    "greatly simplifies device design , as it facilitates the development of simple circuit models to huygens metasurfaces @xcite .",
    "moreover , as the effective surface impedance and admittance matrices are directly related to the _ locally averaged _ polarizabilities of the elementary scatterers , we may assess the local equivalent surface impedance of a unit cell by simulating or measuring the effective impedance of an infinite periodic array of such identical unit cells ( local periodicity approximation ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , this modelling approach was used in recent demonstrations of hmss : given the incident field and the desirable transmitted ( or reflected ) field , the required boundary conditions to support the field discontinuities can be formulated , resulting in the required surface impedance and admittance matrices ( or electric and magnetic polarizability distributions ) .    however , for realizing the huygens metasurfaces , it is desirable for the elements implementing the required polarizability distributions to be passive and lossless , i.e. the surface impedance and admittance to possess pure imaginary values . implementing impedance or admittance sheets with nonvanishing real parts requires engineering of gain or loss elements , thereby complicating greatly the design and realization . nonetheless , following the simplistic methodology in which the discontinuities between the desirable and incident fields are directly translated into surface impedances and admittances by no means guarantees the passivity of the resultant metasurface ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , in @xcite the design procedure did not consider the passivity limitation , however the resultant leading to a well - functioning , prototype .",
    "the reasons for that encouraging outcome were not analyzed therein , though .",
    "in addition , almost all huygens metasurfaces presented in the literature to date were designed to be excited by a plane - wave or a beam propagating towards the surface in homogeneous medium @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , to facilitate the development of realizable antenna devices based on huygens metasurfaces it would be necessary to extend the current design techniques to enable excitation of the metasurface by localized ( impulsive ) sources , or waveguided modes .",
    "a step in that direction was made by holloway _",
    "@xcite , where a line source excitation was considered , but only for metasurfaces with _ constant _ polarizability density ; as demonstrated by @xcite , allowing the polarizability densities to vary along the metasurface could be beneficial , providing more degrees of freedom for the design . in this work",
    ", we derive simple rules for designing passive lossless huygens metasurfaces producing directive radiation to a prescribed angle when excited by a given ( arbitrary ) source field . decomposing the fields to their plane - wave spectrum and generalizing the approach presented in @xcite for plane - wave excitation",
    ", we show that satisfying two physical conditions is sufficient to guarantee that the desirable functionality can be achieved by purely reactive surfaces : local power conservation across the surface , and local impedance the fields on both sides of the metasurface . enforcing these conditions locally ,",
    "i.e. at each point on the surface , leads to a complementary set of simple expressions for the surface impedance and surface admittance , as well as facilitates the semi - analytical evaluation of the reflected and transmitted fields .",
    "these results enable design of directive hms radiators with a wide range of source excitations , thus extending significantly the possible applications .",
    "moreover , the derivation provides clear physical interpretation of the conditions required to implement passive lossless hmss , which may also be indicative to equivalent requirements in more generalized scenarios ( e.g. hmss which perform other functionalities ) .",
    "altogether , this forms an efficient and powerful tool for hms engineering , promoting design of novel antenna devices .",

    "the reflection coefficient resulting from the enforcement of local impedance , of which we have little control , should not deteriorate significantly the hms performance .",
    "the second comment refers to the aperture efficiencies presented in table [ tab : line_source_hms_performance ] , which do not exceed @xmath127 for all transmission angles considered , even in the ideal theoretical scenario .",
    "the reason for these values is the utilization of local power conservation in the hms design , that coerces the virtual aperture window function to follow the profile of the total ( incident+reflected ) fields at @xmath128 .",

    ", we note that both the results presented in table [ tab : line_source_hms_performance ] and in fig .",

    "<S> we present a formulation of the interaction between a given source field and a scalar huygens metasurface ( hms ) , a recently introduced promising concept for wavefront manipulation based on a sheet of orthogonal electric and magnetic dipoles . utilizing the equivalent surface impedance representation of these metasurfaces , we establish that an arbitrary source field can be converted into directive radiation via a passive lossless hms if two physical conditions are met : local power conservation and local impedance . expressing the fields via their plane - wave spectrum and harnessing the slowly - varying approximation </S>",
    "<S> we obtain semi - analytical formulae for the scattered fields , and prescribe the surface reactance required for the metasurface implementation . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant design procedure indicates that the local impedance induces a fresnel - like reflection , while local power conservation forms a radiating virtual aperture which follows the total excitation field magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the semi - analytical predictions are verified by finite - element simulations of hmss designed for different source configurations . besides serving as a flexible design procedure for hms radiators </S>",
    "<S> , the proposed formulation also provides a mechanism to incorporate a variety of source configurations into general hms models , as well as physical insight on the conditions enabling purely reactive implementation of this novel type of metasurfaces .    </S>",
