    "with no doubt general relativity ( gr ) is an extremely successful theory about to become centenary @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is expected to break down at some point at very high energies where quantum effects can become important , for example in the past evolution of the universe where gr predicts a big bang singularity @xcite .",
    "this is one of the motivations for looking for possible extension of gr .",
    "moreover , it is hoped that modified theories of gr , while preserving the great achievements of gr , would shed some light over the unknown fundamental nature of dark energy or whatsoever stuff that drives the present accelerating expansion of the universe ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , said in other words : what is the `` hand that started recently to rock the cradle '' ?",
    "indeed , several observations , ranging from type ia supernovae ( sneia ) @xcite ( which brought the first evidence ) to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite , gamma ray bursts ( grb ) @xcite and measures of the hubble parameter at different redshifts @xcite among others , showed that the universe has entered in the recent past a state of acceleration if homogeneity and isotropy is assumed on its largest scale .",
    "actually , observations show that such an accelerating state is fuelled by an _ effective matter _ whose equation of state is pretty much similar to that of a cosmological constant but which could as well deviate from it by leaving room for quintessence and phantom behaviours , the latter being known to induce future singularities ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to formulate consistent modified theories of gravity that could appease the cosmological singularities and could shed some light over the late - time acceleration of the universe .",
    "of course , an alternative way to deal with dark energy singularities is to invoke a quantum approach as done on ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a very interesting theory at this regard has been reformulated recently : the eddington - inspired - born - infeld theory ( eibi ) @xcite , as its name indicates , is based on the gravitational theory proposed by eddington @xcite with an action similar to that of the non - linear electrodynamics of born and infeld @xcite .",
    "such an eibi theory is formulated on the palatini approach , i.e. , the connection that appears in the action is _ not _ the levi - civita connection of the metric in the theory . for a metric approach to the eibi theory",
    "see ref .",
    "like eddington theory @xcite , eibi theory is equivalent to gr in vacuum , however , it differs from it in the presence of matter .",
    "indeed while gr can not avoid the big bang singularity for a universe filled with matter with a constant and a positive equation of state ( with flat and hyperbolic spatial section ) , the eibi setup does as shown in @xcite .",
    "the eibi scenario was as well proposed as an alternative to the inflationary paradigm @xcite through a bounce induced by an evolving equation of state fed by a massive scalar field .",
    "this model comes with the bonus of overcoming the tensor instability previously found in the eibi model in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite for an analysis of the scalar and vectorial perturbations for a radiation dominated universe and the studies on the large scale structure formation in ref .",
    "black hole solutions with charged particles and the strong gravitational lensing within the eibi theory are studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . besides",
    ", the fulfilment of the energy conditions in the eibi theory was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and a sufficient condition for singularity avoidance under the fulfilment of the null energy condition was obtained .",
    "additionally , it was shown that the gravitational collapse of non - interacting particles does not lead to singular states in the newtonian limit @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the parameter characterizing the theory has been constrained using solar models @xcite , neutron stars @xcite , and nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "very recently , neutron stars and wormhole solutions on the eibi theory were analysed in @xcite . especially in @xcite , the authors showed that the universal relations of the f - mode oscillation @xcite , which is the fundamental mode of the pulsation modes in the neutron stars , and the i - love - q relations @xcite , which refers to the relation among the moment of inertia , tidal love numbers ( which are parameters measuring the rigidity of a planetary body and the susceptibility of its shape to change in response to a tidal potential ) and the quadrupole moment of the neutron stars , found in gr are also valid in the eibi theory . a theory which combines the eibi action and the f(r ) action",
    "is also analysed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "a drawback of this theory is that it shares some pathologies with palatini f(r ) gravity such as curvature singularities at the surface of polytropic stars @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we showed recently that despite the big bang avoidance in the eibi setup , the big rip @xcite is unavoidable in the eibi phantom model @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will assume an eibi model and we will carry a thorough analysis of the possible avoidance of the other dark energy related singularities , known as : ( i ) sudden , type ii , big brake or",
    "_ big dmarrage _",
    "singularity @xcite , ( ii ) type iii or big breeze singularity @xcite , and ( iii ) type iv singularity @xcite .",
    "those singularities can show up in gr when a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe is filled with a generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) @xcite ( more precisely , a phantom generalised chaplygin gas , or pgcg for short ) which has a rather chameleonic behaviour despite its simple equation of state @xcite .",
    "indeed , the gcg can unify the role of dark matter and dark energy @xcite ( for a recent update on the subject see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , avoid the big rip singularity @xcite , describe some primitive epoch of the universe @xcite and alleviate the observed low quadruple of the cmb @xcite . we will complete our analyses by considering as well the possible avoidance of the little rip event @xcite on the above mentioned setup .    in the eibi theory",
    ", there are two metrics , the first one @xmath0 appears in the action and couples to matter , the second one is the auxiliary one which is compatible with the connection @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the two metrics reduce to the original one in gr when the curvature term is small .",
    "therefore , we will analyse the singularity avoidance with respect to both metrics . furthermore",
    ", we will use the geodesic equations compatible with both metrics to study the behaviour of the physical radius of a newtonian bounded system near the singularities . for an exhaustive analysis of the geodesics close to the dark energy related singularities in gr",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite . as a result",
    ", we find that the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath0 , more precisely the hubble parameter and its cosmic time derivatives as defined from the metric @xmath0 , near the singularities is consistent with that of the geodesic behaviour dictated by the same metric @xmath0 .",
    "however , the events corresponding to the singularities with respect to @xmath0 are usually well behaved as observed by the connection , and therefore the auxiliary metric , and so do the geodesic equations defined from the physical connection .",
    "in addition , we show that bound structures close to a big rip or little rip will be destroyed before the advent of the singularity and will remain bound close to a sudden , big freeze or type iv singularity .",
    "this result is independent of the choice of the physical or auxiliary metric .",
    "we will further complete our analyses by getting some observational constraints on the model through the use of a cosmographic approach @xcite .",
    "this analysis will show that the eibi model when filled with the matter content mentioned on the previous paragraph on top of the dark and baryonic matter is compatible with the current acceleration of the universe .",
    "the cosmographic approach relies on putting constraints on some parameters which quantify the time derivatives of the scale factor and which are called the cosmographic parameters @xcite .",
    "these parameters depend exclusively on the space - time geometry , in this case on the geometry of a homogeneous and isotropic space - time , and not on the gravitational action or the equations of motion that describe the model ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a nice review on the subject ) .",
    "hence , this approach is quite useful because given a set of constraints on the cosmographic parameters @xcite , it can be applied to a large amount of models in particular to those with relatively messy friedmann equations like the one we need to deal with @xcite .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that with the current observational data the errors can be quite large @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we think it is a fear enough approach for the analysis we want to carry out .",
    "essentially , we will show that among the various birth events or past singularities predicted by the theory , the cosmographic analyses pick up the physical region which determines the occurrence of a type iv singularity ( or a loitering effect ) in the past , which is the most unharmful of all the types of dark energy singularities . while among the various possible future singularities or doomsdays predicted , the use of observational constraints on higher order cosmographic parameters is necessary to predict which future singularity is more probable .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows . in section",
    "ii , we shortly review the idea of the eibi theory and present a thorough analysis on the avoidance of various singularities in this theory , through deriving the asymptotic behaviours of the hubble parameter and its cosmic time derivatives near the singularities for both metrics ( physical and auxiliary ) . in section iii ,",
    "we analyse the effects of the cosmological expansion on local bound systems in the eibi scenario by analysing the geodesics of test particles for both metrics close to a massive body . in section iv",
    ", we use a cosmographic approach to constrain the model , and calculate the cosmic time elapsed since now to the possible , past or future , singularities .",
    "the conclusions and discussions are presented in section v.",
    "we start reviewing the eibi model whose gravitational action in terms of the metric @xmath0 and the connection @xmath2 reads @xcite @xmath3 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\,&+\\,\\mathcal{s}_\\textrm{m } ( g,\\psi ) .",

    "the parameter @xmath5 is a constant with inverse dimensions to that of a cosmological constant ( in this paper , we will work with planck units @xmath6 and set the speed of light to @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath9 stands for the matter lagrangian in which matter is assumed to be coupled covariantly to the metric @xmath10 only .",

    "in addition , we will restrict our analysis to a positive @xmath5 , in order to avoid the imaginary effective sound speed instabilities usually present in the eibi theory with negative @xmath5 @xcite .    for a flrw universe filled with a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath14 and pressure @xmath15",

    "recall that the eibi theory recovers gr when @xmath11 is very small as shown in @xcite . on the other hand , the conservation equation , as mentioned previously , takes the standard form @xmath28    it can be easily verified that the big bang singularity can be avoided in this theory for a radiation dominated universe @xcite ; i.e. @xmath29 , and in general a universe filled with a perfect fluid with a constant and positive equation of state @xmath30 ; i.e. , fulfilling the null energy conditions @xcite , bounces in the past for @xmath31 or has a loitering behaviour in the infinite past for @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "aside , we can define an auxiliary metric @xmath33 which is compatible with the connection @xmath1 @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the scale factor of the physical metric @xmath0 . from the auxiliary metric @xmath33 we can define as well an auxiliary hubble parameter @xmath37 whose rescaled dimensionless value can be expressed as @xmath38 and reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 . besides",

    "one can see that this auxiliary hubble parameter also recovers the hubble parameter in standard gr as the curvature gets small : @xmath48 where @xmath30 is also a constant equation of state parameter .",
    "this auxiliary metric which is compatible with the physical connection can not avoid the big bang singularity in the past because both @xmath37 and @xmath49 diverge at a vanishing @xmath50 and at a finite past @xmath51 , and so does the ricci scalar defined in eq .",
    "( [ aux ] ) .",
    "we will next analyse the possible avoidance of dark energy singularities in the eibi setup .",
    "those singularities , as we will next review , are characterised by possible divergence of the hubble parameter and its cosmic time derivatives at some finite cosmic time .",
    "this translates into possible divergences of the scalar curvature and its cosmic time derivatives .",
    "the eibi model we are considering is formulated within the palatini formalism and therefore there are two ways of defining the ricci curvature : ( i ) @xmath4 as presented in the action ( [ action ] ) and ( ii ) @xmath52 constructed from the metric @xmath0 .",
    "there are in addition four ways of defining the scalar curvature : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "therefore whenever one refers to singularity avoidance , one must specify the specific curvature one is referring to . for the dark energy singularities",
    "the important issue is the behaviour of the hubble parameter and its cosmic time derivatives and in this case we have two possible quantities for the hubble parameter : @xmath18 related to the physical metric and @xmath37 related to the physical connection as defined in eq .",

    ", the loitering effect of the physical metric corresponds to a big bang singularity of the auxiliary metric compatible with the physical connection because both @xmath37 and @xmath49 diverge at a vanishing @xmath50 at a finite past @xmath51 , and so does the ricci scalar defined in eq .",
    "( [ aux ] ) .",
    "we conclude the analysis of this section by considering as well the possibility of smoothing a little rip event within the eibi formalism .",
    "the little rip event is quite similar to the big rip singularity except that the former happens at an infinite future while the latter at a finite cosmic time .",
    "such an event , despite avoiding a future singularity at a finite cosmic time , will still lead to the destruction of all structures in the universe like the big rip . the little rip has been previously analysed under four - dimensional ( 4d ) standard cosmology @xcite , later on rediscovered on @xcite .",
    "it can be found in dilatonic brane - world models @xcite or other kind of brane - world models @xcite .",
    "forty years later after its discovery , the event has been _ baptised _ and named the `` little rip '' @xcite .",
    "the simplest and the most common - used dark energy equation of state driving the little rip in gr is @xcite @xmath210 where @xmath211 is a positive dimensionless constant . after integrating the conservation equation ( [ conservation equation ] ) of the dark energy fluid ( [ eqstatelr ] ) , one can easily check that its energy density @xmath212 as the scale factor @xmath213 .",
    "the asymptotic future behaviour of @xmath47 and the cosmic time derivative of the hubble rate as @xmath213 are @xmath214 besides , for a finite @xmath215 ( at a given cosmic time @xmath216 ) very close to the little rip event ( note that @xmath215 is large enough so that the asymptotic equations are valid ) , the scale factor dependence on the cosmic time @xmath111 , can be approximated by @xmath217\\right\\ } , \\label{littletime}\\ ] ] where @xmath218 is the dimensionless dark energy density when @xmath219 .",
    "as could be expected the radiation and dark matter components have no effect on the asymptotic behaviour and therefore where the little rip could take place . therefore , like in gr the scale factor , hubble parameter and its cosmic time derivatives blow up in an infinite cosmic time where the universe would hit a little rip .",
    "similarly it can be shown that for a matter content given by eq .",
    ", the asymptotic behaviours of @xmath45 and @xmath220 read @xmath221 and other higher order @xmath196 derivatives of @xmath42 approach zero when @xmath89 .",
    "note again that @xmath93 when @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , there is no little rip in the eibi theory if one regards the auxiliary metric as the flrw metric .",
    "actually , the universe approaches a de sitter state as described by the scale factor .    in summary , the asymptotic behaviours of the universe filled with various kinds of dark energy , i.e. , a phantom energy with a constant equation of state , a phantom energy driving a little rip event , and pgcg with different values of @xmath64 on the basis of the eibi theory are shown in table .",
    "[ summary ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the eddington - inspired - born - infeld theory ( eibi ) proposed recently is characterised by being equivalent to einstein theory in vacuum but differing from it in the presence of matter .",
    "most importantly , it also features the ability to avoid some singularities such as the big bang singularity in the finite past of the universe , and the singularity formed after the collapse of a star .",
    "it is hence interesting to see whether this ability to avoid / smooth other kinds of singularities , especially , those driven by the phantom dark energy which could be responsible for the current accelerating expansion of the universe , is efficient enough or not .    in this paper , we give a thorough analysis on the avoidance of all dark energy related singularities by deriving the asymptotic behaviours of the hubble rate and the cosmic time derivatives of the hubble rate defined by the physical metric @xmath0 coupled to matter , and by the auxiliary metric @xmath33 compatible with the physical connection . for the physical metric @xmath0",
    "we find that though the big rip singularity and the little rip event driven by phantom dark energy are not cured in the eibi theory , this theory to some extent smooth the other phantom dark energy related singularities present in gr by leaving some region of the parameter space in which the future big freeze singularity is altered into a future sudden or future type iv singularity .",
    "additionally , the past singularity present in gr is also smoothed in this theory in some parameter space as a past type iv singularity .",
    "note that a past type iv singularity present in gr is , in some parameter space , worsened into a past sudden singularity while smoothed as a regular birth of the universe at some quantized parameter space or even as a loitering effect in an infinite past .",
    "as for the auxiliary metric @xmath33 compatible with the physical connection ( we remind that the eibi setup we are dealing with is formulated _  la _ palatini formalism ) , all the dark energy related singularities of interest are avoided except for some very specific parameter space in which the past type iv singularities of the auxiliary metric still exist ( see table .  [ summary ] for a summary ) .",
    "furthermore , we analysed the fate of a bound structure near the singularities of the eibi theory .",
    "we find that the bound structure would be destroyed before the universe approaches a big rip singularity and a little rip event , while remains bounded at a sudden , big freeze and type iv singularities .",
    "besides , we also use the cosmographic approach , which is characterised by its theoretical model - independence , to constrain the parameters present in our model , so that we in principle can forecast the doomsdays and describe the birth of the universe based on our model . as a result",
    ", it turns out that the cosmographic analyses pick up the physical region which determines the occurrence of a type iv singularity in the finite past or the loitering effect in an infinite past . while it is necessary to impose more conditions , such as the use of higher order cosmographic parameters with more accurate observations or other physical constraints , to forecast the future doomsdays of the universe in this model .",
    "according to these results , the eibi theory is indeed a reliable theory which is able to cure or smooth the singularities predicted originally in gr , thus it makes the theory a convincing alternative to gr as a way to smooth singularities .",

    "<S> the eddington - inspired - born - infeld scenario ( eibi ) can prevent the big bang singularity for a matter content whose equation of state is constant and positive . in a recent paper @xcite we showed that , on the contrary , it is impossible to smooth a big rip in the eibi setup . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the situations are still different for other singularities . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that a big freeze singularity in gr can in some cases be smoothed to a sudden or a type - iv singularity under the eibi scenario . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , a sudden or a type - iv singularity in gr can be replaced in some regions of the parameter space by a type - iv singularity or a loitering behaviour , respectively , in the eibi framework . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that the auxiliary metric related to the physical connection usually has a smoother behaviour than that based on the physical metric . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that bound structures close to a big rip or a little rip will be destroyed before the advent of the singularity and will remain bound close to a sudden , big freeze or type - iv singularity . </S>",
    "<S> we then constrain the model following a cosmographic approach , which is well - known to be model - independent , for a given friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker geometry . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that among the various past or present singularities , the cosmographic analysis can pick up the physical region that determines the occurrence of a type - iv singularity or a loitering effect in the past . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , to determine which of the future singularities or doomsdays is more probable , observational constraints on higher order cosmographic parameters is required . </S>"
