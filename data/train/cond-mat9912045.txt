    "the development of atom - laser output coupling schemes and techniques for coupling single state bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) into two - component condensates have been the subject of many recent experimental studies .",
    "the motivation behind these studies is the development of practical output couplers and the investigation of interactions within condensate mixtures . for these experiments ,",
    "robust and controllable production of different output states is essential .",
    "two - component condensates have been produced using sympathetic cooling @xcite , two photon ( rf and microwave ) transitions @xcite , and rf coupling in optical dipole traps @xcite .",
    "the later allows simultaneous trapping of all the states within a hyperfine manifold .",
    "several output coupling schemes have been demonstrated experimentally : simple rf output coupling @xcite , optically induced bragg diffraction @xcite and josephson tunneling @xcite .",
    "of the six research groups who performed these studies , four used time - averaged orbiting potential ( top ) traps @xcite but none considered effects introduced by the time - varying field .",
    "this paper extends the study of rf output coupling to include dynamics associated with the time - varying field of a top trap .",
    "rf coupling in a static trap was recently characterised by @xcite , and a high degree of control demonstrated . in a top trap ,",
    "the population dynamics are strongly influenced by the time - varying nature of the trap .",
    "we find that the presence of the rotating magnetic field can significantly alter the apparent spectral width of the applied rf field , which in turn changes the spatial profile of the coupling region .",
    "we also find that the large quadrupole gradient of the top trap gives rise to a large change in the effective rabi frequency across the cloud , leading to complex spatial population distributions .",
    "our experimental procedure has been described in @xcite .",
    "we start with a @xmath1rb bose - einstein condensate in the @xmath4 state , confined in a top trap with radial quadrupole field gradient @xmath5  g  @xmath6 and bias field @xmath7  g. we then apply an rf coupling field with polarization perpendicular to the plane of rotation of the top field .",
    "the effect of this field is to induce transitions between adjacent @xmath8 states in the @xmath9 hyperfine manifold , and hence the initially pure @xmath10 condensate state becomes a mixture of the five possible @xmath8 states . by changing the frequency , duration and magnitude of the coupling field different admixtures of the manifold states can be generated .",
    "note that states @xmath11 and @xmath12 are high field seeking and therefore actively repelled from the trap , and state @xmath13 being essentially magnetically insensitive is untrapped ; hence these states will be present in the trapping region for only a few milliseconds after the coupling pulse . once the coupling field has been applied we separate the trapped components by removing the trapping potential and 1  ms later applying a magnetic field gradient which introduces a stern - gerlach separation .",
    "the different magnetic sub - states ( @xmath10 and @xmath14 ) become easily resolvable after about 5  ms .",
    "although the probing pulse is tuned on resonance with the @xmath10 state , the population of the @xmath14 state is also accurately determined since the 50  @xmath15s probing pulse ( in a 4  g bias field ) leads to rapid optical pumping into the @xmath10 state .",
    "this gives us effective resonant probing of both condensate @xmath8 states .",
    "typical results of this process are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : twocomponent ] .    s.",
    "the individual images are 250  @xmath15 m along each axis and are taken after a 5  ms time - of - flight through the inhomogeneous magnetic field . ]",
    "to analyze this coupling process , it is helpful conceptually to first consider the case of a static magnetic trap , such as a ioffe - pritchard ( i - p ) configuration .",
    "when an rf field is applied to couple atoms into other states , the static magnetic field gradient gives rise to a static but spatially varying detuning @xmath16 . to calculate the linewidth of a pulse of duration @xmath17 we must consider the relative effects of the pulse spectral width and power broadening (",
    "note that the natural linewidth of an rf transition is insignificant in comparison ) .",
    "the pulse spectral width is given by @xmath18 and the power broadening ( for @xmath19 ) by @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the magnetic field amplitude of the rf coupling field .",
    "for the @xmath22 transition the linewidth is a factor of @xmath23 smaller .",
    "these two mechanisms combine to give an intrinsic linewidth associated with the rf pulse .",
    "the detail of how these combine depends on the exact form of each lineshape .",
    "the lineshape associated with power broadening is lorentzian .",
    "however , the spectral lineshape is determined by the shape of the rf pulse , which for a square pulse gives rise to a sinc spectral distribution .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that addition in quadrature is a good approximation , so that @xmath24    we now include the effects of a time varying magnetic field . in a typical top trap",
    "significant angular change in the orientation of the bias field will occur during even a short rf pulse ( e.g. with a bias field rotating at @xmath25 = 7  khz , a 10  @xmath15s pulse corresponds to a 25@xmath26 change in direction ) .",
    "the effect of this rotation is to introduce time dependence to the already spatially varying detuning .",
    "this time dependence affects the coupling process in two distinct ways .",
    "firstly , as the quadrupole field rotates about the centre of the cloud the detuning at any fixed point varies sinusoidally with time .",
    "secondly , this sinusoidal variation in the detuning introduces a spatially dependent transit time broadening of the transition linewidth .",
    "effectively , the available interaction time is reduced from @xmath27 to @xmath28 by the time varying detuning .",
    "this transit time broadening , @xmath29 , depends on the distance @xmath30 from the axis of rotation of the top field ( in our case the z - axis ) and @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the radial gradient of the rf transition frequency ( arising from the zeeman shift associated with the quadrupole field gradient @xmath34 ) given by @xmath35    by careful choice of experimental parameters , one might choose to avoid the complications introduced by the rotating field .",
    "this could be achieved , for example , by broadening the rf transition so that the coupling rate is essentially the same for all atoms . in our experiment",
    ", the transition frequency gradient is 14  khz  @xmath15m@xmath36 and our condensate diameter is @xmath37 30  @xmath15 m , giving a change in the transition frequency across the spatial extent of the cloud of 420  khz .",
    "therefore , in order for the coupling to be insensitive to the field rotation , the coupling field would need to have a linewidth significantly larger than 420  khz .",
    "this could be achieved in two ways , with a very short pulse ( duration @xmath38s ) or a very intense rf field ( amplitude @xmath39 g ) .",
    "( [ equation : gammatransit ] ) we can now determine the total rf transition linewidth @xmath40 the spatial dependence of the linewidth is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : linewidth ] for three different values of @xmath41 .     as a function of position within the condensate for weak rf field and three different pulse lengths :   32  @xmath15s , @xmath42  16  @xmath15s , and @xmath43  8  @xmath44s.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    there are two regimes that simplify the expression for @xmath45 .",
    "the first of these is where @xmath46 , in which case transit broadening can be ignored , and the linewidth of the coupling process can be treated as a constant ( e.g. figure [ figure : linewidth ] , @xmath47  @xmath15 s ) .",
    "the second case is when @xmath48 ( e.g. in the case of quasi - continuous output coupling ) . from eq .",
    "( [ equation : gammatransit ] ) we see that the linewidth in this case is approximately linear with radius .",
    "however , in our experiments neither of these simple approximations apply and a more complete treatment is required .",
    "we are able to broadly predict the population dynamics of the various @xmath8 states as a function of time with the following simple rabi cycling model that neglects any kinetic or mean - field effects within the condensate . in an @xmath9 manifold there are four rabi frequencies @xmath49 associated with the rf field , where @xmath50 couples states @xmath51 , @xmath52 states @xmath53 , etc . from the clebsch - gordan coefficients for the transitions ,",

    "is introduced to account for the rotation of the top field , and @xmath60 accounts for the effects of @xmath61 introduced in eq .",

    "figure [ figure : rabicycles ] shows the calculated populations of states @xmath10 and @xmath67 as a function of time for three distinct regimes : ( a ) strong coupling such that the coupling rate is uniform across the condensate , ( b ) very slow bias field rotation and weak ( and therefore inhomogeneous ) coupling across the condensate , and ( c ) typical experimental conditions of weak coupling with rapid bias field rotation , which introduces temporal variation into the coupling . unless stated otherwise , to match our experimental conditions we set @xmath69 with @xmath70  khz  @xmath15m@xmath36 , and allow a 1  @xmath15s rise and fall time on @xmath71 which has an amplitude of 72  mg ( equivalent to @xmath72  khz ) . to calculate the total population in each state we assume a 3-d thomas - fermi distribution of size 30  @xmath15 m  @xmath73  30  @xmath15 m  @xmath73  11  @xmath15 m and integrate over this region .    when the linewidth is significantly larger than the change in transition frequency across the condensate ( as in fig .",

    "[ figure : rabicycles](b ) , although we have eliminated bias field rotation , complex spatial behaviour results since the coupling linewidth is smaller than the zeeman shift across the condensate .",
    "however the decay of rabi cycling due to large detuning changes across the cloud leads to an equilibrium population distribution that depends only on the pulse linewidth of the transition relative to the zeeman shift across the condensate .",

    "the decrease of the @xmath10 state population with increased rf field behaves as we might expect , whilst the @xmath14 state population appears to grow more rapidly than predicted .",

    "there are large phase gradients associated with the predicted spatial structure and these correspond to increased internal energy .",
