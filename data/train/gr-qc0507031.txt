    "a maximally extended and regular covering of the schwarzschild vacuum is now a fundamental part of any introduction to general relativity . almost always the covering is given by way of the implicit kruskal @xcite - szekeres @xcite procedure @xcite .",
    "however , as emphasized long ago by ehlers @xcite , an explicit maximally extended and regular covering of the schwarzschild vacuum is known and was first given by israel @xcite . unfortunately , despite the fact that these coordinates offer many advantages over the kruskal - szekeres coordinates , they are almost never used . in this paper",
    "i extend israel s procedure to the schwarzschild - de sitter class of vacua in four dimensions and then to arbitrary dimensions @xmath0 assuming a @xmath1 sphere as in the tangherlini generalization of the schwarzschild vacuum .",
    "moreover , it is made clear that these coordinates offer important advantages over the kruskal - szekeres procedure .",
    "these advantages include : an explicit representation of the line element that can be extended to arbitrary dimension , a simultaneous covering of both the black hole and cosmological horizons and derivation by direct integration of einstein s equations @xcite without recourse to coordinate transformations .",
    "we start with a spherically symmetric spacetime in coordinates @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a null four - vector so that the line element takes the form @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the metric of a unit two - sphere ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "further , setting @xmath7 ( so that trajectories of constant @xmath8 and @xmath9 are radial null geodesics affinely parameterized by @xmath10 ) it follows that @xmath11 . defining @xmath12 and rewriting @xmath13 as @xmath14 we set @xmath15 in ( [ generalmetric ] ) which remains a completely general spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "the expansion of @xmath16 reduces to @xmath17 associated with the vector field @xmath18 we have @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 the trajectories of constant @xmath22 and @xmath9 are radial null geodesics ( affinely parameterized by @xmath14 ) only for @xmath23 .",
    "note that if @xmath24 then @xmath25 is tangent to a radial null geodesic and clearly @xmath10 is again affine .",
    "the associated geodesics immediately follow as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a constant .",
    "important examples of this special case are given below .",
    "for the spacetime ( [ generalmetric ] ) with @xmath15 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) are constants , it follows that @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 @xmath39 is the ricci tensor , @xmath40 the ricciscalar and @xmath41 the weyl tensor . viewing @xmath28 as a constant of nature and @xmath33 a property of the vacuum , it is clear from ( [ lambda ] ) that the specification of @xmath31 does not determine the physical situation uniquely . since , by ( [ r(u , w ) ] ) , the axes are centered on @xmath42 , it is important to distinguish ranges in @xmath31 . writing @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 it follows immediately from ( [ lambda ] ) that @xmath46 it follows from ( [ crange ] ) that all values of @xmath47 are determined uniquely by @xmath48 using the following ranges : @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "the latter range is of no interest and is not discussed here .",
    "the one independent invariant derivable from the riemmann tensor without differentiation can be taken to be ( [ weylscalar ] ) and so with @xmath14 and @xmath10 extending over the reals , the vacua are maximally extended and regular for @xmath53 ( and for all finite @xmath54 if @xmath55 ) . in particular , note that @xmath56    with ( [ r(u , w ) ] ) it follows that @xmath57 from ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ r(u , w ) ] ) it follows that trajectories of constant @xmath22 and @xmath9 are radial null geodesics only for @xmath58 .",
    "more generally , the radial null geodesics that satisfy @xmath59 with @xmath60 given by ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ r(u , w ) ] ) , can be written down in terms of elementary functions ( as explained below ) .",
    "note that for these trajectories @xmath61 as @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 as @xmath65 .",
    "we distinguish the cases : @xmath55 ( de sitter ) , @xmath66 ( bertotti - kasner ) , @xmath67 ( schwarzschild ) , @xmath68 ( schwarzschild - de sitter ) , @xmath69 ( schwarzschild - anti de sitter ) and discuss them below . for the case @xmath67 the coordinates were first obtained by israel @xcite . not covered as special cases are anti de sitter space ( see appendix a ) and the degenerate schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime ( see appendix b ) .      with @xmath55 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and we have de sitter space .",
    "the metric simplifies to @xmath72 trajectories with four tangents @xmath73 are radial null geodesics ( so @xmath10 is affine for both radial null directions ) .",
    "we can write these geodesics in the form @xmath74 where @xmath27 is a constant . the negative cosmological horizons ( @xmath75 ) are then given by @xmath76 where the expansion @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) vanishes .",
    "some details are shown in fig .",
    "[ desitterfig ] .      with @xmath79",
    "we have bertotti - kasner space .",
    "the metric simplifies to @xmath80 trajectories with four tangents @xmath81 are radial null geodesics ( so again @xmath10 is affine for both radial null directions ) but now @xmath82 .",
    "we can write these geodesics in the form @xmath83 where @xmath27 is a constant .",
    "the @xmath84 plane is like that of de sitter space now with @xmath85 ( again @xmath76 ) distinguishing the branches of the @xmath86 geodesics .",
    "this space shows that the birkhoff theorem does not extend directly to @xmath87 ( see the case @xmath88 below ) @xcite .      with @xmath67 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and",
    "we have the schwarzschild vacuum in israel coordinates @xcite .",
    "the metric simplifies to @xmath91 trajectories with four tangents @xmath92 are radial null geodesics so @xmath10 is not affine .",
    "now @xmath93 .",
    "we write these geodesics in the form @xmath94 where @xmath27 is a constant .",
    "some details are shown in fig .",
    "[ schwarzschild ] .",
    "again writing @xmath43 it follows that for @xmath95 there is another constant @xmath96 for which @xmath97 .",
    "the constant is given by @xmath98 with @xmath99 the trajectories @xmath100 are radial null geodesics ( with non - zero expansion ) tangent to the  cosmological \" horizons .",
    "note that @xmath101 as @xmath102 and @xmath103 as @xmath104 .",
    "now define @xmath105 and @xmath106 trajectories with four tangents @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 where @xmath27 is a constant , are radial null geodesics .",
    "now we find that the expansion is given by @xmath110 where @xmath111 the choice @xmath112 reproduces the bertotti - kasner result and the choice @xmath113 reproduces the schwarzschild vacuum result both for @xmath114 as given above . for @xmath95 these geodesics can be given explicitly in terms of elementary functions and are reproduced in appendix c. some details are shown in fig .",
    "[ schwarzdesitter ] .",
    "for @xmath116 there are no cosmological horizons but equations ( [ adef ] ) through ( [ fdef ] ) hold as given above . again",
    "the associated radial null geodesics can be given explicitly in terms of elementary functions and are reproduced in appendix d. some details are shown in fig . [ antidesitterimage ] .",
    "this section parallels ii but extends the construction to arbitrary dimensions ( @xmath118 ) . write @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the metric of a unit @xmath1 sphere .",
    "again @xmath3 is tangent to null geodesics affinely parameterized by @xmath10 but now the associated expansion is given by @xmath121 further , associated with the vector field @xmath18 we again have @xmath19 and @xmath122 but now the associated expansion is @xmath123 the trajectories for which all coordinates are constant except @xmath14 are radial null geodesics ( affinely parameterized by @xmath14 ) only for @xmath23 . finally , as before , if @xmath24 then @xmath124 is tangent to a radial null geodesic with @xmath10 again affine and the associated geodesics immediately follow as @xmath125 where @xmath27 is a constant .",
    "this section generalizes section iii above . for dimensions",
    "@xmath126 consider the spaces described by @xmath127 where the function @xmath128 is given by @xmath129 and @xmath54 signifies the function @xmath130 with @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) constants .",
    "it follows that @xcite @xmath131 @xmath132 and @xmath133 where @xmath134 again , the one independent invariant derivable from the riemmann tensor without differentiation can be taken to be ( [ weylscalargen ] ) and so with @xmath14 and @xmath10 extending over the reals , the spaces described by ( [ metricsgen ] ) are maximally extended and regular for @xmath53 ( and for all @xmath54 if @xmath135 , see below ) .",
    "in particular , note that @xmath136 again viewing @xmath28 as a constant of nature and @xmath33 a property of the vacuum , the specification of @xmath31 does not determine the physical situation uniquely .",
    "this is discussed below . in view of the generality of the cases considered ,",
    "the formulae given are remarkably simple .",
    "consider the hyper - spherically symmetric spacetime @xmath137 note that @xmath54 is now a coordinate .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the unique form of @xmath60 which satisfies ( [ riccigen ] ) is given by @xmath138 where @xmath139 is a constant ( which we take @xmath140 ) .",
    "this solution was apparently first discussed by tangherlini @xcite .",
    "the coordinates are , of course , defective at @xmath141 , but the associated roots depend on @xmath0 and are not so easy to find from ( [ curvaturef ] ) .",
    "the previous construction circumvents this unnecessary algebra as follows : for ( [ curvature ] ) with ( [ curvaturef ] ) we find @xmath142 and so from ( [ weylscalargen ] ) and ( [ weylsqcurv ] ) ( assuming , without loss in generality , the same coordinates for @xmath120)we have the relation @xmath143 which gives @xmath144 only for @xmath145 . now substituting for @xmath139 from ( [ mrelation ] ) into ( [ curvaturef ] ) and writing an associated root to @xmath141 as @xmath42 we obtain ( [ lambdagen ] ) . in this way",
    "we never need to deal with ( [ curvaturef ] ) and so all dimensions @xmath118 are equally difficult to deal with as regards the location of horizons .",
    "the previous section raises the issue of  mass \" . in spacetime with @xmath89 the concept of mass in the spherically symmetric case",
    "is well established @xcite .",
    "the geometrical mass in @xmath146 dimensions for spaces admitting a @xmath147sphere has been defined previously by way of the sectional curvature @xcite . whereas this is merely a formal definition , it is of interest to compare this definition with @xmath33 and @xmath139 . in dimension @xmath0",
    "define @xmath148 in the special case @xmath149 it follows that @xmath150 more generally , for @xmath151 , it follows that @xmath152 where @xmath28 is given by ( [ lambdagen ] ) .",
    "we can , of course , replace @xmath139 by @xmath33 in ( [ geomasslambda ] ) by solving for @xmath33 from ( [ mrelation ] ) .",
    "we now consider some specific cases .",
    "we define hyper - spherical de sitter space by the requirement @xmath135 so that from ( [ weylscalargen ] ) and ( [ weylsqcurv ] ) we have @xmath153 and so @xmath154 the metric follows as @xmath155 trajectories with four tangents @xmath156 are radial null geodesics ( so @xmath10 is affine for both radial null directions ) .",

    "in fact , the qualitative behavior of all solutions to ( [ othernullhigh ] ) can be obtained without explicit integration .",
