    "nonlinear field theories contain a large number of localized solutions that display a rich array of properties @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are those that are static and stable , that is , that retain their spatial profile as they move across space or scatter with each other , as is the case of sine - gordon solitons .",
    "the details of the solitonic configurations are , of course , sensitive to the dimensionality of space and to the nature of the field interactions .",
    "long ago , derrick has shown that , in the case of models with just a real scalar field , no static solitonic configurations can exist in more than one spatial dimension @xcite .",
    "given that most models of interest in high energy physics involve more complicated fields in three spatial dimensions , this restriction was somewhat frustrating .",
    "fortunately , the subsequent exploration of a variety of models led to a plethora of static , nonperturbative , localized field configurations .",
    "examples include topological defects , solutions of models usually involving gauge fields that owe their stability to the nontrivial topology of the vacuum , such as strings and monopoles @xcite , and the so - called nontopological solitons , solutions of models where a conserved global charge is trapped inside a finite region of space due to a mass gap condition , such as @xmath4-balls @xcite and the models with a real and a complex scalar field of friedberg , lee , and sirlin @xcite .    in the mid - nineties @xcite ,",
    "a new class of localized nonperturbative solution began to be explored in detail , after being proposed earlier @xcite . named oscillons , such long - lived solutions have the distinctive and counter - intuitive feature of being time - dependent . in spite of this",
    ", the nonlinear interactions act to preserve the localization of the energy , which remains approximately constant for a surprisingly long time @xcite . during the past few years , oscillons have attracted much interest .",
    "their properties were explored in two @xcite and higher @xcite spatial dimensions , in the presence of gauge fields @xcite , in the standard model of particle physics @xcite , and in a simple cosmological setting @xcite .",
    "there have also been detailed attempts at understanding some properties of oscillon - related configurations ( typically with small - amplitude oscillations ) , including their longevity , using perturbative techniques @xcite . on the other hand , a treatment explaining the remarkable longevity of oscillons in models related to spontaneous symmetry breaking , and thus of obvious interest in particle physics and cosmology , has been lacking .",
    "the situation was partially remedied recently , when we published a preliminary treatment of the problem @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we greatly extend the range of our dynamical theory of oscillons in scalar field models , include the details of many key derivations and demonstrate its accuracy in reproducing numerical results .",
    "our approach is general enough to be extended to different scalar field models that exhibit long - lived , time - dependent localized configurations .",
    "in order to introduce some of the basic quantities needed for our theory , it is instructive to start by reviewing some of the main properties of relativistic oscillons .",
    "we will do so in the context of a simple @xmath0 model with a symmetric double - well potential , as this is also the main focus of the present work .",

    "quantities are scaled to be dimensionless as follows : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we will henceforth only use dimensionless variables , dropping the subscript `` @xmath10 '' .",
    "we start by investigating the linear theory so that we can more easily contrast it with nonlinear models that give rise to oscillons .",
    "since oscillons have been shown to maintain their approximate gaussian - shaped spatial profiles during their lifetimes , we will write the scalar field as @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the time - dependent amplitude of the configuration and @xmath13 its spatial profile , which is parameterized by the radial extension @xmath14 .      as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath1 linear theory with a gaussian - profile initial condition has the solution , @xmath15{\\pi}}\\int_{0}^{\\infty } k e^{-r^2 k^2 /4}\\frac{\\sin ( k r)}{r } \\cos\\left(\\omega t\\right)dk,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is an arbitrary initial amplitude and the dispersion relation is @xmath17 , where the mass frequency @xmath18 . to calculate @xmath19 , the decay width associated with the above solution",

    "this yields the linear decay width @xmath19 , @xmath25    in the linear theory , any initial configuration  or excitation above the vacuum  will quickly decay by emitting radiation .",
    "the key difference between the linear and the oscillon - supporting nonlinear models is that , in the latter case , the decay modes are strongly suppressed .",
    "it is this suppression that gives rise to the oscillon s remarkable longevity .",
    "our goal in this paper is to make this statement quantitatively precise . to obtain the linear radiation distribution , which we denote by @xmath26",
    ", we simply take the @xmath27-space representation @xmath28 of the gaussian in eq .",

    "now define @xmath33 and @xmath34 to be the frequencies where the distribution @xmath26 rises to half of its peak value .",
    "a straightforward calculation gives @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the radiation distribution is then approximately centered on the frequency @xmath37 , given by ( see fig . [",
    "fig : linearpeaks ] ) , @xmath38 which we take to represent the dominant linear radiation frequency .",
    "imagine now that one or more nonlinear terms are added to the linear potential and that the field is again initialized with the same localized gaussian perturbation .",
    "roughly speaking , the nonlinearities will shift the dominant linear oscillation frequency @xmath37 , to a new value , denoted by @xmath39 . if the added terms serve to decrease the curvature of the potential , then @xmath40 .",
    "such a situation is depicted qualitatively in fig .",
    "[ fig : linearpeaks ] , where the arrow indicates how the shift in frequencies occurs .    when nonlinearities are efficient enough that @xmath39 is lowered substantially below @xmath37 , an oscillon may form .",
    "the reason for this is the following . as the initial field configuration begins to oscillate , it will attempt to emit small - amplitude radiation waves in an effort to dissipate its energy . however , if @xmath39 is sufficiently less than @xmath37 , the bulk of the frequency components composing the oscillation will be unable to excite small - amplitude radiation waves ( since the configuration can only radiate appreciably in the frequency range @xmath41 ) .",
    "this condition leads to the stabilization mechanism responsible for the formation of oscillons .     being shifted to the left by the presence of nonlinearities .",
    "an oscillon will form if the peak is shifted far enough into the nonlinear region such that it no longer overlaps significantly with the linear peak.,height=220 ]    it then follows that the oscillon will enter the nonlinear regime if the two peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : linearpeaks ] do not significantly overlap .",
    "mathematically , the right `` edge '' of the nonlinear peak , given by @xmath42 , must be less than the left `` edge '' of the linear peak , given by @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath44 which , by defining @xmath45 as the frequency gap between the linear and nonlinear peaks , becomes @xmath46 since nonlinearities tend to increase a configuration s lifetime and thus decrease its decay rate , it follows that @xmath47",
    ". one can thus state that if @xmath48 then the configuration will be forced into the nonlinear regime .",
    "in other words , eq . [ condition ] is a _ necessary _ condition for the formation of an oscillon .",
    "as we will soon see , if an oscillon is formed and , during the course of its time evolution , reaches a point where eq .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive , nonperturbative analytical method to investigate the dynamics of time - dependent oscillating scalar field configurations . the method is applied to oscillons in a @xmath0 klein - gordon model in two and three spatial dimensions , yielding high accuracy results in the characterization of all aspects of the complex oscillon dynamics . in particular , </S>",
