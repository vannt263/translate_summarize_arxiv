    "these order parameter measurements are shown in fig .",
    "3 ( a ) and ( b ) , for the temperature dependence at zero field , and the field dependence at t = 0.4 k , respectively .",
    "this field and temperature dependence of the order parameter identify the new low temperature bragg peak as magnetic in origin and corresponding to the sharp anomaly observed in the zero field heat capacity , as shown in fig .",
    "interestingly , the phase transition appears to be continuous as a function of temperature at zero field ( fig .",
    "3 ( a ) ) but rather discontinuous as a function of field at low temperatures ( fig .",
    "3 ( b ) ) .    while we have observed only a single magnetic bragg peak for cumoo@xmath0 below @xmath5 , we can model its magnetic structure , based on its periodicity as shown in fig . 2 ( b ) , wherein we pair off 4 of the 6 @xmath1 moments per unit cell into 2 singlets , and allow the remaining 2 spins to order ferromagnetically within a unit cell and antiferromagnetically from cell to cell along the triclinic * a * direction .",
    "the rationale for pairing 4 of the 6 @xmath1 spins per unit cell off into non - magnetic singlets comes both from recent high - field magnetization studies @xcite and from inelastic neutron scattering results which we report below .",

    "the triplet excitations have a band width of @xmath4 2.5 mev , with a gap of @xmath4 2.3 mev .",
    "the band width likely originates from weak dispersion within the triplet of excited states due to inter - dimer exchange coupling , as observed in other singlet ground state systems such as srcu@xmath6(bo@xmath7)@xmath6@xcite .    on applying an h = 4 t magnetic field at low temperatures ( fig .",

    "higher energy resolution measurements were also taken with cncs using an incident neutron energy of e@xmath20 = 1.55  mev , and these are shown for t = 1.5 k in fig .",
    "again a high temperature data set at t = 50 k and h = 0 t has been subtracted from this data set to isolate the magnetic scattering from the sample .",
    "this higher energy resolution data set clearly shows a goldstone spin wave mode emanating out of the magnetic bragg peak position at q = 0.34 @xmath25 . beyond @xmath4 0.6 @xmath25 the spin wave density of states is strongly peaked at @xmath4 0.55 mev , however , a second distribution of magnetic scattering , with a bandwidth of @xmath4 0.25 mev is evident between 0.7 and 1.0 mev .",
    "these two bands of spin wave scattering account for the quasi - elastic magnetic scattering observed with lower energy resolution ( fig .",
    "4 ) wherein quasi - elastic scattering is observed out to @xmath4 1 mev .",
    "given that the magnetically ordered ground state below @xmath5 is described by an antiferromagnetic alternation of ferromagnetically - coupled spins along the trigonal * a * direction , it is not surprising that two bands of spin wave excitations , an acoustic and an optic band , would be present at low temperatures .",

    "clearly the bottom of the triplet scattering near @xmath4 2.5 mev is depleted and transferred down to @xmath4 1.75 mev , within the gap , by application of the magnetic field .",
    "this is consistent with expectations for zeeman splitting of a weakly dispersive triplet band .",
    "simultaneously , the spectral weight of the low energy spin wave excitations are moved to higher energies within the gap .",

    "these largely corroborate the time - of - flight measurements show in figs . 4 and 5 ,",
    "although they are carried out to larger applied magnetic fields , up to h = 7.5  t. these measurements were performed with an energy resolution of @xmath4 1 mev , and thus detail within the quasi - elastic spin wave band of scattering is obscured by nuclear elastic incoherent scattering .",
    "nonetheless , the triplet excitations and singlet - triplet gap can be clearly observed , as well as the filling of the gap with increasing magnetic field .",
    "figure 6 ( a ) shows s(q = 1.1 @xmath25 , e ) for t = 1.5 k and t = 50 k and zero magnetic field , while fig . 6 ( b ) shows the same spectra but for h = 7.5 t. figure 7 ( a ) shows the field dependence of s(q = 1.1 @xmath25 , e ) at t = 1.5 k , while fig .",
    "7 ( b ) focusses on the low energy part of this spectrum , for h = 0 t and h = 7.5 t only , after the high temperature background at t = 50 k has been subtracted from both data sets .",

    "6 ( a ) and ( b ) and fig .",
    "7 ( a ) is logarithmic , while that of fig .",
    "7 ( b ) is linear .",
    "this comparison clearly shows spectral weight from the low energy side of the triplet band being depleted and displaced downwards in energy by g@xmath31h @xmath4 0.7 mev to @xmath4 1.6 mev .",
    "the low energy spin waves are also raised in energy by application of a field , and this also pushes magnetic intensity into the gap .",
    "the higher end of the triplet bandwidth , above 3.5 mev , shows less field dependence , but the scattering is weaker here , and the averaging effects of the triplet dispersion may be greater .",
    "we have carried out heat capacity and both elastic and inelastic neutron scattering measurements on powder samples of the triclinic quantum magnet cumoo@xmath0 with the purpose of understanding the nature of its low temperature ground state .",
    "all results are consistent with an antiferromagnetic long range ordered ground state appearing below @xmath5 = 1.75 k in h = 0 t. the ordering wavevector associated with this antiferromagnetic order is identified as ( 1/2 , 0 , 0 ) , and this is consistent with a low temperature state in which the molecule of six cu@xmath2 ions , which makes up the triclinic structure , organizes into 4 @xmath1 moments which form two singlets , as well as 2 ferromagnetically coupled @xmath1 moments which then order antiferromagnetically along the triclinic * a * direction .",
    "we explicitly show that at low temperatures this ordered state is destroyed by an applied magnetic field of @xmath4 1.5 t.    our inelastic neutron scattering measurements on cumoo@xmath0 probe the magnetic excitation spectrum and show it to be well described by dispersive triplet excitations with a gap of @xmath4 2.3 mev and a bandwidth of @xmath4 2.5 mev .",
    "low lying spin wave excitations are also observed , and are shown to display a goldstone mode for t@xmath21 @xmath5 which is soft at the ordering wavevector of q @xmath4 0.35 @xmath25 , as well as a second branch of spin wave excitations forming a band in the approximate range 0.6 - 1.0 mev .    the picture arising from the measurements we present , of an antiferromagnetic long range ordered structure made up of co - existing non - magnetic singlets and ferromagnetically - coupled spins , is clearly exotic , comprised as it is by both of the ground states normally associated with antiferromagnetism in materials .",
    "cumoo@xmath0 is clearly an interesting and exotic example where both ordered spins and singlets are the building blocks from which the antiferromagnetic ground state is constructed .",
    "we hope this study will guide and inform further theoertical studies of this and related quantum magnets .",

    "<S> cumoo@xmath0 is a triclinic quantum magnet based on @xmath1 moments at the cu@xmath2 site . </S>",
    "<S> it has recently attracted interest due to the remarkable changes in its chromic and volumetric properties at high temperatures , and in its magnetic properties at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this material exhibits a first order structural phase transition at @xmath3 @xmath4 190 k as well as a magnetic phase transition at @xmath5 @xmath4 1.75 k. we report low temperature heat capacity measurements as well as extensive elastic and inelastic neutron scattering measurements on powder samples taken above and below @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe neutron diffraction consistent with a simple ( 1/2 , 0 , 0 ) antiferromagnetic structure indicating a doubling of the a - axis periodicity below @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , inelastic neutron scattering above a spin gap of @xmath4 2.3 mev is consistent with triplet excitations out of paired @xmath1 moments which form singlet dimers . </S>",
    "<S> low lying spin wave excitations are also observed and these originate from ordered @xmath1 moments below @xmath5 . taken together these measurements show the ground state of cumoo@xmath0 to display both non - magnetic singlets , and ferromagnetically - coupled spins coexisting within an antiferromagnetic structure below @xmath5 @xmath4 1.75 k. </S>"
