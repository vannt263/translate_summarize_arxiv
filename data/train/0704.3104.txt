    "the rapid process ( r - process ) is known to be responsible for about half of the abundances of elements heavier than fe in solar - system material .",
    "since the reaction occurs through very neutron - rich , unstable nuclei , the understanding of the process is still a challenging issue in nuclear physics .",
    "the astrophysical sites of this process are still unclear , though numerical simulations have been made for many possibilities ( e.g. wanajo & ishimaru 2006 ) .",
    "an important progress in this field in the past decade is the discoveries of very metal - poor stars having large over - abundances of r - process elements .",
    "such objects are expected to record the yields of nucleosynthetic events in the early galaxy including the r - process .",
    "several objects having very large excesses of r - process elements ( e.g. eu ) with respect to other metals ( [ eu / fe]@xmath3 ) are known in the galactic halo @xcite , and are called as r - ii stars @xcite .",
    "a remarkable result for these stars is that the abundance patterns of neutron - capture elements are very similar .",
    "objects having such large excesses of r - process elements are only found at the metallicity around [ fe / h]@xmath4 , and no object having [ eu / fe]@xmath5 is known in the range of [ fe / h]@xmath6 in the galactic halo , though the reason for such a metallicity distribution is still unknown .    however , the situation is quite different in some dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsph ) , in which high abundance ratios of r - process elements are found even in stars with relatively high metallicity .",
    "the chemical abundance studies for individual stars in the local group dsph made large progresses in the past several years , thanks to high resolution spectrographs mounted at 810  m telescopes ( e.g. shetrone et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ; venn et al .",
    "one surprising result derived by these abundance studies is the existence of stars showing extremely large enhancements of heavy neutron - capture elements with relatively high metallicity .",
    "the most remarkable star is the red giant cos  82 in the ursa minor dsph .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy of this object was first obtained by shetrone et al .",
    "( 2001 ; in their paper , this star is referred to as 199 ) , who reported that this star is moderately metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath7 ) but shows large enhancement of heavy neutron - capture elements ( [ eu / fe]=1.49 ) .",
    "our previous observing obtained a red spectrum of this star with higher quality , and has successfully detected some other heavy elements ( e.g. dy , er ) , confirming that the abundance pattern of elements heavier than ba almost completely agrees with the r - process abundance pattern estimated from solar - system material ( sadakane et al .",
    "this result is surprising , because no moderately metal - poor star ( [ fe / h]@xmath8 ) in our galaxy is known to date to have such large excesses of r - process elements .",
    "tsujimoto & shigeyama ( 2002 ) applied their supernova - driven star formation model and proposed that this phenomenon can be explained by assuming a large velocity dispersion of the gas from which low mass stars like cos  82 formed .    in this letter , we report the detection of the th absorption line at 5989   for this object by the re - analysis of our high resolution spectrum obtained by @xcite .",
    "the actinide th has an isotope whose half life is 14.05 gyr , and is produced only by the r - process .",
    "the production of actinides is very sensitive to the environment of the sites ( e.g. entropy , timescale of the explosion ) according to model calculations for the r - process .",
    "therefore , the th abundance can be a very strong constraint on the study of the origin of the neutron - capture elements in this object . while th abundance has been determined for more than ten field metal - poor stars and globular cluster stars ,",
    "our measurement for cos  82 is the first determination of an actinide abundance for an extra galacitic object .",
    "we also discuss the possibility to apply the th abundance ratio to estimate the age of this object .",
    "a high resolution spectrum of cos  82 was obtained by @xcite with the subaru telescope high dispersion spectrograph ( hds , noguchi et al .",
    "the spectrum covers 44007100   with a resolving power of 40,000 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio per 1.8  km@xmath9 pixel is 60 at 5900   .",
    "standard data reduction procedures are carried out with the iraf echelle package as described by @xcite .",
    "equivalent widths for isolated absorption lines are measured by fitting gaussian profiles .",
    "a standard abundance analysis was made for the measured equivalent widths using the model atmospheres of @xcite .",
    "the analysis was made primarily based on the line list of @xcite .",
    "we added some weak fe i lines , which enable one to determine the micro - turbulence more accurately .",
    "the effective temperature ( @xmath10 ) of 4300  k , determined by @xcite , was adopted in the analysis . the micro - turbulence ( @xmath11 ) and gravity ( @xmath12 )",
    "are determined so that the derived fe abundance is not dependent on the strengths of fe i lines nor on the ionization stage , respectively .",
    "the results ( @xmath13  dex and @xmath14  km",
    "s@xmath9 ) agree with those of @xcite within the estimated errors .",
    "the metallicity is assumed to be the fe abundance ( [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "the fe abundance derived by the present analysis is [ fe / h]@xmath15 , adopting the solar abundance of @xmath16(fe ) = 7.45 @xcite .",
    "the results of the abundance analysis are given in table [ tab : res ] .",
    "the th abundance is determined from the th ii 5989   line .",
    "the oscillator strengths of th lines , including the 5989   line , are obtained by @xcite .",
    "this line was investigated by @xcite for the field metal - poor star hd  221170 .",
    "the line was measured for the same object , using a higher quality spectrum , by @xcite , who reported that the abundance determined from this line agrees with those from other th ii lines .",
    "we performed an analysis for hd  221170 using the spectrum obtained with the subaru telescope and the model atmosphere @xcite with the parameters adopted by @xcite , and confirmed that the derived th abundance agrees very well with their result .",
    "we note that the partition function of the th ii was calculated using the energy levels listed by @xcite .",
    "though telluric absorption lines , probably due to water vapor , exist in this wavelength range , we found that the th ii 5989   line of cos  82 is not distinctively affected by them .",
    "figure  [ fig : sp ] shows the observed spectrum along with the synthetic ones for three th abundances .",
    "the data for spectral lines other than the th ii line were adopted from the list of @xcite .",
    "the wavelength of the observed spectrum is determined from 137 fe i lines in the spectrum .",
    "we identified the absorption feature at 5989.3   as a nd ii line .",
    "although a nd ii line at 5989.378   with the lower excitation potential of 6005.270 cm@xmath9 is listed by @xcite , j. e. lawler ( private communication ) suggests that the line should be the transition from 19758.540 to 3066.755 cm@xmath9 at @xmath18 5989.312   .",
    "since the transition probability of this line is unknown , we assume it to be @xmath19 .",
    "this @xmath20-value and the nd abundance determined from other spectral regions well reproduce the strength of the line for cos  82 as well as for hd  221170 .    the th abundance is determined by @xmath21-fitting of synthetic spectra to the observed one from 5988.9 to 5989.2   , which is not severely affected by the 5989.3   feature .",
    "the derived abundance is @xmath22(th)@xmath23 .",
    "the 2@xmath24 level of the fitting error is 0.07  dex .",
    "the continuum level is estimated for the spectrum around the absorption features .",
    "the uncertainty of the continuum placement ( @xmath25% ) results in an possible error of 0.03  dex in the th abundance .",
    "we estimate the line broadening for relatively clean lines in the spectrum , and found that the line widths are primarily determined by the instrumental broadening , and no significant broadening by macro - turbulence nor rotation is detected .",
    "the possible errors in the th abundance due to the adopted broadening parameter ( @xmath26  km  s@xmath9 ) is 0.03  dex .",
    "the abundances of other elements are determined using the line list of @xcite with some modifications .",

    "an upper limit of the os abundance is derived from the os i 5584   line .",
    "estimates of upper limits for other neutron - capture elements are also attempted , but no meaningful result is derived from our spectrum .",
    "the abundances of fe and most neutron - capture elements derived by the present analysis agrees with the results of @xcite within the errors ( see below ) .",
    "exceptions are eu and gd abundances , for which the differences between the two measurements are about 0.25  dex",
    ". this would be due to the difference of the spectral features and line data adopted in the analysis .",
    "the abundances of fe and some neutron - capture elements determined by @xcite agree well with our results , while their ce and sm abundances are more than 0.3  dex higher than ours .",
    "we suspect that their results are uncertain because of the low s / n ratio in the blue region of their spectrum where ce and sm lines used in their analysis exist .",
    "the abundance uncertainties for elements for which more than 10 lines are measured are estimated by @xmath27 , where @xmath24 is the standard deviation of the abundances from individual lines and @xmath28 is the number of lines used .",
    "a typical uncertainty of the equivalent width measurement from our spectrum is 6  m .",
    "we performed abundance analyses for fe i lines with equivalent widths from 30 to 200  m , changing the equivalent widths by 6  m .",
    "the effects of the change of equivalent widths on the derived abundances are 0.150.20  dex , which agree with the @xmath24 ( 0.18  dex ) for fe i ( @xmath29 ) . for elements",
    "whose abundances are determined from less than 10 lines , the random error is estimated by @xmath30 .",
    "errors due to the uncertainty of atmospheric parameters are estimated by calculating abundances changing atmospheric parameters by @xmath31=150  k , @xmath32=0.3  dex , @xmath33([fe / h])=0.2  dex , and @xmath34  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "these errors are added , in quadrature , to the random errors estimated above , and are given in table  [ tab : res ] ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "we found , however , that the abundances of the neutron - capture elements determined from the ionized species systematically scales by changes of the adopted atmospheric parameters .",
    "for the discussion based on the abundance pattern , we calculate the average of the abundance changes for heavy neutron - capture elements ( la  er ) by changing the atmospheric parameters , and adopt the deviation from this systematic abundance change for individual elements as the errors due to the uncertainties of atmospheric parameters .",

    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : pattern ] shows the abundance patterns of neutron - capture elements for cos  82 , the solar - system r - process component @xcite , and the two r - process - enhanced field stars cs  22892052 @xcite and cs  31082001 @xcite .",

    "as reported by @xcite , the overall abundance pattern of heavy neutron - capture elements ( ba  er ) in cos  82 agrees well with the r - process abundance pattern . in the lower panel , the abundance differences between cos  82 and the solar - system r - process component , as well as that between cos  82 and cs  22892052 , are shown . the th abundance of cos  82 is lower than the normalized value of the solar - system r - process component , while that agrees very well with the value of cs  22892052",
    "this point is discussed below in more detail .",
    "the abundance of the light neutron - capture element y in cos  82 is also lower than the normalized value in the solar - system r - process component as found in field r - process - enhanced stars .",
    "although such small deviation exists , an important result derived from the comparison is that the abundance pattern of neutron - capture elements , including th , in cos  82 agrees with the pure r - process abundance pattern .",
    "according to model calculations for the r - process , the actinide abundances with respect to other neutron - capture elements are very sensitive to the model parameters ( e.g. electron fraction , entropy ; wanajo et al .",
    "the agreement of the th abundance ratio to other neutron - capture elements in cos  82 with that of cs  22892052 indicates that the mechanism and astrophysical sites that are responsible for the heavy elements in cos  82 is common with those for the r - process - enhanced field stars .",
    "recent abundance studies for r - process - enhanced stars suggest that the r - process occurs under a quite limited condition ( e.g. supernova explosions whose progenitors have mass in a very narrow range ) .",
    "our result shows that this is also applied to stars even in dsph .",
    "the metallicity of cos  82 is more than one order of magnitude higher than those in the field r - ii stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath41 ) .",
    "the chemical composition of field stars with such metallicity is believed to be affected by a number of nucleosynthesis events .",
    "however , the metallicity , as well as the amount of neutron - capture elements , should be related to how the yields from a nucleosynthesis event are captured by the clouds from which next generation , low mass stars formed , and the neutron - capture elements of cos  82 might be provided by a single event .",
    "for instance , @xcite proposed that the large excesses of neutron - capture elements in a few objects in dsph , including cos  82 , are the result of a larger velocity dispersion of the gas from which low mass stars like cos  82 formed in dsph than in the galactic halo .",
    "that is , the yields of one supernova are recorded in the next generations of stars with smaller mixing with metal - deficient ( or metal - free ) gas in dsph .",
    "finally , we discuss an estimate of the age of cos  82 from the abundance ratio between th and other stable elements , which could be an independent calibration for the age measurements for this galaxy .",
    "if the age of this star is shown to be quite long ( @xmath42  gyr ) , the star formation of this dsph should be completed with a short time scale .",
    "th has a half life of 14.05 gyr , and the age of the object ( more strictly , the duration from the r - process event ) is estimated from the th abundance ratio to other stable elements , if its initial abundance ratio is given . here",
    "the average of abundances of the nine elements from la to er is used as the reference ( e@xmath43 ) .",
    "the th / e@xmath44 ratio of cos  82 agrees very well with that of cs  22892052 , while that is 0.3  dex lower than the value in the r - process component in solar - system material ( figure  [ fig : pattern ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the abundance ratio of th / e@xmath43 produced by the r - process is not constant .",
    "indeed , the actinides including th are significantly enhanced , with respect to other neutron - capture elements , in the r - ii star cs  31082001 , compared to that of the solar - system r - process component @xcite .",
    "however , studies of th abundances for a number of r - process enhanced field stars show that the abundance ratios distribute in a rather narrow range ( @xmath45th / e@xmath46 ) , and cs  22892052 is one of the objects that have the lowest ratio . assuming that the initial abundance ratio of th / e@xmath43 for cos  82 is within this range , and that the field halo stars including cs  22892052 are quite old ( their ages are around 1213 gyr ) , cos  82 is also an old object .",
    "( if a higher value of the initial th / e@xmath43 ratio is assumed , the derived age becomes longer ) .    the error ( @xmath40 ) in the determination of the th abundance ratio is 0.08  dex , while the scatter of the abundances of the above nine stable elements around those of the solar - system r - process component , as well as of cs  22892052 , is 0.11  dex .",
    "we estimate the error of the th / e@xmath43 to be 0.13  dex , which results in the uncertainty of the age estimate to be 6 gyr .",
    "hence , though the object is suggested to be as old as field halo stars , the age estimate using th chronometer gives only a weak constraint .",
    "a measurement of u / th ratio , which is a more sensitive chronometer , for this object will enable one to estimate the age with a much smaller error ( @xmath47 2 gyr ) .",
