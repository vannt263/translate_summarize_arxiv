    "lepton flavour universality ( lfu ) is a distinctive feature of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the different lepton families couple with exactly the same strength to the gauge bosons .",
    "this leads to concrete predictions in electroweak precision tests , which can only distinguish among lepton families by the different charged lepton masses .",
    "any deviation from the expected sm theoretical results would signal the presence of new physics ( np ) . in this work we concentrate on light meson ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 )",
    "leptonic decays which , in view of the expected experimental precision , have a unique potential to probe deviations from the sm regarding lepton universality .    in the sm ,",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath7 ( @xmath2 ) arises from @xmath8 boson exchange .",
    "one may be afraid about potential hadronic uncertainties ; however , by considering the ratios @xmath9 the hadronic uncertainties are expected to cancel out to a good approximation . in order to compare the experimental bounds with the sm predictions ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce a quantity , @xmath10 , which parametrizes deviations from the sm expectations : @xmath11 the comparison of theoretical analyses  @xcite with the recent measurements from the na62 collaboration  @xcite and with the existing measurements on pion leptonic decays  @xcite @xmath12 suggests that observation agrees at @xmath13 level with the sm s predictions for @xmath14 the current experimental uncertainty in @xmath15 ( of around 0.4% ) will be further reduced in the near future , as one expects to have @xmath16  @xcite , which can translate into measuring deviations @xmath17 . similarly , there are also plans for a more precise determination of @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "new contributions to @xmath19 have been extensively discussed in the literature , especially in the framework of models with an enlarged higgs sector . in the presence of charged scalar higgs ,",
    "new tree - level contributions are expected . however , as in the case of most two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) , or supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the sm , these new tree - level corrections are lepton universal  @xcite . in susy models ,",
    "higher order non - holomorphic couplings can indeed provide new contributions to @xmath20  @xcite , but in view of current experimental bounds ( collider , @xmath21-physics and @xmath22-lepton decays ) , one can have at most @xmath23 in the framework of unconstrained minimal susy models  @xcite .",
    "corrections to the @xmath0 vertex can also induce violation of lfu in charged currents . however , if these appear at the loop level , as referred to in  @xcite , the effect is expected to be of order @xmath24 ( @xmath25 being the new physics scale ) , generally well below experimental sensitivity .",
    "here we consider a different alternative : the tree - level corrections to charged current interactions once neutrino oscillations are incorporated into the sm @xcite . in this case , and working in the basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , the flavour - conserving term @xmath26 now reads @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a generic leptonic mixing matrix , @xmath29 denoting the physical neutrino states ( not necessarily corresponding to the three left - handed sm states @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 the charged lepton flavour . in the case of three neutrino generations",
    ", @xmath28 corresponds to the unitary pmns matrix and flavour universality is preserved in meson decays : since one can not tag the flavour of the final state neutrino ( missing energy ) , the meson decay amplitude is proportional to @xmath32 , and thus no new contribution to @xmath20 is expected .",
    "however , in the presence of sterile states , the @xmath0 vertex is proportional to a rectangular @xmath33 matrix @xmath28 , and the mixing between the left - handed leptons @xmath34 corresponds to a @xmath35 block of @xmath28 , @xmath36 the larger the mixing between the active ( left - handed ) neutrinos and the new states , the more pronounced the deviations from unitarity of @xmath37 , parametrized by the matrix @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "the active - sterile mixings and the departure from unitarity of @xmath37 can be at the source of the violation of lfu in different neutrino mass models which introduce sterile fermionic states to generate non - zero masses and mixings for the light neutrinos @xcite .",
    "corrections to the @xmath0 vertex can arise in several scenarios with additional ( light ) singlet states , as is the case of @xmath39sm  @xcite , low - scale type - i seesaw  @xcite and the inverse seesaw ( iss )  @xcite , among other possibilities .",
    "this clearly shows the potentiality of the mechanism under discussion , which can be present in many different models .    in the next section we provide a model - independent computation of @xmath40 in the presence of additional fermionic sterile states ; we then briefly review in section  [ sec : constraints ] the most important experimental and observational constraints on the mass of the additional singlet states . in section  [ sec : drkiss ] , we consider the case of the inverse seesaw to give a numerical example of the impact of sterile neutrinos on @xmath40 .",
    "our concluding remarks are summarised in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "let us consider the sm extended by @xmath41 additional sterile states .",
    "the matrix element for the meson decay @xmath42 can be generically written as @xmath43 no sum is implied over the indices of the outgoing leptons @xmath44 .",
    "notice that @xmath45 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be easily obtained from the usual 4-fermion effective hamiltonian obtained after integrating out the @xmath8 boson in eq . .",
    "these are @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the meson decay constant and @xmath50 the mass of the outgoing leptons .    the expression for @xmath20 is finally given by @xmath51 @xmath52 \\left [ ( m_p^2 - m_{l_j}^2 -    m_{\\nu_i}^2)^2 - 4 m_{l_j}^2 m_{\\nu_i}^2 \\right]^{1/2}\\ , .",

    "( [ eq : rpresult ] ) has a straightforward interpretation : @xmath53 represents the impact of new interactions ( absent in the sm ) , whereas @xmath54 encodes the mass - dependent factors .",
    "the sm result can be easily recovered from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rpresult ] ) , in the limit @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 to which small electromagnetic corrections should be added  @xcite .    using the results in eqs .   and",
    ", we obtain a general expression for @xmath19 @xmath58 thus , depending on the masses of the new states ( and their hierarchy ) and most importantly , on their mixings to the active neutrinos , @xmath19 can considerably deviate from zero . in order to illustrate this , we consider two regimes :    * * regime ( a ) : * all sterile neutrinos are _ lighter _ than the decaying meson , but heavier than the active neutrino states , i.e. @xmath59 * * regime ( b ) : * all sterile neutrinos are _ heavier _ than @xmath60    notice that in case ( a ) , all the mass eigenstates can be kinematically available and one should sum over all @xmath61 states ; furthermore there is an enhancement to @xmath19 arising from phase space factors , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : fg ] ) .",
    "we review in this section the experimental and observational bounds on the mass regimes and on the size of the active - sterile mixings that must be satisfied .",
    "first , it is clear that present data on neutrino masses and mixings  @xcite should be accounted for .",
    "second , there are robust laboratory bounds from direct sterile neutrinos searches @xcite , since the latter can be produced in meson decays such as @xmath62 , with rates dependent on their mixing with the active neutrinos .",
    "negative searches for monochromatic lines in the muon spectrum can be translated into bounds for @xmath63 combinations , where @xmath64 parametrizes the active - sterile mixing .",
    "the non - unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix is also subject to constraints .",
    "bounds on the non - unitarity parameter @xmath38 ( eq .  ( [ eq : u : eta : pmns ] ) ) , were derived using non - standard interactions  @xcite ; although not relevant in case ( a ) , these bounds will be taken into account when evaluating scenario ( b ) .",
    "the modified @xmath0 vertex also contributes to lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) processes .",
    "the radiative decay @xmath65 , searched for by the meg experiment  @xcite , is typically the most constraining observable   conversion experiments can also play a relevant rle in detecting or constraining sterile neutrino scenarios  @xcite .",
    "this is also the case in the supersymmetric version of these models , even when the sterile neutrinos are heavier @xcite . ] .",
    "the rate induced by sterile neutrinos must satisfy  @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 , with @xmath68 the loop function and @xmath69 the mixing matrix defined in eq . .",
    "similarly , any change in the @xmath0 vertex will also affect other leptonic meson decays , in particular @xmath70 ; the following bounds were enforced in the analysis : @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "important constraints can also be derived from lhc higgs searches  @xcite and electroweak precision data  @xcite .",
    "they will also be considered in our numerical analysis .    under the assumption of a standard cosmology , the most constraining bounds on sterile neutrinos stem from a wide variety of cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "these include large scale structure data , x - ray searches ( which can be produced in @xmath74 ) , lyman-@xmath75 limits , the existence of additional degrees of freedom at the epoch of big bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background data .",
    "however , all the above cosmological bounds can be evaded if a non - standard cosmology is considered .",
    "in fact , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the above cosmological constraints disappear in scenarios with low reheating temperature .",
    "therefore , we will allow for the violation of the latter bounds , explicitly stating it .",
    "although the generic idea explored in this work applies to any model where the active neutrinos have sizeable mixings with some additional singlet states , we consider the case of the inverse seesaw  @xcite to illustrate the potential of a model with sterile neutrinos regarding tree - level contributions to light meson decays . as mentioned before , there are other possibilities  @xcite .      in the iss",
    ", the sm particle content is extended by @xmath76 generations of right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos @xmath77 and @xmath78 generations of singlet fermions @xmath79 with lepton number @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively  @xcite ( such that @xmath82 ) . in our numerical application we will focus on the case @xmath83 .",
    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 are generation indices and @xmath86 .",
    "notice that the present lepton number assignment , together with @xmath81 for the sm lepton doublet , implies that the `` dirac''-type right - handed neutrino mass term @xmath87 conserves lepton number , while the `` majorana '' mass term @xmath88 violates it by two units .    the left - handed neutrinos mix with the right - handed ones after electroweak symmetry breaking",
    ". this leads to an effective majorana mass for the active ( light ) neutrinos . assuming @xmath89 , where @xmath90 , with @xmath91 the vacuum expectation value of the sm higgs boson , one obtains @xmath92 the remaining 6 sterile states have masses approximately given by @xmath93 .",
    "small corrections can be added to these results , but they are typically negligible @xcite .    in what follows , and without loss of generality , we work in a basis where @xmath94 is a diagonal matrix ( as are the charged lepton yukawa couplings ) .",
    "@xmath95 can be written using a modified casas - ibarra parametrisation  @xcite ( thus automatically complying with light neutrino data ) , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a diagonal matrix containing the square roots of the three eigenvalues of @xmath98 ( cf .",
    "; likewise @xmath99 is a ( diagonal ) matrix with the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath101 diagonalizes @xmath102 as @xmath103 , and @xmath104 is a @xmath35 complex orthogonal matrix , parametrized by @xmath105 complex angles , encoding the remaining degrees of freedom .",
    "the nine neutrino mass eigenstates enter the leptonic charged current through their left - handed component ( see eq . , with @xmath106 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "the unitary leptonic mixing matrix @xmath69 is now defined as @xmath107 .",
    "notice however that only the rectangular @xmath108 sub - matrix ( first three columns of @xmath69 ) appears in eq . due to the gauge - singlet nature of @xmath77 and @xmath79 .",
    "we numerically evaluate the contributions to @xmath109 in the framework of the iss and address the two scenarios discussed before , which can be translated in terms of ranges for the ( random ) entries of the @xmath94 matrix : _ regime ( a ) _ ( @xmath110 ) - @xmath111 $ ] mev ; _ regime ( b ) _ ( @xmath112 ) - @xmath113 $ ] gev",

    "the adapted casas - ibarra parametrisation for @xmath95 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ci : param ] ) , ensures that neutrino oscillation data is satisfied ( we use the best - fit values of the global analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite and set the cp violating phases of @xmath118 to zero ) .",
    "the @xmath104 matrix angles are taken to be real ( thus no contributions to lepton electric dipole moments are expected ) , and randomly varied in the range @xmath119 $ ] .",
    "we have verified that similar @xmath15 contributions are found when considering the more general complex @xmath104 matrix case .    in figs .",
    "[ figure12 ] , we collect our results for @xmath15 in scenarios ( a ) - left panel - and ( b ) - right panel , as a function of @xmath120 , which parametrizes the departure from unitarity of the active neutrino mixing sub - matrix @xmath37 , @xmath121 .",
    "although the cosmological constraints are not always satisfied , we stress that all points displayed comply with the different experimental and laboratory bounds discussed before .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     for the case of scenario ( a ) , one can have very large contributions to @xmath109 , which can even reach values @xmath122 ( in some extreme cases we find @xmath15 as large as @xmath123 ) .",
    "the hierarchy of the sterile neutrino spectrum in case ( a ) is such that one can indeed have a significant amount of lfu violation , while still avoiding non - unitarity bounds .",
    "although this scenario would in principle allow to produce sterile neutrinos in light meson decays , the smallness of the associated @xmath95 ( @xmath124 ) , together with the loop function suppression ( @xmath68 ) , precludes the observation of lfv processes , even those with very good associated experimental sensitivity , as is the case of @xmath65",
    ". the strong constraints from cmb and x - rays would exclude scenario ( a ) ; in order to render it viable , one would require a non - standard cosmology .",
    "despite the fact that in case ( b ) the hierarchy of the sterile states is such that non - unitarity bounds become very stringent ( since the sterile neutrinos are not kinematically viable meson decay final states ) , sizeable lfu violation is also possible , with deviations from the sm predictions again as large as @xmath125 .",
    "although one can not produce sterile states in meson decays in this case , the large @xmath95 open the possibility of having larger contributions to lfv observables so that , for example , br(@xmath126 can be within meg reach .",
    "although we do not explicitly display it here , the prospects for @xmath127 are similar : in the same framework , one could have @xmath128 , and thus @xmath129 in both scenarios . depending on the singlet spectrum , these observables can also be strongly correlated : if all the sterile states are either lighter than the pion ( as it is the case of scenario ( a ) ) or then heavier than the kaon , one finds @xmath130 .",
    "this is a distinctive feature of our mechanism .",
    "the existence of sterile neutrinos can potentially lead to a significant violation of lepton flavour universality at tree - level in light meson decays . as shown in this study , provided that the active - sterile mixings are sufficiently large , the modified @xmath131 interaction can lead to large contributions to lepton flavour universality observables , with measurable deviations from the standard model expectations , well within experimental sensitivity .",
    "this mechanism might take place in many different frameworks , the exact contributions for a given observable being model - dependent .    as an illustrative ( numerical ) example",
    ", we have evaluated the contributions to @xmath109 in the inverse seesaw extension of the sm - a truly minimal extension of the sm - , for distinct hierarchies of the sterile states .",
    "our analysis reveals that very large deviations from the sm predictions can be found ( @xmath132 - or even larger , well within reach of the na62 experiment at cern .",
    "this is in clear contrast with other models of new physics ( for example unconstrained susy models , where one typically has @xmath133 ) .",
