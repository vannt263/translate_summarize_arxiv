    "there is growing interest in quasielastic electron scattering experiments with momentum transfers of order one gev / c or larger .",
    "clearly these require a relativistic treatment .",
    "indeed , there have been many relativistic mean field and rpa calculations of quasielastic scattering  @xcite .",
    "these calculations often have large scalar @xmath0 and vector @xmath1 mean fields which shift the mass of a nucleon from @xmath2  to @xmath3 , @xmath4 this changes the position of the quasielastic peak from @xmath5(with @xmath6  the momentum and @xmath7  the energy transfer ) to @xmath8 this change agrees well with the  binding - energy \" shift seen in a variety of experiments at moderate momentum transfers @xmath9mev / c .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ qpeak ] ) predicts very large shifts for momentum transfers of order 1000 mev / c or larger .",
    "such large shifts are not seen in data  @xcite .",
    "one would like to understand this limitation and develop a simple relativistic mean field model that is applicable over a broad range of momentum transfers .",
    "indeed , most of the relativistic models assume the self - energies or mean fields ( @xmath10 ) are independent of energy or momentum . this approximation is probably good at low momentum transfers but fails as the momentum transfer increases .",
    "dirac optical model fits to proton - nucleus elastic scattering  @xcite produce scalar and vector optical potentials which have much less energy dependence than the nonrelativistic mean field .",
    "when the dirac equation is reduced to a schrodinger like form the effective nonrelativistic mean field is  @xcite @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the total energy of the nucleon ( @xmath13 ) . the linear energy dependence for @xmath14  implied by eq .",

[ self ] .",
    "( however , results we present are not sensitive to this region . )",
    "note , the optical fit has imaginary parts for @xmath0 and @xmath1 which we ignore .",
    "it remains to investigate the effects of these complex potentials .",
    "we use the fit potentials at the center of @xmath17ca .",
    "however we scale these results by @xmath47 , @xmath48 to represent an average over the nuclear volume . here",
    "@xmath49is taken from a relativistic mean field calculation of @xmath17ca  @xcite .",
    "we assume the potentials scale with the density and then use a fermi momentum of @xmath50 in our calculations rather than a typical nuclear matter value @xmath51  mev / c with @xmath52 .",
    "this represents an average over the central and low density surface regions .    the polarizations in eq .",
    "( [ pol ] ) are calculated numerically using the greens function in eq .",

    "the parameters of the calculation are the fermi momentum @xmath40 , @xmath47 and the two functions @xmath44  and @xmath45  from the dirac optical fit .",
    "this yields a simple relativistic impulse approximation that will be applied to data over a large range of momentum transfers in the next section .",
    "in this section we present results for three calculations .",
    "the first is a free fermi gas with @xmath53 .",
    "the second is the mean field theory ( mft ) with momentum independent @xmath1  and @xmath0  given by eqs .",
    "( [ vector ] ) ,  ( [ scalar ] ) ( scaled by the @xmath47 of eq .  ( [ alp ] ) ) .",
    "finally , we consider momentum dependent @xmath44  and @xmath45 .",
    "the longitudinal response for @xmath16fe at @xmath54  mev / c is shown in fig .",
    "[ fe550 ] .",
    "the free fermi gas somewhat underestimates the average excitation energy of the response .",
    "this is better described by either the full momentum dependent calculation or the mft .",
    "indeed at this relatively low excitation energy of about 200 mev there are not too large differences between the momentum dependent @xmath44 , @xmath45  and the mft potentials .",
    "therefore , either the mft or the momentum dependent calculation can describe the average excitation energy of low momentum transfer data .",
    "we have used a simple local density approximation .",
    "this is expected to reproduce qualitatively the position of the quasielastic peak .",
    "full relativistic finite nucleus calculations ( for momentum independent potentials ) ref .",
    "@xcite agree well with the local density peak positions and do a good job of reproducing the detailed shape of the response .",
    "note , the area under the longitudinal response is controversial .",
    "it is subject to systematic experimental errors and coulomb distortion corrections .",
    "however , there is general agreement that ( near this momentum transfer ) there is a substantial binding energy shift compared to a free fermi gas .",
    "this is seen either in separated longitudinal and transverse responses or in unseparated cross sections .    next , fig .",
    "[ fe1140 ] shows the longitudinal response at a momentum transfer of @xmath55  gev / c . at this",
    "momentum transfer the mft response is at substantially too high an excitation energy .",
    "in contrast , either the momentum dependent or the free fermi gas calculation provides a reasonable description of the position of the quasielastic peak .",
    "thus the reduction of @xmath44  and @xmath45  with increasing energy or momentum ( as shown in fig .  [ self ] ) corrects ( at least in large measure ) the tendency for the mft to overpredict the binding energy shift . at still higher momentum transfers ,",
    "we expect small differences between the momentum dependent calculation and a free fermi gas because @xmath44  and @xmath45continue to decrease .    the transverse response for @xmath17ca",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ tran ] for @xmath56550 mev / c .",
    "again , at this @xmath57  the mft and momentum dependent calculations are similar .",
    "note , there is substantial extra strength in the transverse response at high excitation energies from meson exchange currents and delta production , see for example  @xcite .",
    "these are not contained in our simple model .",
    "note , a free fermi gas reproduces the peak position well at high @xmath57 .",
    "however , there is no theoretical motivation for simply ignoring the mean fields which are known to be present .",
    "furthermore , a free fermi gas will fail at low @xmath57  where it is generally believed one needs a binding energy shift .",
    "thus , we think , the only theoretically consistent model is one which includes mean fields and takes into account their momentum dependence .    alternatively , some nonrelativistic models simply assume a momentum independent excitation energy shift equal to the average binding energy of a nucleon .",
    "this works reasonably well at low @xmath57  and possibly could be extended to high @xmath57  by using some form of relativistic kinematics",
    ". however , there is no theoretical justification for this prescription . strictly speaking one would have to assume an energy dependent potential which is big for bound states and then goes rapidly to zero for positive energies",
    "this is unrealistic .",
    "thus , we believe , a theoretically consistent description will have to address explicitly the momentum or energy dependence of the mean fields .",
    "we now discuss current conservation .",
    "the full electromagnetic vertex should satisfy the ward - takahashi identity , @xmath58 this is no longer true for the vertex @xmath59 , of eq .",
    "( [ ver ] ) given that @xmath36  is calculated with momentum dependent potentials ( and that eq .",
    "( [ ver ] ) has form factors ) .",
    "clearly we must add a vertex correction .",
    "however , there is no unique way to calculate this correction without detailed knowledge of the processes included in @xmath44 and @xmath45 and in @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "instead , we add a very minimal vertex correction so that not eq .",
    "( [ ward ] ) but at least current conservation is satisfied , @xmath62 here , the spinors @xmath63  satisfy a dirac equation with @xmath10  and @xmath64 we choose , @xmath65\\ .\\label{dgam}\\ ] ] this simple prescription insures , @xmath66 calculations using eqs .",

    "does not contribute to @xmath23  when dotted into the conserved electron current .",
    "however , eqs .",
    "( [ cross ] ) , ( [ long ] ) assumed current conservation .",
    "one gets a different answer for @xmath23  from eq .",
    "( [ long ] ) if one sets @xmath68because in this case the current is not conserved . ]",
    "therefore , we do not expect large errors from our ( slight ) violation of current conservation .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ dgam ] ) is non - unique and this point deserves further study , see below .",
    "there have been many relativistic mean field calculations for inclusive quasielastic electron scattering .",
    "ironically , although these do a reasonable job at low to moderate momentum transfers , many of these relativistic calculations are not appropriate for momentum transfers near one gev / c or above .",
    "this is because they assume the mean fields are independent of momentum or energy . as a result",
    "they predict too large a binding energy shift in the position of the quasielastic peak .",
    "instead , we assume a simple model where the momentum dependence of the scalar and vector mean fields are taken from an optical model fit to p-@xmath17ca elastic scattering .",
    "the inclusive response is calculated in a relativistic impulse approximation .",
    "reasonable predictions are made for the position of the quasielastic peak at both low and high @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the model can be used over a large range of momentum transfers .",
    "our calculations are for nuclear matter in a local density approximation .",
    "we expect this to qualitatively reproduce the position of the quasielastic peak but not its detailed shape .",
    "one should repeat the calculations in a full finite nucleus formalism , such as from reference  @xcite , using energy dependent potentials .",
    "we have only briefly mentioned vertex corrections .",
    "these are needed for current conservation in momentum dependent mean fields .",
    "future work should calculate the vertex correction in a full microscopic model .",
    "for example , one can choose a ( somewhat unusual ) set of meson couplings ( including nonlinear self - couplings ) so that a relativistic hartree - fock ( hf ) calculation approximately reproduces the momentum dependence of the mean fields .",
