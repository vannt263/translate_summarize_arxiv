    "a finite amount of positive energy is infused into the system at the measurement device position . because the properties of states excited by local measurement are the same as those of the vacuum outside the excited regions , those states can be called local vacuum states . the concept of local vacuum states is the same of that of strictly localized states proposed by knight @xcite . in this paper , it is proven for a free massless scalar field in 1 + 1 dimensions that the excitation energy can be partly extracted back from the field using the measurement results and a quantum apparatus located away from the measurement point , _ even if the field has , on average , no energy around the apparatus at all_. using this method , we can transport energy to a distant location by sending not a physical object with excitation energy , but classical information . in the extraction process ,",
