    "birth and death are the most relevant processes in determining the dynamics of biological populations which in the context of statistical physics can be modeled using interacting particle models where particle number is changing in time .",
    "as it is understood by now , birth and death processes are also responsible for clustering mechanisms in systems where random - walking individuals undergo reproduction and death . as a result , aggregation of organisms can occur even in simple models where birth and death processes are combined with spatial diffusion .",
    "in fact , in the most simple _ brownian bug model _ , where particles reproduce and die with the same probability and undergo brownian motion @xcite , clustering of particles was observed . in this model the clustering is produced simply by the reproductive correlations ( the offspring is born at the same location of the parent ) and by the irreversibility of the death process .",
    "birth and death models of moving individuals are the pertinent framework to capture properties of biological systems such as planktonic populations @xcite , or patterns in amoebae @xcite and bacteria @xcite .    taking into account another central ingredient that is present in ecological systems , namely , the competition with other individuals in the neighborhood for resources , the formation of periodic spatial structures was observed in refs .  @xcite . in these _ nonlocally interacting brownian bug models _ it was assumed that the reproduction probability depends on the number of other organisms in the neighborhood . in ref .",
    "@xcite _ nonlocally interacting lvy bugs _ ,",
    "i.e. , reproducing and dying organisms that undergo lvy flights , were studied .",
    "this type of motion is relevant to model cell migration  @xcite , biological searching strategies  @xcite , bacteria dynamics  @xcite , or pattern formation of mussels @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the formation of a periodic pattern is robust with respect to the type of spatial motion that the particles perform .",
    "the periodic arrangement of clusters in these nonlocally interacting bug models is a consequence of the competitive interaction and has a spatial scale determined by the interaction range @xcite .",
    "however , a deeper analysis of the differences and similarities between the brownian and lvy cases is still missing .",
    "in particular , as shown in @xcite , this analysis can be very conveniently performed by considering the limit of the interaction distance reaching the system size ( global interaction ) , since a unique cluster appears which helps to understand and characterize the cluster properties , and the fluctuations of the population size .    in the present paper we report on differences between the systems of brownian and lvy bugs , in the situations of global and non - local interactions , as well as in the noninteracting case .",
    "in addition , results on the dependence of population on diffusion , and mixing of _ families _ of particles are presented for the finite - range interaction case .",

    "the new bug is located at the same position @xmath21 as the parent individual @xmath17 .",

    "it gives to the tail of the jump distribution the same prefactor as for the lvy - stable distribution @xcite , but any other positive value of @xmath50 should lead to the same results reported here .",
    "one can generate a random step - length @xmath22 by inverting ( [ plambda - pareto ] ) : @xmath51 with @xmath52 being a uniform random variable on the unit interval .",
    "now the diffusion coefficient ( [ kappa ] ) is infinite , but one can define a generalized diffusion coefficient in terms of the scales @xmath28 and @xmath53 as @xcite @xmath54 therefore , in the case of the lvy flights , when fixing the value of @xmath55 , the space - scale parameter is : @xmath56 as we consider the bugs to be point - like , the spatial dynamics does not include any interaction between them . the interaction is instead taken into account through reproduction and death rates , which we assume to be affected by competitive interactions .",

    "[ figbbxy-6]a one can see that many small clusters form some time after starting from a uniform initial distribution .",
    "the occurrence of the clustering is related to the fact that in the case of reproduction the new bug is located at the same position as the parent . due to the fluctuations and irreversibility of death",
    "the number of clusters decreases in time , until there will be a single cluster consisting of individuals coming from a single ancestor .",

    "the smaller the value of @xmath81 the more anomalous the system , i.e. , the larger is the probability for long jumps and therefore there are more flash - clusters .",
    "when the number of clusters has already decreased to one , due to the long jumps and fluctuation of the number of individuals , new clusters that are placed far from the central cluster can appear in the system also for some time and often the disappearance of the main cluster takes place whereas another new central cluster appears somewhere else . as a result",
    "the center of mass undergoes anomalous diffusion as single bugs do . the value of the lvy index @xmath81 influences also the linear size of the main clusters : the smaller is @xmath81 , the more compact are the clusters , although also more particle jumps to long distances occur .",
    "the influence of the value of @xmath55 is similar as in the case of brownian bugs , i.e. , a larger value of the anomalous diffusion coefficient results in a larger linear size of the clusters .",

    "[ secflucn ] , an increase of the death rate , though accompanied by a compensating increase of birth rate , leads to larger fluctuations in the particle number .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]      it is interesting to study the evolution of the system also regarding the disappearance or survival of the different groups , by dividing initially the bugs into different families and following their descent . in the case of nonlocally interacting brownian bugs , a very low diffusion coefficient leads to the situation in which after cluster formation the inter - cluster travel is very rare because the individuals are not capable to make the jumps from one cluster to another one , and it is also very unlikely to arrive to the next cluster doing a multistep random walk because death is very probable between the clusters .",
    "therefore , in the case of very low diffusion different families would remain inside their initial clusters . if one assumes that initially each individual represents a different family , then only inter - cluster competition occurs and the final number of families is equal to the number of clusters .",
    "if instead initially individuals are assigned to families according to large areas of initial positions ( larger than typical cluster size as done in figs .",
    "[ figbbxy-6 ] and [ fig - global - xy ] at time @xmath79 ) , there is no family competition internal to the clusters , most families survive and the clusters coming from different families occupy approximately the territory of the ancestors even after a long time , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ figibbxy-4]a . in that case",
    ", the travel of a cluster to a new territory away from the other clusters of the same family can take place due to the diffusion of the cluster as a whole during the clusters arrangement into the periodic pattern .",
    "for larger values of @xmath35 the inter - cluster travel is possible which leads to the conquering of new territories , i.e. , bugs can be found in a region where their ancestors were not from , fig .",
    "[ figibbxy-4]b .",
    "the effect is larger for larger @xmath35 and leads to the disappearance of some families , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ figibbxy-4]c . finally ,",
    "for increased diffusion , intra - cluster competition will force all surviving bugs to be from a single family ( in fact , from a single ancestor ) ; which family ( ancestor ) wins is a random event .",
    "the process is faster for larger diffusion .",
    "increasing the diffusivity further even the periodic pattern disappears , fig .",
    "[ figibbxy-4]d .",
    "figure  [ xxx ] illustrates the family mixing for nonlocally interacting lvy bugs . in this case",
    "the inter - cluster traveling is supported by the long jumps . differently from the case of brownian bugs ,",
    "now the individuals can reach not only the next neighboring cluster but also clusters far away .",
    "consequently , a cluster originally consisting of bugs coming from one ancestor can after some time turn into a cluster consisting of bugs coming from different families placed initially far away .",
    "thus , intra - cluster bug competition becomes soon competition between families , and even if the diffusivity of the bugs is very low , at the end the lvy bug system would consist of individuals coming from one or just a few ancestors . as in the case of brownian bugs ,",
    "the process of the disappearance of families is faster the greater is the generalized diffusion coefficient .    besides the diffusion of a cluster as a whole during the formation of the periodic pattern and the conquering of new territories through the migration to and survival in another cluster ,",
    "the mixing of clusters from different families can take place also due to the appearance of a new cluster if in the periodic pattern there is a dislocation . in the case of brownian bugs",
    "the new cluster is formed through the splitting of an old cluster . in the case of lvy bugs , instead",
    ", the new cluster can appear also far from the original territory .",
    "we have presented some detailed properties of interacting particle systems in which the individuals are brownian or lvy random walkers which interact in a competitive manner .",
    "we have seen strong differences between the globally and the finite - range nonlocally interacting systems . in the systems with global interaction the spatial distribution of the bugs",
    "becomes tied to the type of diffusion , brownian or lvy .",
    "typical configurations consist of a single or a few clusters for both types of motion . for the lvy bug systems",
    "long tails appear in the mean cluster shape and in probability distributions of cluster width and of jumps of the center of mass . for brownian bug systems",
    "these quantities appear to be much shorter ranged .",
    "this is qualitatively also the situation in the noninteracting case , although then the effects of the particle - number fluctuations are much stronger . under non - local finite - range interactions",
    "the situation is rather different .",
    "first , single cluster configurations are generally replaced by periodic patterns with periodicity set by the interaction range @xmath57 .",
    "motion of individual clusters is severely restricted by the presence of the neighboring clusters .",
    "in addition , the natural spatial cut - off introduced by the interaction range @xmath57 seems to limit the influence of the long lvy jumps , so that measures of spatial cluster shape do not generally exhibit power laws , making spatial configurations under both types of diffusion more similar .",
    "mixing of families and their competition is nevertheless greatly influenced by the type of motion .",
    "this suggests that it would be interesting to consider the influence of different types of diffusion into competitive genetic mixing processes @xcite .",
    "obtaining analytic understanding in this type of interacting systems is difficult , but at least the nature of the instability leading to pattern formation and its relevant spatial scale have been clarified by using partial integro - differential equation descriptions of the mean field type @xcite , which are useful in broader contexts @xcite . however , from previous work in the gaussian case @xcite , it is known that quantities such as cluster width and structure or transition thresholds strongly depend on particle - number fluctuations .",
    "thus , obtaining additional results from differential equation approaches would need the inclusion of effective multiplicative noise terms @xcite or focus on statistical quantities such as pair correlation functions @xcite .",
