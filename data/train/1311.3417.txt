    "to study the dynamical behavior of galaxies it is necessary to build a model describing the properties of the system .",
    "information on the construction of dynamical models of galaxies are provided usually from observations , made after some necessary simplifying assumptions . on the other hand ,",
    "it is a fact that galactic dynamical models are successful and realistic , only if the modeled characteristics agree with the corresponding observational data .    in most cases ,",
    "the galactic models are spherical or axially symmetric , in an attempt to simplify the study of orbits .",
    "for instance , in a spherical system all three components of the angular momentum and of course the total angular momentum is conserved .",
    "thus , we have a plane motion , which takes place in the plane perpendicular to the vector of the total angular momentum .",
    "on the other hand , in an axially symmetric system , where the motion is described by a potential @xmath1 the @xmath2 component of the angular momentum is conserved and the motion takes place in the meridional plane @xmath3 , which rotates non - uniformly around the axis of symmetry with angular velocity @xmath4 .",
    "spherical models for galaxies were studied by [ @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ] . moreover ,",
    "interesting axially symmetric galaxy models were presented and studied by [ @xcite ] .",
    "recently , [ @xcite ] used data derived from rotation curves of real galaxies , in order to construct a new axially symmetric model describing the motion in both elliptical and disk galaxy systems .    of particular interest ,",
    "are the so - called composite galactic dynamical models . in those models",
    "the potential has several components each describing a part of the system .",
    "such a dynamical model composed of four components , that is a disk , a nucleus , a bulge and a dark halo was studied by [ @xcite ] .",
    "a new composite mass model describing motion in axially symmetric galaxies with dark matter was recently presented and studied by [ @xcite ] .",
    "composite axially symmetric galaxy models describing the orbital motion in the galaxy were also studied by [ @xcite ] . in these models",
    "the gravitational potential is generated by three superposed disks : one representing the gas layer , one the thin disk and one representing the thick disk .",
    "another interesting class of galaxy models is the self - consistent models . in order to built a self - consistent model , one must take into account jeans theorem ( see e.g. , [ @xcite ] ) . according to this theorem , the distribution function @xmath5 of a steady state galaxy ,",
    "depends on the integrals of motion , where only isolating integrals are taken into account .",
    "the self - consistent problem is one of the most difficult problems in galactic dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , there are several ways of approaching this problem .",
    "for instance , binney & tremaine used two different approaches in order to obtain the distribution function . using the first way",
    ", they start from @xmath5 in order to produce the mass density @xmath6 , while in the second they start from @xmath6 heading to @xmath5 .",
    "an effective technique to build self - consistent models for galaxies is the schwarzschild s orbit superposition method .",
    "this method has been applied in order to study the dynamical behavior in both axially symmetric and triaxial galaxies in a number of papers ( see e.g. , [ @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ] ) .",
    "self - consistent dynamical models for a disk galaxy with a triaxial halo were constructed by [ @xcite ] , where the starting point was a galaxy in equilibrium composed of an axially symmetric disk - bulge and a halo .",
    "then , applying an artificial acceleration he managed to obtain a system in equilibrium with a triaxial halo .",
    "realistic triaxial models for galaxies with dark matter haloes were provided in [ @xcite ] . in their article",
    ", the authors extended an earlier method used by [ @xcite ] to three - dimensional systems by replacing the radial with an ellipsoidal symmetry in the mass density .",
    "triaxial galaxy models were also constructed by [ @xcite ] and [ @xcite ] .",
    "the main goal of this article is to introduce a new composite mass model in order to use it for the dynamical investigation of galaxies .",
    "the model consists of two parts",
    ". the main galaxy body and a massive dense nucleus . the model can describe disk and elliptical galaxies as well .",
    "furthermore , the model is designed to describe not only galaxies that are close to axial symmetry but also systems with considerable deviation from axial symmetry .",
    "our target is to investigate the regular and chaotic character of orbits in the new model and connect the degree of chaos with the parameter describing the deviation of the model from axial symmetry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ galmod ] we present the structure and the properties of our new galactic mass model . in section [ compmeth ]",
    "we describe the computational methods we used in order to explore the nature of orbits . in the following section ,",
    "we investigate how the parameter describing the deviation from axially symmetry influences the regular or chaotic character of the 3d orbits .",
    "we conclude with section [ discus ] , where the discussion and the conclusions of this research are presented .",
    "our new dynamical model consists of two components and the total potential @xmath7 is given by the equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 the first part , eq .",
    "( [ vgal ] ) , is a generalization of the [ @xcite ] potential ( see also [ @xcite,@xcite ] ) . in eq .",
    "( [ vgal ] ) @xmath11 is the gravitation constant , @xmath12 is the mass of the galaxy , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 are parameters connected to the geometry of the galaxy .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 describes the deviation from the axial symmetry . in the case where @xmath15 and @xmath16 the model describes a disk galaxy with a disk halo . here , @xmath17 is the disk s scale - length , @xmath18 is the disk s scale - height and @xmath19 is the core radius of the disk halo . on the other hand , when @xmath20 and @xmath21 the model describes an elliptical galaxy with @xmath17 and @xmath18 being the horizontal and vertical scale - lengths respectively . the second part , eq .",
    "( [ vnuc ] ) , is the potential of a spherically symmetric nucleus in which @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the mass and the scale - length of the nucleus respectively .",
    "this potential has been used in the past to model the central mass component of a galaxy ( see , e.g. , [ @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ] ) . here",
    "we must point out , that potential ( [ vnuc ] ) is not intended to represent a black hole nor any other compact object , but a dense and massive nucleus therefore , we do nt include any relativistic effects .",
    "we made this choice for two basic reasons .",
    "the first reason is that the majority of galaxies are not exactly axially symmetric .",
    "the axial symmetry is only a good approximation , allowing us to perform the numerical calculations a lot easier .",
    "therefore , the new model is useful because it is more realistic .",
    "furthermore , this model can be use to describe a wide variety of galaxies .",
    "for instance ,",
    "when @xmath14 is close to unity it can describe a nearly axially symmetric galaxy , while for larger values of @xmath14 it describes systems that are far from axial symmetry .",
    "a second reason is that the regular or chaotic nature of orbits is drastically affected by the value of the parameter @xmath14 .",
    "thus , using this new model we can draw useful conclusions connecting the deviation from axial symmetry with the character of orbits in non axially symmetric galaxies .",
    "in this work , we use the well known system of galactic units , where the unit of length is 1 kpc , the unit of mass is @xmath24 and the unit of time is @xmath25 yr . the velocity units is 10 km / s , while @xmath11 is equal to unity .",
    "the energy unit ( per unit mass ) is 100 km@xmath26s@xmath27 . in these units",
    "the values of the involved parameters are : @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "for the disk model we choose @xmath31 and @xmath32 , while for the elliptical model we have set @xmath20 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the particular values of the system s parameters were chosen having in mind a milky way - type galaxy [ @xcite ] .",
    "the parameter describing the deviation from axially symmetry @xmath14 , on the other hand , is treated as a parameter and its value varies in the interval @xmath35 .    at this point , we must emphasize , the mass density in our new model ( [ vtot ] ) can be negative when the distance from the centre of the galaxy @xmath36 described by the model exceeds a minimum distance @xmath37 , which strongly depends on the parameter @xmath14 . fig .",
    "[ deneg](a - b ) shows a plot of @xmath37 vs @xmath14 for the both disk and elliptical galaxy models . in all cases ,",
    "we consider that the dimensions of our new model do not exceed @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the mass density is always positive inside the galaxy described by the model , while is zero elsewhere .",
    "being more precise , our gravitational potential is truncated at @xmath38 kpc for both reasons : ( i ) otherwise the total mass of the galaxy modeled by this potential would be infinite , which is obviously not physical and ( ii ) to avoid the existence of any negative density .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion are @xmath39 the evolution of a deviation vector @xmath40 , which joins the corresponding phase space points of two initially nearby orbits , needed for the computation of the standard indicators of chaos ( the sali in our case ) , can be monitored by the variational equations @xmath41    the hamiltonian which determines the motion of a test particle ( star ) in our system is @xmath42 where where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the momenta per unit mass conjugate to @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath0 respectively , while @xmath48 is the numerical value of the hamiltonian , which is conserved .",
    "when studying the orbital structure of a dynamical system , knowing whether an orbit is regular or chaotic is an issue of significant importance . over the years , several dynamical indicators have been developed in order to determine the nature of orbits . in our case , we chose to use the smaller alingment index ( sali ) method .",
    "the sali [ @xcite ] is undoubtedly a very fast , reliable and effective tool , which is defined as @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the alignments indices , while @xmath52 and @xmath53 , are two deviations vectors which initially point in two random directions . for distinguishing between ordered and chaotic motion , all we have to do is to compute the sali for a relatively short time interval of numerical integration @xmath54 .",
    "more precisely , we track simultaneously the time - evolution of the main orbit itself as well as the two deviation vectors @xmath52 and @xmath53 in order to compute the sali .",
    "the variational equations ( [ variac ] ) , as usual , are used for the evolution and computation of the deviation vectors .",
    "the time - evolution of sali strongly depends on the nature of the computed orbit since when the orbit is regular the sali exhibits small fluctuations around non zero values , while on the other hand , in the case of chaotic orbits the sali after a small transient period it tends exponentially to zero approaching the limit of the accuracy of the computer @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , the particular time - evolution of the sali allow us to distinguish fast and safely between regular and chaotic motion .",
    "nevertheless , we have to define a specific numerical threshold value for determining the transition from regularity to chaos . after conducting extensive numerical experiments , integrating many sets of orbits ,",
    "we conclude that a safe threshold value for the sali taking into account the total integration time of @xmath56 time units is the value @xmath57 . in order to decide whether an orbit is regular or chaotic",
    ", one may use the usual method according to which we check after a certain and predefined time interval of numerical integration , if the value of sali has become less than the established threshold value .",
    "therefore , if sali @xmath58 the orbit is chaotic , while if sali @xmath59 the orbit is regular . the time evolution of a regular ( r ) and a chaotic ( c ) orbit for a time period of @xmath56 time units is presented in fig . [ salievol ] .",
    "the horizontal , blue , dashed line in fig .",
    "[ salievol ] corresponds to that threshold value which separates regular from chaotic motion .",
    "therefore , the distinction between regular and chaotic motion is clear and beyond any doubt when using the sali method .",
    "time units .",
    "the horizontal , blue , dashed line corresponds to the threshold value @xmath57 which separates regular from chaotic motion .",
    "the chaotic orbits needs only about 120 time units in order to cross the threshold value , while on the other hand , the sticky orbit requires a vast integration time of about 8000 time units so as to reveal its chaotic nature . ]    in our study , each orbit was integrated numerically for a time interval of @xmath56 time units ( @xmath60 yr ) , which corresponds to a time span of the order of hundreds of orbital periods and about 100 hubble times .",
    "the particular choice of the total integration time is an element of great importance , especially in the case of the so called  sticky orbits \" ( i.e. , chaotic orbits that behave as regular ones during long periods of time ) .",
    "a characteristic example of a sticky orbit ( s ) in our galactic system can be seen in fig .",
    "[ salievol ] , where we observe that the chaotic character of the particular sticky orbit is revealed after a considerable long integration time of about 8000 time units . a sticky orbit",
    "could be easily misclassified as regular by any chaos indicator , if the total integration interval is too small , so that the orbit do not have enough time in order to reveal its true chaotic character .",
    "thus , all the sets of orbits of a given grid were integrated , as we already said , for @xmath56 time units , thus avoiding sticky orbits with a stickiness at least of the order of 100 hubble times .",
    "all the sticky orbits which do not show any signs of chaoticity for @xmath56 time units are counted as regular ones , since that vast sticky periods are completely out of scope of our research .",
    "for the study of our models , we need to define the sample of orbits whose properties ( chaos or regularity ) we will identify .",
    "the best method for this purpose , would have been to choose the sets of initial conditions of the orbits from a distribution function of the models .",
    "this , however , is not available so , we define , for each set of values of the parameters of the potential , a grid of initial conditions @xmath61 regularly distributed in the area allowed by the value of the energy . in each grid",
    "the step separation of the initial conditions along the @xmath46 and @xmath43 axis was controlled in such a way that always there are at least 25000 orbits . for each initial condition",
    ", we integrated the equations of motion ( [ eqmot ] ) as well as the variational equations ( [ variac ] ) using a double precision bulirsch - stoer fortran algorithm [ @xcite ] with a small time step of order of @xmath62 , which is sufficient enough for the desired accuracy of our computations ( i.e. our results practically do not change by halving the time step ) . in all cases , the energy integral ( eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) ) was conserved better than one part in @xmath63 , although for most orbits it was better than one part in @xmath64 .",
    "in this section , we shall present the results of our research .",
    "we start our presentation from the results obtained for the disk galaxy model , which are presented in subsection [ diskres ] .",
    "moreover , subsection [ ellipres ] is devoted to the results obtained for elliptical galaxy model .",
    "a simple qualitative way for distinguishing between regular and chaotic motion in a hamiltonian system is by plotting the successive intersections of the orbits using a poincar surface of section ( pss ) [ @xcite ] .",
    "this method has been extensively applied to 2d models , as in these systems the pss is a two - dimensional plane . in 3d systems , however , the pss is four - dimensional and thus the behavior of the orbits can not be easily visualized .",
    "one way to overcome this issue is to project the pss to phase spaces with lower dimensions , following the method used in [ @xcite,@xcite ] .",
    "let us start with initial conditions on a 4d grid of the pss .",
    "in this way , we are able to identify again regions of order and chaos , which may be visualized , if we restrict our investigation to a subspace of the whole 6d phase space .",
    "we consider orbits with initial conditions @xmath65 , @xmath66 , while the initial value of @xmath67 is always obtained from the energy integral ( [ ham ] ) . in particular , we define a value of @xmath68 , which is kept constant and then we calculate the sali of the 3d orbits with initial conditions @xmath61 , @xmath66 . thus , we are able to construct again a 2d plot depicting the @xmath69 plane but with an additional value of @xmath68 , since we deal with 3d motion .",
    "all the initial conditions of the 3d orbits lie inside the limiting curve defined by @xmath70    for the disk galaxy model we use the energy value @xmath71 , while for the elliptical galaxy model the energy level is equal to @xmath72 .",
    "we chose for both disk and elliptical galaxy models such energy values which correspond to @xmath73 kpc when @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the maximum possible value of the coordinate @xmath46 on the @xmath76 plane .      in fig .",
    "[ dpz1](a - d ) we present the final sali values obtained from the selected grids of initial conditions for four different values of @xmath14 when @xmath74 .",

    "each point is coloured according to its @xmath77 value at the end of the integration . in these sali plots ,",

    "[ dpz1]a shows the sali grid when @xmath78 .",
    "we observe a vast chaotic sea , which implies that the majority of the orbits are chaotic .",
    "however , we can identify several regions of regular motion .",
    "the two large islands on either side of the @xmath79 axis correspond to 2:1 resonant orbits , while the set of the two smaller islands confined to the outer parts of the grid contains initial conditions producing 1:1 resonant orbits .",

    "[ dpz1 ] , one may conclude , that for small values of the deviation parameter @xmath14 , our galactic model exhibits several types of resonant orbits , which are strongly affected by shifting the value of @xmath14 . furthermore , we should point out that as we increase the value of @xmath14 approaching to axial symmetry @xmath83 the amount of chaos decreases .",
    "similar results can be obtained from the grids shown in fig .",
    "[ doz1](a - d ) where @xmath84 .",
    "it is evident , that when @xmath85 the the 1:1 resonant orbits is the all - dominant type of regular 3d orbits . as the value of @xmath14 increases",

    "we proceed now , investigating how the deviation parameter @xmath14 influences 3d orbits with large values of @xmath68 .",
    "we choose @xmath86 as a fiducial value for our sets of initial conditions of orbits .",
    "[ dpz10](a - d ) shows the sali grids of initial conditions when @xmath87 . in fig .",

    "the ordered motion is confined mainly at the outer upper and lower parts of the grid . when @xmath80 we observe in fig .",
    "[ dpz10]b , that the percentage of the sticky orbits has been decreased drastically and therefore , the structure of the chaotic domain is much more solid and well defined .",
    "things however , become very interesting in fig .",
    "[ dpz10]c where @xmath81 . here , sticky orbits grow again in percentage and also two additional regions of regular motion emerge . in fig .",
    "[ dpz10]d where @xmath82 we observe , that the initial conditions corresponding to regular motion have inundated almost the entire grid , thus confining chaotic orbits to the right and left outer regions of the plane .",
    "it is worth noticing , that when @xmath86 the available area inside the @xmath76 plane is considerably less than that when @xmath74 .",
    "what actually happens is that by shifting to higher levels of @xmath68 , both the maximum possible value of the @xmath46 coordinate and the maximum possible value of the @xmath43 velocity on the @xmath76 plane are constantly reduced as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ theors]a where a plot of @xmath88 ( red color ) and @xmath89 ( green color ) versus @xmath68 is presented .",
    "moreover , for large values of @xmath68 we see that the outermost limiting curve tends to be circular , because the ratio @xmath90 tends asymptotically to unity with increasing @xmath68 ( see fig .",
    "[ theors]b ) .",
    "similar behavior applies in the case of the elliptical galaxy .",
    "thus , we could argue , that this fact justifies in a way , the swarming percentages of regular orbits ( see e.g. , fig . [",
    "dpz10]d ) .",
    "quite similar outcomes are obtained when @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "[ doz10]a shows the grid when @xmath91 , that is an almost axially symmetric model .",
    "as expected , the vast majority of the computed orbits are regular , while the small deviation from axially symmetry induces a low percentage of chaos , which is confined at the left and right regions of the grid . moreover , as the value of the deviation parameter @xmath14 increases , there is a constant increase of the portion of the initial conditions of chaotic orbits , which penetrates deeper and deeper toward the central region of the grid ( see , figs .",
    "[ doz10](b - d ) ) .    .",
    "green color corresponds to @xmath74 , while red color to @xmath86 . ]    thus , calculating from all the sali grids the percentage of chaotic orbits ( including also the sticky orbits , which if we integrate them using more time will eventually reveal their chaotic nature ) , we are able to follow how this fraction varies as a function of the deviation parameter @xmath14 . as it is clear from fig .",
    "[ disk_ch ] , the pattern of the evolution of the chaotic percentage is quite similar in both studied cases ( @xmath74 and @xmath86 ) . in particular , wee see , that the amount of chaos decreases sharply when @xmath92 , while this tendency is reversed when @xmath85 .",
    "for @xmath93 the chaotic percentage held always larger values when @xmath74 than when @xmath86 . clearly , the minimum value of the chaotic percentage is observed when the galactic model is axially symmetric @xmath83 .",
    "specifically , in the case where @xmath86 , the chaotic percentage tends asymptotically to zero when @xmath94 . on the contrary , chaos remains at high levels around 25% when @xmath74 , probably due to the greater influence of the massive nucleus .",
    "we now turn our investigation to the elliptical galaxy model .",
    "once more , we define sets of initial conditions and then we compute the sali of the 3d orbits in an attempt to construct grids thus distinguishing between regular and chaotic motion . in fig .",

    "initially , [ @xcite ] proposed a technique , dubbed spectral dynamics , for this particular purpose . later on , this method has been extended and improved by [ @xcite ] , while the extraction of basic frequencies was obtained with the frequency modified fourier transform which was refined by [ @xcite ] . in general terms",
    ", this method computes the fourier transform of the coordinates of an orbit , identifies its peaks , extracts the corresponding frequencies and search for the fundamental frequencies and their possible resonances .",
    "thus , we can easily identify the various families of regular orbits and also recognize the secondary resonances that bifurcate from them . in fig .",
    "[ clas](a - b ) we present two characteristic examples thus demonstrating the reconstruction of the orbital structure of the @xmath76 plane , which enable us now to distinguish not only between regular and chaotic motion but also between different families of regular orbits .",
    "[ clas]a depicts the case of an elliptical galaxy model with @xmath80 and @xmath74 , while in fig .",
    "[ clas]b we see a similar grid for a disk galaxy model with @xmath96 and @xmath86 . here",
    "we should point out , that these two grids are in fact advanced versions of the regular / chaotic sali grids given in fig .",
    "[ eoz1]c and fig .",
    "[ dpz10]b respectively .",
    "we shall close this section by presenting in fig .",
    "[ orbs](a - f ) several characteristic examples of 3d orbits that are encountered in our galaxy model .",
    "all orbits were computed until @xmath99 time units .",
    "the exact type ( resonance ) , the model used to produce each orbits and the initial conditions are given in table [ table ] .",
    "it is worth noticing that the 1:1 resonance is usually the hallmark of loop orbits , both coordinates oscillating with the same frequency in their main motion .",
    "previously , we have seen that in general terms , the dominant type of regular orbits is the 1:1 resonant orbits .",
    "our extensive numerical calculations indicate , that the 1:1 resonance in our model appears in three different forms , according to which axes the oscillations take place . in particular , we see in figs .",
    "[ orbs](a - c ) three different types of 1:1 resonant orbits . in fig .",
    "[ orbs]a we have the 1:1:0 resonance since the oscillations take place to the @xmath46 and @xmath47 axes . on the other hand , in fig .",
    "[ orbs]b we see a 1:0:1 resonant orbit oscillating at @xmath46 and @xmath0 axes , while in fig .",
    "[ orbs]c the oscillations take place at the @xmath47 and @xmath0 axis and therefore we have a 0:1:1 resonant 3d orbit .",
    "the first type , that is the 1:1:0 , is very common to both disk and elliptical galaxy models with low values of @xmath0 . in galaxy models with large values of @xmath68 (",
    "i.e. , @xmath86 ) the dominant resonance transforms to the other two types ( 1:0:1 and 0:1:1 ) .",
    "so , one may conclude , that orbits possessing low values of @xmath68 should circulate horizontally ( parallel with the galactic plane ) around the nucleus , while for 3d orbits having large values of @xmath68 we expect them to perform loop orbits perpendicularly to the galactic plane .",
    "astronomers built and use dynamical models in order to represent and therefore study the structure and the evolution of galaxies .",
    "the data needed for the construction of these models , consist mainly of images and spectra obtained using ground - based observations as well as the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "axially symmetric models for the central parts of galaxies , containing a central black hole ( bh ) were constructed by [ @xcite ] . in their paper , the authors combined ground based data from the michigan - dartmouth - mit ( mdm ) observatory with similar input from hst . in particular , the technique of numerical orbit superposition was applied , in order to built galactic models with distribution functions with three isolating integrals of motion .",
    "then , the mass of the central bh , the mass to light ratio and also the orbital structure of the system could be obtained from those models .",
    "moreover , axially symmetric models , for oblate elliptical galaxies , with a distribution function depending on two integrals of motion were constructed by [ @xcite ] . in their work , the authors used high quality data from the hst . using the models",
    ", they managed to obtain the dynamical mass to light ratio @xmath100 and the corresponding rotation rate of each galaxy .",
    "they also found that the brightest galaxies rotate too slow to account for their flattening .    from all the above ,",
    "it becomes clear that nearly axially symmetric , triaxial and asymmetric galaxies can not be represented by axially symmetric models .",
    "therefore , it seems necessary to construct a new dynamical model in order to be able to describe the properties of motion in non axially symmetric galaxies .    in this paper , we have presented a new dynamical mass model for non axially symmetric galaxies .",
    "the model consists of two parts .",
    "the first part represents the main body of the galaxy , while the second part represents a massive and dense central nucleus .",
    "we made this choice for a number of reasons .",
    "a first reason is that in most galaxies , the axial symmetry is just an approximation in order to make the mathematical study of galaxies more convenient . on the other hand",
    ", there is no doubt that there are galaxies that are close to axial symmetry , as well as galaxies that are not axially symmetric .",
    "since our model covers a large variety of types of galaxies , the model could be considered more realistic . for a second reason",
    ", we can argue the following : as there is evidence that most galaxies host massive objects [ @xcite ] , in their centres , we constructed a model with a spherical massive nucleus . we believe that with this additional massive nucleus , we describe more precisely a real galaxy .",
    "a third reason is that the dense and massive nucleus plays a vital role on the nature of motion , that is the regular or chaotic character of orbits ( see [ @xcite,@xcite ] and references therein ) .",
    "an additional advantage of the new dynamical model is that it can describe motion in disk as well as in elliptical galaxies .",
    "this is obtained by suitably choosing the values of the parameters @xmath101 , while the deviation from axial symmetry is regulated by the quantity @xmath14 . here",
    "we must make clear , that we consider that the dimensions of the new galaxy dynamical model are taken such as the mass density is always positive inside the galaxy and zero elsewhere ( see fig .",
    "[ deneg]a - b ) .",
    "we would also like to remind to the reader , that we have constructed this model in order to investigate the regular or chaotic nature of orbits and to try to connect it with the parameter @xmath14 . in order to obtain this",
    ", we used the sali method . using the same technique",
    ", we obtained interesting results on describing the different families of regular orbits that are present in the model .",
    "our results referring to the dynamical properties of the new galactic model can be summarized as follows :    * ( 1 ) . * taking into account that our dynamical model is three - dimensional ( 3d ) , we had to find a way to define the sample of orbits whose properties ( order or chaos ) would be examined .",
    "a very convenient technique , which is described in sec . [ numres ] , was used and thus , we were able to study 3d orbits with initial condition in @xmath76 plane with an additional value of @xmath68 .",
    "we then studied how the particular value of @xmath68 controls the amount of chaos in the system by choosing two different values of @xmath68 , leading to the conclusion that @xmath68 is a key element regarding the nature of orbits .    *",
    "* we conducted a thorough investigation in several cases , using different values of the parameter in the range @xmath102 .",
    "our numerical results , indicate that the parameter @xmath14 , which describes the deviation from axially symmetry is indeed very influential both in the disk and the elliptical galaxy models .    *",
    "( 3 ) . * when @xmath103 and @xmath74 we found that in both disk and elliptical galaxy models a lot of different types of resonances appear . on the other hand , in galaxy models with large values of @xmath68 , such as @xmath86 ,",
    "all the secondary resonances are suppressed and the 1:1 loop orbits is the dominant type .    *",
    "* in the case where @xmath85 the percentage of secondary resonances is extremely low and the 3d 1:1 loop orbits are abundant both in elliptical and disk galaxy models for all values of @xmath68 .",
    "however , the exact structure of these orbits differ significantly according to the value of @xmath68 .",
    "in fact , stars moving in 3d regular orbits with low values of @xmath68 circulate parallel to the galactic plane , while for large values of @xmath68 the 3d loop orbits are performed vertically to the galactic plane .    *",
    "* we found a very strong correlation between the value of the deviation parameter @xmath14 and the fraction of chaotic orbits both in disk and elliptical models . according to our numerical experiments",
    ", chaos turns out to be dominant in galaxy models with sufficient deviation from axial symmetry .",
    "moreover , the observed amount of chaos in the disk galaxy models is significantly larger than in elliptical models .",
