    "various results in the theory of singular integrals are known `` for all caldern  zygmund operators '' .",
    "examples that we have in mind include the @xmath0 theorem of david  journ @xcite : @xmath2 its extension to non - homogeneous ( non - doubling ) measures by nazarov  treil  volberg @xcite ; and the @xmath1 theorem of the second author @xcite : @xmath3_{a_2},\\quad [ w]_{a_2}:=\\sup_q\\fint_q w\\,dx\\fint_q\\frac{1}{w}dx.\\ ] ] however , when it comes to fine details of the definition of caldern  zygmund operators , it turns out that these theorems ( seem to ) require slightly different assumptions on the operator .",
    "we are particularly concerned about the minimal smoothness assumptions that one needs to impose on the kernel of the operator .    the most common definition of caldern  zygmund operators involves hlder - continuous ( in a suitable scale - invariant fashion , detailed below ) kernels , with a power - type modulus of continuity @xmath4 for @xmath5 $ ] , and",
    "it is in this form that both the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 theorems first appeared .",
    "however , in many cases one can deal with more general continuity - moduli with a modified dini - condition of the type @xmath6 the usual dini - condition corresponds to @xmath7 , and it is known to be enough for many classical results in the theory of singular integrals .",
    "it is only very recently that this was shown to be sufficient for the @xmath1 theorem as well , by lacey  @xcite , whereas the prior approaches needed @xmath8 ( this is explicit in @xcite and implicit in @xcite ) .",
    "the sharpest sufficient condition for the classical @xmath0 theorem , to our knowledge , appears to be @xmath9 , which is implicit in figiel @xcite and explicit in deng , yan and yang @xcite .",
    "however , the more recent extensions of the @xmath0 theorem to non - homogeneous measures are only available under the hlder - continuity assumption .",
    "( see @xcite for the full non - homogeneous @xmath10 theorem , or @xcite , where the special case of the @xmath0 theorem is recovered by methods that are closely related both to the @xmath1 theorem and the present paper . )",
    "given that the critical cancellation properties of caldern  zygmund operators are somewhat hidden in their usual definition , all results mentioned above depend crucially on ( implicit or explicit ) _ representation theorems _ of caldern  zygmund operators as infinite superpositions of simpler ( which often means : dyadic ) model operators , @xmath11 in this way , the smoothness needed to bound an operator is linked with the smoothness required to obtain a convergent representation .",
    "there are basically two kinds of representation theorems , linear and non - linear . in the linear case ,",
    "each @xmath12 is linear in both @xmath13 and @xmath14 , or , stated otherwise , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a linear transformation between suitable spaces of linear operators .",
    "such a representation lies behind the usual proofs of the @xmath0 theorem , as well as the original proof of the @xmath1 theorem @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , the more recent approaches to the @xmath1 theorem @xcite ( as well as some recent ramifications of the @xmath0 theorem @xcite ) are based on decompositions , where @xmath17 depends non - linearly on both @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "typically , such non - linear representations arise from some kind of stopping time arguments .",
    "although non - linear representations appear to yield stronger results , at least in questions around the @xmath1 theorem , there is still independent interest towards linear representations , which are better suited e.g. , for iterative applications as in @xcite , or multi - parameter extensions , as in @xcite .",
    "it is also of some theoretical interest whether the non - linear methods are fundamentally stronger , or whether the same results could also be recovered via linear representations .    in this paper , we prove a new ( linear )",
    "dyadic representation formula with applications to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 theorems . in the @xmath0 direction",
    ", this leads to a non - homogeneous @xmath0 theorem under the same mild kernel regularity assumptions that were so far only known in a homogeneous setting . as for @xmath1 , while we are not able to recover the largest class of kernels amenable to non - linear methods , we come rather close to it , and much closer than any of the previously known linear arguments .",
    "we now turn to a more detailed description of our results .",
    "let @xmath13 be a caldern - zygmund operator of order @xmath18 on @xmath19 , with respect to a borel measure @xmath20 of order @xmath18 .",
    "that is , @xmath13 acts on a dense subspace of functions in @xmath21 ( for the present purposes , this class should at least contain the indicators of cubes in @xmath19 ) and has the kernel representation @xmath22 where @xmath20 satisfies the growth condition @xmath23 for every @xmath24 and every @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath20 need not be a doubling measure .",
    "moreover , the kernel should satisfy the @xmath18th order standard estimates , which we assume in the following form : @xmath26 and @xmath27 whenever @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath29 is a modulus of continuity : an increasing and subadditive ( @xmath30 ) function with @xmath31 .",
    "we also assume the `` @xmath0 '' conditions in the local form @xmath32 for all cubes @xmath33 , where we also regard @xmath34 as a cube in the case that @xmath35 .",

    "both dyadic paraproducts and dyadic shifts mentioned in the theorem have the `` usual definition '' , which we shall recall below . as indicated , the dyadic operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 of the new representation theorem are not precisely dyadic shifts in the sense of the usual definition , although they are closely related to them .",
    "but , in a sense , these operators have a fundamental nature , and their norm bounds stated above are more efficient than what would follow from their decomposition into usual shifts and an application of known estimates .    the operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 are related to , and inspired by , certain operators denoted by @xmath47 and @xmath48 and introduced by figiel @xcite",

    "the proof of the theorem is then divided into the subsequent sections .",
    "we split the main part of the proof into _ identities _ and _ estimates _ , namely , writing @xmath13 as a sum of the dyadic pieces ( section [ s3 ] ) , and showing that these pieces satisfy the relevant norm bounds ( section [ sec : estimates ] ) .",

    "we choose the following set - up , similar to @xcite or @xcite , to carry out these manipulations :    let @xmath36 be both supported on some big cube @xmath130 , and constant on the dyadic subcubes of @xmath130 of side - length @xmath131",

    "( this determines the choice of dyadic cubes smaller than @xmath133 uniquely , but we can make an arbitrary choice of the dyadic ancestors of @xmath133 in the system @xmath61 . )",

    "thus @xmath136 and @xmath61 have the same small dyadic cubes , and since @xmath14 and @xmath128 are constant on these cubes , the corresponding martingale differences vanish .    similarly , we only randomise on length scales smaller than the support of the functions .",
    "in particular , no matter the value of @xmath69 , we find that @xmath137 contains the supports of @xmath14 and @xmath128 .",

    "thus , all our sums and expectations range over fixed finite ranges only , so that the rearrangement of the summation order is never an issue . since the terms @xmath141 and @xmath142 are trivial to handle by the @xmath0 conditions , we may also assume that these terms ( equivalently , the integrals @xmath143 and @xmath144 ) vanish , so that both @xmath14 and @xmath128 are expanded in terms of the martingale differences alone .",
    "with this reduction stated , however , we will no indicate it explicitly , but simply write @xmath145 , or just @xmath146 , for the relevant sum above .",
    "a cautious reader might notice that our fiddling with the definition of `` @xmath140 '' will have some impact on the properties of the notion of goodness discussed above .",
    "however , the changes are essentially immaterial , since goodness is really only relevant to us when both the smaller and the bigger cube appear in our martingale difference expansion , and for such cubes , our randomisation is essentially unchanged .",
    "we will leave the detailed verification of this `` no harm done '' assertion to the interested reader ; see also the discussion of `` good '' and `` really good '' cubes in @xcite .",
    "with the notation defined , we can provide additional detail to theorem  [ thm : newrepr ] as follows :    [ thm : details ] in the representation theorem  [ thm : newrepr ] , the various operators have the following form : @xmath147 where the operators @xmath148 and @xmath149 satisfy the orthogonality relations @xmath150 and their kernels @xmath151 and @xmath152 satisfy the bounds @xmath153 moreover , the paraproducts have the form @xmath154 where @xmath155    if @xmath20 is doubling , the following additional statements hold :    * the pointwise bound for @xmath156 is also valid for @xmath157 . * for each @xmath158 , we have @xmath159 .",
    "the proof of theorems  [ thm : newrepr ] and [ thm : details ] naturally splits into two parts : the algebraic identities that give the desired decomposition , and the estimates for the terms of this expansion .",

    "the following proposition is introduces goodness into the basic martingale difference expansion :    [ dyarepthm ] let @xmath13 be a caldern - zygmund operator , @xmath36 as in the finitary set - up of section  [ sec : finitary ] , and @xmath160 with @xmath122",
    ". then @xmath13 has the following expansion @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163    this result is similar to proposition 3.5 of @xcite which we are going to replicate here with our definition of goodness .",

    "@xmath331    from the previous lemma and the disjointness of @xmath293 , we have @xmath332 for a pair @xmath296 , there is at most one @xmath297 such that @xmath298 , and fixing this @xmath204 , there is at most one integer @xmath299 such that @xmath300 .",

    "note that this is already enough for the deduction of corollary  [ cor : t1 ] .",
    "a dyadic shift of type @xmath341 can be defined as an operator of the form @xmath342 where the operators @xmath343 satisfy the orthogonality property @xmath344 and their kernels @xmath345 have the pointwise bound @xmath346 since @xmath347 and @xmath348 , this is easily seen to coincide with the definition in terms of haar functions that is used in several papers .",
    "we concentrate on @xmath126 , since the case of negative @xmath99 is similar and essentially dual to this one .",
    "( note that the adjoint of a dyadic shift of type @xmath341 is a shift of type @xmath349 . ) then @xmath350 and the kernel @xmath289 of @xmath149 satisfies @xmath351 since @xmath352 is a difference of averaging operators ( or by the pointwise bounds for the haar functions ) , it follows that the kernel of @xmath353 satisfies the same bound .",

    "thus we need to reorganise the summation : @xmath372 using support considerations to see that only the terms with @xmath373 are non - zero , and simplifying @xmath374 .",
    "now , the right hand side has the structure of a shift of order @xmath369 , and we only need to verify the bound for the kernel .",
    "the kernel of @xmath375 is given by @xmath376 which is the correct bound . since @xmath377 is a difference of averaging operators ( or from the bounds for haar functions ) , we find that the kernel of @xmath378 has the same bound .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "now we have completed the proof of all claims in theorem  [ thm : newrepr ] , and therefore also the proof of corollary  [ cor : a2 ] .",

    "it follows that @xmath394 also , the set @xmath395 satisfies @xmath396 .",
    "so it remains to estimate @xmath397 we have @xmath398 and @xmath399 since @xmath301 must intersect both @xmath400 and @xmath401 to get a non - zero contribution .",
