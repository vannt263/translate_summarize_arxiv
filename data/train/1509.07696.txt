    "in high energy nucleus nucleus collisions , the produced particles are anisotropic in momentum space . the elliptic flow , @xmath7 , which is the second fourier coefficient of the azimuthal distribution of produced particles with respect to the reaction plane , is defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the azimuthal angle of produced particle and @xmath10 is the azimuthal angle of the reaction plane .",
    "it has been shown that elliptic flow is sensitive to the early stage of heavy - ion collisions and equation of state of the formed system  @xcite . however",
    ", early dynamic information might be obscured by later hadronic rescatterings  @xcite .",
    "multi - strange hadrons and the @xmath1 meson are believed to be less sensitive to hadronic rescatterings in the late stage of collisions , as their freeze - out temperatures are close to the phase transition temperature and their hadronic interaction cross sections are expected to be small  @xcite .",
    "previous measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath3 @xmath7 from star were limited by statistics  @xcite , thus the @xmath11 and centrality dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath3 @xmath7 are not clear .",
    "furthermore , with high precision measurements of @xmath1 meson @xmath0 , one can compare it with proton @xmath0 in the low @xmath11 region .",
    "it may provide information on the effect of hadronic rescatterings in the late stage of the collision .",
    "in these proceedings , @xmath0 measurements of multi - strange hadrons from the star experiment at @xmath2 = 200 gev au + au collisions are presented .",
    "about 730 million minimum bias events recorded by star in 2010 and 2011 were used in the analysis . the time projection chamber ( tpc )",
    "was used for centrality definition and event plane determination .",
    "the centrality was determined by the number of tracks from the pseudorapidity region @xmath12 . the particle identification ( pid )",
    "was achieved via energy loss in tpc and flight time in the time of flight ( tof ) .",
    "the multi - strange hadrons and the @xmath1 meson were reconstructed though the following decay channels : @xmath1 @xmath13 @xmath14 + @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xmath13 @xmath17 + @xmath18 ( @xmath19 @xmath13 @xmath20 + @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 @xmath13 @xmath17 + @xmath15 ( @xmath23@xmath13 @xmath20 + @xmath14 ) . the @xmath24 sub - event plane method is used for the @xmath0 measurement  @xcite . in this method , one defines the event flow vector for each particle based on particles measured in the opposite hemisphere in pseudorapidity .",
    "an @xmath24 gap of @xmath25 0.1 between positive and negative pseudorapidity sub - events is introduced to suppress non - flow effects .",
    "figure  [ figure1 ]  @xcite shows the elliptic flow @xmath7 as a function of transverse momentum @xmath26 at midrapidity ( @xmath27 ) for ( a ) @xmath16 + @xmath19 , ( b ) @xmath22 + @xmath23 and ( c ) @xmath1 in au + au collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev for 0 - 30@xmath28 and 30 - 80@xmath28 centrality .",
    "a clear centrality dependence of @xmath29 is observed for multi - strange hadrons and @xmath1 meson , which is similar to that of light and strange hadrons previously measured by the rhic experiments  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 values are larger in peripheral collisions ( 30 - 80@xmath28 centrality ) than those in central collisions ( 0 - 30@xmath28 centrality ) .",
    "this is consistent with an interpretation in which the anisotropy in final momentum space is driven by the anisotropy in initial position space .",
    "figure  [ figure2 ]  @xcite shows the @xmath7 as a function of @xmath26 for @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( panel ( a ) ) and @xmath1 , @xmath3 ( panel ( b ) ) in au + au collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev for 0 - 80@xmath28 centrality .",
    "a comparison between @xmath7 of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , consisting of up ( @xmath32 ) and down ( @xmath33 ) light constituent quarks is shown in panel ( a ) .",
    "correspondingly , panel ( b ) shows a comparison of @xmath7 of @xmath1 and @xmath3 containing @xmath34 constituent quarks .",
    "this is the first measurement of @xmath3 baryon @xmath0 up to 4.5 gev/@xmath35 with high precision . in the low @xmath26 region ( @xmath26@xmath362.0 gev/@xmath35 )",
    ", the @xmath7 of @xmath1 and @xmath3 follows mass ordering . at intermediate @xmath26 ( 2.0@xmath36@xmath26@xmath365.0 gev/@xmath35 ) ,",
    "a baryon - meson separation is observed .",
    "it is evident that the @xmath37 of hadrons consisting only of strange constituent quarks ( @xmath1 and @xmath3 ) is similar to that of light hadrons , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "however the @xmath1 and @xmath3 do not participate strongly in the hadronic interactions , because of the smaller hadronic cross sections compared to @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "it suggests that most of the collectivity is developed during the partonic phase in au + au collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev .",
    "hydrodynamical model calculations predict that @xmath7 as a function of @xmath26 for different particle species follows mass ordering , where the @xmath7 of heavier hadrons is lower than that of lighter hadrons  @xcite .",
    "the identified hadron @xmath7 measured in experiment indeed proves the mass ordering in the low @xmath26 region ( @xmath26@xmath361.5 gev/@xmath35 )  @xcite .",
    "recently , hirano _ et al . _",
    "predict the mass ordering of @xmath7 could be broken between @xmath1 mesons and protons at low @xmath38 ( @xmath26@xmath361.5 gev/@xmath35 ) based on a model with ideal hydrodynamics plus hadron cascade process  @xcite .",
    "as the model calculations assign a smaller hadronic cross section for @xmath1 mesons compared to protons , the broken mass ordering is regarded as the different hadronic rescattering contributions on the @xmath1 meson and proton @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ figure3 ]  @xcite shows the ratios of @xmath1 @xmath7 to proton @xmath7 from model calculations and experimental data .",
    "this ratio is larger than unity at @xmath26 @xmath39 0.5 gev/@xmath35 for 0 - 30@xmath28 centrality .",
    "it indicates breakdown of the expected mass ordering in that momentum range .",
    "this could be due to a large effect of hadronic rescattering on the proton @xmath7 , which qualitatively agrees with hydro + hadron cascade calculations indicated by the shaded red band in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] . a centrality dependence of @xmath40 to @xmath41 ratio is observed in the experimental data .",
    "namely , the breakdown of mass ordering of @xmath7 is more pronounced in 0 - 30@xmath28 central collisions than in 30 - 80@xmath28 peripheral collisions . in the central events ,",
    "both hadronic and partonic interactions are stronger than in peripheral events .",
    "therefore , the larger effect of late stage hadronic interactions relative to the partonic collectivity produces a greater breakdown of mass ordering in the 0 - 30@xmath28 centrality data than in the 30 - 80@xmath28 .",
    "this observation indirectly supports the idea that the @xmath1 meson has a smaller hadronic interaction cross section .",
    "the ratio of @xmath1 @xmath7 to proton @xmath7 was also studied by using the transport models ampt  @xcite and urqmd  @xcite .",
    "the panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] shows the @xmath40 to @xmath41 ratio for 0 - 30@xmath28 centrality from ampt and urqmd models .",
    "the black shaded band is from ampt with a hadronic cascade time of 0.6 fm/@xmath35 while the yellow band is for a hadronic cascade time of 30 fm/@xmath35 .",
    "larger hadronic cascade time is equivalent to stronger hadronic interactions .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath42 ratio increases with increasing hadronic cascade time .",
    "this is attributed to a decrease in the proton @xmath7 due to an increase in hadronic re - scattering while the @xmath1 meson @xmath7 is less affected .",
    "the ratios from the urqmd model are much smaller than unity ( shown as a blue shaded band in the panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) .",
    "the urqmd model lacks partonic collectivity , thus the @xmath1 meson @xmath7 is not fully developed .",
    "in summary , high - statistics elliptic flow measurements for multi - strange hadrons ( @xmath43 and @xmath3 ) and @xmath1 meson as a function of centrality and @xmath11 were reported in au + au collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev .",
    "the @xmath26 dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath3 @xmath7 is observed to be similar to that of light hadrons , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , indicating that most of the collectivity is developed in the initial partonic phase for light and strange hadrons .",
    "the comparison between the @xmath1 and @xmath31 @xmath7 at low @xmath26 shows that there is a possible violation of hydro - inspired mass ordering between @xmath1 and @xmath31 .",
    "model calculations suggest that the @xmath26 dependence of @xmath40 to @xmath41 ratios can be qualitatively explained by the different effects of late - stage hadronic interactions on the @xmath1 and proton @xmath7 .",
