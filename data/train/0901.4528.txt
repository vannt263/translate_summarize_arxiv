    "the first theory of classical collective electron density oscillations in ionized gases by tonks and langmuir@xmath0@xcite in the 1920 s helped initiate the field of plasma physics .",
    "the theory of collective electron density oscillations in metals , quantum in this case because of higher electron densities , was developed by bohm and pines@xmath0@xcite in the 1950 s and stands as a similarly pioneering contribution to many - electron physics .",
    "bohm and pines coined the term _ plasmon _ to describe quantized density oscillations . today _",
    "plasmonics _ is a very active subfield of optoelectronics@xmath0@xcite , whose aim is to exploit plasmon properties in order to compress infrared electromagnetic waves to the nanometer scale of modern electronic devices .",
    "this wide importance of plasmons across different fields of basic and applied physics follows from the ubiquity of charged particles and from the strength of the long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "the physical origin of plasmons is very simple .",
    "when electrons in a plasma move to screen a charge inhomogeneity , they tend to overshoot the mark . they are then pulled back toward the charge disturbance and overshoot again , setting up a weakly damped oscillation .",
    "the restoring force responsible for the oscillation is the average self - consistent field created by all the electrons . because of the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction , the frequency of oscillations @xmath1 tends to be high and is given in the long wavelength limit by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the electron density , @xmath4 is the bare electron mass in vacuum , and @xmath5 is the fourier transform of the coulomb interaction .",
    "this simple explicit plasmon energy expression is exact because long - wavelength plasmons involve rigid motion of the entire plasma which is independent of the complex exchange and correlation effects that dress@xmath0@xcite the motion of an individual electron . the exact plasmon frequency expression is correctly captured by the celebrated rpa@xmath0@xcite , but also by rigorous arguments@xmath0@xcite in which the selection of a particular center - of - mass position breaks the system s galilean invariance and plasmon excitations play the role of goldstone bosons . in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems",
    "@xmath6 so that @xmath7 .",
    "electrons in a solid , unlike electrons in a plasma or electrons with a _",
    "jellium model_@xmath0@xcite background , experience a periodic external potential created by the ions which breaks translational invariance and hence also galilean invariance .",
    "solid state effects can lead in general to a renormalization of the plasmon frequency , or even to the absence of sharp plasmonic excitations . in semiconductors and semimetals ,",
    "however , electron waves can be described at super - atomic length scales using @xmath8 theory@xmath0@xcite , which is based on an expansion of the crystal s bloch hamiltonian around band extrema . in the simplest case , for example for the conduction band of common cubic semiconductors ,",
    "this device leads us back to a galileian - invariant parabolic band continuum model with isolated electron energy @xmath9 .",
    "the crystal background for electron waves appears only via the replacement of the bare electron mass by an effective band mass @xmath10 .",
    "it is this type of @xmath8 galilean invariant interacting electron model , valid for many semiconductor and semiconductor heterojunction systems , which has been of greatest interest in solids .",
    "the absence of electron - electron interaction corrections to plasmon frequencies at very long wavelengths in these systems has been amply demonstrated experimentally by means of inelastic light scattering@xmath0@xcite .",
    "the situation turns out to be quite different in graphene  a monolayer of carbon atoms tightly packed in a 2d honeycomb lattice@xmath0@xcite , which has engendered a great deal of interest because of the new physics it exhibits and because of its potential as a new material for electronic technology .",
    "the agent responsible for many of the interesting electronic properties of graphene sheets is the bipartite nature of its honeycomb lattice .",
    "the two inequivalent sites in the unit cell of this lattice are analogous to the two spin orientations of a spin-@xmath11 particle along the @xmath12 and @xmath13 directions ( the @xmath14 axis being perpendicular to the graphene plane ) .",
    "this observation opens the way to an elegant description of electrons in graphene as particles endowed with a _",
    "degree - of - freedom@xmath0@xcite ( in addition to the regular spin degree - of - freedom which plays a passive role here ) .",
    "when @xmath8 theory is applied to graphene it leads to a new type of electron fluid model , one with separate dirac - weyl hamiltonians for electron waves centered in momentum space on one of two honeycomb lattice brillouin - zone corners : @xmath15 .",
    "here @xmath16 is the bare electron velocity , @xmath17 is the @xmath8 momentum , and @xmath18 is the pseudospin operator constructed with two pauli matrices @xmath19 , which act on the sublattice pseudospin degree - of - freedom .",
    "it follows that the energy eigenstates for a given @xmath17 have pseudospins oriented either parallel ( upper band ) or antiparallel ( lower band ) to @xmath17 .",
    "physically , the orientation of the pseudospin determines the relative amplitude and the relative phase of electron waves on the two distinct graphene sublattices .",
    "the feature of graphene that is ultimately responsible for the large many - body effects on the plasmon dispersion and the drude weight is _ broken galilean invariance_. what happens is that the oriented pseudospins provide an  ether \" against which a global boost of the momenta becomes detectable .",
    "this is explained in detail in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] .       in the present theory interactions affect the value of @xmath20 in two competing ways .",
    "( i ) the exchange field enhances @xmath21 relative to @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , thus enhancing the total pseudospin response . from what we have said above",
    "it follows that this effect gives a negative contribution to @xmath20 .",
    "( ii ) the exchange contribution @xmath24 to the equilibrium pseudomagnetic field increases@xmath0@xcite the conduction valence band splitting , thus suppressing the total pseudospin response . from the previous discussion it follows that this effect gives a positive contribution to @xmath20 .",
    "our calculations indicate that effect ( i ) dominates , resulting in a net reduction of the value of @xmath20 . physically , the enhancement of the total pseudospin response ( and thus the reduction of @xmath20 ) is a consequence of the gain in exchange energy that occurs when pseudospins in the same band tilt together towards a common direction .",
    "we believe that the effect discussed in this article will be observable in experiments of the kind discussed in refs.@xmath0@xcite .",
    "finally let us comment on the broader implications of our results .",
    "effects similar to those described in this article are also expected in graphene bilayers and other few - layer systems .",
    "the lack of galilean invariance should also affect the cyclotron resonance frequency and oscillator strength when the 2d sheet of graphene is placed in a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "undoubtedly much interesting physics , potentially useful for applications in optoelectronics , has still to be learned from the study of graphene and other non - galilean invariant systems .",
