    "each pair forms a kramers doublet related by time - reversal symmetry , with a symmetry - protected crossing at one of the two time - reversal invariant points in the brillouin zone .",
    "a single pair of edge states is therefore stable with respect to disorder and weak interactions .",
    "the ( nearly ) quantized spin hall conductivity can be used to detect the topological state in experiments @xcite .",
    "the interplay of a topological band structure and electronic correlations has emerged as a very fruitful and active field of research . for a sufficiently strong electron - electron repulsion , quantum spin hall insulators can undergo a mott transition to a topologically trivial antiferromagnet without edge states @xcite .",
    "quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite of the kane - mele - hubbard model have confirmed the expected 3d xy universality class of this transition , which remains unchanged even for a long - range coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "correlation effects have been studied in great detail also for other models  @xcite .    because the bulk of a quantum spin hall insulator is gapped , the edge states are exponentially localized at the edge . at sufficiently low energies ,",
    "they may therefore be considered to be one - dimensional .",
    "consequently , the effect of electron - electron interactions can not be captured using perturbation theory or mean - field methods . instead",
    ", a faithful description of correlated helical edge states is based on the bosonization method @xcite .",
    "a remarkable theoretical prediction is the occurrence of an edge - mott transition as a result of strong electron - electron repulsion @xcite .",
    "such a transition requires half - filled edge states and a rashba spin - orbit term to allow umklapp scattering @xcite . whereas the first condition is rather special , the second is generic for experimental realizations . above a critical interaction ( the critical point corresponds to a luttinger parameter @xmath1 )",
    ", umklapp scattering is a relevant perturbation , and the edge is expected to exhibit ising long - range magnetic order and an excitation gap at @xmath2 @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "time - reversal symmetry is broken only at the edge while the bulk remains topological , leading to a breakdown of the bulk - boundary correspondence @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the bulk mott transition , the edge - mott transition has not been demonstrated numerically . in particular , the rashba term gives rise to a sign problem that makes quantum monte carlo simulations challenging .",
    "previous work on models without rashba coupling ( and hence no mott transition ) revealed a strong suppression ( enhancement ) of the charge ( spin ) fluctuations and of the spectral weight at the fermi level suggestive of a mott transition @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that correlation effects are generically stronger at the edges than in the bulk @xcite , and that the condition @xmath3 for an edge mott state seems to be fulfilled in large regions of the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "correlated edge states were also simulated numerically with quantum cluster methods @xcite , but the latter do not capture the characteristic luttinger liquid physics . for future experiments , it is interesting to consider how different the signatures of the mott transition are from generic interaction effects .    here , we simulate a kane - mele - hubbard model using a quantum carlo ( qmc ) method .",
    "because interactions are only taken into account at the edge , the sign problem caused by the rashba term is not prohibitive . by comparing spin correlation functions and single - particle spectral functions",
    "we conclude that for accessible system sizes the differences due to rashba coupling are much more subtle than expected .",
    "the main reason for the absence of striking signatures of this transition is that correlation effects strongly modify the helical edge states even in the absence of a mott transition .",

    "the hamiltonian of the underlying kane - mele model is @xcite @xmath4 where we have used the spinor notation @xmath5 and the pauli vector @xmath6 .",
    "hamiltonian  ( [ eq : km ] ) consists of the usual tight - binding hopping term familiar from graphene ( @xmath7 ) @xcite , the @xmath8-conserving spin - orbit term first derived by kane and mele ( @xmath9 ) @xcite , and a rashba term ( @xmath10 ) @xcite .",

    "hamiltonian  ( [ eq : km ] ) describes a semimetal with a linear spectrum at the dirac points and a vanishing density of states at the fermi level @xcite .",

    "the rashba term does not conserve spin [ reducing the spin symmetry from @xmath22 to @xmath0 ] , and competes with the @xmath24 term .",
    "the quantum spin hall state remains stable up to @xmath25 @xcite .",

    "importantly , the quantum spin hall state at @xmath29 is adiabatically connected to the @xmath30 state @xcite , and bulk interactions are of minor importance in this gapped phase . while an additional rashba term competes with the topological band gap induced by the spin - orbit term , recent cluster calculations suggest that the critical @xmath31 for the bulk mott transition is only weakly affected @xcite .    to compare with theoretical predictions , it is necessary to consider sufficiently large ribbons at low temperatures .",
    "the ribbon width @xmath32 ( the extent perpendicular to the edge ) has to be large enough to avoid a hybridization of opposite edges @xcite . the length @xmath33 determines the momentum resolution and the maximal length scale for correlations . to compare to the bosonization results , we want to avoid any approximations that break symmetries or neglect fluctuations .",
    "qmc simulations of the full kane - mele - hubbard model can not take into account a rashba term due to a sign problem @xcite .",
    "therefore , we make use of the previously introduced idea @xcite of considering electronic interactions only at the edge , an approximation that is well justified by the absence of low - energy bulk excitations and the exponential localization of the edge states .",
    "this simplification allows us to simulate correlated edge states with rashba coupling on reasonably large lattices .",
    "the rashba term gives rise to a sign problem .",

    "such a slow decay is difficult to distinguish from mean - field order . put differently , the order parameter fluctuations that destroy the magnetic order for @xmath116 and @xmath2 or for @xmath3 and @xmath117 involve length scales that are not fully captured by the accessible system sizes .",
    "hence , whereas numerical work has successfully linked mott transitions in other one- and two - dimensional models to theoretical predictions , the mott transition of a helical luttinger liquid appears to be out of reach for existing numerical methods .    while the requirement of half - filling at first",
    "suggests that the mott transition is not particularly relevant for experiments , our results reveal that correlated helical edge states exhibit many of the characteristics of finite - temperature mott states ( pronounced spin correlations , suppressed spectral weight at the fermi level ) even when a mott transition is not allowed ."

    "<S> we study strongly correlated helical liquids with and without rashba coupling using quantum monte carlo simulations of the kane - mele model with a hubbard interaction at the edge . </S>",
    "<S> independent of the rashba coupling , we find that interactions enhance spin correlations and suppress the spectral weight at the fermi level . for sufficiently strong interactions </S>",
    "<S> , a gap can be observed in the single - particle spectral function . </S>",
    "<S> however , based on a finite - size scaling analysis and theoretical arguments , we argue that this gap is closed by order parameter fluctuations in the luttinger liquid phase even at zero temperature , and filled in by thermally induced kinks in the order parameter in the mott phase at finite temperatures . while the bosonization suggests an umklapp - driven mott transition only in the presence of rashba coupling and hence a significant impact of the latter , our numerical results are almost unaffected by rashba coupling even at low temperatures . </S>"
