    "at low temperature , disordered systems may be trapped in long - lived metastable states separated by large energy barriers that make relaxation to thermal equilibrium unlikely on experimental time scales . as a consequence , these systems , when driven by an external force , display a jerky and hysteretic behavior which is associated to irreversible jumps between the metastable states , events that are called _",

    "@xmath33 is the fraction of spins in a given configuration that are not aligned with their local field ( metastable states thus correspond to @xmath40 ) .    in the following ,",
    "the two quantities that describe macroscopically a disorder realization are @xmath41 , the number of states at field @xmath10 with magnetization @xmath42 and misalignment @xmath33 , and @xmath43 , the number of metastable states with magnetization @xmath9 .",

    "this is the general scenario that we try to confirm numerically in the present work .",
    "since numerical simulations are performed in finite systems , one must define the corresponding @xmath14-dependent complexities in such a way that one can properly extrapolate the results to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is quite natural to define the annealed complexity in finite systems as @xmath61 so that the average number of metastable states is just @xmath62 $ ] . a similar definition for",
    "the quenched complexity would be @xmath63 .",
    "this is not convenient , however , because the average of the logarithm diverges as soon as @xmath64 is zero in some sample , a situation that always occurs in a system of small size .",
    "one could imagine to circumvent the problem by arbitrarily setting @xmath65 in this case ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "this should be unimportant in the thermodynamic limit since it concerns a number of states that is nonexponential in system size .",
    "however , we recall that we are especially interested in the region where the quenched complexity is very small and vanishes when @xmath48",

    "therefore , the two curves obtained by plotting @xmath94 as a function of @xmath10 define the two branches of the average hysteresis loop . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical ( i.e. the most likely ) value of the magnetization of the metastables states is described by the curve @xmath95 which corresponds to the locus of the maximum of @xmath86 .",

    "the size - dependent quenched complexity also splits into two parts , @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "it is again useful to consider the magnetization and the complexity @xmath101 or @xmath102 as functions of the independent parameter @xmath71 through the relations @xmath103 or @xmath104 .",
    "of course , one recovers the preceding formulas with only one function @xmath85 or @xmath86 if @xmath105 .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the limits @xmath106 .",
    "now @xmath107 and @xmath108 correspond to the lower and upper branches of the hysteresis loop , respectively . on the other hand , in eqs .",
    "( [ complex.eq.5 ] ) , the limit @xmath92 ( resp .",

    "we now detail the numerical methods that we have used to compute the number of metastable states as a function of the magnetization and the external field .",
    "the simplest method for counting the number of metastable states in a given disorder realization consists in generating all the spin configurations and selecting those which are metastable in a certain range of the field . to do this",

    "an avalanche ( for instance on the ascending branch ) occurs between the extremal state @xmath123 at @xmath9 and the extremal state @xmath131 at @xmath132 when all the stable states with intermediate magnetization @xmath133 have a @xmath122 which is smaller than @xmath134 .",

    "[ fig1](d ) ) . at low disorder ( fig .  [ fig1](c ) ) , there exists a significant region inside the loop where there are no metastable states at all .",
    "this suggests that the discontinuity in the hysteresis loop in the thermodynamic limit is related to the existence of a region inside the loop without any typical metastable states .      the second method that we have used to compute the number of metastable states is the entropic sampling monte carlo ( mc ) algorithm@xcite , which is a variant of the multicanonical approach@xcite .",

    "one then obtains a histogram @xmath144 of the frequency of the macrostates and @xmath140 is updated according to the rule @xmath145    in principle , this method could yield the actual @xmath41 after a single very long mc run , even if the initial guess is very crude ( choosing @xmath146 implies that the states are first sampled at random since all spin flips are accepted ) .",
    "the problem with this brute - force procedure , however , is that the number of mc steps required to detect the macrostates that are exponentially less degenerate than the other ones increases exponentially with @xmath14 . in consequence",
    ", it is better to update @xmath41 iteratively so to disfavor the most degenerate macrostates and facilitate the search of those which are less degenerate .",
    "we have followed the strategy proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite which consists in starting with short mc stages and increasing the length of the subsequent stages if the number of visited states decreases . in this way ,",
    "the number of visited states increases and eventually saturates after a certain number of iterations @xmath147 that mainly depends on the system size and the length of the mc stages .",
    "saturation indicates that all the existing macrostates have been already visited ( and the corresponding histogram is flat ) .",
    "in this situation , the number @xmath148 corresponding to non - visited states is set to @xmath23 ( instead of the initial guess @xmath149 ) and one finally obtains @xmath41 from @xmath150 via the rescaling @xmath151 which ensures that the sum @xmath152 is equal to @xmath127 .",
