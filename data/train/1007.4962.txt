    "the assembly history of spiral galaxies remains one of the most pressing questions in astrophysics today ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , we do not have a clear picture of the formation mechanism for the central bulges of spiral galaxies . in the early universe ,",
    "galactic evolution was primarily driven by violent merging and dissipative collapse .",
    "mergers are accompanied by dissipation and star formation and are believed to make classical bulges and elliptical galaxies .",
    "are bulges of spirals simply `` small ellipticals '' , having formed through vigorous star formation through short time scale dissipative processes or merging during the early universe , with disks assembled later on ? or is bulge formation through secular evolution of inner disk stars a more common mechanism ?",
    "secular evolution is a slow process and involves the redistribution of disk material . in this scenario ,",
    "material is driven into the galaxy center by means of a bar instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or a minor interaction with a small satellite galaxy ( up to 10@xmath0 of the main galaxy mass ; see @xcite ) , triggering low - level star formation . as a result , galaxies would evolve from late - types to early - types with the growth of their bulges .",
    "a relatively new and powerful way to probe these fundamental questions is the study of the spheroids and their associated globular cluster ( gc ) systems in early - type spiral galaxies .    in `` normal '' elliptical galaxies , previous _ hst _ studies",
    "have shown that the broad - band color distribution of the gc systems are more consistent with two subpopulations of star clusters . under the assumption that the globular clusters in these systems have ages greater than a few gyrs , this color difference indicates the presence of two gc populations of different metallicities : blue ( metal - poor ) and red ( metal - rich ) clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the specific frequency of gcs ( @xmath1 , the total number of gcs per unit galaxy luminosity ) in `` normal '' ellipticals is high , typically in the range 1.54 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the spatial distribution and colors of massive metal - rich ( red ) gcs closely follow that of the spheroidal light ( i.e. , the `` bulge '' ) , whereas the metal - poor ( blue ) gc system is usually more extended (  halo - like  , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is generally interpreted as strong evidence that the formation of elliptical galaxies involved the formation of large numbers of such massive metal - rich gcs , and hence that star formation occurred in a vigorous and rapid manner ( `` dissipative collapse '' ) .    if the bulges of spirals formed in a manner similar to that in ellipticals , we expect galaxies with larger bulge - to - total luminosity ratios to be associated with a larger number of clusters . at face value , these results seem consistent with a relatively simple picture in which gc systems of spirals are made up of a `` universal '' halo population of metal - poor gcs that is present in each galaxy , plus a metal - rich bulge population which grows with the bulge mass or luminosity . on the other hand , in the `` secular evolution '' scenario , galaxies would evolve from late - types to early - types with the growth of their bulges , but the properties of their gc systems would remain largely unchanged because low star formation rates do not allow for the formation of star clusters that are massive enough to survive a hubble time ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "studies of gc systems in spirals with hubble types of sb and later @xcite and nearby face - on spirals @xcite showed that they have @xmath1 values of @xmath2 , i.e. much lower than in ellipticals , whereas earlier - type spirals typically have higher @xmath1 values ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . this scenario would indicate that spiral bulges are like small ellipticals having formed early on through rapid dissipative collapse and now residing at the center of a large disk which was mostly assembled later .",
    "based on properties of gc systems in the milky way , m31 , and m104 , @xcite suggested that red , metal - rich gcs in spirals are associated with bulges , and are the direct analogs of the red gcs seen in ellipticals .",
    "if this association can be verified and established , this would provide an important causal link between the formation of metal - rich gcs and that of spheroidal systems ( i.e. , bulges and ellipticals ) .",
    "thus , a thorough study of gc systems in spirals can provide important new clues regarding the formation of bulges / spheroids in spiral galaxies .    in the simple picture described above",
    ", the unambiguous detection of a relationship between bulge luminosity / mass and the specific frequency of gcs is highly dependent on the results for bulge - dominated spirals ( i.e. , sa galaxies ) but studies of gc systems of sa galaxies are still rather sparse . in this paper , we test the two basic scenarios for the formation of bulges in sa galaxies : ( 1 ) vigorous star ( and cluster ) formation through rapid dissipative processes which could be triggered by merging and ( 2 ) the slow secular evolution accompanied by low levels of star formation .",
    "we present the results of a new study of the gc systems of four edge - on , bulge - dominated ( early - type ) spiral galaxies .",
    "we focus on the gc color distributions and the relations between the gc specific frequency @xmath1 and host galaxy luminosity as well as the bulge - to - total luminosity ratio .",
    "as part of _ hst _ program go-10594 ( pi : goudfrooij ) we selected four nearby , edge - on , bulge - dominated spiral galaxies to study their gc systems .",
    "these galaxies all have the same morphological type ( sa ) , and they span a factor of @xmath3 in luminosity .",
    "the basic properties of our target galaxies , including their distance and absolute magnitude in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands are given in table  1 .",
    "observations were made using the wide field channel ( wfc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ in the f475w and f814w filters .",
    "the wfc has a 202  @xmath6 202  field of view with a plate scale of 0.05 per pixel .",
    "we chose these filters as the best compromise between high sensitivity and long color baseline .",
    "total exposure times ranged from 1164 sec to 3820 sec in f475w and from 1000 sec to 2320 sec in f814w . the flatfielded images produced by the _ hst _",

    "first , we removed the strong and varying galaxy light by applying a circular median filter of radius 15 pixels and dividing the image in each filter by the square root of this median image thus providing uniform shot noise characteristics over the whole frame .",
    "object finding was done on the square root divided images in each filter .",
    "we detected sources in our images using the daofind task in iraf using a detection threshold of 4@xmath7 above the background .",
    "next , we selected candidate gcs from the source lists by separating them from foreground stars and background galaxies based on their colors and morphology .",

    "we perform artificial cluster experiments to determine the completeness of our samples , by randomly distributing synthetic point sources with magnitudes between 22.0 and 28.0 over five distinct background levels in the @xmath12-band image for each galaxy .",
    "batches of 100 sources each were added and recovered from each image in brightness intervals of 0.25 mag .",

    "we use the _ hst _ images to determine the ratio of bulge to total luminosity ( @xmath14 ) for each galaxy .",
    "bulge parameters were derived for each galaxy using the @xmath12-band image and the bulge / disk decomposition method described in @xcite with one exception : rather than fitting an exponential profile ( representing a disk ) plus a @xcite @xmath15 profile ( representing a bulge ) to the observed minor - axis profile of the galaxies , we fit an exponential profile plus a @xcite profile @xmath16\\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the srsic effective radius along the minor axis , @xmath18 is a scale factor , @xmath19 is the intensity at @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the srsic parameter indicating the slope of the bulge profile .",
    "the fit was done by means of an iterative non - linear minimization routine after making initial estimates of the fit parameters using bootstrap tests .",
    "areas where dust extinction is apparent in the image were flagged and ignored during the fitting process .",
    "minor - axis @xmath17 values were converted to bulge effective radii @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ellipticity of the bulge as derived from ellipse fits to the @xmath12-band image ( using the stsdas task ellipse ) .",
    "total bulge luminosities @xmath4 were then derived using @xmath24 ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since these galaxies do not entirely fit on the acs / wfc images , it is not possible to estimate the total @xmath12-band luminosity using our images alone .",
    "assuming that the photometric growth curves of the target galaxies are the same for @xmath12 as for @xmath25 , since these two bands are reasonably close in wavelength , we apply the aperture correction from 14to infinity that is available from the 2mass catalog to derive the total @xmath12-band magnitude for each galaxy .",
    "@xmath14 values were determined for each galaxy from these values for the total luminosity and the bulge luminosity computed above .",
    "resulting values for @xmath26 , @xmath21 , and @xmath14 are listed in table  [ t : results ] .",
    "many gc systems have bimodal color distributions , which provide important clues to the formation of the host galaxies .",
    "since most previous studies of gc systems used @xmath27 colors , we transformed @xmath27 to @xmath28 using the galev simple stellar population models @xcite for an assumed age of 13 gyr .",
    "the galev models are calibrated to the acs filters and treat the chemical evolution of the gas and the spectral evolution of the stellar content simultaneously .",
    "they also include absorption as well as emission , both line and continuum . using the results of @xcite",
    ", we find that typical peaks for gc systems in e / s0 galaxies are expected to occur at @xmath28 values of 1.351.40 for the blue ( metal - poor ) clusters ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and 1.721.85 for the red ( metal - rich ) clusters . using the bulge luminosities of our sample galaxies ,",
    "the linear relations between peak @xmath27 color ( for both blue gcs and red gcs ) and elliptical galaxy luminosity of @xcite are used to predict @xmath28 colors to divide `` blue '' and `` red '' clusters .",
    "these colors are listed in table  [ t : results ] .",
    "figure  [ pos ] shows the positions of the red and blue cluster candidates on the @xmath12-band acs image .",
    "ngc  4710 is the nearest galaxy ( @xmath29 = 31.0 ) while the other three are more distant by a factor of 34 . as a result ,",
    "the acs image of ngc  4710 covers the smallest radial extent ( @xmath3014 kpc ) .",
    "therefore , we only consider gcs that lie within 14 kpc in all galaxies , and investigate whether or not their color distributions are bimodal using the kmm algorithm @xcite .",
    "we kept the dispersions the same for the two gaussians and found that the p - value ranged from 0.00 to 0.018 .",

    "we detect a dominating blue gc population at @xmath9  @xmath31 1.4 .",
    "this is consistent with the old , metal - poor cluster population seen in normal elliptical galaxies .",
    "we also clearly detect a redder population at @xmath9  @xmath31 1.8 in the more luminous galaxies , ngc  5308 and ngc  4866 and at @xmath9  @xmath31 1.6 in the less luminous galaxy , ngc  4710 .",
    "ngc  5475 does not show a significant red gc population .",
    "the peaks detected by the kmm algorithm are given in table  1 .",
    "the red peak colors at @xmath9  @xmath31 1.8 and 1.6 are consistent with the colors of old , metal - rich clusters seen in elliptical galaxies with similar ( bulge ) luminosities @xcite .",
    "reddening does not seem to be significant in the galaxies and we do not expect that any reddened  blue `` clusters were classified as  red '' since the kmm shows a clear bimodality . had the blue clusters been reddened considerably , we would have expected to see more clusters in the valley between the two gaussians and not a clear bimodality .",
    "a measurement of potential reddening in ellipticals by @xcite , using iras ( infrared ) data and optical colors , showed that any color gradient is small , with @xmath32 below 0.03 per dex .",
    "these results for ellipticals suggest that reddening should not significantly affect the colors of clusters in early - type galaxies , such as the ones studied here .",
    "we constructed the gc luminosity functions ( gclfs ) for the galaxies within the inner 14 kpc in the @xmath12-band after completeness corrections , and determined turn - over magnitudes ( @xmath33 ) by means of a gaussian fit .",
    "the total number of clusters within 14 kpc was computed by doubling the number of observed clusters brighter than @xmath33 ( cf . * ? ? ?",

    "using @xmath34 ratios and the relation between the spatial extent of gcs and the mass of the galaxy from @xcite , we estimate the extent of their gc systems to be @xmath3014 kpc ( ngc  5475 and ngc  4710 ) , 20 kpc ( ngc  5308 ) , and 35 kpc ( ngc  4866 ) .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ pos ] that we do not sample the full azimuthal extent of the gc system beyond a radius of 14 kpc in ngc  5308 and ngc  4866 . in fig .  [ den ]",
    "we show the number density ( number of clusters per sq .",
    "kpc ) vs the radial distance from the center of the galaxy for each target galaxy for the entire radial coverage in the acs image .",
    "we have also added the number density profile for the milky way for comparison .",
    "the bottom panels of fig .  [ den ] show that the radial density profiles of gcs from 14 kpc to 20 kpc in ngc  5308 and from 14 kpc to 35 kpc in ngc  4866 are similar to that in the milky way .",
    "hence , we used a ( scaled ) extrapolation of the gc system beyond 14 kpc from the milky way profile .    using the radial distribution of the metal - poor and metal - rich galactic gcs",
    "as determined from the current version of the @xcite catalog , we then estimate the total number of gcs in each of our sample galaxies and calculate the total specific frequency ( @xmath1 ) of the gc systems .",

    "we see that our blue @xmath1 values ( 0.34  0.84 ) mostly lie within the typical @xmath1 values for late - type spirals ( 0.55@xmath370.25 ) found by these authors .",
    "this strengthens the argument that gc systems of spirals are made of a universal halo - population of metal - poor gcs that are present in all galaxies .",
    "here , we focus on using the properties of the red gcs to better understand bulge assembly . the right panel of fig .",
    "[ snmb ] shows the relation between bulge luminosity and the total number of red gcs ( red symbols ) , as well as the number of red gcs located within 2@xmath38 of the bulge ( `` bulge '' gcs ; black symbols ) , for our sample plus the sa galaxies ngc  4594 @xcite and ngc  7814 @xcite .",
    "the total number of red gcs and bulge gcs clearly increase with bulge luminosity .",
    "the superimposed lines of constant specific frequency ( @xmath1 ) show that the specific frequency does not remain constant but changes with bulge luminosity .",
    "low - luminosity bulges ( with @xmath39 @xmath40 ) have lower values of @xmath1 than higher luminosity bulges .",
    "secular evolution leads to an increase in bulge luminosity without a corresponding increase in the number of bulge clusters , since the low star formation rates associated with secular building of bulges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) do not lead to the formation of clusters massive enough to survive a hubble time @xcite .",
    "secular evolution therefore predicts no trend in the number of bulge clusters with bulge luminosity . on the other hand , bulge assembly through vigorous star formation events such as those occurring during mergers or interactions of gas - rich galaxies _ is _ known to be associated with the formation of massive star clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the right panel of figure 4 indicates that the number of bulge clusters increases with bulge luminosity ( especially among the more luminous bulges ) , it seems fair to conclude that vigorous star formation events dominated secular evolution during the assembly history of those bulges .",
    "disruption of gcs , on both long and short timescales , can potentially affect @xmath1 .",
    "we first consider the two disruption processes that have the most significant impact on the long - term survival of bulge gcs : two - body relaxation ( sometimes called `` evaporation '' ) and dynamical friction .",
    "we only consider gcs brighter than or equal to the turnover luminosity , corresponding to a mass of @xmath41 m @xmath42 for an age of 12 gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since these are the only clusters used in the @xmath1 calculation . for evaporation",
    ", we use the simple parametrization of @xcite , which evolves an initial schechter function over time , at rates that depend on the internal density of the clusters .",
    "differences in age have a small effect on @xmath1 , at the @xmath43% level , since for a typical density , the number of clusters more massive than the turnoff decreases by only 12% between 1.5 and 12 gyr , and by 9.8% between 3 and 12 gyr .",
    "based on the data presented in @xcite , the sizes of red gcs are similar in the low and high - luminosity bulges of elliptical and s0 galaxies , over a similar range of cluster luminosities .",
    "this suggests that the internal densities , and hence the evaporation rates , are also similar for ( bulge ) gcs in galaxies with very different bulge luminosities . over a hubble time",
    ", dynamical friction will destroy gcs within two effective radii of the bulge if they are more massive than @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 is the total mass of the host galaxy ) @xcite .",
    "the largest effect will therefore occur for gcs more massive than @xmath46 m @xmath42 in ngc  5475 , our lowest - luminosity galaxy , with @xmath47 ( @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 m@xmath42 assuming @xmath51 for an sa galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) ) .",
    "clusters this massive only represent a fraction @xmath52 of a typical gc mass function",
    ". therefore , we do not expect processes that affect gcs on long timescales to impact the @xmath1 values plotted in fig .  4 at much more than the 10% level , which is smaller than the typical uncertainty in @xmath1 .",
    "processes that disrupt clusters on shorter ( @xmath53  yr ) timescales are not as well understood as evaporation and dynamical friction , nor is it known whether the processes which disrupt young clusters in galaxies today are similar to those experienced by gcs during their youth .",
    "there is however , recent evidence which suggests that the early disruption of clusters in nearby galaxies does not vary strongly from galaxy to galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because it is dominated mainly by processes internal to the clusters themselves .",
    "if this was also true for the early evolution of gcs , then disruption processes in general should not have impacted @xmath1 differently from galaxy to galaxy .",

    ". however , the fraction of bulge gcs are generally consistent with those expected from merging processes for galaxies with higher luminosity bulges , ngc  4866 and ngc  4594 .",
    "ngc  4866 has a relatively large @xmath38 , and the high value observed for the bulge clusters in the right panel of fig  [ fr ] is likely due to the inclusion of some disk clusters .",

    "<S> we use deep _ hubble space telescope _ images taken with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in the f475w and f814w filters to investigate the globular cluster systems in four edge - on sa spiral galaxies covering a factor of 4 in luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the specific frequencies of the blue globular clusters in the galaxies in our sample fall in the range 0.34  0.84 , similar to typical values found for later - type spirals . </S>",
    "<S> the number of red globular clusters associated with the bulges generally increases with the bulge luminosity , similar to what is observed for elliptical galaxies , although the specific frequency of bulge clusters is a factor of 2 - 3 lower for the lowest luminosity bulges than for the higher luminosity bulges . </S>",
    "<S> we present a new empirical relation between the fraction of red globular clusters and total bulge luminosity based on the elliptical galaxies studied by acsvcs ( acs virgo cluster survey ) , and discuss how this diagram can be used to assess the importance that dissipative processes played in building spiral bulges . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest a picture where dissipative processes , which are expected during gas - rich major mergers , were more important for building luminous bulges of sa galaxies , whereas secular evolution may have played a larger role in building lower - luminosity bulges in spirals . </S>"
