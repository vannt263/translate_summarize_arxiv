    "driven by the network densification and increasing number of smart - phones , tablets and netbooks , mobile operators are compelled to find viable solutions to maximize their network performance in a cost - effective manner .",
    "heterogeneous network ( hetnets ) deployments combining various cell sizes ( femto , pico , relays ) and radio access technologies ( @xmath1g/@xmath2g / wi - fi ) , are expected to become cornerstones for future heterogeneous wireless cellular networks , aiming at substantially higher data rates and spatial reuse @xcite .",
    "hetnets are currently studied within the @xmath3 generation partnership project ( @xmath1gpp ) standardization body , where mechanisms including time- and frequency - domain intercell interference coordination ( icic ) with adaptive resource partitioning , cell range expansion ( cre ) , and interference coordination / cancellation take central stage @xcite . in this article , we focus on one of these important aspects , namely self - organizing networks ( son ) .",
    "@xmath1gpp has defined son as one of the most important standardization features for mobile operators today for the operation , management , and maintenance of their radio access networks ( rans ) cost - efficiently , without relying on human intervention @xcite .",
    "son in hetnets is expected to gain more importance as networks are getting denser and becoming more heterogeneous in size , access technology , and backhauls .",
    "endowed with self - configuring , self - optimizing and self - healing capabilities , mobile operators can optimize their networks in a totally decentralized manner , in which the traffic load is balanced among tiers , significantly reducing their operation and capital expenditures ( opex / capex ) , and ultimately satisfying users quality - of - service ( qos ) requirements .",
    "based on the self - organizing capabilities of hetnets , we propose solutions to _ smartly _ offload traffic to open access picocells and thereby achieve cell splitting gains for both time- and frequency - domain icic techniques .",
    "we focus on the downlink transmission as this has been identified as a more critical intercell interference scenario within hetnets  @xcite .",
    "open access picocells are cells that provide access to any user equipment ( ue ) within their coverage area . as ues generally connect to the cell that provides the strongest downlink ( dl ) received signal , dl intercell interference can be reduced . however ,",
    "if all ues connect to the macrocell due to their large transmit power , rather than to picocells at shorter distance with lesser number of ues , the traffic load will be unevenly distributed in the network . as a result",
    ", the macrocell will be overloaded whereas picocells will be under - utilized  @xcite . as a remedy to this , the concept of cre was proposed as a cell selection procedure , in which a positive bias is added to the picocell s dl received signal to increase its dl footprint .",
    "this bias balances the load among the macro- and picocell tier by forcing mobile users to handover to picocells , even if the picocell s dl received signal is lower .",
    "nevertheless , an aggressive range expansion may cause high interference to picocell ues ( pues ) located in the picocell expanded regions ( er ) ; this is because er pues do not connect to the cells with the strongest dl received signal , thus suffering from low dl signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratios ( sinrs )  @xcite .",
    "in addition , due to the non - uniform traffic and user distribution , picocells need to self - organize for effectively offloading macrocell s traffic . with this in mind ,",
    "_ intelligent _ and flexible cell range expansion techniques across time and frequency must be devised for macro- and picocells , to mitigate excessive dl inter - cell interference suffered by er pues , while at the same time not jeopardizing pue qos requirements .",
    "in this section , we summarize the concepts of range expansion and time / frequency domain icic in hetnets and discuss related works from the literature to better present our contributions .      in order to benefit from the deployment of heterogeneous and small cell networks ,",
    "range expansion icic techniques have been proposed , in which picocells increase their footprint so as to balance the load among tiers and achieve cell - splitting gains . in what follows ,",
    "we revisit and summarize both the range expansion and icic concepts .",
    "@xmath1gpp has studied the concept of cre through handover biasing and resource partitioning among nodes with different levels of transmission powers @xcite .",
    "the biasing mechanism allows load balancing among tiers , where depending on the bias value , more ues can be associated to picocells . in this approach ,",
    "the bias value is an offset added to the received power of picocells in order to increase its dl coverage area .",
    "cre significantly reduces the dl signal quality of those users in the expanded region ( i.e. , er pues ) , because they are connected to cells that do not provide the best dl received signal .",
    "these interference problems may significantly degrade the overall network performance , calling for intelligent icic schemes to benefit from range expansion and improve the performance of er pues .",
    "since icic schemes specified in @xmath1gpp lte release @xmath4 do not specifically consider hetnet settings , enhancements of these techniques have been proposed to efficiently mitigate interference in subsequent releases of the lte standard  @xcite . in particular , the icic techniques in @xmath1gpp release @xmath5 ,",
    "can be grouped into four categories : time - domain , frequency - domain , power based and antenna / spatial - based techniques @xcite .",
    "there is a sizeable body of literature on the use of cre for traffic load balancing in hetnets ; see e.g. @xcite and the references listed therein . in @xcite , closed - form expressions are derived to calculate cre bias values for different range expansion strategies .",
    "moreover , a cooperative scheduling scheme is proposed to mitigate interference caused by macrocells onto er pues . to improve dl capacity and users fairness ,",
    "the authors propose a new subframe blanking based cell selection procedure in @xcite .",
    "using tools from stochastic geometry , analytical models accounting for base station ( bs ) and ue locations have been studied to analyze spectral efficiencies in range expanded picocell networks in @xcite , which has later been extended to icic scenarios in  @xcite . in @xcite , the throughput performance of different cre values and different ratios of protected resources were carried out based on system level simulations .",
    "in addition to time domain interference coordination approaches , frequency domain interference coordination techniques have also been considered in the literature for interference management and load balancing purposes . in this context ,",
    "multi - flow carrier aggregation ( ca ) , in which users are served by different layers on different component carriers ( ccs ) , has and remains an open and challenging problem . a related approach to provide",
    "an efficient and flexible network performance improvement is to split the control and user plane ( c - and u - plane ) .",
    "this concept was introduced and discussed in @xcite whereby , the c - plane is provided at low frequency band to maintain good connectivity and mobility . on the other hand ,",
    "the u - plane is provided by both the macrocells and the small cells ( deployed at higher frequency bands ) for data transfer . since",
    "small cells are not configured with cell - specific signals and channels , they are named _ phantom cells _  @xcite .      the main contribution of this article is to propose decentralized solutions for joint power control and cell association in a hetnet scenario , in both time and frequency domain . in the time - domain , pico base stations ( pbss )",
    "_ optimally _ learn their cre bias and power allocation , while satisfying their own pues qos requirements . in turn , the macrocell self - organizes so as to serve its own macro ues ( mues ) , while adhering to the picocell interference constraint .",
    "in contrast to the _ homogeneous _ case where all pbss use the same bias value , the proposed solution is dynamic and self - organizing in nature , where the ran autonomously optimizes the cre bias values of the picocells through a loose coordination with the macrocell tier .",
    "the ue adds these bias values to its measurements , to check whether a measurement report needs to be sent to its serving bs .",
    "the pbss , upon coordination with the mbs , learn the cre bias values and notify the mbs via the x2 interface .    in the frequency - domain",
    ", we consider : ( a ) the single - flow ca , where users are served by only one bs at a time , and ( b ) the multi - flow ca , in which a ue can be simultaneously served by two ( or more ) bss from different layers / tiers , but on two different ccs .",
    "our proposed learning based solution is validated using a long term evolution advanced ( lte - a ) system level simulator , through a comparison with a number of benchmark solutions such as resource partitioning and static cre .",
    "it is worth noting that most of the existing icic and load balancing techniques are simulated in simplified hetnet scenarios with homogeneity inside the macro layer as well as the pico layer ; by considering the same cre for all picocells in the network .",
    "the major difference between our contribution and existing techniques is that we propose a joint optimization approach , in which each picocell individually learns its optimum icic strategy .",
    "this is achieved by optimizing the picocell s cre bias selection and power allocation strategies in coordination with the macrocell .",
    "in contrast to existing approaches , our solution is based on reinforcement learning , which is a widely accepted tool in dynamic wireless networks and allows to investigate how bss interact over time and attempt to optimize their utility  @xcite .",
    "we propose a reinforcement learning framework , in which not only the picocells but also the macrocell perform load balancing and power control . the challenge of this approach lies in effectively offloading the ues from the macrocells , while simultaneously maintaining the qos requirements of pues . by enabling coordination between both layers and considering the performance of mues and pues , the proposed techniques are seen as a promising approach to overcome this challenge .",

    "in this section , we first describe the time - domain icic approach in order to introduce our self - organizing learning procedures in time domain .",
    "our first approach leverages a dynamic reinforcement learning procedure in which picocells optimally learn their cre bias in a heterogeneous deployment of picocells .",
    "moreover , the macrocell learns which mues to schedule and on which rbs , while taking into account the picocell resource allocation . to do that",
    ", we consider a _ two - level _ approach with loose coordination among macro and picocell tiers , in which the ran autonomously optimizes the cre bias value of picocells . at the same time",
    "the picocells dynamically learn their transmit power levels to maximize the overall system performance .",
    "we propose a @xmath49-learning formulation , which consists of a set @xmath50 of pbss and a set @xmath51 of mbss , denoted as the players / agents .",
    "we define a set of states @xmath52 and actions @xmath53 aiming at finding a policy that minimizes the observed costs over the interaction time of the players .",

    "for all players , individual @xmath49-tables maintain their knowledge of the environment to take autonomous decisions based on local and limited information .",

    "policy @xmath57 for each state @xmath54 , so as to minimize the cumulative costs over time .    in some cases ,",
    "optimality is not aimed at , and thus less complex algorithms are preferred , in which agents are solely interested in guaranteeing a certain level of satisfaction to their users . therefore , our second approach considers a satisfaction - based learning procedure based on game theory , which is a decentralized algorithm allowing players to self - configure so as to achieve satisfaction equilibria .",
    "this approach guarantees that the qos requirements are satisfied in the network .",
    "the idea of satisfaction equilibrium was introduced in @xcite , in which agents having partial or no knowledge about their environment are solely interested in the satisfaction of some individual performance constraints instead of individual performance optimization . here",
    ", we consider a satisfaction based game formulation that enables players ( i.e. , pbss ) to autonomously adapt their strategies to guarantee a certain level of qos to ues when optimality is not aimed for .    the main difference between @xmath49-learning and satisfaction learning stems from the fact the former approach minimizes the total cost over time by trying different actions ( trials and errors ) as well as striking a balance between exploration and exploitation . as its name suggests , the latter algorithm guarantees that a given pbs does not update its strategy as long as its performance metric is satisfied .",
    "the rationale for using both algorithms is to underscore the tradeoffs of optimality vs. satisfaction .",
    "rest of this section briefly summarizes the operation of classical time domain icic , and subsequently provides further details about the proposed @xmath49-learning and satisfaction based learning time - domain icic and load balancing techniques .",
    "the basic idea of time - domain icic is that an aggressor node ( i.e. mbs ) creates protected subframes for a victim node ( i.e. pbs ) by reducing its transmission power in certain subframes .",
    "these subframes are called almost blank subframes ( abs ) .",
    "notably , in co - channel deployments , abss are used to reduce interference created by transmitting nodes while providing full legacy support .",

    "[ fig : tdfdcre ] , if the pbs schedules its pues which have low sinrs in subframes @xmath59 , it protects such pues from strong inter - cell interference .          for the problem formulation of @xmath49-learning",
    ", we divide the problem into a bias value selection and power allocation sub - problems .",
    "these two sub - problems are inter - related in which each picocell , as a player , individually selects first a bias value for cre by considering its own pues qos requirements , after which the transmit power is optimally allocated . additionally , we consider the mbs as a second type of player , which performs learning after the picocell has selected its bias values and transmit power levels per rb .",
    "we name this learning approach as _ dynamic _ @xmath49-learning , in which the picocell informs the mbs which rbs are used for scheduling er pues through the x@xmath60 interface .",
    "these rbs will be protected by the mbs by using lower power levels . in case of more than one pbs",
    ", the mbs considers the protected rbs of all pbss , and optimizes its transmit power allocation on these protected rbs as well as on the remaining rbs . formally speaking ,",
    "the player , state , action and perceived cost associated to the q - learning procedure are defined as follows :    * * player : * pbs @xmath61 and mbs @xmath62 . *",
    "* state : * the state representation of player @xmath44 at time @xmath19 in rb @xmath18 is given by the vector state @xmath63 .",

    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 is the instantaneous sinr of ue @xmath23 in db in rb @xmath18 , and @xmath67 db is the target sinr value . in our state definition ,",
    "we consider both mue and pue interference levels , which implies that both players optimize both type of ues states .",
    "we consider a target sinr of 20  db and define a range within which the instantaneous sinr is satisfied .",
    "this range is selected to be small , i.e. , @xmath68  db  @xcite , to be close to the target sinr . the main motivation for defining such a range is that it is very difficult to maintain exact sinr values for each of the ues at each bs . in particular , even when a ue s sinr is very close to the target sinr , if an exact sinr is aimed , the ue will be considered not to be in the targeted state , hence yielding stability problems .",
    "we consider the range of @xmath68  db to be ` acceptable ' , because we target a bler of @xmath69 , which is required for lte systems  @xcite .",
    "according to our link - to - system level mapping look - up table , this target bler still holds for the second largest cqi value 14 . in this case , the sinr decreases by 2 db .",
    "hence , we selecta 2 db degradation as an ` acceptable ' range for the target sinr and since the cost function is parabolic , we consider a symmetric range of @xmath68  db . *",

    "it has to be pointed out that the bias value setting will influence the convergence behavior of the learning algorithm and that the presented bias values have been selected experimentally . for player @xmath74 ,",
    "the action set is defined as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the transmit power level of mbs @xmath16 over a set of rbs @xmath73 .",
    "different power levels are defined for protected rbs .",
    "* * cost : * the considered cost in rb @xmath18 of player @xmath44 is given by @xmath77 the rationale behind this cost function is that the @xmath49-learning aims to minimize its cost , so that the sinr at ue @xmath23 is close to a selected target value @xmath78 .",
    "considering a cost function with a minimum as target sinr as in , will enable the player to develop a strategy that leads to sinr values close to the target sinr .",
    "the target sinr is set to be 20 db , and this corresponds to a maximum cqi level of 15 in typical look - up tables  @xcite .",
    "therefore , setting an sinr target of @xmath79  db is considered as a reasonable optimization goal for the proposed @xmath49-learning approach .",
    "the considered cost of 500 is only for the case that the total transmit power @xmath80 is larger than the maximum transmit power of a bs .",
    "it provides the best performance and convergence trade - off in our simulations as shown in section  [ sec : convergence ] and has been heuristically selected  @xcite .",

    "hence , @xmath49-learning is an iterative procedure in which the previous knowledge ( @xmath90 ) is updated by considering the newly obtained knowledge represented by the cost value @xmath81 and estimates of future costs @xmath89 .",

    "only the pbs is carrying out the decentralized learning procedure , and informs the mbs about the rbs allocated to er pues to be considered as abss .",

    "hence , instead of @xmath91 only @xmath92 information is stored in the satisfaction based learning .",

    "the pbs performs cre on cc1 to offload the macrocell and serves its er pue on this cc , so that the mbs is the interfering bs in cc1 . in cc2 , the pbs does not perform cre , so that the er pue is only served on cc1 and the remaining pues can be served on cc2 .",
    "hence , single - flow ca enables ues to connect to one bs at a time .",
    "a recent feature in 3gpp release-12 , referred to as multi - flow ca , enables a better use of resources and improves system capacity .",
    "as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfsf ] ( b ) , in multi - flow ca multiple bss ( from different tiers ) simultaneously transmit data to a ue on different ccs @xcite .",
    "while the mbs remains still the aggressor cell on cc1 , in which pbs perform cre , it becomes the serving cell on cc2 .",
    "hence , in single - flow ca , ues associate with only one of the available tiers at a given time and in multi - flow ca based hetnets , ues can be served by both macro- and picocells at the same time .",
    "this necceciates a smart mechanism in which the different tiers coordinate their transmission through adaptive cell range expansion across different ccs .",
    "we divide the single - flow ca problem into primary cc selection , bias value selection and power allocation sub - problems .",
    "these three sub - problems are inter - related in which the pbs and mbs ( as players ) learn their optimal icic strategy , which is presented in algorithm i. the pbs first selects its optimal cc to perform cre , then the bias value for cre in the selected cc , after which the transmit power is allocated accordingly .",
    "hence , we consider a three - stage decision making process , in which the mbs is informed about the pbs s primary cc via the x@xmath60 interface .",
    "the mbs selects pbs s secondary cc as its primary cc and learns its optimal power allocation strategy . in a network with more than one pbs and more than one cc , each pbs may select different ccs as their primary cc . in this case",
    ", we propose that the mbs selects that ccs as its primary cc , which has been selected by less number of pbss . in case of equality , the cc which will lead to larger performance degradation caused my mbs interference",
    "is selected .",
    "while mbs selects low power levels on its secondary ( pbs s primary ) cc , it selects higher power levels on its primary cc .",
    "the rationale behind considering two different power levels for mbs s primary and secondary cc , is to reduce interference on er pues , which are served on pbs s primary cc .",
    "the main difference with the dynamic time domain icic learning procedure discussed in section iv is in the action definition .",
    "hence , we redefine our action formulation as follows :    * * action : * for player pbs @xmath17 the action set is defined as , @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the selected component carrier to perform cre on the selected cc , @xmath134 db is the bias value for cre on selected @xmath135 of pbs @xmath17 and @xmath72 is the transmit power level of pbs @xmath17 over a set of rbs @xmath73 .",
    "hence , the pbss will independently learn which cc it performs range expansion , with which bias value , and how to optimally perform power allocation .",
    "+ for player mbs @xmath16 the action set is defined as , @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the transmit power level of mbs @xmath16 over a set of rbs @xmath73 on cc @xmath138 .",
    "different power levels are defined for mbs s primary and secondary ccs .",
    "select primary cc @xmath139 select bias value @xmath140 for primary cc @xmath141 select power level @xmath72 according to @xmath142 on both ccs inform player @xmath16 about primary cc @xmath141 select player @xmath17 s secondary cc as primary cc @xmath143 select bias value @xmath144 for primary cc @xmath143 select power level @xmath145 according to @xmath146 receive an immediate cost @xmath81 observe the next state @xmath86 update the table entry according to equation @xmath147      in contrast to the single - flow ca in which the mbs is always the aggressor cell , in multi - flow ca either the mbs or the pbs is the aggressor cell .",
    "this is because both mbs and pbs perform cre on their primary ccs , so that a ue can be served on different ccs by different bss based on its biased received power .",
    "similar to the single - flow ca learning algorithm , the multi - flow ca based icic learning algorithm assumes pbs and mbs as players .",
    "the main difference with the single - flow ca based icic learning algorithm , is the action definition , which is highlighted in the if - condition in line 11 of algorithm [ alg : singleflowca ] .    * * action : * for player pbs @xmath17 the action set is defined as , @xmath132 , and for player mbs @xmath16 the action set is defined as , @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the component carrier index that can be selected in order to perform cre on the selected cc , @xmath150 db is the bias value for cre on selected cc @xmath138 , and @xmath151 is the transmit power level over a set of rbs @xmath73 .",
    "hence , the pbss and mbs will independently learn which cc they perform range expansion , with which bias value and how to optimally perform the power allocation .",
    "since , both pbs and mbs can be aggressor cells , different power levels are considered for ccs on which the bss perform cre , and the regular ccs which do not have cre .",
    "+ in addition , we consider the case of one player formulation , in which the pbs is the player . in this case",
    ", pbs carries out the multi - flow ca based @xmath49-learning procedure and informs mbs about its primary cc and mbs uses reduced power levels on this cc .",
    "however , even if no cre is performed by the mbs , a ue can be served by both pbs and mbs on different ccs at the same time .",
    "this learning algorithm will be coined as _ mf static ql _ while the two player algorithm is named _ mf dynamic ql_.    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in satisfaction based learning , one learning iteration is based on the probability update function in equation , which is only updated if the system is not satisfied .",
    "the third column of table [ tab : qcompcost ] summarizes for this case the total number of operations required per rb .",
    "the total number of operations required for @xmath49-learning and satisfaction based learning is @xmath152 and @xmath153 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath154 , satisfaction based learning requires less operations than @xmath49-learning .",
