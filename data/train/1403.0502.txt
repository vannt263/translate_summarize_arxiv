    "the variation of the overall dust - to - metals ratios between galaxies of vastly different morphology , ages and metallicities appears surprisingly small in many cases , with a mean value close to the galactic ratio ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the relatively tight correlation between the dust - to - gas ratio and the metallicity ( yielding an almost invariant dust - to - metals ratio ) in the local group galaxies has been known for quite a while ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite argue this can only be explained by either rapid dust enrichment by supernovae or very rapid interstellar grain growth by accretion of metals",

    "* ) , although the existence of dust - to - metals gradients is somewhat difficult to establish observationally with reliable independent methods . if , on the other hand , the dust - to - metals ratio does not vary much at all , in any environment , one may assume dust grains as well as atomic metals are mainly produced by stars .",
    "recent findings of large amounts of cold dust in supernova ( sn ) remnants @xcite seem to support this hypothesis , although the exact numbers can be disputed @xcite . in other words : the overall picture is not consistent .",
    "a new study by @xcite seems to confirm the rising trend with metallicity of the dust - to - metals ratio in quasar dlas found in previous studies @xcite .",

    "2012 ) derived a dust mass in the local starburst dwarf i zw 18 , as well as a high - redshift object of similar character , which clearly indicate a dust - to - metals ratio below the galactic value .",
    "these results , together with the likely existence of dust - to - metals gradients along galaxy discs @xcite , suggest the variance ( or invariance ) of the dust - to - metals ratio may depend on the environment . in such case",
    ", there may exist an equilibrium mechanism that keeps the dust - to - metals ratio close to constant if certain conditions are fulfilled , while a metallicity dependence may occur as a result of deviations from those conditions in other environments .",
    "recently , @xcite have tried to alleviate the tension between the results from the grb afterglows of @xcite and other data ( for local dwarf galaxies ) by fine - tuning the parameters of their standard galactic dust evolution model including grain growth @xcite .",
    "what they suggest is a quite reasonable compromise , but a truly convincing explanation of the different trends ( constant and rising dust - to - metals ratio ) would require some modification of the dust - formation scenario",
    ". in particular , a model in which inherent properties of a galaxy more or less uniquely determines its dust - to - metals ratio would be desirable .",
    "even if the models by @xcite are marginally consistent with the data they compare with , there is obviously still some tension between models and observations . the new results by @xcite only act as to emphasise this . in the standard picture of production and destruction of cosmic dust one",
    "is faced with the following two problems : ( 1 ) in metal - poor environments dust is only supplied by stars as the interstellar density of metals is too low for efficient grain growth , but still being destroyed by sn shockwaves ( albeit with a relatively low efficiency ) ; ( 2 ) to compensate the destruction of dust grains , which eventually becomes efficient , with grain growth requires that one pushes the boundaries of the model , i.e. , to obtain a sufficiently short grain - growth timescale , one is forced to accept a very large span of gas densities ( several orders of magnitude ) and a very low star - formation efficiency .",
    "these problems are discussed in more detail by @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a scenario for the evolution of the galactic dust component where destruction of grains due to sputtering in sn shockwaves is roughly balanced by grain growth by accretion of molecular gas .",
    "this idea has also been put forth in other studies to improve models of the build - up of dust in the local as well as distant ( early ) universe ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but here we take it one step further and consider a model where there can be an _ exact _ balance .",
    "given a constant ratio of the effective dust yield and the total metal yield for a generation of stars , such a scenario will lead to an invariant dust - to - metals ratio .",
    "we continue by discussing the possibility that young undeveloped ( low metallicity ) systems may have a different yield ratio due to different dust yields for individual stars ( e.g. , the expected metallicity dependence ) .",
    "recently , @xcite derived a correlation between the optical depth in the @xmath1-band @xmath3 and the stellar - mass surface density @xmath4 in nearby spiral galaxies selected from the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) survey , which were detected in the fir / sub - mm in the herschel - atlas field .",
    "they find a nearly linear relation , @xmath5 where the errors reflect the @xmath6 scatter in the data .",
    "the regression is marginally consistent with an exactly linear correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "if the dust density @xmath7 is proportional to the stellar - mass density @xmath8 , there should exist a linear correlation between the optical depth @xmath9 and the corrected , de - projected surface density of a galaxy , much like the relation above , because of the connection with the dust abundance , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite , argue that their relation is evidence of efficient interstellar grain growth .",
    "this conclusion depends on whether stars , primarily massive stars , can make a significant contribution to the dust production and on the efficiency of dust destruction in the interstellar medium ( ism ) . in principle",
    ", the @xmath11 connection only says that dust and stars go hand - in - hand in local spiral galaxies , which seems to suggest significant stellar dust production and that destruction of dust must be balanced by grain growth in the ism .",
    "however , as we will go on to show later , this is not necessarily the case .",
    "a constant dust - to - metals ratio does not only seem to apply in the local universe , however .",
    "@xcite combine extinction ( @xmath12 values ) and abundance data from grb afterglows with similar data from qso foreground absorbers and multiply - imaged galaxy - lensed qsos , to determine the dust - to - metals ratios for a wide range of galaxy types and redshifts of @xmath13 , and almost three orders in metal abundance .",
    "the mean dust - to - metals ratio for their sample is very close to the galactic value and the @xmath6 deviation is no more than 0.3 dex , suggesting the dust - to - metals ratio may be fairly invariant throughout the observable universe .",
    "_ chandra _ x - ray observations of distant lens galaxies lend further support to this picture @xcite . taken at face value",
    ", these results would imply a very rapid dust - formation scenario that is roughly the same in any environment .",
    "the number of data points at low metallicity is relatively small in the work by @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not certain * that * the dust - to - metals ratio is nearly invariant also at low metallicities .",
    "a very recent study by @xcite has shown , using a different method , that there is likely a turn - down in the dust - to - metals ratio at low metallicity .",
    "this is also consistent with the constraint on the dust - to - metals ratio derived for the local starburst galaxy i zw 18 @xcite .",
    "@xcite measure the degrees of depletion of gas - phase abundances in the ism for various elements , particularly focusing on fe and zn , and infer the dust abundance from these depletions .",
    "the dust - depletion patterns are observed in uv / optical grb afterglows and qso spectra , associated with the ism of the grb host - galaxies and qso - dlas , and are derived assuming that the depletion is entirely due to dust condensation , regardless of its origin . in particular , the method used by @xcite relies on the assumption that the observed [ zn / fe ] traces the overall dust content in the ism , and thus that ( 1 ) the intrinsic relative abundance of zn and fe is solar and ( 2 ) a non - negligible amount of iron is present in the bulk of the dust .",
    "this is not obviously the case due to uncertainties in the origins of zn and fe , but investigating the reliability of these assumptions - and thus the exact slope of the trend of the dust - to - metals ratio with metallicity - goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "what is particularly interesting about the new results by @xcite is that the dust - to - metals ratio increases with increasing metallicity and , even more important , with increasing metal _",
    "density_. the latter is a clear indication of grain growth being an important part of the build up of the dust mass .",
    "further evidence from dlas of a down - turn in the dust - to - metals ratio at low metallicity is seen in the works by , e.g. , @xcite . a similar ,",
    "although somewhat steeper , down - turn of the dust - to-_gas _ ratio was also recently found by @xcite for low - metallicity galaxies in the local universe .",
    "in a gaseous medium of a given temperature and density , the rate of accretion of a gas - phase species @xmath14 onto a spherical dust grain is given by the surface area of the grain ( @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the grain radius ) and the sticking coefficient ( probability ) @xmath17 for that species ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the mass density of a species @xmath14 locked up in dust @xmath18 then grows at a rate @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes mass density per unit volume of the growth species @xmath14 , @xmath21 is the mean thermal speed of the gas particles , @xmath22 is the effective ( average ) grain size and @xmath23 is the material bulk density of the dust .",
    "thus , the overall timescale of grain growth @xmath24 is , to first approximation , inversely proportional to the difference between total metallicity @xmath25 and the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath26 and can therefore be approximated using @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the density of molecular hydrogen . here ,",
    "the grain size , sticking probability , thermal speed of the gas particles and their molecular composition have been regarded as more or less invariant quantities .    for simplicity we will assume that the star formation rate is proportional to the molecular gas abundance .",
    "thus , @xmath29 .",
    "we can then regard the timescale @xmath24 as essentially just a simple function of the metallicity , the gas abundance and the growth rate of the stellar component .",
    "following @xcite we adopt @xmath30 where the constant @xmath31 can be treated as a unit less free ( but constrained ) parameter of the model , representing the overall efficiency of grain growth .",
    "the dominant mechanism for dust destruction is by sputtering in the high - velocity interstellar shocks driven by sne , which can be directly related to the energy of the sne @xcite .",
    "following @xcite the dust destruction time - scale is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the gas mass density , @xmath34 is the effective gas mass cleared of dust by each sn event , and @xmath35 is the sn rate per unit volume . the latter may be approximated as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and @xmath38 is the star - formation rate per unit volume . for a non - evolving imf",
    "the integral in equation ( [ snr ] ) is a constant with respect to time , and is not expected to vary much spatially within a galaxy either .",
    "hence , the time scale @xmath39 may be expressed as @xmath40 where @xmath41 will be referred to as the dust destruction parameter .",
    "this parameter is dimensionless , and as such it can be seen as a measure of the overall efficiency of dust destruction .    small grains are more susceptible to destruction by sputtering in sn shock waves than large grains @xcite .",
    "this is due to the larger grains tendency to decouple from the gas and thus being less exposed to ions .",
    "this fact suggests the above model is , partially , an inadequate description of the effects of destruction due to sn shocks .",
    "grain - grain interaction may lead to shattering and thus creation of smaller grains @xcite , which are then more likely to be sputtered away .",
    "hence , the timescale of dust destruction may not only be inversely proportional to the sn rate , but also the abundance of dust , since the rate of interactions ( or collisions ) is proportional to the number density @xmath42 .",
    ", where @xmath43 is the effective cross - section for grain - grain collisions , @xmath42 is the number density of dust grains and @xmath44 is the typical relative velocity of two colliding grains . using @xmath45 we may define the _ collision density _ as @xmath46 .",
    "the factor @xmath47 has been introduced to avoid double - counting the collisions .",
    "obviously , the collision density is proportional to @xmath48 since @xmath49 .",
    "the efficiency of dust destruction is roughly proportional to the shattering rate , since smaller fragments are more easily destroyed , and the shattering rate is to first order proportional to the collision rate , which sketchily motivates the modified model of dust destruction suggested above . ]",
    "a reasonable modification to the dust - destruction timescale would then be to introduce a dependence on the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the present - day galactic dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "the dust - destruction efficiency @xmath41 can be calibrated to the expected efficiency ( timescale ) for the galaxy , which we take to be roughly 0.7 gyr @xcite .",
    "the effective galactic gas - consumption rate is about @xmath52  pc@xmath53  gyr@xmath54 , and the gas density is @xmath55  pc@xmath53 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and referenes therein ) , which implies @xmath56 .",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath57 based on a @xcite imf and that stars of initial masses above @xmath58 become sne .",
    "we can thus assume @xmath59 is a reasonable estimate of the expected range for @xmath41 .",
    "in @xcite we showed that dust growth would be the most important mechanism for changing the dust - to - metals ratio @xmath60 in a galaxy throughout its course of evolution and/or create a dust - to - metals gradient along a galaxy disc .",
    "since , in the present work , we want to also consider the situations where @xmath60 is not changing much , we will focus on the two viable scenarios for dust production : ( 1 ) pure stellar dust production and inefficient dust destruction and ( 2 ) a scenario where dust destruction is balanced by dust growth in the ism .    to simplify our model",
    "we make the same assumptions as in @xcite and @xcite , i.e. , a galaxy evolves effectively as a ` closed box ' and the stellar dust / metals production can be described under the instantaneous recycling approximation .",
    "we also assume the effects of the inevitably chaining grain - size distribution are negligible on average , so that grain growth and destruction are functions of macroscopic properties only as described in the next subsection .",
    "furthermore , we make the assumption that the fraction of condensible metals ( metals that may end up in dust grains ) @xmath61 is essentially the same as the total metallicity , i.e. , @xmath62 .",
    "this assumption is quite reasonable as the observed depletion is surprisinglingy close to 100% for many of the most abundant metals except oxygen and the noble gases ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the equation for the evolution of the dust - to - metals ratio @xmath63 is then @xcite , @xmath64- \\zeta,\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the rate of increase of the dust mass due to grain growth relative to the rate of gas consumption due to star formation , @xmath66 is the corresponding function for dust destruction and @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the effective stellar dust and metal yields , respectively .",
    "the dust yield @xmath67 may have a significant dependence on the metallicity of the stellar population , which we will return to later . in terms of the timescales for grain growth and destruction above",

    "thus , the dust masses in young starbursts , like i zw18 , should give us a measure of the stellar dust yield @xmath67 ( at least for low metallicities ) .",
    "this may also give a hint about the origin of the @xmath77 connection seen in the results by @xcite , i.e. , that we should consider a model where a balance between growth and destruction leads to a similar @xmath78 relation for more evolved systems .    if we include interstellar dust destruction with a timescale given by eq .",

    "in reality , one would expect deviations from an exactly constant dust - to - metals ratio to occur as a consequence of local variations of the yield ratio @xmath119 together with @xmath108 and @xmath31 .",
    "the latter two parameters are clearly different for different dust compositions and may also have implicit dependences on the gas density and , perhaps most importantly , on the grain - size distribution , which can only be ` universal on average ' .    for the case @xmath120 ( neither dust growth , nor destruction ) we have the trivial solution @xmath90 , which is of course identical to the equilibrium case above .",
    "the effective stellar dust yield @xmath67 has so far been treated as a constant .",
    "to first order , this is an acceptable approximation , but as we are here interested in dust production at very low metallicity it is necessary to consider a scenario in which @xmath67 is a function of the metallicity @xmath25 .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , some key - elements for dust production ( such as silicon ) may be less abundant in low - metallicity stars .",
    "this is obviously the case for the massive , short - lived , agb stars which are producing mainly silicates , but has no ( or very little ) silicon production of their own .",
    "second , dust condensation is strongly dependent on the absolute abundance / density of the relevant metals .",
    "that is , there may exist a critical metallicity below which dust condensation become inefficient due to low partial pressures for many metals , leading to less nucleation and slow accretion .",
    "it is already well established that such a critical metallicity exists for grain growth in the ism ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this can be the case also in massive stars which , despite that they produce significant amounts of metals , may have too low partial pressures of certain key - elements to have efficient nucleation .",
    "a very simple scenario would be the one where @xmath67 is simply proportional to the metallicity @xmath25 .",
    "assuming interstellar dust processing has no effect on the dust mass fraction of the ism ( @xmath121 or @xmath122 ) and @xmath123 , where @xmath124 , @xmath125 are constants , we have @xmath126 which has the simple solution [ with initial condition @xmath127 @xmath128 this model produces a rising trend as seen in several observations , but is otherwise not very realistic .",
    "first , there is no ` roof ' in the solution above .",
    "@xmath60 can continue to grow even beyond the absolute upper limit @xmath129 .",
    "second , it is expected that there is critical / threshold metallicity for efficient dust formation rather than a linear rise as above .",
    "thus , a more realistic scenario is that in which stellar dust production becomes efficient at a certain metallicity , i.e. , there is a smooth ` jump ' in @xmath67 at some metallicity @xmath130 .",
    "the transition from inefficient to efficient dust condensation is likely smooth , so it would be reasonable to adopt something of the form ( see fig .",
    "[ dustyield ] ) @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the minimum dust yield for inefficient dust condensation and @xmath133 is the maximum dust yield obtained at high efficiency .",
    "thus , we obtain the solution [ with initial condition @xmath134 @xmath135\\ ] ] where we have defined the so - called exponential integral @xmath136 as @xmath137 if the initial metallicity @xmath138 is very small , or , more precisely , if @xmath139 , we can simplify the above expression into @xmath140",
    "below we consider the dust - to - metals trends derived from optical depth , extinction magnitude and depletion levels of certain metals and compare them with the simplistic models described in the previous section .",
    "furthermore , we present simple monte carlo simulations to demonstrate how such simple scenario would appear when allowing the model parameters to vary within a certain parameter space .      due to the approximate proportionality between @xmath12 and the dust - to - gas ratio one would expect the @xmath1-band optical depth @xmath3 to be a simple function of dust density .",
    "more precisely , @xmath141 . given the result by @xcite , the dust mass density @xmath7 is then simply proportional to the stellar mass density @xmath142 .",
    "theoretically , this proportionality is expected for all unevovled ( gas - rich ) galaxies ( see section [ purestellar ] ) . but for it to hold also for more evolved galaxies , a balance between growth and destruction of dust in the ism is necessary .    the trend obtained by @xcite is fundamentally an empirical result , and consistent with a simple model where dust is produced by stars .",
    "nevertheless , the nearly linear @xmath143 is not answering the question whether dust is formed mainly in stars or grown in the ism ( growth and destruction can conspire to produce a @xmath78 relation ) , but seems to favour models with significant stellar dust production .",
    "the linear relation discussed above may suggest the dust - to - metals ratio is not showing large variations since the metal content of a galaxy is typically correlated with the stellar mass ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , but there is still plenty of room for scatter and the relation is derived for local spiral galaxies which may be in similar evolutionary states where the dust - to - metals ratio has reached an ` equilibrium plateau ' . a more diverse sample of objects would therefore provide a more useful statistical constraint .      we have transformed the dust - to - metals ratios in @xcite from observational units to unit less ratios + \\log(a_v)$ ] , where @xmath144 is the column density of neutral hydrogen and [ x / h ] is the abundance of x relative to the corresponding solar value , we adopted the galactic value @xmath145 @xcite . the unit less dust - to - metals ratio is obtained as @xmath146}$ ] , where @xmath147 . here , we adopt @xmath148 to maintain consistency between the data sets .",
    "but the exact value is not very important as long as the adopted value is the same for all data sets considered . ] ( as in the models discussed in previous sections ) for those objects where all relevant quantities have been measured with sufficient accuracy ( see fig .",
    "the relatively small variation of the dust - to - metals ratio ( @xmath149 ) seen over such a wide range of redshifts and metallicities ( and likely also galaxy types ) in the work by @xcite is a relatively strong constraint on the dust formation scenario , provided it can be trusted despite the rather small number of reliable measurements . a dust - to - metals ratio @xmath150 would correspond to @xmath151 in an ` equilibrium model ' where @xmath152 ( see section [ gdequil ] ) .",
    "as shown by the different models ( analytic solutions to eq .",
    "[ dtm ] ) over - plotted in fig .",
    "[ av ] , variation of the yield ratio @xmath119 leads to a wide range of dust - to - metals ratios at low metallicity , but converges to the asymptotic value , which is @xmath153 for the special case @xmath154 .",
    "the @xmath6 scatter in the @xcite data suggest @xmath60 can vary at most about 30% , but it should be noted the observed values cover a range @xmath155 , which indicates significant variations of @xmath60 can not be ruled out due to small - number statistics .",
    "the growth / destruction - equilibrium model suggested in section [ gdequil ] is attractive as it would explain the existence of a characteristic , essentially universal , dust - to - metals ratio @xmath60 , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "deviations from this ` universal ' value could then be attributed to variations of the yield ratio @xmath119 . as we have mentioned in section [ z - dependence ]",
    ", there could exist a critical metallicity ( or , more precisely , number density of certain key elements ) in stars below which dust condensation is inefficient .",
    "however , it could also be that @xmath119 is a ` universal constant ' and that the limited variance in @xmath60 could be explained by the fact that the growth and destruction parameters , @xmath31 and @xmath108 , respectively , can vary between different environments . realistically , none of these parameters ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath31 , @xmath108 ) should be viewed as ` universal constants ' , of course .",

    "but as we have already discussed , the growth / destruction - equilibrium model with @xmath103 has an asymptotic dust - to - metals ratio @xmath156 which is eventually reached regardless of what @xmath60 is at early times .",
    "but if @xmath60 shows a clear trend with metallicity , as in the results by @xcite , there can not just be random variations of the yield ratio @xmath119 .",
    "@xcite , as well as , e.g. , @xcite , find a @xmath60 increasing with metallicity , which is what one would expect in a scenario where the bulk of cosmic dust is grown in the ism rather than produced directly by stars .",
    "however , according to our simplistic model with a constant @xmath67 , the expected trend without growth / destruction - equilibrium is a _ steep _ rise in @xmath60 at some critical metallicity ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is not in agreement with the observed trend ( see fig .",
    "[ dep ] , models with @xmath157 ) .",
    "the observed slower rise of the dust - to - metals ratio can thus be a result of a changing yield ratio .",

    "ultimately , this shows that we need to modify our model - a constant yield ratio @xmath119 fails to reproduce the trend .    the blue line in fig .",

    "( [ smooth ] ) with the parameter values plotted in fig .",

    ", there is always a @xmath158 that will lead to a constant dust - to - metals ratio @xmath60 for any given @xmath161 .",
    "we suggest this could be a good compromise in order to obtain a model that can explain why @xmath60 in some cases show very little variation and in other cases a trend with metallicity .",
    "the case where interstellar dust processing has no effect on the dust mass fraction of the ism ( @xmath121 or @xmath122 ) is indicated by the dotted black line in fig .",
    "[ dep ] ( corresponding to eq .",
    "[ z - dep - analytic ] ) .",
    "the effect of interstellar grain growth is the difference between the solid blue and dotted black lines , where the critical metallicity ( the point where the lines diverge ) occurs at @xmath162 .",
    "the most likely cause for a changing effective dust yield @xmath67 is the existence of a critical metallicity below which dust formation is significantly less efficient compared to the efficiency at higher metallicities .",
    "as we have already mentioned , a lower number density of key - elements for dust condensation may be important in stars that do not produce much of these key - elements themselves .",
    "but for most massive stars that undergo a core - collapse supernova explosion the amount of metals produced is significant even at @xmath104 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". however , gas opacities and cooling rates may be lower at very low metallicities , which in turn may affect the heating and cooling of existing dust grains .",
    "if the average grain temperature is high enough for sublimation to occur , the net efficiency of condensation may be low .",
    "thus , it is not clear that very metal - poor stars can be efficient dust producers even if raw material for dust formation is present .",
    "asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars are probably not very important dust producers at low metallicity according to recent work in which a steep dependence on metallicty is found @xcite . in addition , at really low metallicity of the interstellar gas , i.e. , at very early times , low- and intermediate - mass stars have not had enough time to evolve into agb stars either .",
    "for example , metal - poor halo stars in the galaxy appear to have been formed from gas that is mainly enriched by massive stars ( supernovae with progenitor masses typically in the range @xmath163 ) , although variations in the abundance patterns sometimes occur @xcite .",
    "moreover , the destruction of dust in sne is likely more efficient the more massive the progenitor star is ( and the degree of dust condensation is likely lower ) , which means that a bias towards more massive stars at low metallicity may also lead to less stellar dust per unit stellar mass .",
    "numerical models of sn dust production do indeed confirm that the most massive stars have less surviving dust in their ejecta @xcite . to summarise the above : _ oxygen - rich agb stars ( the more massive and short - lived ones )",
    "can not produce very much dust at low metallicity since they do not produce the refractory elements needed for dust production , and the effective dust yield of massive stars is probably strongly metallicity dependent too_. thus , a @xmath158 increasing with metallicity seems reasonable .",
    "the reason why the grb and qso - dlas studied by @xcite , as well as local galaxies , show so little variation in their dust - to - metal ratios ( despite a wide range of metallicities ) is still not obvious . but provided the effective dust yield @xmath67 depends on the metallicity , this invariant ratio as well as the rising trend found in quasar dlas by measuring depletions @xcite could be ` two sides of the same coin ' .",
    "statistical variations in the overall efficiencies of grain growth and destruction in the ism , combined with some uncertainty in which metallicity @xmath130 stellar dust production starts to become efficient , will allow for enough scatter in the dust - to - metals ratio as a function of metallicity to have one fundamental model which is consistent with both the flat and the rising trend .",
    "this will be explored in the next section . as an alternative hypothesis",
    ", one may consider the possibility that the @xmath12-based dust abundance estimates in @xcite are biased towards environments which have , relatively speaking , significant foreground contamination from intervening systems and therefore appear to have higher dust - to - metals ratios at low metallicity .",
    "this possibility should of course be investigated , but goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    ".[parameters ] random variables / parameters used for the monte carlo models . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we expect variations in not only the effective dust yield @xmath67 , but also in the timescales of grain growth and destruction ( @xmath31 and @xmath41 , in practice ) . to quantify the effects of such variations , to some extent",
    ", we have performed a couple of monte carlo simulations where we vary the parameters @xmath108 and @xmath31 within reasonable ranges as well as setting them to zero ( see table [ parameters ] ) .",
    "the yield ratio @xmath119 is not completely arbitrary either .",
    "on the one hand , the fraction of metals being injected into the ism in the form of dust grains can not be 100% , since the degree of dust condensation must be limited by the physical conditions and the abundances of certain key elements ( e.g. , carbon or silicon ) in the dust chemistry . on the other hand , this fraction can not be too small either , since it is an observational fact that low- and intermediate - mass stars as well as massive stars in the local universe produce significant amounts of dust .",
    "the fraction of dust that actually survive and eventually enrich the ism is not known , but with the observed trend shown in fig .",
    "[ dep ] as reference we have calibrated the range of the effective yield ratio @xmath119 to approximately @xmath164 .",
    "thus , two of the parameters of eq .",
    "( [ smooth ] ) are fixed : @xmath165 and @xmath166 , while @xmath130 remains as a random variable of the monte carlo simulation together with @xmath108 and @xmath31 .    in fig .",
    "[ dtm_mc ] we have plotted the resultant probability density functions ( pdf ) of our simulation results . to begin with , we performed a monte carlo simulation of the case of stellar dust production only , with the yield ratio @xmath119 ( @xmath67 not metallicity dependent ) and the metallicity @xmath25 as the only random variables .",
    "for this simulation we assumed that @xmath119 follows a normal distribution with standard deviation @xmath167 , centred at @xmath168 ( model a in table [ parameters ] ) .",
    "the resultant pdf is consistent with data from @xcite , as can be seen in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ dtm_mc ] . after establishing this ` bench mark ' , we then considered the case of a metallicity dependent dust yield according to eq .",
    "( [ smooth ] ) with the parameter values given above and @xmath169 .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath108 ranges are difficult to define , but as we argued in section [ destruction ] , @xmath59 ( @xmath170 ) is a reasonable estimate of the expected range for @xmath41 . under the assumption @xmath99",
    ", we may then assume @xmath171 ( see model b in table [ parameters ] ) .",
    "all random variables were in this case assumed to follow uniform distributions .",
    "as we showed in section [ gdequil ] , the dust - to - metals ratio converges to @xmath153 if @xmath103 , regardless of the value of @xmath119 or whether @xmath67 is metallicity dependent or not .",
    "clearly , this is the reason why the scatter in @xmath60 becomes smaller at high metallicity when interstellar grain growth and destruction is included , compared to the case where @xmath120 in which the scatter is the same regardless of metallicity ( cf . left and right panels in fig .",
    "[ dtm_mc ] ) .",
    "this inherent property of the model suggests one could , in principle , use the amount of scatter at approximately solar metallicity to constrain the width of the range of likely @xmath31 and @xmath108 values .",
    "the observational data suggest a relatively small scatter ( see figs .",
    "[ av ] and [ dep ] ) , albeit with large error bars on some data points .",
    "the parameter ranges that we have used in our simple monte carlo simulation appears to give a result that is consistent with the spread and uncertainty of the data at solar - like metallicities . of course",
    ", one can not draw very firm conclusions from a simplistic simulation like the present , but it seems that models which include interstellar grain growth and destruction is favoured by the fact that there appears to be significantly more scatter among the data points at low ( @xmath172 of solar ) metallicity than near solar metallicity .",
    "we therefore think our growth / destruction equilibrium model is plausible and may provide guidance towards a more consistent picture of the of the origin and evolution of cosmic dust .",
    "several observational studies suggest a surprisingly small variation of the dust - to - metals ratio in vastly different environments .",
    "it is worth stressing that the ` trivial solution ' to the problem , i.e. , adopting a ( constant ) yield ratio of @xmath173 , works for any model where there is a replenishment mechanism to counteract possible dust destruction ( such as the model used by * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "but other observational evidence also suggest there is a significant variation of the dust - to - metals ratio between different environments , and an invariant dust - to - metals ratio is problematic also in the sense that it requires fine - tuning and is pushing the limits of the ` standard models ' of dust evolution in galaxies to explain all data @xcite .",
    "we find that a reasonable way to resolve this apparent contradiction , and avoiding fine - tuning and extreme model parameters , is to assume that stellar dust production can be efficient , but that interstellar dust growth is equally important and act as a replenishment mechanism which can almost exactly counteract the dust destruction in the ism . in this scenario ,",
    "the ratio of the effective ( stellar ) dust and metal yields is not likely a universal constant and may change due to some metallicity - dependence of the stellar dust yield .",
    "we propose the existence of a critical stellar metallicity above which nucleation and condensation of dust in stars can be efficient .",
    "we conclude that destruction and growth of grains in the ism likely strives towards an equilibrium state , which mimics the general behaviour of the case of pure stellar dust production ( and no destruction of grains ) .",
    "this explains the relatively small variation of the dust - to - metals ratio seen in several observational studies of local galaxies , but allows also for a significantly lower ratio at low metallicity if the effective stellar dust yield can vary with metallicity .",
    "the suggested scenario has important implications for the rapid build - up of large dust masses at high redshifts . instead of requiring an extreme efficiency of dust formation in massive stars ( sne ) as suggested by , e.g. , @xcite ,",
    "the large dust masses seen in the quasar - host galaxy sdss j1148 + 5251 ( and other objects at high redshifts ) , follows naturally from the rapid production of metals that is expected in a massive starburst . just as @xcite we are led to conclude that , though massive stars must produce significant amounts of dust , dust masses of the order @xmath174 ( as in sdss j1148 + 5251 ) are not likely a result of stellar dust sources only ( as a consequence of interstellar dust destruction ) and the resultant dust component",
    "must therefore be dominated by grain growth in molecular clouds .",
