    "in the field of numerical integration , methods specially tuned on oscillating functions , are of great practical importance .",
    "such methods are needed in various branches of natural sciences , particularly in physics , since a lot of physical phenomena exhibit a pronounced oscillatory behaviour . for a review of such methods see @xcite and references there in as well as the book @xcite .    for problems having highly oscillatory solutions , standard methods with unspecialized use can require a huge number of steps to track the oscillations .",
    "one way to obtain a more efficient integration process is to construct numerical methods with an increased algebraic order , although the simple implementation of high algebraic order methods may cause several problems ( for example , the existence of parasitic solutions @xcite ) . on the other hand , there are some special techniques for optimizing numerical methods .",
    "trigonometrical fitting and phase - fitting are some of them , producing methods with variable coefficients , which depend on @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the dominant frequency of the problem and @xmath4 is the step length of integration .",
    "this technique is known as exponential ( or trigonometric if @xmath5 ) fitting and has a long history @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an important property of exponential fitted algorithms is that they tend to the classical ones when the involved frequencies tend to zero , a fact which allows to say that exponential fitting represents a natural extension of the classical polynomial fitting .",
    "the examination of the convergence of exponential fitted multistep methods is included in lyche s theory @xcite .",
    "the general theory is presented in detail in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , considering the accuracy of a method when solving oscillatory problems , it is more appropriate to work with the phase - lag , rather than its usual primary local truncation error .",
    "we mention the pioneering paper of brusa and nigro @xcite , in which the phase - lag property was introduced .",
    "this is actually another type of a truncation error , i.e. the angle between the analytical solution and the numerical solution .",
    "a significant application of the phase or exponential fitting is on the construction of symplectic methods for oscillatory problems encountered in physics and chemistry ( @xcite ) .",
    "although phase fitting and exponential fitting are a major improvement over algebraic fitted methods especially for oscillatory and orbital problems , there is not significant evidence from published results that these methods can be applied for long term integration ( for example for millions or billions of periods ) .",
    "moreover , several authors use to test their methods to the well known 2-body problem but only for relatively low eccentricities ( up to @xmath6 ) and for relatively small number of periods ( no more than several thousands ) .",
    "we mention here the efforts of @xcite in which there is no evidence that the phase fitting or trigonometric fitting can be applied to high eccentricities ( for example to the halley comet with eccentricity close to @xmath7 ) and for long time .",
    "another approach to oscillatory and especially hamiltonian systems is the theory of discrete variational mechanics , which was set up in the 1960s @xcite and then it was proposed in the optimal control literature .",
    "it then motivated a lot of authors and soon the discrete euler - lagrange equations were formulated and the first integrators in the discrete calculus of variation and further the multi - freedom and higher - order problems were studied .",
    "afterwards , the canonical structure and symmetries for discrete systems were obtained , and noether s theorem to the discrete case was extended @xcite .",
    "finally , the time as a discrete dynamical variable was regarded @xcite . a detailed description of the essential properties of variational integrators can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the most important properties of variational integrators is that since the discrete lagrangian is an approximation of a continuous lagrangian function , the obtained numerical integrator inherits some of the geometric properties of the continuous lagrangian ( such as symplecticity , momentum preservation ) .    in the present work ,",
    "the benefits of the two approach are combined in order to construct high order discrete lagrangian integrators with phase fitting . to obtain this ,",
    "we have adopted a test lagrangian problem ( similar to the test ode in the phase fitting ) which is the harmonic oscillator with given frequency @xmath3 .",
    "then , we construct discrete variational schemes that solve exactly the test lagrangian .",
    "the application of the method to a general lagrangian needs the determination of the frequency @xmath3 at every step of the integration .",
    "the method is applied to the 2-body problem with eccentricity up to @xmath0 for @xmath1 periods and to henon - heiles system which for high energies exhibit chaotic behaviour .",
    "the results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of the new approach .",
    "the well known least action principle of the continuous lagrange - hamilton dynamics can be used as a guiding principle to derive discrete integrators . following the steps of the derivation of euler - lagrange equations in the continuous time lagrangian dynamics",
    ", one can derive the discrete time euler - lagrange equations .",
    "for this purpose , one considers positions @xmath8 and @xmath9 and a time step @xmath10 , in order to replace the parameters of position @xmath11 and velocity @xmath12 in the continuous time lagrangian @xmath13 .",
    "then , by considering the variable @xmath4 as a very small ( positive ) number , the positions @xmath8 and @xmath9 could be thought of as being two points on a curve ( trajectory of the mechanical system ) at time @xmath4 apart . under these assumptions ,",
    "the following approximations hold : @xmath14 and a function @xmath15 could be defined known as a discrete lagrangian function .",
    "many authors assume such functions to approximate the action integral along the curve segment between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath16 furthermore , one may consider the very simple approximation for this integral given on the basis of the rectangle rule described in @xcite . according to this rule , the integral @xmath17 could be approximated by the product of the time - interval @xmath18 times the value of the integrand @xmath19 obtained with the velocity @xmath12 replaced by the approximation @xmath20 : the next step is to consider a discrete curve defined by the set of points @xmath21 , and calculate the discrete action along this sequence by summing the discrete lagrangian of the form @xmath22 defined for each adjacent pair of points @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "following the case of the continuous dynamics , we compute variations of this action sum with the boundary points @xmath8 and @xmath25 held fixed .",
    "briefly , discretization of the action functional leads to the concept of an action sum @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an approximation of l called the discrete lagrangian .",
    "hence , in the discrete setting the correspondence to the velocity phase space @xmath28 is @xmath29 .",
    "an intuitive motivation for this is that two points close to each other correspond approximately to the same information as one point and a velocity vector .",
    "the discrete hamilton s principle states that if @xmath30 is a motion of the discrete mechanical system then it extremizes the action sum , i. e. , @xmath31 . by differentiation and rearranging of the terms and having in mind that both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are fixed , the discrete euler - lagrange ( del ) equation is obtained : @xmath34 where the notation @xmath35 indicates the slot derivative with respect to the argument of @xmath36 .",
    "we can define now the map @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the space of generalized positions @xmath11 , by which @xmath39 which means that @xmath40 . then",
    ", if for each @xmath41 , the map @xmath42 is invertible , then @xmath43 is locally invertible and so the discrete flow defined by the map @xmath44 is well defined for small enough time steps ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "moreover , if we define the fiber derivative @xmath45 and the two - form @xmath3 on @xmath46 by pulling back the canonical two - form @xmath47 from @xmath48 to @xmath46 : @xmath49 the coordinate expression for @xmath3 is @xmath50 and can be easily proved that the map @xmath44 preserves the symplectic form @xmath3 ( two different proofs are presented in @xcite and @xcite ) . finally , assuming that the discrete lagrangian is invariant under the action of a lie group @xmath51 on @xmath38 and @xmath52 , the lie algebra of @xmath51 , by analogy with the continuous case",
    ", we can define the discrete momentum map @xmath53 by @xmath54 it can be proved that the map @xmath44 preserves the momentum map @xmath55 @xcite .    in a position - momentum form",
    "the discrete euler - lagrange equations ( [ equ_del ] ) can be defined by the equations below @xmath56",
    "summarizing the phase fitting technique , we consider for simplicity only first order differential equations , although the same results can be easily obtained for second order equations too .",
    "consider the test problem @xmath57 with exact solution @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a non - negative real value .",
    "let @xmath60 be a numerical map which when it is applied to a set of known past values , it produces a numerical estimation of @xmath61 .",
    "if we assume that all past values are known exactly , then the numerical estimation @xmath62 of @xmath61 will be @xmath63 while the exact solution is @xmath64 .",
    "then the ratio of the estimated to the exact solution is @xmath65 in the above equation ( [ equ_def_pl ] ) , the term @xmath66 is called the _ amplification error _ , while the term @xmath67 is called the _ phase lag _ of the numerical map . in the case",
    "that @xmath68 and @xmath69 , we say that the numerical map @xmath70 is _ exponentially fitted _ at the frequency @xmath59 and at the step size @xmath4 .",
    "the technique of phase fitting can now be considered as the vanishing or minimization of the phase lag .",
    "consider now the discrete lagrangian @xmath71 ( @xmath72 corresponds to time @xmath73 and @xmath74 to time @xmath75 ) and a set of @xmath76 intermediate points @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "the role of the number of intermidiate points will be discussed later . assuming that @xmath79 and @xmath80 we always have @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "then we can approximate @xmath83 with the quadrature @xmath84 for maximal algebraic order it is easily proved that the following conditions must hold : @xmath85 then , we can approximate intermediate points and their derivatives with @xmath86 consider now the test lagrangian ( harmonic oscillator ) similar to the test equation ( [ equ_test_equ ] ) @xmath87 then , applying the above assumptions in eq .",
    "( [ equ_del ] ) we get @xmath88 where @xmath89 . since the exact solution of eq .",
    "( [ equ_ltest ] ) is @xmath90 and we want to force our method to solve exactly eq .",
    "( [ equ_del ] ) , we get @xmath91    the role of intermediate points will be clarified now by introducing corrections at the these points",
    ". let @xmath92 a set of parameters and rewrite eq .",
    "( [ equ_inter ] ) as @xmath93 where the @xmath94 is the interpolating polynomial of the set of points @xmath95 and @xmath96 its time derivative .",
    "thus , @xmath97 can be considered as corrections to points @xmath98 ( the correction at @xmath99 is zero since we have assumed that @xmath81 ) .",
    "the set of equations ( [ equ_dhp ] ) are now rewritten as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the lagrange multiplier and can be easily proved that it is equal to @xmath102 . this technique is similar to those described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in order to efficiently evaluate the frequency of the problem , we focus on orbital problems and especially on the eccentricity . in general , an elliptic orbit may be parameterized as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the position at time @xmath105 and @xmath106 is a function of time .",
    "then @xmath107 where the product @xmath108 is equal to the product of the square of the semi - major axis @xmath109 , multiplied by @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the eccentricity .",
    "since the frequency locally can be approximated by @xmath112 we get @xmath113 notice here that both @xmath109 and @xmath111 can be calculated by the position and velocity of the moving object ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we now turn to the study of two objects interacting through a central force .",
    "the most famous example of this type , is the kepler problem ( also called the two - body problem ) that describes the motion of two bodies which attract each other . in the solar system",
    "the gravitational interaction between two bodies leads to the elliptic orbits of planets and the hyperbolic orbits of comets .",
    "if we choose one of the bodies as the center of our coordinate system , the motion will stay in a plane . denoting the position of the second body by @xmath114 , the lagrangian of the system takes the form ( assuming masses and gravitational constant equal to 1 ) @xmath115 the initial conditions are taken @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the eccentricity of the orbit . in order to check the efficiency of the proposed algorithm",
    ", we shall consider only high eccentricities ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "in the first test , we count the number of integration steps needed for one period and for eccentricity equal to @xmath119 . the results are summarized in table [ table_res1 ] .",
    ".number of integration steps [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table_res2 ]",
    "it has been shown in this work , that the technique of phase fitting , when it is embedded in discrete lagrangian integrators , improves the accuracy and the efficiency of the numerical method . following the classical application of the phase fitting technique ,",
    "the discrete lagrangian integrator is forced to solve exactly the test lagrangian of harmonic oscillator with a given self frequency .",
    "the coefficients of the resulting integrator , depend on the frequency of the problem at each integration step . in order to improve the accuracy of the method , a set of intermediate points",
    "were added as corrections to the trigonometric path .",
    "the results show that the method can be used for long term integrations of planetary motions and this was demonstrated by applying the method to very high eccentricities ( @xmath0 ) and for milions of periods .",
