    "a topological defect at the 11th resonator is introduced by repeating the spacing @xmath8 . on the left hand side of the array , close to the first resonator",
    ", we have placed a kink antenna that emits a signal .",
    "the structure is shielded from above with a metallic plate ( not shown ) where a movable loop antenna ( receiving antenna ) is mounted and it is coupled to the 13th resonator . a photograph of the experimental set - up is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) .",
    "next we assume that the defect resonator incorporates a nonlinear absorption mechanism , i.e.  we assume that its losses are self - regulated depending on the strength of the incident field radiation .",
    "one option to incorporate nonlinear losses is via an external element ( fast diodes ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) .",
    "it provides `` on - the - fly '' re - configurability of the lt via an externally tuned dc voltage @xmath9 . the magnetic field , due to the transmitted signal , at the defect resonator",
    "is coupled to the diodes via a loop antenna .",
    "its strength dictates the value of the induced current at the antenna and consequently the voltage across the diodes .",
    "the latter dictates if the diodes are `` on '' ( high voltage corresponding to high losses at the defect resonator ) or `` off '' ( low voltage corresponding to low losses ) .",
    "an alternative nonlinear lossy mechanism is associated with temperature driven insulator - to - metal phase transition materials like vanadium dioxide ( vo@xmath10 ) @xcite , which can be deposited on top of the defect resonator [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](c ) ] .    in our experiment",
    "we are not concerned with the physical origin of the nonlinear losses at the defect resonator .",
    "rather we focus on demonstrating their effects on the transport properties of the photonic structure and thus establishing the operational principle of ( structurally ) robust reflective photonic limiters with wide dynamical range .",
    "therefore , we have included losses by placing an absorbing patch on top of the resonator [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1](d ) ] .",
    "this process results in a slight shift of the real part of the permittivity of the defect resonator , which we corrected by using resonators with slightly higher eigenfrequency .",
    "the linewidth @xmath11 has been used in order to quantify the losses , of the resonators . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](e ) we show the transmittance @xmath12 , reflectance @xmath13 , and absorption @xmath14 for two resonators with different losses .",
    "the transmittance @xmath12 , is measured from the kink antenna to the loop antenna , which was positioned above the resonator .",
    "the reflectance @xmath13 , is measured from the kink antenna .",
    "we observe that the stand - alone lossy resonator reduces the transmittance @xmath12 as the losses increases , thus acting as a limiter .",
    "however this reduction in @xmath12 comes to the expense of increasing absorption , i.e.  the stand - alone lossy resonator acts as a sacrificial limiter .",
    "the photonic structure is described by a one - dimensional ( 1d ) tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath15 where @xmath16 enumerates the resonators , @xmath17 is the resonance frequency of the @xmath18th individual resonator and @xmath19 is the coupling between nearest resonators . the band - structure of the system of eq .",

    "a topologically protected localised defect mode is created in the middle of the band at @xmath24 @xcite . the mode is exponentially localised at the defect resonator .",
    "its shape , in the limit of infinite many resonators , is @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the amplitude of the defect mode at the @xmath18th resonator and @xmath27 is the so - called localisation length of the mode @xcite .",
    "the staggering form of the defect state is a direct consequence of the chiral ( sublattice ) symmetry .",
    "the chiral symmetry provides a topological protection of the defect mode to structural imperfections and at the same time shields the position of the resonant mode in the middle of the band - gap for reasonable variations of @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "when the system is coupled to the antennas at the resonators @xmath30 ( emitting antenna ) and @xmath31 ( receiving antenna ) , the localised defect mode becomes quasi - localised resonant mode at frequency @xmath32 , with a large but finite lifetime @xmath33 ( details see method section ) .",

    "measurements of the widths of the mini - bands and of the gap allow us to extract the couplings @xmath6mhz , @xmath7mhz .",

    "the small peak in the absorption ( solid line in fig .",

    "[ fig : fig2](c ) . in other words ,",
    "our photonic structure becomes _ reflective _ ( not absorptive ) as the losses of the defect resonator increases .",
    "this behavior is in distinct contrast to the case of a single ( sacrificial ) lossy resonator [ see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] . we find that an increase of @xmath45 leads to a decrease of resonant transmittance @xmath12 and absorption @xmath53 of the photonic structure .",
    "this behaviour is contrasted with the measurements ( diamonds ) and numerical calculations ( dashed lines ) of a stand - alone lossy resonator . in the latter case",
    "we observe relatively large @xmath12 values @xmath54 as opposed to @xmath55 for the photonic structure , i.e.  ultralow lt .",
    "for moderate @xmath45-values the absorption of the stand - alone resonator reaches large values @xmath56 corresponding to low ldt .",
    "in contrast , the crow structure takes absorption values , which are at least one order of magnitude smaller ( high ldt ) . at the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , we report the numerical results for @xmath51 , @xmath52 for an ideal crow structure with @xmath50 ( dashed lines ) and one lossy defect resonator with @xmath45 placed in the middle of the array . again",
    ", we compare these results to the theoretical / experimental ( lines / diamonds ) results for the stand - alone lossy resonator with linewidth @xmath45 .",
    "both cases show the same qualitative behavior .",
    "however , the photonic structure shows a two - order lower lt ( i.e.  smaller @xmath45-value for which the decay of transmittance occurs ) as compared to a stand - alone resonator . at the same time",
    "the ldt of the photonic structure is at least two orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding one associated with the stand - alone resonator .",
    "specifically the latter case acquires a maximum value of absorption @xmath57 at @xmath58 as opposed to @xmath59 acquired by the photonic structure .",
    "we point that the maximum in absorption for the photonic structure occurs at much lower values of @xmath60 which in the case of a non - linear lossy mechanism correspond to rather small , and therefore harmless , incident radiation power / energy .    the fragility of the resonant localised mode at moderate @xmath45-values is further analysed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) we report the numerical resonant defect fields for a lossless resonator array ( i.e.  @xmath50 ) and for various @xmath45-values . for @xmath61 , a nice agreement between the numerics and eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq2 ] ) is observed , indicating that the coupling to the antennas does not affect the resonant mode profile .",
    "as the loss @xmath45 at the defect resonator increases from zero , a gradual deviation from the profile of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq2 ] ) occurs and eventually a suppression of the defect localized mode is observed . indeed , for @xmath62mhz the exponential decay of the field intensity from the incident side of the waveguide [ see blue line in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4](a ) ] indicates the destruction of the resonant localized mode [ see filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) ] .",
    "_ thus the lossy defect resonator is protected from damages induced by heat or electrical breakdown .",
    "_ for the photonic limiter of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] it implies a huge increase in its dynamic range .",
    "the comparison with the experimental data [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4](b ) ] associated with the crow array of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows that the underlying mechanism which is responsible for the destruction of the resonant defect mode remains unaffected , even when small global losses are present ( @xmath3mhz ) .",
    "the destruction of the resonant defect mode can be understood intuitively as a result of a competition between two mechanisms that control the dwell time of the photon in the resonant state .",
    "the first one is associated with the boundary losses due to the coupling of the photonic structure to the antennas .",
    "it results to a resonant linewidth @xmath63 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq4 ] ) .",
    "the other mechanism is associated with bulk losses and it leads to an additional broadening of the resonance linewidth . using first order perturbation theory we get @xmath64    for small values of @xmath45 such that @xmath65 , the dwell time is determined by @xmath66 and it is essentially constant .",
    "thus the absorption of the photons that populate the resonant state increases , as they are trapped for relatively long time in the lossy crow array [ see the peak of the black line in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2](c ) ] . when @xmath67 , the dwell time itself begins to diminish , and the resonant mode is spoiled .",
    "for even larger values of @xmath45 the photons do not dwell at all in the resonant state and reflection from the whole structure becomes the dominant mechanism . as a result , the absorption decreases to zero .",
    "the above argumentation applies equally well for the stand - alone defect and for the photonic structure .",
    "however , in the latter case the condition for the destruction of the resonant mode @xmath68 is achieved for _ exponentially _ smaller values of @xmath45 .",
    "it is exactly this effect that our proposal is harvesting in order to increase the damaging threshold ( and consequently the dynamic range ) of the photonic waveguide limiter .",
    "we have investigated experimentally the transport properties of a coupled microwave resonator array with a lossy defect in the presence of chiral symmetry .",
    "we have shown that when the losses at the defect resonator are small , a topologically protected midgap defect mode provides high transmittance . when the losses increase , the defect mode and the associated resonant transmission are suppressed .",
    "we find that the incident energy is not absorbed - despite the fact that the defect losses are increased .",
    "rather the incident radiation is reflected back to space .",
    "such mechanism , coupled with non - linear losses at the defect resonator , can be harvested for the realisation of a new class of microwave waveguide limiters with a wide dynamical range .",
    "the authors acknowledge partial support from onr via grant n00014 - 16 - 1 - 2803 and from afosr ( lrir14ry14cor and fa9550 - 14 - 1 - 0037 ) .",
    "the stay of ( t.k . ) at lpmc - cnrs was supported by cnrs .",
    "the transmission and reflection measurements are performed on the one hand - side with a kink antenna , which couples to the in - plane electric field , and on the other hand side with the loop antenna , which couples to the magnetic field which is oriented out - of - plane .",
    "the excited resonance of the resonators corresponds to the first resonance of the te@xmath69 mode , i.e.  the magnetic field is out - of - plane and maximal in the center and the electric field is in - plane and maximal at the boundaries of the resonators .",
    "thus the two antenna types are ideally suited to perform the experiment . to obtain the natural line width of the resonators ,",
    "i.e.  without the linewidth acquired by the antenna coupling , we measured the resonance linewidth as a function of the distance between antenna and resonator and extrapolated the natural linewidth .",
    "the photonic structure is coupled to the antennas at the @xmath30 resonator and at the @xmath31 resonator by a transmitting and a receiving antenna , respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "we are modelling the two antennas by a one - dimensional semi - infinite tight - binding lattice with coupling constant @xmath70 and on - site energies @xmath71 .",
    "the associated scattering matrix can be written in the following form @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the @xmath74 identity matrix , @xmath75 is a @xmath76 matrix that describes the coupling between the photonic structure and the antennas , @xmath77 is the frequency of propagating waves at the antennas and @xmath78 is their associated wavevector . finally @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the coupling constant of the transmitting and the receiving antennas , respectively . due to the coupling to the antennas ,",
    "the localised defect mode becomes quasi - localised resonant mode at frequency @xmath32 , with a large but finite lifetime @xmath33 .",
    "one can estimate ( to first order in perturbation theory ) the inverse lifetime of such mode @xmath81 where @xmath35 are its @xmath36 and @xmath37 components , see eq .",
