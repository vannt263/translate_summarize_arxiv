    "the realization of quantum devices with photon - photon interaction has become an interesting and important research topic in quantum optics and quantum technologies .",
    "the key element to obtain the mentioned interactions is strong optical nonlinearity that gives rise to many important quantum effects at level of few - photons , including photon blockade@xcite .    in the photon blockade ( pb )",
    "the optical response to a single photon is modulated by the presence or absence of the other photons .",
    "particularly , the capture of a single photon into the system affects the probability that a second photon is admitted .",
    "thus , the photon blockade is the analog of the coulomb blockade for electrons in condensed matter devices , where single electron transport is blocked by a strong coulomb interaction in a confined structure .",
    "a simple consequence of photon blockade is the antibunching of photons in emission in analogy to the photon antibunching of resonance fluorescence on a two - level atom @xcite .",
    "one of the basic conditions for pb is that the photon - photon interaction strength should be larger regarding decay rate of the system . in this respect ,",
    "strong nonlinearities on the few - photon level can be produced by interaction between photons and an atom in a cavity @xcite , in systems with interacting photons or polaritons in arrays of cavities coupled to atoms or qubits @xcite , in optomechanical systems and kerr type nonlinear cavities @xcite .",
    "photon blockade was first observed in an optical cavity coupled to a single trapped atom @xcite .",
    "the pb has been predicted in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite , and recently in circuit qed with a single superconducting artificial atom coupled to a microwave transmission line resonator @xcite .",
    "pb was also experimentally demonstrated with a photonic crystal cavity with a strongly coupled quantum dot @xcite , and was also predicted in quantum optomechanical systems @xcite .",
    "an analogous phenomenon of phonon blockade was predicted for an artificial superconducting atom coupled to a nanomechanical resonator @xcite , as well as the polariton blockade effect due to polariton - polariton interactions has been considered in @xcite .",
    "recently , pb was considered in dispersive qubit - field interactions in a superconductive coplanar waveguide cavity @xcite and with time - modulated input @xcite .    in",
    "most of the cited works pb was considered in nonlinear optical systems driven by a continuous - wave laser . however , photon sources on demand require production of photon pulses at fixed time - intervals . in this paper",
    ", we investigate pb in the pulsed regime , considering kerr - type oscillatory dissipative system driven by a sequence of classical gaussian pulses separated by time intervals .",
    "this approach allows to expand the mechanism of pb for the case of producing few - photon pulses at deterministic time intervals .",
    "thus , we present comparative analysis of one - photon , two - photon and three - photon blockades in the pulsed regimes in addition to the results obtained for the case of pb in cw driving field @xcite .    in this way , we demonstrate , that contrarily to common expectations , the results obtained in the pulsed regime considerably differ from those derived for the monochromatic driving @xcite .",
    "more importantly , we see that pb in kerr - type systems under pulsed excitation can be controlled by shape of pulses . in this spirit",
    ", we emphasize the idea of improving the degree of quantum effects in open systems , as well as obtaining qualitatively new quantum effects by applying of the sequence of tailored pulses .",
    "this approach was recently exploited for formation of high degree continuous - variable entanglement in the nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator @xcite , and for investigation of quantum interference in mesoscopic domain @xcite .",
    "recently , generation of nonclassical states in cavity qed with pulsed input has been investigated in @xcite and production of a superposition states in the periodically pulsed nonlinear resonator has been demonstrated in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "dynamics of periodically driven nonlinear oscillator has been also studied in the papers @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "we clarify the multiphoton photon blockade in kerr nonlinear resonator under pulsed excitation mainly by considering photon - number effects and by analysing phase - space properties of resonator mode .",
    "however , we have not discussed properties of the field transmission when the photons are blockaded .",
    "thus , we focus on analysis of the mean photon number , the probability distributions of photons , the second - order correlation functions of photons and the wigner functions in phase space . in this pulsed regime",
    "the ensemble - averaged mean photon numbers , the populations of photon - number states and the wigner functions are nonstationary and exhibit a periodic time dependent behavior , i.e. repeat the periodicity of the pump laser in an over transient regime . besides this the results on production of photon fock states at pb region depend on the parameters of gaussian pulses such as the amplitude , the duration of pulses and the time - interval between them , dissipation rates and kerr - interaction coupling .",
    "thus , we investigate production of photonic states for an arbitrary interaction time - intervals including also time - intervals exceeding the characteristic time of dissipative processes , @xmath1",
    ". however , the results obtained are nonstationary that is conditioned by interaction of the system with the sequence of gaussian e.m .",

    "for comparison , the paper includes the investigation of the kerr nonlinear dissipative resonator under cw driving on the framework of the potential solution of the fokker - planck equation for the quasiprobability distribution function in complex p - representation . in this way",
    ", we obtain that contrarily to the pulsed regime for the case of cw pumping there are fundamental limits on the populations of lower photonic - number - states .    the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe periodically pulsed kerr nonlinear resonator and discuss the case of cw driving in the exact quantum treatment of pb . in sec .",

    "in fact , it is well known that the hamiltonian of two - level atom interacting with cavity mode in the dispersive approximation , if the two - level system remains in its ground state , can be reduced to the effective hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",

    "an important implementation of kerr - type resonator has been recently achieved in the context of superconducting devices based on the nonlinearity of the josephson junction .",
