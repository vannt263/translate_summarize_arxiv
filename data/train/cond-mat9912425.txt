    "a variety of phenomena can be modeled by the one dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) and its generalizations ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the model has a natural interpretation as a description of traffic flow and constitutes a basis for more realistic ones @xcite . in traffic flow theories ,",
    "the formation of traffic jams due to `` impurities '' is one of the fundamental problems .    in the asep models ,",
    "two kinds of impurities are discussed in the literature .",
    "the first one is `` dynamic '' impurities , i.e. , defective particles which jump with a rate lower than others  @xcite . in the traffic terminology",
    ", such moving defects can be visualized as slow cars on a road .",
    "the other kind is `` static '' impurities such as imperfect links where the hopping rate is lower than in other links  @xcite .",
    "both types of impurities can produce shocks in a system .",
    "presently a limited amount of exact results is available for the shock formation and most of them are for models with the random sequential update  @xcite .",
    "the implementation of the update is an essential part of the definition of a model and it is of prime interest to determine whether distinct updating schemes can produce different behaviors . the aim of this work is to investigate consequences of changing the updating scheme of the model . here , we study an exactly solvable traffic model with two types of ordered sequential updates , which is identical to the model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite except for the updating schemes .",
    "consider two parallel one dimensional chains , each with @xmath0 sites and the periodic boundary condition .",
    "there are @xmath1 cars and @xmath2 trucks in the first and the second chain , respectively , and cars move to the right while trucks move to the left .",
    "we introduce inter - chain interaction that forbids a car and a truck to occupy two parallel sites simultaneously .",
    "then the state of the system can be described by a single set of occupation numbers @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( empty site ) , @xmath5 ( occupied by a car ) , or @xmath6 ( occupied by a truck ) .",
    "there are three possible hopping processes : @xmath7 the reduction factor @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is related to the width of roads : @xmath10 corresponds to a very wide road or a highway with a lane divider , and @xmath11 corresponds to a one lane road .",
    "thus the value @xmath12 can be used as a measure of the road narrowness .",
    "recently the model is studied with the random sequential update ( rsu ) . in an infinitesimal time interval @xmath13 , each link is updated with the probability that is the product of the relevant rate and @xmath13 [ since @xmath14 does not affect the dynamics at all in the rsu scheme , we choose @xmath15 for the rsu scheme ] . alternatively the ordered sequential update ( osu ) can be used .",
    "one first chooses a particular site , i.e. the site @xmath0 , and updates the state of the links consecutively either in the backward direction @xmath16 [ backward sequential update ( bsu ) ] or in the forward direction @xmath17 [ forward sequential update ( fsu ) ] .",
    "in contrast to the rsu update , the time is discrete in the bsu and fsu schemes , and in each time step , hopping occurs in links with the probabilities that are equal to the rates in eq .",

    "the two - way traffic model is equivalent to a two - species asep and it can be solved exactly by the method of the matrix product state ( mps ) . in the rsu scheme ,",
    "the steady state weight @xmath18 of a given configuration @xmath3 is proportional to the trace of the normal product of some matrices  @xcite : p_s ( _ 1,_2,,_n ) ~tr(x_1x_2x_n ) [ mpsforrsu ] where @xmath19 for @xmath20 ; @xmath21 for @xmath22 ; and @xmath23 for @xmath24 , and these matrices satisfy the quadratic algebra de= d+e ,   ae = a ,   da= a  ( )  .",
    "[ for1 ]    in a similar way , @xmath18 in the bsu ( fsu ) scheme can be written as follows : p_s(_1,_2,,_n ) ~tr(x_1x_2_n )   [ for3 ] where @xmath25 , or @xmath23 ( @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) depending on @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",

    "in both schemes , a continuous phase transition is evident : while @xmath48 is constant below the critical narrowness , it begins to drop suddenly at the critical narrowness ( @xmath49 ) , generating a cusp .",
    "thus above the critical narrowness , a single truck results in global effects .",
    "the functional dependence of the decrease differs in the two updating schemes .",

    "the appearance of a continuous transition at the critical narrowness ( @xmath49 ) is clear and the functional dependence of the truck velocity again differs in the two updating schemes .",
    "in the rsu scheme , the probability to find a car at a site depends only on its relative distance @xmath50 to the truck due to the translational invariance . in ref .",

    ", the car density becomes n(x ) = n \\ { 1 + ( n)^x }   [ nlowrsu ] which shows that the disturbance by the truck decays exponentially with a characteristic length scale @xmath54    in the ordered sequential updates , complications occur in the definition of the probability itself .",
    "since the choice of a particular site as a starting point of the update breaks the translational invariance , the probability to find a car at @xmath50 sites in front of the truck depends not only on the relative distance @xmath50 but also on the truck location .",
    "this unnecessary complication can be avoided by choosing the starting point in an even way . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is found that with this `` homogeneous '' choice , the expressions for the probability in the bsu and the fsu scheme become _ identical _ to eqs .",

    "characteristics of an exactly solvable two - way traffic model are investigated with the osu scheme and both qualitative and quantitative differences are found compared to those with the rsu scheme @xcite .",
    "our approach is based on the so - called matrix product formalism which allows analytic solutions . in the osu schemes ,",
    "the choice of a particular site as a starting point of the update breaks the translational invariance of the steady state measure , which is also evident in the form of the mps .",
    "thus an averaging over the different choices of the update starting point is necessary to restore the translational invariance to the system .",
    "performing the translationally invariant averaging , it is found that for characteristics such as the density profile of cars and the density - density correlation function , the differences in the updating schemes can be fully taken into account by the proper renormalization of the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath8 .",
    "however this is not the case with average velocities .",
    "changing the update scheme affects velocities in a more complicated manner and the renormalization of the parameters is not sufficient to account for different behaviors of @xmath56 and @xmath57 in different updating schemes . especially the dependence of @xmath48 and @xmath58 on the road narrowness @xmath59 can vary qualitatively depending on the updating schemes .    *",
