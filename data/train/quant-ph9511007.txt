    "<S> shor s algorithms for factorization and discrete logarithms on a quantum computer employ fourier transforms preceding a final measurement . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that such a fourier transform can be carried out in a semi - classical way in which a `` classical '' ( macroscopic ) signal resulting from the measurement of one bit ( embodied in a two - state quantum system ) is employed to determine the type of measurement carried out on the next bit , and so forth . in this way the two - bit gates in the fourier transform </S>",
    "<S> can all be replaced by a smaller number of one - bit gates controlled by classical signals . </S>",
    "<S> success in simplifying the fourier transform suggests that it may be worthwhile looking for other ways of using semi - classical methods in quantum computing .    </S>",
    "<S> 0 cm 0 cm -2.0 cm 23.5 cm 16.5 cm    recently shor @xcite has shown that a quantum computer @xcite , if it could be built , would be capable of solving certain problems , such as factoring long numbers , much more rapidly than is possible using currently available algorithms on a conventional computer . </S>",
    "<S> this has stimulated a lot of interest in the subject @xcite , and various proposals have been made for actually constructing such a computer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is that bits representing numbers can be embodied in two - state quantum systems , for example , in the spin degree of freedom of a spin half particle , and the computation proceeds by manipulating these bits using appropriate gates . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that quantum computations can be carried out using circuits employing one - bit gates , which produce a unitary transformation on the two - dimensional hilbert space representing a single bit , together with two - bit gates producing appropriate unitary transformations on a four - dimensional hilbert space @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one - bit gates should be much easier to construct than two - bit gates , since , for example , an arbitrary unitary transformation on the spin degree of freedom of a spin half particle can be produced by subjecting it to a suitable time - dependent macroscopic magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , a two - bit gate requires that one of the bits influence the other in a non - trivial way , and this without leaving any record in the environment , since the computer utilizes coherent quantum states .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we shall show how the quantum fourier transforms which in shor s algorithms immediately precede a final measurement can be carried out in a semi - classical fashion which requires no two - bit gates . </S>",
    "<S> the trick is to measure a particular bit and then use the result to produce a classical signal which controls a one - bit transformation carried out on the next bit just before it is measured , and so forth . </S>",
    "<S> it is of interest for at least three reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , it represents a completely new ( so far as we know ) technique for quantum computation , in which the results of certain measurements , converted into `` classical '' signals ( imagine a pulse of several volts traveling down a coaxial cable ) , can be used to influence a later step in the computation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , computing the fourier transform is considerably simplified in the sense that it requires no two - bit gates . </S>",
    "<S> third , a simple way of seeing why the semi - classical method actually works is to adopt a point of view  in technical terms , a particular family of consistent histories  in which the results of a measurement are used to infer the state of a quantum system before the measurement was carried out . </S>",
    "<S> this perspective may prove useful in thinking about other issues in quantum computing , quantum optics , and quantum effects in atomic physics .    </S>",
    "<S> since shor has described his algorithms in considerable detail in his publications @xcite , we shall not discuss them here . </S>",
    "<S> it will be sufficient to note that after a certain number of steps of the quantum computation have been carried out , the relevant quantum state @xmath0 is a coherent superposition @xcite of different states @xmath1 labeled by an integer @xmath2 between 0 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the state @xmath0 is then subjected to a unitary transformation @xmath5 , a sort of discrete fourier transform , which carries each basis state @xmath1 of the @xmath6-dimensional hilbert space into @xmath7 this is followed by a measurement of the integer @xmath8 , that is , a measurement of each of its @xmath9 bits .    </S>",
    "<S> a set of gates which carries out this fourier transform @xcite is shown in fig .  1 for @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the bits to be transformed enter from the left . </S>",
    "<S> one can imagine that they are spin 1/2 particles , with the results of the preceding computation embodied ( as a coherent superposition ) in their collective spin degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> these particles then move through a series of gates , indicated by circles , and eventually arrive at measuring devices , shown as squares , where a particular component of spin , say @xmath11 , is measured by a stern - gerlach device , with @xmath12 in units of @xmath13 interpreted as the bit @xmath14 , and @xmath15 as the bit @xmath16 .    if the binary representation of the number @xmath2 is @xmath17 with each @xmath18 zero or one , the state @xmath1 can be conveniently written as a tensor product @xmath19 using the same notation for @xmath20 , we can rewrite ( [ e.1 ] ) in the form @xmath21 where the state @xmath22 will be said to have a _ phase _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 between 0 and 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the phases @xmath24 in ( [ e.4 ] ) take the values : @xmath25 in terms of our picture of a spin half particle , @xmath26 represents a spin component of @xmath27 in a direction in the @xmath28 plane determined by @xmath23 .    the one - bit gates in the top row of fig .  1 </S>",
    "<S> transform the bit entering on the left to one leaving on the right through : @xmath29 ( in a spin picture , the spin is rotated by @xmath30 about the @xmath31 axis . ) </S>",
    "<S> the two bit gate labeled with an integer @xmath32 converts the bits entering on the left into those leaving on the right according to the scheme : @xmath33|11\\rg .      </S>",
    "<S> \\end{array } \\label{e.8}\\ ] ] here we use the convention that the left element in each ket @xmath34 in ( [ e.8 ] ) is the bit which in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 enters the two - bit gate at a point marked by a black dot and also leaves at a black dot , while the right element in each ket denotes the bit which enters and leaves the gate at a point labeled by a circle .    </S>",
    "<S> it is helpful to think of ( [ e.8 ] ) as a transformation in which one bit acts as a `` control '' which enters and leaves the gate as a zero or one , while the other `` target '' bit enters as @xmath26 and undergoes a phase shift , so that it leaves as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 . from this perspective </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see how the network in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 produces the desired result . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the bit @xmath37 enters the left - most one - bit gate in fig .  1 in the state @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> it emerges at the point @xmath38 in the state @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> as it passes downwards through the successive two bit gates its phase is shifted by the bits @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , acting as control bits , by an amount @xmath43 if , on the other hand , @xmath37 arrives as @xmath14 , the one - bit gate converts it to @xmath44 , so that the bit which emerges as @xmath45 has a phase @xmath46 , in agreement with ( [ e.6 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the same sort of analysis can be applied to the rest of the circuit .    </S>",
    "<S> however , one can equally well regard the bits entering and leaving the gates through the black dots in fig .  1 as the control bits , and it is this point of view which is useful for constructing the semiclassical fourier transform . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the final measurement reveals that the bit @xmath45 is 1 , corresponding to @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> then , since a control bit enters and leaves the two - bit gates unchanged , we conclude that this bit was also in the state @xmath14 at point @xmath38 , just after emerging from the first one - bit gate . similarly , </S>",
    "<S> if the measurement yields @xmath47 , we conclude that the bit was in the state @xmath16 at the point @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the circuit would work equally well if the measurement on this bit were actually carried out at the point @xmath38 in fig .  1 </S>",
    "<S> , were it not for the fact that this bit is also needed in order to influence @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , now regarded as target bits , as they pass through the two - bit gates controlled by @xmath45 . however , if @xmath45 is measured at @xmath38 and the result is converted to a classical signal , this signal can be used to determine the action of a corresponding set of one - bit gates acting upon @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .    applying this type of analysis to the other parts of fig .  1 , </S>",
    "<S> one is led to the arrangement shown in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  2 , where all the two bit gates in fig .  1 have been eliminated , and their work taken over by one - bit gates controlled by classical signals ( double lines ) and followed by measurements . </S>",
    "<S> each of the boxes in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 performs the following operations . </S>",
    "<S> the incoming bit is first subjected to a unitary transformation , equivalent to a phase shift followed by ( [ e.7 ] ) : @xmath48 where @xmath23 is the phase transmitted as a classical signal from the previous box . </S>",
    "<S> the bit is then measured to yield the result @xmath49 or @xmath50 . the outputs are two classical signals represented by double lines : one is the result of the measurement , and the other represents a phase @xmath51 which is sent to the next box . </S>",
    "<S> the very first box uses @xmath52 in ( [ e.10 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> readers unfamiliar with the rules which allow one to use the results of a measurement to infer the state of a quantum system prior to the measurement are referred to the relevant literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is that one can add to a quantum history , consisting of an initial state and the result of a measurement , a projector , for example @xmath53 representing property of the quantum system at a time just prior to the measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the conditional probability of @xmath54 is one , given that the measurement yields @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> but in the situation shown in fig .  1 , @xmath54 commutes with the unitary transformations corresponding to the three 2-bit gates which precede the measurement of @xmath45 , and therefore one can `` push '' the corresponding property backwards in time to the point @xmath38 in fig .  1 , and again conclude that it occurred with probability one . </S>",
    "<S> anyone who feels uncomfortable with this method of reasoning can , of course , use traditional techniques to verify that the arrangement in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 will yield the same probability to observe a number @xmath8 as that in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that it is necessary to check this for an initial state @xmath0 which is an arbitrary linear combination of the different @xmath1 states . )    </S>",
    "<S> the scheme in fig .  2 should be quite a bit simpler to realize than that in fig .  1 , because it only requires one - bit operations controlled by classical signals rather than the more difficult and more numerous two - bit operations indicated in fig .  1 </S>",
    "<S> however , the need to carry out a measurement on one bit before beginning to measure another could be a disadvantage if the physical elements representing the bits are short lived or decohere rapidly on the time scale required to carry out a measurement and convert it into a classical signal . if this turns out to be a problem , a possible remedy might be to arrange the earlier part of the quantum computation in such a way that the more significant bits of @xmath2 are produced earlier than the less significant bits .    </S>",
    "<S> an important question is whether other parts of shor s algorithms ( or other applications of quantum computing ) can make use of similar semi - classical operations . </S>",
    "<S> we have no specific proposals , but we think the idea is worth further study . </S>",
    "<S> there are bits other than those entering the final fourier transform which are produced elsewhere in the computation , and it is conceivable that measuring some of these could be used in modify later steps in the calculation , or perhaps for the non - trivial task of correcting errors . in connection with the latter , </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that adopting alternative perspectives or points of view about what is going on in a quantum computation can yield useful insights . </S>",
    "<S> the traditional perspective , represented in almost all work on quantum computing up till now , in which the `` wave function of the computer '' develops unitarily in time until a measurement is made , has demonstrated its value through the work of various people who have brought quantum computation to its current state of development . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that an alternative point of view , in which the results of measurements are traced backwards in time , can also be valuable . </S>",
    "<S> the general principles of quantum mechanics allow for a variety of viewpoints or , to use the technical term , consistent families , and recent developments in the foundations of quantum theory @xcite permit one to make effective use of these without becoming entangled in paradoxes , mysterious long - range influences , and the like . </S>"
