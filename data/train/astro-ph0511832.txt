    "open clusters ( ocs ) have been recognized since a long time to be among the best objects to study the galactic disk ( e.g. , janes & phelps 1994 , friel 1995 , twarog , ashman & anthony - twarog 1997 ) .",
    "we have an on going project aimed at exploiting their ability to trace the present properties of the disk , its history and evolution by collecting photometric and spectroscopic data of a large sample of old ocs and deriving in a precise and homogeneous way their fundamental properties ( age , distance , reddening , chemical abundance ) . an updated review of our general project , although mostly focussed on the photometric part , can be found in bragaglia & tosi ( 2005 ) .",
    "this paper is devoted to ngc 3960 ( c 1148 - 554 ) , an intermediate age open cluster located at ra(2000 ) = 11:50:40 , dec(2000 ) = 55:40:28 , or l = 294.41 , b = 6.18 .",
    "we have acquired ccd photometry of two fields and high - resolution spectra of three stars , which have allowed us to derive the cluster age , distance , reddening and chemical abundances .",
    "there are two main literature papers about this cluster based on photometry .",
    "janes ( 1981 , hereafter j81 ) first published its cmd , based on bv photographic photometry for 318 stars , 98 of which have also photoelectric measures .",
    "his estimate of the cluster parameters are : = 11.1 @xmath2 0.2 , e(b - v ) = 0.29 @xmath2 0.02 , and age slightly older than the hyades .",
    "more recently , prisinzano et al . ( 2004 , hereafter p04 ) used data obtained with the wide field imager at the eso - max planck 2.2 m telescope in the @xmath6 bands to determine an age between 0.9 and 1.4 gyr and = 11.35 using isochrones with z = 0.01 , the metallicity given by friel et al .",
    "they also inferred the luminosity ( and mass ) function .",
    "they find strong indications of differential reddening , with  varying from 0.16 to 0.62 over the about 30 @xmath7 30 arcmin@xmath8 field of view , with a value of 0.29 near the cluster centre .",
    "the metallicity of ngc 3960 has been found to be subsolar by many studies , but the individual estimates range from [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.68 to @xmath90.06 .",
    "j81 obtained ddo data for six giants , and derived [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.3 @xmath2 0.06 , while flynn & mermilliod ( 1991 ) and piatti , clari & abadi ( 1992 ) , using improved ddo abundance calibrations , derived [ fe / h ] = @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "friel & janes ( 1993 ) , using low resolution spectroscopy , found [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.34 @xmath2 0.08 , and determined the membership status of 7 giants .",
    "geisler , clari & minniti ( 1992 ) , using washington photometry of the cluster giants , determined [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.68 @xmath2 0.28 .",
    "paunzen & maitzen ( 2002 ) observed ngc 3960 among other clusters in their search for chemically peculiar stars using the @xmath3a system ( a three filter photometric narrow band system ) , and found only one .",
    "finally , mermilliod et al . ( 2001 ) determined precise radial velocities for 14 red giants , and ubv photoelectric magnitudes for 6 of them .",
    "ngc 3960 has been included in two recent papers aimed at analyzing open clusters properties in a homogeneous way : twarog et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , on the basis of j81 data , found a galactocentric distance r@xmath12 = 7.95 kpc , a distance from the sun of 1.73 kpc , and a metallicity [ fe / h]=0.17 ; carraro , ng & portinari ( 1998 ) applied the synthetic cmd method , using j81 photometry , friel & janes ( 1993 ) metal abundance , and the padova tracks ( bertelli et al .",
    "1994 ) , determining r@xmath12 = 8 kpc , and an age of 0.6 gyr .",
    "we describe our photometric data in section 2 ; cmds resulting from the photometry are presented in section 3 , while section 4 is devoted to their application to derive the cluster parameters .",
    "spectroscopic analysis and derivation of the cluster chemical abundances are presented in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "finally , results are discussed and summarized in section 7 .",
    "ngc 3960 was observed with dfosc ( danish faint object spectrograph and camera ) at the 1.54 m danish telescope located in la silla , chile , on 2001 january 24 , and 2001 may 16 and 17 .",
    "dfosc was equipped with the back - illuminated ccd eev 42 - 80 ( 2048x4096 pixels , but only half of the ccd is actually used ) with a scale of 0.39 arcsec / pix and a field of view of 13.3 @xmath7 13.3 arcmin@xmath8 .",
    "we used the johnson - bessel - gunn @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( eso 450 , 451 , and 425 ) and @xmath16 ( eso 632 , in may only ) filters ; table 1 gives a log of the observations .",

    "all frames were trimmed and corrected for bias and flat fields in the standard way , using iraf tasks .",
    "we then used daophot ",
    "ii , also in iraf environment , to find and measure stars ( stetson 1987 , davis 1994 ) .",
    "all frames were searched independently , using the appropriate value for the fwhm of the stellar profile and a threshold of 4 @xmath17 over the local sky value .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were measured with a moffat psf .",
    "the resulting catalogues were selected in error ( @xmath18 0.1 mag ) , in @xmath19 ( only to eliminate the very bad cases , i.e. the almost saturated stars ) , and in sharpness ( a shape defining parameter , useful to discriminate between stars and spurious or extended objects ) .",
    "the output catalogues were then aligned to a reference frame in each filter , for which aperture corrections ( i.e. , the difference between aperture and psf magnitudes ) and extinction corrections were derived . finally , the instrumental @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath15 magnitudes for each star were computed from a ( weighted ) average of the individual values . using dedicated software by p. montegriffo ( private communication ) ,",

    "three clump stars in ngc 3960 were selected among the true cluster members on the basis of the radial velocities ( rvs ) measured by friel & janes ( 1993 ) , later confirmed by mermilliod et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and by our own measures .",
    "they were observed in 2001 ( february and april ) with feros ( fiber - fed extended range optical spectrograph ) mounted at the 1.5 m telescope in la silla ( chile ) at r = 48000 , with a wavelength coverage of @xmath23 3700 - 8600  ; a log of the observations is given in table [ t : spe1 ] , together with photometric information .",
    "the averaged spectra for each stars have high signal to noise ratio ; s / n is 100 for stars 28 and 41 , and 80 for star 50 ( measured near 6150  ) .",
    "the heliocentric rvs perfectly agree with the ones in mermilliod et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for stars 28 and 41 ( 4358 and 4351 in our numbering system ) .",
    "star 50 ( 4324 in our numbering system ) is a long period spectroscopic binary and our 3 spectra taken on the same night can not produce a significant average value ; with rv @xmath24 -15 km s@xmath25 they appear compatible with the known rv and amplitude of the rv curve ( mermilliod et al . 2001 : rv = @xmath922.31 km s@xmath25 , k = 12.92 km s@xmath25 ) .",
    "these spectra have been obtained , reduced , and analyzed exactly as described in bragaglia et al .",

    "( 2004 , 2005 ) . here",
    "we present the results and refer to those papers for a detailed description of the method used .",
    "equivalent widths ( @xmath26s ) were measured employing an updated version of the rosa spectrum analysis package ( gratton 1988 ) .",
    "as usual , we restricted to the 5500 - 7000    spectral range for fe lines , and employed the entire spectrum for the other species .",
    "sources of oscillator strengths and atomic parameters are the same as gratton et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "effective temperature ( @xmath27 ) and gravity ( @xmath28 ) for each star were derived from the spectra using the excitation and ionization equilibria for iron , respectively .",
    "the microturbulent velocity ( @xmath29 ) was derived assuming the relation between @xmath28 and @xmath29 given in carretta et al .",
    "these parameters , along with iron abundances , are shown in table [ t : spe2 ] .",
    "errors were estimated as in carretta et al .",
    "they comprise a systematic part ( due e.g. , to uncertainties in the adopted oscillator strengths ) and a random part ( due e.g. , to the different s / n ratios ) that represents the internal error ; random errors have been found to be 62 k in @xmath27 , 0.25 dex in @xmath28 , 0.17 km s@xmath25 in @xmath29 , and 0.05 dex in [ a / h ] .",
    "sensitivity of the parameters on the internal errors can be found in tab .",
    "3 of carretta et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    as our spectroscopically determined temperatures are reddening - free , we can derive an independent measure of the reddening .",
    "we entered the spectroscopically determined @xmath27 s into the colour - temperature transformations by alonso , arribas & martnez - roger ( 1999 ) and obtained de - reddened colours to be compared to the observed ones based on our @xmath30 photometry and the 2mass @xmath31 values ( cutri et al .",
    "the reddening for the three stars is given in table [ t : red ] .",
    "we estimate errors on these s to be at most 0.02 - 0.03 mag , assuming a conservative error of @xmath2 0.1 dex in metallicity and 90 k in @xmath27 .",
    "values from @xmath32 and @xmath33 [ adopting @xmath34 ; cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ] are almost identical for each star ( less than 0.01 mag at the most ) .",
    "the average reddening is = 0.301 , with large differences among the three stars ( rms = 0.068 ) .",
    "even if the spectroscopic sample is very small , both average value and scatter around it are compatible with what we derived (= 0.29 , @xmath3= 0.05 ) from the photometric data of the central part of the cluster , where all three stars are located .",
    "the iron abundances derived from @xmath26s were checked using synthetic spectra of about 20 - 25 selected iron lines , as amply described in carretta et al .",
    "the average difference between abundances derived from @xmath26s and from synthesis is @xmath35 dex , without a systematic trend , so we deemed to have achieved the accuracy in continuum tracing and @xmath26 measurement attainable with these spectra .",
    "when we average the three stars we obtain [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.12 @xmath2 0.02 , rms 0.05 dex ; this error bar is simply the standard error of the mean .",
    "this metallicity is based on high resolution spectroscopy , the best technique to derive accurate chemical abundances , so it should supersede other measurements , to which anyway we may compare it . from the synthetic cmd method we find z = 0.01 or 0.02 , i.e. [ fe / h]=@xmath90.3 or 0 .",
    "literature values ( see introduction ) range from [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.68 ( based on washington photometry , that gives systematically lower results ) to @xmath36 ( ddo photometry and low resolution spectroscopy ) or @xmath90.06 ( another calibration of ddo photometry ) .",
    "abundances were also derived for the light elements na , al , for the @xmath5-process elements mg , al , ca , ti i and ii , the fe - group elements sc ii , v , cr i and ii , mn , co , ni , and for the @xmath37-capture element ba ii . we corrected the na abundance for departures from lte following gratton et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , while those of sc , v , mn , co , and ba have hyper - fine structure ( hfs ) taken into account whenever necessary",
    ". abundances of c , n , o are deferred to a dedicated paper since they require synthetic spectrum analysis .",
    "results for each star and the cluster averages are presented in table [ t : abutot ] , together with the reference solar values adopted .",
    "abundances from different ionization stages ( ti i and ti ii , cr i and cr ii ) are in very good accord , endorsing the adopted atmospheric parameters .",
    "the three stars do not seem to show scatter in any of the abundances , as we already found for the other ocs studied .",
    "the @xmath5-elements have a value slightly over solar ( + 0.10 ) , while na is clearly overabundant ( + 0.32 ) , in line with the old oc population ( friel et al .",
    "2003 , carretta et al .",
    "ngc 3960 does not show any striking peculiarity , and its composition will be considered in conjunction with the ones of the other ocs in our sample in forthcoming papers .",
    "we have analyzed photometric and high resolution spectroscopic data for the open cluster ngc 3960 , and found age , distance , reddening and metallicity using the synthetic cmd method and fine abundance analysis .",
    "our best estimates are : age of 0.9 gyr or 0.6 gyr ( using stellar models with / without overshooting ) , = 11.6 @xmath2 0.1 , = 0.29 @xmath2 0.02 ( with a differential reddening @xmath3= 0.05 ) , metallicity between solar and half of solar from the photometry and [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.12 ( rms 0.05 ) dex from the spectra .      at the distance of ngc 3960 derived from the synthetic cmds ( 2.1 kpc from the sun ) the external field observed at 30 arcmin from the cluster centre",
    "is at 18.3 pc . the fact that it clearly contains stars falling on the ms of the cluster cmd shows that these stars have been able to travel this distance from their original birthplace .",
    "we have found that about half of the cluster stars fainter than @xmath14 = 15 ( i.e. with mass lower than @xmath241.6 ) are likely to have evaporated from the central region .",
    "existence of segregation and evaporation is in agreement with what p04 found from their analysis .",
    "they derived the luminosity and mass functions , corrected for the presence of field stars , for the central part of the cluster ( see their figs .",
    "15 and 16 ) ; their mass function drops below about 1 m@xmath38 , because of the combination of incompleteness and mass segregation that moves the lighter stars outside the considered radius ( larger than ours : 7 arcmin ) .",
    "the differential reddening values of 0.1 in  in the central area of 4 arcmin radius agrees with the amount proposed by p04 for the same zone , although they suggest the higher value of @xmath3=0.57 over their much larger field of view .",
    "the average ( central ) reddening resulting from the best fitting synthetic cmds is supported by the two - colours diagram .",
    "it also compares very well with the literature values ( except schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) and with that inferred from the spectroscopic analysis of the clump stars that show some evidence of differential reddening too .",
    "analysis of feros spectra of three clump stars was used to derive the detailed chemical composition of the cluster , determining abundance of iron , @xmath5-elements and heavier elements .",
    "their behaviour is similar to what has usually been found for old open clusters .",
    "the cluster metallicity derived from our high - resolution spectra , [ fe / h ] = @xmath90.12 , corresponds to a metal mass fraction z@xmath390.015 .",
    "this value is between those available for the stellar evolutionary tracks and this explains the ambiguity in the choice between the z=0.01 and the z=0.02 synthetic models .",
    "we consider this result as quite favourable , taking into account that the stellar model metallicity depends on a series of parameters , such as opacities , photometric conversions , etc .",
