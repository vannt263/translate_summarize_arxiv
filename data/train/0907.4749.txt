    "phenix has measured the non - photonic electron spectrum in @xmath3+@xmath3 @xcite and au+au @xcite at @xmath2 = 200 gev in the pseudorapidity range @xmath4 .",
    "the non - photonic electrons have been interpreted as coming almost entirely from decays of open heavy flavor hadrons .",
    "phenix has now calculated that approximately 16% of the electron signal at high @xmath1 actually comes from @xmath0 decays .",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath1 spectrum from @xmath3+@xmath3 collisions has been measured by phenix out to 9 gev/@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the data from this measurement is used as an input to a monte carlo event generator to determine the yield of electrons from the decay of @xmath0 particles . to determine the appropriate input to the event generator , two functional fits to the @xmath0 data",
    "are performed .",
    "the first uses the so - called kaplan function of the form @xmath6 , and the second uses the @xmath7 scaling function used in @xcite .",
    "the values of the electron spectrum from the event generator using the two different functional forms are averaged .",
    "the systematic errors on the @xmath0 measurement are propagated to errors on the electron spectrum .",

    "although the background at the highest @xmath1 is increased by 50% , the signal to background is well above 1 in that @xmath1 range @xcite , and the change in the heavy flavor signal is less than 20% , as can be seen from figure [ fig : ppyield ] .    , @xmath8 , and drell - yan contributions.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] , @xmath8 , and drell - yan contributions.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    estimations for the contribution from upsilon and drell - yan were also considered , but were found to be quite small .    in the case of au+au collisions ,",
    "the @xmath0 is only measured in phenix out to @xmath1 of about 5 gev/@xmath5 . in order to gain an estimation of the @xmath0 contribution to the electron spectrum in au+au , we made two conservative estimations of the upper and lower bound of the @xmath0 yield at high @xmath1 using the measured @xmath9 @xcite in the 0 - 20% centrality range .",
    "for the lower bound on the @xmath0 yield , we assume that the @xmath9 stays constant at about 0.34 out to 10 gev/@xmath5 , and for the upper bound we assumed that it increases linearly from 0.34 to 1.0 between 5 gev/@xmath5 and 10 gev/@xmath5 .",
    "the resulting @xmath9 for single electrons for 0 - 20% centrality with and without the @xmath0 contributions can be seen in figure [ fig : eraa ] .     of non - photonic electrons before ( `` total '' ) and after ( `` open '' ) subtraction of the @xmath0 contributions .",
    ", scaledwidth=55.0% ]    as both the @xmath3+@xmath3 and au+au single electron yields from heavy flavor decays decreased as a result of subtracting the @xmath0 contribution , the resulting change in @xmath9 is small .",
    "note that phenix previously highlighted the @xmath9 in 0 - 10% centrality @xcite , but here we show the 0 - 20% centrality range as that is how the @xmath0 was measured .",
    "phenix has previously measured the yield of prompt single muons at forward rapidity in @xmath3+@xmath3 collisions @xcite . these prompt",
    "muons are attributed to semileptonic decays of open heavy flavor hadrons .",
    "phenix has now measured the yield of single muons from cu+cu collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev in the pseudorapidity range @xmath10 .",
    "the measurement methodology used for cu+cu collisions is very similar to what was used for the @xmath3+@xmath3 collisions .",
    "perhaps the largest change for the cu+cu is the calculation of multiplicity - dependent efficiency loss .",
    "tracking in the phenix muon arms can suffer in the presence of many tracks .",
    "we embedded hits in the muon arms from simulated single muons into real events and attempted to reconstruct the simulated muons .",
    "the efficiency for reconstructing muons in 0 - 20% centrality events was found to be approximately 20% lower than the efficiency in 40 - 94% centrality events .",
    "additional particles were also included in the background subtraction .",
    "in addition to background from muons from hadron decays , hadrons which make it through all of the absorber layers also must be subtracted , as described in @xcite .",
    "compared to the previous @xmath3+@xmath3 analysis , this analysis also used a more careful calculation of the expected hadronic background .",
    "particles which make it through only some of the absorber layers are considered to be hadrons",
    ". simulations of hadronic interactions in the muon arms are compared to the stopped hadron distributions , and the subtracted background is tuned accordingly .",
    "regions of the detector in which the simulation does not match the data well are not used in the analysis .     of prompt single muons in cu+cu collisions .",

    "although the systematic errors are large , significant suppression of heavy flavor at forward rapidity can be seen in the 0 - 20% centrality range .",
    "it is interesting to note that the central value of the 0 - 20% @xmath9 for @xmath11 2 gev/@xmath5 is smaller than that of electrons at mid - rapidity at the same @xmath12 , which can be seen from figure [ fig : mraa ] . this would be quite surprising if true , but we must await future detector and luminosity upgrades before being able to make a firm statement on this issue ."
