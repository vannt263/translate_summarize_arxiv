    "the toric @xmath0-polynomial of a lower eulerian partially ordered set , introduced by stanley  @xcite is a highly sophisticated invariant . as noted by stanley himself",
    "@xcite , it `` seems quite difficult to compute , '' `` without using the laborious defining recurrence '' . yet in those few cases where a combinatorial interpretation was found , it lead to deep enumerative results .",
    "an excellent example of this is chan s work  @xcite who showed that the toric @xmath0-polynomial of a shellable cubical complex has nonnegative coefficients , by finding a set of highly nontrivial enumeration problems for which the number of objects counted turns out to be exactly the contribution of a cubical shelling component to a given coefficient in the toric @xmath0-polynomial .",
    "she later extended her results in collaboration with billera and liu  @xcite showing that the toric @xmath0-polynomial of a star - shellable cubical complex is the @xmath0-polynomial of a shellable simplicial complex .",
    "it seems that very little has been done in the area ever since .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to convince the reader that the toric @xmath0-polynomials of shellable cubical complexes are worth a `` second look '' .",
    "there are other combinatorial models for chan s results , some of them linked to her model via non - trivial bijections , others may be derived in the future from an unexpected and unstated appearance of the toric @xmath1-polynomial of a cubical lattice in the work of denise and simion  @xcite .",
    "the explicit formulas we find for the contribution of each shelling component to the toric @xmath0-polynomial of a shellable cubical complex link the study of these polynomials to the combinatorics of catalan numbers .",
    "it is not the first time that such a connection appears in the literature : the formulas of bayer and ehrenborg  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 4.1 and 4.2 ) expressing the toric @xmath0-polynomial of an eulerian poset in terms of its flag @xmath0-vector and @xmath2-index abound in catalan numbers , and same holds for the formula of billera and brenti  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.3 ) expressing the kazhdan - lusztig polynomial of any bruhat interval in any coxeter group in terms of the complete @xmath2-index .",
    "our paper is structured as follows .",
    "after the preliminaries , in section  [ s_expl ] we use chan s recursions  @xcite to build explicit formulas for the contribution of each shelling component to the toric @xmath0-polynomial of a shellable cubical complex .",
    "these formulas are meant to serve as `` yardstick '' , against which present or future combinatorial models can be measured .    in section  [ s_pte ]",
    "we introduce a new combinatorial model , counting the total weight of postorder trees which are weighted according to the numbers of `` first - born '' leaf children , not `` first - born '' leaf children and `` first - born '' non - leaf children in the tree .",
    "the greatest simplification occurs when we prove the variant of the gessel - shapiro result  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.71 g ) on the toric @xmath1-polynomial of a cubical lattice .",
    "the original variant counts forks in a plane tree , and the easiest proof on record involves solving a quadratic equation for a generating function , whereas in our model we count `` first - born '' leaves in plane trees and there is a proof essentially based on inclusion - exclusion . in our model ,",
    "all three types of `` special vertices '' are equally simply defined , whereas the third type of `` special vertices '' in chan s original model  @xcite has a little more technical definition .",
    "our model is closely related to chan s original model  @xcite , and a bijection is outlined in section  [ s_reflect ] .",
    "this calls for transforming a preorder tree into a binary tree , reflecting the binary tree in the plane , transforming it back to a plane tree , whose mirror image is a postorder tree . under this",
    "correspondence forks in the postorder tree correspond to first - born leaf children of a nonroot parent , and the other two classes of special vertices also turn out to be bijective equivalents of the classes in  @xcite .",
    "the postorder tree model is easily transformed into a noncrossing partition model , and the results of chan  @xcite have a rephrasing in terms of noncrossing partitions , where we need to consider a statistics of nonsingleton blocks , singleton blocks , and elements that are not the minimum in their block , nor are they the maximum in a block that does not contain @xmath3 .",
    "this is shown in section  [ s_nc ] .",
    "we also note that the gessel - shapiro result has a variant in the work of denise and simion  @xcite .",
    "this observation allows us to present a new recursion formula for the toric @xmath1-polynomials of cubical lattices , and establish a relation between these polynomials and the morgan - voyce polynomials via viennot s combinatorial theory of orthogonal polynomials  @xcite .",
    "this connection deserves further study in a future work .",
    "hopefully our `` second look '' will not be the last look at these remarkable polynomials , and in the concluding section  [ s_c ] we collect some of the questions raised by the present work .",
    "i wish to thank mireille bousquet - mlou for acquainting me with viennot s work  @xcite , louis billera for advice and encouragement , and clara chan for valuable information on the toric @xmath0-polynomials of cubical complexes .",

    "we associate its number , @xmath276 , of occurrences of two consecutive steps of the form @xmath277 or @xmath278 or @xmath279 or @xmath280 .",

    "* lemma 3.3 ) , the polynomial @xmath287 is the total weight of all noncrossing partitions @xmath147 of @xmath288 where the weight of @xmath147 is @xmath289 the proof of this fact is very similar to our proof of our lemma  [ l_gs ] .",
    "it begins with stating that one may start with an arbitrary noncrossing partition o @xmath290 elements ( counted by a catalan number ) and then insert @xmath71 additional points in any of @xmath291 ways .",
    "the @xmath71 additional points inserted will be the ( marked ) filler points , the rest of the proof is slightly different only because a different weight function is used .",
    "that said , from a combinatorial perspective , inserting a filler after a prescribed element in a non - crossing partition is an operation that behaves exactly the same way as attaching a first - born leaf to a nonroot vertex .",
    "thus , in analogy of lemma  [ l_gs ] , we have the following statement .",
    "[ l_gsf ] the coefficient of @xmath118 in @xmath63 is the number of noncrossing partitions on @xmath231 with @xmath93 fillers .",

    "it is easy to verify that this simplicial complex is not isomorphic in general to the one introduced by billera , chan , and liu  ( * ? ? ?",

    "( [ e_gp ] ) implies @xmath297 substituting this into ( [ e_prec ] ) we obtain that @xmath298 is the sum of @xmath299 and of @xmath300 multiplying both sides by @xmath301 and adding @xmath302 to both sides yields @xmath303 canceling the terms @xmath304 and @xmath305 which also appear with a negative sign and shifting the index @xmath93 up by one yields the stated identity .",
    "we conclude this section by observing that corollary  [ c_ds ] links the study of the cubical toric @xmath0-polynomials to the combinatorial theory of orthogonal polynomials developed by viennot  @xcite .",
    "this theory uses weighted motzkin paths to find the _ moment functional _ of an orthogonal polynomial sequence given by a recursion formula . recall that a moment functional is a linear map @xmath306\\rightarrow { \\mathbb k}$ ] from a polynomial ring to its field of scalars , and it is uniquely defined by the _ moments _ @xmath307 .",
    "a sequence of polynomials @xmath308 is orthogonal with respect to the moment functional @xmath309 if @xmath310 whenever @xmath311 .",

    "if an orthogonal polynomial sequence @xmath312 is defined by the recursion formula @xmath313 subject to the initial conditions @xmath314 and @xmath315 , then the sequence @xmath308 is orthogonal with respect to the moment functional @xmath316\\rightarrow { \\mathbb k}$ ] where @xmath307 is the total weight of all motzkin paths from @xmath110 to @xmath272 such that each @xmath317 step has weight @xmath3 , each horizontal step at abscissa @xmath64 has weight @xmath318 and each @xmath319 step starting at abscissa @xmath64 has weight @xmath320 .",
    "thus corollary  [ c_ds ] suggests that the polynomials @xmath321 are related to the orthogonal polynomial sequence @xmath308 , defined by the recursion formula @xmath322 subject to the initial conditions @xmath314 and @xmath323 . introducing @xmath324 we obtain the recursion formula @xmath325 subject to the initial conditions @xmath326 and @xmath327 .",
    "these are exactly the _ morgan - voyce polynomials _ which are widely studied .",
    "they first appeared in the study of electrical networks  @xcite , some of the other early references include swamy s work  @xcite and  @xcite , the latest publication on them appeared in 2008  @xcite . by corollary  [ c_ds ] , the linear map defined by @xmath328 may be considered as a polynomial generalization of the moment functional of the morgan - voyce polynomials .",
    "while giving a few modest answers , this paper raises many questions .",
    "the first ones are inspired by the results of section  [ s_reflect ] .",
    "what we can observe , that by applying a sequence of involutions ( taking mirror images of appropriate objects after and before applying a less trivial bijection and its inverse ) we obtain a different model , in which the the definitions of the special vertices become overall a little less technical .",
    "there are many other ways to transform chan s model , but when we take a `` random '' transformation , we usually end up with highly technical definitions for our special vertices . in this sense",
    ", the transformation presented in section  [ s_reflect ] appears to be a `` lucky guess '' ( actually it was not , the new model was built directly , inspired by the formulas in section  [ s_expl ] , the bijection was found later ) .",
    "is there a way to recode the original model into an even simpler one ? or is it better to start with a completely different model , inspired by some other form of the formulas in section  [ s_expl ] ? at a more philosophical level , it seems that `` easy '' combinatorial transformations take one statistics of plane trees into another statistic of plane trees .",
    "analogous results for permutation statistics have been produced for over a hundred year , perhaps it is worthwhile to take a similar systematic approach to the study of various statistics on plane trees .",
    "we have a strong reason to suspect that the variant of the gessel - shapiro result that may be found in the work of denise and simion  @xcite will not be shown equivalent via some bijection that is similar to the one presented in section  [ s_reflect ] .",
    "as it was mentioned after lemma  [ l_gsf ] , it is possible to construct a new simplicial complex verifying the billera - chan - liu result  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2 ) stating that the toric @xmath0-polynomial of a cube is the @xmath0-polynomial of a simplicial complex",
    ". however , the resulting simplicial complex will not be isomorphic to the one that can be found in  @xcite .",
    "for the postorder tree model , obviously , one ends up constructing essentially the same simplicial complex ( associated to the same noncrossing partitions ) .",
    "thus it may be worthwhile to generalize the denise - simion colored motzkin path enumeration problem for @xmath129 to questions whose answers are given by the polynomials @xmath132 .",
    "this seems feasible since , as it was noted above , essentially the same insertion technique may be used to prove lemma  [ l_gsf ] as the one used to show lemma  [ l_gs ] .",
    "one only needs to come up with the appropriate analog of type @xmath113 and type @xmath114 special elements such that the analogues of lemma  [ l_t1 ] and lemma  [ l_t2 ] become valid .",
    "obviously it would be great to use one of the new variants ( presented or to be worked out ) to extend the results of billera , chan , and liu   to all shellable cubical complexes .",
    "this seems hard , because after careful reading of  @xcite we will discover that the construction does not only depend on constructing shellable simplicial complexes associated to cubical shelling components but one also changes the underlying cubical complex .",
    "no further generalization seems possible there without modifying or generalizing that rearranging of cubes .",
    "finally the most interesting and enigmatic question is raised by the connection between the polynomials @xmath321 and the morgan - voyce polynomials .",
    "is it a coincidence or is there a deeper reason ?",
    "is there a way to relate other @xmath1-polynomials to orthogonal polynomials ?",
    "is there a way to extend the correspondence to all polynomials @xmath132 ? if nothing else , these questions certainly make a future `` third look '' at the toric @xmath0-polynomials of cubical complexes worthwhile .",
