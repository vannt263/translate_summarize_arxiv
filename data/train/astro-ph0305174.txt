    "the gravitational lensing of distant sources has in recent years become one of the most powerful tools in observational cosmology ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ; @xcite and references therein ) . since the effects of gravitational lensing depend upon the redshift of the source , the cosmological background , and the distribution of matter in the universe , they can be used to constrain the cosmological parameters and the primordial power spectrum of density fluctuations from which structure originates .",
    "in addition , many of the effects produced by gravitational lenses , such as image multiplicity , separations , and time delay , depend strongly upon the matter distribution inside the lenses .",
    "hence , measurements of these effects can provide a unique tool for probing the matter distribution inside collapsed objects like galaxies and clusters , providing the only direct measurement of their dark matter content , and constraining the theory of their formation and evolution .",
    "until recently , the internal structure of halos adopted in lensing studies was generally some gravitational equilibrium distribution , either singular or nonsingular ( e.g. , king model , singular isothermal sphere , pseudo - isothermal sphere ) , not necessarily motivated directly by the theory of cosmological halo formation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . as the theory of halo formation in the cdm model has advanced in recent years , however , the halo mass profiles adopted for lensing models have been refined to reflect this theory .",
    "numerical simulations of large - scale structure formation in cold dark matter ( cdm ) universes predict that galaxies and clusters have a singular density profile which approaches a power law @xmath3 at the center , with the exponent @xmath4 ranging from 1 to 1.5 @xcite .",
    "these results are in apparent conflict with observations of rotation curves of dark - matter - dominated dwarf galaxies and low surface brightness galaxies , which favor a flat - density core ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . on the scale of clusters of galaxies , observations of strong gravitational lensing of background galaxies by foreground clusters also favor the presence of a finite - density core in the centers of clusters ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "several possible explanations have been suggested in order to explain this discrepancy .",
    "the rotation curve data might lack sufficient spatial resolution near the center to distinguish unambiguously between a density profile with a flat - density core and one with a singular profile ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "attempts have also been made to improve the numerical resolving power of the simulations to obtain a more accurate determination of the slope of the predicted density profiles at small radii ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , if the flat - core interpretation of the observations and the singular cusps predicted by the numerical simulations are both correct , then the simulation algorithms may be ignoring some physical process which would , if included , serve to flatten the halo density profiles at small radii relative to the results for purely gravitational , n - body dynamics of cold , collisionless dark matter , while retaining the more successful aspects of the cdm model .",
    "for example , gasdynamical processes which involve dissipation and radiative cooling , and perhaps energy - release feedback associated with stars and quasars ( see , e.g. @xcite ) or modifications of the microscopic properties of the dark matter , such as self - interacting dark matter @xcite , warm dark matter @xcite , fluid dark matter @xcite , fuzzy dark matter @xcite , decaying dark matter @xcite , annihilating dark matter @xcite , or repulsive dark matter @xcite , all have the potential to lower the central density of halos and possibly reconcile simulations with observations .    lensing by the two kinds of halo mass profiles , singular versus flat - core , will be different .",
    "this has led to attempts to predict the differences expected if the halos have the singular cusp of the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) or moore profiles or else a profile with a flat core ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "singular profiles like that of nfw are physically motivated by the n - body simulations , and the latter have been used to place these halo profiles empirically in a proper cosmological context which permits statistical predictions for the cdm model .",
    "the nonsingular profiles which have been adopted to contrast with these singular ones , however , are generally no more than parameterized , mathematical fitting formulae , with no particular physical model to motivate them or put them in a proper cosmological context .",
    "we have developed an analytical model for the postcollapse equilibrium structure of virialized objects that condense out of a cosmological background universe , either matter - dominated or flat with a cosmological constant ( @xcite , hereafter paper  i ; @xcite , hereafter paper  ii ) .",
    "this _ truncated isothermal sphere _ , or tis , model assumes that cosmological halos form from the collapse and virialization of `` top - hat '' density perturbations and are spherical , isotropic , and isothermal .",
    "this leads to a unique , nonsingular tis , a particular solution of the lane - emden equation ( suitably modified when @xmath0 ) .",
    "the size @xmath5 and velocity dispersion @xmath6 are unique functions of the mass @xmath7 and formation redshift @xmath8 of the object for a given background universe .",
    "the tis density profile flattens to a constant central value , @xmath9 , which is roughly proportional to the critical density of the universe at the epoch of collapse , with a small core radius @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 and @xmath12 , for the `` king radius '' @xmath13 , defined by @xcite , p. 228 ) .",
    "even though the tis model does not produce the central cusp in the density profile of halos predicted by numerical cdm simulations at very small radii , it does reproduces many of the average properties of these halos quite well , suggesting that it is a useful approximation for the halos which result from more realistic initial conditions ( papers i , ii ; @xcite and references therein ) . in particular",
    ", the tis mass profile agrees well with the fit by nfw to n - body simulations ( i.e. fractional deviation of @xmath14 or less ) at all radii outside of a few tis core radii ( i.e. outside a king radius or so ) .",
    "it also predicts the internal structure of x - ray clusters found by n - body and gasdynamical simulations of cluster formation in the cdm model .",
    "for example , the tis model reproduces to great accuracy the mass - temperature and radius - temperature virial relations and integrated mass profiles derived empirically from the simulations of cluster formation @xcite .",
    "the tis model also successfully reproduces to high precision the mass - velocity dispersion relation for clusters in cdm simulations of the hubble volume by the virgo consortium @xcite , including its dependence on redshift for different background cosmologies .",
    "the tis model also correctly predicts the average value of the virial ratio in n - body simulations of halo formation in cdm .",
    "the tis profile matches the observed mass profiles of dark - matter - dominated dwarf galaxies .",
    "the observed rotation curves of dwarf galaxies are generally well fit by a density profile with a finite density core suggested by @xcite , given by @xmath15    the tis model gives a nearly perfect fit to this profile , with best fit parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , correctly predicting the maximum rotation velocity @xmath18 and the radius @xmath19 at which it occurs .",
    "the tis model can also explain the mass profile with a flat density core measured by @xcite for cluster cl 0024 + 1654 at @xmath20 , using the strong gravitational lensing of background galaxies by the cluster to infer the cluster mass distribution @xcite .",
    "the tis model not only provides a good fit to the projected surface mass density distribution of this cluster within the arcs , but also predicts the overall mass , and a cluster velocity dispersion in close agreement with the value @xmath21 km / s measured by @xcite .",
    "therefore , the tis model can be applied to clusters of galaxies or dark - matter - dominated dwarf galaxies , for which baryonic processes have not significantly modified the mass profile . at the intermediate scale of large galaxies , where the central density profiles may be baryon - dominated , following radiative cooling by the baryon gas , the central profiles may differ from that of the halo of dark matter and baryons which would otherwise form in the absence of radiative losses by the baryonic gas .",
    "the tis model ignores such processes , just as the empirical density profiles ( nfw , moore , @xmath22 ) based on gravity - only n - body simulations do .",
    "hence , these profiles might not be directly applicable to galaxy - scale objects for which the mass profiles have been significantly affected by such baryonic processes .",
    "several authors have studied the effect of lensing by halos with a flat - density core @xcite or by nfw or moore profiles that have been generalized , so that the inner slope of the density profile is arbitrary @xcite .",
    "these particular density profiles are essentially mathematical conveniences without physical motivation .",
    "there is no underlying theoretical model in these cases that was used to predict the value of the core radius or the departure of the inner slope of the density profile from the value found by n - body simulations of cdm .",
    "by contrast , the tis model is based on a set of physical assumptions concerning the origin , evolution , and equilibrium structure of halos in cdm universes .",
    "observations of gravitational lenses have the potential to distinguish between the tis profile and singular ones like the nfw profile , as several observable properties of gravitational lenses will be strongly affected by the presence , or absence of a central cusp in the density profile .",
    "one example of an important observable that can distinguish between various density profiles is the parity of the number of images .",
    "lenses with nonsingular density profiles , such as the tis , obey the _",
    "odd number theorem_. the number of images of a given source is always odd , unless the source is extended and saddles a caustic ( see @xcite , hereafter sef , p.  172 ) . lenses with singular profiles , like the singular isothermal sphere , the nfw profile , or the moore profile , need not obey this theorem , even for point sources .",
    "most observed multiple - image gravitational lenses have either 2 or 4 images , and this may argue against profiles with a central core @xcite .",
    "there are , however , other possible explanations for the absence of a third or fifth image .",
    "that image tends to be very close to the optical axis , and might be hidden behind the lens itself .",
    "also , it is usually highly demagnified , and might be too faint to be seen .",
    "we can use the tis solution to model observed gravitational lenses individually .",
    "alternatively , we can use the observations collectively to constrain the distribution of halo properties as characterized by the tis solution .",
    "these properties , core radius , velocity dispersion , central density , and so on , depend upon the mass of the lensing halos and the redshift at which they form .",
    "observational constraints on the statistical distribution of these properties will , in turn , impose constrains on the cosmological parameters and the primordial power spectrum of density fluctuations .    in this paper",
    ", we derive all the lensing properties of the tis .",
    "we also compare the tis with three other density profiles : the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) density profile , the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , and the schwarzschild lens . to compare the lensing properties of these various lens models , we focus on one particular cosmological model , the currently favored cobe - normalized @xmath23cdm model with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ( this model is also cluster - normalized ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in  2",
    ", we describe the tis density profile and the various comparison profiles . in  3 , we derive the lens equation . in  4 , we compute the critical curves and caustics . in  5 , we study the properties of multiple images : separation , magnification , brightness ratios , and time delay . in  6",
    ", we study the properties of weak lensing , focusing on the average shear . in  7",
    ", we discuss the likelihood of actually observing cases of strong lensing produced by tis halos . summary and conclusion are presented in  8 .",
    "in order to compare the predictions for halo lensing for different halo density profiles , we must relate the parameters which define one profile to those which define another . for this purpose",
    ", we shall assume that all halo profiles contain the same total mass within a sphere of the same radius .",
    "the tis halo is uniquely specified by the central density @xmath9 and core radius @xmath27 .",
    "the tis halo has a well - defined outer radius @xmath5 at which the mass distribution is truncated , enclosing a total mass @xmath28 .",
    "there is a unique dimensionless density profile for the tis if radius and density are expressed in units of @xmath27 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "since the central density @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath29 , the critical density at the epoch of its formation , @xmath8 , it is also possible to specify the profile by the two parameters , total mass and collapse redshift , ( @xmath28 , @xmath8 ) , which is equivalent to specifying the pair ( @xmath27 , @xmath9 ) .",
    "it is customary to define the total mass of other profiles used to model cdm halos as @xmath30 , the mass inside a sphere of radius @xmath31 with a mean density which is 200 times @xmath32 at some redshift @xmath33 . for the sake of direct comparison with the tis profile",
    ", we will fix @xmath30 and @xmath31 for halos of different profiles , which amounts to fixing @xmath28 and @xmath8 for the tis halo , since @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 if @xmath37 .    for the nfw profile",
    ", there is a third parameter , the concentration parameter @xmath38 , which must be specified in addition to the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( or , equivalently , @xmath30 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath38 is not completely independent of the other parameters since there is a statistical expectation that @xmath38 is correlated with @xmath30 and @xmath33 .",
    "however , for any individual halo , @xmath38 is not known a priori .    in what follows",
    ", we will consider two possibilities for comparing our tis lens with other halo lens models .",
    "in the first case , the assumptions will be made that the lens redshift @xmath39 for the tis halo , and the concentration parameter @xmath38 for the nfw halo of the same mass @xmath30 and @xmath31 at that redshift will be the typical value expected from the statistical correlation of @xmath38 with halo mass and the redshift of observation of the halo , @xmath40 . in that case , the halos are fully specified by the values of @xmath30 and @xmath41 . in the second case , we can relax the assumption that @xmath39 .",
    "this makes the tis halo a two - parameter model specified by ( @xmath30 , @xmath8 ) , and it is assumed that the halo which formed at some @xmath42 did not evolve between @xmath8 and @xmath41 . for the comparison nfw halo ,",
    "we take the same @xmath30 and @xmath31 as the tis halo , but allow the concentration parameter @xmath38 to take any value , not necessarily the typical one for a halo of that mass @xmath30 at redshift @xmath41 . in",
    "what follows , we focus primarily on the first of these cases .",
    "this will illustrate the relative expectation of the tis and other profile lenses in a sense which is conservative in regard to the possible strength of the strong lensing effects predicted by the tis halos relative to the others . in our discussion ,",
    " 7 , we will then comment further on the effect of relaxing the assumption that @xmath39 , as discussed above .",
    "the density profile of the tis is obtained numerically by solving a differential equation .",
    "however , it is well - fitted by the following approximation : @xmath43    ( paper  i , ii ) where @xmath9 is a characteristic density , @xmath27 is a characteristic radius , and @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "we will compute the lensing properties of halos with this density profile , and compare them with the properties derived for three comparison profiles . the first one is the navarro , frenk , and white ( nfw ) density profile , @xmath48    where @xmath49 is a characteristic density and",
    "@xmath50 is a characteristic radius .",
    "we will also consider the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) density profile , @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the velocity dispersion and @xmath53 is the gravitational constant .",
    "this model might not represent actual halos very well , but it is a well - studied profile that has important theoretical value .",
    "finally , for completeness , we will also consider the schwarzschild lens , @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the lens mass and @xmath56 is the three - dimensional delta function .    to compare the lensing properties of these various density profiles , we use essentially the same approach as @xcite .",
    "the virial radius @xmath31 of a halo located at redshift @xmath33 is defined , as usual , as being the radius inside which the mean density is equal to 200 times the critical density @xmath57 at that redshift [ where @xmath58 is the hubble parameter ] .",
    "the mass @xmath30 inside that radius is given by @xmath59    when comparing the lensing properties of different density profiles , we will consider halos that are located at the same redshift and have the same value of @xmath31 . by definition",
    ", these halos will also have the same value of @xmath30 . by stretching the terminology",
    ", we will refer to @xmath30 as `` the mass of the halo . ''",
    "this point needs to be discussed .",
    "for the schwarzschild lens , @xmath30 is indeed the mass of the halo .",
    "the sis density profile drops as @xmath60 at large @xmath61 , and the mass therefore diverges unless we introduce a cutoff .",
    "the halo mass will then be equal to @xmath30 only if the cutoff is chosen to be @xmath31 .",
    "the nfw density profile drops as @xmath62 , hence the total mass diverges logarithmically , and this profile also needs a cutoff .",
    "the tis density profile drops asymptotically as @xmath60 , but the tis model includes a cutoff .",
    "this cutoff is located a radius @xmath63 , and the mass inside the cutoff is @xmath64 . in any case , a rigorous definition of the halo mass would require an unambiguous determination of the boundary between the halo and the background matter ( such determination exists only for the tis model ) , as well as dealing with the fact that the assumption of spherical symmetry that enters in these models most likely breaks down for real halos at large enough radii .",
    "treating @xmath30 as being the actual mass of the halo is the best compromise .    for a given halo mass @xmath30 , redshift @xmath33 , and cosmological background model ,",
    "all density profiles are fully determined .",
    "the parameters of the various profiles ( @xmath9 , @xmath27 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath52 , and @xmath55 ) are computed as follows .",
    "first , we compute @xmath31 using equation  ( [ m200 ] ) . the characteristic radius of the tis is then given by @xmath65    ( paper  i ) .",
    "the value @xmath66 is actually valid only for the einstein - de  sitter model , but the dependence upon the cosmological model is rather weak ( paper  ii ) , and for simplicity we shall use the same value for all models .",
    "we now integrate equation  ( [ tisfit ] ) between @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and get @xmath69    where    @xmath70    ( see also @xcite , eq .",

    ", we can eliminate @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and solve for @xmath9 .",
    "we get @xmath71    the characteristic radius of the nfw profile is given by @xmath72     versus halo mass , for nfw halos located at redshifts @xmath73 and 1 , as labeled.,width=317 ]    where @xmath38 is the concentration parameter .",
    "unlike the case for the tis , where @xmath74 is ( nearly ) constant , the concentration parameter of the nfw profile is strongly dependent upon the halo mass , redshift , and cosmological model . to determine @xmath38 for a given halo , we use the formalism of @xcite .",
    "according to this formalism , the concentration parameter in the @xmath23cdm model considered here varies with halo mass for two illustrative values of halo lens redshift @xmath73 and 1.0 as shown in figure  [ ens ] .",

    "but if @xmath275 , then @xmath32 must be evaluated at @xmath8 , instead . by combining equations  ( [ m200 ] ) , ( [ r0 ] ) , ( [ rho0 ] ) , and  ( [ kappac ] ) , and get @xmath276    hence , for a given mass , increasing @xmath8 will result in an increase in @xmath114 , and lensing will be stronger .",
    "similarly , a particular effect ( for instance , production of multiple images , which requires @xmath143 ) can be achieved with a smaller mass halo if that halo collapsed earlier . for the nfw profile , the expressions for the characteristic radius and density , equations  ( [ rnfw ] ) and  ( [ rhonfw ] ) , depend on the concentration parameter @xmath38 .",
    "the models that describe the dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath30 , and @xmath33 @xcite already take into account the difference between @xmath33 and @xmath8 .",
    "hence , unlike the case for the tis , we are not free to set the redshift @xmath33 to any other value than @xmath41 in equation  ( [ rhonfw ] ) .",
    "however , as we explained in  2 , the value of @xmath38 we have used so far , which is a single function of @xmath30 and @xmath41 , is a statistical average over many realizations , and a particular halo might have a different concentration parameter .",
    "let us now focus on the tis , and perform a simple calculation to estimate the probability that a tis can produce multiple images .",
    "to compute @xmath114 , we substitute equations  ( [ m200 ] ) , ( [ r0 ] ) , and ( [ rho0 ] ) in equation  ( [ kappac ] ) . for the particular cosmological model ( @xmath23cdm ) and redshifts ( @xmath137 , @xmath73 , 1.0 ) we have considered in this paper ,",
    "we get @xmath277^{2/3}m_{200}^{1/3 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\left[{\\rho_c(z_{\\rm coll})\\over\\rho_c(z_l)}\\right]^{2/3}m_{15}^{1/3}\\times \\cases{0.968\\,,&$z_l=0.5\\,;$\\cr 1.289\\,,&$z_l=1.0\\,;$\\cr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath278 .",
    "strong lensing requires @xmath143 . if @xmath39 , this condition becomes @xmath279    ( these values are the location of the cutoffs in fig .  [ critfig2 ] ) . for the cosmological model we consider",
    ", a 1-@xmath280 density fluctuation collapsing at redshift @xmath281 ( 1.0 ) has a mass of about @xmath282 ( @xmath283 ) .",
    "such `` typical '' objects will not be capable of producing multiple images of a source at redshift @xmath137 , since the resulting value @xmath284 ( 0.095 ) is smaller than unity .",
    "this simply indicates that multiple images are not produced by the typical objects that collapse at @xmath271 , which is certainly consistent with the fact that fewer than 100 multiple - image systems have been observed .",
    "increasing @xmath114 above unity would require an object about a thousand times more massive than a typical object at the same redshift .",
    "objects of this mass are rare but do exist .",
    "we can make a simple estimate of how atypical such a massive object is . over most of the mass range of cosmological interest ( from small galaxies to clusters of galaxies ) the cdm power spectrum can be roughly approximated by a power law @xmath285 , where @xmath286 is the wavenumber and @xmath287 .",
    "the rms density fluctuation @xmath288 is then given by @xmath289 .",
    "at a given redshift , different values of the wavenumber @xmath286 correspond to different mass scales @xmath7 according to @xmath290 .",
    "the relation between rms density fluctuation and mass scale at fixed epoch is therefore approximated by @xmath291    increasing the mass by a factor of 1000 therefore reduces @xmath288 by a factor of @xmath292 . because of the reduction in @xmath288 , a 1-@xmath280 fluctuation ( @xmath293 ) at this higher mass will no longer collapse by the same redshift ( it will collapse later ) , but a 3-@xmath280 fluctuation ( @xmath294 ) will .",
    "such fluctuations are rare , but not vanishingly rare . in gaussian statistics ,",
    "the probability that a randomly located point in space is inside a 3-@xmath280 density fluctuation ( i.e. @xmath295 ) is 1/384 .",
    "hence , one of every 384 halos would be capable of producing multiple images ( of course , whether any halo actually produces multiple images depends on the location of the sources ) .",
    "this was derived by assuming @xmath271 . as equation  ( [ kappacoll2 ] ) shows , the condition @xmath143 can be satisfied with a smaller mass it we assume that the halo collapsed at an earlier redshift @xmath275 .",
    "a similar calculation could be carried out for the nfw profile . in this case , at fixed mass @xmath30 and redshift @xmath41 , we are free to choose a concentration parameter @xmath38 that differs from the statistical average corresponding to this mass and redshift . if we then combine equations  ( [ rnfw ] ) , ( [ rhonfw ] ) , and ( [ kappas ] ) , and ignore the weak dependence of the denominator of equation  ( [ rhonfw ] ) on @xmath38 at large @xmath38 , we get @xmath296    hence , we can increase the effect of lensing , or reduce the minimum mass necessary to produce a particular effect , by increasing the concentration parameter .    the simple calculations presented in this discussion were for illustration purpose only . in a future paper , we will present a detailed calculation of the expected frequency of multiple image systems for comparison with the statistics of observed lensing .",
    "we have derived the lensing properties of cosmological halos described by the truncated isothermal sphere model .",
    "the solutions depend on the background cosmological model through the critical surface density @xmath110 , which is a function of the cosmological parameters and the source and lens redshifts , and the tis parameters @xmath9 and @xmath27 , which are functions of the mass and collapse redshift of the halo , and the cosmological parameters . by expressing the surface density of the halo in units of @xmath110 and the distances in units of @xmath27 ,",
    "all explicit dependences on the cosmological model disappear , and the solutions are entirely expressible in terms of two dimensionless parameters , the central convergence @xmath114 and the scaled position @xmath177 of the source . we have computed solutions for the critical curves and caustics , the image separations , the magnification and brightness ratios , the shear , and the time delay . the ability of the tis to produce strong lensing ( multiple images and rings ) depends entirely on @xmath114 . if @xmath182 , only one image can form .",
    "if @xmath143 , either one or three images can form , depending on whether the source is located outside or inside the radial caustic .",
    "when three images are produced , the central one is usually very faint , being highly demagnified .",
    "degenerate image configurations occur when an extended source overlaps a caustic .",
    "two images are produced when the source overlaps the radial caustic , while an einstein ring with a central spot is produced when the source overlaps the tangential caustic , which is a single point located at @xmath297 .",
    "these degenerate cases correspond to maxima of the total magnification , which diverges as the source size goes to zero .",
    "when three images are produced , the angular separation between the two outermost images depends strongly on @xmath114 , but only weakly on the source location .    for comparison , we derived ( or extracted from the literature ) the lensing properties of three comparison models : the nfw profile , the singular isothermal sphere , and the schwarzschild lens . unlike the tis , all of these profiles have a central singularity , which allows them to produce multiple images at any mass , provided that the source is sufficiently aligned with the lens . in practice ,",
    "image separations large enough to be resolved can be achieved by galactic - mass objects only for the schwarzschild lens , and by supergalactic - mass objects for all profiles .",
    "this paper focused on the intrinsic properties of individual lenses described by the tis model and the comparison models .",
    "it provides all the necessary formulae one needs to study gravitational lensing by the tis , and the comparison profiles , in specific cosmological models .",
    "we will present such studies in forthcoming papers . as an illustration here",
    ", we applied the tis model to the currently - favored @xmath23cdm universe , to calculate the central convergence @xmath114 expected for tis halos of different masses and collapse epochs .",
    "we found that high - redshift sources ( e.g. @xmath298 ) will be strongly lensed by tis halos ( i.e. @xmath143 ) only for cluster - mass halos , assuming that these halos formed at the redshift they are observed . as equation  ( [ kappacoll2 ] ) shows , the halo mass required for strong lensing can be decreased by increasing the formation redshift of the halo .",
    "an example of a lens for which @xmath275 is discussed by @xcite , who showed that the mass - model derived by @xcite to explain their lensing data for cluster cl 0024 + 1654 at @xmath20 is very well - fit by a tis halo with @xmath299 and @xmath300 .",
    "this central density implies that the halo collapse redshift is @xmath301 ( i.e. @xmath302 ) .",
