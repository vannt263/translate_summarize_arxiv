    "recently , a finite @xmath0 physics for half - bps operators in @xmath5 super yang - mills with @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge groups have been studied@xcite in the same spirit as finite physics for @xmath3 was studied in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors realized that schur operators ( in the square of the eigenvalues ) also diagonalized the free field two - point function for orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups .",
    "this was surprising .",
    "it is not obvious that schur operators should form an orthogonal basis for @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge groups , since wick contractions for these groups are completely different from the unitary case .",
    "+ in this work we solve this puzzle by showing how schur operators are naturally singled out as an orthogonal basis for classical gauge groups by the embedding structure of the lie algebras .",
    "this way , the orthogonality of schur operators should not be thought as associated to a specific gauge group but to a more essential embedding structure that classical algebras share . in other words , orthogonality of schurs is a gauge group - independent property .",
    "these statements rely on the two main results of this paper : first , the compatibility of weingarten calculus @xcite with wick calculus , explicitly expressed in equation ( [ compatibility ] ) ; second , a ` hidden ' property of schur operators , which turn out to be a non - degenerate set of eigenvectors of self - adjoint operators naturally constructed from the embedding structure of the algebras ( equation ( [ eigenvectors ] ) ) . actually , this last property is intrinsic to schur polynomials , it can be found right from the context of symmetric functions@xcite .",
    "+ according to ads / cft duality@xcite , we can learn string physics from studying the dual gauge theory , we just need the appropriate dictionary .",
    "in general , for a gauge group @xmath6 in the the gauge theory , the limit @xmath7 corresponds to supergravity solutions on the string side . for finite @xmath0",
    ", probing physics of the gauge theory@xcite corresponds to studying non - perturbative objects such as giant gravitons@xcite , as well as aspects of spacetime geometry captured in the stringy exclusion principle@xcite .",
    "+ it is known that different gauge groups in @xmath5 super yang - mills correspond to different geometries in which the string theory lives .",
    "for @xmath3 it is known that the corresponding background is @xmath8",
    "@xcite , while for @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge groups the cft is dual to @xmath9 geometry@xcite . unlike string physics in @xmath8 , strings in the orbifold @xmath9 are non - oriented . from this fact one expects the study of non - perturbative stringy physics in the orbifold to bring new insights@xcite , and they are captured by the finite @xmath0 physics of the cft with gauge groups @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this was one of the motivations for the study of finite @xmath0 physics of orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups in @xcite .",
    "+ the programme of studying finite @xmath0 physics in the case of unitary groups was initiated in @xcite for half - bps operators , that is , for operators built on a single complex matrix .",
    "they showed that half - bps operators can be described by schur operators and they demonstrated that schur operators diagonalize the free field two - point function .",
    "there has been a considerable progress on the study of finite @xmath0 physics for @xmath3 gauge groups and , by now , we know a number of bases that diagonalize the free field two - point function@xcite .",
    "orthogonal operators for the @xmath10 sector of the theory , which involves gauge fields and their derivatives , and the action of the dilatation operator on them has been studied in @xcite .",
    "fermion together with boson fields have been treated in @xcite , where an orthogonal restricted schur basis for the whole @xmath11-bps sector was found and the action of the dilatation operator on them described .",
    "we also know how to diagonalize the one - loop dilatation operator@xcite for certain ( large ) operators dual to giant gravitons@xcite .",
    "the diagonalization of the one - loop dilatation operator has provided new integrable sectors in the non - planar regime , with the spectrum of the dilatation operator reduced to that of decoupled harmonic oscillators which describe the excitations of strings attached to giants@xcite .",
    "+ the programme of studying finite @xmath0 physics in the case of orthogonal and symplectic groups was initiated in @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the planar spectral problem of @xmath5 super yang - mills with gauge groups so(n ) and sp(n ) was carried out in @xcite . in order to tackle the non - planar regime in future works , exact correlators of an orthogonal basis of half - bps operators",
    "have been recently found in @xcite . among other things",
    ", @xcite showed that for @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge groups schur operators ( although in the square of their eigenvalues ) form a basis of half - bps operators and diagonalize the free field two - point function .",
    "as in the case of @xmath3 , their correlators were found to be given by nice ( but different ) combinatorial functions . in this paper we will call them @xmath12 , using a unified notation , where @xmath13 stands for the gauge groups @xmath14 , @xmath15 or @xmath16 . + as said above , it was unexpected to find an orthogonal basis of schurs for @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge groups since wick contractions behave differently from the @xmath3 case .",
    "this paper solves the question of why schur operators diagonalize the free field two - point function for classical gauge groups .",
    "we show how the underlying structure of embedding algebras , common to all classical lie algebras , naturally singles out schurs as an orthogonal basis of half - bps gauge invariant operators .",
    "half - bps gauge invariant operators for any gauge group @xmath6 are built on an element ( a complex matrix ) @xmath17 .",
    "we want to emphasize that orthogonality of schur operators is not linked to the particular gauge group we are considering but to the embedding properties of the algebras , that is , the way @xmath4 .",
    "+ the starting point is the infinite chain of embedding algebras @xmath18 this embedding has to be understood as follows . for @xmath19 , an element @xmath17 can be embedded in @xmath20 by placing @xmath21 in the upper left part of a matrix and fill the rest of the matrix , till dimension @xmath22 , with 0 s . one can easily check that the @xmath22-dimensional matrix so constructed is an element of @xmath20 , for @xmath23 a classical lie algebra .",
    "+ the next step is to design the most basic nontrivial set of operators that adapt to this structure . with this purpose",
    "we may define @xmath24 as operators which act on any @xmath25 by killing the ` extra ' 0 s and lowering the dimension of the matrix to @xmath0 . in the case that @xmath25 has more than @xmath0 eigenvalues different from 0",
    ", @xmath24 takes it to @xmath26 matrix .",
    "+ we may easily extend the definition of @xmath24 to act on gauge invariant operators .",
    "we will make @xmath24 act on every @xmath21 of the composite operators as above . this way , @xmath24 is a map that takes gauge invariant operators built on @xmath27 to gauge invariant operators built on @xmath17 .",
    "+ at this stage and by virtue of the operator - state one - to - one correspondence in conformal field theories , it is useful to think of gauge invariant operators built on @xmath17 as vectors belonging to a vector space @xmath28 . then @xmath29 , and the free field two - point function is an inner product defined in each @xmath28 .",
    "now , each operator @xmath24 must have an adjoint operator with respect to the inner products .",
    "we will call @xmath30 the adjoint operator of @xmath24 .",
    "they are constructed in section [ main ] by integrating over the gauge group the adjoint action of the gauge group onto the algebra .",
    "+ once we have a set of operators and their adjoints we can construct a set of self - adjoint operators by composition .",
    "operators @xmath31 are maps between gauge invariant operators built on @xmath17 .",
    "it turns out that the eigenvectors @xmath31 are schurs and their eigenvalues are all different .",
    "it follows immediately that schurs are an orthogonal set of gauge invariant operators built on @xmath17 , for all @xmath0 , with respect to the two - point function .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ mathpre ] aims to set the notation and to collect the mathematical tools necessary to follow the calculations .",
    "the notation we use in this work is slightly different from the notation used in previous papers .",
    "basically , since most of the expressions relate objects with different rank of the gauge group we must specify it .",
    "so , changes in notation are mainly additions of a label for the rank parameter .",
    "the name ` schurs ' for our operators and the notation we use for them in all classical groups is justified in subsection [ schurs ] by showing that the operators are actually schur polynomials in the eigenvalues of @xmath21 ( for unitary groups ) or in the square of its eigenvalues ( for orthogonal and symplectic groups ) .",
    "+ our calculations for the unitary groups reduce at the end of the day to sums of characters of the symmetric group @xmath32 and their associated schur polynomials . in the orthogonal and symplectic cases the relevant symmetries of the correlators are no longer those of class functions but of constant functions on the double coset of @xmath33 .",
    "they are generically called spherical functions and their associated symmetric polynomials go under the name of zonal polynomials .",
    "they play an analogous role for orthogonal and symplectic groups as characters and schur polynomials do for the unitary cases . in subsection",
    "[ sf ] we enter this analysis of symmetries to motivate the framework when we deal with each gauge group .",
    "we also collect some standard definitions and results ( mainly from @xcite ) which will be needed later on .",
    "+ combinatorial functions @xmath34 which were found in @xcite for unitary gauge groups and in @xcite for orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups can be expressed as specific symmetric polynomials when evaluated at 1 in all the variables .",
    "we will need these definitions in section [ main ] to state and prove the main results of the paper .",
    "so , we devote subsection [ frfunctions ] for this purpose .",
    "+ the computation of the averaging operator acting on a gauge invariant operator involves integrals of matrix entries over gauge groups .",
    "these integrals have been computed for classical gauge groups and for finite @xmath0 over the last decade .",
    "the method to compute them was named weingarten calculus after the paper @xcite and the functions involved weingarten functions .",
    "we collect them in subsection [ wgfunctions ]",
    ". + section [ main ] contains the main results of the paper , which are equations ( [ compatibility ] ) and ( [ eigenvectors ] ) . in subsection [ gm ]",
    "we flesh out the general method we have sketched in this introduction and discuss till which extend we can recover the two - point function of schurs from ( [ compatibility ] ) and ( [ eigenvectors ] ) . in the subsequent subsections we just prove ( [ compatibility ] ) and ( [ eigenvectors ] ) for each gauge group .",
    "+ finally , we summarize the results of the paper and outline some ideas for future works in section [ con ] .",
    "although the mathematical context for operators and correlators of unitary groups is known we find it convenient to review it together with the other groups in order to point out their analogies .",
    "this helps in the purpose of finding a broader and unifying framework .",
    "the notation we will be using along this paper suffers little modifications and some additions as compared to previous physics papers on the matter .",
    "the main changes are explained in this subsection .",
    "+ for all the groups and through all this paper we will reserve @xmath35 to denote the number of fields in a given operator , and @xmath0 or @xmath22 for the ranks of the gauge groups . because we are interested in comparing correlators with different gauge group",
    "ranks we are forced to make ranks explicit . in the case of traces , we will change @xmath36 to indicate that the indices which are traced run from @xmath37 . for operators we will also need to specify the rank of the group .",
    "so , for schur operators we will change @xmath38 besides , since the orthogonal basis of operators found in @xcite and @xcite are also schur polynomials ( in the square of the eigenvalues ) for the orthogonal and symplectic groups , we will refer to them as @xmath39 correlators of schurs are given by the combinatorial functions @xmath40 , see ( [ frs ] ) . for them , we will also need to specify the group , so we will write @xmath41 the usual short hand notation for tensors will be profusely used along the calculations . we will call @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the orthogonal and symplectic cases we will use the short hand notation @xmath44 and also @xmath45 for symmetric functions it will often be the case that we need their value when all the variables are equal to one . in this case",
    "we will write @xmath46      the name of ` schur operators ' for the orthogonal basis of operators found in @xcite in the case of unitary groups , and in @xcite for orthogonal and symplectic groups , is justified because the operators are actually schur polynomials whose variables are the eigenvalues of the element of the algebra @xmath47 that builds the operator .",
    "+ let us first see how it works for unitary groups .",
    "gauge invariant operators built from @xmath21 s are easily seen to be symmetric functions in the eigenvalues of @xmath21 .",
    "since @xmath48 is a basis - invariant operation , we can choose a basis of eigenvectors of @xmath21 and see that @xmath49 although schur polynomials can be constructed in different ways , we find convenient to write them in association with characters by the relation @xmath50 thus @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the eigenvalues of @xmath21 .",
    "+ for the orthogonal and symplectic algebras , an orthogonal basis of operators was found in @xcite to be @xmath53 using the invariance of @xmath48 under change of basis we can write @xmath54 for @xmath55 . in the case of",
    "@xmath0 odd , for @xmath55 we just have to add a 0 eigenvalue .",
    "for all these algebras , @xmath56 is diagonal in the square of their eigenvalues .",
    "it is easy to see that for @xmath0 even a multitrace monomial can be expressed in terms of symmetric power sums as @xmath57 and if @xmath55 with @xmath0 odd @xmath58 so , our operators read @xmath59 this means that , up to an irrelevant global minus factor , the operators @xmath60 are actually schur polynomials in their eigenvalues .",
    "this justifies the name and the notation .",
    "the mathematics which appear in our calculations involve broad and quite developed fields .",
    "a complete introduction to them is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "instead , we will offer some intuitive justification of the functions and polynomials involved for each gauge group and the necessary formulae and definitions to follow the calculations .",
    "we will give some references where the interested reader can find a full description .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    when we work on the unitary case , say @xmath61 , a general monomial multitrace operator with @xmath35 fields @xmath62 depends only on the cycle structure of @xmath63 .",
    "so , every element in the conjugate class of @xmath63 will lead to the same operator .",
    "for this reason , the functions that appear in the unitary context are class functions , for which the characters are a standard basis . for example , correlators @xmath64 are manifestly class functions on the elements @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , correlators can be expanded in terms of characters of @xmath32 , in fact @xmath66 note that , except for the value of @xmath67 , formula ( [ expandu ] ) could be almost guessed by symmetry considerations .",
    "+ other class functions that often appear in the unitary case are traces , and they also can be expanded in terms of characters as @xmath68 we can associate symmetric polynomials to functions on the symmetric group .",
    "characters are associated with schur polynomials by relation ( [ defschur ] ) .",
    "+ later , we will need the value of schur polynomials when all the variables are equal to 1 since they are related to the combinatorial functions @xmath69 , see ( [ fru ] ) .",

    "this forces any trace within a multitrace monomial to have an even number of fields .",
    "clearly the monomials @xmath72 generate all half - bps multitrace gauge invariant operators .",
    "monomials ( [ monomialz2 ] ) resemble the shape of multitrace monomials for unitary groups as we change @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "one might be tempted to establish some relations between orthogonal and unitary groups upon this fact .",
    "for example , one can argue that correlators @xmath75 are class functions of @xmath63 and @xmath76 and may be expanded in terms of characters of @xmath77 .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "however , as soon as we try to flesh it out and compute any correlator it turns out that wick contractions act on elements of the algebra , and @xmath56 is neither an element of @xmath78 nor an element of @xmath79 .",
    "the same happens when we try to implement weingarten calculus , as we are doing later on . in the latter case",
    ", it happens that the adjoint action of the group is defined on the algebra , and again , @xmath56 is not an element of the algebra .",
    "+ then , it is convenient to write ( [ monomialz2 ] ) in a different way .",

    "moreover , we construct a set of self - adjoint operators by composition of them in ( [ composition ] ) and calculate their eigenvectors and eigenvalues in ( [ eigenvectors ] ) .",
    "it turns out that their eigenvectors are schur operators whose eigenvalues are all different .",
    "from there , we conclude that schur operators form an orthogonal set . + to actually say",
    "that schur operators form a basis of half - bps gauge invariant operators we must either evaluate the partition function and match the counting , or prove that orthogonal schurs generate all gauge invariant operators .",
    "if we assume that all gauge invariant operators are linear combinations of multitrace monomials it is easy to see that schur operators form a basis .",
    "we should think of gauge invariant operators as symmetric polynomials in the eigenvalues of @xmath21 .",
    "then the relation between symmetric polynomials @xmath215 which is the inversion of ( [ defschur ] ) , tells us that all multitrace monomials can be expressed in terms of schurs , and so schurs generate all gauge invariant operators .",
