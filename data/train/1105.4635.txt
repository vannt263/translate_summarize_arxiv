    "a number of earth- , balloon- , and satellite - based experiments have observed anomalies in the spectra of cosmic ray electrons and positrons .",

    "@xcite have measured an excess in the flux of electrons and positrons up to , and beyond @xmath0  tev , respectively .",
    "pamela  @xcite , which is sensitive to electrons and positrons up to a few hundred gev in energy , detects an upturn in the positron fraction beginning around 7 gev , in disagreement with the expected decline from secondary production mechanisms .",
    "recent measurements at fermi - lat support this result  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , current experiments observe no excess in the proton or antiproton flux  @xcite .",
    "although astrophysical explanations are possible  @xcite , these observations can be explained if the data includes a contribution from the decays of unstable dark matter particles that populate the galactic halo  @xcite .",
    "the dark matter candidate must be tev - scale in mass , have a lifetime of order @xmath1  seconds , and decay preferentially to leptons .",
    "a number of scenarios have been proposed to explain the desired dark matter lifetime and decay properties  @xcite .    to be more quantitative ,",
    "consider a scalar dark matter candidate @xmath2 which ( after the breaking of all relevant gauge symmetries ) has an effective coupling @xmath3 to some standard model fermion @xmath4 given by @xmath5 to obtain a lifetime of @xmath1  seconds , one finds @xmath6 if @xmath7  tev . from the perspective of naturalness ,",
    "the origin of such a small dimensionless number requires an explanation .",
    "one possibility is that physics near the dark matter mass scale is entirely responsible for the appearance of a small number , as is the case in models where a global symmetry , that would otherwise stabilize the dark matter candidate , is broken by instanton effects of a new non - abelian gauge group @xmath8 . a leptophilic model of fermionic dark matter along these lines",
    "was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite : the new gauge group is broken not far above the dark matter mass scale and the effective coupling is exponentially suppressed , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the @xmath8 gauge coupling .",
    "( an example of a supersymmetric model with anomaly - induced dark matter decays can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) on the other hand , the appearance of a small effective coupling can arise if the breaking of the stabilizing symmetry is communicated to the dark matter via higher - dimension operators suppressed by some high scale @xmath11 .",
    "then it is possible that @xmath3 is suppressed by @xmath12 , for some power @xmath13 ; it is well known that for @xmath14  tev and @xmath15 , the correct lifetime can be obtained for @xmath16  gev , remarkably coincident with the grand unification ( gut ) scale in models with tev - scale supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite .",
    "if the lhc fails to find susy in the coming years , however , then the association of @xmath17  gev with a fundamental mass scale will no longer be strongly preferred .",
    "exploring other alternatives is well motivated from this perspective and , in any event , may provide valuable insight into the range of possible decaying dark matter scenarios .",
    "the very naive estimate for @xmath3 discussed above presumes that the result is determined by a tev - scale dark matter mass @xmath18 , a single high scale @xmath11 and no small dimensionless factors .",
    "given these assumption , the choice @xmath19 , where @xmath20  gev is the reduced planck mass , would not be viable : the dark matter decay rate is much too large for @xmath21 ( _ i.e. _ , there would be no dark matter left at the present epoch ) and is much too small for @xmath15 ( _ i.e. _ , there would not be enough events to explain the cosmic ray @xmath22 excess ) . however , planck - suppressed effects arise so generically that we should be careful not to discount them too quickly .",
    "what we show in the present paper is that planck - suppressed operators can lead to the desired dark matter lifetime if they correct new physics at an intermediate scale . in the model that we present ,",
    "this is the scale at which yukawa couplings of the standard model charged leptons are generated via the integrating out of vector - like states .",
    "this sector will have the structure of a froggatt - nielsen model  @xcite : an abelian discrete symmetry will restrict the couplings of the standard model leptons and the vector - like states , but will be spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of a set of scalar fields @xmath23 . integrating out the heavy states will not only lead to the standard model charged lepton yukawa couplings , but also to dark matter couplings that are naturally leptophilic and lead to dark matter decay . aside from setting the overall scale of the charged lepton masses , the symmetry structure of our model will not restrict the detailed textures of the standard model yukawa matrices .",
    "this feature is not automatic ; symmetries introduced to guarantee dark matter leptophilia may also make it difficult to obtain the correct lepton mass matrices , at least without additional theoretical assumptions ( for example , the addition of electroweak higgs triplets , as in the model of ref .",
    "our framework is free of such complications and is compatible , in principle , with many possible extensions that might address the full flavor structure of the standard model .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we present a model that illustrates our proposal . in section  3 ,",
    "we compute the predicted @xmath22 flux , @xmath24 , and the positron fraction @xmath25 $ ] for some points in the parameter space of our model and compare our results to the relevant cosmic ray data .",
    "it is worth noting that this analysis has applicability to any model that leads to similar dark matter decay operators . in section  4 ,",
    "we comment on the relic density and dark matter direct detection in our example model . in section  5 ,",
    "we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we assume that the right - handed charged leptons of the standard model , @xmath26 , and four sets of heavy vector - like charged leptons are constrained by the discrete symmetry @xmath27 with @xmath13 and @xmath28 to be determined shortly .",
    "we assume that the vector - like leptons have the same electroweak quantum numbers as @xmath26 @xmath29 all the fields shown are assumed to be triplets in generation space , with their generation indices suppressed . under the discrete symmetry , the fields in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eee ] ) are taken to transform as @xmath30 @xmath31 we will take @xmath32 and @xmath33 to be elements of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , we assume the presence of a heavy right - handed neutrino , @xmath38 , that is a singlet under @xmath39 .",
    "we note that the fields that are charged under @xmath39 do not transform under any of the non - abelian standard model gauge group factors , so that @xmath39 satisfies the consistency conditions of a discrete gauge symmetry in the low - energy theory  @xcite ; such discrete symmetries are not violated by quantum gravitational effects must vanish , as is automatic above .",
    "@xcite indicates that no rigorous proof exists that the cancellation of the linear gravitational anomalies is a necessary condition for the consistency of the low - energy theory .",
    "nonetheless , such a cancellation can be achieved here by including a singlet , left - handed fermion , @xmath40 , that transforms in the same way as @xmath26 under @xmath39 . for the choice @xmath41 , adopted later in this section",
    ", @xmath40 can develop a majorana mass somewhat below @xmath42 and decay rapidly to lighter states via planck - suppressed operators .",
    "including such a state does not affect the phenomenology of the model otherwise . ] .",
    "the yukawa couplings of the standard model charged leptons arise when the symmetry @xmath39 is spontaneously broken and the vector - like leptons are integrated out of the theory .",
    "symmetry breaking is accomplished via the vacuum expectation values of two scalar fields @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which transform as @xmath45 the following renormalizable lagrangian terms involving the charged lepton fields are allowed by the discrete symmetry : @xmath46 while it is not our goal to produce a theory of flavor , we note that the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : esector ] ) are of the type one expects in flavor models based on the froggatt - nielsen mechanism . hence , integrating out the @xmath47 fields leads to a higher - dimension operator @xmath48 which provides an origin for the charged lepton yukawa couplings .",
    "choosing @xmath49 gives the correct scale for the tau lepton yukawa coupling ; the smaller , electron and muon yukawa couplings may be accommodated by suitable choices of the undetermined couplings in eq .",
    "( [ eq : esector ] ) .",
    "one might imagine that the remaining yukawa hierarchies could be arranged by the imposition of additional symmetries , though we will not explore that possibility here .",
    "we now introduce our dark matter candidate @xmath2 , a complex scalar field that transforms as @xmath50 under @xmath51 .",
    "we assume that all the nonvanishing powers of @xmath32 and @xmath33 shown in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : charges1 ] ) , ( [ eq : charges2 ] ) and ( [ eq : chicharges ] ) are nontrivial , which requires that @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    ". then , there are no renormalizable interactions involving a single @xmath2 field ( or its conjugate ) and two fermionic fields that could lead to dark matter decay . however ,",
    "non - renormalizable , planck - suppressed operator provide the desired effect .",
    "the lowest - order , planck - suppressed correction to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : esector ] ) that involves a single @xmath2 field is the unique dimension - six operator @xmath54 including eq .",
    "( [ eq : d6ope ] ) and again integrating out the heavy , vector - like states , one obtains a new higher - dimension operator , @xmath55 which leads to dark matter decay . for @xmath7  tev ( compatible qualitatively with fits to the pamela and fermi - lat data ) , a lifetime of @xmath1 seconds is obtained when @xmath56 for our operator expansion to be sensible , we require @xmath57 ; however , we also do not want a proliferation of wildly dissimilar physical scales , if this can be avoided .",
    "interestingly , if we choose @xmath11 to be the geometric mean of @xmath58 and @xmath42 , one finds @xmath59 which meets our aesthetic requirements .",
    "standard model quark and neutral lepton masses are unaffected by the discrete symmetry of our model , by construction .",
    "light neutrino masses arise via a conventional see - saw mechanism , and it is possible to obtain a right - handed neutrino mass scale @xmath60 , so that all the heavy leptons appear at a comparable scale . assuming that the largest neutrino squared mass is comparable to @xmath61  ev@xmath62 , as suggested by atmospheric neutrino oscillations  @xcite , then this possibility is obtained if the overall scale of the yukawa coupling matrix that appears in the neutrino dirac mass term is of the same order as the charm quark yukawa coupling .",
    "this scenario is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : scales ] . in this case , the theory is characterized by three fundamental scales : the planck scale , an intermediate scale ( associated with charged lepton flavor and right - handed neutrino masses ) , and the tev - scale .",
    "symmetry - breaking vevs appear within a factor of @xmath63 below the latter two .",
    "of course , the right - handed neutrino scale need not be linked with the scale at which the charged lepton yukawa couplings are generated ; this is simply one of many viable possibilities that depend on choices of the free parameters of the model .",
    "finally , we return to the discrete symmetry group @xmath64 . we have noted that the structure of the theory that we have described is obtained for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , but this does not take into account an important additional constraint : there must be no planck - suppressed operators involving couplings between the various scalar fields in the theory that can lead to other dark matter decay channels that are either ( i ) too fast or ( ii ) too hadronic .",
    "for example , the choice @xmath65 and @xmath66 , allows the renormalizable @xmath39-invariant operator @xmath67 , which leads to mixing , for example , between the @xmath2 and @xmath43 fields ; the latter couples to two standard model leptons via the operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chlep ] ) , leading to a disastrously large decay rate .",
    "we find that all unwanted operators are sufficiently suppressed if we take @xmath41 and @xmath68 , that is @xmath69 the lowest - order combination of scalar fields that is invariant under @xmath70 , as well as the standard model gauge group , is @xmath71 suppression by _ three _ factors of the planck scale is more than sufficient to suppress any operators that are generated when the @xmath43 and @xmath44 fields are integrated out of the theory , or that may be constructed from products of eq .",
    "( [ eq : thecombo ] ) with any @xmath70-singlet , gauge - invariant combination of standard model fields .",
    "it is straightforward to confirm that the alternative choice @xmath72 is also viable , by similar arguments .",
    "the difference between the symmetry groups @xmath70 and @xmath73 is that the former allows two types of dark matter mass terms : @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "this leads to a mass splitting between the two real scalar components of @xmath2 , so that the lighter is the dark matter candidate .",
    "the choice @xmath73 forbids the @xmath76 mass terms , so that the dark matter consists of particles and anti - particles associated with the original complex scalar field .",
    "we note that in this theory , the renormalizable interactions involving @xmath2 have an accidental u(1)@xmath77 global symmetry which would lead to dark matter stability in the absence of the planck - suppressed effects .",
    "the analysis that we present in the following sections is somewhat simplified by the choice of @xmath73 , which we adopt henceforth .",
    "in this section , we investigate the cosmic ray @xmath22 and proton / antiproton spectra of our model .",
    "our treatment of cosmic ray propagation follows that of ref .",
    "we show that model parameters may be chosen to accommodate the positron excess and the rising electron - positron flux observed by the pamela and fermi - lat experiments , respectively .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : newop ] ) , we identified the operator responsible for dark matter decays .",
    "more explicitly , this operator may be written @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are generation indices , and @xmath81 represents unknown order - one coefficients .",
    "different choices for the couplings @xmath81 will lead , in principle , to different cosmic ray spectra . to simplify the analysis ,",
    "we focus on two possibilities : in the lepton mass eigenstate basis , the fermions appearing in the decay operators are either ( _ i _ ) muons exclusively , or ( _ ii _ ) taus exclusively",
    ". we will find that either of these choices is consistent with the data , even though we have not fully exploited the parametric freedom available in the @xmath81 .",
    "this is sufficient to demonstrate the viability of our model .",
    "the remaining factors in the operator coefficient are chosen to obtain the desired dark matter lifetime , as we discussed in the previous section .    in unitary gauge , the operator ( [ eq : opagain ] )",

    "the term proportional to the higgs vev leads to the two - body decay @xmath87 , for @xmath88 or @xmath89 , while the remaining term contributes to @xmath90 .",

    "one should keep in mind that the physics responsible for dark matter annihilations is not directly linked to the mechanism that we have proposed to account for dark matter decay ; other contributions to the total annihilation cross section can easily be arranged .",
    "for example , if the higgs sector includes mixing with a gauge singlet scalar @xmath212 such that there is a scalar mass eigenstate near @xmath213 , then the annihilation through the @xmath214-channel exchange of this state can lead to a resonantly enhanced annihilation channel , as in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    ", the correct relic density could be obtained for smaller @xmath215 than the values quoted above .    finally , we confirm that the model does not conflict with bounds from searches for dark matter - nuclear recoil . in this case ,",
    "the most relevant contribution comes from the interaction between the dark matter and quarks mediated by a @xmath178-channel higgs exchange .",
    "the effective lagrangian is given by @xmath216 following refs  @xcite ,",
    "we can write an effective interaction between the nucleons and dark matter , @xmath217 where @xmath218 , for @xmath219 or @xmath220 . the coefficient @xmath221 can be evaluated using the results of ref .",
    "@xcite ; numerically , one finds @xmath222 with @xmath223 .",
    "given the effective dark matter - nucleon interaction , we find that the spin - independent cross section is given by @xmath224 for both of the cases discussed earlier , @xmath225 and @xmath226 , we find @xmath227 .",
    "this is two orders of magnitude smaller than the strongest bounds , from cdms  @xcite , which range from @xmath228  cm@xmath62 at @xmath230  tev to @xmath231  cm@xmath62 at @xmath232  tev .",
    "models of decaying dark matter require a plausible origin for the higher - dimension operators that lead to dark matter decays .",
    "the data from cosmic ray experiments like pamela and fermi - lat require that these operators involve lepton fields preferentially .",
    "we have shown how the desired higher - dimension operators may originate from planck - suppressed couplings between a tev - scale scalar dark matter particle @xmath2 and vector - like states at a mass scale @xmath11 that is intermediate between the weak and planck scales .",
    "the vector - like sector has the structure of a froggatt - nielsen model : charged lepton yukawa couplings arise only after these states are integrated out and a discrete gauged abelian flavor symmetry is broken .",
    "couplings between @xmath2 and the standard model gauge - invariant combination @xmath233 are then also generated , with coefficients of order @xmath234 , where @xmath235 is the scale at which the flavor symmetry is broken .",
    "taking @xmath11 and @xmath235 near the geometric mean of the reduced planck scale and the weak scale , @xmath236  gev , leads to the desired dark matter lifetime .",
    "neutrino masses can be generated via a conventional see - saw mechanism with the mass scale of right - handed neutrinos also near @xmath11 .",
    "we pointed out that the symmetry structure of our model leads to an overall suppression factor multiplying the charged lepton yukawa matrix , but does not constrain the standard model yukawa textures otherwise .",
    "hence , our framework is potentially compatible with a wide range of possible solutions to the more general problem of quark and lepton flavor in the standard model .",
    "we presented the necessary pythia simulations to confirm that our model can account for the anomalies observed in the cosmic ray experiments discussed earlier .",
    "the leading contribution to the primary cosmic ray electron and positron flux in our model comes from two - body decays , in which the higgs field is set equal to its vev in the operator described above ; the subleading three body decays , @xmath237 , are also possible .",
    "we have checked that these decay channels do not lead to an observable excess in the spectrum of cosmic ray antiprotons , since the cosmic ray antiproton flux is in agreement with astrophysical predictions .",
    "our model demonstrates that the desired lifetime and decay channels of tev - scale scalar dark matter candidate can be the consequence of renormalizable physics at an intermediate lepton flavor scale and gravitational physics at @xmath42 .",
    "this presents an alternative scenario to the one in which dark matter decay is a consequence of physics at a unification scale located somewhere between @xmath11 and @xmath42 .",
