    "alferov @xcite , et al . , proposed creating semiconductor - based lasers comprising the use of a geometrically - narrow active recombination region where photon generation occurs , with waveguides around improving the gain to loss ratio ( separate confinement heterostructures ; sch ) . that idea dominated largely the field of optoelectronics development in the past years . due to the relative simplicity and perfection of technology , solid solutions of @xmath4",
    "are commonly used as wide - gap semiconductors in sch lasers .    reaching the threshold current density of these lasers less",
    "than @xmath5 at room temperature has opened up prospects for their practical application and served as a turning point in their production .",
    "now , they are mostly used for pumping solid state @xmath6 lasers , either for high - power metallurgical processes or , already , in first field experiments as a highly directional source of energy in weapons interceptors .",
    "further progress in that direction is associated with optimizing the design of laser diodes and , in particular , in improving their optical efficiency as well finding methods of removing excess heating released .    in our earlier works",
    "we first were able to find agreement between our calculations of quantum well energy states and the lasing wavelength observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "next @xcite , we have shown how to considerably improve their electrical and optical parameters by finding the most optimal qw width and waveguides widths , and type and level of doping @xcite .",
    "we compared computed properties with these of lasers produced by polyus research institute in moscow @xcite , @xcite . by changing the waveguide profile through introducing a gradual change of al concentration , as well variable doping profiles",
    ", we were able to decrease significantly the lasing threshold current , increase the slope of optical power versus current , and increase optical efficiency .",
    "we have shown also @xcite that the lasing action may not occur at certain widths or depths of quantum well ( qw ) , and the threshold current as a function of these parameters may have discontinuities that occur when the most upper quantum well energy values are very close to either conduction band or valence band energy offsets .",
    "these effects are more pronounced at low temperatures , and may be observed also , at certain conditions , in temperature dependence of lasing threshold current as well .",
    "one of the fundamental laser characteristics is their optical efficiency , @xmath1 , the ratio of optical power generated , @xmath7 , to electrical power supplied , @xmath8 , as well dependence of @xmath1 on current or voltage . we propose here a simple analytical , phenomenological model for description of @xmath0 characteristics near and above lasing offset voltage @xmath9 , and we show that that model may be used for description of @xmath3 with a high accuracy . at the same time",
    "we obtain a link between differential electrical resistivity @xmath2 just above @xmath9 , with the functional @xmath3 dependence , where @xmath10 is also an important experimental characteristic of a laser device .    for simulations , we use sentaurus tcad from synopsys @xcite , which is an advanced commercial computational environment , a collection of tools for performing modeling of electronic devices .",
    "we model a laser with @xmath11 cavity length and @xmath12 width , with doping / al - content as described in table [ table_1 ] .",
    "synopsys s sentaurus tcad is a flexible set of tools used for modeling a broad range of technological and physical processes in the world of microelectronics phenomena .",
    "it can be run on windows and linux os .",
    "linux , once mastered , offers more ways of an efficient solving of problems by providing a large set of open source tools and ergonomic environment for their use , making it our preferred operating system .",
    "we find it convenient , for instance , to use perl scripting language for control of batch processing and changing parameters of calculations as well for manipulation on text data files , and tcl for manipulating ( extracting ) spacial data from binary @xmath13 files .",
    "a detailed description , with examples of scripts , is available on our laboratory web site .    the results for @xmath14 and @xmath15 , in this paper ,",
    "are all shown normalized by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , which are the values of @xmath14 and @xmath18 computed for the reference laser described in table [ table_1 ] .",
    "we neglect here the effect of contact resistance , @xmath19 , by not including buffer and substrate layers and contacts into calculations ( compare with structure described in table [ table_1 ] ) .",
    "an estimate , based on geometric dimensions of substrate layers and their microscopic parameters ( doping concentration , carrier mobility ) gives us a value of @xmath19 of the order of @xmath20 . at lasing threshold current of @xmath21",
    ", that small resistance will cause a difference between computed by us lasing offset voltage @xmath9 and that measured one by about @xmath22 only . we still will however have a noticeable contribution from @xmath19 to differential resistance @xmath23 .",
    "the most accurate way of finding @xmath14 is by extrapolating the linear part of @xmath24 to @xmath25 just after the current larger than @xmath14 .",
    "we used a set of gnuplot and perl scripts for that that could be run semi - automatically , very effectively , on a large collection of datasets .",
    "one should only take care that the data range for fiting is properly chosen , since @xmath24 is a linear function in a certain range of @xmath26 values only .",
    "the choice of that range may affect accuracy of data analysis .      an exponential @xmath27 dependence is found to work well at voltages which are well below the lasing offset voltage @xmath9 . near the lasing threshold , we observe a strong departure from that dependence , and , in particular , for many data curves a clear kink in @xmath27 is observed at @xmath9 .",
    "we find that a modified exponential dependence describes the data very well :    @xmath28    where @xmath14 , @xmath9 , as well @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are certain fiting parameters .",
    "equation [ exponential_6_parameters ] offers a convenient interpretation of physical meaning of it s parameters @xmath14 and @xmath9 : @xmath33 .",
    "the above function ( eq . [ exponential_6_parameters ] ) is continuous at @xmath9 , as it obviously should , but it s derivative is usually not .",
    "figure [ doping21a ] shows a few typical examples of @xmath34 datasets .",
    "the lines were computed analytically by using eq . [ exponential_6_parameters ] , after finding all parameters with the least - squares method .    since ( [ exponential_6_parameters ] )",
    "may have a discontinuous derivative , using it to find out differential resistance at @xmath9 is ambiguous . from eq .",
    "( [ exponential_6_parameters ] ) , at @xmath35 , we will have @xmath36 on the side @xmath37 and @xmath38 on the side @xmath39 .",
    "hence , the parameter @xmath31 may be interpreted in terms of differential resistivity just above @xmath9 :    @xmath40    we find from data analysis , for instance for the third dataset in figure [ doping21a ] , that @xmath41 , which , together with estimated contact resistance @xmath42 gives good qualitative agreement with the differential resistance expected for real lasers , where it is in the range of about @xmath43 ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ doping28 ] shows the dependence of parameter @xmath32 in eq .",
    "[ exponential_6_parameters ] on n- , and p - emitters doping concentration , for a very broad range of doping concentrations in other regions ( this is `` n - n '' type of doping ; see description of table [ table_1 ] ) . due to large scatter of the parameters obtained by the least - squares fiting",
    ", we do not distinguish between datapoints that were obtained for various doping concentrations in waveguides or in active region : the dominant factor on values of @xmath31 or @xmath32 parameters is doping concentration in emitter regions .",
    "we observe also that a correlation exists between values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 parameters , as illustrated in figure [ doping30 ] .",
    "the line in figure [ doping30 ] was obtained by using the least - squares fiting method to all the data points displayed there , with the following simple function :    @xmath44    it is convenient to rewrite equation [ exponential_6_parameters ] in dimensionless variables . in case of @xmath45 we have then :    @xmath46 \\right ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where we defined : @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and we used also eq .",
    "[ exponential_6_parameters_5 ] .",
    "let us estimate the range of reasonable values of @xmath51 parameter",
    ".    the function [ parameters_11 ] would give the ratio @xmath52 for @xmath31 decreasing to @xmath53 ( which corresponds to decreasing doping concentration in emitter regions to @xmath53 ) .",
    "that function will pass through @xmath53 at values of @xmath54 , which corresponds to doping in emitters of around @xmath55 , will have minimum of value @xmath56 at concentrations corresponding to @xmath57 , and will increase to @xmath58 at larger doping concentrations .",
    "the practical range of interest in our case is not at the lowest doping concentrations in emitters , since than other laser parameters deteriorate .",
    "we are left with @xmath59 values that are important to us in the range between @xmath60 and @xmath53 .",
    "hence , the corresponding range of @xmath51 values that is of our interest is between @xmath61 and @xmath53 .",
    "it is tempting to try a simplified version of [ dimensionless ] , when the expression under exponent is @xmath62 .",
    "we have in that case the following approximation on optical efficiency :    @xmath63                  } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    figure [ eta_02 ] shows a few example curves computed with equation [ exponential_6_parameters_9 ] . the accuracy of these results , if compared with real data ( not shown on that figure ) , appears to be far from desired ; eq .",
    "[ exponential_6_parameters_9 ] may be treated as a very rough approximation only .",
    "let us use however the full version of equation [ exponential_6_parameters ] ( for @xmath39 ) , for computing optical efficiency .",
    "we have then :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is given by eq .",
    "[ dimensionless ] .",
    "figure [ eta_03 ] shows that an excellent agreement is obtained when these analytical formulas are used for approximating optical efficiency directly computed from modeling data .",
    "the parameters used in fiting the data are shown in figure [ eta_03a ] . as seen on this figure ,",
    "the value of @xmath51 for some datapoints is lower than @xmath58 .",
    "this should not be considered contradictory to our estimate of the range of possible values of @xmath51 : our calculations of @xmath1 do not take into account the nonlinearity of @xmath24 dependence , which may be large , especially for low doping concentrations in emitters , and that will effectively cause decrease of @xmath51 value .",
    "we see also that the parameter @xmath66 is too small ( i.e. @xmath67 is too large ) in realistic cases to allow using the simplified equation [ exponential_6_parameters_9 ] .",
