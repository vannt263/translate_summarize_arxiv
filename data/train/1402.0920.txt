    "diffusion of inclusions in membranes occurs in 2-dimensional ( 2d ) media embedded in solvents , and is different from that in a homogeneous 3-dimensional ( 3d ) fluid . in the pioneering work by saffmann and delbrck  @xcite , the membrane was regarded as a thin plane sheet bounded on both sides by solvents .",
    "solvents are dragged by the flow in the membrane through the coupling to the solvent flow at the solvent / membrane interfaces .",
    "the transfer of momentum between the membrane and solvents necessitates the introduction of a length called the saffmann - delbrck ( sd ) hydrodynamic screening length  @xcite .",
    "the sd expression of the diffusion coefficient has been elaborated to apply to the larger size of objects  @xcite .",
    "although some experiments were not explained by the sd theory @xcite , the sd theory and its extended expressions have been supported by certain experiments  @xcite . when the membrane is supported on a solid substrate , a very thin layer of solvent exists between the membrane and the solid support  @xcite . for supported membranes ,",
    "the assumption of infinite thickness of solvents in sd theory is irrelevant ; the diffusion coefficient decreases when the thickness of solvent layer is decreased  @xcite .",
    "the length scale of momentum transfer is characterized by a new length scale , called evans - sackmann ( es ) hydrodynamic screening length in the limit of thin layer of solvent .",
    "when the size of the diffusing object exceeds the es hydrodynamic screening length , the diffusion coefficient is predicted to show the inverse square size - dependence  @xcite .",
    "the inverse square size - dependence has been observed in supported lipid bilayers  @xcite .    in the earlier works ,",

    "the smaller regions form circular viscous domains and diffuse laterally .",
    "the diffusion coefficients of liquid domains have been obtained using hydrodynamic calculations by ignoring a shear flow across the membrane  @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible to form membranes with bilayer consisting of two leaflets having different compositions  @xcite .",
    "the liquid domains in each leaflet do not necessarily lie on top of one another ; the liquid domains can be formed in one of the leaflets without overlapping to those in the other leaflet . in general , the velocity fields associated with each leaflet are different and the layers sliding past each other cause frictional coupling  @xcite .",
    "when relative motion of the leaflets does not play a significant role , the bilayer can be considered as a single fluid medium .",
    "however , the inter - leaflet friction would induce different transport in two leaflets of the bilayer for supported membranes , because each leaflet faces different environment  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when the solvent thickness is small , typical for supported membranes , the relative velocity difference between the wall and the membrane induces a shear flow in the solvent through the stick boundary condition .",

    "@xcite , we present the analytical expressions showing the effect of the inter - leaflet friction on the diffusion coefficients for the general thickness of solvent . by examining the asymmetry in diffusion coefficients associated with the upper and lower leaflet for supported membranes , we find that the value of inter - leaflet friction can be estimated .",
    "in addition , we show that the momentum is dissipated by the inter - leaflet friction , but this dissipation mechanism is not sufficient to overcome logarithmic long - range correlations in the flow fields leading to a divergence of the diffusion coefficient . in order to corroborate our theory ,",
    "the correlated diffusion is studied under the influence of the inter - leaflet friction .    in experiments ,",
    "the frictional interaction between the leaflets has been studied in detail by applying the interlayer shear stress induced by a large local deformation  @xcite .",
    "zhang and granick concluded that the difference in diffusion coefficient of lipids between two leaflets is small for supported bilayers  @xcite .",
    "detailed investigation on diffusion of lipids in leaflets on supported membranes suggests that the diffusion coefficient of lipids in the lower leaflet is reduced from that of the upper leaflet depending on the type of substrate  @xcite .",
    "simulations have been also performed to estimate the value of inter - leaflet friction  @xcite . from coarse - grained molecular simulations , the lateral diffusion of lipids in the lower leaflet to the solid substrate",
    "was shown to be slower than that of the upper leaflet by one order of magnitude  @xcite .",
