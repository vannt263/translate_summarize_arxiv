    "thompson s groups @xmath6 and @xmath8 have been studied at length , and possess many unusual and interesting properties . for example , @xmath6 is a torsion - free group of type  @xmath2 with infinite cohomological dimension , and @xmath8 is an infinite simple group of type  @xmath2 .",
    "an introduction to @xmath6 and @xmath8 can be found in  @xcite , in which the _ paired tree diagrams _ approach to the groups is discussed .",
    "this is the approach that we will take here as well .",
    "we will follow the definitions given in  @xcite , where in addition the braided thompson s groups @xmath0 and @xmath1 are defined in terms of _ braided paired tree diagrams_. we will also , less formally , picture elements of these groups in the language of _ strand diagrams _ , as in  @xcite .",
    "we first recall the definition of @xmath8 . by a _",
    "rooted binary tree _ we mean a finite tree such that every vertex has degree @xmath31 , except the _ leaves _ , which have degree @xmath32 , and the _ root _ , which has degree @xmath33 ( or degree @xmath32 if the root is also a leaf ) .",
    "usually we draw such trees with the root at the top and the nodes descending from it , down to the leaves . a non - leaf node together with the two nodes directly below it",
    "is called a _",
    "caret_. if the leaves of a caret in @xmath7 are leaves of @xmath7 , we will call the caret _",
    "elementary_. note that a rooted binary tree always consists of @xmath34 carets and has @xmath4 leaves , for some @xmath10 .    by a _",
    "paired tree diagram _ we mean a triple @xmath35 consisting of two rooted binary trees  @xmath36 and  @xmath37 with the same number of leaves @xmath4 , and a permutation  @xmath38 .",
    "the leaves of  @xmath36 are labeled @xmath39 from left to right , and for each @xmath40 , the @xmath41 leaf of  @xmath37 is labeled @xmath40 .",
    "there is an equivalence relation on paired tree diagrams given by reductions and expansions . by a _ reduction _ we mean the following : suppose there is an elementary caret in  @xmath36 with left leaf labeled @xmath40 and right leaf labeled  @xmath42 , and an elementary caret in  @xmath37 with left leaf labeled  @xmath40 and right leaf labeled  @xmath42",
    ". then we can `` reduce '' the diagram by removing those carets , renumbering the leaves and replacing @xmath43 with the permutation  @xmath44 that sends the new leaf of  @xmath36 to the new leaf of  @xmath37 , and otherwise behaves like  @xmath43 .",
    "the resulting paired tree diagram  @xmath45 is then said to be obtained by _ reducing _",
    "the reverse operation to reduction is called _ expansion _ , so @xmath35 is an expansion of @xmath45 .",
    "a paired tree diagram is called _ reduced _ if there is no reduction possible .",
    "thus an equivalence class of paired tree diagrams consists of all diagrams having a common reduced representative .",
    "such reduced representatives are unique",
