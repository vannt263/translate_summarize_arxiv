    "observations of nearby early - type galaxies have shown that a large fraction ( 20 - 70% ) of lmxbs are associated with gcs ( e.g. , sarazin , irwin , & bregman 2001 ; angelini , loewenstein , & mushotzky 2001 ; kundu , maccarone , & zepf 2002 ; minniti et al .",

    "moreover , a study of lmxbs near the center of ngc 4472 showed that the metal - rich red gcs ( rgcs ) are more likely by a factor of @xmath1 to harbor lmxbs than blue gcs ( bgcs ) ( kundu , maccarone , & zepf 2002 ) .",
    "this preferred association of lmxbs with metal - rich gcs ( but with some variations among galaxies ) was later confirmed by sarazin et al .",

    "several binary formation / evolution scenarios have been discussed to explain these results ( e.g. , grindlay 1993 ; bellazzini et al .",
    "1995 ; maccarone , kundu , & zepf 2004 ; ivanova 2005 ) ; however , it is still unclear why metallicity plays such an important role in lmxb formation and what causes the observed galaxy to galaxy variations in the fraction of lmxbs associated with rgcs and bgcs .",
    "the lmxb @xmath0 gc association is particularly intriguing , because the high stellar density near the center of gcs may trigger the formation of binaries effectively by either three - body process or tidal capture .",
    "these binaries would then evolve into lmxbs , as first suggested by @xcite for the milky way .",
    "given the larger density of gcs in elliptical galaxies @xcite , this mechanism has been recently reproposed @xcite .",
    "the observational evidence is , however , ambiguous .",
    "the majority of lmxbs are not directly connected to gcs .",
    "the field@xmath0lmxbs might have evolved from field binary stars or might have been formed in gcs and then dispersed in the field ; either sn kick or dynamical interaction within gcs have been considered as ways to extract lmxbs from their parent gc @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite analyzed the relation between the fraction of gc@xmath0lmxbs ( or their co - added x - ray luminosity of lmxbs ) and the gc specific frequency ( @xmath3 ) and concluded that exclusive gc formation for lmxbs may not be supported by the data .",
    "however , all these observational studies are based on relatively small gc@xmath0lmxb samples , resulting from the small field of view of the observations used to identify gcs .    here , we utilize both and ground - based observations in our study of 6 elliptical galaxies observed with .",
    "@xcite showed that the 2 data supplemented by wide - field ground based data are very effective to investigate gc systems of elliptical galaxies , since the crowding problem in ground - based observations is not severe for the outer region of the galaxy .",
    "combination of the and ground - based observations enables us not only to expand the available sample , but also to extend the study of lmxbs to the outer part of the galaxy , which has not been studied so far .",
    "it is also important to compare lmxbs and gcs in the same galaxy scale and extract their properties ( e.g. , @xmath4(lmxb ) , @xmath5(gc - lmxb ) and @xmath3 ) from the same region .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in  2 we describe the sample galaxies and the data analysis method for the extraction of both lmxb and gc samples .",

    "since the typical seeing size of ground based observations is @xmath55 , we only consider extended sources with a size smaller than @xmath56 , which might be misclassified as a point source in ground based observations . counting the number of hdf sources located in the same cmd region with our optical gcs",

    "the pixel coordinate is then transformed to the world coordinate by cross - correlating the usnob1 catalog @xcite .",
    "a typical error of this transformation is @xmath62 arcsec .",
    "however , we can not use the usnob1 catalog for the 2 data because there are only a small number of usnob1 sources inside the 2 field of view , particularly when it is aiming at the center of a galaxy which is often saturated and also highly non - uniform .",
    "instead , we use the transformed ground - based data as a template to obtain the world coordinate for 2 sources . the transformation error between the ground - based data and 2 data",
    "is dominated by the former error ( @xmath63 ) due to the negligible positional error of the 2 data .      using the x - ray positional errors at the 95% confidence level @xcite , we first select optical sources inside the error radius . to minimize false matches , we further limit the search radius to @xmath64 and visually inspect the optical image for validation .",
    "most ( @xmath65 ) x - ray sources have error radii smaller than @xmath66 .",

    "the median positional offset is @xmath70 .    to identify field lmxbs ( i.e. , x - ray sources without an optical counterpart ) , we first select the x - ray sources without optical counterpart inside @xmath71 .",
    "we then visually inspect the optical images at the position of x - ray sources to look for optical counterparts just outside the error circle and undetected sources due to chip defects and/or saturation effect of nearby bright sources .",
    "in our sample of 665 x - ray point sources inside the 25 ellipse ( but excluding the central 20 arcsec region ) , we identify 285 ( @xmath72 ) gc@xmath0lmxb and 258 ( @xmath73 ) field@xmath0lmxb .",
    "we list the match statistics for each galaxy in table [ tab - psrc2 ] .",
    "since our match criteria are rather conservative , we are left with 122 x - ray sources for which we can not establish whether they match with gcs or not .",
    "some of them match with non - gc optical sources .",
    "we do not use these x - ray sources in the following analysis to minimize the uncertainty of x - ray source characteristics .    to assess the probability of false matches , we applied two independent methods .",
    "first , to determine the probability of finding an optical source by chance , we shifted the x - ray source position by @xmath74 , corresponding to @xmath75 times the typical 95% position error , and then we tried to match them with optical sources as explained above . based on 100 simulations for the whole 3 field of view , we find @xmath76 matches , which is considerably smaller than the 43% match occurrence obtained for the observed x - ray source positions . secondly , we redistributed the optical sources randomly , but following the observed gc radial profile , and kept the number of sources the same as that of the observed sources .",
    "the number of random matches with optical gcs is @xmath77 ( or @xmath78 ) , and decreases ( by @xmath79 ) when x - ray sources in @xmath80 arcsec are excluded .",
    "adopting the radial profile of the halo light instead of the gc profile affects very little the number of random matches ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the chance probability of a false match is small compared to the number of gc@xmath0lmxb associations .",
    "we summarize the match statistics for the point sources in this radial range in table [ tab - psrc3 ] .",
    "the mean probability for a gc to harbor an lmxb , defined by @xmath82 = n(gc@xmath0lmxb ) / n(gc ) , is @xmath83 5.2% in our sample of 6 galaxies .",
    "this is slightly larger than that of @xcite for the central region of ngc 4472 , mainly due to the high fraction ( 9.8% ) in ngc 1399 . the mean probability excluding ngc 1399 is @xmath84 .",
    "while the fraction of bgcs with an lmxb ( @xmath85 ) is relatively constant ( @xmath83 2% ) with the exception of ngc 1399 ( 5.8% ) , that of rgcs ( @xmath86 ) widely varies from one galaxy to another ( 2.7%  13% ) , resulting in @xmath87 varying from 1.4 to 4.6 .",

    "since the fit with a single power law is already good and a more complex model is not required , the parameters of the broken power law are not well constrained , but our results ( @xmath118 erg s@xmath113 ; slope = @xmath119 and @xmath120 below and above the break ) are consistent with @xcite .    the @xmath2 luminosity ratios for lmxbs found in gcs are displayed in fig .",

    "the bgc@xmath0lmxb sample of the central region peaks at the higher @xmath2 , but this effect is not conclusive because of the large errors .",
    "note that a typical lmxb x - ray luminosity is roughly @xmath121 of the optical luminosity in @xmath17 band of an entire gc , and a few lmxbs are more luminous than their host gcs ( @xmath122 ) .    to investigate the x - ray spectral properties of different sub - samples , we use the x - ray hardness ratio , defined as hr = ( h@xmath0s ) / ( h@xmath123s ) , where s and h are net counts in @xmath124 kev and @xmath125 kev , respectively .",

    "we apply a bayesian approach developed by @xcite , which models the detected counts as a non - homogeneous poisson process . taking into account the acis qe degradation which could change the soft band counts by @xmath129 @xcite",

    "are summarized in table [ tab - rprof2 ] .",

    "this trend is more pronounced in bgcs than in rgcs .",
    "this result is consistent with previous optical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , surprisingly , we find that the radial profile of gcs with lmxbs is significantly steeper than that of the optical gc population , but close to that of the halo light ( see the top part of fig .",
    "[ fig - rprofall ] ) .",
    "the difference of the radial profile slope between the whole gcs and gcs with lmxbs is 1.45 , which corresponds to a statistical significance of @xmath131 ( see table [ tab - rprof2 ] ) .",
    "this result is consistent with our result (  4.2 ) of gcs having a higher chance to harbor lmxbs in the central region and suggests an important clue for the lmxb formation mechanism ( see  5 ) .",
    "this trend is also valid for rgcs and bgcs separately .",
    "while the radial profile of rgcs ( either the entire gc sample or gcs with lmxbs ) is steeper than that of bgcs , the radial profile of gcs with lmxbs is still steeper than the optical gcs in both bgcs and rgcs samples .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the radial profile slope of the field@xmath0lmxbs is very similar to that of rgc@xmath0lmxbs , while steeper than , but still consistent with that of bgc@xmath0lmxbs .    to make sure that these differences in radial distributions are not a statistical fluke",
    ", we performed 1000 simulations by randomly selecting the same number of gcs as observed from the whole gc sample , then fitting the radial profile by the same method which used in fig .",
    "[ fig - rprofall ] .",
    "we find that the probability that the random sample has a steeper slope than the observed is @xmath132 ( @xmath133 and @xmath134 for bgc and rgc separately ) .",
    "to further check for possible contamination by foreground stars and background galaxies , we compared the radial profiles produced by the data and the ground optical observations separately ( fig .",
    "[ fig - rprofopt ] ) .",
    "as demonstrated in  2 , the contamination in our sample of optical gcs is small based on comparison between the and ground - based data , the gc radial profiles produced by ground - based and data are consistent with each other within a @xmath115 error for all sub populations of gcs .",
    "using and hubble archival data of 6 elliptical galaxies , supplemented by deep optical ground - based imaging observations , we identify 6173 gcs and 665 lmxbs within the @xmath10 ellipse of these galaxies (  2 ) . applying conservative matching criteria , we find 285 lmxbs coincident with gcs ( 209 in rgc and 76 in bgc ) and 259 lmxbs in the field (  3 ) .",
    "this is the largest gc @xmath123 lmxb sample studied so far .",
    "we find that the probability to find lmxbs is on average @xmath83 3 times higher for rgcs than bgcs , but with a non - negligible variation from one galaxy to another (  3.2 ) , consistent with previous reports of early type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , , and in the milky way and m31 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this result indicates that metal abundance plays a key role in forming lmxbs in the globular clusters , as suggested by the above authors .",
    "the physical mechanism linking the metallicity and the formation and evolution of lmxbs is not well understood .",
    "@xcite suggested that the larger stellar size of a metal rich star can increase the tidal capture rate , making it easier to fill the roche - lobe , and therefore may be responsible for the preferential association of lmxbs with metal rich rgcs .",
    "instead , @xcite showed that the effect of the larger stellar size is not enough to explain the observed difference , and proposed an irradiation induced stellar wind model , where a metal - poor star ( in bgc ) with a stronger stellar wind evolves more rapidly than a metal - rich star in rgc .",
    "this model predicts harder x - ray spectra in bgc@xmath0lmxbs than rgc@xmath0lmxbs , because of the extra absorption by accreting materials in bgc@xmath0lmxbs ( their estimated column density @xmath135 @xmath136 ) .",
    "however , when we compare the x - ray spectral hardness / absorption of rgc and bgc sources (  4.3 ) , we find no statistically significant differences .",
    "although we can not rule out a small amount of intrinsic absorption given the statistical uncertainty , we estimate that @xmath137 can not exceed @xmath138 @xmath136 in both rgcs and bgcs .",
    "therefore , our result does not support the prediction of the stellar wind model .",
    "recently , ivanova ( 2005 ) suggests that the absence of an outer convective zone in the metal poor main sequence star may explain the observed trend . because magnetic breaking , necessary for the orbital decay to form a compact x - ray binary , does not turn on without the outer convective zone ,",
    "the efficiency to form lmxbs is considerably lower in bgcs than in rgcs .",
    "if this scenario is correct , there is no specific reason for different x - ray obscuration and the x - ray spectral properties of lmxbs in rgcs and bgcs would be similar , as indicated in our results .",
    "however , no theoretical model , so far , can explain why the fraction of lmxbs in rgcs and bgcs considerably varies from one galaxy to another ( from 1.4 to 4.6 ; ",
    "3.2 ) .",
    "we have found that the gcs located near the center of galaxies have a higher probability to harbor lmxbs compared to those in the outskirts .",
    "this trend is confirmed with a high significance both by the luminosity dependent gc@xmath0lmxb fractions in different regions (  4.2 ) and by the radial profiles of lmxbs and gcs (  4.4 ) .",
    "although a negative radial gradient of the average gc metallicity is known in some elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it can be mostly attributed to the steeper radial profile of metal - rich rgcs , compared to that of metal - poor bgcs ( * ? ? ? * as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - rprofall ] ) therefore , the metallicity gradient for the rgc and bgc individually is not significant @xcite and can not explain the observed higher probability to harbor an lmxb near the galactic center than in the outskirts",
    ". a secondary mechanism , dependent on the galacto - centric distance , must play an important role in the gc@xmath0lmxb formation , with the metallicity being the primary mechanism as discussed above .",
    "one possible explanation is that gcs near the galactic center may have a compact core and a higher central density than gcs in the outer regions , as a result of selective gc disruption by the galactic tidal force .",
    "this conclusion is also consistent with the recent study of m31 where the central density of gcs increases toward the center of m31 ( barmby , holland , & huchra 2002 ; see also bellazzini et al .",
    "therefore , the chance to form lmxbs is expected to increase in gcs near the galaxy center because of a higher rate of either tidal capture or exchange interaction resulting from the higher central stellar density .",
    "based on the structural parameters of individual gcs determined with the data of m87 , jordan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) showed that the encounter rate ( @xmath139 ) of gcs with lmxbs is considerably higher than the mean @xmath139 .",
    "they formulated a probability of a gc hosting an lmxb as a function of @xmath139 and z. this formulation is consistent with similar results on galactic gcs by @xcite and @xcite , and with the higher central density of m31 gcs with lmxbs ( bellazzini et al .",
    "our results further support that the probability of harboring an lmxb requires a secondary parameter in addition to metallicity .",
    "based on the correlation between @xmath139 and luminosity , jordan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) also suggested that the luminosity dependency on the fraction of gcs with lmxbs may be a consequence of a more fundamental relation between @xmath139 and luminosity .",
    "as reported previously ( e.g. , sarazin et al . 2003 ) , we confirm that the more luminous gcs have a higher probability to host lmxbs (  4.1 ) .",
    "this trend is valid for each rgc and bgc subsample .",
    "however , we find that the linearity holds only in rgcs , but not in bgcs .",
    "the rgc@xmath0lmxb fraction increases by a factor of @xmath83 5.5 as @xmath91 increases from 8 mag to 9.8 mag ( i.e. , brighter by a factor of 5.2 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the expected linear increase of the lmxb fraction with increasing luminosity . on the other hand ,",
    "the bgc@xmath0lmxb fraction increases only by a factor of @xmath83 2 with the same optical magnitude range .",
    "this may indicate a complex relation in metal poor gcs between the cluster luminosity ( or mass ) and the lmxb fraction , as might be suggested by ivanova ( 2005 ) .",
    "it is well known that no bh x - ray binary has been found in galactic gcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , the total number of gc@xmath0lmxbs in the milky way is relatively small .",
    "@xcite showed that the duty cycle for a bh binary formed in the center of a dense cluster by an exchange interaction is extremely low .",
    "for early type galaxies , mixed results have been reported .",
    "@xcite reported a weak tendency for bright lmxbs to avoid gcs and @xcite reported that no bright gc@xmath0lmxb ( ie .",
    ", bh candidates ) is identified in ngc 5128 . on the other hand ,",
    "a number of luminous gc@xmath0 lmxbs are found in n1399 @xcite and m87 @xcite .",
    "@xcite have even claimed that gc@xmath0lmxbs are on the average more luminous than the field lmxbs .",
    "we found with high statistical confidence (  4.3 ) that the xlfs of gc@xmath0lmxbs and field@xmath0lmxbs are statistically consistent , indicating that luminous lmxbs are equally found in gcs and in the field . more specifically , there are 26 gc@xmath0lmxbs and 27 field lmxbs with @xmath140 erg sec@xmath113 .",
    "we note that @xmath141 erg sec@xmath113 corresponds to the break luminosity of the lmxb xlf where ns and bh x - ray binaries are likely separated , as identified by @xcite . more conservatively , if we consider @xmath112 erg sec@xmath113 , there are still 8 gc@xmath0lmxbs and 3 field@xmath0lmxbs",
    ". therefore , our results do not support the hypothesis that a gc can not harbor a bh x - ray binary .",
    "we find on average an equal number of lmxbs in gcs and in the field , although with a non - negligible galaxy to galaxy variation .",
    "one of the key questions to understand lmxb formation is whether gcs are the only birth place for all lmxbs . in this scenario ,",
    "field@xmath0lmxbs were originally formed in gcs and they were then ejected from the parent gc or left alone in the field as the gc was disrupted .",
    "utilizing the fact that the radial profile of gcs is flatter than that of the galactic halo light ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we tested this hypothesis by determining whether the radial profile of field@xmath0lmxbs follows that of gcs or that of the halo light .",
    "we found (  4.4 ) that regardless of their association with gcs , lmxbs are distributed like the optical halo light , not the gcs .",
    "the close agreement between the radial distributions of the optical light and lmxbs has also been reported in ngc 1316 @xcite , ngc 1332 @xcite and ngc 4486 @xcite .",
    "this seems to suggest a rather complex connection , depending on various factors operating in the lmxb formation in gcs and its subsequent evolution ( see  5.2 ) .",
    "because of the similar radial distribution between gc@xmath0lmxbs and field@xmath0lmxbs , we can neither prove nor reject the hypothesis whether field@xmath0lmxbs were originally formed in the gc .",
    "if field@xmath0lmxbs were ejected from gcs , they may still be in the neighbourhood of the parent cluster .",
    "we therefore searched for a nearby gc , which could have been the previous host of the current field@xmath0lmxb , and compared the results with the expectation from the mean space density of gcs .",
    "firstly , we find that the mean angular distance of the nearest gc from the field lmxbs is @xmath142 arcsec .",
    "this is compatible with the expected mean random separation , based on the space density of gcs ( @xmath83 8 arcsec ) , indicating that there is no preference to find a potential host gc near a field - lmxb .",
    "secondly , we measure the gc surface density near the field - lmxbs . again , the estimated density is comparable with that expected from the gc space density ( @xmath143 gcs / arcmin@xmath144 ) .",
    "based on simple relations of @xmath5(gc@xmath0lmxb ) and @xmath4(lmxb ) against the gc specific frequency ( @xmath3 ) , @xcite and @xcite suggested that a considerable fraction of field@xmath0lmxbs were indeed formed in the field .",
    "although this suggestion is intriguing , reality may be more complex .",
    "their relations may test the hypothesis of field@xmath0lmxbs ejected from the parent gcs , but can not work if the parent gcs were disrupted , because the current @xmath3 would not include gcs disrupted in the past .",
    "furthermore , because @xmath3 is usually determined in a large scale ( e.g. , compared to the field of view ) , it is important to determine lmxb properties at a comparable scale to compare with @xmath3 .",
    "however , the previous studies are mostly limited to the field of view .",
    "if we plot our data of table 10 in the same figure of @xcite , the relation appears to be less convincing ( fig .",
    "[ fig - sn ] ) .",
    "most galaxies ( 4 out of 6 ) have almost constant @xmath5(gc@xmath0lmxb ) ( 50 @xmath145 5% ) , but with a wide range of @xmath146 ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the remaining two galaxies are also outliers .",
    "ngc 4374 has the smallest gc@xmath0lmxb fraction ( 30% ) in our sample , but with a rather modest @xmath3 ( 3.2 , taken from gmez & richtler 2004 ; harris 1991 or 6.6 from kissler - patig 1997 ) .",
    "ngc 1399 has the highest gc@xmath0lmxb fraction ( 65% ) in our sample , but @xmath3 is only 4.6 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the proposed relationship with @xmath3 does not appear to be straightforward .",
    "the situation could be even more complex , for example , because of different merger histories ( e.g. , schweitzer 2003 ) and different degrees of environment - dependent gc stripping ( bekki et al .",
    "2003 ) which would add significant galaxy to galaxy variations . in particular , we note that three galaxies with the lowest gc@xmath0lmxb fraction ( ngc 1553 , ngc 3115 , ngc 1332 ) are all s0 galaxies .",

    "the same trend is also confirmed by the steeper radial profile of gc@xmath0lmxbs ( for both rgc and bgc ) , when compared to that of the whole gc sample .",
    "this suggests there must be another parameter ( in addition to metallicity ) for lmxb formation in gcs , which critically depends on the galacto - centric distance .",
