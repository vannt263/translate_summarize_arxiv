    "our local cosmological neighborhood is made of baryons , while fraction of antimatter , presumably of astrophysical origin , is vanishingly small .",
    "so the observations indicate that the universe is 100% baryo - asymmetric , at least locally .",
    "the baryon asymmetry ( of the universe ) , bau , can not be explained in the frameworks of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics . alongside with evidence for dark matter and dark energy",
    "it is considered as unambiguous proof of the existence of new physics beyond sm .",
    "many quite different extensions of the sm and various scenarios for the bau generation were suggested in the literature , for a review see e.g. refs .",
    "typically , consideration is restricted to the models where the universe is asymmetric globally .",
    "this is the simplest possibility .",
    "however , it is not excluded that the real universe may be globally symmetric .",
    "it may consist of domains of matter and antimatter , and if the domains are sufficiently large and far away , they may escape observational constraints on matter - antimatter annihilation at the domain boundaries",
    ". in the simplest version of the scenario the distance to the nearest domain of antimatter should be close to the present day cosmological horizon  @xcite .",
    "corresponding particle physics models , leading to the universe creation with abundant antimatter domains were suggested and developed in the past . while being more involved , the models of this type also suffer from the inherent problem  a domain wall problem  @xcite .",
    "indeed , bau can be generated only if @xmath1 violation is sufficiently strong , beyond the sm capabilities .",
    "in addition , in globally symmetric universe @xmath1 should have different signs in different domains .",
    "this non - trivial pattern of @xmath1 violation could be provided by a dedicated physical field , one way or another .",
    "therefore , unavoidably , domains with different @xmath1 phase would be separated by domain walls with unacceptably high energy density , in conflict with observations .",
    "there is only one way out of this restriction .",
    "namely , domains with different sign ( and possibly strength ) of @xmath1 violation should exist only in the universe past and should disappear by now , all together with domain walls , though their effects in the form of matter and antimatter objects would survive to the present day .",
    "one class of models where this can be achieved has been suggested in refs .",
    "the main idea behind is a possibility of an unusual symmetry behavior at high temperatures .",
    "it is well known that a symmetry , which is broken in vacuum , at high temperatures tends to be restored .",
    "but in general , the situation is not that simple and straightforward .",
    "it is also possible that a symmetry is broken only in a particular range of temperatures , i.e. it is restored at the highest as well as at the lowest temperatures , for the particular models and details see  @xcite .",
    "this is just what is needed for a matter - antimatter domain generation without domain wall problem .",
    "however , if a model is based on the unusual symmetry behavior at high temperatures , then the size of domains will be too small from the cosmological point of view .",
    "such models are still interesting , because they could provide a local excess of antimatter , which would be large compared to the capabilities of astrophysical sources , if an excess  @xcite turns out to be real . but cosmologically large and separated domains of antimatter can not be created by this mechanism .",
    "cosmology with domains of matter and antimatter was discussed in the lectures  @xcite , where a list of relevant references can be found . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , domain walls could be also eliminated if the vacua in the model were not exactly degenerate . in this case",
    "the higher energy vacuum would be `` swallowed '' by the lower energy one if the energy difference is sufficiently high .    in the present paper",
    "we suggest another scenario of unusual symmetry behavior .",
    "now this happens during inflationary stage in the universe evolution .",
    "domains with different sign of @xmath1 disappear by now also , so the domain wall problem is absent .",
    "however , they appeared during inflation and survived at the baryogenesis epoch , therefore , cosmologically large domains of matter and antimatter could be created .",
    "in the suggested model the difference between matter and antimatter is generated by pseudoscalar field @xmath2 which interacts with inflaton field @xmath3 .",
    "we assume the following lagrangian : @xmath4 where @xmath5 here the metric tensor enters into kinetic terms in the usual way , and @xmath6 are some constant parameters , with @xmath7 having dimension of mass , @xmath8 being dimensionless .",
    "we do not include the quartic term @xmath9 in the lagrangian , though it possibly may lead to some interesting consequences .",
    "this case will be studied elsewhere .",
    "the dimensionless function @xmath10 is chosen in the way that it is non - zero only when @xmath3 is close to some constant value @xmath11 . in this paper",
    "we choose it as gaussian function @xmath12 , \\label{v - of - phi}\\ ] ] though other forms may be possible .",
    "the plot of function @xmath10 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : v ] ) is a bell - shaped curve .",
    "parameters @xmath11 and @xmath13 have dimension of mass and indicate position of the `` bell '' center and characteristic width of the `` bell '' , respectively .     function @xmath10 .",
    "the parameters are @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "field @xmath3 is measured in units of @xmath16 and @xmath10 is dimensionless . ]",
    "the equations of motion have the form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the hubble parameter , @xmath19 is the cosmological scale factor which enters into the flrw metric as @xmath20 it is assumed here that fields @xmath3 and @xmath2 depend only on time , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the hubble parameter is expressed through the energy density @xmath23 as @xmath24 where @xmath25 gev is the planck mass .",
    "the interaction introduced above leads to the following scenario . during inflation the magnitude of the inflaton field @xmath3 decreases and when it reaches vicinity of @xmath26 is larger than @xmath26 . ]",
    "two minima appear in the potential @xmath27 at constant @xmath3 , so the point @xmath28 becomes local maximum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : u - phi - chi ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] one can see how the field @xmath2 rolls down to the minimum of the potential @xmath29 and oscillates there .",
    "then it goes back to the old minimum at @xmath30 , but even at the end of inflation @xmath2 remains an order of magnitude larger than it was at the beginning ( @xmath31 at @xmath32 , while @xmath33 ) . at the moment @xmath34 the field @xmath2 crosses zero and starts slow oscillations with very low frequency , which could be much lower than the characteristic rate of baryogenesis .",
    "so we see that parameters ( [ eq : parameters ] ) are chosen in a proper way . in this model",
    "the influence of @xmath2 on the process of inflation is insignificant , thus the domain size grows exponentially .",
    "however , as we have mentioned at the end of the previous section , it is also important to know how the regions where @xmath28 expand during inflation .",
    "the hypothetical situation is possible when the areas where field is zero expand exponentially faster than the areas where field is non - zero .",
    "for example , the model where inflation never stops near the domain walls , i.e. near @xmath35 , was suggested in @xcite .",
    "also the idea of never ending topological inflation where @xmath36 is forced to stay near the maximum of its potential @xmath35 was proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , our situation is quite different .",
    "numerical calculation shows that if @xmath28 the hubble parameter remains almost the same as in the case of non - zero @xmath2 , and the size of region where @xmath28 is approximately two times less than the domain size .",
    "therefore , our model predicts the domains of cosmological size with the distances between them of the same order of magnitude .",
    "as it is commonly known , the stage of inflation is followed by the stage of ( re)heating , during which the very heavy @xmath37 particles can be produced through decay of inflaton field ( see e.g. book  @xcite ) or from vacuum fluctuations in gravitational field  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the situation when the inflaton field @xmath3 interacts with @xmath37 particles ( for example , scalar bosons ) through the coupling @xmath38 . as is shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the particle production can be strongly enhanced due to parametric resonance . for an unsuppressed production",
    "it is essential that the resonance is broad .",
    "the corresponding condition has the form : @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the inflaton mass , and @xmath41 is the magnitude of the inflaton field at the end of inflation in our model .",
    "one can consider @xmath42 also as the initial amplitude of the inflaton oscillations .",
    "the condition ( [ broadres ] ) is true for the wide range of coupling constant , @xmath43 .    because of resonance ( [ broadres ] )",
    ", very heavy @xmath37-bosons with masses even of gut scale @xmath44 gev can be produced under quite reasonable assumption @xmath45 @xcite . moreover in this case of comparatively large coupling constant @xmath45 the decay of the inflaton field occurs very rapidly , during only one or few oscillations .",
    "let us assume that the produced @xmath37-bosons in turn decay into fermions , for example , into quark - quark and antiquark - antilepton pairs , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "if the corresponding coupling constants are large enough , the @xmath37-bosons decay very quickly . therefore , the field @xmath48 may remain non - zero yet to the moment when @xmath37-bosons have been completely decayed , indeed @xmath49 gev at @xmath50 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : chi ] ) .",
    "the field @xmath2 is real and pseudoscalar and interacts with the produced fermions as ( cf .",
    "( [ l - ferm ] ) ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the fermion flavor ( sum over repetitive indices is assumed ) , @xmath54 , @xmath55 . from the hermicity of the interaction it follows that @xmath56 is real for @xmath57 , and @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "since @xmath2 is supposed to be electrically neutral , it interacts with quarks with the same electric charge , so @xmath52 and @xmath53 either run over @xmath60 or @xmath61 and there are no cross terms .    the lagrangian of free fermions can be written as follows @xmath62    therefore , the sum of @xmath63 and @xmath64 can be presented in matrix form as @xmath65 here @xmath66 is a non - hermitian matrix , whereas @xmath67 and @xmath68 are hermitian ones .",
    "using simultaneously two unitary transformations @xmath69 and @xmath70 one can always diagonalize the mass matrix in ( [ l - ferm - free - chi ] ) .",
    "therefore , the interaction of fermions with pseudoscalar field @xmath2 can be `` rotated away '' ( the elements of transformation matrices @xmath71 and @xmath72 must depend on the magnitude of @xmath2 in this case ) , and the lagrangian ( [ l - ferm - free - chi ] ) takes the simple form @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the mass eigenstates and correspondingly @xmath76 is diagonal matrix with real diagonal elements .    quite similarly one can transform into mass term the interaction of fermions with any scalar @xmath77 and pseudoscalar @xmath78 fields .",
    "however , the interaction of fermions with vector ( gauge ) boson @xmath37 remains the same under these transformations : @xmath79 here @xmath80 and @xmath81 are matrices of coupling constants in mass eigenstate basis , so @xmath74 describes @xmath82-th sort of fermion with definite mass . the constants @xmath83 are complex in general case , and if there are at least three species of fermions , one can not rotate away simultaneously all phases in complex matrices @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the complexity of the coupling constants means that @xmath1 is violated in the @xmath37-boson decays @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of this @xmath1 violation depends on the value of the field @xmath2 through the matrices @xmath85 and coupling constants @xmath84 . since @xmath2 is essentially non - zero after the end of inflation and during baryogenesis",
    ", the @xmath1-odd effects can be large enough .",
    "we assume also that gauge interactions involve fermions with certain chirality , see ( [ vecint ] ) , and thus these interactions break @xmath0-invariance .    @xmath0 and @xmath1 violation is one of the necessary sakharov conditions of generation of baryon asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "the another one is baryon number violation , so one needs to assume also that in the decays of @xmath37-bosons the baryon number is not conserved .",
    "let @xmath86 be the baryon asymmetry generated in the decay of one @xmath37-boson .",
    "then it can be easily demonstrated @xcite that the ratio of the baryon number density to the entropy density is estimated as @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are typical coupling constants of @xmath37-boson with fermions and inflaton , respectively , @xmath90 is mass scale of the theory .",
    "it is quite reasonable to believe that @xmath91 and @xmath92 , so one has @xmath93 .",
    "thus , to get observed value @xmath94 it is sufficient to have only @xmath95 .",
    "such small @xmath86 seems to be easily produced in the decay of @xmath37-boson .",
    "therefore , the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be generated in the decays of @xmath37-bosons , without fine tuning of parameters of the theory .",
    "we have to stress that the baryogenesis should proceed after the end of inflation ( as it has been already mentioned above ) . otherwise the baryon asymmetry would be strongly diluted by the universe ( re)heating .",
    "when inflation was over , the field @xmath2 evolved down to @xmath96 and so @xmath2 was not equal to constant @xmath97 but had considerably smaller and time dependent value .",
    "however , since at this stage @xmath48 changed very slowly one can repeat the above arguments with adiabatically evolving @xmath98 .",
    "if baryogenesis proceeded faster than @xmath2 evolved , then the effective amplitude of @xmath1 violation might be considered as a constant and the corresponding mass matrix could be diagonalized in the same way as it has been done above .",
    "the phase of the mass matrix would be unsuppressed if @xmath99 was close to the value of the bare quark mass . evidently in this case",
    "the imaginary part of the mass matrix would be of the same order of magnitude as the real part .",
    "we have presented here a model of baryogenesis which may lead to baryo - symmetric universe with cosmologically large domains of matter and antimatter , avoiding the domain wall problem .",
    "the model satisfies three sakharov criteria for successful baryogenesis : non - conservation of the baryon number , deviation from thermal equilibrium , and @xmath0 and @xmath1 violation . however , the latter is different from the normally exploited one . breaking of charge symmetry",
    "is induced by a non - zero amplitude of a scalar field @xmath2 , which slowly relaxed down to equilibrium , much slower than the process of baryogenesis goes on . in classification of different types of @xmath1 violation which might be operative in cosmology this type",
    "is called dynamical one  @xcite . later , after the baryon asymmetry was developed , @xmath2 evolved down to the equilibrium point @xmath96 and thus domain walls disappeared rather early in the universe .",
    "inflation is an essential ingredient of the scenario .",
    "a coupling to the inflaton field was introduced on purpose to generate a non - zero value of @xmath2 and to keep it non - zero during baryogenesis .",
    "the model allows for successful baryo - symmetric cosmology without yet being drawn into astronomical controversy .",
