    "spin accumulation ( spin splitting of the electrochemical potential ) is a nonequilibrium phenomenon which is associated with a spatially nonuniform spin asymmetry of two spin channels for electronic transport  @xcite . in the simplest case , it appears at the interface between ferromagnetic and non - magnetic metals , when current has a nonzero component perpendicular to the interface  @xcite .",
    "spin accumulation also appears in more complex systems , like single or double spin valves exhibiting current - perpendicular - to - plane giant magnetoresistance ( cpp - gmr )  @xcite effect , as well as in single or double tunnel junctions .",
    "current - induced spin accumulation is particularly pronounced in spin - polarized transport through nanoparticles  @xcite or quantum dots and molecules  @xcite .    in the case of spin valves based on layered magnetic structures , spin accumulation and gmr",
    "are usually accounted for in terms of the valet - fert description  @xcite , in which the spin accumulation is linear in current , while resistance and magnetoresistance are independent of current magnitude and current orientation .",
    "the description involves a number of phenomenological parameters which usually are taken from cpp - gmr experimental data .",
    "originally , it was formulated for collinear ( parallel and antiparallel ) magnetic configurations , but later was extended to describe also current induced spin torque  @xcite and cpp - gmr for arbitrary noncollinear geometry  @xcite .",
    "the valet - fert description was successfully applied not only to single spin valves , but also to double ( dual ) spin valves  @xcite , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a magnetically free layer separated from two magnetically fixed outer layers ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) by nonmagnetic spacers ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "an important feature of such structures is an enhanced spin accumulation in the central layer ( @xmath1 ) for antiparallel magnetizations of the outer magnetic layers ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "spin accumulation may be then several times larger than in the corresponding single spin valves .",
    "accordingly , such a magnetic configuration of dual spin valves ( dsvs ) diminishes the critical current needed to switch magnetic moment of the central layer , and also enhances the current - induced spin dynamics  @xcite .     and @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath1 is the central magnetic layer . ]",
    "another interesting consequence of the enhanced spin accumulation in the central layer of a dual spin valve is the possibility of nonlinear transport effects .",
    "recent experimental results  @xcite indicate that the enhanced spin accumulation may cause unusual dependence of magnetoresistance on dc current .",
    "it has been shown that when magnetizations of the outer layers are antiparallel , resistance of a dsv for one current orientation is lower when the @xmath1 layer is magnetized along the @xmath3 one and higher when it is aligned along magnetization of the @xmath2 layer , while for the opposite current orientation the situation is reversed . moreover , the difference in resistance of both collinear configurations markedly depends on the applied current .",
    "these observations strongly differ from the predictions of the valet - fert model  @xcite , which gives resistance ( and magnetoresistance ) independent of the current density",
    ".    such a nonlinear behavior may originate from several reasons .",
    "the valet - fert description is based on the assumption of constant ( independent of spin accumulation and current ) basic parameters of the model , like bulk / interface resistance , bulk / interface spin asymmetry , spin diffusion lengths , etc .",
    "this is justified when spin accumulation is small and/or change in the density of states on the energy scale comparable to spin accumulation is negligible in the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "density of states can be then considered constant , i.e. independent of energy .",
    "since the density of states determines electron scattering rates , one may safely assume that the transport parameters mentioned above are also constant .",
    "however , when the density of states at the fermi level varies remarkably with energy and spin accumulation is sufficiently large , this assumption may not be valid , and the parameters mentioned above may depend on spin accumulation  @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , may lead to nonlinear effects , like the experimental ones described above  @xcite .",
    "the spin accumulation , however , is rather small  of the order of 0.1 mev for current density of 10@xmath6 a/@xmath7 . thus , to account for the experimental observations one would need rather large gradient of the density of states with respect to energy at the fermi level .",
    "more specifically , to account the experimental observations , the change in density of states should be of the order of 10% on the energy scale of 1 mev .",
    "although this is physically possible , one can not exclude other contributions to the effect .",
    "spin accumulation can directly change effective scattering potential for electrons at the fermi level .",
    "moreover , spin accumulation can also indirectly influence transport parameters , for instance _ via _ current - induced shift of the energy bands due to charging of the layers or due to electron correlations , which are neglected in the description of the spin accumulation . since the experimental results show that the nonlinear effects appear only in the antiparallel configuration , where spin accumulation in the central layer is large , we assume that the indirect contributions are proportional to spin accumulation ( at least in the first order ) . since , it is not clear which contribution is dominant , we present a phenomenological approach , which effectively includes all contributions to the observed nonlinear transport .",
    "we assume that bulk and interfacial resistances as well as spin asymmetries vary with spin accumulation and show that such variation leads to effects comparable to experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "structure of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the model .",
    "numerical results are presented in section iii for bulk and interfacial contributions .",
    "section iv deals shortly with magnetization dynamics in dsv .",
    "finally , we conclude in section v.",
    "electron scattering rate and its spin asymmetry become modified when the spin - dependent fermi levels are shifted ( eg . due to spin accumulation ) .",
    "all the effects leading to this modification can be included in the description of charge and spin transport presented in refs .   and , which generalize the valet - fert model to noncollinear magnetic configurations .",
    "we analyze the situation when the effect originates from the bulk resistivity and bulk spin asymmetry factor @xmath8 of the @xmath1 layer , which are assumed to depend on spin accumulation , as well as from similar dependence of the corresponding interface parameters .",
    "let us begin with the bulk parameters .",
    "the spin - dependent bulk resistivity of a magnetic layer is conveniently written in the form  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is determined by the overall bulk resistivity @xmath11 as @xmath12 . when the spin accumulation is sufficiently large",
    ", one should take into account the corresponding variation of @xmath10 . in the lowest approximation ( linear in the spin accumulation )",
    "one can write @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the corresponding _ equilibrium _ ( zero - current limit ) value , and @xmath15 is spin accumulation in the central layer , which varies with the distance from layer s interfaces . to disregard this dependence",
    ", we average the spin accumulation over the layer thickness @xmath16 . in eq.([eq : rhovar ] ) @xmath17 is a phenomenological parameter , which depends on the relevant band structure .",
    "this parameter effectively includes all effects leading to the modification of transport parameters .",
    "this equation can be rewritten as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a dimensionless variable related to spin accumulation , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 denoting the particle current density and @xmath22 being the spin - flip length .",
    "we also introduced the dimensionless current density @xmath23 , with @xmath24 denoting the charge current density and @xmath25 being a current density scale typical for metallic spin valves ( @xmath26a/@xmath7 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhovar1 ] ) , @xmath28 , is a dimensionless phenomenological parameter which is independent of current .",
    "the bulk spin asymmetry parameter @xmath8 becomes modified by spin accumulation as well , and this modification can be written in a form similar to that in the case of @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the corresponding equilibrium value and @xmath31 effectively includes all the contributions .",
    "when introducing the dimensionless spin accumulation defined above , one can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : betavar ] ) as @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "similar equations can be written for the interfacial resistance @xmath34 and interfacial asymmetry parameter @xmath35 , which define spin - dependent interface resistance as @xmath36 analogously , we can write the dependence of @xmath34 and @xmath35 on spin accumulation in the form    @xmath37    [ eqs : interface ]    where @xmath38 is spin accumulation at a given interface . the constants @xmath39 and @xmath40 are equilibrium interfacial resistance and asymmetry parameter , respectively",
    ". relations ( [ eqs : interface ] ) lead to the following dependence of the interfacial parameters on the current density :    @xmath41    [ eqs : interface1 ]    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath31 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 introduced above describe deviation from usual behavior of the resistance ( magnetoresistance ) described by the valet - fert model .",
    "these parameters will be considered as independent phenomenological ones .",
    "to calculate resistance and spin accumulation for arbitrary noncollinear magnetic configuration , we apply the formalism described in refs .   and .",
    "this formalism , however , is modified by assuming @xmath10 , @xmath8 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 to depend on current density ( spin accumulation ) . therefore ,",
    "for a particular magnetic configuration and for certain values of @xmath46 , @xmath27 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , the spin accumulation has to be calculated together with @xmath10 , @xmath34 , @xmath8 , and @xmath35 in a self - consistent way . in the first step , we assume equilibrium values ; @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) , and calculate the corresponding spin accumulation @xmath54 in the central magnetic layer .",
    "then , we calculate the zero approximation of the out - of - equilibrium parameters according to eqs .",

    "the iteration process is continued until a stable point is reached .",
    "finally , for the obtained values of @xmath10 , @xmath8 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and spin accumulation , we calculate the resistance @xmath55 of the dsv at a given magnetic configuration ( see ref .  ) .    in all our calculations ,",
    "magnetizations of the outermost layers are assumed to be fixed and antiparallel ( like in experiment  @xcite ) .",
    "current is defined as positive for electrons flowing from @xmath3 towards @xmath2 .",

    "we apply the above described model to two examples of dsv structures .",
    "the first one is a symmetric dsv with @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and with the magnetic layers separated by @xmath58 thick cu spacers .",
    "the second considered structure is an asymmetric exchange - biased dsv similar to that used in experiment  @xcite , namely cu - co(6)/cu(4)/py(2)/cu(2)/co(6)/irmn(10)-cu , where the numbers in brackets correspond to layer thicknesses in nanometers .      in this subsection",
    "we consider pure bulk effects assuming @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we start from a symmetric dsv , and the corresponding numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sym_bulk ] .",
    "first , we analyze the case with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sym_bulk](a ) shows how @xmath10 varies when magnetization of the central layer is rotated in the layer plane .",
    "this rotation is described by the angle @xmath63 between magnetizations of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 layers .",
    "the higher the current density , the more pronounced is the deviation of @xmath10 from its equilibrium value @xmath14 .",
    "the current - induced change in @xmath14 reaches maxima when magnetic moment of the central layer is collinear with those of the outer layers .",
    "these maxima are different for the two opposite orientations of the magnetic moment of @xmath1 layer , as the corresponding spin accumulations are different . for @xmath64",
    ", however , one finds @xmath65 .",
    "this is because spin accumulation vanishes then due to opposite contributions of both interfaces ( for symmetric dsvs ) .",
    "variation of @xmath10 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sym_bulk](a ) is shown only for positive current , @xmath66 .",
    "when current is negative , the change in @xmath10 due to spin accumulation changes sign ( not shown ) , as also can be concluded from fig .",
    "[ fig : sym_bulk](c ) .",
    "the current - induced angular dependence of @xmath10 makes the resistance of the dsv dependent on the current density . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sym_bulk](c ) , the angular dependence of the resistance , becomes asymmetric , i.e. its magnitudes in the opposite collinear states ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) are different .",
    "such an asymmetric angular dependence qualitatively differs from that obtained from the valet - fert description , where the resistance is symmetric .",
    "when magnetization of the central layer switches ( e.g. due to an applied magnetic field ) from one collinear state to the opposite one , one finds a drop ( positive or negative ) in the resistance , defined as @xmath69 .",
    "moreover , when the current direction is reversed , the corresponding drop in resistance also changes sign , as shown in fig  [ fig : sym_bulk](c ) .",
    "let us consider now the situation where @xmath8 changes with the spin accumulation ( current ) , while @xmath70 is constant , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "general behavior of @xmath8 and of the corresponding resistance with the angle @xmath63 is similar to that discussed above ( see fig  [ fig : sym_bulk](b , d ) ) , although the sign of the resistance drop for the current of a given orientation is now opposite to that obtained in the case discussed above , compare figs  [ fig : sym_bulk](c ) and ( d ) .",
