    "an accurate knowledge of the physical properties of young stellar objects ( like their mass , age and luminosity ) is important to constrain theoretical pre  main sequence evolutionary models . the determination of these properties , however , depends critically on the availability of accurate distances .",
    "unfortunately , since distances to regions of star formation are often uncertain by more than 20 or 30% , errors on the luminosity and age of young stars are typically about 70% .",
    "significant progress has been possible in recent years thanks to very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations , particularly with the very long base array ( vlba loinard et al .",
    "2005 , 2007 , 2008 ; torres et al .  2007 , 2009 ;",
    "menten et al .   2007 ; xu et al .",
    "owing to the very accurate astrometry delivered by such instruments , trigonometric parallaxes ( and therefore distances ) can be measured very precisely if multi - epoch observations spread over a few years are obtained .",
    "vlbi instruments are only sensitive to high surface brightness emission , and can only detect objects where non - thermal processes are at work .",
    "such non - thermal sources must , therefore , be identified in the regions of interest before their distance can be measured using multi - epoch vlbi observations .",
    "fortunately , many young stars are magnetically active , and do exhibit detectable levels of non - thermal radio emission .",
    "b4v star s1 in ophiuchus ( loinard et al .  2008 ) is known to exhibit non - thermal radio emission , although theoretical arguments suggest it should be radiative .",
    "we will come back to this point in sect .",
    "this type of emission is typically characterized by strong variability , some level of circular polarization , and a negative spectral index .",
    "also , for magnetically active stars , there is a good correlation between x - ray and non - thermal radio emission ( benz & gdel 2004 ) so young stars with detectable levels of non - thermal radio emission are associated with bright x - ray sources .    in this work",
    ", we will focus on the star - forming region associated with the serpens molecular cloud ( strom et al .",
    "1974 ; see eiroa 1992 and eiroa et al .",
    "2008 for two recent reviews ) .",
    "more specifically , we will concentrate on the svs  4 region ( strom et al .  1976 ) , an infrared cluster of at least 11 pre - main sequence sources deeply embedded within the serpens core , and one of the densest young stellar sub - clusters known , with a stellar mass density of @xmath6 pc@xmath7 ( eiroa & casali 1989 ) . in the direction of svs 4 , preibisch ( 1998 ) detected a bright x - ray source ( @xmath8 @xmath5 4 @xmath910@xmath10 erg s@xmath11 ; preibisch 2003a ) now known to be associated with the infrared object ec 95 ( preibisch 2003a , eiroa & casali 1992 ) . using ir",
    "spectroscopy , preibisch ( 1999 ) showed that ec 95 is @xmath5 k2 star , and a comparison with theoretical tracks indicates that it is a very young ( @xmath5 10@xmath12 yr ) , intermediate mass star , presumably a precursor of a @xmath5 4 m@xmath13 herbig aebe star . as a consequence , preibisch ( 1999 ) argued that ec 95 is a",
    "_ proto herbig aebe star_.    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the distance obtained here is based on a trigonometric parallax measurement , and , therefore , does not rely on any assumption regarding the nature of the star , or the properties of the interstellar medium in the serpens and aquila rift clouds .",
    "there is no question that ec 95 is located at 414.9@xmath3 pc . on the other hand , we only measured the distance to that _ one star _ , whereas previous works based on indirect determinations ( such as those of straiys et al .  1996 ) relied on much larger samples",
    "one must , therefore , address the issue of the relevance of the distance measured here for the entire serpens complex . in this respect , it is important to point out that ec 95 is not just any star located in the direction of serpens . as we have seen earlier , it is a very young herbig aebe star .",
    "such intermediate - mass stars are not born in isolation , but as part of small clusters .",
    "since ec 95 is one of at least 11 pre - main sequence stars in the compact svs 4 region , there is no doubt that it is physically associated with that small cluster ( see also eiroa & casali 1989 ) , and that the distance measured here is also the distance to svs 4 .",
    "in addition , svs 4 is universally acknowledged to be part of the serpens core region ( e.g.  eiroa & casali 1992 ) , and its members ( including ec 95 ) have always been considered part of the serpens young stellar cluster ( eiroa & casali 1992 ) .",
    "thus , we argue that the distance to ec 95 measured here also provides an accurate estimate of the distance to the serpens core .",
    "we note further that the serpens core is only about 5@xmath14 across on the plane of the sky ( 0.6 pc at a distance of 415 pc ) .",
    "thus , depth effects are not expected to add significantly to the error budget on the determination of the distance to the core . as a consequence ,",
    "we argue that the distance to the serpens core should henceforth be assumed to be 415 @xmath2 5 pc .    with an angular diameter of about 3@xmath15",
    ", the serpens cloud is much larger than the serpens core . at a distance of 415 pc",
    ", this would correspond to a physical diameter of about 20 pc .",
    "the depth of the serpens complex is also likely to be of that order , and depending on the location of the core relative to the rest of the complex , the mean distance appropriate for the serpens cloud might be up to 20 pc less or 20 pc more than the distance to the core .",
    "thus , we argue that a conservative estimate of the mean distance to the serpens cloud would be 415 @xmath2 25 pc .",
    "this value is significantly larger than the figure reported by straiys et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the serpens molecular cloud ( @xmath4 = 259 @xmath2 37 pc ) .",
    "since the total extent of the serpens cloud on the plane of the sky is only about 20 pc , it is extremely unlikely to be 150 pc deep .",
    "instead , we argue that several unrelated regions are likely to coexist along the line of sight .",
    "as mentioned above , serpens is one of the many dust clouds forming the large structure known as the aquila rift .",
    "straiys et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have shown that the front edge of that structure is at about 230 pc , and that its depth is about 80 pc .",
    "the discrepancy between our result and that of of straiys et al .",
    "( 1996 ) could be readily explained if the serpens molecular cloud were not physically associated with the aquila rift , but instead located behind it . in this situation , since the method used by straiys et al .",
    "( 1996 ) is sensitive to the position of the first obscuring material located along the line of sight , it would have naturally picked out the foreground aquila rift clouds , rather that the more distance serpens region .",
    "indeed , in their concluding remarks , straiys et al .",
    "( 2003 ) state that _ both w40 and the serpens molecular cloud are seen projected on the very dark foreground created by the dust lanes of the aquila rift_. such a superposition along the same line of sight of different clouds at different distances is not entirely surprising since that line of sight passes only slightly above the galactic plane , but certainly warrants caution when considering individual regions in that direction .",
    "for instance , it is quite plausible that some of the patchy structures seen in the direction of serpens on optical plates are in fact associated with foreground material in the aquila rift .",
    "in this paper , we have presented multi - epoch vlba observations of ec 95 , a young stellar object located in the svs 4 sub - cluster of the serpens molecular core .",
    "our data demonstrate that ec 95 is in fact a tight binary system with a separation of about 15 mas .",
    "the primary ( ec 95a ) appears to be a 45 @xmath0 intermediate - mass herbig aebe protostar , whereas the secondary ( ec 95b ) is most likely a low - mass t tauri . at radio wavelengths ,",
    "the secondary is on average brighter than the primary .",
    "it is , therefore , also likely to dominate the fairly bright x - ray emission from the system .",
    "the primary , on the other hand , contributes most of the infrared and of the bolometric luminosity of ec 95 .",
    "this might naturally explain why the extinction to ec 95 based on infrared observations was systematically found to be much larger than the extinction based on x - ray data .",
    "interestingly , both members of ec 95 appear to be non - thermal radio emitters .",
    "while a low - mass t tauri star such as ec 95b is expected to generate that type of emission , an intermediate - mass such as ec 95a is not .",
    "we discussed several mechanisms that could explain the presence of non - thermal emission on ec 95a , and argue that the observed properties of ec 95a might be most readily explained if it possessed a corona powered by a thin , rotation - driven convective layer .",
    "the trigonometric parallax of ec 95 appears to be @xmath1 = 2.41 @xmath2 0.02 mas , corresponding to a distance of 414.9@xmath3 pc .",
    "we argue that this implies a distance to the serpens core of 415 @xmath2 5 pc , and to the serpens molecular cloud of 415 @xmath2 25 pc .",
    "this is significantly larger than previous distance estimates based on measurements of the extinction suffered by stars in the direction of serpens ( @xmath4 @xmath5 260 pc ) .",
    "a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that these measurements correspond to the distance to clouds associated with the aquila rift located in the foreground of the serpens cloud .",
    "since our observations resolve ec 95 into a binary , future radio monitoring of that system will allow us to measure the dynamical mass of that system .",
    "to our knowledge , this will be the first time that a dynamical mass is obtained for a young herbig aebe system , and it will enable us to uniquely constrain theoretical pre - main sequence evolutionary for intermediate - mass stars .",
    "the orbital period of the system appears to be 1020 years , so observations in the next two decades will be required to obtain an accurate mass estimate .    to serpens cloud is about 20 pc across on the plane of the sky , so it is likely to be also about 20 pc deep .",
    "observations similar to those presented here for a sample of young stars distributed across the cloud would help determine the structure of the region , and would allow us to further constrain the mean distance to this important region of star - formation ."
