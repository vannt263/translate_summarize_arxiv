    "one of the well - known ingredients of einstein s theory of general relativity is the covariant conservation of the energy - momentum tensor which leads , via noether s theorem , to the conservation of globally defined quantities .",
    "these quantities appear as integrals of the components of the energy - momentum tensor over suitable space - like surfaces that typically have one of the killing vectors of the space - time as their normal . as such , the total rest energy / mass of a system",
    "is conserved in general relativity .",
    "now the question is whether this is a suitable assumption as there is ( up to date ) no clear experimental evidence for this .",
    "hence , models have been developed that relax the condition of covariant energy - momentum conservation . in this paper",
    "we are interested in a modification of general relativity suggested by rastall @xcite . in this model , the gravitational fields",
    "are sourced by the energy and momentum , as in general relativity , but also by the metric of the external space . since in empty space ,",
    "i.e. for a vanishing energy - momentum tensor rastall gravity agrees with general relativity , this can be seen as a direct implementation of mach s principle stating that the inertia of a mass distribution should be dependent on the mass and energy of the external space - time @xcite .",
    "this model has been studied extensively in the context of cosmology @xcite .    at first sight rastall s theory",
    "has major drawbacks : its phenomenological formulation and in addition the absence of a variational principle .",
    "however , it contains a rich structure that may be easily connected with many fundamental aspects of a gravity theory .",
    "first of all , the usual energy - momentum conservation law of special relativity may be generalized to curved space - time in many different ways , including geometric terms .",
    "general relativity is one possible extension and constitutes a minimal implementation of such a generalization by replacing the standard derivative with a covariant derivative .",
    "this by itself is not completely free of unclear aspects . on the other hand ,",
    "if quantum effects are taken into account in curved space - time the classical expression for the energy - momentum tensor must be modified introducing quantities related to the curvature of the space - time @xcite . moreover",
    ", the propagation of quantum fields in space - times with horizons may lead to a violation of the classical conservation law ( due to the chirality of the quantum modes ) leading to a so - called _ gravitational anomaly _",
    "@xcite . in this sense ,",
    "rastall s theory is a phenomenological procedure to consider effects of quantum fields in curved space - time and to investigate in a completely covariant way such effects . even if there is in principle no action leading to the rastall equation it is possible to find such an action if an external field is introduced in the einstein - hilbert action through a lagrange multiplier",
    "this is somehow a reminiscence of the quantum effects described by the rastall equation .",
    "other geometrical frameworks , like weyl geometry , may lead to equations similar to the ones in rastall gravity @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in static , cylindrically symmetric solutions to the rastall gravity model coupled to the u(1 ) abelian - higgs model .",
    "these solutions constitute field theoretical realizations of a specific type of topological defect called abelian - higgs string @xcite which could e.g. describe infinite straight cosmic strings whose properties have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "topological defects are believed to have formed in the numerous phase transitions in the early universe due to the kibble mechanism @xcite . while magnetic monopoles and domain walls , which result from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a spherical and parity symmetry , respectively , are catastrophic for the universe since they would overclose it , cosmic strings are an acceptable remnant from the early universe .",
    "these objects form whenever an axial symmetry gets spontaneously broken and , due to topological arguments , are either infinitely long or exist in the form of cosmic string loops . numerical simulations of the evolution of cosmic string networks have shown that these networks reach a scaling solution , i.e. their contribution to the total energy density of the universe becomes constant at some stage .",
    "the main mechanism that allows cosmic string networks to reach this scaling solution is the formation of cosmic string loops due to self - intersection and the consequent decay of these loops under the emission of gravitational radiation .    for some time",
    ", cosmic strings were believed to be responsible for the structure formation in the universe .",
    "new cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data clearly shows that the theoretical power spectrum associated to cosmic strings is in stark contrast to the observed power spectrum .",
    "however , other effects might be caused by moving cosmic strings that can potentially be observed in the cmb data ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "moreover , there has been a recent revival of cosmic strings since it is now believed that cosmic strings might be linked to the fundamental strings of string theory @xcite .",
    "while perturbative fundamental strings were excluded to be observable on cosmic scales for many reasons @xcite , there are now new theories containing extra dimensions , so - called brane world model , that allow to lower the fundamental planck scale down to the tev scale .",
    "moreover , cosmic strings are interesting due to the recent bicep2 data @xcite that showed evidence for a b - mode polarization at small @xmath2 in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "while topological defects can not be accounted for the b - mode polarization alone @xcite it has been suggested that this polarization results from gravitational waves , i.e. tensor modes , originating from an inflationary epoch in the early universe . if that turns out to be correct the question remains what the origin of the field driving inflation is and how it can be embedded into suitable unified theories , which are certainly necessary to describe the physics at the energy scales relevant for the inflationary epoch .",
    "now , it is interesting that cosmic strings generically form at the end of inflation in inflationary models resulting from string theory @xcite and supersymmetric grand unified theories @xcite .",
    "hence , it is conceivable that cosmic strings show up in the cmb and , indeed , cmb data ( power and polarization spectra ) are well compatible with a substantial amount of the total energy density of the universe coming from cosmic strings @xcite .    while field theoretical cosmic strings would always form loops when self - intersecting ( and hence providing a `` short - cut '' for the magnetic flux ) , this can well be different for cosmic superstrings .",
    "the question then is how these networks of cosmic superstrings loose energy to reach a scaling solution and hence be not dangerous for the universe today .",
    "one of the suggestions is that they can form bound states .",
    "since it is difficult to study cosmic superstrings with respect to the formation of bound states , the interaction of cosmic strings has been investigated in the context of field theoretical models describing bound systems of d- and f - strings , so - called p - q - strings @xcite .    in order to understand the lensing properties of cosmic strings ( and hence their impact on the cmb spectrum ) as well as the evolution of cosmic string networks in different gravity models it is important to study their properties in detail .",
    "this is the aim of this paper which considers cosmic string in the rastall gravity model .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] , we briefly introduce the gravity model proposed by rastall . in section [ cosmic ]",
    "we present the u(1 ) abelian - higgs model that we study coupled to rastall gravity .",
    "we present the set of differential equations associated with this system and give the asymptotic behavior for the matter and for the metric functions . in section",
    "[ numerical ] we present our numerical results . in section [ conc ]",
    "we give our conclusions .",
    "the appendix contains an outline on the procedure we used to derive the equations of motion for the matter fields .",
    "rastall s generalization of general relativity @xcite uses the idea of covariant non - conservation of the energy - momentum tensor and has been cast into the following form ( where @xmath3 ) @xmath4 or @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the covariant derivative , @xmath7 the energy - momentum tensor with trace @xmath8 and @xmath9 the ricci scalar . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are some coupling constants such that in the limit @xmath12 we recover standard einstein gravity .",
    "note that the equations above imply a violation of the principle of general covariance .    the equations for rastall gravity and the violation of the conservation of energy - momentum tensor then read @xmath13 and @xmath14 of course the constants @xmath10 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be easily related and @xmath17 corresponds to the einstein gravity limit .",
    "the equations and can be written in the form @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the christoffel symbols .",
    "in this section we would like to study abelian - higgs strings in rastall gravity .",
    "the matter lagrangian density , @xmath21 , is given by @xmath22 with the covariant derivative @xmath23 = @xmath24 - @xmath25 of the complex scalar field @xmath26 .",
    "the field strength tensor is @xmath27 , of the u(1 ) gauge potential @xmath28 with coupling constant @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 denotes the gravitational covariant derivative . finally , @xmath31 is the self - coupling of the scalar field , while @xmath32 denotes the vacuum expectation value .",
    "we define the energy momentum tensor to be given in the standard way by the variation of the matter lagrangian @xmath33 with respect to the metric @xmath34 note , however , that this is not linked to an action principle in which the variation of the total action ( matter plus metric ) with respect to the metric gives the gravity equations .",
    "the model we are studying here is a phenomenological model in which we insert `` by hand '' the non - conservation of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the symmetry breaking pattern is such that @xmath35 and the scalar field as well as the gauge field acquire mass : the higgs field has mass @xmath36 , while the gauge boson mass is @xmath37 .    by using the standard cylindrical",
    "coordinates @xmath38 , the most general static cylindrically symmetric line element invariant under boosts along the @xmath39-direction is : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are functions of @xmath43 only .",
    "the non - vanishing components of the ricci tensor @xmath44 then read @xcite : @xmath45 where the prime now and in the following denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath43 .    for the matter and gauge fields",
    ", we have @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is an integer indexing the vorticity of the higgs field around the @xmath48axis , i.e. corresponds to the degree of the map @xmath49 .",
    "in the following we will study only the case @xmath50 .",
    "now let us define the following dimensionless quantities @xmath51 such that @xmath43 measures the radial distance in units of @xmath52 .",
    "then , the lagrangian density , @xmath53 , depends only on the following dimensionless coupling constants @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the planck mass .",
    "the non - vanishing components of the energy - momentum tensor read @xcite @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 and the trace @xmath8 is given by @xmath59   \\   .\\ ] ]    now , since the trace of the energy - momentum tensor is independent of the @xmath60 and the @xmath39 coordinate we have @xmath61 note that this is not a consequence of the gravity model used , as it would be in general relativity , but rather a consequence of the particular choice of the matter content .",
    "then , ( [ conserved ] ) allows us to define globally conserved charges , namely the energy per unit length , @xmath62 , as well as the tension along the string axis , @xmath63 , in the usual way ( with @xmath64 denoting the determinant of the induced metric on spatial sections perpendicular to @xmath39 ) @xmath65 where obviously from the fact that @xmath66 we find that @xmath67 .",
    "note that we `` measure '' @xmath62 in units of @xmath68 .",
    "a quantity often cited when discussing the observational effects of cosmic strings is @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the dimensionful energy per unit length of the string .",
    "this quantity enters in both the expression for the deficit angle as well as the temperature anisotropies @xmath71 in the cmb . in our dimensionless units",
    "the quantity @xmath72 is equal to @xmath73 .",
    "we use the @xmath74- and @xmath75-components of the rastall equation ( [ mod_gravity ] ) : @xmath76\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath77   \\   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath78 component reads @xmath79 \\   , \\ ] ] which can be combined with ( [ eq_grav1 ] ) and ( [ eq_grav2 ] ) to obtain a constraint that is first order in derivatives @xmath80\\ ] ] finally , the modified conservation law ( [ mod_conservation ] ) reads @xmath81    for @xmath17 we can derive the euler - lagrange equations by the variation of the action with respect to the matter fields .",
    "this is not possible here , hence we `` read - off '' the equations from the conservation law ( [ conservation ] ) .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that in standard einstein gravity the conservation law holds _ on shell _ ,",
    "i.e. for solutions of the euler - lagrange equations . moreover , we require that the equations become equal to the standard equations in the @xmath17 limit and constitute a minimal extension of the given model ( see also the appendix ) .",
    "it hence makes sense to consider the following equations of motion for the matter fields : @xmath82 and @xmath83 note that these , indeed , reduce to the standard euler - lagrange equations in the limit @xmath17 .",
    "hence we have to solve a system of four coupled , non - linear ordinary differential equations numerically subject to appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "these read @xmath84 to ensure regularity on the @xmath39-axis .",
    "furthermore , we want the matter fields to reach their vacuum expectation values asymptotically .",
    "so , we require @xmath85      the behaviour at @xmath86 is determined by the requirement of imposing globally regular solutions . from the boundary conditions it follows for the metric functions @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a constant .    inserting this into ( [ eq_higgs ] ) we find the following behaviour of @xmath89 at small @xmath43 @xmath90 for @xmath17 this reduces to @xmath91 , but",
    "here the behaviour is much more complicated and depends strongly on @xmath16 .",
    "in particular we note that we have to require @xmath92 in order to have regular solutions . for the gauge field",
    "we find @xmath93 consequently , the behaviour of the gauge field at the origin does not depend on @xmath16 .      in the absence of matter sources ,",
    "rastall gravity reduces to standard einstein gravity .",
    "since the energy - momentum tensor associated with the matter fields in our model falls off exponentially fast and since we want the abelian - higgs string to be well - localized , we can assume that far away from the string core the space - time corresponds to a cylindrical vacuum space - time .",
    "now , it is well known that cylindrical solutions of the vacuum einstein equations are of the kasner type .",
    "hence , we would expect our solutions to asymptote to these such that the fall - off of the metric functions is @xmath94 where the coefficients @xmath95 and @xmath96 have to fulfill the kasner conditions @xmath97 with @xmath98 and @xmath99 being constants .",
    "the two possible solutions to ( [ kasner ] ) are @xmath100 the first set of parameters corresponds to string - like solutions , in which case @xmath99 determines the deficit angle of the space - time .",
    "the second set of possible values are the so - called melvin solutions , which are not of physical interest in cosmological settings , however are mathematical solutions to the equations of motion .",
    "the string - like solution then possesses a deficit angle which can be expressed as follows : @xmath101    the matter field functions have the following behaviour at @xmath102 @xmath103 and @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are constants and @xmath107 and @xmath108 correspond to the effective higgs and gauge boson mass , respectively . for @xmath17",
    "the higgs field reaches its vacuum value quicker than the gauge field if @xmath109 and slower if @xmath110 .",
    "the value @xmath111 corresponds to the bps limit . in this limit",
    "the masses of the gauge and higgs bosons are equal .",
    "now for @xmath112 this changes .",
    "the effective higgs and gauge boson mass are equal for @xmath113 , which is equal unity for @xmath17 and decreases monotonically with decreasing @xmath16 .",
    "to the best of our knowledge there are no explicit solutions to the set of coupled differential equations presented above .",
    "we have hence solved the equations numerically using the ode solver colsys @xcite .",
    "relative errors of the solutions are typically on the order of @xmath114 to @xmath115 ( and sometimes even better ) .",
    "the limit @xmath17 corresponds to standard einstein gravity . from ( [ eq_higgs ] )",
    "it is apparent that @xmath116 is excluded .",
    "furthermore , we see from ( [ f_r_small ] ) that in order for the solutions at @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is small , to behave like the solutions in the @xmath17 limit we must choose the positive sign .",
    "this means that for @xmath119 the parameter @xmath120 .",
    "however , since we need to require @xmath121 at @xmath122 , otherwise the space - time would not be regular , this leads to infinities on the right hand side of the gravity equations ( [ eq_grav1 ] ) and ( [ eq_grav2 ] ) .",
    "so , we conclude that we have to choose @xmath123 $ ] .",
    "for @xmath17 it is well known that the coupled system of equations admits gravitating abelian - higgs string solutions . in this paper",
    "we are interested to investigate the influence of the rastall parameter , @xmath16 , on the behavior of the matter fields and on the metric .",
    "since rastall gravity reduces to einstein gravity in the absence of sources our asymptotic space - time ( in which the matter fields reach their vacuum values ) should be a solution to einstein gravity .",
    "we can hence use the standard definition of a deficit angle given in ( [ deficit_def ] ) .",
    "let us first recall what is know about the einstein gravity case @xmath17 . in this case , it has been observed that the value of @xmath124 depends on both @xmath125 and @xmath126 and increases with increasing @xmath126 . at some maximal value of @xmath127",
    "the deficit angle becomes equal to @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath128 no globally regular string solutions exist , but only solutions with singularities ( so - called  supermassive \" or  inverted \" string solutions ) .",
    "these supermassive solutions possess a singularity at some finite value of the radial coordinate @xmath129 at which @xmath130 , while @xmath131 stays finite @xcite .    in fig.[profiles ]",
    "we show the behavior of a typical abelian - higgs string solution for @xmath111 and @xmath132 and different values of @xmath16 . for @xmath111 and @xmath17",
    "these solutions fulfill a bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) bound . in this limit",
    "the components of the energy - momentum tensor in the direction perpendicular to the string axis vanish implying via ( [ eq_grav1 ] ) that @xmath133 .",
    "this means that there is no gravitational force acting perpendicular to the string axis . in this limit",
    ", the remaining equations can be recast into the form @xmath134 a solution of this type is shown in fig.[profiles ] .",
    "decreasing the rastall parameter @xmath16 we observe that both the gauge field function @xmath135 as well as the higgs field function @xmath89 are stronger localized around the string axis implying that the width of the string decreases . at the same time , the metric function @xmath136 starts to deviate from its constant value of unity stronger and stronger when decreasing @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , the metric function @xmath137 possesses a decreasing slope at large @xmath43 implying an increase in the deficit angle @xmath124 with decreasing @xmath16 .",
    "this seems natural since the energy - momentum content is localized inside a smaller region of space - time .",
    "+    let us now discuss the value of the deficit angle , @xmath124 , in more detail since this is an important quantity when predicting observational consequences of strings .",
    "the deficit angle leads to gravitational lensing as well as to red - and blue - shift of photons towards which and away from which , respectively , the string is moving ( the kaiser - stebbins effect ) .",
    "strings ( if they existed ) would hence have an important impact on the temperature anisotropies of the cmb . it is often stated that the deficit angle @xmath138 . this is strictly speaking only true in the bps limit @xmath111 . in this case , it is easy to see from ( [ bps ] ) and the definition of @xmath62 that this relation indeed holds . since furthermore in this limit , the energy per unit length in the bps limit is @xmath139 we find that the deficit angle in this specific case is @xmath140 .    we have studied the case @xmath132 and @xmath141 , @xmath111 and @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "our results are shown in fig.[alpha05_string ] , where we give the deficit angle @xmath124 as function of @xmath16 .",
    "the function @xmath136 stays finite all along and varies only little .",
    "this is why we do not present any detailed results about it here .",
    "for @xmath17 the deficit angle has the known value ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "e.g. in the bps limit , @xmath111 , we have @xmath143 .",
    "decreasing @xmath16 we find that the deficit increases until it reaches @xmath144 at some value of @xmath145 .",
    "for @xmath146 the solutions have a singularity at a finite value of the radial coordinate @xmath147 with @xmath148 .",
    "the critical value for @xmath16 depends on the value of @xmath125 . considering @xmath132 , we observe that for @xmath142 the critical value is @xmath149 , while for @xmath111 we have @xmath150 . for @xmath141",
    "we find that the deficit angle @xmath124 stays smaller than @xmath0 for all values of @xmath151 $ ] .",
    "the results for @xmath132 are shown in fig.[fig_gammacr ] .",
    "for @xmath152 we find that non - singular string solutions exist for all values of @xmath151 $ ] . for increasing @xmath125 the value of @xmath153 increases , but reaches @xmath17 only exponentially slow .",
    "hence , we find that for all reasonable values of the higgs to gauge boson mass ratio as well as the ratio between the symmetry breaking scale and the planck mass _ regular _ abelian - higgs strings in rastall gravity can be constructed .",
    "as stated above , for @xmath154 and/or @xmath155 there is no linear relation between the deficit angle @xmath124 and the energy per unit length @xmath62 .",
    "we have hence also studied the energy per unit length in dependence on the parameters of the model .",
    "our results are shown in fig.[fig_mu ] .",
    "as is clearly seen from this figure , we have @xmath156 for @xmath157 . for the other cases , the energy per unit length still depends ( nearly ) linearly on @xmath126 and behaves as @xmath158 where @xmath159 is a function that depends on @xmath125 and @xmath16 and fulfills the condition @xmath160 .",
    "now , we find that this function is monotonically increasing with @xmath125 and becomes nearly constant for very large values of @xmath125 .",
    "for @xmath110 it is negative , while for @xmath109 it is positive in the einstein gravity limit @xmath17 .",
    "this function also increases with decreasing @xmath16 , i.e. moving away more and more from the einstein gravity limit .",
    "the increase is stronger for larger values of @xmath125 .",
    "now , we can make an interesting observation .",
    "if we choose @xmath110 , we can find values of @xmath16 for which @xmath139 , i.e. corresponding to the energy per unit length that the solution has in the bps limit in standard einstein gravity . in the following we will refer to this as a _ would - be - bps limit_. for @xmath157 this is true for all values of @xmath126 .",
    "for a fixed value of @xmath110 and @xmath126 we can then decrease @xmath16 such that at some specific value of @xmath161 , the energy per unit length becomes again equal to unity ( in units of @xmath0 ) .",
    "we find that the lower @xmath125 the lower we have to choose @xmath16 to achieve this condition .",
    "e.g. for @xmath162 we find that @xmath163 for @xmath164 , while @xmath165 for @xmath141 .",
    "we also find a ( albeit smaller ) dependence on @xmath126 .",
    "e.g. for @xmath141 we find @xmath166 for @xmath132 .",
    "hence , @xmath167 decreases with increasing @xmath126 .",
    "in this paper we have studied abelian - higgs strings in the context of rastall gravity .",
    "rastall theory touches one of the cornerstones of general relativity , namely the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the violation of the conservation law is parametrized in terms of a parameter @xmath16 with @xmath17 constituting the general relativity limit . in spite of its phenomenological character rastall gravity",
    "may be related to an effective ( and hence classical ) implementation of a gravitational anomaly that might appear due to quantum effects .",
    "our main purpose here was to investigate the impact of these effects on a field theoretical realization of line - like topological defects , so - called cosmic strings .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    * we find that singularity - free space - times are possible only when @xmath168 , * depending on the other parameters in the model ( the two ratios between the fundamental mass scales ) the solid deficit angle becomes equal to @xmath0 at a value of @xmath169 , * a bps limit in which the energy per unit length saturates a bound ( and hence becomes equal to @xmath170 ) does not seem to exist here unlike for the einstein gravity limit , where it exists for equal gauge and higgs boson mass , * a _ would - be - bps bound _ exists at which the energy per unit length becomes equal to @xmath170 , i.e. fulfills the above mentioned bound .",
    "however , this is not related to an underlying mathematical structure .",
    "our results are interesting because of the recently presented bicep2 data . if the measurements of the b - mode polarization are confirmed ( preferably additionally through other measurements like e.g. the planck collaboration ) we do have a window to the very early universe and the phase of inflation .",
    "now inflation seems to be driven by scalar fields and the question remains where these originate from .",
    "most unifying models that are able to model inflation predict the production of cosmic strings at the end of inflation . hence , it might turn out that if inflation took place , cosmic strings become a prediction rather than a speculation .",
    "since it is certain that the energy conditions at the epoch of inflation are extreme , we would expect that quantum effects play a rle ( even if one treats the gravity side classically this can certainly not be said for the matter side ) .",
    "rastall gravity is one possibility to model these quantum effects effectively .",
    "our results presented above suggest that taking such corrections into account could have stronger effects on the cmb due to an increased deficit angle .",
    "while in this paper we have studied string - like objects without additional structure one could also think of investigating strings with additional degrees of freedom inside their core .",
    "these could be in the form of fermionic or bosonic currents and the corresponding objects have been coined _ superconducting strings _ @xcite .",
    "since the stability of these objects is of huge importance in the context of the formation of loops of cosmic string , so - called _ vortons _ ( see e.g. @xcite for more details ) a macroscopic stability criterion has been developed @xcite and used in a detailed analysis for superconducting string solutions of the u(1)@xmath171 u(1 ) model in flat space - time @xcite as well as in curved space - time @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to study possible quantum effects on the stability of these objects and the rastall gravity model would implement these quantum effects naturally .",

    "<S> we find that the deficit angle of the space - time increases and becomes equal to @xmath0 at some critical value of this parameter that depends on the remaining couplings in the model . for smaller values the resulting solutions are _ supermassive _ string solutions possessing a singularity at a finite distance from the string core . </S>",
    "<S> assuming the higgs boson mass to be on the order of the gauge boson mass we find that also in rastall gravity this happens only when the symmetry breaking scale is on the order of the planck mass . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that for specific values of the parameters in the model the energy per unit length becomes proportional to the winding number , i.e. the degree of the map @xmath1 . </S>",
