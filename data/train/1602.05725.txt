    "mass is an important concept whose notion has evolved dramatically during several important paradigm shifts in theoretical physics , from its original meaning of _ amount _ , to _ inertia _ in newtonian mechanics , to _ energy _ in special relativity with the famous @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "mass was further developed by einstein and schwarzschild into an intimate relation with the geometry of spacetime in general relativity ( gr )  @xcite . in quantum world",
    ", mass pertains to an object s de broglie relation and compton wavelength in the nonrelativistic theory  @xcite . in relativistic field theories , the origin of mass results from spontaneous symmetry breaking with the higgs field seeking a minimum point of potential  @xcite , which was verified at the lhc  @xcite . from a group - theoretic viewpoint ,",
    "mass is a casimir invariant of the poincar group , hence labels the irreducible representations  @xcite .",
    "we here study the concept of mass with the classical gravitational interaction . in a theoretically independent way , there are three masses defined by measurement  @xcite : i ) the inertial mass , @xmath0 , enters newton s second law , @xmath10 ; ii ) the passive gravitational mass , @xmath1 , is the mass on which gravity acts , defined by @xmath11 ; iii ) the active gravitational mass , @xmath12 , is the mass that sources gravity , through the ( integrated ) poisson s equation , @xmath13 . in the newtonian gravity ,",
    "these conceptually different masses are assumed to be equal , namely @xmath14 . in gr ,",
    "the geometric foundation is built upon the equality of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( dubbed the equivalence principle  @xcite ) .",
    "the equality of @xmath12 with the other two is of debate in gr  @xcite . while bonnor found that , assuming @xmath15 , @xmath12 deviates by a few times from @xmath1 for a static sphere of uniform density under strong gravity  @xcite , rosen and cooperstock showed that there is only one mass for an isolated body when the gravitational energy is taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the importance of experimental examination of equivalence of masses was realized early in newton s era  @xcite .",
    "high precision tests of the weak equivalence principle ( i.e. , @xmath4 for non - self - gravitating bodies ) include pendulum experiments of newton , bessel , potter , and torsion - balancing experiments of etvs , dicke , braginsky , adelberger , et al .",
    "recent developments are putting the test into space with missions like microscope  @xcite , galileo - galilei  @xcite , and step  @xcite .",
    "in addition , lunar laser ranging ( llr )  @xcite and pulsar timing  @xcite probed the equivalence principle with self - gravitating bodies and limited the nordtvedt parameter  @xcite , @xmath16 , to be less than @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively . in a vivid contrast ,",
    "tests of the equality @xmath19 are fewer .",
    "we only noticed two experiments , by utilizing the earth s south - north asymmetric distribution of ocean water  @xcite ; but no subsequent analysis is published . ]",
    "one performed by kreuzer using a cavendish balance that limited the difference in @xmath20 between fluorine and bromine to @xmath21  @xcite , and the other performed by bartlett and van buren with llr that limited the difference between iron and aluminum to @xmath22  @xcite .    here",
    "we propose new tests of equivalence of masses with the remarkable stellar triple system , psr  j0337 + 1715  @xcite .",
    "various machine - precision three - body simulations are performed closely following observational characteristics .",
    "possible violations in the equivalence of masses are _ injected _ directly via equations of motion  @xcite , and recovered with a dedicated markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampler taking full correlations into account .",
    "our results suggest that the triple system has sensitivity @xmath23 to probe the difference in masses",
    ". it could improve the current post - newtonian limits by thousands for @xmath4 and millions for @xmath24 , and would represent the first test of newton s third law with compact objects .",
    "psr  j0337 + 1715 is a triple system consisting of a neutron star ( ns ) with mass @xmath25 and two white dwarfs ( wds ) with masses @xmath26 and @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "the ns and the lighter wd are gravitationally bound as an _ inner binary _ with @xmath28d that are , as a whole , hierarchically bound to the outer wd with @xmath29d .",
    "two orbits are very circular with @xmath30 for the _ inner binary _ , and @xmath31 for the outer orbit .",
    "two orbital planes are remarkably coplanar with an inclination @xmath32  @xcite .    an illustration of orbits is given in figure  [ fig : coplanar : orbit ] .",
    "it was simulated with the parameters reported in ref .",
    "initial conditions are worked out for mjd 55920.0 which is the reference epoch for all parameters .",
    "the three - body evolution under newtonian gravity is performed with the ias15 integrator in rebound  @xcite .",
    "the ias15 integrator is a 15th - order integrator based on the gau - radau quadrature .",
    "it uses adaptive time stepping , and keeps systematic errors well below machine precision over @xmath33 orbits  @xcite .",
    "the precision is very important for three - body dynamics , because the pulsar timing experiments spanning @xmath34yr ( @xmath35s ) have achieved a weighted rms residual , @xmath36s  @xcite .",
    "our numerical integration has to be more accurate than that in order to study tiny effects in the orbital dynamics .",
    "we evolve the triple system in 3d for a longer time than the observation in ref .",
    "@xcite , and then cut data keeping the part which corresponds to the real data span ( mjd 55930.956436.5 ) . a spin - down model for the pulsar , @xmath37 , is constructed with a spin frequency , @xmath38hz , and its first time derivative , @xmath39 . by projecting the pulsar s trajectory along its line of sight to the earth",
    ", we obtain the geometric delay of pulse signals ( i.e. , the rmer delay ) .",
    "together with the spin - down model , simulated times of arrival ( toas ) , @xmath40 , with @xmath41 the counting number of pulses and @xmath42 the coordinate time , are recorded .",
    "relativistic effects ( e.g. , the periastron advance , the gravitational damping , the shapiro time delay ) are not observable in practice yet  @xcite , therefore not included .",
    "the only exception is the transverse doppler effect due to the cross term of velocities for inner and outer orbits  @xcite .",
    "it is approximated as @xmath43 , where constants and the integral term , which is smaller by a factor @xmath44 on the timescale of the inner orbit , are dropped  @xcite .",
    "@xmath45 has an amplitude @xmath46s , consistent with the real data  @xcite .",
    "26280 toas are sampled from our simulation either uniformly in time ( _ uniform sampling _ hereafter ) or with fake observing blocks once a week with toas being separated by 10 seconds within block ( _ step sampling _ ) .",
    "a gaussian noise with a variance @xmath47 is added homogeneously to toas to mimic the observation uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "several noise realizations are simulated for each sampling method .     - \\rho_{\\rm    cor}\\log_{10}2 $ ] is a function defined such that it counts @xmath48 s in the limit of large correlations [ e.g. , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ; on diagonal , @xmath52 diverges.,width=340 ]    following the method in ref .",
    "@xcite , we set up mcmc runs to estimate parameters . to follow the fitting of real data as closely as possible , the same set of parameters",
    "are used , which include 2 parameters for the pulsar s spin - down , and 14 parameters for the size , the shape , the orientation , and the initial condition of two orbits ( details can be found in ref",
    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "the python implementation of an affine - invariant mcmc ensemble sampler  @xcite , emcee , is used to explore the 16d parameter space . in each step , we generate noiseless template toas according to 16 parameters that are being sampled by the kernel .",
    "they are compared with the toas generated before .",
    "the runs proceed the exploration of parameter space according to the difference between two sets of toas , characterized by @xmath53 ( for details of the markov - chain implementation , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we accumulate @xmath54 mcmc samples for each set of simulated toas , of which the first half are abandoned as the burn - in phase  @xcite .",
    "the gelman - rubin statistic is used to verify the convergence of different chains  @xcite .",
    "the 16d parameter space is marginalized to obtain the uncertainty for each parameter .",
    "it is remarkable that with the only input of the orbital characteristics and a timing noise , we recover all observational _ uncertainties _ for 14 orbital parameters  @xcite within a factor of 2 , except the difference in the longitude of ascending nodes for two orbits , whose uncertainty is off by a factor of 3 .",
    "uncertainties of the spin - down parameters are however underestimated , by factors of @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 , which could be caused by our simplified sampling method .",
    "it is interesting to note that the uncertainties of @xmath56 and @xmath58 are relatively large for psr  j0337 + 1715 , by factors of @xmath59@xmath60 , when compared with binary pulsars of similar high - quality observations with a comparable span , the number of toas , and the timing residual ; see e.g. , psrs  j0737@xmath613039a  @xcite and j0348 + 0432  @xcite .",
    "the correlations between 16 parameters are plotted in figure  [ fig : corr : uniform ] for simulated toas with _",
    "uniform sampling_. the largest correlation comes from the time of ascending node and the orbital period for the outer orbit which , we suspect , is related to the small number ( @xmath62 ) of orbital coverage , that makes the variables of the outer orbit likely correlated ( see the green @xmath63 sub - block in figure  [ fig : corr : uniform ] ) .",
    "the correlation matrices for different noise realizations are hardly distinguishable , and those for _",
    "step sampling _ are fully consistent with figure  [ fig : corr : uniform ] .",
    "the discovery of the triple pulsar has triggered some studies in tests of the strong equivalence principle ( i.e. @xmath4 for self - gravitating bodies )  @xcite .",
    "preliminary results showed that it probes the difference in @xmath64 between nss and wds at @xmath65@xmath66  @xcite .",
    "the square kilometre array will improve that further and limit the scalar - tensor gravity stringently  @xcite .",
    "no detailed analysis has been published yet .",
    "here we perform such a study .",
    "in addition to @xmath4 , a new test is proposed to study the possibility of @xmath67 . because newton s third law is violated if @xmath67  @xcite , it is the first test of the famous @xmath68 formalism with strongly self - gravitating bodies .",
    "the two wds in the triple system are assumed to have a similar strength in violating the equivalence of masses .",
    "the equivalence - violating parameters are defined as , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "corresponding modifications to the gravitational interaction are added to the ias15 integrator  @xcite , via @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "further analysis shows that one @xmath76 can be set to vanish , which is related to an unobservable rescaling .",
    "we choose to set @xmath77 .",
    "consequently , the remaining three @xmath76 s should be interpreted as the difference in the mass ratio relative to @xmath78 .",
    "figure  [ fig : diff : grav ] shows examples of the difference in simulated toas with the equivalence violation , with respect to toas that are simulated with newtonian gravity . with @xmath76 s of @xmath66@xmath79 ,",
    "the effects on toas are already _ much _ larger than the achieved timing residual . however , the correlation with orbital elements is strong . in order to assess the true sensitivity of the triple pulsar , a simultaneous fitting of @xmath76 s with other parameters is _",
    "necessary_.    we probe the sensitivity of psr  j0337 + 1715 in constraining @xmath76 s by adding a nonzero @xmath76 in the parameter - estimation process .",
    "fake toas are simulated as before .",
    "template toas are generated with the possibility of allowing a nonvanishing @xmath76 .",
    "because of the strong mutual correlations ( see figure  [ fig : diff : grav ] ) , we are not able to estimate three @xmath76 s at one time.s are tried , but the convergence is very bad after a long mcmc run . ] instead , they are analyzed separately .",
    "320000 mcmc samples are accumulated for each set of simulated toas for each @xmath76 . after dropping the first half burn - in runs and marginalizing over 16 parameters ,",
    "we obtain the _ posteriori _ probability density functions ( pdfs ) for @xmath76 s .",
    "different noise realizations give consistent results .",
    "one example is shown in figure  [ fig : hist : noinjection ] .",
    "the region that is excluded by both sampling methods is conservatively taken as the exclusion region .",
    "we conclude that , the data quality of psr  j0337 + 1715 presented in ref .",
    "@xcite allows one to constrain @xmath80 s to @xmath81 . because , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : force ] ) , all @xmath76 s modify the trajectories in a similar way , it is not surprising that they are to be constrained with a similar precision .",
    ".,width=340 ]    in addition to _ constrain _ the equivalence violation in masses , the capability of psr  j0337 + 1715 to _ detect _ such violations , if they indeed exist , is also investigated .",
    "we _ inject _ nonvanishing @xmath76 s into our simulated toas by modifying the orbital dynamics according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : force ] ) .",
    "the same parameter - estimation process by allowing one nonzero @xmath76 is performed with these toas .",

    "the equivalence of masses is vital to gravity theories . already with",
    "the _ metric theories of gravity _ that fulfill the einstein s equivalence principle  @xcite , three conceptually different masses are distinguishable .",
    "for example , in the parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) formalism  @xcite , @xmath85 @xmath86 where we have set ppn parameters @xmath87 , due to their tight limits ( @xmath88 for @xmath89 , @xmath90  @xcite ; @xmath91 for @xmath92  @xcite ) . using @xmath93 for nss  @xcite ,",

    "the test would surpass the best test  @xcite by @xmath111 within the post - newtonian analysis , and would be the first test of newton s third law with strongly self - gravitating bodies .",
