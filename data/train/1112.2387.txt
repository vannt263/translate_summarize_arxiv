    "the top pair production and decay are the key processes for precision tests of the standard model ( sm ) ( see e.g. ref .  [ ] and references therein ) .",
    "they were intensively studied in the framework of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and electro - weak ( ew ) perturbation theory during last two decades , and various methods and schemes were proposed .",
    "the major goal of these investigations is to define the basic physical parameters of the top quark , such as its mass , width and couplings with other sm particles . in the past ,",
    "the top quark physics was one of the primary research objectives at tevatron .",
    "nowadays , the biggest attention is paid to the process of the top quark production at the lhc ( see e.g. refs .  [ ] ) .",
    "however , the highest precision measurements of the top quark properties can best be reached at the future linear collider ( lc ) which supposedly operates in a clean experimental environment .",
    "the top quark physics is one of the most interesting and challenging targets for future @xmath1 or @xmath2 lc experiments [ ] .",
    "the top pair production is followed by a decay chain with intermediate gauge boson states , i.e. the full process under consideration is @xmath3 .",
    "the widths of both the top quark and the @xmath4-boson are large , and one necessarily needs to take into account corresponding finite - width effects ( fwe ) . in the framework of the standard perturbative approach ,",
    "these effects are typically described by means of dressed propagators which are regularized by the total decay width . in order to analyze the full process of the top pair production relevant for phenomenological studies",
    ", we also have to take into account the background contribution coming from many other topologically different diagrams leading to the same six - fermion final states , which is a rather non - trivial task .",
    "the born - level cross - sections of the processes @xmath5 and @xmath6 were calculated in refs .  [ ] and [ ] , respectively .",
    "other exclusive reactions with @xmath7 and @xmath8 final states were considered in ref .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the contribution of the top - pair signal @xmath9 is dominant , but the background ( caused by one - resonant or non - resonant diagrams ) can be quite significant too . however , it can be drastically decreased by applying certain kinematical cuts on the appropriate invariant masses .",
    "the qcd corrections for the reaction @xmath10 in the continuum above the threshold were previously obtained in refs .  [ ] . as well as the one - loop ew corrections were calculated in many papers ( for corresponding references , see e.g. introduction in ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "concerning radiative corrections ( rc ) to reaction @xmath11 with six - fermion final states , the situation is more complicated and less clear [ ] . at the tree level",
    ", any of the reactions receives contributions from several hundreds of diagrams .",
    "the calculations of the full @xmath12 radiative corrections are very complicated , and different approximation schemes are typically applied .",
    "the most detailed analysis of the exclusive reactions @xmath13 and @xmath14 was performed in ref .",
    "[ ] . in this paper ,",
    "the cross - sections were calculated taking into account the leading radiative corrections , such as the initial state radiation ( isr ) and factorizable ew corrections to the on - shell top - pair production , to the decay of the top quark into @xmath15 and to the subsequent decays of the @xmath4-bosons .",
    "usually , such calculations are carried out automatically by monte carlo techniques ( see ref .  [ ] and references therein ) .    in this work",
    ", we consider reactions like @xmath9 with any four - fermion final states @xmath16 .",
    "the analysis is performed in the framework of the smeared mass unstable particles model ( below , smup model ) [ ] . due to exact factorization at intermediate @xmath17 and @xmath18 states ,",
    "the cross - section can be represented in a simple analytical form which is convenient for analytical and numerical analysis .",
    "so far , we have applied the smup approach only for unstable gauge boson production and decay ( see e.g. refs .  [ ] ) . as a continuation of our earlier studies ,",
    "in this work we test the smup approach for the case of unstable fermions , i.e. , specifically , top quarks . in our calculations , we take into account nlo radiative ew and qcd factorizable corrections which dominate close to @xmath0 threshold .",
    "also , we illustrate the influence of the mass smearing effects and various radiative corrections ( rc s ) on the differential cross - sections . the results are compared with ones calculated by using the standard perturbative methods [ ] , where cross - sections were represented for case of full @xmath19 process and , separately , for the top signal contribution alone .",
    "it was shown that in the born approximation the results coincide with a rather high precision , and deviations of the higher - order corrected results from the standard ones are at the percentage level .",
    "so , the suggested approach can be applied in a fast preliminary analysis of various complicated processes involving intermediate top quark exchanges in the standard model and beyond .",
    "note , here we do not consider the near - threshold effects caused by the generation of the coupled @xmath0 state , which were considered in detail in many previous studies ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "[ ] and references therein ) .",
    "we postpone this issue for a forthcoming study .",
    "the process of top - pair production with subsequent decay @xmath20 is schematically represented in fig .",
    "the full process contains two steps with unstable intermediate time - like states , namely , @xmath17 and @xmath18 states . in this case , as was shown in ref .",
    "[ ] , the double factorization takes place and can be described in the framework of the smup model [ ] . due to this factorisation",
    ", the full process can be divided into three stages : @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . here",
    ", the top - quarks and @xmath4-bosons are treated as unstable particles , and finite - width effects should be taken into account .    .",
    "]    the smup model cross - section of the first reaction @xmath24 can be written as [ ] @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the bottom quark mass ) is the threshold value of the top mass variable , @xmath28 is the cross - section of top pair production with random masses @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the probability density which describes the mass smearing of top quarks . in our calculations",
    "we take it in the lorentzian form as [ ] @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total decay width of the top quark with mass @xmath34 .",
    "the decay mode @xmath35 has a very large branching ratio @xmath36 , so formula ( [ 2.1 ] ) almost exactly describes the cascade process @xmath37 in the stable @xmath4-boson approximation . in order to take into account the instability of @xmath4-bosons we have to express the top quark width @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ 2.2 ] ) as a function of smeared @xmath4-boson mass @xmath39 with averaging over @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the model cross - section of the full inclusive process @xmath41 depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] has the following convolution form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ 2.2 ] ) . in order to describe an exclusive reaction @xmath44 we have to replace the total decay widths of @xmath4-bosons , which enter the numerator in eq .",
    "( [ 2.2 ] ) , by corresponding exclusive ones ( see section 4 ) . the same result can be obtained exactly if one calculates the cross - section of this process explicitly in the framework of the smup model by using dressed propagators of unstable particles ( up s ) . in ref .",
    "[ ] it was shown that exact factorization of a decay chain process with up s in an intermediate state takes place when we exploit the model effective propagators for fermion and vector up s in the following form @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the denominators of the fermion and vector boson dressed propagators , which contain corresponding total decay widths .",
    "the structure of numerators in eq .",
    "( [ 2.4 ] ) provides exact factorization and leads to a convolution - like expression ( [ 2.3 ] ) for the cross - section .",
    "so , there is a self - consistency between the model and up effective theory description of the processes with up in intermediate states .",
    "thus , the process with a six - particles final state shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is described by a simple analytical expression ( [ 2.3 ] ) with four integrations over smeared unstable top and @xmath4-boson masses .",
    "note , that the standard perturbative treatment of the six - particle final states in general case leads to @xmath48 independent parameters , from which 13 parameters have to be integrated over [ ] . such a complicated problem can be solved by using involved monte carlo numerical simulations only .",
    "the results of the smup model calculations are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . here , the dotted line represents the cross - section of the top - pair production in the stable particle approximation ( spa ) , i.e. without smearing of the top mass .",
    "the dashed line is the cross - section incorporating the top mass smearing or top finite - width effects ( fwe ) only , and the solid line gives the full mass smearing result , both top - quarks and @xmath4-bosons .",
    "note , that the second case corresponds to the standard treatment of the process @xmath49 in the stable @xmath4-boson approximation , and the third case  to the full process shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , one can see that the contribution of the top quarks fwe s is significant ( up to a few percents in the near - threshold region ) , while the contribution of @xmath4-bosons fwes is small .",
    "the comparison of our results with ones in the standard perturbative treatment shows that deviations are typically very small .",
    "for instance , it was obtained in ref .",
    "[ ] , that @xmath52 for @xmath53 is equal to 629 fb for @xmath54 and 553 fb for @xmath55 . for the same input data",
    ", we have obtained 630 fb and 554 fb , respectively , which are in a good agreement with the result mentioned above .",
    "this comparison proves the applicability of the smup model fermion propagator given by the first expression in eq .",
    "( [ 2.4 ] ) . in section 4 ,",
    "we make such a comparison for exclusive processes as well where both smup model fermion and boson propagators eq .",
    "( [ 2.4 ] ) are used .",
    "it should be noticed also that we consider the fwe s , which are significant in the near - threshold region , but we do not include near - threshold effects caused by possible intermediate @xmath0 bound states . since the top mean lifetime is considerably shorter than the hadronisation time , the bound state effect has no sharp resonant nature .",
    "however , it can be comparable with fwe s or mass - smearing effects under consideration , and this problem will be considered in more detail elsewhere .",
    "as it was shown in previous papers [ ] , the ew and qcd corrections give large contributions to the cross - section of the top - pair production at energy scales close to its threshold . in this section",
    ", we describe the strategy of our model calculations and give the total cross - section including the principal part of nlo ew and qcd corrections .",
    "note , that the strategy of calculations and the choice of input parameters are mainly caused and defined by the effective character of the model treatment . in the framework of the smup model , the instability ( or finite width ) of unstable particles",
    "is accounted for by the smearing of their masses , i.e. by the probability density function @xmath56 . in turn",
    ", this function contains momentum dependent parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 in analogy with the standard perturbative treatment which uses dressed propagators .",
    "so , in that sense the corrections of self - energy type are already included at the `` effective '' tree level , and it is reasonable to use an effective couplings , such as running coupling , absorbing the major part of vertex - type corrections .    in our calculations",
    "we have used the following input data [ ] : @xmath59 the running coupling constants @xmath60 were used in the one - loop approximation : @xmath61    the cross - sections are calculated including the following corrections :    * vertex and self - energy type corrections for stable particles are mainly included into running couplings ( [ 3.2 ] ) . + * self - energy corrections for unstable particles are included into the probability density function @xmath56 , which describes the smearing of up s masses .",

    "* qcd corrections to the top production and decay are described by the vertex multiplicative factor [ ] . + * contribution of the box diagrams to the total cross section was evaluated at energy scales close to the threshold by using numerical formcalc v7.3 [ ] routines .",
    "the higher order corrected cross - sections of the inclusive process @xmath64 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . there",
    ", the dotted line represents the born model cross - section , the dashed line  the cross - section with isr and the solid line  the cross - section with total factorisable corrections ( without box diagrams contribution ) . from the figure",
    ", one can see that the main contribution is given by isr correction , which significantly reduces the cross - section in the near - threshold energy range and increases it at energy scales above @xmath650.6 tev . at large energies ( @xmath66 )",
    "the contribution of ew and qcd corrections becomes significant and has to be properly taken into account .    .",
    "]    in fig .  [ fig4 ]",
    "we present the invariant mass distribution and illustrate the influence of various corrections on it .",
    "one can see that the corrections which we have taken into account according to the procedure above give noticeable contribution into this distribution in the peak area .",
    "we , also , illustrate such influence on the angular differential cross - section presented in fig .",
    "again , we notice that this influence is quite significant and should be taken into account .",
    "so far , we have considered the cross - section of inclusive process @xmath64 where the final state is summed up over all possible fermion flavors . as was noticed in the second section , in order to get the cross - section of exclusive process @xmath67 we can include the corresponding branching ratios @xmath68 and @xmath69 . acting this way",

    "the situation becomes worse , when we take into account all major corrections .",
    "the deviations increase and become up to a few percents .",

    "however , in the framework of the smup model , as well as in the effective theory of up , the higher order corrections have an effective character , and a consistent formulation of the perturbative treatment with this model is required .",
    "this problem leads to using the model propagators inside loop diagrams , but the validity of such a procedure has still to be justified theoretically .",
    "in particular , one should first analyze the asymptotic properties of the propagators .",
    "the analysis is not carried out yet , but it is in progress now .",

    "the production of the @xmath0 pair and its subsequent decay into six fermion final states in @xmath1 annihilation has been previously analyzed within the standard perturbative treatment in a vast literature . in this work , we performed the corresponding analysis in the framework of smup model .",
    "so far , this approach was applied mainly to the gauge boson production , where the structure of the model boson propagators was successfully tested [ ] . in the present work , we have tested the structure of the model fermion propagator , and the top quark production mechanism has been chosen as an important example .",
    "it was shown that the results of born - level calculations are in a good agreement with the standard perturbative ones , providing the applicability of the smup approach to the top - quark production and decay processes .",
    "the smup model provides simple analytical expressions for the total cross - sections of inclusive and exclusive processes with top quark pair production and its subsequent decay .",
    "it is a convenient and simple instrument for description of complicated multi - step processes with unstable particles participation .",
    "the precision of this approach at the tree level is of an order of 0.1 percent or better .",
    "the method gives a possibility to include , in principle , all factorizable corrections .",
