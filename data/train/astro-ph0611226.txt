    "theory suggests that supernovae and/or winds from massive stars existing in clusters confined to the disk of the galaxy produce bubbles in the interstellar medium which expand , becoming superbubbles , and burst out of the galactic disk producing collimated outflows into the galactic halo ( norman & ikeuchi 1989 ; tenorio - tagle & bodenheimer 1988 ) .",
    "the superbubbles , which create cavities in the atomic hydrogen gas in the disk of the galaxy , contain a plasma of hot gas , high energy photons , and cosmic rays ( crs ) . when a bubble s wall bursts at high latitudes the structure is termed a `` chimney '' since the cavity and its walls act as a conduit for the outflow of this plasma towards the halo of the galaxy ( see e.g.  de avillez & berry 2001 ) .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field that is oriented parallel to the disk of the galaxy is `` frozen '' into the plasma and is thus `` pulled ''",
    "upwards with the shell material as the bubble expands .",
    "consequently , it is predicted that these conduits should have magnetic field lines that run tangential to the shell ( norman & ikeuchi 1989 ; basu , johnstone & martin 1999 , hereafter bjm99 ) .",
    "an unusual , cone shaped void observed in neutral hydrogen ( normandeau , taylor & dewdney 1996 , hereafter ntd96 ) , which has the star cluster ocl 352 at its base , is one of the few observationally identified galactic chimney candidates and has come to be known as the `` w4 chimney '' .",
    "it was proposed that the region has been evacuated of  by the winds of 9 o - type stars that are part of the open cluster ocl 352 . in this case",
    "the stellar wind scenario is favoured over the supernovae scenario since the cluster seems too young to have had any supernovae occur and the energy output of the winds appears to be sufficient to account for the void ( ntd96 ) .",
    "estimates of the age of ocl 352 range from 1.32.5 myr ( dennison , topasna & simonetti 1997 , hereafter dts97 , and references therein ) to 3.74.3 myr ( ntd96 ) .",
    "we adopt a distance to the region of 2.35 kpc .",
    "the `` chimney '' region is located above ocl 352 and is a distinct component from the ionized `` w4 loop '' , which is located below ocl 352 ( normandeau , taylor & dewdney 1997 ) .",
    "we consider only the structure that is above the star cluster and above the ridge of ionized gas that defines the upper latitude structure of the w4 hii region .",
    "the hi images ( see ntd96 and figures  [ fig : hi-43.40_general ] and [ fig : hi-43.40_faint ] ) make it clear that the regions above and below the cluster , i.e. above and below the upper ionized ridge of w4 , are different in nature : the upper region has been mostly cleared of hi , hence the possibility that it is a chimney or a superbubble .",
    "the lower region has not been cleared , at least not at the same velocities .",
    "the interpretation of terebey et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and bjm99 that the superbubble structure includes the w4 loop is in contrast to this picture . while it is likely that both the w4 loop and the structure above w4 are powered by the same stars",
    ", they do not form one dynamical entity .",
    "the use of the term `` chimney '' provides a metaphor only for the part of the structure above w4 since a chimney not only has walls but it also has a fire at its base . in this case",
    "the fire is the ocl 352 cluster . to avoid unwieldy nomenclature , rather than referring to the structure as the w4 superbubble / chimney , we dub it g134.4 + 3.85 .",
    "the new name , however , should not be understood as implying that g134.4 + 3.85 has a different origin from w4 .",
    "indeed we will argue that both objects are thermal emission regions excited by the open cluster ocl 352 .    in the radio rgime , at galactic latitudes of less than + 4",
    ", the structure is reminiscent of norman & ikeuchi s ( 1989 ) conventional chimney model , i.e.  a broken  shell allowing crs and uv photons to escape to higher latitudes .",
    "the contrasting analysis of dts97 , using narrow - band  data , is that w4 is an `` apparently closed superbubble '' .",
    "however the dts97 data suffer from substantial vignetting at the field edges which could lead the eye to see a bubble shape where none exists .",
    "this makes corroboration from other datasets desirable .",
    "additionally , the dts97 data do not include velocity information , which means that the observed  emission could be from unrelated sources along the line of sight .",
    "bjm99 considered both the dynamics ( kompaneets modelling ) and the ionization of the superbubble based on the  data from dts97 . of particular interest here",
    "is the conclusion of bjm99 that an open geometry in  images and a closed one in data showing ionized gas are not mutually exclusive",
    ". the superbubble s shell could be sufficiently thin at high latitudes that , while it closes the shell and prevents streaming of gas towards higher latitudes , it does not hold back the ionizing radiation which then obliterates the  at higher latitudes .",
    "this scenario is in fact likely according to these authors .    in this paper",
    "we present new observations of radio continuum and hi emission , extending coverage from @xmath2 , the limits of earlier data , to @xmath3 .",
    "we analyze the  spectral line emission as well as the 1420 mhz and 408 mhz radio continuum emission from this region for evidence supporting either the chimney or the superbubble picture . for the 1420 mhz continuum data ,",
    "full polarization information is available .",

    "our analysis creates a picture of a _ fragmented _ superbubble , g134.4 + 3.85 , above w4 that may be in the process of evolving into a chimney possibly due to magnetic effects . while we use two separate names we believe that both `` objects '' are the outcome of the ionizing flux from ocl 352 , and are therefore in some sense just one object . in   [ sec : discuss ] we discuss this picture , superbubble formation scenarios , and the superbubble s connection to the galactic halo .",
    "the paper is summarized in   [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "landecker et al .  ( 2000 ) provide a complete description of the dominion radio astrophysical observatory ( drao ) synthesis telescope .",
    "the telescope is an east - west array of seven antennae with diameters @xmath49 m. of these seven , four are fixed and three are movable allowing sampling of baselines from 12.86 m to 604.29 m in steps of 4.29 m. at @xmath5 cm , this corresponds to coverage on all spatial scales from @xmath41 arcmin to 56 arcmin . the data collected consist of several components : spectral line emission from atomic hydrogen at @xmath6 cm , continuum emission at 1420 mhz with full polarization information , and continuum emission 408 mhz .",
    "the drao synthesis telescope recently completed phase i of the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps ; taylor et al .",
    "the cgps is a relatively high resolution ( @xmath41  at 1420 mhz ; @xmath43.7  at 408 mhz ) dataset covering 73.1  in longitude , from @xmath7 to @xmath8 along the galactic plane of the milky way .",
    "the latitude extent covers @xmath9 .",
    "three higher latitude fields , on an extension of the cgps grid , were acquired for the present study .    at 1420 mhz",
    "the field of view of the synthesis telescope has a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 107.2 . at 408 mhz ,",
    "the fwhm of the field of view is 332.1 .",
    "the survey region has been observed on a regular hexagonal grid with 112  between field centers .",
    "the 1420 mhz and 408 mhz mosaics used in the present study consist of 11 cgps fields plus the additional 3 fields observed at latitudes greater than + 5.6  having field centers 135.47 , + 5.85 ; 134.53 , + 7.46 ; and 133.60 , + 5.85 .",
    "the polarization mosaics contain the 14 fields described above plus an additional 4 cgps fields , which reveal more of the `` ambient '' galactic medium surrounding the w4 region .",
    "mosaics consist of the pilot project data ( normandeau , taylor & dewdney 1997 ) plus 3 additional cgps fields .",
    "since the minimum spacing of the drao synthesis telescope is 12.86 m , data from single - antenna telescopes are added to regain missing large scale structure . at 1420 mhz ,",
    "single - antenna continuum , total - intensity data are obtained from the 100 m effelsberg telescope ( reich et al .  1990 , 1997 ) for latitudes up to + 4 , and from the stockert 25-meter northern sky survey ( reich 1982 , reich & reich 1986 ) for higher latitudes .",
    "the effelsberg telescope has a resolution of 9 , whereas the stockert telescope has a resolution of 35 .",
    "the effelsberg data were absolutely calibrated using the stockert survey data , which ensures consistency amongst the contributions from the short - spacing data .",
    "short - spacing information is only added to the 1420 mhz total intensity continuum maps ( stokes i ) and not to the stokes q or stokes u polarization maps . at 408 mhz",
    ", short - spacing data are obtained from the all sky map of haslam et al.(1982 ) with a resolution of 51 .",
    "for the spectral line data , short - spacing information was collected using the drao 26-m telescope .",
    "the radio continuum emission at 1420 mhz is observed in four discrete 7.5 mhz bands centered at @xmath10 mhz and @xmath11 mhz from the  spectral line frequency of 1420.406 mhz .",
    "this leaves a 5 mhz gap at the central frequency , which is sufficient to avoid contamination from the  spectral line .",
    "the central 1 mhz of the gap is used for the spectral line observations .",
    "the four continuum bands are combined when producing the images used in this paper ( stokes i , stokes q and stokes u ) .",
    "taylor et al .  ( 2003 ) indicate that there is an uncertainty in the absolute scale of the 408 mhz data of up to @xmath415% due to uncertain calibration data .",
    "the internal precision of the data is unaffected by this error .",
    "the processing of all cgps fields and the addition of short - spacing data in all fields were carried out by members of the cgps data processing team using custom software developed at drao ( willis 1999 ; taylor et al . 2003 ) .",
    "processing of the additional , high - latitude fields and the mosaicking of fields were carried out by the authors using the drao software , with the assistance of the cgps data processing team .",
    "the higher latitude data were processed , calibrated , and supplemented with short - spacing data such that they matched the cgps survey data .",
    "mosaics showing the  spectral line emission at velocities of interest are shown in figures  [ fig : hi-43.40_general ] , [ fig : hi-43.40_faint ] , [ fig : hi-40 ] , and [ fig : hi-48 ] .",
    "the mosaics of continuum emission at 408 mhz and 1420 mhz , stokes i , q and u are presented in figures  [ fig:408 ] through [ fig : qu ] .",
    "the grating rings that remain visible in the hi and polarization data are due to the high intensity sources w3 and 3c  58 .",
    "the 1420 mhz data were convolved to match the lower resolution ( @xmath43.7 ) of the 408 mhz data .",
    "the polarization data were convolved to a resolution of 5  to improve the signal to noise ratio and the stokes q and u images were combined to produce a polarized intensity image ( @xmath12 ) and a polarization angle map ( @xmath13 ) ( see figure  [ fig : pipang ] ) .",
    "measurements of stokes i intensities and pi for 56 regions of interest are tabulated in west  ( 2003 ) .",

    "the eastern  wall of the superbubble is clearly visible up to + 5.5 , at which point it curves slightly inward and disappears .",
    "the western wall is only well defined up to + 3.4 . in the new data set presented here ,",
    "there is no evidence of a cap at high latitudes in the . at lower latitudes , the cavity spans 5 channels and lsr velocities 38.46 to 45.05 .",
    "we consider the region defined by @xmath15 , @xmath16 , the latitudes associated with the  shell described by dts97 .",
    "we assume that the cap would have a velocity width of 5 channels ( 8 ) , the velocity width of the cavity . averaging the signal over 5 channels",
    ", we could have detected a cap of column density @xmath17  @xmath18 .",
    "using 5 channels reduces @xmath19 from the value of the rms noise in a single channel , which is 3.3  k or @xmath20  @xmath18 .",
    "thus if such a cap had been detected its column density would be at the 6@xmath19 level .",
    "the observed column density in the top of the ionized bubble is @xmath21  @xmath18 . by comparison ,",
    "the column density of electrons in the dts97  shell is @xmath22  @xmath23 . for this latter estimate we converted emission measure into column density using an average of dts97 s measurements of 4 points in the upper shell , t = @xmath24",
    "k , their emission measure conversion of 1r = 2.8  pc  @xmath25 , and their shell thickness estimate of 10 to 20 pc .",
    "if there was neutral material associated with this  shell at a density comparable to that of the ionized material , we would not have been able to detect it .",
    "there is a small filament of  pointing upward , away from the plane ( figure  [ fig : hi-43.40_faint ] ) .",
    "this low level feature is present in four channels of the mosaic , from 41.76  to 46.70 . a line through this linear feature passes through ocl  352 .",
    "we will argue in  [ sec : chimney ] that this is material within the superbubble which remains neutral , protected from the ionizing radiation by shadowing .",
    "this faint arc is well below the latitude of the cap claimed by dts97 and therefore below the upper boundary of the best fit kompaneets model found by bjm99 .",
    "furthermore , the upper tip of the vertical filament is above the ionized cap suggested by the dts97 data .",
    "it is noticeable that the ocl 352 cluster is at the base of the cone , as was described by ntd96 , whereas the kompaneets model by bjm99 , which was fit primarily to the h@xmath26 image , shows a bubble extending to lower latitudes , to the base of the ionized gas loop which forms the lower half of w4 .",
    "this conical shape is not unique - something similar is seen at the base of the aquila supershell ( maciejewski et al .",
    "the w4 cone extends approximately 200 pc upward from the ocl 352 cluster , based on the well - defined upper longitude wall .",
    "this is comparable to the cone at the base of the aquila supershell which extends roughly 175 pc for an assumed distance of 3.3 kpc .",
    "the most surprising result from the modeling by bjm99 is the implication of a very small scale height ( @xmath27 ) , namely 25 pc .",
    "this value was obtained by matching the aspect ratio of the superbubble as seen in h@xmath26 using the kompaneets model and assuming a distance of 2.35 kpc .    using the data from the 26-m telescope , which extends further up in latitude , almost to + 10 , and fitting an exponential to the decay in column density ,",
    "a scale height of 140 @xmath28 40 pc is found for the  in the vicinity of the g134.4 + 3.85 ( c.f .  figure  [ fig : nvsz ] ) .",
    "a variety of different velocity intervals were used to test the robustness of this result , as well as different data sets ( 26-m data , cgps pilot project data , and cgps data ) , and all yield a scale height of approximately 140 pc , which is significantly larger than the 25 pc required by the model of bjm99 .",
    "this value compares well with the values of 135 pc quoted by lockman , hobbs & shull ( 1986 ) .",
    "apart from the contradiction with the prediction by bjm99 , this result is not particularly surprising : scale heights for the neutral medium are in the 100 - 200 pc range .",
    "clearly , however , although the fit of the kompaneets model to the shape of the w4 superbubble is very good , it does not address all of the physical processes occurring in this vicinity .",
    "in particular , magnetic fields may have contributed to the collimation ( komljenovic et al .",
    "1999 , de avillez & breitschwerdt 2005 ( see  [ sec : time ] ) ) .",
    "it should be noted that the scale height evaluated here used data from all longitudes covered by the available 26-m data , from 124.4to 144.4  with varying coverage in latitude .",
    "however , if only longitudes greater than those corresponding to g134.4 + 3.85 are used , the profile is greatly different for latitudes below + 6 , particularly between + 1.5  and + 4.0  where the high longitude data show a plateau instead of a decrease .",
    "the difficulty lies in deciding which profile is representative of the medium into which the superbubble expanded .",
    "the effect of including g134.4 + 3.85 itself in the longitude range is minor compared to the effect of what appears to be a partial shell at lower longitudes which may be associated with 3c  58 .",
    "these difficulties generate the uncertainty of @xmath28 40 pc associated with the 140 pc scale height used in this paper .",
    "gray et al .",
    "( 1999 ) presented polarization data from the low latitudes ( @xmath29 ) of this region .",
    "the high electron density combined with the magnetic field in the w3/w4/w5 region act as a `` faraday screen '' , causing the polarized , background galactic synchrotron radiation passing through the plasma to be rotated by the process of faraday rotation .",
    "these effects are observationally recognized as depolarized regions that follow the contours of the regions .",
    "depolarization occurs when the polarization angle varies by a significant amount between vectors contributing to a single measurement .",
    "the polarization angle can differ between adjacent lines of sight sampled by a single telescope beam ( beamwidth depolarization ) or vary along the path length ( depth depolarization ) . a third depolarization mechanism ,",
    "bandwidth depolarization , becomes important if the rotation measure ( rm ) is very high at the observing wavelength , and so the angle may change by a large amount across the observing band .",
    "bandwidth depolarization is not significant in this study as typical rms in the region are on the order of @xmath30  and to produce significant depolarization over the 35 mhz observing band of these observations , a rm of @xmath41400  would be required ( brown 2002 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : qu ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : pipang ] we see that the depolarization extends without interruption from w4 up the `` walls '' of g134.4 + 3.85 .",
    "this is seen in stokes q and u and in polarized intensity .",
    "the continuity of depolarization from w4 to the walls of the superbubble provides strong evidence that the superbubble is connected to the hii region ; this is not a chance superposition . a temperature spectral - index map ( west 2003 )",
    "also suggests that w4 and g134.4 + 3.85 are a single coherent structure .",
    "an unusual wishbone - shaped feature is visible in both stokes q and stokes u as well as in polarized intensity and polarization angle maps .",
    "this feature has no counterpart in stokes i , total - intensity .",
    "the feature appears above g134.4 + 3.85 with approximate center coordinates ( 134.9 , + 7.1667 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qu ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : pipang ] ) .",
    "the morphology of the object suggests a shell - like structure .",
    "a local steepening of the spectral index is observed south of the wishbone ( west 2003 ) .",
    "a bright , comma - shaped knot of strong polarized intensity with approximate center coordinates of ( 134.5 , + 2.58 ) is particularly prominent in polarized intensity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pipang ] ) but invisible in total - intensity .",
    "it is @xmath40.5  wide and @xmath40.2  high and has a peak polarized intensity of 0.46 k. the object appears near the base of the prominent v - shaped filaments which are visible in both  and 60 @xmath31 m iras dust emission .",
    "however , there is no clear morphological evidence of an association .",
    "the simbad database was searched for catalogue objects which might be coincident with the comma - shaped knot on the plane of the sky .",
    "a prominent object in this region is an o8 star , bd+62 424 with coordinates 134.53 , + 2.46 .",
    "there have been two , distinctly different heliocentric radial velocity measurements for this star : abt , levy , & gandet ( 1972 ) measured a value of 42.5 ( 40.2 lsr ) while fehrenbach et al .",
    "( 1996 ) measured a value of 9 ( 6.7 lsr ) .",
    "the measurement by abt et al .",
    "is consistent with the chimney velocities as observed in the spectral line .",
    "however , the radial velocity measurement of fehrenbach et al . ( 1996 ) yields a kinematic distance of @xmath4800 pc ( brand & blitz 1993 ) implying that this star is a foreground object .",
    "the high polarized intensity of this knot suggests that it may be closer than the w4 region as it suffers less depolarization than the surrounding region .",
    "to aid in comparison of the various wavelengths , a colour image combining the datasets is shown in figure  [ fig : colour ] .",
    "this image illustrates that there is correlation of radio continuum and  emission , but that the iras emission seems uncorrelated .",
    "the  regions w3 , w4 and w5 , the supernova remnants ( snrs ) hb3 and 3c  58 , as well as the spiral galaxy maffei 2 are readily seen .",
    "the superbubble , identified by dts97 , is much more apparent in these combined colour images than in the individual images . in fig.[fig : labelled ] we outline an egg - shaped bubble and suggest its three - dimensional structure .",
    "a feature that seems to be a continuous branch of emission coming off the main shape of g134.4 + 3.85 has been labeled the fork .    the new data presented in this paper show strong evidence of radio continuum emission above ocl 352 , associated with the w4 loop below the star cluster , and extending up to a latitude of @xmath32 .",
    "the emission seen at 1420 mhz and 408 mhz generally confirms the  dataset of dts97 , and reveals g134.4 + 3.85 to have a striking , continuous egg - shaped structure .",
    "in addition , the polarization data reveal a depolarized region consistent with the shell - like structure and indicate that thermally emitting material is depolarizing the background synchrotron emission ( see  [ sec : polar ] and  [ sec : best ] ) . on the east wall",
    "we see clearly that the ionized material ( whose position is judged from the depolarization feature in figures  [ fig : qu ] and [ fig : pipang ] ) lies inside the neutral material ( position judged from figure  [ fig : hi-43.40_general ] ) .",
    "the relative temperature spectral index is flatter within the region outlined by the depolarized shell and the value of the index indicates that this emission is thermal ( west 2003 ) .",
    "although the data suggest that g134.4 + 3.85 has a top ( we have already noted in  [ sec : hi ] that our observations do not have sufficient sensitivity to show atomic gas connected with the ionized material at the top of the shell ) , the shape does not have a uniform intensity around the perimeter .",
    "there are regions of lower intensity that suggest breaks in the continuous structure .",
    "two main breaks appear in the structure , one near the top and one on the lower longitude side near @xmath33 .",
    "these are seen at both radio frequencies and in  with closely coincident positions .",
    "the center coordinates and approximate widths for the two breaks are listed in table  [ tbl : breaks ] .    at 1420 mhz and in , there is emission , nicknamed the fork , that branches off the main structure ( figure  [ fig : contours ] ) .",
    "a faint arc of emission extends up from the high longitude side of the fork and appears to arc westward back to g134.4 + 3.85 .",
    "this arc of emission is coincident with the top portion of the polarization wishbone .",
    "the lower portion of the fork exhibits depolarization similar to that of the lower portion of the wall , suggesting that the fork is associated with g134.4 + 3.85 . however it is unclear whether the continuing arc of emission is associated with g134.4 + 3.85 .",
    "a hand tracing of the regions of higher emission including the fork and the apparent breaks is presented in figure  [ fig : contours ] .",
    "there is a distinctive region of very low continuum emission intensity inside the walls of g134.4 + 3.85 above @xmath34 .",
    "it extends up to + 4.8@xmath35 and spans @xmath36 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ivsb_ivsl ] shows plots of the 1420 mhz data at fixed longitude ( @xmath37 ) and fixed latitude ( @xmath38 ) . in both plots this region of very low emission ( @xmath39 k ) is evident ; in figure  [ fig : ivsb_ivsl]a the area runs from @xmath40 and in figure  [ fig : ivsb_ivsl]b the area extends from @xmath36 .",
    "the region has lower emission than even the regions exterior to g134.4 + 3.85 .",
    "this low emission region is most obvious at 1420 mhz but is also apparent in both 408 mhz and .",
    "there appears to be 60 @xmath31 m emission in this region from dust that one could reasonably expect to find in the foreground along the line of sight .",
    "the low emission implies either that the region is evacuated of plasma that would emit at these wavelengths or that , in the case of the  data , uv photons contained within are being absorbed by dust . in the former case",
    ", there would be lower plasma column density along the lines of sight passing through this region producing a lower observed intensity .    in this low emission region , there are two horizontally oriented filaments positioned at @xmath41 which were first identified by ntd96 .",
    "these are either foreground or background features , although , judging by their radial velocity , quite likely to be in the vicinity of g134.4 + 3.85 .",
    "they are unliekly to be within it , given the evidence that ionization extends to much higher latitudes .",
    "additionally , a ridge of  and 1420 mhz emission appears at @xmath42 to + 3.5 .",
    "the ridge at 1420 mhz is visible in figure  [ fig : stokesi ] .",
    "coincident with the 1420 mhz ridge is a flattening of the temperature spectral index and below this ridge but above dts97 point `` o '' ( west 2003 ) the spectral index steepens , indicating a shift between these two features ( west 2003 ) .",
    "this supports the picture of a lower region containing electrons and ionizing radiation ( at @xmath43 ) with an evacuated region above the ridge ( at @xmath44 ) .    to summarize , although the structure appears open in the  images , data showing the ionized gas , along with polarization and temperature spectral index maps , delineate an egg - shaped bubble with a shell that appears to be broken in at least two locations .",
    "the temperature spectral index map and  data suggest that radiation may possibly be constrained to the lower part of the bubble by a ridge that is evident in  and 1420 mhz data .",
    "rotation measures of extragalactic sources seen through the bubble were measured in an attempt to determine the magnetic field in the shell @xcite but the uncertainties are large and the number of sources is small , allowing @xmath45 to take any value between 1 and 24@xmath31 g . since rotation measure analysis does not constrain the magnetic field well , we use the following approach based on depolarization in the walls of the shell .",
    "we noted above that the walls of g134.4 + 3.85 are seen in our data as regions of low polarization relative to the surroundings of the superbubble and that they join smoothly to the depolarization region coinciding with w4 @xcite . from the observed degree of depolarization in the walls",

    "assuming a temperature of 10@xmath48 k , and using 1 r ( rayleigh ) as equivalent to an emission measure of em = 2.8 , and dts97 s result that the emission measure of the shell @xmath49 , then @xmath50 is calculated to be 0.44 @xmath28 0.19  for an assumed shell thickness of 10 pc , or 0.31 @xmath28 0.13  for an assumed shell thickness of 20 pc .",
    "the range of possible electron density is approximately @xmath51 .    for the following geometrical argument",
    ", we assume that the superbubble is cylindrical , with its axis perpendicular to the galactic plane ( and therefore perpendicular to the line of sight ) .",
    "its cross - section is circular , with outer diameter 80 pc and wall thickness between 10 and 20 pc .",
    "the line of sight passes through the cylinder of ionized material in which the electron density is assumed to take the values derived above , and the polarized synchrotron background emission will suffer faraday rotation on passage through this material if a magnetic field is present and has a line - of - sight component . the path length through the wall of the cylinder for adjacent lines of sight will differ , and",
    "so the amount of faraday rotation will differ .",
    "if the rotation is sufficiently different for adjacent paths within the telescope beam , there will be significant beam depolarization .",

    "u , and pi images ( figures  [ fig : qu ] and  [ fig : pipang ] ) the surroundings of g134.4 + 3.85 present a mottled appearance that is strongly suggestive of a non - uniform magneto - ionic medium . if we think of the medium as divided into `` cells '' in which the field and electron density are more or less constant , then the size of the cells appears to be about 20  in the surroundings . with a compression factor of 10 to 30",
    ", the linear dimension of the cells will shrink by the square root of the compression factor to about 4 .",
    "beam depolarization , which would arise from averaging across many cells , is then unlikely to be significant in the 5  data , and the geometrical effect we have proposed seems to be an adequate description of the processes leading to the observed depolarization .",
    "nevertheless , there is still a problem .",
    "at 1 , the full resolution of the observations , we would expect to see much less depolarization , both when the geometrical effect is dominant and when the bubble walls contain many cells , and we should not see the bubble walls as significant depolarization features .",
    "however , at 1resolution the eastern wall of the bubble is still detectable as a depolarization feature ( although the western wall is not ) .",
    "there must be some cells in the eastern wall as small as 1 , but we can not place a precise value on the extent of this small - scale structure because the signal - to - noise ratio at 1  is very low .",

    "in conclusion we note that bjm99 propose the presence of a swept - up magnetic field , tangential to the shell of the w4 chimney / superbubble , that potentially has a stabilizing effect on the structure ( by suppressing rayleigh - taylor instabilities that tend to break up the shell ) .",
    "kolmjenovic et al .",
    "( 1999 ) use magnetohydrodynamic modeling to argue that a _ vertical _ magnetic field of a few microgauss is required to explain a bubble structure that is so highly collimated , and to provide the required stabilizing effect .",
    "our depolarization observations indicate that a line - of - sight component of 3 to 5 @xmath73 exists in the shell . however , this measurement does not exclude the possibility of a stronger vertical component , giving a total field of 4 to 7 @xmath73 or larger .",
    "at our adopted distance of 2.35 kpc , the projected ellipse of g134.4 + 3.85 , which measures @xmath44  wide by @xmath46high , has physical width @xmath4164 pc and height @xmath4246 pc .",
    "it has risen to almost twice the scale height of the  , @xmath4140 pc , determined in  [ sec : scale_height ] , and at that level the density is only 13% of its mid - plane value ( figure  [ fig : nvsz ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the bubble has not reached the halo , considered to begin at a height of @xmath4500 pc @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional numerical simulations ( e.g.  maclow , mccray & norman 1989 ) and analytic theoretical explorations ( e.g.  ferrara & tolstoy 2000 ) indicate that at a distance away from the plane of about 3 scale heights a bubble will accelerate and break out into the halo , creating a chimney .",
    "not only has g134.4 + 3.85 not reached this height , it may not have the high levels of input wind ( or supernova ) energy to do so .",
    "most treatments of a single superbubble evolving in a uniform environment indicate that substantially more driving energy is required for breakout .",
    "for example , maclow , mccray , & norman ( 1989 ) show that a bubble driven by a mechanical luminosity of @xmath74 erg  s@xmath75 , more than five times the output of ocl 352 , will break out into the halo .",
    "tomisaka ( 1998 ) describes the evolution of a bubble driven by @xmath76 erg  s@xmath75 , equal to the mechanical luminosity of ocl  352 , and show that it is unlikely to break out , and , furthermore , is stabilized by the ambient magnetic field .",
    "mcclure - griffiths et al .  ( 2003 ) describe the galactic chimney gsh  277 + 00 + 36 , perhaps a counter - example to g134.4 + 3.85 .",
    "this is clearly a chimney , very empty inside , with very complex hi structures in the walls , interpreted as hydrodynamic instabilities . in this case",
    "the gas flow within the chimney has had a major impact on the neutral gas forming its walls .",
    "we see no such features in g134.4 + 3.85 .",
    "furthermore , gsh  277 + 00 + 36 reaches to a height of 1  kpc above the galactic plane , at least four times as high as g134.4 + 3.85 .",
    "g134.4 + 3.85 is either driven by a smaller mechanical energy than gsh  277 + 00 + 36 , or is at a much earlier stage of evolution .",
    "thus the data we have presented seem at first glance to support a picture in which g134.4 + 3.85 is a superbubble , not a chimney .",
    "the structure of ionized gas tapers at the top , suggesting convergence or closure . the 1420 mhz and  data clearly show this converging top , and , to a lesser degree , so do the 408 mhz data .",
    "there is no cap of neutral material at the upper levels in our  data . nor",
    "is there any detectable neutral shell surrounding the ionized one ; rather g134.4 + 3.85 appears as a cavity in the surrounding medium .",
    "the  images do , however , show the diverging conical shape exhibited by chimney models ( norman & ikeuchi 1989 ) .",
    "these observations can be understood in terms of the picture presented by bjm99 . in the upper reaches of the bubble",
    "the ambient density is dropping rapidly and the ionization structure is unbounded . all neutral gas has been ionized . in this picture ,",
    "any neutral gas found within the conical void must be protected from uv photons by shadowing .",
    "the prime example is the pair of filaments forming a * v * at @xmath77 .",
    "a second possible instance , found in our observations , is the vertical  filament extending from @xmath4(134.15 , + 6.083 ) to @xmath4(134.175 , + 7.25 ) and with a width @xmath40.25  ( see figures  [ fig : hi-43.40_faint ] and [ fig : labelled ] ) , which appears in several velocity channels from 38.46  to 45.05 , velocities which are consistent with g134.4 + 3.85 velocities .",
    "these features are linear , or made up of straight - line elements , and are oriented in line with the position of ocl  352 .",
    "although the ionized shell appears closed , our observations have also revealed two gaps ; details are given in table  [ tbl : breaks ] .",
    "these regions of low emission may well be breaks in the shell .",
    "one break is at the top of the bubble , at @xmath78 , and has an apparent width of 20  pc .",
    "the ambient density is lowest at the top of the shell , and this is exactly where one might expect the shell to be disrupted .",
    "the other break is at lower latitude , and appears to be larger , nearly 50  pc wide . in this break",
    "we see neither neutral or ionized material .",
    "we interpret these breaks as evidence that the superbubble is fragmenting , and turn to an existing theoretical treatment of superbubble breakout and disruption to see what might be learned from it .",
    "we base our discussion on the recent work of de avillez & breitschwerdt ( 2005 ) , who have made high - resolution , three - dimensional simulations of the magnetized ism .",
    "their calculations trace in fine detail the evolution of such a medium driven by supernova explosions at the galactic rate .",
    "while they start with a simple , uniform medium , their simulations follow the evolution into the more realistic situation of a medium that becomes highly processed as the result of stellar activity .",
    "the morphology of g134.4 + 3.85 is quite similar to some superbubbles shown in their figure 2 .",
    "a bubble has developed , centered at @xmath79kpc , @xmath80kpc , in which the higher density skin , rather than forming a closed shell , is open at the top and can be described as filamentary or fragmented .",
    "given its density , this skin can be identified as cool  gas if the region is in pressure equilibrium .",
    "interior to this skin is a more continuous lower density lining which could be identified with emission from warmer ionized gas .",
    "this bubble has protrusions of even hotter gas at both the top and side which would appear as breaks in ionized gas observations , remarkably similar to the breaks seen in our continuum data for g134.4 + 3.85 .",
    "the dimensions of the bubble are approximately 200 pc laterally and 600 pc vertically , somewhat larger than g134.4 + 3.85    because of this height , the model bubble can be considered to have reached the galactic halo at @xmath81  pc .",
    "it has been shown with 2-d simulations ( e.g.   maclow , mccray & norman ( 1989 ) ) , that , at this altitude of a few scale heights , rayleigh - taylor instabilities ( in which hot gas pushes into cooler , denser gas ) will occur and cause fragmentation of the shell .",
    "however , instabilities , rayleigh - taylor or other types , can occur at earlier stages , according to the 3-d simulations .",
    "indeed the dense skins of smaller bubbles in the de avillez and breitschwerdt simulation are also filamentary , indicating that this is so .",
    "although a magnetic field in the shell can stabilize it against rayleigh - taylor instabilities , de avillez and breitschwerdt mention that mhd instabilities can occur which will mix the magnetized shell with the ambient medium and cause the escape of hot gas .",
    "the field in the skin of their model bubble is a few @xmath31 g or less , and rayleigh - taylor instabilities would not be suppressed by this field .",
    "the ambient field around g134.4 + 3.85 is only a few @xmath31 g , but , due to compression , the ionized lining of g134.4 + 3.85 could have a magnetic field strength as high as 7 @xmath31 g (  [ sec : best ] ) . thus rayleigh - taylor instabilities may be reduced and mhd instabilities , instead , may be the cause of both breaks apparent in g134.4 + 3.85 .",
    "the simulations need to be examined in detail in order to assess whether this is the case ; de avillez has begun such an investigation in relation to g134.4 + 3.85 ( private communication ) .    in summary , g134.4 + 3.85",
    "has now risen into the lower density levels of the galactic disk , but not yet into the halo .",
    "its ionized shell is apparently closed indicating that it is a superbubble . at high latitudes",
    ", the  distribution retains the conical chimney structure , but that is because the ionized shell is transparent to ionizing radiation .",
    "gaps seen in the shell may well be the first signs of fragmentation of the superbubble and indicate that hot gas is escaping . if so , g134.4 + 3.85 is on its way to becoming a chimney .",
    "the process is likely to accelerate as supernova explosions among the stars of ocl  352 inject energy into the bubble .",
    "w4 and its immediate neighbour , w3 ( ic  1795 ) , together comprise a complex , highly processed sector of the galaxy .",
    "many authors have suggested that multiple epochs of star formation have occurred in the region ( lada et al .",
    "1978 ; thronson et al . 1980 ; carpenter , heyer & snell 2000 ; reynolds , sterling & haffner 2001 ) .",
    "in particular , oey et al .",
    "( 2005 ) offer evidence that ic  1795 was actually triggered by w4 and that ic  1795 has recently triggered the formation of three ultracompact  regions around w3 .",
    "given that this process is still underway , a question arises : is g134.4 + 3.85 simply the product of the winds from ocl  352 , or has it been shaped by earlier activity ?",
    "the axis of g134.4 + 3.85 passes through the position of ocl  352 , and there can be little doubt that this star cluster is now driving the evolution of the bubble .",
    "however , if winds from earlier massive stars swept out the environment , g134.4 + 3.85 could have extended to its present height relatively quickly .",
    "oey et al .",
    "argue further that the very low scale height ( @xmath425  pc ) deduced by bjm99 is the result of earlier clearing of the environment by a long - gone generation of stars .",
    "however , the exact alignment of ocl  352 with the axis of g134.4 + 3.85 suggests that the superbubble is not simply filling an old cavity , which would most probably have no such alignment .",
    "ntd96 calculate that the combined winds of the 9 o - type stars in the cluster could blow out the region up to a height of 110 pc in 5.7 myr which roughly agrees with cluster age estimates of 3.7 to 4.3 myr . in light of  evidence that the structure extends up to @xmath4230 pc ,",
    "dts97 calculate that 6.4 to 9.6 myr would be required to allow sufficient expansion .",
    "they cite cluster ages of 1.3 to 2.5 myr , smaller than those obtained by ntd96 , and thus claim that ocl 352 can not be solely responsible for the formation of the  superbubble . in passing we",
    "note that both the calculations of ntd96 and dts97 ignored magnetic fields .",
    "ferrire et al .",
    "( 1991 ) have shown that a bubble expands more slowly in a magnetized medium : an even longer time would be needed to reach the present size of g134.4 + 3.85 .",

    "( 2001 ) observe an  loop extending 1300  pc above the midplane of the galaxy and centered on coordinates ( 139 , + 15 ) , which they believe is being ionized by ocl  352 .",
    "they also suggest that mutiple star formation epochs have been involved in the formation of this loop , and suggest a timescale of 10 to 20 myr for the process .",
    "if ocl  352 is maintaining the ionization of material 1300  pc above the plane , then the region must be completely clear of neutral material .",
    "this is confirmed by our observations , at least to a height of about 300 pc .",
    "we support the suggestion that ocl  352 is the dominant source of ionizing radiation for g134.4 + 3.85 but that it is not solely responsible for the creation and evolution of the structure .",
    "further , we postulate that there is little matter remaining interior to the upper portion of g134.4 + 3.85 and that any gas that may have existed at an earlier stage of the life of the superbubble has escaped through the apparent breaks in the structure of g134.4 + 3.85 .",
    "we have presented evidence that there is significant magnetic field in the walls of g134.4 + 3.85 (  [ sec : best ] ) .",
    "ferrire et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , tomisaka ( 1998 ) , and de avillez & breitschwerdt ( 2005 ) all consider bubbles in the magnetized ism ; all conclude that bubbles elongate in a direction parallel to the field .",
    "tomisaka ( 1998 ) concludes that the field will inhibit expansion perpendicular to the field , and can also contain the expansion of the bubble .",
    "the expansion can still accelerate vertically , even in the presence of a field aligned with the galactic plane , but only if it is driven by enough energy to reach several scale heights .",
    "what then do we make of the _ vertical _ elongation of g134.4 + 3.85 ?",
    "either it indicates that the scale height is extremely low , as suggested by bjm99 , or it implies a field component orthogonal to the galactic plane ( as suggested by komljenovic et al .",
    "1999 ) . since we do not believe that the scale height is as low as the 25  pc derived by bjm99",
    ", we must consider the possibility of a vertical component to the field .",
    "such a component may be the relic of an earlier bubble and we are compelled by the very shape of g134.4 + 3.85 to consider that it may have formed in a pre - processed medium , not a pristine one .",
    "we can envisage a situation where a new bubble has filled an old one , and the elongation may have become stronger with each successive wave of star formation .",
    "this fits well into the picture of triggered star formation for this complex ( oey et al . 2005 ) where the new generation of stars is triggered within the walls of the superbubble created by the preceding generation .",
    "there is also useful insight to be gained from analytical approximations available in the literature . both ferrire et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and de avillez and breitschwerdt ( 2005 ) derive analytic equations applicable to a magnetohydrodynamic medium .",
    "de avillez & breitschwerdt ( 2005 ) calculate the age and the radius ( in the equatorial plane ) of the bubble when its expansion stalls .",
    "their expression for the age at stall is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the mechanical luminosity of the stellar wind in units of @xmath84 ergs@xmath75 , @xmath85 is the density in @xmath86 , and @xmath87 is the ambient magnetic field in units of @xmath31 g .",
    "the derivation of this expression is based on the assumption of a uniform ism and a regular magnetic field .",
    "the bubble stalls when the force from thermal pressure is balanced by magnetic force as the bubble distorts field lines .",
    "inspection of equation 2 shows that the stall time is very strongly dependent on the magnetic field but is less influenced by density or driving energy .",
    "if the magnetic field goes up by a factor of 4 the time to stall drops by 32 !    nevertheless , the time to stall is long .",
    "if we insert @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 ( note that this is the ambient field , not the compressed field , and that we use the regular component of the field , ignoring the random component ) , then we obtain @xmath91  myr , far longer than the age of ocl  352 .",
    "if the field is as high as @xmath92 , this time drops to about 9  myr , a more reasonable value .",
    "the radius of the bubble at stall is @xmath93 for the situation considered above the stall radius is @xmath41000  pc ( for @xmath90 ) and @xmath4250  pc ( for @xmath94 ) .",
    "g134.4 + 3.85 is nowhere near this size , and has not stalled .",
    "however , bubbles do in time stall .",
    "contraction follows stall , and occurs mostly in the equatorial region , so that old bubbles become quite elongated in the direction of the field ( de avillez & breitschwerdt 2005 ) .",
    "however , we have just demonstrated that g134.4 + 3.85 has not stalled , so the elongation can not be the product of contraction , but must be the product of an ambient field that already has a strong vertical component .",
    "we therefore propose a model in which g134.4 + 3.85 is driven more by pre - existing magnetic field structure than by pre - existing density structure ; this is consistent with the ideas expressed by de avillez & bretischwerdt ( 2005 ) .",

    "based on low latitude  data , the structure , named here g134.4 + 3.85 , was originally postulated to be a fully - formed chimney .",
    "later ,  data suggested that it was closed near @xmath112 .",
    "the radio continuum data presented in this paper show a structure similar to that seen in , though two breaks , one at the top and one in the low longitude wall , are apparent in the combined data .",
    "polarized intensity images , showing depolarization extending from the w4  region up the walls of the superbubble , confirm that the observed continuum emission and  emission are at the same distance as the w4 region .",
    "in contrast , the  data make it clear that there is no corresponding neutral shell .",
    "we speculate that one of the breaks could be associated with the thinning of the ionized shell at a magnetic pole .",
    "however the 2 breaks in the ionized skin of the bubble , and the lack of a closed neutral hi shell , are similar to features in computational simulations ( in the literature ) of superbubbles which are evolving into chimneys . in these simulations",
    "fragmentation can be caused when magnetohydrodynamic instabilities mix the magnetized shell with the ambient medium .",
    "the fraction of ionizing photons emitted by ocl 352 that are not absorbed by the w4 loop is more than sufficient to account for the continuum emission from g134.4 + 3.85 .",
    "the excess can escape both through the two breaks observed in the shell as well as through the thin , fully ionized upper portion of the shell .",
    "g134.4 + 3.85 is @xmath4165 pc wide and extends @xmath4240 pc above the mid - plane of the galaxy , reaching beyond 135 pc which is the one-@xmath19 height of the global gaussian  distribution .",
    "while this is not into the galactic halo , the photons from ocl 352 can contribute to the ionization of the reynolds layer of the galaxy and are likely the main source of ionization of the large  loop seen in the wham data .",

    "<S> new observations at high latitudes above the  region w4 show that the structure formerly identified as a chimney candidate , an opening to the galactic halo , is instead a superbubble in the process of fragmenting and possibly evolving into a chimney . </S>",
    "<S> data at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath0 ) above the w3/w4 star forming region at 1420 and 408 mhz stokes i ( total power ) and 1420 mhz stokes q and u ( linear polarization ) reveal an egg - shaped structure with morphological correlations between our data and the  data of dennison , topasna , & simonetti . </S>",
    "<S> polarized intensity images show depolarization extending from w4 up the walls of the superbubble , providing strong evidence that the radio continuum is generated by thermal emission coincident with the  emission regions . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the parts of the  region hitherto known as w4 and the newly revealed thermal emission are all ionized by the open cluster ocl 352 . assuming a distance of 2.35 kpc , the ovoid structure is  164 pc wide and extends  246 pc above the mid - plane of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the shell s emission decreases in total - intensity and polarized intensity in various locations , appearing to have a break at its top and another on one side . using a geometric analysis of the depolarization in the shell s walls </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate that a magnetic field line - of - sight component of 3 to 5 @xmath1 exists in the shell . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the connection between w4 and the galactic halo , considering whether sufficient radiation can escape from the fragmenting superbubble to ionize the kpc - scale  loop discovered by reynolds , sterling & haffner . </S>"
