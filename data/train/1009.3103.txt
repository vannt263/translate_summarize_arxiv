    "wheeler - feynman electrodynamics ( wf ) describes the classical , electromagnetic interaction of a number of @xmath0 charges by action - at - a - distance @xcite .",
    "in contrast to maxwell - lorentz electrodynamics the theory contains no fields and is free from ultraviolet divergences originating from ill - defined self - fields .",
    "electrodynamics without fields was considered as early as 1845 by gauss @xcite and continued to be of interest , e.g. @xcite . in particular , it led wheeler and feynman @xcite to a satisfactory description of radiation damping : accelerated charges are supposed to radiate and to loose energy thereby .",
    "how can this be accounted for in a theory without fields ? to answer this question wheeler and feynman introduced a so - called _ absorber condition _ which needs to be satisfied by the world - lines of all charges , and they argue that it is satisfied on thermodynamic scales . under the absorber condition",
    "it is straightforwardly seen that the motion of any selected charge is described effectively by the lorentz - dirac equation , an equation dirac derived @xcite to explain the phenomena of radiation damping ; see our short discussion in @xcite .",
    "the advantage in wheeler and feynman s derivation of the lorentz - dirac equation is that it bares no divergences in the defining equations which provoke unphysical , so - called _ run - away _ , solutions . at the same time wheeler and feynman s argument is able to explain the irreversible nature of radiation phenomena .",
    "these features make wf the most promising candidate for arriving at a mathematically well - defined theory of relativistic , classical electromagnetism .    however , mathematically wf is completely open .",
    "it is not an initial value problem for differential equations because the wf equations contain time - like advanced and retarded state - dependent arguments for which no theory of existence or uniqueness of solutions is available .",
    "apart from two exceptions discussed below , it is not even known whether in general there are solutions at all . in tensor notation , wf is defined by : @xmath1_{+}^{\\mu\\nu}(z_i(\\tau))+f[z_k]_{-}^{\\mu\\nu}(z_i(\\tau))\\right]\\dot z_{i,\\nu}(\\tau ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2^\\mu_{\\pm}(x ) & : = e_k\\frac{\\dot { z}_k^\\mu(\\tau_{k,\\pm}(x))}{(x- z_{k}(\\tau_{k,\\pm}(x)))_\\nu\\;\\dot { z}_k^\\nu(\\tau_{i,\\pm}(x))},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the world line parameters @xmath3 are implicitly defined through @xmath4 here , the world lines of the charges @xmath5 for @xmath6 are parametrized by proper time @xmath7 and take values in minkowski space @xmath8 equipped with the metric tensor @xmath9 .",
    "we use einstein s summation convention for greek indices , i.e. @xmath10 , and the notation @xmath11 for an @xmath12 in order to distinguish the time component @xmath13 from the spatial components @xmath14 .",
    "the overset dot denotes a differentiation with respect to the world - line parametrization @xmath15 . for simplicity",
    "each particle has the same inertial mass @xmath16 ( all presented results however hold for charges having different masses , too ) .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath17 denotes the charge of the @xmath18-th particle .",
    "if one were to insist on using field theoretic language then one may also say that equations ( [ eqn : cea wf ] ) describe the interaction between the charges via their advanced and retarded linard - wiechert fields @xmath19_{+},f[z_k]_{-}$ ] , @xmath20 .",
    "these fields are special solutions of the maxwell equations of classical electrodynamics corresponding to a prescribed world - line @xmath21 .",
    "the functional dependence on @xmath22 is emphasized by the square bracket notation @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "given an @xmath12 and a time - like world line @xmath22 , i.e. one fulfilling @xmath24 , the solutions @xmath25 , @xmath26 , are unique and given by the intersection of the forward and backward light - cone of space - time point @xmath27 and the world - line @xmath21 , respectively ; see figure [ fig : advance_delay ] .",
    "the acceleration on the left - hand side of the wf equations depends through ( [ eqn : time ret ] ) on time - like advanced as well as retarded data ( with respect to @xmath28 ) of all the other world lines ; see figure [ fig : wf ladder ] .",
    "the delay is unbounded , and by ( [ eqn : cea lienard wiechert fields ] ) the right - hand side of ( [ eqn : cea wf ] ) again depends on the acceleration .    it is noteworthy that in early 1900 the mathematician and philosopher a.n .",
    "whitehead developed a philosophical view on nature which rejects `` initial value problems '' as fundamental descriptions of nature @xcite .",
    "he developed his own gravitational theory and motivated synge s study of what is now referred to as synge equations @xcite , i.e. @xmath29_{-}^{\\mu\\nu}(z_i(\\tau))\\dot z_{i,\\nu}(\\tau).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the synge equations share many difficulties with the wf equations but , as we shall show , are simpler to handle because they only depend on time - like retarded arguments .",
    "we would like to remark that independent of whitehead s philosophy it seems to be the case that often fields are introduced to formulate a physical law , even though it may have a delay character , as initial value problem .",
    "maxwell - lorentz electrodynamics is a prime example .",
    "however , these very fields are then often the source of singularities of the theory , quantum or classical .",
    "whitehead s idea might therefore point towards a fruitful new reflection about the character of physical laws .",
    "the books @xcite provide a beautiful overview on the topic of delay differential equations .",
    "however , for the wf equations as well as similar types of delay differential equations with advanced and retarded arguments of unbounded delay there are almost no mathematical results available .",
    "the problem one usually deals with in the field of differential equations without delay is extension of local solutions to a maximal domain and avoiding critical points by introducing a notion of typicality of initial conditions . for wf",
    "the situation is dramatic . because of the unbounded delay",
    ", the notion of local solutions does not make sense , so that the issue is not local versus global existence and also not explosion or running into singular points of the vector field .",
    "the issue is simply : _ do solutions exist ? _ and _ what kind of data of the solutions is necessary and/or sufficient to characterize solutions uniquely ? _",
    "to put our work in perspective we call attention to the following literature : angelov studied existence of synge solutions in the case of two equal point - like charges and three dimensions @xcite . under the assumption of an extra condition on the minimal distance between the charges to prevent collisions",
    ", he proved existence of synge solutions on the positive time half - line .",
    "uniqueness is only known in a special case in one dimension for two equal charges initially having sufficiently large opposite velocities and sufficiently large space - like separation . under these conditions driver",
    "has shown @xcite that the synge solutions are uniquely characterized by initial positions and momenta . with regards to wf two types of special solutions",
    "are known to exist : first , the explicitly known schild solutions @xcite composed out of specially positioned charges revolving around each other on stable orbits , and second , the scattering solutions of two equal charges constrained on the straight line @xcite .",
    "the latter result rests on the fact that the asymptotic behavior of world - lines on the straight line is well controllable ( due to this special geometry the acceleration dependent term on the right - hand side of ( [ eqn : cea wf ] ) vanishes ) .",
    "uniqueness of wf solutions was proven in one dimension with zero initial velocity and sufficiently large separation of two equal charges @xcite . in a recent work @xcite a well - defined analogue of the formal fokker variational principle for two charges restricted to finite intervals was proposed .",
    "it is shown that its minima , if they exist , fulfill the wf equations on these finite times intervals .",
    "furthermore , there are conjectures about uniqueness of wf solutions e.g. @xcite . while driver s result @xcite points to the possibility of uniqueness by initial positions and momenta , bauer s @xcite work suggests to specify asymptotic positions and momenta .",
    "furthermore , a wf toy model for two charges in three dimensions was given in @xcite for which a sufficient condition for a unique characterization of all its ( sufficiently regular ) solutions is the prescription of strips of time - like world lines long enough such that at least for one point on each strip the right - hand side of the wf equation is well - defined and the wf equation is fulfilled .",
    "our focus is on the bare existence of solutions of wf , i.e. on the question : _ do solutions exist ? _ for that question the issue that in a dynamical evolution of a system of point - like charges catastrophic events may happen is secondary ( compare the famous @xmath30-body problem of classical gravitation @xcite ) .",
    "more on target , such considerations would have to invoke a notion of typicality of trajectories , so that catastrophic events can be shown to be atypical .",
    "but that would require not only existence of solutions but also a classification of solutions .",
    "we are far from that .",
    "to avoid such issues at this early state of research we regard @xmath31 as introduced in @xcite instead of wf , i.e. we consider extended rigid charges described by the charge distributions @xmath32 , @xmath6 , where singularities do not even occur when charges pass through each other .    for our mathematical analysis",
    "it is convenient to express @xmath31 in coordinates where it takes the form @xmath33({{\\mathbf{x}}})+{{\\mathbf{v}}}({{\\mathbf{q}}}_{i , t})\\wedge{{\\mathbf{b}}}_t[{{\\mathbf{q}}}_k,{{\\mathbf{p}}}_k]({{\\mathbf{x}}})\\right )    \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath6 and @xmath34({{\\mathbf{x}}})\\\\      { { \\mathbf{b}}}_t^{(e_{+},e_{-})}[{{\\mathbf{q}}}_i,{{\\mathbf{p}}}_i]({{\\mathbf{x } } } )    \\end{pmatrix}=\\sum_\\pm 4\\pi e_\\pm \\int ds{{\\int d^3y\\ ; } } k_{t - s}^\\pm({{\\mathbf{x}}}-{{\\mathbf{y}}})\\begin{pmatrix }      -\\nabla\\varrho_i({{\\mathbf{y}}}-{{\\mathbf{q}}}_{i , s})-\\partial_s\\left[{{\\mathbf{v}}}({{\\mathbf{p}}}_{i , s})\\varrho_i({{\\mathbf{y}}}-{{\\mathbf{q}}}_{i , s})\\right]\\\\      \\nabla\\wedge\\left[{{\\mathbf{v}}}({{\\mathbf{p}}}_{i , s})\\varrho_i({{\\mathbf{y}}}-{{\\mathbf{q}}}_{i , s})\\right ]    \\end{pmatrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where as in ( [ eqn : wf equation written out ] ) most of the time we drop the superscript @xmath35 .",
    "here , @xmath36 are the advanced and retarded green s functions of the dalembert operator .",
    "the partial derivative with respect to time @xmath37 is denoted by @xmath38 , the gradient by @xmath39 , the divergence by @xmath40 , and the curl by @xmath41 . at time @xmath37 the @xmath18th charge for @xmath6 is situated at position @xmath42 in space @xmath43 , has momentum @xmath44 and carries the classical mass @xmath45 .",
    "the geometry of the rigid charges are described by the smooth charge densities @xmath32 of compact support , i.e. @xmath46 , for @xmath6 .    using the notation @xmath47 and @xmath48 and replacing @xmath32 by the three dimensional dirac delta distribution @xmath49 times @xmath50 one retrieves from ( [ eqn : wf equation written out ] ) the wf equations ( [ eqn : cea wf ] ) for @xmath51 and the synge equations ( [ eqn : synge ] ) for @xmath52 . as discussed in theorem [ thm : lwfields ]",
    ", the expression ( [ eqn : wf fields def ] ) for the choices for @xmath53 and @xmath52 is the advanced and retarded linard - wiechert field , respectively .",
    "the square brackets @xmath54 $ ] emphasize that these fields are functionals of the charge trajectory @xmath55 and no dynamical degrees of freedom in their own .",
    "+ the first idea to come to grips with existence of solutions is to adapt fixed point arguments from ordinary differential equations . that is not practical because of two difficulties .",
    "the first difficulty is that in general in wf one can not separate the second order derivative from lower order derivatives ; see ( [ eqn : lw_fields ] ) , ( [ eqn : lw_e_integrand ] ) and ( [ eqn : lw_b_integrand ] ) for a more explicit expression of ( [ eqn : wf fields def ] ) . therefore one can not rewrite the wf equations in terms of an integral equation which is normally employed in the fixed points arguments .",
    "the second difficulty is that the time - like advanced and retarded arguments introduced by ( [ eqn : wf fields def ] ) are of unbounded delay so that wf dynamics makes only sense for charge trajectories which are globally defined in time .",
    "one would thus have to find an appropriately normed space of functions on @xmath56 on which the fixed point map can be defined  which has not been found yet .",
    "one may circumvent this problem by introducing a notion of conditional solution where outside a chosen time interval @xmath57 $ ] the trajectories are prescribed by hand . the fixed point argument -",
    "if that could be formulated - would then run on the time interval @xmath57 $ ] only .",
    "if successful , one may then try to construct a bonafide global solution by letting @xmath58 . in this work",
    "we show how one can formulate a fixed point procedure on intervals @xmath57 $ ] for arbitrary large @xmath59 , i.e. we show how one can circumvent the first difficulty albeit gaining conditionally solutions only .",
    "the extension to global solutions would require good control on the asymptotic behavior ( as e.g. in @xcite in the case of the motion on the straight line ) , which we do not pursue here .",
    "we stress , however , that the extension to infinite time intervals is an interesting and worthwhile task , joining the results of this paper with the removal technique for @xmath60 introduced in @xcite .    the key idea",
    "to define a fixed point map on time intervals @xmath57 $ ] is a reformulation of the wf functional differential equations into a system of non - linear partial differential equations without delay , namely the maxwell - lorentz equations without self - interaction ( abbrev .",
