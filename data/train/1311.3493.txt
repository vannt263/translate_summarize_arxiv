    "scalar bosons with local interactions in one dimension are generically described by the paradigm of luttinger liquids ( ll ) , which amounts to quantized superfluid hydrodynamics augmented with instantons ( aka  backscattering events \" in the fermionic language ) responsible for quantum slippages of the superfluid phase .",
    "it is via the instantons that superfluid hydrodynamics is coupled to either a commensurate external potential , or disorder , or both ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) . the ll picture is typically preserved under the correlation length of the superfluid - to - insulator quantum phase transition , providing a natural framework for an asymptotically exact description of criticality .",
    "arguably , the most intriguing superfluid - to - insulator quantum phase transition is the one that is induced by disorder and leads to the formation of the bose glass ( bg ) , a compressible insulator.@xcite in their seminal paper on localization in one - dimensional ( 1d ) superfluids,@xcite giamarchi and schulz found  by means of a perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) analysis  that the transition to the bg is of the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type and is characterized by the universal value @xmath6 of the luttinger parameter @xmath0 .",

    "however , of importance to us is the flow and the physics at _ mesoscopic _ scales .",

    "a controlled description of the weak - link quantum criticality is achieved by combining the rg treatment of ref .   with the kane - fisher renormalization of the link strength at a given length scale .",
    "the applicability of hydrodynamics below the correlation radius is guaranteed by the theorem of critical self - averaging proven in ref .   and stating that the superfluid stiffness is well defined for the critical flow as long as it does not vanish in the thermodynamic limit . if governed by single weak links , the flow of superfluid stiffness @xmath18 has to obey the equation @xmath76^{-1}$ ] ( see ref .  ) .",

    "we presented an asymptotically exact theory for the sf - bg transition in the presence of appropriately strong disorder by combining the classical field flow of ref .   with the kane - fisher renormalization , originally derived for single weak links.@xcite this constitutes the crucial difference with the real - space rg treatment introduced by altman and coworkers , as the latter is unable to address the kane - fisher renormalization  since it does not treat properly the phonon degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "the hallmark of our theory is the relation @xmath158 stating that there are no superfluids with a luttinger parameter smaller than @xmath124 ; all future work has to deal with this microscopic quantity .",
    "we have checked that the available data from refs .   are compatible with the present scenario ( and , in particular , with a kosterlitz - thouless - type transition at a non - universal value of @xmath159 ) , but the data are insufficient for studying the transition accurately and/or extracting @xmath2 .",
    "our treatment applies to both bose and mott glasses . in the latter case ,",
    "the system remains compressible at criticality even though it is incompressible on the insulating side ( the renormalization of @xmath17 starts when @xmath0 drops to values close to @xmath160 ) .",
    "the semi - rg equations that we derived here can straightforwardly be upgraded to a system of three equations describing both the strong - disorder and giamarchi - schultz ( or mott - glass ) criticalities , as well as the competition between the two .",
    "this is achieved by accounting for the standard ( for kt theory ) instanton  anti - instanton renormalization terms in the flows of @xmath18 ( and @xmath17 , if necessary ) , and introducing the rg equation for the flow of concentration of the instanton  anti - instanton pairs ( for the details , see ref .  ) .",
    "furthermore , in the mott glass case ( where instantons have no phase factors ) , the ground - state 1d quantum system is directly mapped onto a 2d finite - temperature  scratched - disordered \" superfluid film .",
    "the film is supposed to have a peculiar disorder in the form of straight parallel scratches cutting through the film .",
    "if the disorder is strong enough to guarantee @xmath161 , the film experiences the superfluid - to - normal phase transition of the above - discussed strong - disorder universality class , happening at the critical temperature @xmath162 ( with @xmath163 the superfluid density and @xmath164 the mass of the atoms ) , thus preempting the usual berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition . despite a different transition scenario ,",
    "the state at @xmath165 is just a normal film .",
    "this is seen from the fact that the vortex pairs are _ dangerously _ irrelevant with respect to the scratches : when @xmath163 is suppressed to zero at @xmath165 , the vortex - antivortex pairs inevitably proliferate , rendering the final phase indistinguishable from the standard normal state .",
    "likewise , there are no two different bose glass phases because the rare weak links and the instanton  anti - instanton pairs are dangerously irrelevant with respect to each other .",
    "hence , while only one of the two is responsible for criticality , the other one also becomes important on the insulating side ( at distances at which the value of @xmath0 becomes appropriately small ) , removing the potential qualitative difference between the glasses .",
