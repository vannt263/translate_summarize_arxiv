    "the emergence of topological order is one of the most intriguing phenomena in interacting quantum systems.@xcite most importantly perhaps , emergent quasiparticles in two - dimensional topological phases of matter can acquire non - abelian statistics and may provide quantum states with highly nonlocal entanglement that form an ideal basis for quantum information processing.@xcite many unanswered questions about topological systems remain , despite recent developments in the field exploring phase transitions ( notably those driven by topological bose condensation)@xcite , stability of topological phases to perturbations,@xcite coupling of multiple non - abelian subsystems,@xcite or creation of non - abelian theories from coupling simpler subsystems.@xcite it is in these general realms that the current paper seeks to explore .    in most cases we are not able to easily relate the complex topological physics to more traditional condensed matter systems .",
    "however , one important exception is that topological systems of ising type ( meaning they are described by a topological field theory related to the ising conformal field theory ( cft ) or the su(2)@xmath2 chern - simons theory ) can be frequently related to superconductors , thus providing a particularly powerful handle for understanding them .",
    "such systems are now of particular interest due to a variety of recent experiments aimed at realizing them in the laboratory.@xcite in the current work we will examine a variant of the moore - read@xcite quantum hall state , which is of this superconducting type.@xcite    another approach that has been extremely important in developing an understanding of topological phases is the use of exactly solvable models.@xcite even when exactly solvable models are very far from any real experimental system , their solutions teach us general principles , and we may hope that the physical systems will be described by the same phase of matter as the model , and will therefore have the same universal properties . further , with modern quantum technologies , such as cold atoms , trapped ions , or josephson junctions,@xcite one may hope that the precise model system may even be successfully realized in the future . in this spirit",
    ", we will deploy model hamiltonians that can be solved exactly as a central part of our current work .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the effect of inter - layer tunneling on a bilayer quantum hall system formed by two bosonic @xmath4 moore - read states , each one being the exact ground state of a three - body contact interaction . while we frame the discussion in terms of a quantum hall bilayer",
    ", similar considerations apply to any system with two internal degrees of freedom , including valley degrees or spin degrees of freedom . to a large extent",
    "the same physics will occur also for interacting particles in chern bands with chern number @xmath5 .",
    "since the moore - read state can be thought of as a ( chiral ) @xmath6-wave superconductor of composite fermions , for intuition , it is useful to think of the inter - layer tunneling as a process occurring between two superconductors .",
    "as is well known , tunneling of single particles is suppressed due to the superconducting gap , and one must consider then the tunneling of pairs , which gives rise to the rich phenomenology of the josephson effect.@xcite in the case of coupled moore - read states , however , it is crucial that the paired particles are _ composite fermions _  in this case , bosons bound to ( jastrow factor ) correlation holes . due to these correlation holes , it would be very difficult for bare bosons ( paired or otherwise ) to tunnel between the layers , as one must open a ( jastrow ) correlation hole in the new layer and remove the ( jastrow ) correlation hole from the old layer  essentially moving the flux between the layers along with the boson .    in order to create a setting for moore - read states in which tunneling is possible , we introduce an inter - layer correlation hole @xmath7 by adding a suitably strong two - body inter - layer contact repulsion ( @xmath8 of haldane pseudo potentials@xcite ) .",
    "in such a situation , a correlation hole always exists in the opposite layer , which can receive a tunneling particle easily .",
    "while one still expects single - particle tunneling to be suppressed due to the pairing physics of the moore - read state , in this situation one expects to realize pair tunneling similar to that of the conventional josephson effect .",
    "the exact ground state of our three - body intra - layer contact interaction along with the two - body inter - layer interaction is the coupled moore - read state , first discussed in ref .   in the resulting model ,",
    "all particles carry the same jastrow correlations .",
    "hence , by removing the overall flux attachment , the system yields a solvable model for two josephson coupled @xmath6-wave superconductors .    in the presence of pure three - body contact interactions plus inter - layer two - body repulsion ,",
    "the coupled moore - read states are degenerate with respect to moving pairs of bosons between layers .",
    "this symmetry gives rise to a goldstone mode in the spectrum . here , pair tunneling is crucial and even at infinitesimal magnitude it selects one particular ground state from the previously degenerate manifold of ground states and gaps the goldstone mode .",
    "if we denote the pseudospins of bosons in the two layers with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , then in the basis of symmetric and antisymmetric pseudospin states , @xmath11 , we find that the ground state wave function for small tunneling yields a particular superposition of coupled moore - read states that is exactly the halperin 220 state.@xcite this is a surprising result , for it immediately follows that we can write a purely two - body hamiltonian which reproduces the exact ground state of our three - body interaction .    beyond the ground state properties , we see that the quasihole spectrum of these hamiltonians can be calculated exactly and we demonstrate that it reflects the physics of confinement of quasiholes . to make this connection , we begin by calculating the full spectrum ( for any number of quasiholes ) of the system of uncoupled moore - read states , where the quasihole excitations can be viewed as vortices of the composite fermion superconductor .",
    "in addition , one needs to consider the possible fusion channels of the majorana zero modes in the vortex cores.@xcite the introduction of josephson tunneling between the layers can then be understood as locking the superconducting phase between the two layers , which results in binding ( confining ) vortices into pairs between the two layers , i.e.  each vortex is accompanied by a partner at the same location in the other layer . taking this restriction into account , we find the spectrum of the coupled moore - read layers : the bulk is described by a u(1)@xmath12u(1)@xmath2 cft , but the edge revels a different u(1)@xmath13u(1 ) structure at fixed particle number .",
    "we show how these theories relate to the ising@xmath14ising content of two uncoupled moore - read states , and demonstrate that the confinement of quasihole operators renders several types of topological excitations topologically invisible .",
    "the overall effect of the josephson coupling on the spectrum of topological bulk excitations is then the same as the effect that would be induced by topological bose condensation of these invisible particles .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : josephsoncoupling ] we introduce our specific model of josephson coupled moore - read states and discuss its qualitative physics and the nature of its ground state sector . in section [ sec : excitations ] , we analyze the finite size quasihole spectra of our model bilayer hamiltonians with josephson coupling and also deduce the edge spectrum for an infinite droplet . in section [ sec : cft ]",
    "we develop a description of this physics in terms of topological bose condensation transitions between the underlying conformal field theories .",
    "the final section [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to conclusions and a general outlook for generalizations of our approach .",
    "our aim is to study the effect of josephson coupling on a bilayer system composed of two moore - read states . throughout this work ,",
    "we focus on the case of bosons , although many of our results can be generalized to the case of fermions . within each layer",
    ", we can use three - body contact interactions as the parent hamiltonian of the moore - read state to induce the desired pairing properties . in order to create a ground state that is susceptible to tunneling",
    ", we additionally require a correlation hole between the layers .",
    "these correlations are created by an additional inter - layer repulsion in the hamiltonian , leading us to define the parent hamiltonian for coupled moore - read states , defined on the plane as [ eq : projectiveh ] _ 32 & = & _ 3 _ i < j < k = 1^n _ ^(2)(z^_i - z^_j)^(2 ) ( z^_j - z^_k ) + & + & _ 3_i < j < k = 1^n _ ^(2)(z^_i - z^_j)^(2 ) ( z^_j - z^_k ) + & + & _ 2 _ i=1^n _ _ j=1^n _ ^(2)(z^_i - z^_j ) . we choose the prefactors @xmath15 and @xmath16 such that term acts as a projector on lowest landau level states , and we use an equivalent construction in the spherical geometry for our numerics ( see appendix [ apx : sphere ] ) . the hamiltonian ( [ eq : projectiveh ] ) conserves the number of particles per layer , and its ground state wave function in a given sector with ( even ) number of particles @xmath17 and @xmath18 per layer is given  as per construction  by the coupled moore - read state that was introduced in ref .  , _ 0^n _ , n_(\\{z^_i},\\{z^_j } ) = pf()pf ( ) + _ i < j=1^n_(z^_i - z^_j)_i < j=1^n_(z^_i - z^_j)_i=1^n__j=1^n_(z^_i - z^_j ) .

    "we shall take polynomials in complex coordinates @xmath22 to either denote states on the plane ( omitting overall gaussian factors ) or on the sphere ( via stereographic projection ) , as explained further in appendix [ apx : sphere ] .",
    "each of the two coupled moore - read states can be thought of as a @xmath6-wave superconductor of composite fermions,@xcite and we can deploy the picture of a bose condensate of cooper pairs .",
    "an important consequence is the fact that an odd number of particles per layer can not be accommodated in the ground state . instead ,",
    "odd number configurations leave an unpaired fermion or ` broken pair ' which implies a finite gap @xmath23 for the resulting bogoliubov quasiparticle or neutral fermion excitation.@xcite hence , hamiltonian ( [ eq : projectiveh ] ) constrains the ground state to an even number of particles per layer .",
    "all sectors with an even number of bosons per layer possess an exact ( and unique ) zero energy ground state .",
    "it follows that ( cooper ) pairs can be moved between the layers at vanishing energetic cost and , if we think in terms of the larger hilbert space allowing such processes , the ground state degeneracy amounts to @xmath24 . henceforth , let us denote the ground state with @xmath25 particles in the upper layer and @xmath26 in the lower layer via the shorthand _",

    "there is a u(1 ) symmetry in the difference @xmath28 between these complex superconducting order parameters , and we expect that long wavelength fluctuations of @xmath29 give rise to a goldstone mode . indeed , our numerics confirm that the gap of low - lying excited states at small angular momentum scales as @xmath30 , indicating the presence of a linearly dispersing goldstone mode . due to the discrete number of available momenta in finite size systems",
    ", the goldstone excitations always occur at finite energy .",
    "hence , we will focus on the physics of the ground state and zero - energy excitations for the coupled moore - read state , and leave the full exploration of the superconducting coherence and the collective goldstone mode for a future publication .    to explore the effect of josephson coupling",

    "we extend our model directly by a pair tunneling term , and choose this to be local , i.e.\"we consider tunneling of pairs with relative angular momentum zero , given by the term [ eq : vumklapp ] v_0^ = d^2r _ 0^ ( , ) _ 0 ( , ) + h.c .",

    "partially motivated by these ( approximate ) physical realizations , and partially in order to show that the solvable point of the 220 state belongs to a a wider range of parameter space , hence representative of a stable phase of matter , we also consider a generalized hamiltonian where we allow for the magnitude of the tunneling term to be tuned by a variable prefactor @xmath73:@xcite [ eq : hameffalpha ] ^ ( ) = v_0^ + v_0^ + v_0^ + v_0^. we discuss the excitation spectrum of this hamiltonian in section [ sec : hameffalpha ] .",

    "is the following : the quasiholes of the moore - read state can be thought of as vortices of the underlying composite fermion superconductor , i.e. , the superconducting phase winds by @xmath79 when going around one of these quasiparticles . in the absence of tunneling , we are free to place vortices independently in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 layers . however , when @xmath80 we induce an energetic confinement of the @xmath9-vortices at @xmath81 to @xmath10-vortices at @xmath82 , because an isolated vortex would create a mismatch of the superconducting phases between the two layers .",
    "indeed , our analysis of the quasiparticle states confirms that the exact zero energy quasihole states of @xmath75 are obtained from the quasihole spectrum of @xmath77 by identifying the quasihole positions @xmath83 ( see appendix  [ apx : exact ] for an explicit example ) .",
    "the formation of quasiparticle excitations is a hallmark of topological order in incompressible fractional quantum hall liquids .",

    "we have not been able to find a cft that describes both the ground state and the excitation spectrum of this hamiltonian , and conjecture that such cft does not exist .",

    "more specifically , the zero energy eigenstates of this hamiltonian can be obtained from those of a system with independent moore - read layers by simply multiplying by an inter - layer jastrow factor , which reflects the inter - layer interaction .",
    "this hamiltonian has a goldstone mode reflecting the symmetry that one can move particles freely between layers two at a time and remain in the zero energy subspace .",
    "so long there is no tunneling between the layers , this symmetry remains valid and the corresponding goldstone mode is present .",
    "the second model hamiltonian @xmath121 consists of purely two - body terms , including both interactions and inter - layer tunneling .",

    "the result is a new ( and now a proper ) topological phase of matter , represented by the hamiltonian @xmath123 with nonzero tunneling parameter @xmath42 .",
    "the system with tunneling has the same ( abelian ) topological order as @xmath121 .",
    "in fact , we found that the ground state of @xmath123 becomes identical to the ground state of @xmath121 in the limit of small but nonzero tunneling .",

    ", we see that this confinement of quasiholes rules out several sectors of the full su(2)@xmath2 @xmath14 su(2)@xmath2 theory ( the ones with unpaired elementary quasiholes ) , which implies that yet more sectors become topologically indistinguishable or invisible - that is , they can not be distinguished by their braiding properties from any of the remaining , non - confined particles .",
    "the introduction of tunneling thus gives a reduction in topological order which is the same as that which would result from topological bose condensation of the topologically invisible particles ",

    "instead , an interesting twist occurs in the edge spectrum of the coupled moore - read state , which takes the surprising form of u(1)@xmath3 u(1 ) at fixed @xmath41 .",
    "we attribute this behavior to the fact that in the rotated ( symmetric / antisymmetric ) basis , the charged and neutral sectors of the 220 state are separated . with the charge quantum number being conserved but without any such conservation restriction on the neutral  charge \" ,",
    "we show that the edge spectrum must take the observed form .",
    "while much of our analysis here has focused on the properties of quasiholes , we note that it is in principle straightforward to construct trial wave functions for quasiparticle states and even for states with quasiholes and quasiparticles .",
    "on the one hand , the @xmath67 state has natural composite fermion excitations . on the other hand ,",
    "quasiparticle states for @xmath77 can be constructed from the successful trial wave functions for a single layer pfaffian considered in refs .  .",
    "one would expect to find a similar connection between the quasiparticle spectra as for the quasihole spectra , although numerical evidence will be harder to gather , because the quasiparticle states will not be zero energy states of any of the model hamiltonians .",
    "the physics of a gapless goldstone mode being gapped by inter - layer tunneling is quite reminiscent of the well - studied physics of the 111 state.@xcite analogous to that case , in the absence of tunneling there is an exact degeneracy associated with moving particles between layers ( in the 111 case , particles can be moved between layers one at a time , whereas here they must be moved in pairs ) .",
    "this degeneracy can also be understood in a different language where this state can be parametrized in terms of the components of a ( pseudo)-spinor , where the direction of the spinor represents the amplitude of the particles in the two layers . allowing the spinor direction to vary as a function of position , one obtains low energy goldstone mode excitations ( spin waves ) of the pseudospin ferromagnet.@xcite analogous to the case of the 111 state , introduction of a tunneling term between the layer breaks the symmetry , fixes the direction of the pseudospin and gaps the goldstone mode . in both this case and in the 111 state , the low energy excitations of the system are spin configurations known as merons , which correspond to introducing a quasiparticle vortex in only one of the two spin species .",
    "therefore , independent majorana - like excitations can form in each layer independently although they are bound together , or confined , at longer distances .",
    "the connection to the physics of the 111 state will be explored in more detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "in addition to the connection to 111 physics , and its associated exciton physics , there are several other connections that would be interesting to explore .",
    "one possibility is to consider coupled @xmath125 read - rezayi wave functions , with tunneling of @xmath91 particles between layers at a time .",
    "much of the same confinement physics will remain , although some non - abelian particles may remain deconfined .",
    "another example to explore would be the tunnel coupling of more than two layers together . these are also issues that we will defer until a later time .",

    "[ eq : phi ] . read and rezayi show that the relevant polynomials have a degree of at most @xmath233 , i.e.  the number of unbroken pairs .",
    "hence , this contribution can be thought of as the degeneracy associated with placing @xmath223 bosons in a landau level with @xmath233 flux quanta , which yields the orbital degeneracy of , [ eq : dorb ] d_(n , n , p ) = , and the total degeneracy of quasihole states of the moore - read state for fixed @xmath41 and @xmath91 becomes , d_(n , n ) = _ ^n d_(n , n , p ) d_(n , p ) .     here",
    ", we are also interested in the degeneracy of quasihole states as a function of angular momentum . in order to obtain this dependence",
    ", we can use read and rezayi s analogy of unpaired fermions and bosons filling the respective numbers of orbitals as discussed above . in order to obtain the angular momentum decomposition of each of these terms individually",
    ", we can use euler s generating function ( n_,q , x ) = _ m=1^n _ , [ eq : partitionfinite ] to be taken as an infinite series in the abstract variable @xmath219 , and we have introduced an additional parameter @xmath234 .",
    "the degree @xmath36 of individual powers of @xmath219 encodes the angular momentum of a corresponding landau level orbital @xmath235 .",
    "the parameter @xmath234 allows us to distinguish between terms stemming from unoccupied orbitals with trivial factors @xmath236 and occupied orbitals that are proportional to @xmath234 . for @xmath237 ,",
    "the ensuing series provides the character of a chiral boson field , and powers in @xmath234 provide additional information on the number of occupied orbitals in the individual terms at fixed angular momentum .",
    "this allows us to read off the finite size counting of the number of states with angular momentum @xmath238 for @xmath191 bosons in @xmath239 orbitals by taking certain derivatives , [ eq : dbose ] d_(k , n_,l ) = |_x , q0   the analogous counting for fermions follows from mapping the problem of @xmath191 fermions in @xmath239 orbitals onto the corresponding bose problem where @xmath240 orbitals are removed due to pauli blocking , and hence , [ eq : dfermi ] d_(k , n_,l ) = d_(k , n_-k+1,l ) .    using read - rezayi s insights",
    ", we obtain the count of quasihole states at a given angular momentum @xmath92 by following the rules of angular momentum addition and convoluting the bose and fermi countings . for the moore - read pfaffian state , with @xmath41 electrons and @xmath91 additional flux quanta , the @xmath92 dependent degeneracies become , [ eq : dmr ] d_(n , n ,",
    "l_z ) = _ ^n _ l = 0^l_z   + d_(2n , , l ) d_(p , n-1,l_z - l).finally , the degeneracies of state per @xmath92 sector can be translated into the count of multiplets in the total angular momentum @xmath241 , as given in the original paper by read and rezayi .",
    "because eigenstates of rotationally invariant hamiltonians always occur in @xmath242-fold degenerate angular momentum multiplets @xmath243 , with @xmath244 , the number of multiplets @xmath245 at a given total angular momentum @xmath241 is given by @xmath246 in tables [ tab : degmrxmr ] and [ tab : degeffectiveh ] , we denote the structure of the zero - energy hilbert subspaces @xmath95 via their multiplet structure using the notation [ eq : low_energy_hilbert ] = _ l=0^l _ l^(l ) .",
    "going beyond the counting of quasihole states in finite size systems , the large angular momentum part of the count of quasihole states maps onto the counting of edge states of the system , which is _",
    "universal_.@xcite formally , the counting of edge modes can be deduced from @xmath247 in the limit of a ` large correlation hole ' with both @xmath248 and @xmath249 ( while maintaining @xmath250).@xcite in this picture , the largest angular momentum @xmath251 of the quasihole states on a sphere maps to the edge state of a disc with momentum @xmath252 , while general states obey @xmath253 .",
    "we use this correspondence in this paper to compare finite size data to the edge state counting in the infinite system , which is conveniently described by the characters of conformal field theories.@xcite    for the moore - read state , the edge of the infinite size droplet is described by a product of the majorana - weyl character @xmath254 and the character of a chiral boson @xmath110.@xcite the edge spectrum carries information about the parity of the fermion number and hence differs in sectors of even / odd number of particles , with the respective majorana - weyl characters , [ eq : mwchi ] ^_= .   defining the character of the chiral boson as , ^=_n _ ( n_,q,1 ) , [ eq : chiralbosonchi ] the character for the moore - read edge becomes , [ eq : singlemrcharacter ] ^(n ) = ^ ^_(-1)^n , where only the parity of the number of particles in the droplet affects the result .      f.a .",
