    ". wishart ensemble may be also the first random matrix application in science .",
    "if we consider multivariate time series represented by a matrix @xmath6 , where space indices run @xmath7 , and time indices run @xmath8 , the empirical correlation matrix can be represented as @xmath9 or , in a matrix notation , @xmath10 , where bar ( @xmath11 , respectively ) applies to the more general case of the data valued in complex numbers .",
    "lowercase @xmath12 denotes the standardized time series , i.e. after a procedure when for each individual time series we subtract the corresponding mean and divide the result be the corresponding variance .",
    "wishart ensemble corresponds to a maximally random correlation matrix , where each entry @xmath13 of a rectangular signal matrix is drawn from a real ( complex ) gaussian distribution , so @xmath14 , where angle brackets represent taking the expectation values with respects to the probabilistic measure ( here gaussian ) . in general ,",
    "the time series may include correlations .",
    "in particular , assuming space and time factorization , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are symmetric ( hermitian ) positive definite matrices . the spectral properties of such single - correlated ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) @xcite or doubly - correlated ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) @xcite wishart ensembles were extensively studied in the literature .",
    "when the number of consecutive measurements ( the length of the series ) tends to infinity the empirical correlation matrix tends to the true correlation matrix .",
    "unfortunately , there are systems in which one can not repeat measurements due to uniqueness of data ( e.g. study of climate ) or the fact that the number of independent time series is of the same order as the number of measurements ( e.g. stock markets ) . in such instances",
    "the empirical correlation matrix deviates from the true correlation matrix .",
    "the wishart matrix corresponding to such situation can be obtained in a limiting procedure @xmath22 with @xmath23 fixed .",
    "this limit is referred to as random matrix theory ( rmt ) limit or big data limit  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 , pertaining to the rectangularity of the array of collected data , is also known as the signal - to - noise ratio . even having the ability to collect a vast number of data points",
    ", one would like to extract the leading portion of information from the system .",
    "such a procedure relies on the diagonalization of the correlation matrix and focusing on the largest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors and bears the name of principal component analysis ( pca ) .",

    "the analysis of correlation matrices presented above gives an insight into the interdependence of the components of complex systems _ at _ the same moments . in order to gain the access to the correlations at different instants",
    ", one has to shift the time index when correlating the time series , obtaining the auto cross - correlation matrix @xmath25 , which explicitly depends on the time lag @xmath26 .",
    "such object appeared in the literature also under the name of delayed or time - lagged correlation matrix . for simplicity",

    "the analysis of time - lagged correlations is recently becoming an area of a rapid development  @xcite .",
    "the diagonalization of the asymmetric lagged correlation matrices in the financial context was proposed in @xcite and in studies of human brain activity in @xcite .",

    "studied  @xcite the singular values of the lagged correlation matrices in various complex systems , including eeg signal and stock market , finding the long - range magnitude correlations .    because of the asymmetry of the lagged correlation matrix , its spectrum is complex , which invalidates the standard tools of random matrix theories .",
    "finding the rmt benchmark of the spectrum , corresponding to the absence of any correlations within the system is a formidable challenge . due to the importance of the lagged correlations",
    ", this spectral problem was attacked few times in the literature , using the tools of rmt : + ( i ) _ symmetrization . _",
    "first , the symmetrized lagged covariance matrix @xmath28 was studied  @xcite . in the big data limit ( @xmath29 with @xmath30 fixed ) the resulting real spectral density comes from the resolvent ( green s function ) fulfilling a quartic algebraic equation ( ferrari equation ) .",

    "we call this method abelization , as it refers to the abel transform and works only for matrices that commute with their hermitian conjugate .",
    "+ ( iv ) finally , the explicit non - hermitian lagged correlation matrices were analized by jarosz  @xcite using the non - hermitian diagrammatic techniques . in particular , the result ( iii ) was challenged - the radial spectral function was originating from the cubic algebraic equation ( cardano type ) .",
    "+ ( v ) later on , livan and rebecchi  @xcite proposed another approach relying on the assumption that the benchmark for the lagged correlation matrix can be approximated by a product of two independent rectangular gaussian matrices , the spectral density of which was calculated in  @xcite and is given by the solution of a quadratic equation .    in this paper , we first summarize the above approaches using the powerful version of random matrix theory in the large size limit , called free random variables .",
    "this technique represents a remarkable short - cut for calculations of various correlation matrices , in the limit when the number of measured components @xmath5 and the number of measurements @xmath32 are large , but their ratio @xmath23 is finite  @xcite .",

    ", we recall a certain linearization method for study the non - hermitian random matrix ensembles .",
    "we present the diagrammatic construction in the asymptotic limit . to find the spectrum of the lagged correlation matrix",

    "in the classical probability theory , the problem of finding the probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath37 of a sum @xmath38 of two independent random variables @xmath12 and @xmath39 resulting from the corresponding measures @xmath40 and @xmath41 is solved with the help of the characteristic function .",
    "the characteristic function , which is in fact the fourier transform of the pdf , factorizes the convolution problem @xmath42 into a product of the individual characteristic functions for both pdfs . since the characteristic function is the generating function for the moments of @xmath43 , the calculation of moments of the sum boils down to combinatorics .",
    "further simplification comes from considering the logarithm of the characteristic function - the multiplication of the characteristic functions is then replaced by the addition of their logarithms .",
    "this sum rule holds for each term in the series expansion , so the corresponding coefficients , called cumulants , are additive under convolution .",
    "similarly , the mellin transform reduces the problem of finding probability distribution for the product @xmath44 of the aforementioned variables to the simple multiplication of the corresponding problems  @xcite .",
    "free random variable ( frv ) calculus provides tools , which superimpose the above addition and multiplication laws in the case , when variables @xmath12 and @xmath39 are replaced by asymptotically infinite , non - commuting matrices @xmath34 and @xmath45 .",
    "one asks what the spectral measure of @xmath46 and @xmath47 is , provided that the individual spectral measures for both @xmath34 and @xmath45 are known .",
    "as such , frv represents a certain non - commutative counterpart of a classical probability calculus , ideally suited for the multivariate analysis of large matrices .",
    "the main objects in frv are defined as follows .",
    "we are interested in finding the distribution of the _ real _ eigenvalues @xmath48 of some stochastic matrix @xmath49 in the limit when @xmath5 ( size of the matrix ) tends to infinity .",

    "the wigner distribution is therefore the frv counterpart of the gaussian distribution in the classical probability theory .",
    "the crucial notion in free probability is the freeness condition which replaces independence in the classical probability calculus .",
    "the most intuitive definition of freeness of @xmath16 and @xmath17 is based on the complete decorrelation of the corresponding eigenvectors , i.e. their eigenbases are maximally random oriented .",
    "the pair @xmath16 and @xmath60 becomes free in the limit when the size of matrices tends to infinity , provided that @xmath61 is haar unitary ( i.e. infinitely large random unitary matrix from circular unitary ensemble ) . for a free pair @xmath62 a powerful addition law holds r_*a*+*b*(z)=r_*a*(z)+r_*b*(z ) , [ hermadd ] linearizing the spectral problem of convolution of two non - commuting free random ensembles .",
    "since the r - transforms are the generating functions for the free cumulants , the above law imposes the additivity of free cumulants , in an analogy to the addition law for the logarithms of the characteristic functions in the classical probability theory .",
    "it is suitable here to demonstrate the difference between the classical and frv calculus on the simple example of convolution of two distributions , each of them composed of a binary set of -1/2 and 1/2 . in the classical case ,",
    "the resulting distribution is discrete , where the values -1 and 1 are obtained with the probability 1/4 each , and the value 0 is obtained with the probability 1/2 .",
    "the matrix - valued version of this example could be realized in terms of two identical large matrices @xmath16 and @xmath17 , each of them having on the diagonal the equal number of -1/2 and 1/2 .",
    "the spectral density functions are therefore given by _ *",
