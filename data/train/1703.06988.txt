    "it was january 15 , 2010 , when a group of nine twitter accounts , all created within an interval of 15 minutes , with names such as `` coakleyagainstu '' , `` coakleycatholic '' , etc .",
    "these were accounts with names starting with the name of the democratic candidate martha coakley who was running in the special election for the massachusetts u.s . senate seat .",
    "the newly minted accounts sent 929 tweets addressed to 573 unique users in the course of 138 minutes .",
    "all the tweets contained a url to the same website http://coakleysaidit.com , ( also registered on january 15 , 2010 ) , that showed video and audio from a speech by martha coakley , taken out of context , to advance the false claim that she is against the employment of catholics in the emergency room .",
    "-8pt    the nine accounts were sending a tweet per minute and repeating more or less the same content  reasons to be flagged as a spamming account .",
    "twitter discovered the automated tweets and consequently suspended all nine accounts .",
    "their existence and their misinformation attack would have gone unnoticed had it not been for one fortunate circumstance : we were collecting all tweets containing the names `` coakley '' and  brown , \" for martha coakley and scott brown respectively who were the two candidates for the senate election , in real - time during the week leading to the election .",
    "but , the tweets sent by these anonymous accounts were not simple tweets , they were so - called `` reply tweets '' , tweets directed to particular users .",
    "because a new account on twitter does nt have any followers .",
    "tweets sent by such an account will not be read by anyone .",
    "thus , addressing the tweets to a particular user makes it likely that the tweet will be read .",
    "but to what user do you send the tweet , out of the millions that are on twitter ?",
    "this is when a common spamming technique on twitter comes in handy : reply to users who used certain desired keywords in their tweets , that is , to users already attuned to the topic .",
    "our analysis of the recipients of these `` reply tweets '' revealed that 96% of them had been tweeting about the ma senate race in the four - hour interval between the time the anonymous accounts were created and when they started to send the `` reply tweets '' .",
    "almost 25% of the users who received a tweet ( 143 out of 573 ) retweeted the message .",
    "a screenshot from one of the retweets is shown in figure  [ fig : carney ] .",
    "we chose to show this tweet , because the user is a well known journalist and experienced user who joined twitter on march 2007 .",
    "his surprise at the message indicates the novelty of this technique at the time .",
    "the retweets had the effect that the followers of the retweeters were likely exposed to the misinformation , which they would have not seen otherwise .",
    "this is because the messages did nt include hashtags , a common way to group together tweets about a topic .",
    "our estimation of the audience size , based on the followers of the retweeters , amounted to 61,732 twitter users .",
    "all the facts presented in the previous subsection were part of @xcite .",
    "what we did nt do in that paper was to summarize our findings in an easily memorable recipe , which contains the steps used by the propagandists in spreading their misinformation on twitter .",
    "we re providing this recipe for the first time in this paper .    .a",
    "recipe for spreading misinformation on twitter via a `` twitter - bomb '' .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     this similarity should not be surprising .",
    "once a spamming technique has been proven successful , it is easily replicated , since the knowledge about its working is also shared on the internet .",
    "what should surprise and worry us is the fact that researchers and web platform developers may also know about such techniques , but they do little to warn and educate the public of the consequences .",
    "it is also unfortunate that tech companies who have been used to facilitate this practice , do not act pro - actively or effectively in stopping it . as an example of ineffective action we refer to the way facebook handled the accusation that its news verification was not balanced .",
    "we discuss it in a next section .",
    "we should not give the reader the impression that online propaganda started with twitter - bombs or facebook fake news .",
    "in fact , it is much older than social media , it is as old as the web itself .",
    "however , before the development of search engines it was not easy _ for propaganda to discover you_. search engines made it easy for propagandists to spread their message using techniques we now call _ web spam _ @xcite .",
    "advertisers , political activists and religious zealots of all kinds have been busy modifying the structure of the web in an effort to promote their own biased results over the organic , unbiased results .",
    "the search engine optimization ( seo ) industry has grown out of this effort , sometimes using unethical techniques to promote their message , and search engines have been continuously evolving to fend off these attacks .    in much of the first decade of the new millennium , search engines tried to defend against web spam , but the spammers were successful in circumventing their defenses by using first `` link farms '' and later `` mutual admiration societies '' , collections of web sites that would intentionally link to each other in order to increase everyone s pagerank @xcite . even when google was reportedly using up to 200 different signals to measure quality @xcite , professional seos would manage to get sites like jc penney s at the top of search results @xcite .",
    "google s ingenious solution to the problem of `` unfair competition for high placement on a page '' was the introduction of the advertising model of adwords and adsense that gave spammers an opportunity to make money while following rules .",
    "that seemed to work for a while .",
    "however , these financial incentives were so lucrative that they provided a reason for _ anyone _ to have a presence on the web , especially if that web presence managed to attract clicks and thus , ad dollars .",
    "this led to `` click bait '' and to the creation of ads masquerading as outrageous ( fake ) news stories , as we discussed in the previous section .    but",
    "as search engines and social media evolve , so do the propagandistic techniques .",
    "the rise of three recent methods of spamming in the wake of the u.s .",
    "presidential elections , `` fake news '' , `` featured snippets '' manipulation @xcite , and `` auto - completion revelations '' @xcite are the latest chapters in spreading propaganda through search engines and social media so that it will find you . as a community of researchers we need to embrace the challenge of documenting and understanding these phenomena as well as finding ways to make these issues known to the platforms providers .",
    "journalists and non - specialists also need to be informed , as they sometimes give credence to conspiracy theories , confusing the public @xcite .",
    "it is important for researchers , journalists and web users to continue to pay attention to the information and misinformation they encounter on the web , be it on google , twitter , or facebook . in this section ,",
    "we discuss how research results and their publicizing lead over time to changes in the design features of these systems , addressing the exhibited weaknesses .",
    "the central finding that gave the title to @xcite was the manipulation of google real - time search results through repetition of twitter posts by accounts ( real users or bots ) supporting a particular candidate . in december 2009",
    "( just one month before the ma special election for the u.s .",
    "senate seat in 2010 ) , google followed bing in introducing `` real - time search results '' , placing social media messages in one of the top positions search results for a relevant search query .",
    "these messages came mostly from twitter , which had an easy - to - use api to pull the tweets .",
    "tweets appearing in the search results were those that had been recently posted . that created the opportunity for political propagandists to exploit the search rankings creating a _ twitter - enabled google bomb_. as we documented in our paper , the manipulators were repeating the same messages , something also allowed by twitter , over and over to increase the volume of conversation about a particular topic and keep it fresh for search engines to include in their real - time results . repetition of a message would be annoying to the propagandist followers , but the target was not their followers feed ; it was google and bing , and through them , the public .",
    "we can see these highly - placed tweet messages from random twitter accounts in a screen shot for martha coakley s search results , taken in january 2010 ( figure  [ fig : coakley ] ) . during 2010",
    ", google eventually recognized that giving anonymous social media accounts a premium spot in its search results was not in line with its goals for reliable information and for a few years this feature disappeared .",
    "however , it has come back again , but in a different format : when searching for a person , it will pull up tweets from their timeline , as opposed to tweets about them , as exemplified in figure  [ fig : trumpgoogle ] . this is a great improvement , because it prevents actors who have an interest to promote their adversarial messages about an individual or product to receive an unearned spot at the top of the search results .      in @xcite",
    ", we included the following observation at the end of section 4 :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ our experiments with google real - time search have shown that , even though google does nt display tweets from users that have a spammer signature , it does display tweets from non - suspected users , even when these are retweets coming from spammers .",
    "thus , simply suspending spamming attacks is not sufficient .",
    "there should be some mechanism that allows for retroactively deleting retweets of spam and some mechanism that labels some twitter users as enablers of spam .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    at that time ( in 2010 ) , twitter did nt have an easy way to quote a tweet and it allowed users to edit the original tweet text when retweeting , as the tweet shown in figure  [ fig : carney ] indicated .",
    "that design feature turned out to be very problematic , among others for the reason mentioned in the quote above : deleted spam tweets lived in the retweets of other twitter users .",
    "however , it was also problematic because users often were purposefully changing the meaning of the text they were retweeting @xcite .",
    "most of this re - purposing was possible via third - party applications that were very popular in the early years of twitter .",
    "these applications were shut down over the years and nowadays twitter does nt allow the editing of a tweet that is being retweeted . additionally , if the original is deleted , the retweet is also deleted , while in a quoted retweet , the text `` this tweet is unavailable . ''",
    "will show in place of the deleted tweet .",
    "the proliferation of fake news on facebook achieved new levels once facebook made a big change in how its algorithm for the trending news feature worked . before august 2016 , when this change took effect ,",
    "the trending news feature was being curated by human editors , who filtered out unreliable sources and chose neutral or balanced sources for breaking news stories . however , when the online tech blog gizmodo posted an article in may 2016 @xcite , in which former employees of the trending news lamented anti - conservative bias , facebook reacted hastily and clumsily .",
    "worried about potential lawsuits for suppressing freedom of speech , it fired its team of human editors and replaced them with machine learning algorithms . given their prior research on rumor cascades on facebook @xcite one would expect that technical experts had a better understanding on the limitations of ai algorithms , but maybe they were not involved in the decision @xcite .",
    "it did nt take long after that change for fake news to start achieving trending news status , as buzzfeed reported on august 30 , 2016 @xcite . despite buzzfeed s relentless reporting on the fake news plague throughout the pre - election season ,",
    "the rest of the media and the public did nt tune in into this conversation until after the election .",
    "facebook initially disputed that it had a fake news problem , claiming that it accounts for only 1% of the news stories .",
    "however , the company changed course under the increased and sustained public pressure and introduced new features in its interface and the algorithms to address the issue @xcite",
    ".    one important feature that has rolled out recently is the labeling of news posts as `` disputed '' via fact - checking , third - party providers such as snopes or politifact .",
    "the screens hot in figure  [ fig : facebook - disputed ] is an example of this feature in action .",
    "in addition to adding this label , facebook warns users with an alert box before they try to share a disputed story , but they are still allowed to share @xcite .    it remains to be seen how this new feature will affect fake news spreading .",
    "again , access to facebook data that could allow independent researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions . without it ,",
    "our understanding of changes in human behavior correlated with or caused by changes in the socio - technical platforms they inhabit , will be limited .",
    "this is a reason of concern for our research communities .",
    "what is the moral of the story ? in the past , researchers were the ones discovering and documenting the misuse and abuse of socio - technical platforms by the hands of dubious actors with dubious agendas .",
    "@xcite is only one such example .",
    "however , our discovery was possible only because we were collecting data in real - time , after having noticed some evidence of foul play .",
    "when we think about twitter s approach to combating spammers , it seems reasonable that tweets created by misinformation - spreading accounts are automatically deleted and retracted from the entire network , once the accounts are suspended .",
    "however , the downside of such an approach is that it makes it impossible for researchers and fact - checkers to go back in time and study the origin of misinformation campaigns and the mechanism for spreading them .",
    "that is a severe limitation to research .",
    "the problem becomes even more pronounced in the content of fake news spreading on facebook .",
    "most facebook groups are private and if they are the source for starting certain cascades of fake news , outside researchers can not observe them in their early stages , missing crucial information that would lead to their understanding .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that in the current situation created by the fake news plague , researchers did nt play a leading role in their discovery .",
    "it were journalists and not researchers in academia or facebook and google who raised concerns , but were not heard .",
    "this is worrisome .",
    "facebook , by replacing humans with algorithms , has played a crucial role in fueling the fake news spreading phenomenon .",
    "similarly , the ease with which google enables earning ad money for page impression provided the financial incentives for the creation of the fake news industry .      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ in the context of the now omnipresent , web - based , socio - technical systems such as facebook , google , and twitter , what tasks should be performed by humans and what tasks by algorithms ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _                      p.  t. metaxas and e.  mustafaraj . from obscurity to prominence in minutes : political speech and real - time search . in _ proceedings of the websci10 : extending the frontiers of society on - line , http://bit.ly/2n1ieuc_ , april 2010 ."

    "<S> in 2010 , a paper entitled `` from obscurity to prominence in minutes : political speech and real - time search '' @xcite won the best paper prize of the web science 2010 conference . among its findings were the discovery and documentation of what was termed a `` twitter - bomb '' , an organized effort to spread misinformation about the democratic candidate martha coakley through anonymous twitter accounts . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> after summarizing the details of that event , we outline the recipe of how social networks are used to spread misinformation . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important steps in such a recipe is the `` infiltration '' of a community of users who are already engaged in conversations about a topic , to use them as organic spreaders of misinformation in their extended subnetworks . </S>",
    "<S> then , we take this misinformation spreading recipe and indicate how it was successfully used to spread fake news during the 2016 u.s . presidential election . </S>",
    "<S> the main differences between the scenarios are the use of facebook instead of twitter , and the respective motivations ( in 2010 : political influence ; in 2016 : financial benefit through online advertising ) . </S>",
    "<S> after situating these events in the broader context of exploiting the web , we seize this opportunity to address limitations of the reach of research findings and to start a conversation about how communities of researchers can increase their impact on real - world societal issues . </S>"
