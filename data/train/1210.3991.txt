    "one of the main problems in the field of primary cosmic - ray investigations is the form of the energy spectrum and the precise determination of the mass composition .",
    "precise information about the energy spectrum and mass composition of primary cosmic - rays at vhe ( @xmath1 10@xmath3 ev ) energies is an important input for understanding the origin of cosmic - rays and their propagation through the galaxy .",
    "cosmic - rays exhibit a nearly smooth power law energy spectrum over more than 10 decades of energy ( from @xmath4 10@xmath5 to 10@xmath6ev ) with significant kinks at @xmath4 10@xmath7 ev ( knee ) and @xmath4 10@xmath8ev ( ankle)[1,2 ] .",
    "the knee feature at @xmath4 10@xmath7ev , which involves a change in the differential spectral exponent from @xmath4 2.7 to @xmath4 3.1 has defied a clear explanation so far . among the possibilities , one of the reasons suggested for the knee feature involves a change in the composition of the primary cosmic - rays from a mainly proton dominated(@xmath4 90%  protons ) to a mixed ( protons + heavy nuclei ) composition or even heavy nuclei domination[2,3 ] .",
    "thus , it becomes very important to measure the cosmic - ray composition in the vhe range , especially at energies around 10@xmath9 - 10@xmath7ev .",
    "although primary cosmic - ray composition is known more or less precisely at energies up to @xmath4 10 tev from direct satellite / balloon based observations[4,5 ] , the low flux of primary cosmic - ray particles at energies @xmath1 10@xmath10 ev ( @xmath4 10@xmath11particles cm@xmath11 s@xmath13)does not allow direct measurement of primary composition with detectors carried on balloons and satellites .",
    "attempts have , therefore , been made to infer the cosmic - ray composition indirectly from data collected with large air shower arrays and atmospheric cerenkov telescopes which detect primary cosmic - rays indirectly by recording the secondary particles and photons produced in the atmospheric cascades initiated by these primaries[6,7,8,9 ] .",
    "these attempts have achieved limited success so far because of the difficulty in relating the observed cascade parameters to the primary mass . in the present communication",
    ", we make an attempt to show that one of the fractal / wavelet parameters derived from the cerenkov images recorded by an imaging cerenkov telescope ( like tactic ) exhibits an unprecedented efficiency for separating primary cosmic - rays in terms of their mass .",
    "this makes it possible to estimate the flux of cosmic - ray primaries at energies @xmath1 10@xmath10ev at large zenith angles with ground - based atmospheric cerenkov telescope systems .",
    "primary cosmic - rays ( protons , hadrons , photons etc . ) with energy @xmath14ev , initiate extensive air showers in the atmosphere , generating in the process a large number of secondary particles ( @xmath15 , hadrons , photons ) some of which survive absorption in the atmosphere and can be detected at ground level . a large number of @xmath16 , traveling with relativistic speeds , generate cerenkov photons in the atmosphere which arrive in the form of a few ns duration optical pulse ( @xmath17@xmath18 ) spread over a radius of @xmath4 100 m at ground level[6,7,10 ] .",
    "an imaging cerenkov telescope , comprising a large light collector with a matrix of photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) detectors in its focal plane , generates a two - dimensional picture of the resultant cerenkov photon distribution ( called the cerenkov image ) , the geometrical features of which depend upon the nature ( mass ) of the cosmic - ray primary which initiated the cascade . the technique has been successfully employed by various imaging cerenkov telescopes including tactic to detect vhe gamma - ray signals from a number of galactic and extragalactic sources[7,8 ] .",
    "the tactic ( tev atmospheric cerenkov telescope with imaging camera ) telescope at mt.abu ( 24.6@xmath19 n ; 72.0@xmath19 e ; 1300 m asl ) comprises a 3.6 m aperture , tessellated light collector of overall parabolic shape mounted on an altitude - azimuth mount and equipped with a 349-pixel imaging camera at its focal plane [ 10,11 ] .",
    "the imaging camera provides a field of view of 3@xmath19 radius with a uniform pixel resolution of 0.31@xmath19 . using a topological trigger based on a coincidence(@xmath20 @xmath4 20ns ) between nearest - neighbour , non - collinear triplets ( 3nct ) in the central 225 pixels ( 15@xmath2115 ) , the imaging telescope records cerenkov images of extensive air showers initiated by primary gamma - rays of @xmath1 1.5 tev and primary hadrons of energy @xmath1 3 tev from the vertical direction[10 ] .",
    "the images are composed of cerenkov photon intensity observed by each pixel in the form of charge to digital converter counts(cdc ) . the effective collection area ( area of cerenkov light pool at ground level ) of the system has been estimated to be @xmath4 3@xmath2210 @xmath23 @xmath24[17 ] . both the threshold detection energy and the effective detection area increase with the zenith angle of observation[10,12 ] .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on the analysis of simulated cerenkov images produced by several primary species like gamma - rays , protons , ne and fe nuclei .",
    "the simulations have been performed for the 349@xmath2pixel imaging camera of the tactic telescope using the corsika ( version 6.51 ) air shower simulation code[14,15,16 ] , supplemented by appropriate custom built software to take into account atmospheric absorption , reflection at the tactic light collector surface , pmt characteristics and the night sky background induced shot - noise fluctuations[7,13 ] . for each primary species 6,00,000 showers in different energy ranges ( 2tev , 4tev , 5tev ,",
    "8tev , 10tev , 15tev , 20tev , 30tev ) with energy spectral index of -2.5 , -2.76 , -2.64 and -2.60 were simulated for gamma - rays , protons , neon and fe respectively .",
    "all primary particles were assumed to be incident isotropically within the @xmath4 4@xmath19diameter field of view of the trigger pixels along a zenith direction of 50@xmath19 .",
    "the large value of zenith angle was deliberately chosen to obtain a larger effective area of detection with a corresponding increase in the energy threshold as mentioned earlier .",
    "independent simulations of the tactic telescope carried out earlier have shown that the detection threshold for gamma - rays at @xmath1 45@xmath19 zenith angle increases to @xmath4 10 tev ( 2 tev for vertical ) while the effective collection area increases to @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath24[12,17 ] . in this simulation study , we have also evaluated the effective collection area for 5tev gamma - rays for the tactic telescope at zenith direction of 50@xmath19 as @xmath4 7.07@xmath21 10@xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "all the simulated cerenkov images were subjected to similar cleaning and parameterization procedure in order to derive the hillas image parameters [ 18 ] and the recently introduced fractal and wavelet parameters as described briefly below .",
    "the simulated cerenkov images recorded at core distances varying from 10 - 400 m have been parameterized following the well - known second order moment analysis of the derived photo - electron counts in the image pixels .",
    "hillas shape parameters[18 ] , namely length ( l ) , width(w ) , azwidth ( a ) , distance ( d ) , miss ( m ) , orientation angle(@xmath25 ) and size ( s ) were determined for each simulated image .",
    "the derived values were sorted as an independent set , for core distances @xmath26 400 m for a comparative analysis .      the longitudinal and lateral development of air showers , represented by the height of shower maximum , the number of relativistic electrons and muons , the angular and spatial distribution of cerenkov photons and their total number varies with the primary mass .",
    "this produces differences in the structure of cerenkov images which can be recognized through pattern recognition techniques .",
    "fractal and wavelet parameters quantify the cerenkov image structure on different scale lengths , the former characterizing the global structure of photon distribution in the image while the latter characterize more localized structures[19,20,24,25 ] . the basic motivation and",
    "the technique employed for fractal and wavelet analysis of cerenkov images has been described in detail in[21 - 25 ] .",
    "we have followed an essentially similar procedure to calculate fractal moments and dimensions as well as wavelet moments and dimensions of different order .",
    "there has been increasing interest in wavelet based approach in the recent years due to its success in several applications .",
    "the wavelet transform is a two parameter transform[26 - 28 ] .",
    "the two parameter domains of the wavelet tranform are dilation ( scaling or compression ) and translation ( space ) .",
    "the advantage of using wavelets in the signal or structure analysis is the ability to perform local analysis of the signal or structure i.e to zoom on any interval of time and space . as such wavelet analysis has the ability to reveal the subtle details of the data which other analysis techniques fail to detect .",
    "wavelet analysis is regarded as the sequence of versatile filtering approach which will allow to examine the very minute stuctures left after filtering of the images at different scale lengths i.e to zoom at any interval of frequency , time or space of the signal and enables us to detect some hidden aspect of the data or image and brings out corrections to the image analysis .",
    "the pattern recognition technique for gamma - hadron separation employs fractal and wavelet analysis of cerenkov images to exploit differences in the structure of the recorded images due to differences in the longitudinal and lateral development of showers initiated by the two primary species .",
    "showers initiated by primary gamma - rays and protons produce different numbers of relativistic electrons and muons and also have different heights ( and lateral extents ) of shower maximum .",
    "these differences lead to structures in the cerenkov image on different scale lengths which can be parameterized through multifractal and wavelet dimensions and moments of different order[19 - 24 ] .",
    "the usual procedure for calculating these parameters involves dividing the cerenkov image into m = 4 , 16 , 64 , 256 equally sized , non - overlapping cells and finding the number of cdc counts in each cell ( 6.5 cdc = 1 photo - electron ) .",
    "the multifractal moments of order q(q = 2@xmath2 6 ) are calculated from the following relation :    @xmath27^{q } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where n is the total number of cdc counts in the image , @xmath28 is the cdc count in the j@xmath29 cell and q= 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 is the order of fractal moment .",
    "the wavelet moments are obtained as follows : @xmath30^{q } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the fractal scale length is given by @xmath31 = @xmath32 m    both the fractal moment @xmath33 as well as the wavelet moment @xmath34 exhibit a proportionality with the scale length which can be expressed as ,    @xmath35    the fractal and wavelet dimensions of order q are then determined from the following relations :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the slopes of the line between natural logarithm with scale length @xmath39 of @xmath33(m ) and @xmath34(m ) respectively . since wavelet dimensions are more sensitive to local structures in the photon distribution in cerenkov images , they are expected to have better efficiency for gamma - hadron separation as proton - initiated showers are known to have a non - uniform structure due to contributions from pions and muons[20 - 25 ] .",
    "fig.1 shows a composite plot of the frequency distribution of image shape parameters derived for showers initiated by 5 - 20 tev gamma - rays , protons , ne and fe primaries with shower cores located at @xmath26 400 m from the tactic imaging telescope .",
    "we find that the distributions for the shape parameters length and width ( l , w ) show a clear distinction between gamma - ray , proton and ne / fe induced showers , especially a clear distinction between gamma - ray and hadron initiated showers . while on the other hand , the distributions for the alpha(@xmath25 ) , distance(d ) and miss(m ) parameters do not exhibit any substantial dependence on the primary mass indicating that these parameters can have a limited application in primary mass segregation .",

    "the cerenkov imaging telescope tactic has been used to search for tev gamma - ray signals from several galactic and extragalactic sources and has successfully detected emission from the crab nebula , mkn 421 and mkn 501[29,30,31 ] .",
    "the telescope is also used to monitor an off - source or background region where it tracks a region of sky away from the source direction in order to provide an independent measure of the cosmic - ray background rate and also to validate the gamma - ray signal retrieval methodology .",
    "the fractal dimensions obtained from these cerenkov images showed no potential in terms of segregation of events on the basis of mass because of significant overlaps of distributions due to large background contribution .",
    "these simulated event values also yield a cosmic - ray proton composition of 87%  which is close to the experimentally measured proton abundance of @xmath4 89%  at tev energies .",
    "the gamma - ray to proton ratio determined from these values is also in close agreement with the value of 0.001 at tev energies reported from other atmospheric cerenkov telescope systems[32 ] while as the protons out number other species by few orders of magnitude .",
    "we have also subjected cerenkov images of various cosmic - ray primaries recorded by tactic during off - source observation runs to the above discussed fractal and wavelet analysis to investigate whether the @xmath0 parameter distribution leads to the expected cosmic - ray mass composition .",

    "it has been shown that , while hillas image parameters of atmospheric cerenkov events recorded in an imaging cerenkov telescope are able to separate protons from all other nuclei , the image parameters are rather inefficient in segregating nuclei of different masses .",
    "our analysis confirms this fact even though we find that the image parameters like width and azwidth have the potential to separate the primaries into groups of light ( protons and ne ) and heavy ( fe ) nuclei .",
    "several workers [ 34,35 ] have also investigated the efficiency of the temporal characteristics of atmospheric cerenkov pulses for primary mass segregation .",
    "it has been reported that while some simple pulse shape parameters , like pulse rise time , full - width at half maximum and pulse decay time , carry information useful for cosmic - ray mass composition studies , the efficiency for primary mass segregation can not be quantified in view of the limited simulation database",
    ". a detailed feasibility study of cosmic - ray composition measurements with cerenkov telescopes using fractal parameters of the recorded cerenkov images has been presented earlier[23 ] .",
    "it has been shown that the mass sensitivity of all the parameters increases with the image size , possibly because of the decreasing event by event fluctuations with increasing primary energy(@xmath4 size ) . however , a separation in more than two or three mass groups seems prohibited by the relatively poor mass resolution .",
    "our results show that for primary hadrons of different masses with individual energies pre - selected to produce different amounts of cerenkov light in the atmosphere , very efficient mass segregation is produced by the wavelet dimension @xmath0 .",
    "as already noted , we find that the frequency distributions of @xmath0 values for the three primary nuclear species ( p , ne and fe ) , considered by us in the simulations , peaks at distinctly separate values with negligible mutual overlap . to conclude , we have shown from our preliminary simulation - based study , that cerenkov image shape parameters are able to separate primary cosmic - ray events into two or three groups of nuclei in terms of their mass but are inefficient in segregating the events in terms of primary mass on an event by event basis .",
    "however , we find that the wavelet dimension parameter @xmath0 of the cerenkov image , has immense potential for event by event segregation(21,22,23 ) of the recorded events in terms of the primary mass .",
