    "* apparent luminosities . *",
    "the advantage of leaving the assumed distance @xmath19 free , is that a suitable value can be chosen for each application . when determining the distance to the coma cluster a reference distance of 10pc is less suitable than a reference distance measured in mpc .",
    "the disadvantage is that each apparent luminosity must be accompanied explicitly by a mention of the assumed distance @xmath19 .",
    "this disadvantage can be removed if we agree to limit choices of @xmath19 to integer powers of 10 .",
    "the power used can then be added to the index : @xmath62 would denote the apparent luminosity for @xmath17mpc , and @xmath63 the apparent luminosity for @xmath64pc .",
    "the numbers 1 - 9 would suffice for any practical purpose .    in practice a flux often represents a weighted average over a filter .",
    "one can then replace the wavelength in the index with the filter name . thus @xmath65 is the apparent luminosity derived from the average flux in the @xmath52 filter , for @xmath64kpc .",
    "* sample lecture notes . * to test the viability of using monochromatic luminosities , i have re - written sections of my lecture notes for a course on _ life of the stars : from dust to black holes _ that i teach to first year physics &  astronomy students in utrecht .",
    "the course is in dutch and uses si units .",
    "english versions of the re - written sections can be found on my website :          it may be argued that an advantage of the magnitude system is that it makes explicit that any flux measurement is based on flux ratios with calibrated sources .",
    "it appears to me that this should be obvious anyway : remember that radio and x/@xmath67 astronomers do very well without magnitudes .",
    "if a miracle happens , i.e.  if reason prevails , and enough astronomers agree that we should stop using magnitudes , we may wish to avoid a proliferation of different notations and choices by asking the appropriate committees of the _ international astronomical union _ to define the method and notation of preference .",
