    "nbse@xmath0 is certainly one of the most intensively studied superconducting materials for several reasons .",
    "first , its transition temperature ( @xmath1 ) is about 7k and its upper critical field not much larger than 4 t perpendicular ( @xmath2 , c - direction ) and 12 t parallel ( @xmath3 , ab - direction ) to the nb planes.@xcite accordingly , most part of the superconducting phase diagram is accessible to experiment , in contrast to many other materials .",
    "furthermore , large high quality single crystals with almost negligible vortex pinning effects can be grown .",
    "introducing a small amount of disorder ( e.g. by particle irradiation ) may lead to the emergence of the well known fishtail effect,@xcite which is still discussed a lot by the superconductivity community .",
    "moreover , nbse@xmath0 was the first material , in which scanning tunneling microscopy was successfully employed for observing vortex cores or distributions @xcite and it is still widely used for such investigations .",
    "finally , the charge density wave state , formed below about 33k,@xcite allows studying the effect of competing order parameters , which is an important issue for high temperature superconductors .",
    "recently , nbse@xmath0 was suggested to be a two- or multi - band superconductor , which was confirmed by several experiments ( e.g. refs .  ) , but usually an alternative interpretation of the results in terms of an anisotropic s - wave single - band scenario could not be excluded . in this paper",
    "we provide further evidence for the two - band scenario .",
    "the field dependence of the reversible magnetization - @xmath4 - is compared with ginzburg landau theory , showing that @xmath4 can not be reliably described by the anisotropic single - band scenario , but by multi - band superconductivity .",
    "evaluating the curves reveals the anisotropy and other superconducting parameters which are not only temperature but also significantly field dependent .    more generally , following the discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 , multi - band scenarios were announced for a lot of materials including fe - pnictides , borocarbides , heavy fermions , and even cuprates,@xcite etc .",
    "however , the experimental evidence was often based on poor arguments ( like , e.g. , the observation of a temperature dependent anisotropy ) and the anisotropic single - band scenario could rarely be eliminated . therefore , a method for distinguishing between the two scenarios is clearly desirable , which is provided by our approach . at the same time , all basic mixed state parameters can be assessed in this way .",
    "two nbse@xmath0 single crystals grown by a standard chemical vapor transport technique with sizes @xmath5 mm@xmath6 and @xmath7 mm@xmath6 were investigated .",
    "both have a @xmath1 of 7.15k and a small transition width of about 0.1k .",
    "the smaller crystal was mainly used for confirming the results of the larger one .",
    "measurements of the magnetic moment parallel to the applied field ( @xmath8 ) as a function of the applied field ( @xmath9 t , @xmath10 t m a@xmath11 ) were carried out at temperatures from 2k to about 10k in our squids .",
    "the curve above @xmath1 ( at 10k ) was subtracted from the superconducting signal to get rid of the temperature independent background signal ( which was non - significant in most cases ) . in all measurements ,",
    "most parts of the magnetization curves were reversible .",
    "therefore , the reversible magnetization could be obtained directly from @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the sample volume ) . in the case of irreversibility ,",
    "the reversible signal had to be calculated from the irreversible parts at increasing ( @xmath14 ) and decreasing ( @xmath15 ) field via @xmath16 .",
    "minor corrections to the field coming from the critical current were considered numerically as described in ref .  .",
    "finally , the magnetic induction @xmath17 was evaluated via @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the demagnetization factor of the sample , and @xmath4 obtained .",
    "fitting @xmath4 from single - band ginzburg landau ( gl ) theory to the experiment results in two parameters , the upper critical field ( @xmath20 ) , which is the field where @xmath21 vanishes for the first time , and @xmath22 , the gl parameter . for simplicity",
    ", the gl results were approximated by simpler ( but quite accurate ) equations given in ref .",
    "( we used eq .",
    "23 of that reference leading to deviations from the exact behavior by less than 3.5% ) .",
    "we point out that other approximations or even numerical solutions of the reversible magnetization @xmath4 may be applied , which are obtained from gl theory or other models .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] presents results of the experiments and the fitting procedure .",
    "the full circles in the inset of panel ( a ) show the low - field part of the measured magnetization loop @xmath23 for @xmath24 at 4.2k .",
    "a significant hysteresis occurs only at very low fields ( below about 20mt , which is @xmath25 ) and this region was excluded from the reversible curves presented by the open circles in the figure .",
    "the dashed lines show the best single - band gl fit to the whole superconducting part ( from about @xmath26 to @xmath27 ) and therefore represent the results we expect from a single - band superconductor . here , @xmath22 was the only fit parameter while @xmath28 was taken from the point , where the experimental curves reach zero .",
    "enormous differences between experiment and the best gl fits are evident ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) at both field directions and all temperatures ( 2 - 6.6k ) .",
    "these deviations become even more apparent when fitting the gl theory only to the high- or low - field region ( in the latter case , also @xmath28 is fitted ) as illustrated by the solid lines in fig .",
    "we conclude that nbse@xmath0 obviously does not behave like an anisotropic single - band superconductor .",
    "the gl theory holds strictly only sufficiently close to the phase transition and @xmath1 . at low temperatures and far from @xmath27 some deviations",
    "are expected , but usually gl theory is quite successful over the whole field and temperature range . nevertheless , to clarify this point , we fitted the single - band gl theory to magnetization curves of nb and v@xmath29si , which are single - band superconductors . in all cases",
    "the gl fit showed reliable agreement with experiment over the whole field range , as illustrated , e.g. , in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) for v@xmath29si .",
    "fair agreement between gl theory and @xmath4 data was also found in the more anisotropic superconductors @xcite yba@xmath0cu@xmath30o@xmath31 , nd@xmath32ce@xmath33cuo@xmath34 , and yba@xmath0cu@xmath29o@xmath35 .    in the next step we analyzed possible two - band effects . in the anisotropic single - band scenario , properties like the energy gap or the coupling strength vary within one band , while in the multi - band model@xcite superconducting charge carriers exist in two ( or more ) electron bands at the fermi surface characterized by two ( or more ) sets of parameters .",
    "two - band behavior can be observed if two of the parameter sets are significantly different , e.g. for the upper critical field or the anisotropy , and if both bands contribute substantially to the overall properties .",
    "additionally , interband coupling ( pairing of electrons from different bands ) is expected , which leads , e.g. , to one single transition temperature of both bands .",
    "even quite small interband coupling strengths would strongly mask the superconducting transition of the band with the lower values of @xmath36 and @xmath28 , which , however , does not mean that the properties follow the behavior of a conventional single - band superconductor.@xcite while the temperature dependence of most quantities is often quite similar for anisotropic single - band and two - band materials , the field dependence is rather different . to analyze two - band effects in the experiment",
    ", we separated @xmath4 into a high- and a low - field region and fitted both regions independently by single - band gl theory ( see solid lines of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    in the high - field region",
    ", good agreement was achieved in the range from about 0.6 @xmath2 to @xmath2 for @xmath24 and from 0.5 @xmath3 to @xmath3 for @xmath37 at all temperatures .",
    "this indicates that superconductivity of the second band is suppressed at those high - fields and only the single - band properties of the band with the larger upper critical field ( indicated by the superscript @xmath38 ) survive .",
    "some effects of interband coupling can not be excluded , but are expected to be small .",
    "accordingly , the high - field gl fit is assumed to roughly provide the single - band parameters of the @xmath38-band ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] ) .    turning to lower fields in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the discrepancy between the experimental data and the high - field single - band gl fit increases , which we ascribe to the influence of a second band with a smaller @xmath28 ( superscript @xmath39 ) . with decreasing field",
    "the @xmath39-band becomes more dominant ( particularly for @xmath37 ) , but the contribution of @xmath40 does not become negligible .",
    "therefore , single - band behavior is not expected and the low - field gl fit only provides effective parameters ( index lf ) of the overall superconducting behavior , although more indicative of the @xmath39-band .",
    "the fit interval ranged from @xmath41 to @xmath42 for @xmath24 , which was the largest interval that enabled good matching at all temperatures .",
    "the fit parameters are more affected by reducing the interval than in the high - field regime , but the major findings are not concerned . to be consistent , we applied the same field interval in absolute values for @xmath37 , which roughly corresponds to @xmath43 to @xmath44 .    to come closer to the single - band properties of the @xmath39-band",
    ", we subtracted the @xmath38-band gl fit from the experimental data .",
    "however , pure single - band behavior of the remaining @xmath4 ( @xmath45 ) is still not expected and indeed not observed due to interband coupling ( which might dominate , where @xmath45 approaches zero , i.e. near @xmath28 of the @xmath39-band ) and possible additional superconducting bands .",
    "accordingly , the field interval , where single - band gl theory matched well was similar as for the effective lf regime before subtracting the @xmath38-band .",
    "in contrast to the lf regime , however , the thermodynamic critical field ( @xmath46 , see tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] ) of the @xmath39-band is almost independent of the field orientation as expected for a single band ( small deviations are ascribed to the interband coupling and experimental uncertainties ) .",
    "the results of the fitting procedure are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and tab .",
    "@xmath47 ( @xmath38-band ) follows well the behavior of simple conventional superconductors ( full circles in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "for extrapolating the data to 0k the model @xmath48^b$ ] ( lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) was applied which matches best for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 t .",
    "the same model leads to @xmath52 t ( @xmath37 ) . in the latter case",
    ", we observe a positive curvature of @xmath28 near @xmath1 , while @xmath47 is linear in this regime . the corresponding gl parameters ( @xmath22 , fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) decrease strongly with increasing temperature .",
    "extrapolation gives roughly @xmath53 and @xmath54 as well as @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath39-band upper critical fields are also well fitted by the above model leading to much smaller results at 0k , namely @xmath57 t and @xmath58 t .",
    "also the gl parameters decrease and show a less pronounced temperature dependence , i.e. , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 . the effective parameters ( which address the sum of the @xmath38- and @xmath39-band ) of the low - field regime deviate only slightly from the @xmath39-band data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the above results lead to the anisotropies @xmath63 and @xmath64 illustrated in panel ( c ) of fig .",

    "@xmath66 and almost constant ( open circles ) , i.e. close to the value usually reported for nbse@xmath0,@xcite but drops to 2.3 at 7k . such a temperature dependence corresponds to the positive curvature of @xmath67 near @xmath1 and is , in general , a characteristic of both , two - band@xcite and anisotropic single - band@xcite superconductivity .",
    "the anisotropy of @xmath22 ( full circles ) is almost identical to @xmath68 ( open circles ) in the high - field regime . at lower fields",
    "the anisotropy of the gl properties is considerably reduced .",
    "we obtain @xmath69 ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) and @xmath72 ( @xmath70 , @xmath73 ) , thus almost isotropic behavior .",
    "the small differences in @xmath68 and @xmath74 could result from the larger experimental uncertainties in this regime .    in summary ,",
    "the anisotropy of nbse@xmath0 changes strongly with the applied field from a large value ( @xmath75 ) at high fields ( @xmath76 ) to almost isotropic behavior at low fields ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) .",
    "it seems impossible to explain this behavior by a single - band model , i.e. a two- or multi - band model is needed .",
    "our results suggest the existence of a strongly anisotropic ( @xmath38 ) band with a large @xmath28 , and a second almost isotropic ( @xmath39 ) band with a lower @xmath28 ( or , to be consistent with two - band theory : both bands may have the same @xmath28 due to interband coupling , but the properties of the @xmath39-band are strongly suppressed at high fields ) .",
    "we further point out , that the anisotropies of @xmath28 and @xmath22 are equal or quite similar , when acquired at the same field and temperature .",
    "accordingly , this holds also for the anisotropy of all further parameters , such as the magnetic penetration depth ( @xmath79 ) or the coherence lengths ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "these anisotropies were often claimed to be quite different in the two - band superconductor mgb@xmath0 .",
    "but detailed evaluations showed that the situation is actually the same as in nbse@xmath0 , i.e. all parameters have the same anisotropy.@xcite the misinterpretation in mgb@xmath0 usually originated from measuring the anisotropies of different properties at different applied fields , e.g. that of @xmath80 at high fields ( from the @xmath28 anisotropy ) and that of @xmath79 at low fields .",
    ".[tab1 ] summary of mixed - state parameters of single crystalline nbse@xmath0 at 0k in the @xmath38- and @xmath39-band and the effective low - field ( lf ) regime .",
    "minor inconsistencies with the gl relations occur from extrapolating the experimental data to 0k . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     further parameters were calculated by applying the well known gl relations ( e.g. ref .  ) , namely @xmath80 , @xmath79 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ( the lower critical fields ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of these quantities was fitted by the same ( general ) model as @xmath28 and the results at 0k are listed in tab .",
    "additionally , @xmath81 of the whole sample was obtained from integrating the reversible magnetization curve,@xcite i.e. @xmath83 , resulting in about 120 mt at 0k .      our results are consistent with most findings from literature .",
    "for instance , the fermi level of nbse@xmath0 is known to be crossed by three electron bands , one is related to se-4p orbitals and shows a rather three dimensional pancake like sheet , and the other two to nb-4d orbitals each leading to two rather two - dimensional ( cylindrical ) fermi sheets.@xcite there is general consensus that a superconducting gap opens in both nb bands .",
    "investigations by arpes@xcite at 5.3k resulted in gap values of 0.9 - 1.0mev , but no gap was detected on the se bands .",
    "on the other hand , scanning tunneling spectroscopy@xcite revealed a broader range of gap values from about 1.4 to 0.7 ( or even 0.4 ) mev close to 0k .",
    "the band , on which the smaller gaps exist , was not clearly identified , but it was argued , that the smaller gaps may open on the se bands , which would not necessarily contradict the arpes measurements , since the smaller gap could be suppressed near @xmath1 in a two - band model.@xcite it is plausible to associate the @xmath38-band , which has the higher @xmath28 , with the larger gap ( @xmath84 ) and thus the @xmath39-band with the smaller gap ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the fact that the superconducting properties of the @xmath39-band are nearly isotropic may favor assigning @xmath85 to the more three dimensional se - band . on the other hand , ab - initio calculations revealed that the electron density of states of the se band at the fermi level - @xmath86 - is only about 5% of the overall value,@xcite which makes a substantial contribution of the se bands to the superconducting behavior questionable .",
    "moreover , applying the bcs relations for the condensation energy density @xmath87 with @xmath46 from tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] , results in similar @xmath86 values for both bands , as was actually found for the two nb bands in ref .   and",
    "thus favors a scenario , in which the two nb bands are responsible for the two - band effects .",
    "it may be concluded that some microscopic aspects remain unclear and need further investigations .",
    "we note further that our results are in fair agreement with those from a specific - heat study.@xcite fitting the field dependence of the specific heat data by a simple two - band model led to similar upper critical fields and anisotropies of the two bands as in our study .",
    "finally , we wish to mention the remarkable qualitative resemblance of the two - band properties in nbse@xmath0 and mgb@xmath0 , for which a similar analysis@xcite also demonstrated a highly anisotropic band ( @xmath88-band ) being dominant at high magnetic fields and a quite isotropic low - field band ( @xmath89-band ) , with similar values for the upper critical fields and the anisotropies , but a larger transition temperature ( of almost 40k ) .",
    "we point out that the mixed - state parameters obtained by our approach in mgb@xmath0 are in good agreement with results derived from other methods , even for the band with the lower @xmath20 .",
    "there is also cumulative evidence for multi - band superconductivity in the family of the fe - pnictide superconductors ( e.g. refs . ) .",
    "contrary to nbse@xmath0 and mgb@xmath0 , however , the anisotropy of the upper critical field ( i.e. , the high - field value of @xmath90 ) seems to be smaller than that at low fields @xcite(i.e .",
    "the anisotropy of the penetration depth or of the lower critical field ) .",
    "this would indicate that the band with the larger upper critical field is less anisotropic .",
    "more recent results suggest , however , that a proper description of experimental data is only possible by taking three or more bands into account.@xcite further insight might be gained when reversible magnetization curves over the whole field range become available for these materials .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the reversible magnetization of nbse@xmath0 can not be reliably explained by a standard anisotropic single - band scenario . applying a simple two - band model reveals the anisotropy and other mixed - state parameters as a function of magnetic field and temperature .",
    "we found a strongly anisotropic band ( @xmath91 ) that dominates at high fields and a second almost isotropic band relevant only at low fields .",
    "the method can be applied to other materials to distinguish between single - band and multi - band superconductivity and to acquire at the same time all basic mixed - state parameters ."
