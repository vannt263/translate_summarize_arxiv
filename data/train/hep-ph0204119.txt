    "there are sound theoretical and experimental reasons for studying flavor  changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes .",
    "such transitions , being forbidden at tree level , provide stringent tests of the standard model ( sm ) at the loop level . besides , fcncs form a natural arena for discovering indirect effects of possible tev  scale extensions of the sm such as supersymmetry . among all the fcnc phenomena , the rare decays of the @xmath8 mesons are particularly important as many of the nonperturbative effects are small and under control .",
    "in addition to having already determined the branching ratio of @xmath11 @xcite and the cp asymmetry of @xmath12 @xcite , experimental activity in @xmath8 physics , has begun to probe fcnc phenomena in semileptonic @xmath8 decays @xcite .",
    "therefore , with increasing data and statistics , these experiments are expected to give precise measurements on long and short  distance effects in semileptonic decays , @xmath13 @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) . the key physical quantities that can be measured are the branching ratios , cp asymmetries and several lepton asymmetries .    in searching for the physics beyond the sm",
    "it is often necessary to deal with quantities that differ significantly from their sm counterparts .",
    "this is because there are large uncertainties coming from the hadronic form factors making it hard to disentangle new physics effects from those of the hadronic dynamics .",
    "for this reason , the pseudoscalar channel @xmath14 provides a unique opportunity , since the forward  backward asymmetry @xmath18 in this channel",
    "is extremely small in the sm ( due to a suppression of order @xmath19 ) , and this remains true in any of its extensions unless a scalar  scalar type four  fermion operator such as @xmath20 provides a significant contribution to the decay amplitude .",
    "clearly , such operator structures can arise only from the exchange of a scalar between the quark and lepton lines with flavor  violating couplings to the quarks .",
    "for instance , by extending the sm higgs sector to two su(2 ) doublets , operator structures of the form ( [ oper ] ) can be generated @xcite excluding the possibility of @xmath21 @xmath22 tree level fcncs .",
    "although the coefficient @xmath23 in eq.([oper ] ) is still proportional to the lepton mass , it can receive an enhancement when the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath24 is large .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) , is one of the most favoured extensions of the sm which stabilizes the scalar sector against ultraviolet divergences , and naturally avoids the dangerous tree level fcnc couplings by coupling the higgs doublet @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) to up ",
    "type quarks ( down  type quarks and charged leptons ) .",
    "the soft  breaking of susy at the weak scale generates ( @xmath27 ) a variety of new sources for tree level flavor violation depending on the structure of the soft terms , and ( @xmath28 ) radiatively generates various fcnc couplings even if the flavor violation is restricted to the ckm matrix . the first effect , which can not be determined theoretically , is strongly constrained by the fcnc data @xcite , and therefore , as a predictive case , it is convenient to restrict all flavor  violating transitions to the charged  current interactions where they proceed via the known ckm angles .",
    "this is indeed the case in various susy  breaking schemes where hidden sector breaking is transmitted to the observable sector via flavor ",
    "blind interactions @xmath13 gauge  mediated and minimal gravity  mediated scenarios .",
    "this minimal flavor violation scheme adopted here is well motivated by minimal supergravity in which all scalars receive a common soft mass , @xmath29 , at the unification scale .",
    "the common origin for scalar masses is one of the parameter restrictions which define the constrained version of the supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) .",
    "the low energy sparticle spectrum in the cmssm is specified entirely by four parameters , and one sign .",
    "in addition to @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the remaining mass parameters are the gaugino masses and supersymmetry breaking trilinear mass terms .",
    "these too , are assumed to have common values , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , at the unification scale . in principle , there are two additional parameters , the higgs mixing mass , @xmath4 , and the supersymmetry breaking bilinear mass term , @xmath8 , but since it is common to choose @xmath33 as a free parameter and since we fix the sum of the squares of the two higgs vevs with @xmath34 , these two parameters are fixed by the requirements of low energy electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "one is left simply with a sign ambiguity for @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the parameters which define a cmssm model are @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "although flavor violation is restricted to the ckm matrix , radiative effects still generate fcnc transitions among which those that are enhanced at large values of @xmath3 are particularly important as the lep era ended with a clear preference to large values of @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is known that there are large @xmath3enhanced threshold corrections to the ckm entries @xcite allowing for higgs  mediated fcnc transitions @xcite .",
    "for instance , the holomorphic mass term for down  type quarks @xmath37 acquires a non - holomorphic correction @xmath38 where the latter term proportional to @xmath39 , which is not necessarily small at large @xmath3 .    in what follows",
    ", we will compute the forward  backward asymmetry of @xmath40",
    "decays in the mssm . after deriving the scalar exchange amplitudes ( [ oper ] )",
    ", we discuss several theoretical and experimental issues and then identify the regions of susy parameter space for which the asymmetry is enhanced .",
    "we compare our results with existing experimental and cosmological constraints .",
    "in general , the semileptonic decays @xmath40 proceed via the quark transitions @xmath41 .",

    "the wilson coefficients , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 have been computed to leading order in @xcite .",
    "higher order @xmath47 corrections , which are available for small @xmath48 in the sm @xcite , will not be considered .",
    "the coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath50 will be discussed below .",
    "the kinematical range for the normalized dilepton invariant mass in terms of the lepton and pseudo scalar masses is @xmath51 which includes the vector charmonium resonances @xmath52 whose effects are included in the @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , the four  fermion operators for the light quarks develop nonvanishing matrix elements , and these are also included in @xmath53 . at higher orders in @xmath54 , these effects contribute to @xmath55 as well @xcite .    the electromagnetic dipole coefficient @xmath55 is contributed by graphs with the w boson , charged higgs , and chargino penguins .",
    "the chargino contribution increases linearly with @xmath3 at leading order @xcite , and the inclusion of susy threshold corrections strengthens this dependence @xcite .",
    "this coefficient is directly constrained by the @xmath56 decay rate , and the experimental bounds can be satisfied with a relatively light charged higgs at very large values of @xmath3 . on the other hand , the coefficient of the vector ",
    "vector operator @xmath53 is generated by box diagrams , and carries a long  distance piece coming from the matrix elements of the light quark operators as well as the intermediate charmonium states @xcite . finally , the coefficient of the vector ",
    "pseudovector operator @xmath57 is generated by box graphs and is scale independent .",
    "both coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath57 are less sensitive to @xmath3 than is @xmath55 .    within the sm",
    ", these coefficients typically have the values @xmath58 , @xmath59 ( excluding its long  distance part ) , and @xmath60 @xcite which , however , are allowed to vary considerably within the existing bounds @xcite . the inclusion of susy contributions , for instance , implies large variations in @xmath55 ( even changing its sign ) , and typically a @xmath61 variation in @xmath53 and @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the scalar ",
    "scalar operators in the decay amplitude are generically induced by the exchange of the higgs scalars and suffer invariably from the @xmath62 suppression .",
    "therefore , these operators are completely negligible in the sm . however , in the mssm , this suppression is overcome by large @xmath3 effects where the charged higgs  top diagram is proportional to @xmath63 , and the chargino ",

    "finally , @xmath74 is the top quark yukawa coupling , @xmath75 is the light stop mass , and @xmath76 is the low energy value of the susy breaking top - yukawa trilinear mass term obtained from @xmath32 by the running of the rges",
    ". clearly , the charged higgs contribution , which is the dominant one in two  doublet models @xcite , is subleading compared to the chargino contribution .",
    "the sign of @xmath23 depends explicitly on @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , the forward  backward asymmetry in @xmath0 decays depends strongly on the sign of the @xmath4 parameter .    from the experimental point of view , it is useful to analyze the normalized forward  backward asymmetry defined as @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 being the angle between the momenta of @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",

    "the hadronic form factors are uncertain by @xmath96 , and this translates into an uncertainty of approximately @xmath97 in the branching ratio . especially for low @xmath48 , below the charmonium resonances ,",
    "the theoretical prediction for the branching ratio contains large uncertainties @xcite . therefore , theoretically the large dilepton mass region is more tractable . on top of the form factor uncertainties , there are further problems in treating the contributions of the charmonium resonances ( embedded in the wilson coefficient @xmath53 ) . for instance , the recent belle experiments @xcite , subtract such resonance contributions by vetoing the range @xmath98 .",
    "then the experimental bound on the branching ratio turns out to be @xmath99 which we will take into account in making the numerical estimates below .",
    "it can be also noted that the same decay mode has not been observed by babar : @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the vector kaon final states have not been observed yet : @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "one notes that , the asymmetry is large in regions of the parameter space where the branching ratio is depleted , and therefore , the belle lower bound on @xmath102 is an important constraint which can prohibit the asymmetry taking large marginal values . clearly , in the presence of @xmath23 , which can take large values in susy , the would ",
    "be experimental constraints on the @xmath103@xmath53 plane are lifted .",
    "furthermore , the pure leptonic decay modes , @xmath104 , depend directly on the wilson coefficients @xmath103 , @xmath23 and @xmath105 . in the sm ,",
    "@xmath106 which is approximately three orders of magnitude below the present bounds @xmath107 @xcite . the susy contributions , especially at large @xmath3 , can enhance the sm prediction typically by an order of magnitude , and the bounds can even be violated in certain corners of the parameter space @xcite . in what follows the constraints from @xmath108 as well as the muon @xmath10 ( as they are directly correlated @xcite )",
    "will be taken into account .",
    "we will refer to the constraints from @xmath109 and @xmath104 collectively as @xmath8factory constraints .",
    ".2 in    for the constraints on the susy parameter space to make sense it is necessary to be far from the regions of large hadronic uncertainties , and thus , below we will restrict the range of @xmath48 to lie well above the charmonium resonances and well below the kinematical end point . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we show the variation of the asymmetry with the normalized dilepton invariant mass , @xmath110 for various values of the susy parameters ( see below for further discussion of these choices ) .",
    "the irregularities in the @xmath48dependence of the asymmetry are similar to those in the @xmath111 decay .",
    "the various bumps and valleys come from the relative sizes of individual terms contributing to @xmath112 .",
    "it should be noted that in the region around the value @xmath113 , the @xmath48 dependence of the asymmetry is rather smooth .",
    "therefore , in forming the constant asymmetry contours in the space of susy parameters we will take @xmath113 ( corresponding to @xmath114 ) .    at low values of the asymmetry one should also take into account the final state electromagnetic interactions .",
    "indeed , photon exchange between the lepton and @xmath115 lines is expected to induce an asymmetry @xmath116 implying that only asymmetries @xmath112 larger than @xmath117 can be trusted to follow from susy effects , unless the interplay with the electromagnetic corrections is explicitly taken into account . for large values of asymmetry ,",
    "when the observation of the effect becomes feasible , higher order qcd effects ( not yet calculated ) can in principle modify our results somewhat .",
    "however , it is highly unlikely that these corrections will dramatically reduce the asymmetry discussed here .",
    "one should also note that in the limit of exact @xmath118 flavor symmetry , the asymmetries in @xmath119 and @xmath120 decays must be the same . due to @xmath118 breaking effects , which show up in different parameterizations of the form factors @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath121 for @xmath95 and @xmath94 transitions @xcite",
    ", their asymmetries are expected to differ slightly .",
    "clearly it is the lepton flavor that largely determines the size of the asymmetry , rather than the flavor of the final state pseudoscalar .",
    "finally , before starting to scan the susy parameter space , it is worth while discussing the sensitivity of @xmath112 to some of the parameters .",
    "first of all , as @xmath3 grows , two of the wilson coefficients , @xmath55 and @xmath23 , grow rapidly up to the bounds obtained from rates of the decays @xmath122 and @xmath123 . since @xmath124 > 0 $ ] and @xmath125 , @xmath126 $ ] increases with @xmath3 . however , this increase is much milder than the @xmath127 dependence of @xmath23 causing @xmath128 to take large negative ( positive ) values for @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) . therefore , large @xmath3 effects influence not only the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ afb ] ) but also the denominator @xmath129 ( proportional to the differential branching fraction ) via the destructive ( constructive ) interference with @xmath130 ( @xmath103 remains negative in susy ) for @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "however , as @xmath3 keeps growing , depending on the rest of the susy parameters , the effect of @xmath23 eventually becomes more important , and the asymmetry falls rapidly due to the enhanced branching ratio . in this sense ,",
    "the regions of enhanced asymmetry depend crucially on the sign of the @xmath4 parameter and the specific value of @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , as the expression of @xmath23 makes clear , there can be sign changes in the asymmetry in certain regions of the parameter space due to the relative sizes of the masses of the lighter chargino and stops .",
    "such effects will also give small asymmetries just like the @xmath6 case .",
    "our work extends a previous analysis of this asymmetry @xcite by including the large gluino exchange effects ( contained in the quantity @xmath131 in eq .",
    "( [ cmb ] ) ) and the explicit dependence on the sign of the @xmath4 parameter .",
    "in addition , we go beyond the work in @xcite as well as in the preceding work @xcite by resumming the higher order @xmath3 terms which increases the validity of the analysis at large values of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we note that a computation of the large @xmath3 effects can be carried out in the gaugeless limit @xcite which eliminates some of the diagrams considered in @xcite .    in the numerical analysis",
    "below , we will analyze the forward ",
    "backward asymmetry of the decays @xmath14 by taking into account the above  mentioned constraints from @xmath8 factories as well as other collider and cosmological constraints .",
    "we will be searching for those regions of the susy parameter space in which the asymmetry is enhanced .",
    "in particular , we will be particularly interested in the sensitivity of the asymmetry to @xmath3 , the sign of the @xmath4 parameter , as well as the common scalar mass @xmath29 and the gaugino mass @xmath31 .",
    "in our analysis , we include several accelerator as well as cosmological constraints . from the chargino searches at lep @xcite , we apply the kinematical limit @xmath132 104 gev .",
    "a more careful consideration of the constraint would lead to an unobservable difference in the figures shown below .",
    "this constraint can be translated into a lower bound on the gaugino mass parameter , @xmath31 and is nearly independent of other susy parameters .",
    "the lep chargino limit is generally overshadowed ( in the cmssm ) by the important constraint provided by the lep lower limit on the higgs mass : @xmath133 114.1 gev @xcite .",
    "this holds in the standard model , for the lightest higgs boson @xmath134 in the general mssm for @xmath135 , and almost always in the cmssm for all @xmath3 .",
    "the higgs limit also imposes important constraints on the cmssm parameters , principally @xmath31 , though in this case , there is a strong dependence on @xmath33 .",
    "the higgs masses are calculated here using feynhiggs  @xcite , which is estimated to have a residual uncertainty of a couple of gev in @xmath136 .",
    "we also include the constraint imposed by measurements of @xmath137  @xcite .",
    "these agree with the standard model , and therefore provide bounds on mssm particles , such as the chargino and charged higgs masses , in particular . typically , the @xmath137 constraint is more important for @xmath138 , but it is also relevant for @xmath139 , particularly when @xmath3 is large .",
    "the final experimental constraint we consider is that due to the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon .",
    "the bnl e821  @xcite experiment reported a new measurement of @xmath140 which deviates by 1.6 standard deviations from the best standard model prediction ( once the pseudoscalar - meson pole part of the light - by - light scattering contribution @xcite is corrected ) .",
    "although negative values of @xmath4 are no longer entirely excluded  @xcite , the 2-@xmath141 limit still excludes much of the @xmath138 parameter space @xcite .",
    "@xmath142 is allowed so long as either ( or both ) @xmath31 and @xmath29 are large .",
    "we also apply the cosmological limit on the relic density of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , @xmath143 , and require that 0.1 < _ h^2 < 0.3 [ ten ] the upper limit is rigorous , and assumes only that the age of the universe exceeds 12 gyr .",
    "it is also consistent with the total matter density @xmath144 , and the hubble expansion rate @xmath145 to within about 10 % ( in units of 100 km / s / mpc ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the lower limit in ( [ ten ] ) is optional , since there could be other important contributions to the overall matter density .",
    "the cosmologically allowed regions in the cmssm have been well studied @xcite .",
    "there are generally large , ` bulk ' regions of parameter space at low to moderate values of @xmath31 and @xmath29 at all values of @xmath33 .",
    "there are additional regions which span out to large values of @xmath31 due to co - annihilations with light sleptons , particularly the lighter @xmath146 @xcite . at large @xmath33",
    ", there are also regions in which the lightest neutralino sits on the s - channel pole of the pseudo - scalar and heavy scalar higgs producing ` funnel'-like regions @xcite",
    ". finally , there are the so - called ` focus - point ' regions @xcite which are present at very large values of @xmath29 .",
    "generally , these regions have a lower asymmetry ( because of the large value of @xmath29 ) , however , at values of @xmath147 , asymmetries as large as 10% are possible .",

    "the constraints from @xmath160 and @xmath10 only exclude a small portion of the parameter plane at the lower left . in this figure , it is the area above the cosmological shaded region which is excluded due to an excessive relic density .",
    "this figure illustrates the dependence of the asymmetries on the chargino and stop masses , and indeed , the asymmetry changes sign at fairly large @xmath29 and small @xmath31 .",
    "this effect results in a sign change in @xmath23 due to the competition between the stop and chargino masses . as fig . [",
    "fig4]a ) makes clear , the asymmetry is positive and remains below the @xmath202 level yielding essentially no observable signal at all .",
    "an example with @xmath203 and @xmath138 is shown in fig . [ fig4]b ) .",
    "while the cosmological region is similar to that in panel a ) , the constraint from @xmath160 is significantly stronger , as is the constraint from @xmath10 .",
    "the latter imply that the asymmetry is never much larger than @xmath204 .",
    "as one can see , it is difficult to get any observable effect at low values of @xmath3,for any sign of the @xmath4 parameter .    in the lower two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the contours of @xmath170 for larger values of @xmath33 . as one can see , the ` bulk ' cosmological regions are pushed to higher values of @xmath29 and we also see the appearance of the ` funnel ' regions where the lsp relic density is primarily controlled by @xmath205 s - channel annihilations . in panel c ) , there are large positive asymmetries ( @xmath206 ) in a broad region extending from @xmath207 all the way up to @xmath208 .",
    "the @xmath8factory constraints only exclude a small region in the bottom left corner bounded by @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "panel d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , on the other hand , shows that , for negative @xmath4 and large @xmath33 , the allowed range of asymmetry is around @xmath164 never reaching the @xmath211 level mainly due to the @xmath212 constraint .",
    "there are three cosmologically preferred strips , the wider one located in the region @xmath213 where the asymmetry is at most @xmath164 . for @xmath6",
    "the @xmath8factory constraints exclude two small regions bounded by @xmath214 and @xmath215 , and @xmath216 and @xmath217 which both are already excluded by @xmath9 and cosmology .",
    "we have discussed the forward  backward asymmetry of @xmath218 decays which is generated by the flavor  changing neutral current decays mediated by the higgs bosons .",
    "in addition to the known properties @xmath13 the smallness of the muon production asymmetry compared to the @xmath2 production , the approximate independence of the asymmetry to the flavor of the final state meson , the reduction of the hadronic uncertainties in the high dilepton mass region , @xmath219 we find that    * the remarkable enhancement of the asymmetry is a unique implication of susy not found in the sm and its two  doublet version .",
    "* the regions of large asymmetry ( @xmath206 ) always require @xmath5 , and when @xmath4 changes sign so does the asymmetry with an order of magnitude suppression in its size . *",
    "the asymmetry in the decay channels with the lepton pair @xmath220 is significantly larger ( approximately by the factor @xmath221 ) than in the channels with @xmath200 .",
    "thus in spite of a greater difficulty of restoring the kinematics in the events with @xmath2 leptons , these may still be advantageous for measuring the discussed asymmetry . *",
    "the asymmetry is not a monotonically increasing function of @xmath3 instead it is maximized at intermediate values above which the scalar fcnc effects dominate and enhance the branching ratio , and below which such fcnc are too weak to induce an observable asymmetry . *",
    "though @xmath175 strongly disfavors the negative values of @xmath4 , the present bounds from the muon @xmath10 measurement are much stronger , and it typically renders the asymmetry unobservably small . * the cosmological constraints are generally very restrictive . when @xmath222 gev , @xmath223 gev , @xmath224 and @xmath5 there is a relatively wide region where the asymmetry is @xmath186 for @xmath2 , and typically @xmath225 for muon final state .",
    "* the @xmath8factory constraints are generally too weak to distort the regions of observable asymmetry , and the regions excluded by them are already disfavoured by one or more of @xmath175 , @xmath226 lsp and @xmath212 .",
    "with increasing statistics it is expected that the branching ratios of semileptonic modes will be measured with better accuracy so that , for instance , the allowed range in ( [ belle ] ) will be narrowed . in this case , there may be useful constraints on regions of enhanced asymmetry .",
