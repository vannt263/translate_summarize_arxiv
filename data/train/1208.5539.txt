    "topological quantum systems are attracting considerable interest because of their fundamental importance in diverse areas of physics , ranging from quantum - field theory to semiconductor physics  @xcite , as well as emerging fields such as quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "a topological quantum system has topological phases of matter that are insensitive to local perturbations .",
    "for example , a recently proposed quantum model with quasi - local spin interactions possesses emergent topologically ordered states  @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas in the fractional quantum hall regime has non - abelian anyonic excitations near particular magnetic fields , which can be used for topological quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the search for naturally existing topological phases , there have also been wide - ranging theoretical efforts to design model hamiltonians and artificial lattice structures that possess nontrivial topological properties .",
    "one of the prominent candidates for topological quantum computation is the kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice  @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "this model can be described by a completely anisotropic hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 denote the coupling strengths of the @xmath5- , @xmath6- , and @xmath7-type bonds , respectively .",
    "using majorana fermion method  @xcite or jordan - wigner transformation  @xcite , the kitaev model can be analytically solved .",
    "it has two phases : a band insulator phase and a topological gapless phase  @xcite . in the insulator phase , which is equivalent to a toric code model for the same braiding statistics  @xcite ,",
    "the elementary excitations are abelian anyons . however , the vortices in the gapless phase are not well - defined because the rule of the braiding statistics is unclear in this case .",
    "an applied external magnetic field breaks the time reversal symmetry in the hamiltonian and opens a gap in the gapless phase .",
    "now the vortices obey a well - defined non - abelian anyonic statistics  @xcite . with possible non - abelian anyonic excitations , the kitaev model could play an important role in demonstrating anyonic statistics and in implementing topological quantum computing .",
    "( a).,width=268 ]    due to its strong anisotropicity , the kitaev model is unlikely to exist in a natural homogeneous physical system .",
    "an alternative but promising way to realize this model is to use artificial structures  @xcite , such as josephson junction arrays  @xcite , optical lattices  @xcite , and polar molecules  @xcite .",
    "however , with a josephson junction array , the magnetic term of the model hamiltonian can not be cancelled completely  @xcite , while with other proposals ( in either optical lattice or molecules ) extremely strict conditions are required , such as ultra - low temperatures .",
    "recently , various theoretical proposals of using coupled cavities to simulate basic spin - interactions and many - body models have been studied  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the xy spin model and the heisenberg model have been theoretically simulated in reference  @xcite and reference  @xcite , respectively . in reference",
    "@xcite , the @xmath8 and @xmath9 couplings were proposed to implement by using two laser fields ( here denoted as a and b ) , with the related coupling strengths tuned by varying the applied laser fields .",
    "in addition , the @xmath10 coupling was proposed to implement by using another two laser fields ( here denoted as c and d ) .",
    "however , these three types of spin couplings can not occur simultaneously . to solve this problem ,",
    "the suzuki - trotter formula was employed in reference  @xcite , which involves applying an appropriate repeated sequence of pulses that tunes on the laser fields a and b for a short interval of time after another interval of time in which the laser fields c and d are tuned on .",
    "this can in principle yield an anisotropic heisenberg hamiltonian with these three types of spin couplings .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an alternative approach to simultaneously implement all three different couplings of spins in a quantum model .",
    "however , in sharp contrast to the proposal in reference  @xcite , the simultaneous implementation of these three different spin couplings in our considered model is simply owing to the introduction of suitable cavity modes depending on the geometrical structure of the cavity lattice . moreover , our proposal is also experimentally accessible with currently existing technologies  @xcite . specifically , we show that a lattice of tunnel - coupled cavities can be tuned to emulate the strongly anisotropic kitaev lattice . in our case ,",
    "the basic element is a @xmath0-type three - level atom inside three cavities that are oriented in different directions , where the two long - lived atomic levels form an effective spin-@xmath11 ( qubit ) .",
    "the interactions between nearest - neighbor atoms are realized via the exchange of virtual photons between the coupled cavities .",
    "indeed , our scheme for building qubits and achieving inter - qubit interactions is quite general , so that complex many - body models can be constructed by changing the structure of the cavity lattice and/or by varying the driving laser fields , without making use of the suzuki - trotter formula that involves applying an appropriate repeated sequence of pulses  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we describe the design of our cavity lattice to simulate the kitaev model .",
    "we derive the effective hamiltonian of the system in two different cases in sec .  3 and then discuss the conditions for experimental implementation in sec .",
