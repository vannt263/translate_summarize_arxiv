    "the time required for stars in the stellar halo to exchange their energy and angular momentum is very long compared to the age of the galaxy .",
    "therefore , such stars preserve memories of their initial conditions , and so the structure of the stellar halo is intimately linked to the formation mechanism of the galaxy itself .",
    "this fundamental insight was already noted by @xcite .",
    "it is the reason why the stellar halo has attracted such interest despite containing only a small fraction of the total stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "stars diffuse more quickly in configuration space , as opposed to energy and angular momentum space .",
    "so , the spatial structure of the stellar halo may be smooth , even though it is built up from merging and accretion .    the simplest way of studying the stellar halo is through starcounts .",
    "typically , rr lyrae or blue horizontal branch stars ( bhbs ) are used as tracers , as they are relatively bright ( @xmath7 , e.g. @xcite ) and can be detected at radii out to @xmath0 100 kpc .",
    "the gathering of such data is painstaking work , and carries the price that sample sizes are often small .",
    "such studies are consistent with a stellar halo that is round in the outskirts ( with a minor - to - major axis ratio @xmath8 ) and more flattened in the inner parts with @xmath9 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . rather than selecting typical halo stars ,",
    "an alternative approach is to model deep star count data in pencil - beam surveys at intermediate and high galactic latitudes , allowing for contamination of the starcounts by the thin and thick disk populations .",
    "this was attempted by @xcite , who found a best - fit halo density law with flattening @xmath10 , together with a power - law fall - off @xmath11 of @xmath12 ( that is , @xmath13 ) . a similar , slightly later , attempt by @xcite using data in seven kapteyn selected areas yielded @xmath6 and @xmath14 .",
    "efforts to detect variations in the flattening with radius have also been undertaken .",
    "@xcite argued that the flattening changes from strongly flattened ( @xmath15 ) at 1 kpc to almost round at @xmath16 kpc .",
    "however , work by @xcite using a compilation of 340 rr lyraes and bhbs found a constant flattening of @xmath9 with no evidence for changes with radius , as well as and a power - law index @xmath17 .",
    "the most recent work by @xcite utilising 666 bhb stars from the 2df quasar redshift survey find that the halo is approximately spherical with a power - law index of @xmath18 out to @xmath19 kpc .",
    "similarly , @xcite studying main sequence turn - off ( msto ) stars from the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey find that the flattening is approximately constant at @xmath20 out to @xmath21 kpc .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has transformed our knowledge of the stellar halo .",
    "although it had been suspected that the stellar halo is criss - crossed with streams and substructures ever since the discovery of the disrupting sagittarius ( sgr ) , the sdss provided a memorable picture of the debris in _ the field of streams _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "a wealth of substructure has now been identified , including the sagittarius stream , the virgo overdensity and the hercules - aquila cloud ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this has been seen as vindication of modern theories of galaxy formation , which predict that stellar haloes are built up almost exclusively from the debris of disrupting satellites ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a number of studies have attempted to model the smooth halo component by avoiding these known substructures ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the results are only in very rough agreement , suggesting that the density profile of the milky way has a power - law slope in the range @xmath22 and a flattening varying from @xmath23 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    even though panoramic photometric surveys like sdss do provide a large sample of stellar halo tracers over a considerable portion of the sky",
    ", there is no consensus on the flattening and shape of the stellar halo .",
    "msto stars are commonly used tracers owing to their large numbers and the ease by which they can be photometrically identified ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of such stars centre around @xmath24 but have a wide range of values ( @xmath25 mag ) which limits the accuracy to which the density profile can be estimated .",
    "bhb stars are superior distance estimators ( @xmath26 ) , but are significantly scarcer than main sequence stars .",
    "moreover , they suffer from contamination by blue straggler ( bs ) stars due to their similar colours .",
    "bhb and bs stars can be distinguished by their balmer line profiles ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but this requires spectroscopic information .",
    "whilst spectroscopic samples can cleanly identify bhb stars , the variety of results on flattening ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and density fall - off ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) suggests that the completeness biases are difficult to understand and control .",
    "an independent constraint on the density profile of the stellar halo is provided by the velocity distribution of the halo stars .",
    "a kinematic analysis by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) suggests that the stellar halo comprises of two components with different density profiles and metallicities .",
    "the authors find that the density profile becomes shallower beyond @xmath27 kpc .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the studies by @xcite and @xcite , who find a significantly steeper density profile beyond @xmath28 kpc from the distribution of rr lyrae stars in sdss stripe 82 .",
    "a caveat to the interpretation of kinematic studies is that the density distribution is not measured directly but rather modelled by assuming a dark matter halo potential .",
    "therefore , the present state - of - play is distressingly inconclusive and a further attack on the problem of the shape of the stellar halo is warranted . in this study , we introduce a new method to model both bhb and bs stars based on photometric information alone .",
    "we make use of the sdss dr8 photometric data release which has now mapped an impressive @xmath29 deg@xmath2 of sky with both northern and southern coverage .",
    "in contrast to previous work , we combine both the wide sky coverage of the sdss with the accurate distance estimates provided by the bhb stars to model the density profile of the stellar halo out to @xmath30 kpc .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in ",
    "2.1 , we describe the sdss dr8 photometric data and our selection criteria for a - type stars",
    ". the remainder of  2 introduces the probability distribution for bhb and bs membership based on colour alone and outlines the absolute magnitude - colour relations for the two populations . in  4 , we describe our maximum likelihood method to determine the density profile of the stellar halo and in  4 we present our results .",
    "finally , we draw our main conclusions in  5 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) is an imaging and spectroscopic survey covering roughly @xmath31 of the sky . imaging data is obtained using a ccd camera ( @xcite ) on a 2.5 m telescope ( @xcite ) at apache point observatory , new mexico .",
    "images are obtained simultaneously in five broad optical bands ( @xmath32 ; @xcite ) .",

    "the more recent sdss data release covers both northern and southern latitudes .",
    "we exclude latitudes @xmath34 , so as to concentrate on regions well away from the plane of the galaxy . over the distance range probed by this work ,",
    "the sdss footprint ( @xmath35 ) covers approximately 20% of the total volume of the stellar halo . in this study",
    "we use blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) and blue straggler stars ( bs ) to map the density profile of the stellar halo .",
    "these a - type stars are selected by choosing stars in the following region in colour - colour space : @xmath36 this selection is similar to other work using a - type stars ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and is chosen to exclude main sequence stars , white dwarfs and qsos .",

    "we use the light curve catalogue compiled by @xcite and classify variable stars according to the criteria outlined in @xcite .",

    "note that the total stellar halo mass is believed to be @xmath146 ( e.g. @xcite ) so we are probing a significant fraction of the stellar halo ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "a rough idea of the amount of substructure present in the data can be attained by computing the rms deviation of the models about the data ( @xmath148 ) as defined by equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in @xcite : @xmath149 @xmath150 here , @xmath151 is the number of stars in bin @xmath152 , @xmath153 is the expected number from the model , @xmath154 is a poisson random deviate from the model value and @xmath155 is the total number of bins ( in @xmath156 , @xmath57 and @xmath157 ) . however , with a total of @xmath158 stars we can not afford to use a fixed bin size over the entire sky : pixels must be simultaneously large enough to contain ample stars and small enough to adequately sample the substructure . to circumvent this problem",
    ", we use the voronoi binning method of @xcite to partition the data in pixels on the sky .",
    "this adaptive binning method groups pixels together , forming ` superpixels ' , with the objective of obtaining a constant signal - to - noise ratio per bin .",
    "we choose the signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath159 ( assuming poisson noise ) to ensure the mean number of stars in each 2d bin is @xmath160 .",
    "we also check that our results are not affected by the choice of signal - to - noise .",
    "the stars are split into three @xmath40 band magnitude ranges , binned into @xmath161 @xmath162 pixels for full sky coverage which are then combined into @xmath163 superpixels using the procedure described above to estimate the overall @xmath148 values .",
    "these are given in the last two columns of table [ tab : like ] .",
    "as expected , our @xmath148 fraction is significantly reduced when the stars in the region of the virgo overdensity and sagittarius stream are removed : the estimated fraction of substructure reduces from @xmath164 to @xmath165 .",
    "however , further refinement of our model makes little difference to the @xmath148 fraction , even if the likelihood is increased .",
    "this is indicative of the resilience of our maximum likelihood method to relatively minor amounts of substructure present in the data .",
    "we illustrate the dependence of @xmath148 on spatial scale in fig .",
    "[ fig : superpix ] by grouping together superpixels with similar spatial scales and computing @xmath148 for each group .",
    "this shows how the fraction of substructure depends on the superpixel size ( in @xmath166 ) for different maximum likelihood models .",
    "@xmath148 is computed both with ( black lines ) and without ( red lines ) the stars in the vicinity of the virgo overdensity and the sagittarius stream .",
    "the spherical model has relatively large values of @xmath148 over all scales , illustrating the poor fit of this model to the data .",
    "the single and broken power - law oblate models show a scale dependence , whereby larger scales ( larger number of pixels ) have an increased @xmath148 fraction relative to smaller scales .",
    "similar behaviour is also true for the triaxial model but the @xmath148 fractions are slightly lower . as alluded to earlier , we suspect that this may be caused by the triaxial model describing some of the large - scale substructure ( namely the monocerus ring or parts of the sagittarius stream which have not been excised ) .    different lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : superpix ] show the dependence of the @xmath148 measure on the apparent magnitude of the tracers and hence correspond to different distances probed .",
    "the slight rise of the rms with magnitude indicates that higher fractions of substructure may be present at larger distances .",
    "this can be simply explained with the increase of the substructure lifetime with radius as governed by the orbital period of the infalling galactic fragments .",
    "when interpreting these plots , it is important to bear in mind that the smallest superpixels are biased towards the densest parts of the halo , while the emptiest regions are sampled by the largest agglomerations of 2d bins .",
    "this bias could potentially explain at least some of the trend with size .",
    "on the scales smaller than several tens of degrees , @xmath148 in our models is in the range @xmath167 indicating that the halo is _ not dominated _ by substructure and is relatively smooth .",
    "while there is evidence that the fraction of substructure increases with scale , this apparent increase in @xmath148 could also be caused by spurious pixels . in sparse regions , the grouping of many pixels , each containing very few stars , poses a limitation to this method .",
    "we have developed a new method to simultaneously model the density profile of both blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) and blue straggler ( bs ) stars based on their broad - band photometry alone .",
    "the probability of bhb or bs membership is defined by the locus of these stars in @xmath38 , @xmath39 space .",
    "we use these colour - based weights to construct the overall probability function for the density of the two populations .",
    "when applied to the a - type stars selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 8 ( dr8 ) photometric catalog , the best - fit stellar halo models are identified by applying a maximum likelihood algorithm to the data .",
    "based on the data from regions with @xmath168 , we find that the stellar halo is not spherical in shape , but flattened .",
    "spherical models can not reproduce the distribution of the a - type stars in our sample and are discrepant with the data at both bright and faint magnitudes .",
    "our best - fit models suggest that the stellar halo is oblate with a flattening ( or minor axis to major axis ratio ) of @xmath169 with a typical uncertainty of @xmath170 . as a simple representation of the stellar halo , we advocate the use of a broken power - law model with an inner slope @xmath171 and an outer slope @xmath172 , the break radius occurring at about 27 kpc .",
    "this gives the formula @xmath173 with @xmath174 .",
    "for those who prefer einasto models , an equally good law for the stellar halo density is @xmath175 \\right].\\ ] ] these two formulae are fundamental results of our paper , and can be summarised as the milky way stellar halo is _ squashed and broken_. the results are qualitatively similar to those obtained by sesar et al .",
    "( 2011 ) using main - sequence stars .",
    "there is no evidence in the data for variation of the flattening with radius .",
    "there is some mild evidence for a triaxial shape , but the apparent triaxiality might be due to the presence of the monocerus ring at low latitudes ( @xmath176 ) and regions of the southern sagittarius stream .",
    "the root - mean - square deviation of the data around the maximum likelihood model @xmath148 typically ranges between @xmath177 and @xmath165 .",
    "this indicates that the milky way stellar halo , or at least the component traced by the a - type stars in the sdss dr8 , is _ smooth _ and not dominated by unrelaxed substructure .",
    "this finding is discrepant with the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "these authors use main sequence turn - off stars selected from sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) to model the stellar halo density .",
    "they argue that no smooth model can describe the data and conclude that the stellar halo is dominated by substructure ( with @xmath178 ) .",
    "we suggest that these contrasting results may be due to the different methods and tracers used .",
    "@xcite search for the lowest @xmath148 fraction models .",
    "however , we find that the @xmath148 values very little between different density models even if the likelihood is substantially increased .",
    "furthermore , a lower @xmath148 could also indicate that a model is ` fitting ' to any substructure ( e.g. triaxial models both in this work and in @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also use main sequence stars as tracers which are more numerous than a - type stars , but are much poorer distance indicators .",
    "the adopted absolute magnitude scale for main sequence stars is dependent on metallicity and colour . @xcite",
    "assume a median absolute magnitude of @xmath179 with a scatter of @xmath180 ; an appropriate choice for a halo population with metallicity @xmath92 \\sim -1.5 $ ] .",
    "the scatter , even with an assumed metallicity , is greater than the spread in absolute magnitude for bs stars ( @xmath93 per colour bin ) .",
    "uncertainties in the distances to stars could lead to compact substructures becoming more blurred out over a wider range of distance .",
    "it is possible that @xcite see a somewhat younger and/or metal - richer component of the stellar halo with the main sequence tracers .",
    "this component could be more unrelaxed than the one traced by a type stars .",
    "our conclusion that the stellar halo is composed of a smooth underlying density , together with some additional substructures such as the virgo overdensity and the sagittarius stream , is very reassuring .",
    "if the stellar halo were merely a hotch - potch of tidal streams and unrelaxed substructures , then modelling and estimation of total mass and potential would be much more difficult .",
    "many of the commonly - used tools of stellar dynamics  such as the steady - state jeans equations ",
    "implicitly assume a well - mixed and smooth equilibrium .",
    "this raises the hope that a full understanding of the spatial and kinematic properties of stars in the smooth , yet squashed and broken , stellar halo can yield the gravitational potential and dark matter profile of the galaxy itself .",
