    "the known satellite galaxies of the milky way all lie within @xmath3 kpc and their brightest stars are resolvable from ground - based telescopes .",
    "so , it is possible to acquire an enormous wealth of data on their stellar populations , making the satellite galaxies important objects in many fields of astrophysics  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they have also emerged as a battle - ground in near - field cosmology  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental prediction of cold dark matter ( cdm ) theories is an abundance of substructure in the non - linear regime . as noted by @xcite and @xcite , galaxy assembly in cdm cosmogonies",
    "typically yields an order of magnitude more dark haloes than there were known satellites around the milky way .",
    "prior to the sloan digital sky survey  ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there were 9 widely - accepted milky way dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) , namely draco , ursa minor , fornax , carina , sculptor , leo i , leo ii , sextans and sagittarius .",
    "seven of the milky way dsphs were discovered by eye using photographic plates .",
    "the eighth , sextans , was found by @xcite as part of a search of automated scans of photographic plates , whilst the ninth , sagittarius , was first identified kinematically from radial velocity surveys of the galactic bulge  @xcite . the number of known milky way dsph satellites had been increasing at a rate of one or two per decade before the advent of sdss .",
    "the impact of sdss has been dramatic .",
    "four new milky way dsph satellites have been discovered in sdss data in quick succession : ursa major  @xcite , canes venatici  @xcite , botes  @xcite and ursa major ii  @xcite , together with what appears to be an unusually extended globular cluster  @xcite .",
    "none are apparent in sdss images , but all are very clearly identifiable as overdensities of resolved stellar objects .",
    "this paper presents a further five new satellites found in sdss data , one each in the constellations of coma berenices , canes venatici , hercules , and two in leo .",
    "we have confirmed four of these discoveries with follow - up photometry on the subaru telescope on mauna kea and the isaac newton telescope on la palma .",
    "this brings the total number of milky way companions found with sdss data to ten , eight of them probable dsphs .",
    "this roughly doubles the number known prior to sdss .",
    "they have eluded previous discovery because they are all of low surface brightness ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "in fact , recent years have seen the discovery of a number of objects that blur the hitherto clear distinction between star clusters and dwarf galaxies .",
    "these include the ultra compact dwarf galaxies in the fornax cluster  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the globular clusters with unusually large half - light radii in m31  @xcite and the faint dsphs around m31  @xcite . the 10 new sdss discoveries all lie in this poorly charted territory , where  in the absence of kinematic data  the distinction between star clusters and dwarf galaxies is hazy .",
    "the paper is organised as follows :  2 provides a summary of the sdss and follow - up photometry on our 5 new discoveries , together with a table of their properties .  3 reviews the relationship between globular clusters and dwarf galaxies in the light of our new data , and considers the implications of our discoveries for near - field cosmology .",

    "this nomenclature accords with historical precedent .",
    "the first row of figure  [ fig : objsa ] refers to a satellite in coma berenices ( henceforth com ) , the second to a satellite in canes venatici ( henceforth cvn ii ) , the third to a probable globular cluster ( henceforth segue 1 ) , the fourth to a satellite in hercules ( henceforth her ) and the fifth to a satellite in leo ( henceforth leo iv )  . for each object , the first column provides a grey - scale image centered on the satellite ; no obvious objects can be seen .",

    "deeper follow - up observations of com , cvn ii and segue 1 were made at the subaru telescope on mauna kea , using the suprime - cam mosaic camera .",
    "the data were gathered on 2006 may 25 ( ut ) , using a single pointing to cover each stellar overdensity . in each case , the location of the subaru field is shown in the panels in the first column of figure  [ fig : objsa ] . each pointing",

    "exposures comprised three dithered 600 second integrations in each of the @xmath65 and @xmath66 filters ( for a total of 30 minutes of exposure in each filter ) .",

    "the lower panels show the same physical quantity , but this time constructed with the deeper data from subaru / int . in these differential hess diagrams , familiar features , such as giant branches , horizontal branches and upper main sequences , can all be discerned .",
    "we conclude that each of the 4 objects is localized and has a distinct stellar population .",
    "this provides reassuring confirmation that these 4 objects are new satellites .    for the purpose of clarity ,",
    "the hess diagrams are converted to contour plots in figure  [ fig : objsc ] .",

    "the ridgeline of very old , metal poor m92 gives a remarkably good representation of the stellar populations . in the cases of com and segue 1 ,",
    "the main sequence and giant branch can be matched well . in the cases of cvn ii and her , the turn - off , giant branch and , most importantly , the horizontal branch are well - fit .",
    "this comparison immediately gives us a good estimate of the distance modulus to each object , as listed in table  [ tab : objs ] .",
    "segue 1 and com are reasonably close , at heliocentric distances of @xmath72 kpc and @xmath73 kpc , whilst cvn ii and her are further away at distances of @xmath74 kpc and @xmath75 kpc , respectively .",
    "to define membership of each object , we use the m92 ridgeline to construct a mask at the estimated distance .",
    "figure  [ fig : objsd ] shows the isodensity contours of stars matching the mask for each object using sdss and follow - up data .",
    "they are all extended and rather irregular in their outer parts .",
    "com is the closest and has the most substructure .",
    "cvn ii and her are rounder , but there is evidence for extensions that may be part of streams or tails .",
    "segue 1 is the smallest .",
    "its innermost contours are quite round , but there is clearly a tail visible in the sdss data .",
    "we have no follow - up data for leo iv .",
    "however , its cmd , shown in figure  [ fig : leo4 ] , reveals a giant branch and blue horizontal branch .",
    "as before , the ridgeline of m92 gives a reasonable match ( see middle panel of figure  [ fig : leo4 ] ) , but the width of the giant branch appears to be larger than that of a single stellar population .",
    "the isodensity contours are shown in the right panel .",
    "black dots indicate candidate blue horizontal branch stars .",
    "it is reassuring to see that they are concentrated and extended in the same manner as the isodensity contours . in the absence of follow - up data , we regard this as a useful check .",
    "a number of integrated photometric and morphological parameters for com , cvn ii , segue 1 , her and leo iv are reported in table  [ tab : objs ] .",
    "the algorithms for the calculations of position angle , ellipticity , half - light radius , and absolute magnitude are described in detail in our earlier papers  @xcite .      based on their sizes and shapes ,",
    "our working hypothesis is that com , cvn ii , her , and leo iv are new dwarf galaxies , whilst segue 1 is an extended globular cluster .",
    "_ com _ is located at a heliocentric distance of @xmath76 kpc .",
    "it has a half - light radius of @xmath77 pc , although this may be an underestimate given its irregular and extended shape .",
    "its cmd is consistent with that of a single , old stellar population of metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath78 .",
    "_ cvn ii _ is at a distance of @xmath79 kpc and has a half - light radius of @xmath75 pc .",
    "the central density contours are round , but there is a southward extension clearly visible in the deep subaru data .",
    "its cmd has a clearly defined subgiant branch with a hint of a red clump , a reasonably prominent blue horizontal branch and a narrow giant branch .",
    "_ segue 1 _ is the closest at a distance of @xmath80 kpc .",
    "its half - light radius is 30 pc , roughly the same size as the largest milky way globular clusters , such as pal 5 and pal 14  @xcite .",
    "there is evidence for tidal tails in the sdss data .",
    "its cmd has a poorly populated subgiant branch and no obvious horizontal branch . at @xmath81 ,",
    "segue 1 is superposed on the sagittarius stream ; at this location @xcite estimated the distance to the sagittarius stream to be @xmath82 kpc , close to the distance to segue 1 .",
    "we conclude that segue 1 is likely a globular cluster formerly associated with the sagittarius dsph .",
    "_ her _ lies at a distance of @xmath50 kpc and has a half - light radius of @xmath83 pc .",
    "it has an extended morphology .",
    "its cmd shows not just a giant branch , but both blue and red horizontal branches , which may hint at multiple stellar populations .",
    "_ leo iv _ is at a distance of @xmath51 kpc .",
    "its half - light radius is @xmath84 pc .",
    "its cmd is more complex than the others , with an apparent thick giant branch and a blue horizontal branch .",
    "the thickness may be caused by multiple stellar populations and/or by depth along the line of sight .",
    "the five objects in this paper , together with the five milky way satellites previously discovered in sdss data  namely ursa major i , willman 1 , canes venatici i , bootes and ursa major ii  can be usefully taken together as a group .",
    "they were all discovered in the same dataset with similar methods , although this does not necessarily imply any underlying physical commonality .",
    "the locations of the ten sdss objects in the galactic sky are shown in figure  [ fig : dwarfslb ] , together with the 9 previously known dsphs . prior to sdss",
    ", it had long been suspected that there may be some missing dsphs at low galactic latitude in the zone of avoidance  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the sdss objects all lie at high galactic latitude , as the survey is concentrated around the north galactic pole .",
    "it is difficult to escape the conclusion that there are many more milky way companions waiting to be discovered . assuming ( i ) all dwarf satellites in the area of sky covered by sdss have been found and ( ii ) the distribution of dwarf satellites is isotropic , then there may be @xmath85 dwarfs in all .",
    "in fact , both assumptions are surely incorrect .",
    "systematic surveys for all satellites in sdss dr5 are underway ( e.g. , koposov et al . 2006 , in preparation ) and will undoubtedly uncover further candidates .",
    "the spatial distribution of dwarf galaxies is a controversial issue , although the most recent analysis of the simulation data suggests that dwarf satellites may lie preferentially along the major axis of the light distribution of the host galaxy  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "if so , then our extrapolation to a total of @xmath86 dwarfs may still be a underestimate .",
    "figure  [ fig : magversusrh ] shows objects plotted in the plane of absolute magnitude and half - light radius .",
    "this includes the ten sdss discoveries in the milky way ( filled circles ) and the eight milky way dsphs omitting sgr ( unfilled circles ) .",
    "we have added to the sample of sdss discoveries two dsphs found around m31 , namely and ix and x  @xcite . also shown",
    "are a number of populations of extragalactic objects  such as the m31 dsphs , including the most recent 3 discoveries by  @xcite , the three unusually extended globular clusters found in m31 by  @xcite , the ultra - compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) in the fornax and virgo clusters  @xcite and globular clusters from the nearby giant elliptical ngc 5128  @xcite .",
    "some lines of constant surface brightness are also marked .",
    "this shows why the recent spate of discoveries in sdss data is occurring  the survey is reaching much lower surface brightnesses than possible before .",
    "all the sdss discoveries lie below , and all the previously known milky way dsphs above , the line marking @xmath87",
    ".    some properties of the sdss discoveries are apparent from figure  [ fig : magversusrh ] . as a group , they are much fainter than the previously known milky way and m31 dsphs .",
    "they are also less regular in shape , which suggests tidal effects may be important .",
    "of course , caution is needed , as some of the isophotal distortion is due to low object counts and uncertain background subtraction .",
    "nonetheless , there seems to be a rough correlation between irregularity and distance , as boo , uma ii and com are the most irregular and also amongst the closest .",
    "they all seem to be very metal - poor with [ fe / h ] @xmath88 , at least as judged by the fit of m92 s ridgeline to giant branch , main sequence turn - off or horizontal branch of the cmds .",
    "this is supported by the recent measurement of the metallicity of boo  @xcite as [ fe / h ] @xmath89 .",
    "the sdss discoveries are larger and somewhat less luminous than typical milky way globular clusters .",
    "the seeming lack of metals in the sdss discoveries is interesting .",
    "the galactic halo contains a significant fraction of stars more metal - poor than [ fe / h ] @xmath90  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the previously known dsphs on the other hand contain very few metal - poor stars  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the new sdss discoveries may be representatives of the population that built the old , metal - poor component of the milky way halo .    also apparent in figure",
    "[ fig : magversusrh ] is the fact that the data - points fall into a number of clumps .",
    "the milky way globulars form one obvious grouping . a number of unusual objects , such as the extended m31 clusters and the ucds in fornax and virgo , all lie in regions abutting the globulars in the plane of absolute magnitude and half - light radius .",
    "for example , ucds are brighter than galactic globulars , but they could be the bright tail of the globular cluster systems in the fornax and virgo clusters .",
    "separating the globulars from the dwarf galaxies is a sparsely populated vertical band corresponding to half - light radii between @xmath1 pc to @xmath2 pc .",
    "only two objects lie in this gap .",
    "the first is com , which is so irregular that its half - light radius is susceptible to significant uncertainties .",
    "the second is ucd3 in fornax as measured by @xcite .",
    "a _ hubble space telescope _",
    "re - measurement of the half - light radius of this object by @xcite yielded a somewhat smaller answer .",
    "the two measurements are connected by a straight line in figure  [ fig : magversusrh ] .",
    "the gap is suggestive , but not conclusive , as sdss dr5 covers only 20 per cent of the night sky around the north galactic cap .",
    "there are still very few objects in figure  [ fig : magversusrh ] at low surface brightness .",
    "however , it is significant that there are sdss discoveries on either side of the gap .",
    "it is also clear that , if there were a population of extended , luminous star clusters in the milky way analogous to those found by @xcite in m31 , then they would have very likely been found already in sdss data . in this picture ,",
    "segue 1 and willman 1 are unusually faint , extended , globular clusters , whilst the remaining sdss discoveries are dwarf galaxies",
    ". of course , the separation between clusters and dwarf galaxies would be much clearer on plots of absolute magnitude versus velocity dispersion .",
    "it will be interesting to see analogues of figure  [ fig : magversusrh ] once kinematic data become available .    at the moment , all objects to the left of the gap show no evidence of dynamically significant dark matter .",
    "all the objects to the right with measured kinematics are consistent with substantial amounts of dark matter . for the classical dsphs ,",
    "the kinematic data are consistent with a common halo mass scale  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is also the case for uma  i @xcite .",
    "if this holds for all the new sdss discoveries , it might provide a natural explanation for the existence of a gap .",
    "the objects discussed in this paper have a number of implications for near - field cosmology .",
    "in cdm , dark matter overdensities collapse to form cusped halos , with the smallest and least massive halos being the densest .",
    "the simulations of @xcite and @xcite predicted hundreds of small galactic satellite halos , as compared to the handful of then known satellite galaxies around the milky way .",
    "if each small dark matter halo indeed harbors a detectable small galaxy , then there is a dramatic conflict between predictions and observations .",
    "it remains unclear whether theory or observations are responsible for this discrepancy .",
    "in fact , many theoreticians responded to this result by developing models that suppress gas accretion  ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or star formation in low mass halos .",
    "this produces a large population of entirely dark satellites  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , together with a much smaller number of dsphs , roughly in accord with the datum of 9 dsphs per large galaxy .",
    "however , it is now clear , from the discoveries over the past couple of years , that the observational situation has changed dramatically .",
    "spectroscopic studies are urgently needed to assess the dark matter content of the sdss discoveries .",
    "so far , only two of the galaxies have kinematic data .",
    "@xcite measured the velocities of seven uma i stars and obtained a velocity dispersion of @xmath91 and a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath92 .",
    "@xcite measured the radial velocities of seven boo stars and obtained a velocity dispersion of @xmath93 and a mass - to - light ratio of between 130 and 680 .",
    "caution is needed in interpreting these results as they are calculated under the strong assumption of steady - state , virial equilibrium .",
    "based on these results , uma i and boo would be the two most dark matter dominated objects known in the universe .",
    "the implication is that the sdss discoveries may well be members of the missing population of low stellar mass , dark matter dominated galaxies originally predicted by cdm .",
    "only when a complete census of these objects has been obtained will we be able to assess whether the properties of the population are consistent with the predictions of the simulations .",
    "another possibility is that the milky way satellites condensed out of the tidal tails of an early merger with a gas - rich progenitor  @xcite ; this would make them analogous to the tidal dwarf galaxies observed in interacting systems today  @xcite .",
    "an attractive facet of this idea is that it naturally accounts for possible streams in the milky way dsphs .",
    "this phenomenon was originally spotted by  @xcite , who noted that the bright dsphs may be aligned in one or two streams of tidal debris .",
    "examining figure  [ fig : dwarfslb ] , it is apparent that the simple model of  @xcite , in which most of the milky way satellites are associated with a single disk - like structure , is hard to reconcile with the new data .",
    "@xcite has studied the long - time evolution of tidal dwarf galaxies .",
    "the idea is that tidal dwarf galaxies with no dark matter suffer destruction at perigalacticon passages to leave orbiting but unbound agglomerations of stars that appear compact near their apocenter , and which constitute some of the present - day dsphs .",
    "the absence of velocity gradients and the thinness of the horizontal branch in galaxies like draco  @xcite , fornax and sagittarius  @xcite means that this theory can not reproduce the observed properties of the brightest dsphs .",
    "however , the irregular shape and the abundance of substructure in the objects presented by @xcite do bear a striking resemblance to the new sdss discoveries , although kroupa s objects as a class are much more luminous and may require fortuitous timing and a favorable viewing angle .",
    "it would be interesting to see detailed predictions of the properties of these objects at fainter absolute magnitudes ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "in this paper , we announced the discovery of five new satellites of the milky way .",
    "one is a probable new globular cluster , which has been named segue 1 after the survey in which it was found .",
    "it is in the sagittarius stream and was possibly stripped off the sagittarius progenitor .",
    "the remaining four are probably new dwarf galaxies , which have been named according to their constellations as coma berenices , canes venatici ii , leo iv and hercules .",
    "we have presented sdss and deeper subaru / int photometry ( where available ) on these objects .",
    "we provide color - magnitude diagrams , distances , absolute magnitudes and half - light radii for all the satellites .    taken together with the earlier announcements of ursa major i , willman 1 , canes venatici i , bootes and ursa major ii , ten new milky way satellites have been discovered in sdss data in very rapid succession .",
    "this abundance of discoveries is occurring because the survey is probing down to hitherto uncharted surface brightnesses .",
    "all the sdss discoveries are effective surface brightness fainter than @xmath87 .",
    "the obvious conclusion is that there are more low surface brightness milky way satellites waiting to be discovered .",
    "the sdss discoveries occupy a distinct region in the plane of absolute magnitude versus half - light radius .",
    "they are typically fainter , more metal - poor and more irregular than the previously - known milky way dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) .",
    "they are larger , and somewhat less luminous , than typical galactic globular clusters . taking the known globular clusters , the previously known milky way satellites and the sdss discoveries , there is still a scarcity of objects with half - light radii between @xmath1 pc and @xmath2 pc .",
    "this may represent the division between star clusters and dwarf galaxies .",
    "the sdss discoveries could have a bearing on the `` missing satellite '' problem .",
    "preliminary indications from studies of uma i  @xcite and boo  @xcite suggest that these objects may be dark matter dominated .",
    "it seems possible that a population of ultra - faint , dark dwarf galaxies really does surround the milky way .",
    "however , it is not yet clear that these are the `` missing satellites '' predicted by the simulations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the match of the data to cdm halos should be carried out in the plane of cumulative number versus halo mass or circular velocity .",
    "kroupa s ( 1997 ) study of the evolution of tidal dwarf galaxies reproduces some of the properties of the new satellites .",
    "this opens up the possibility that some of these objects may be tidal dwarf galaxies , or shreds from the violent building phase of the milky way . in this case",
    ", the satellites will not have substantial dark matter .",
    "kinematic data are now urgently needed to confirm whether or not these objects are dark matter dominated .",

    "<S> we present five new satellites of the milky way discovered in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) imaging data , four of which were followed - up with either the subaru or the isaac newton telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> they include four probable new dwarf galaxies  one each in the constellations of coma berenices , canes venatici , leo and hercules  together with one unusually extended globular cluster , segue 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we provide distances , absolute magnitudes , half - light radii and color - magnitude diagrams for all five satellites . </S>",
    "<S> the morphological features of the color - magnitude diagrams are generally well described by the ridge line of the old , metal - poor globular cluster m92 . in the last two years </S>",
    "<S> , a total of ten new milky way satellites with effective surface brightness @xmath0 have been discovered in sdss data . </S>",
    "<S> they are less luminous , more irregular and appear to be more metal - poor than the previously - known nine milky way dwarf spheroidals . </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between these objects and other populations is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we note that there is a paucity of objects with half - light radii between @xmath1 pc and @xmath2 pc . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that this may represent the division between star clusters and dwarf galaxies . </S>"
