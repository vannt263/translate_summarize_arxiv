    "pulsed lasers , which are routinely used in spectroscopy , can have very high peak power .",
    "for example , the peak power of a 10 fs pulse with an energy of 1 nj is on the order of 100 kw .",
    "when such pulses are focused to a spot size of 10 @xmath4 m the peak intensity can reach @xmath5 100 gw/@xmath6 .",
    "interaction of pulses having such high intensity electric fields with a sample can generate a plethora of non - linear signals , which can be used to study various spectroscopic properties of the sample.@xcite it is usually cumbersome , and also unnecessary , to investigate all of the non - linear signals in an experiment .",
    "hence , different methods , such as phase matching , phase cycling and phase modulation , are often used to isolate the relevant signal contributions.@xcite    for an electric field described by a plane wave @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 is the temporal envelope of the field , the wave - vector @xmath9 and the frequency @xmath10 quantify the momentum and energy of the photons , respectively .",
    "conservation of energy and momentum in an @xmath11-wave mixing process@xcite leads to the generation of phase - matched non - linear signals with distinct wave - vectors @xmath12 and frequencies @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the wave - vectors and the frequencies of the @xmath16 incident field .",
    "phase - matching is used extensively to isolate specific field - matter interaction pathways in non - linear spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite for example , in a degenerate @xmath17-wave mixing ( dfwm ) experiment ,  @xcite when the frequencies of all of the beams are the same , one commonly changes the directions of the incoming beams ( noncollinear geometry ) to spatially isolate the signal of interest .",
    "although dfwm experiments provide a wealth of information on different resonant and non - resonant properties of matter , they can not be used to study isolated microscopic systems whose dimensions are smaller than the wavelength of the light ; the uncertainty in the momentum of the photons emanating from a microscopic object prohibits spatial separation of the different non - linear signals from each other and also from the excitation beams .",
    "this problem could be circumvented by using phase cycling schemes in optical spectroscopy,@xcite in analogy to multi - dimensional nmr spectroscopy.@xcite in a typical phase cycling scheme , the relative phases between the different laser pulses are controlled by using pulse shapers and a set of measurements are done at different relative phases ( i.e. , the relative phases in a single measurement are fixed ) .",
    "addition of the spectra acquired at the well defined set of relative phases selects the desired non - linear signal.@xcite the relative phases between the pulses can also be changed continuously ( dynamic phase cycling ) , as it is done in the technique of phase modulation,@xcite to separate the different signals arising from different field - matter interaction pathways .",
    "phase cycling and phase modulation techniques have mainly been used in optical two - dimensional action spectroscopy.@xcite in these experiments , one detects the action of four field - matter interactions on the incoherent signal , such as fluorescence@xcite or photocurrent.@xcite however , these techniques can be used more generally in isolating different coherent and incoherent signals arising from the non - linear interaction of the laser pulses with matter .",
    "motivated by the generality of the technique and its anticipated use in the spectroscopic investigation of isolated micro and nano - sized systems and devices , we present in detail the concepts and principles on the use of phase modulation in non - linear spectroscopy .",
    "similar principles can also be applied in experiments that use phase cycling .",
    "the polarization @xmath18 induced in a medium by an electromagnetic field @xmath19 can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the @xmath22 order susceptibility of the medium .",
    "although a propagating electric field has both spatial and temporal dependence , we ignore the spatial dependence in the following derivation in order to simplify the notation .",
    "this simplification is justified , as we use frequency rather than wavevector to separate the different non - linear signals in the phase modulation techniques .",
    "the total electric field due to a sequence of phase modulated pulses can be written as @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the modulation frequency of the @xmath26 pulse . in eq . , we have assumed that the amplitudes and the wavelengths of the different pulses ( before the phase modulation ) in the sequence are the same.@xcite in a typical experiment , we use acousto - optic modulators ( aoms ) to continuously sweep the relative phases of the optical fields .",
    "first - order diffraction from an aom simply shifts the frequency of the incident laser beam , i.e. @xmath27 . here @xmath28 is the frequency of the acoustic - wave in the aom .",
    "note that one can equivalently choose another first - order diffraction geometry with @xmath29 for all the beams to achieve the same results .",

    "shows that the polarization induced by @xmath11 laser fields oscillates with frequencies @xmath31 .",
    "it is possible to continuously sweep the optical phases by other means , such as reflection from a vibrating surface or an electro - optic modulator .",
    "however , such methods produce undesired sidebands at the multiples of the modulation frequency ; @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "as we demonstrate below , this complicates the separation of different contributions to the non - linear signal .",
    "we provide examples that include sum - frequency generation , two - photon fluorescence , and two photon photocurrent to illustrate how phase modulation can be used to separate the various signal contributions to nonlinear spectroscopic experiments .",

    "a pulsed laser beam is split into two beams , each of which passes through one of the arms of a mach - zehnder interferometer .",
