    "optical microscopy is a convenient tool to study biological processes , but its resolution is fundamentally limited by abbe s diffraction . the image of a point source is a pattern whose size is comparable to the optical wave - length ( @xmath3 ) , hence source points separated by a distance smaller than a wavelength are hardly distinguishable @xcite .",
    "electron microscopy provides a higher spatial resolution ( @xmath4 ) but at the cost of a more complex sample preparation which is incompatible with _ in vivo_-imaging @xcite .",
    "the recently developed super - resolution imaging techniques aim at combining the best of these two worlds . using these techniques , spatial resolution as low as @xmath5",
    "have been achieved for imaging biological cell structures . however , their applicability to the study of dynamical biological processes is limited by their long acquisition times @xcite .    though relying on different optical probes , the super - resolution techniques known as palm ( photoactivation localization microscopy ) or storm ( stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ) rely on a common principle : sources that lie within the same diffraction - limited volume",
    "are separated by a sequential activation process , which introduces a temporal separation between source points @xcite . within each frame ,",
    "a small and random fraction of probes is activated by illumination .",
    "this sparse subset of randomly activated probes is imaged to produce a frame . then , finding the centroid of each diffraction patterns leads to a set of coordinates , having a nanometer - level precision @xcite .",
    "merging all the single - molecule positions obtained on successive frames produces the final image . since only a small fraction of probes",
    "is imaged per frame , a certain number of frames is required in order to obtain a reliable image . multiplying this number by the typical acquisition time of frames ( typically in the @xmath6 range )",
    ", we obtain the minimal time , denoted @xmath7 , to obtain an image at a nanometer - scale resolution .",
    "a typical reported value is @xmath8 for a whole cell imaging at a @xmath9 resolution @xcite .",
    "this value is too large to study many dynamical processes that occur in living cells , such as the contraction of acto - myosin units @xcite , reorganization of focal adhesion complexes @xcite or protein cluster formation within the plasma membrane @xcite .",
    "efforts to reduce the acquisition time are hindered by the risk that the collected set of observations is incomplete .    in this article , we are interested in the risk of _ stochastic aberration _ in the final reconstructed image , whereby an incomplete observation would incorrectly suggest the presence of gaps within the structure .",
    "an illustrative example is the case of 1d structures , such as dna segments @xcite or actin filaments @xcite ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "suppose that the reconstructed super - resolved image contains a hole : how can we reliably discriminate whether this hole is a genuine gap in the structure rather than an aberration due to a lack of observations ?",
    "this question illustrates the interest of our model , which provides an estimate for the minimal number of observation frames required to minimize the risk of stochastic aberrations .",
    "it also highlights a major difference between stochastic and deterministic imaging techniques . with raster - scan - based techniques ,",
    "e.g. stimulated emission depletion ( sted ) , the resolution is exempt of stochastic aberration but the acquisition time @xmath10 increases linearly with the size of the field of view @xcite . with widefield stochastic techniques such as palm , the imaging time",
    "is thought to be independent of the size of the field of view .",
    "the density of the observed points , and concomitantly the final image resolution , increase with the acquisition time @xmath10 . image size ,",
    "density and total acquisition time are therefore essential parameters to assess the relevance and performance of widefield stochatic techniques .",
    "we briefly outline a simple reasoning that leads to the incorrect conclusion that the image completion time should be independent of the size of the field of view .",
    "we first suppose that fluorescent events are distributed according to a homogeneous poisson process , such that the probability density @xmath11 that an event occurs in an infinitesimal space of volume @xmath12 reads @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we now consider a regular domain of volume @xmath14 within a @xmath15 dimensional space , in which we assume a constant density of fluorophore @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that at each frame , only a fraction @xmath17 of fluorophores are detected .",
    "the number of detected fluorescence events after one frame , denoted @xmath18 , is a poisson process of density @xmath19 ; hence @xmath20 = \\exp(- \\rho { s } ) ( \\rho { s})^{n}/n!$ ] .",
    "if @xmath21 refers to the volume of the abel diffraction pattern , the mean number of fluorescence events per frame @xmath22 should be lower than @xmath0 in order to limit the risk of overlapping point spread functions .",
    "@xcite , hence @xmath24 . in the case of membrane ( @xmath25 ) with fluorophore density @xmath26",
    ", the corresponding maximal fraction of activated fluorophores should be @xmath27 .",
    "then , after a number @xmath7 of frames , the total number of collected events is distributed according to a poisson distribution , with @xmath28 = \\exp(- \\rho { s}t ) ( \\rho { s}t)^{n}/n!$ ] .",
    "this number of collected events determines the resolution of the reconstructed image , due to the nyquist criterion , which states that the mean distance between sampling points must be at least two - fold smaller than the desired resolution @xcite .",
    "therefore , to attain a resolution of @xmath29 , a minimal requirement is to collect at least @xmath30 evenly spaced observations per resolution volume @xmath31 , or , equivalently , to have at least @xmath0 observation per volume @xmath32 .",
    "as the density of detected fluorophores up to the time @xmath7 reads @xmath33 , the nyquist criterion leads to the identity @xmath34 , in order to guarantee that , on average , there has one observation per elementary volume @xmath35 . with @xmath32 and @xmath36 ,",
    "this leads to a minimal number of frames @xmath37 . in 2d and with a typical frame rate of @xmath38 ,",
    "the corresponding acquisition time would be of the order of a few minutes , independently of the size of the image .",
    "the relation @xmath39 also illustrates how recent imaging techniques achieved live - cell imaging at the cost of a lower spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "however , the condition @xmath34 does not imply that every elementary volumes have collected their one observation : some elementary volume may have collected several observations while most others none .    in this paper , we argue that , due to the randomness in the localization of events in stochastic widefield microscopy , the imaging time should not be considered independent of the size of the image .",
    "the uneven spatial distribution of events leads to a correction term @xmath40 in the expression of the imaging time .",
    "hence the main result of our article lies in the following relation : @xmath41 which means that the trade - off between the spatial ( @xmath35 ) and temporal ( @xmath7 ) resolutions is not only regulated by the density of activated fluorophores per frame @xmath42 , but also by the ratio of the size of the field of view @xmath14 by the desired spatial resolution , and by an additional parameter @xmath43 which characterizes the reliability of the final image . in many situations of interest",
    ", the prefactor @xmath40 can not be assumed to be close to @xmath0 .",
    "for example , a cell of extension @xmath44 contains @xmath45 squares of area @xmath46 ( ie . a typical size for an abel diffraction pattern ) .",
    "this corresponds to the ratio @xmath47 .",
    "any specific choice for the value of @xmath48 only increases the value of the acquisition time .",
    "hence our result predicts that the image completion time should be one order of magnitude longer than what would be expected from the arguments leading to expression in the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : main_message ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present the experimental setup that we use to test the validity of our theoretical expressions , in which we measure the light scattered by brownian nano - particles at the surface of a two - dimensional sample ( method  experiments ) .",
    "we then define two image rendering schemes ( method  image rendering ) .",
    "we then prove the relation eq .",
    "( [ eq : main_message ] ) , and we show its connexion to the coupon - collector problem @xcite .",
    "therefore , we refer to the result of eq . ( [ eq : main_message ] ) as the _ coupon - collector scaling_.    we then consider the robustness of the coupon - collector scaling for several requirement on the image completion .",
    "we first consider the effect of correlations between successive frames . this case",
    "is particularly motivated by our experimental setup , in which the escapes and returns of the brownian particles within the detection zone leads to temporally correlated scattering events between successive frames .",
    "we point out that there is a close analogy between our experiments and palm techniques in which the fluorophores blinking statistics exhibit time - correlations @xcite .",
    "we recall that bleaching refers to an irreversible transition of a probe to an inactive state , which can occurr following a fluorescence event @xcite .",
    "the analogy holds between blinking events , identified to light - scattering events from brownian particles , and bleaching events , identified to the escape events far from the illuminated region and with no ulterior return .",
    "we show that the coupon - collector scaling does not hold when a large number of coverage is required .",
    "we then compare our theoretical predictions to our experimental results .",
    "we conclude our article by presenting a procedure to estimate the risk of stochastic aberration , in real - time during the acquisition ( ie . at each frames during the image acquisition process ) .",
    "we briefly present the experimental data that we will use to test our predictions on the coverage time . in our recent work @xcite , we present a new stochastic imaging technique to map an electromagnetic field with a nano - scale resolution using light - scattering brownian particles as local probes of the intensity field .",
    "the brownian motion of the scatterers eventually lead to a full coverage of the imaged field .",
    "following @xcite , we consider the imaging problem of an evanescent wave created by a total internal reflection microscopy setup . in this setup",
    ", we consider that the optical intensity field can be modelled as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the penetration length of the field , and @xmath51 is proportional to the optical intensity of the field at the surface  with a proportionality constant related to the scattering cross section of the particles . in principle , in most situations , both quantities @xmath50 and @xmath51 can vary with the location @xmath52 on the surface . in this context , the term image acquisition refers to the determination of the fields @xmath51 and @xmath50 .",
    "however , as a first test of the method , we have considered in @xcite a situation in which @xmath51 and @xmath50 can be considered as homogeneous within the field of view .",
    "we detail a procedure that leads to the determination of @xmath51 and @xmath50 in the si , [ sec : app : justification ] .",
    "super - resolution techniques rely on the localization of the center of diffraction spots , which provides a set of points",
    ". however , a spatial extention needs to be attributed to each point to obtain an image that is readable to the human eye . in the following , we will be interested in the two following image rendering methods : ( i ) the bfm ( bfm ) , which is adapted to a density image representation @xcite and ( ii ) the patch method ( pm ) , which is associated to a pointillist representation @xcite .",
    "the bfm considers the structure of interest as tessellated into @xmath53 square pixels of equal area , which can therefore be expressed as the ratio of the total volume by the resolution volume : @xmath54 .",
    "each new event falls within a specific pixel , thereby increasing by one the cumulative number of observations of this pixel .",
    "this method is naturally adapted to measure the densities .",
    "though we employ the term pixel in the following , our method also applies to 3d imaging problems in which @xmath53 refers to the number of voxels within the structure of interest @xcite .    in the other hand , the pm associates to each event a surrounding extension , characterized by the quantity @xmath35 , which is either a length ( 1d ) , an area ( 2d ) or a volume ( 3d ) .",
    "generally , the spatial extension is chosen to correspond to the spatial uncertainty associated to the localization procedure ( e.g. a few nanometers , @xcite ) .",
    "the image completion time is related to the minimal number of patches required to cover the structure of interest .      as discussed in the introduction , we consider that the number of events occurring on each frame follows a poisson statistics , with a mean @xmath55 , where @xmath14 is the volume of the region of interest , and @xmath42 is the density of events per frame .",
    "we consider that the density of events @xmath42 ( i ) is homogeneous within the volume of the structure of interest ( ii ) is time - independent .    concerning the homogeneous assumption , we point out that , in most cases of interest , the field of view can not be considered as homogeneous",
    ". indeed , the field of view generally contains regions where no events should occurr .",
    "for example , consider the localization problem of actin filaments within a biological cell by palm .",
    "points which are located outside of the actin filaments should not yield any observation .",
    "we assume that there is a one to one correspondence between pixels which contain fluorophores and pixels within the structure .",
    "this amounts to neglecting the background noise , ie .",
    "spurious detection events in regions where fluorophores should not be present .",
    "hence , we are interested in the imaging process of a subset of the field of view , which we call the structure of interest .",
    "similarly , in the context of the experimental application of our method with brownian nanoparticles , we expect that only a subset of the field of view is relevant , as characterized by significantly higher intensity fields .",
    "this corresponds to the experimentally relevant cases of either structured @xcite or rough @xcite metallic surfaces , which can exhibit local hotspots whereby the incident light is concentrated on the nanometre scale to produce an intense electromagnetic field .",
    "this is particularly justified as we expect the probability to observe a particle to be a function of both @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in both experimental contexts ,",
    "we assume that the event probability follows a homogeneous poisson process within the volume of the structure of interest    in palm , the time - independent assumption can be questionned due to bleaching events @xcite . however , these bleaching events have no effect on the image completion time neither in the pm representation , nor in the bfm configuration with @xmath56 . in the bfm with @xmath57 ,",
    "the time - independent assumption is justified if the number of the remaining unbleached fluorophores per pixel is sufficiently large .",
    "we emphasize that , in most situations , the volume of the structure is unknown _ a priori_. within the bfm , we show in the si [ sec : app : festimator ] that the maximum likelihood estimator of the number of relevant pixels @xmath53 corresponds to the quantity : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the cumulative number of measures of the pixel @xmath60 , e.g. @xmath61 if the pixel @xmath60 has never collected any event up to time @xmath10 and @xmath62 if the pixel has been observed at least once up to time @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "similarly , within the patch - method framework , the maximum likelihood estimator of the structure volume consists in the covered volume at the time @xmath10 .",
    "these two estimators are biased , as they tend to underestimate the structure volume .",
    "that is proportional to the uncertainty of the super - localization procedure ( blue disk ) .",
    "( b ) patches accumulate with the acquisition time , eventually covering the whole structure of interest ( patches are represented by different colors patches for separate frames ) .",
    "( c  f ) box - filling representation , which leads to a density map in terms of a number of accumulated events per pixel .",
    "( c ) the field of view is divided into @xmath63 pixels among which @xmath64 pixels contain probes .",

    "( f ) map of the cumulative number of observations @xmath59 , for each @xmath60 and for each frame @xmath10 .",
    "complete image completion ( with @xmath65 ) is obtained after @xmath66 frames . at @xmath67 ,",
    "all pixels have been observed at least @xmath68 times .",
    ", height=302 ]      we call _ image completion time _ the minimal number of frames required to obtain a _",
    "complete _ image of the structure of interest .",
    "the term complete refers to the condition that every pixel or point ( among those that should be observed ) has been covered at least a certain number of times , denoted @xmath69 .",
    "more precisely , the image completion time @xmath7 is the random variable ( called stopping time ) that corresponds to the minimal time @xmath10 such that @xmath70 ; where @xmath71 $ ] in the bfm framework , or @xmath60 refers to any point within the volume of interest in the pm framework",
    ". we will be mainly interested in the centile of @xmath7 , denoted @xmath72 and defined as : @xmath73 = \\mathbb{p}\\left[\\min_{j}\\left(m^{(t_\\theta)}_j\\right ) \\geq r \\right ] = 1-\\theta,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the tolerated risk tolerance level .",
    "to summarize , the quantity @xmath74 refers to the minimal number of frames that guarantees , with @xmath75 probability , that the image is complete .",
    "both in the bfm and pm frameworks , the volume of the structure of interest is tessellated into a grid of elementary squares . in the bfm , each events covers a single elementary square ; while in the pm , each patches @xmath35 covers a square matrix of elementary squares . in both frameworks ,",
    "we generate a large sample of coverage events , and analyse the distribution of coverage times using matlab s _ prctile _ function .",
    "we first derive the main result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : main_message ] ) in the case of the bfm with no time - correlation between frames .",
    "we first suppose that @xmath53 and probability @xmath76 are known quantities . under the assumption that detection events occurring in separate pixels are independent , the probability that exactly @xmath77 pixels have been observed at least once ( @xmath65 ) reads : @xmath78 = { { f}\\choose m }   p_0^{(m-{f})t } \\left(1-p_0^{t}\\right)^{m},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 , and @xmath80 is the probability that an event occurs in a given pixel and at a given frame .",
    "equivalently , we can express this probability as @xmath81 .",
    "in particular , we conclude that the probability that the estimator @xmath82 is equal to its target value @xmath53 is equal to : @xmath83 = \\left(1-(1- p_1)^{t}\\right)^{{f}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as expected , the value of the probability in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ftheta ] ) converges to @xmath0 with time ( see fig . [",
    "fig5]c ) .",
    "we now determine the centile of the image completion time , defined according to eq .",

    "the latter expression corresponds to the announced expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : main_message ] ) .",
    "the key feature of eq . ( [ eq : t0_1 ] ) is the non - linear dependence of the imaging time in terms of the number @xmath53 of pixels that characterize the structure .",
    "this scaling is related to the classical coupon - collector problem @xcite .",
    "the problem consists in buying a minimal number of the boxes ( each containing a random coupon ) in order to gather a complete collection of coupons , with a sufficiently high probability . here",
    ", we focus on the case where each box contains , at random , either @xmath89 ( with probability @xmath90 ) or @xmath0 coupon  in which case the mean number of coupons per box is equal to @xmath91 .",
    "a straightforward proof leads to the following exact expression for the mean number of bought boxes @xmath10",
    "( i.e. frames ) required to collect all coupons ( i.e. all pixels ) is @xmath92 = { f}(1 + 1/2 + \\ldots + 1 /{f})/\\mu$ ] . if the number of coupons @xmath53 is large , the latter expression takes the asymptotic form @xmath92 =   { f}\\ln({f})/\\mu$ ] . adapting the identity ( 2 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , one shows that the centile of the stopping time reads @xmath93 in the same limit @xmath94 , which corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ftheta ] ) after identification of the mean number of coupons per box to the mean number of events per frame .",
    "the coupon - collector analogy also highlights the fact that the number of frames required to gather the very last remaining pixel is very long , as it scales linearly with the total number of pixels @xmath94 .",
    "mind that eq .",
    "( [ eq : t0_1 ] ) weakly depends on the risk level @xmath48 , which is another characteristic property of the coupon - collector problem @xcite .",
    "a heuristic justification is that , the stopping times distribution shrinks to its mean as the number of pixels @xmath53 is increased .",
    "furthermore , the image completion time does not depend on the number of pixels , but not on the 1d , 2d or 3d nature of the structure .",
    "this is expected since pixels are considered to be independent .    finally , we present a heuristic justification for the coupon - collector scaling , based on the evolution of the mean number of observed pixels . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : subset ] ) , one easily finds that the mean number of observed pixels reads @xmath95 , which , in the limit @xmath96 , becomes @xmath97 .",
    "we then notice that the time needed for the number of observed pixels to be @xmath98 follows the coupon - collector scaling of eq .",
    "( [ eq : t0_1 ] ) .",
    "we show that the coupon - collector scaling holds if the image completion is reached when every pixels have accumulated at least a number @xmath57 of observations .",
    "we show in the si [ sec : one_per_frame ] that , in this case , the centile of the image completion time reads @xmath99 this relation corresponds to the centile of the coupon collector s problem when @xmath100 copies of each coupon need to be collected ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize that eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcc2 ] ) requires that the number of coverage is sufficiently small , ie .",
    "that @xmath101 .",
    "we also generalize the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcc2 ] ) to a multi - color imaging problem ( see si [ app : sec : multicolor ] ) .",
