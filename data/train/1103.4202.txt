    "the experimental realization of a gas of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice @xcite has provided a unique opportunity to exploit a remarkably close connection between experimental and theoretical studies of interacting bose condensed systems . in one sense",
    ", one may think of the experiments as constituting a  quantum simulator \" of strongly interacting particles on a lattice @xcite described by the hubbard model @xcite . with the subsequent addition of speckle - generated disorder @xcite to these experiments , or by the generation of multichromatic lattices @xcite",
    ", a window into the world of strongly interacting disordered physics was opened .    the seminal paper of fisher , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , in 1989 predates the production of bose - condensed ",
    "cold \" atomic gases by several years .",
    "the focus of that paper is the disordered bose - hubbard model , including the thermodynamically stable quantum phases , the properties of these phases , and the transitions between them .",
    "many theory papers have followed since this work , the number of such papers is growing ( nearly ) exponentially since the realization of this model via cold atom experiments .",
    "one of the simplest and most often employed methods to analyze a model such as the disordered bose - hubbard model is mean - field theory .",
    "the paper of fisher , _",
    "@xcite , used such a theory to provide the first qualitative phase diagram of this system .",
    "many mean - field theory investigations , some of which we now mention , have followed this paper .",
    "our contribution , presented in this report , is the application of a so - called multi - site mean - field theory to investigate some of the same questions addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the ultimate goal of making comparisons between such a theory and experiment .",
    "as we outline below , the hoped - for improvement of such a multi - site theory is the incorporation of some spatial correlations that are neglected in conventional single - site site - decoupled mean - field analyses .",
    "as stated above , the present work is an example of a multi - site mean - field theory , and to put this approach into perspective it is important to first discuss the set of results found from the familiar site - decoupled single - site mean - field theory .",
    "the original paper of fisher , _",
    "@xcite , provided the qualitative aspects of the phase boundaries separating the relevant quantum phases , namely the mott insulating , bose glass , and superfluid phases . some time ago , using an rpa - based approach , this phase diagram was obtained quantitatively @xcite .",
    "following the many experimental advances discussed above , this theory was re - examined by several groups .",
    "we mention first the spatially - averaged single - site mean - field theory of krutitsky , _ et al .",
    "as discussed in the next section , this formulation allows one to obtain the phase boundaries analytically .",
    "however , since one is treating each site as being equivalent to all other sites , the resulting theory does not include any of the effects of coherent back - scattering that give rise to localized states , and correlations between the order parameter at neighbouring sites are completely ignored ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : phiiphij ] ) below ) .",
    "this limitation may be overcome by allowing for a different order parameter at every site , something that was achieved in a series of detailed papers ( below we refer specifically to only three papers in this series , refs .",
    "@xcite , since these are most relevant for comparisons to our results ) .",
    "these latter authors mapped one aspect of the problem onto an effective non - interacting anderson localization problem @xcite , and thereby found a simple analytical device to obtain ( numerically ) the mott insulator - bose glass phase very accurately , albeit within single - site theory .",
    "then , to obtain the bose glass - to - superfluid transition they analyzed the superfluid stiffness",
    ". they distinguished the bose glass phase from that of the superfluid by stating that the condensate fraction , @xmath0 , is non - zero in both of these phases , while the superfluid stiffness is non - zero only in the superfluid region .",
    "however , unlike the enormous lattices that were used by these authors to obtain the mott insulator - to - bose glass transition lines , when examining the bose glass and superfluid phases one must solve a set of self consistency equations for each site on a lattice , and this limits the sizes of the systems that can be studied .",
    "therefore , one is faced with the difficulties of completing calculations for many lattice sizes , thereby allowing for a finite - size scaling analysis to be completed .",
    "also , one must average over many different complexions of disorder . unlike the statements in their paper @xcite , when we completed comparative single - site numerics in the bose glass and superfluid phases , we found considerable finite size effects , as well as substantial variations with differing complexions of disorder .",
    "as we discuss below , a proposal exists that could explain this behaviour .",
    "the potential pitfalls of finite - size scaling and averages over complexions of disorder are avoided in the very elegant and creative theory of bissbort and hofstatter , so - called stochastic mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "these authors have found that for ( and , so far , only for ) single - site mean - field theory one may perform exactly ( albeit numerically ) the averaging over different complexions of disorder in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "unfortunately , as discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , the stochastic mean - field theory method is one that can only examine the thermodynamic limit .",
    "these authors argue , in direct contrast to the work of refs .",
    "@xcite , that the condensate fraction in the bose glass phase is identically zero , a result intimately tied to the existence of rare lifshitz regions .",
    "part of the motivation for our work is a comparison to the finite systems studied experimentally , for example the observed bose glass phase in three dimensions @xcite , as it is important to be able to understand large but finite systems .",
    "we have completed large - scale numerical studies of both the single - site approach of refs .",
    "@xcite as well as the stochastic mean - field theory of refs .",
    "@xcite , and have found differences between these theories .",
    "therefore , this provided further motivation to go beyond single - site theory to see if the correct physics could be identified .",
    "there is also a comparison of the single - site mean - field theory with quantum monte carlo studies available in the literature @xcite . comparing both position and momentum distributions of particles ( including the presence of a harmonic trapping potential ) , it has been shown that for a three dimensional bose - hubbard model the mean - field approximation results closely resemble the exact solution when the superfluid fraction is non - zero .",
    "it is suggested that the lack of particle - particle correlations in the single - site formulation of the mean - field theory is a deficiency that seems to affect primarily mott insulator and bose glass phases .",
    "the idea of extending single - site theories to multiple sites , or clusters , is not , of course , original . in a sense",
    "the same idea has been used , _ e.g. _ , when the very successful dmft ( dynamical mean - field theory ) @xcite was broadened to cellular or extended dmft @xcite .",
    "that is , such work represents an attempt to include more spatial correlations into a theory that ignores the wave - vector dependence of the self - energy .",
    "the same cluster extension has also been adapted to dmft for disordered systems  see the paper of potthoff and balzar @xcite in which the luttinger self - energy functional expansion technique is employed .",
    "also , a similar idea was applied to the diatomic bose - hubbard model , as we outline below .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of such effects is a natural extrapolation from site - decoupled mean - field theories that have been applied in other circumstances before .",
    "so , as discussed , the familiar limitations of mean - field theory apply to site - decoupled mean - field theory , notably the absence of spatial correlations .",
    "for example , for the bose - hubbard model one ca nt calculate pair correlations of the order parameter at differing sites as this corresponds to simply the one - body density matrix .",
    "our contribution is the extension of site - decoupled mean - field theory for the disordered bose - hubbard model to a cluster , or equivalently multi - site mean - field theory .",
    "our theory treats exactly the spatial correlations on each cluster ( each cluster has open boundary conditions ) , thereby giving us access to spatial correlations over length scales up to the largest distances spanning a cluster .",
    "in one dimension this allows for us to have clusters up to a size of six ( eight for homogeneous lattices ) , whereas for two dimensions even though one can examine clusters up to a size of 3@xmath13 for homogeneous clusters",
    "@xcite , for spatially disordered systems we were required to work with clusters of size 2@xmath12 , although one can also work with clusters of 3@xmath12 sites using the technique of basis truncation @xcite , which is described later in this paper . like the site - decoupled single - site mean - field theory discussed above , in our multi - site work for disordered systems",
    "we also allow for a different ( self - consistent ) order parameter at every site in the lattice .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the formalism associated with multi - site mean - field theory",
    "applied to the disordered bose - hubbard model . in this section",
    "we also include the formal details associated with the spatially - averaged variant of multi - site mean - field theory , a natural extension of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following section we present our numerical results of applying this theory to the two - dimensional disordered bose - hubbard model , including an extrapolation of the spatially - averaged variant of single - site mean - field theory of ref .",
    "@xcite to a multi - site formulation .",
    "this is followed in the last section by a discussion of our results , their relation to previously published data , and further extensions that are possible with this theory .",
    "the hamiltonian under study is the disordered bose - hubbard model , which is defined ( in the grand canonical ensemble ) as @xmath2 where @xmath3 label the sites of the optical lattice , @xmath4 and @xmath5 annihilate and create a boson on site @xmath6 , respectively , @xmath7 denotes that @xmath6 and @xmath8 are nearest neighbours , and the number operator for site @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "the near - neighbour hopping frequency is denoted by @xmath10 , and all hopping beyond nearest neighbours is suppressed .",
    "the on - site ( hubbard ) interaction energy is denoted by @xmath11 , and consistent with recent experiments @xcite , interactions between bosons on different sites are considered to be small and are ignored .",
    "the disorder is introduced into the model considered here via the on - site energies @xmath12 , and we focus on a uniform distribution of energies from the range of @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath15 controls boson number . in",
    "what follows below , we restrict our considerations to zero temperature .",
    "our work examines the application of a multi - site mean - field theory to this model . to understand the differences with the familiar and oft - employed site - decoupling mean - field theory ( _ e.g. _ , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , note that this latter approximation can be derived by writing @xmath16 with @xmath17 representing the ground state , and the ( spatially homogeneous ) superfluid order parameter being denoted by @xmath18 . then , ignoring terms in the hopping hamiltonian that are second order in @xmath19 , the resulting model hamiltonian ( denoting site - decoupling by @xmath20 ) for a homogeneous lattice , where all @xmath21 and therefore the order parameter is independent of lattice site , namely @xmath22 , is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the coordination number for the lattice under consideration .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : dbh - sitedecoupling ] ) makes clear that this formulation leads to a sum over single - site hamiltonians .",
    "further , this means that the form of the ground - state wave function is @xmath26 is zero everywhere )",
    ". then one must generalize eq .",
    "( [ eq : dbh - sitedecoupling - sitei ] ) to be @xmath27 where the last sum is over @xmath28 a sum over all sites within one near - neighbour distance to site @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , one again obtains a hamiltonian that is site decoupled ( @xmath29 depends on creation and annihilation operators only for site @xmath6 ) , and a ground - state wave function of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi - as - product ] ) .",
    "however , such a formulation does include spatial correlations in the sense that for a given complexion of disorder ( that is , for a given set of on - site energies @xmath12 ) , one must solve the self consistency equation at every site .",
    "that is , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi - as - product ] ) the site - dependent order parameter is found from @xmath30 and as is seen from eq .",
    "( 6 ) , the ground state of each @xmath29 depends on the order parameters on neighbouring sites .",
    "last , we note the well - known result @xcite that the minimum value of the grand potential ( at @xmath31 ) @xmath32 is achieved when the self - consistency conditions given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi - i - sc ] ) are satisfied .",
    "the multi - site version of mean - field theory for the homogeneous bose - hubbard model has been stated previously in the literature @xcite , and these authors used this formulation to examine a one - dimensional diatomic lattice .",
    "they obtained data by analyzing one diatomic  cluster \" and examined the stability of so - called loop - hole phases . in a subsequent paper",
    "these authors stated that the convergence with cluster size ( see below ) was poor , and therefore preferred to examine their problems using different approaches .",
    "the work of mcintosh , zaremba and one of the present authors @xcite showed how one obtains improved phase boundaries when one uses a multi - site formulation , in particular when examining two and three - dimensional lattices .",
    "further , in the analysis of the one - dimensional diatomic lattice the stability conditions on various  loop - hole \" , or  fractional lobe \" , phases and mass - density wave states were seen to be changed when more than one diatomic cluster was considered .",
    "below we discuss the extrapolation of these ideas to disordered systems .",
    "the simplest derivation of this formulation can be given in one dimension , and for clarity we detail this formalism for such situations . consider a one - dimensional chain with @xmath33 lattice sites , the sites being labelled by @xmath34 , with periodic boundary conditions . let the chain be decomposed into @xmath35 clusters with @xmath36 sites per cluster , and @xmath37 . label the clusters by @xmath38 , and note that any given lattice site can now be indexed by @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "then , write the ( exact ) grand hamiltonian as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 \\nonumber \\\\ -t&\\sum_{\\ell=0,\\dots , l-2 } & \\left ( \\hat{a}^\\dagger_{\\ell+il } \\hat{a}_{\\ell+1+il } + \\hat{a}^\\dagger_{\\ell+1+il } \\hat{a}_{\\ell+il } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each @xmath42 is the exact grand hamiltonian for a cluster of length @xmath36 with open boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , one should think of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dbh-1dclusters ] ) as representing a sum of single - cluster hamiltonians ( @xmath42 ) that are then coupled via hopping terms between the near - neighbour clusters ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "one can think of the inter - cluster interactions as being perturbations on the sum over cluster hamiltonians .",
    "the idea behind the multi - site mean - field approximation is to apply mean - field decouplings to the inter - cluster hopping terms , @xmath44 .",
    "that is , applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfdecoupling ] ) only to these terms , and denoting the order parameters at each end of the cluster by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 or @xmath47 for the left and right ends of the cluster , one finds that the multi - site mean - field approximation ( denoted by the superscript @xmath48 ) for the inter - cluster interaction term is given by @xmath49\\ ] ] then , the multi - site mean - field hamiltonian is seen to be given by @xmath50    the main difference between the site - decoupled and multi - site mean - field theories will be made clear below . for now , simply note the differing forms of the ground - state wave functions .",
    "for the site - decoupled formulation one obtains the form shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi - as - product ] ) , whereas for the multi - site formulation one has @xmath51 is an energy eigenstate of the cluster hamiltonian @xmath42 . that is",
    ", the eigenstates of @xmath42 include the spatial correlations present in a fully interacting cluster of length @xmath36 with open boundary conditions , and specifically one sees that these eigenstates depend on the hopping parameter , @xmath10 .",
    "if instead one treats the hopping as a perturbation in the site - decoupled formulation , the unperturbed eigenstates do not depend on the hopping frequency .",
    "this begs the question , does the inclusion of some effects of hopping into the zeroth - order eigenvectors lead to more accurate estimates of the phase boundaries and quantum phases ? this was , in part , our motivation for this study .",
    "the geometry associated with the generalization of this idea to higher dimensions , and in particular to the focus of this paper , namely the two - dimensional square lattice , is straightforward ",
    "the site and cluster labels are now vectors , and an example partitioning of the lattice is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster ] .",
    "the only technical complication is that every site on the  edge \" of a cluster has its own order parameter , and for a disordered system all such order parameters are , in general , different .",
    "an important difference is seen immediately  the zeroth - order cluster hamiltonian for a site - decoupled theory does not depend on the hopping frequency , @xmath10 , and does not include any spatial correlations between the ( disordered ) on - site energies .     a portion of a two - dimensional square lattice that is partitioned into 2@xmath12 clusters  only the central cluster is shown in its entirety .",
    "the dashed lines show the division of the lattice into such clusters . in each cluster",
    "there are four sites , labelled by * a , b , c , d * , and each cluster is denoted by a subscript , which runs from 1 to 9 . ]",
    "the form of the cluster states that are eigenvectors of @xmath42 can be written as @xmath52 and numerically one must choose some finite @xmath53 that leads to fully converged results .",
    "we have found that for the region of the phase diagram associated with the first mott lobe , namely @xmath54 , @xmath55 is sufficient when @xmath56  all of our results shown in this paper are within this range .",
    "the dimensionality of the hilbert space grows very rapidly with increasing cluster size and so does the computational time .",
    "therefore , in order to go beyond clusters of 2@xmath12 sites , one needs to reduce ( truncate ) the number of basis states even further .",
    "the challenge is to decide which states are important and should be retained and which can be discarded .",
    "of course , one still wants the results to be converged . following the work of schmitt , _",
    "@xcite we have adopted a truncation scheme which allows for a physically motivated and controlled approach that discards those states which contribute the least to the particular cluster s ground state . as a simple measure for the importance of individual number states one can use the expectation value of the hamiltonian .",
    "the key idea is to discard only those basis states for which the expectation value of the hamiltonian is greater than some value .",
    "those states have a considerably smaller contribution to the final ground state of a particular cluster , and this procedure leaves us with a given percentage of the initial basis set .",
    "we found that for clusters of 3@xmath12 sites it is enough to retain only 30% of the  full \" basis set ,  full \" corresponding to @xmath55 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : basisset ] ) ( as discussed in the previous paragraph ) . having in mind that the truncation scheme works well @xcite in the regions where the ground state is composed of few dominant basis states",
    ", one has to remember that the results for the superfluid phase will be less reliable .",
    "( one needs the full real space basis set to accurately describe the superfluid phase , since it is a phenomenon observed in the momentum space . )",
    "we will work in the strong - coupling limit in that we assume that @xmath11 is the largest energy scale , and instead of working with @xmath57 and its mean - field variants we work with the dimensionless @xmath58 and also express the various material parameters as scaled energies , namely @xmath59 letting the ( scaled ) energy @xmath60 characterize the strength of the disorder , the phase diagram for this model can be obtained in @xmath61 space . to begin",
    ", we present a brief discussion of the phases that appear in such phase diagrams .    for a homogeneous lattice with only near - neighbour hopping and on - site repulsion",
    ", one finds that mott insulating phases are found to correspond to an integral number of bosons per site . the superfluid phase is then found in the @xmath62 plane to correspond to @xmath63 . for non - homogeneous lattices the situation is more complicated . specifically , when @xmath64 one finds that the mott insulator phase is an incompressible phase that corresponds to integral densities of bosons per lattice site .",
    "for ordered non - homogeneous lattices , for example for a diatomic lattice in one dimension , one finds a variety of density - wave phases @xcite , ( so that the average density per site is integral , but the local bosonic densities need not be integral ) that are also incompressible and therefore mott insulators .",
    "in addition to such behaviour , even for binary disorder one finds mott insulating phases but now of a different nature @xcite ; these incompressible phases do not even have an average boson density per site that is integral .",
    "our analysis focuses on non - homogeneous lattices with a disorder that is not binary ( from now on in our discussion it is implicit that we are not addressing the situation of binary disorder ) , and the transition to non - mott insulating phases is qualitatively different .    formally , one notes that the exact grand hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dbh ] ) commutes with the total number operator , and therefore in the absence of degeneracies or symmetry - breaking terms being added to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dbh ] ) , the eigenstates are also number eigenstates . for systems with spatially disordered on - site energies , @xmath65 ,",
    "this is also true of both the site - decoupled ( eq .  ( [ eq : dbh - sitedecoupling ] ) ) and multi - site ( eq .  ( [ eq : dbh - msmft ] ) )",
    "mean - field hamiltonians when the order parameters @xmath45 are zero on _ all _ sites .",
    "however , when the mean - field terms are included they act as a source of symmetry - breaking interactions , and now the ground state is found to not correspond to number eigenstates ( either for a single site or for a multi - site ground states ",
    "see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : psi - as - product],[eq : psi - as - cluster - product ] ) ) . therefore , the resulting phases are compressible . also , as seen from eq .",
    "( 8) , in such a situation one obtains self - consistent solutions for which @xmath66 .    for a homogeneous lattice",
    "the compressible phase is known to be a superfluid . however ,",
    "for spatially disordered systems it is known that between the mott insulating and superfluid phases a new quantum state arises , a phase called the bose glass phase .",
    "several important results concerning this transition were summarized in the introduction to this paper . here",
    "we present the methodology that we have employed to determine the phase boundary separating the mott insulating and bose glass phases in @xmath61 space .    to identify the phase boundary of the mott insulating and superfluid phases for",
    "the homogeneous system one may use a variety of methods .",
    "for example , one may use perturbation theory @xcite on a landau - type expansion of the grand potential @xmath67 in the order parameter @xmath18 .",
    "simply , when the coefficient of the @xmath68 term is found to change from being positive to negative ( for say constant @xmath69 with increasing @xmath70 ) , the order parameter becoming non - zero signifies a continuous phase transition from the mott insulator to superfluid phases .",
    "this is the method that mcintosh , zaremba and one of us have used @xcite in analyzing various ordered systems .",
    "a variant of this approach has been used for disordered systems by treating the site - decoupled mean - field theory with a spatial average over disorder @xcite . to be concrete , _ if _ one approximates the order parameter to be spatially homogeneous for the disordered system , namely @xmath71 , and ignores the correlations between neighbouring sites , so that @xmath72 , then using the same approach as for a homogeneous system ( for a given distribution of on - site energies ) in a site - decoupled mean - field approximation one may derive @xcite ( in fact , analytically ) the loss of stability of the mott insulating phase with increasing disorder .",
    "below we explain how this approach can be extended to our multi - site mean - field formulation ; such results serve as the most simplistic approach in using our formalism to determine the locations of the phase boundaries .",
    "the approach that utilizes the full spatial structure of the on - site energies and order parameters that we have used can be explained as follows .",
    "again for clarity , consider a one - dimensional lattice with @xmath36 sites per cluster .",
    "for a given complexion of disorder any lattice will have different values of the order parameter at every site ( outside of the @xmath64 mott insulator region ) .",
    "then the phase boundary in such an approach can be derived by consideration of a stability matrix .",
    "that is , beginning with @xmath73 where ( for simplicity with the notation , restricting our attention to one - dimensional chains ) @xmath74\\ ] ] then , representing the decoupled ( that is , @xmath75 ) eigenstates via @xmath76 with all eigenstates of eq .",

    "however , for the disordered bose - hubbard model one finds an intervening bose glass phase .",
    "as is well known @xcite , the appearance of the condensate in an interacting system may be identified by a non - zero condensate fraction , denoted by @xmath0 , which may be evaluated based on the largest eigenvalue of the one - body density matrix in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this latter quantity is defined as follows .",
    "first , let @xmath87 denote the total number of bosons , namely @xmath88 then , the one - body density matrix may be defined by @xmath89 now consider the multi - site mean - field theory for a one - dimensional crystal , and , to be concrete , consider a cluster size of @xmath90 .",
    "noting that when the order parameters @xmath45 are non - zero the ground state wave function is still of the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi - as - cluster - product ] ) , it is then simple to show that @xmath91 note that for the homogeneous system all order parameters are equal , and one has that @xmath92 .",

    "the scaling form follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : trouble ] ) , and below and in our figures we denote this finite - size corrected condensate fraction to be denoted by @xmath95 .    the quantum phase that appears at the mott - insulating phase boundary",
    "is known to be the bose glass phase @xcite .",
    "the condensate fraction in this phase , at least for finite systems , is non - zero . however , unlike the homogeneous system , for a disordered system the superfluid stiffness , @xmath96 , may be zero while the condensate fraction , @xmath0 , is non - zero . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "this is purported to be associated with islands of condensate that are not phase coherent with one another @xcite .",
    "below we show how the complete phase diagram can be ( approximately ) determined from the condensate fraction alone .",
    "we now turn to the evaluation of the phase boundaries and an examination of the properties of the quantum phases for a two - dimensional square lattice having spinless bosons described by the disordered bose - hubbard model , given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dbh ] ) , and present our numerical results for both the site - decoupled single - site mean - field theory and for our multi - site formulation .",
    "we have solved this problem for a variety of lattice sizes such that the number of lattice sites times the number of complexions of disorder is 40,000 , and the lattice sizes range up to 200@xmath1200 sites .",

    "for example , when we look at the results from the multi - site mean - field theory we see that the inclusion of intra - cluster hopping leads to nonuniform occupation of all sites ( in general ) for isolated clusters , since , in the areas where the order parameter has not been developed , bosons can only hop between sites belonging to a single cluster while inter - cluster hopping is suppressed . to minimize the ground state energy particles need to reorganize themselves , and since the on - site energy , @xmath148 , differs from site to site , so does the particle density . in the areas where the order parameter is non - zero bosons",

    "( [ eq : k0-i ] ) ) , which , as emphasized above , leads to the multi - site theory retaining some of the inter - particle spatial correlation effects . because of this , the momentum distribution of bosons in the mott insulator phase is not a simple sum of the occupation numbers on each site , instead containing other terms for which the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nk ] ) runs over the individual cluster sites .",
    "these effects are completely washed out if the single - site formulation is used . in the bose glass phase ( fig .",

    "the above results makes clear that it is in the bose glass phase that the advantages of using msmft instead of ssmft are most noticeable .",

    "we have derived a multi - site mean - field theory for the disordered bose - hubbard model , and compared the results found from such an approach with those obtained from the more familiar site - decoupled single - site theory .",
    "the main differences between the single - site and multi - site formulations of mean - field theory are : ( i ) one includes the effects of intra - cluster hopping , thereby producing a perturbation theory that includes intra - cluster particle - particle correlation effects in the unperturbed eigenstates ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : k0-i ] ) ) .",
    "( ii ) one incorporates some aspects of the spatial variation of the on - site energies in the unperturbed eigenstates ( the cluster eigenstates of eq .",
    "( [ eq : k0eigs ] ) depend on intra - cluster complexions of disorder ) , while in single - site theory for the unperturbed eigenstates there is only one on - site energy .",
    "we found that the multi - site theory predicts a stable mott insulator phase for greater hopping frequencies than the single - site formulation .",
    "this is consistent with parallel studies of the similar problem for homogeneous lattices @xcite .",
    "additionally , for both ssmft and msmft theories we showed that the stability of the mott insulator phase depends on the complexion of disorder  even for lattices of size 200@xmath1200 sites our results did not converge to a single value of @xmath113 , the mott insulator to bose glass transition . it would be interesting to see if this dependence on the complexion of disorder is also observed in the experimental systems .",

    "of course , we are limited to finite lattices , so no rare lifshitz regions can be included , and other theoretical approaches are more appropriately suited for examining their role in determining the phase diagram of the system in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this limit may also lead to the results of stochastic mft theory being correct for the condensate fraction , namely that it vanishes in the bose glass phase , although such a conclusion would need to be shown to be robust under the extrapolation of this inventive approach to a multi - site mean - field theory .",
    "we found that in the bose glass phase the position distribution of particles obtained within multi - site theory is correlated with the underlying random potential of the on - site energies , whereas the single - site theory predicts that the vast majority of sites are uniformly occupied with a given number of bosons per site ( only sites which developed a non - zero order parameter have varying occupation numbers ) .",
    "this is clearly a result of incorporating the spatial variation of the on - site energies in the eigenstates of each isolated cluster .",
    "we have also shown that these two formulations of the mean - field theory give rise to two qualitatively different momentum distributions of particles .",
    "the multi - site formulation predicts a characteristic bell shape thereof , a feature that is clearly a product of the inclusion of the intra - cluster hopping in the zero order perturbation hamiltonian ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : nk ] ) ) . the single - site theory ,",
    "however , does not show such a behaviour since it does not incorporate any of the particle - particle correlations effects .",
    "we also presented a way of identifying  approximately  the bose glass - to - superfluid phase transition and therefore completing full phase diagram of the bose - hubbard model , solved on a finite size lattice for a given complexion of disorder , from the condensate fraction alone . by examining the correlation length",
    "we have seen that this approximation is expected to be accurate near the tip of mott lobe , but less accurate away from it .",
    "taken together , these results suggest that the msmft better accounts for the variations of the boson density and order parameter distribution that are expected in the bose glass phase , and it seems here that the potential utility of this approach could best be exploited .",
    "future work will discuss the dynamics that are found , in the bose glass phase , using msmft .",
    "the differences between the two formulations in the superfluid phase do not seem to be as dramatic , although quantities such as the correlation length and the momentum distribution are accessible via msmft .",
    "we acknowledge helpful conversations with tom mcintosh and eugene zaremba on the development of the multi - site mean - field theory for ordered lattices .",
    "one of us ( rjg ) thanks andrew parks for discussions regarding algorithms for multidimensional numerical integrations .",
