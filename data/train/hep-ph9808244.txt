    "superstring theories have been , for now a number of years , the most promising candidates for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "two major problems , however , have impeded extracting definite phenomenological predictions from these constructions : the large vacuum degeneracy and the issue of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking .",
    "a large amount of work has been devoted to studying both questions , which has led to the proposal of several mechanisms and models in order to solve them . among those ,",
    "gaugino condensation @xcite is the most promising one , and it has been implemented , more or less successfully , in superstring inspired scenarios .",
    "this is a non - perturbative effect which provides the typically flat stringy fields , the dilaton and the moduli , with a non - trivial potential which could eventually lead to their stabilization at realistic values .",
    "it can also give rise to susy breaking at the so - called condensation scale ( @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the reduced planck mass and @xmath2 is the string coupling constant ) , relating therefore both major problems of superstring phenomenology . so far all this is happening in the hidden sector of the theory , governed by a strong - type interaction , and , in this simple picture , gravity is responsible for transmitting the breakdown of susy to the observable sector ( where the sm particles and susy partners live ) , parameterized in terms of the gravitino mass @xmath3 which sets the scale of the soft breaking terms .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is typical of many superstring constructions to have anomalous @xmath4 symmetries whose anomaly cancellation is implemented by a green - schwarz mechanism @xcite , where the dilaton plays a crucial role .",
    "this anomalous symmetry induces a fayet - iliopoulos ( f - i ) d - term in the scalar potential , and this will generate extra contributions to the soft terms",
    ". therefore one might expect an interesting interplay between susy breaking through gaugino condensation and the presence of the @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , there is now a new scale in the theory , that of the @xmath4 breakdown , @xmath5 . given that both hidden and observable sector fields are charged under this symmetry , the f - i term will act effectively as an extra source of transmission of the susy breaking between sectors .",
    "in fact , given that in general @xmath6 , one expects that the f - i will set the scale of the soft breaking terms .",
    "all these issues have been recently discussed in a number of papers @xcite , but always in a global susy limit . in ref .  @xcite it was pointed out that the contribution from the d - terms to the soft breaking terms is the dominant one , which was claimed to have phenomenological merits . in particular",
    ", this could be useful to get naturally universal soft masses , thus avoiding dangerous flavour changing neutral current effects .",
    "on the other hand , in ref .  @xcite it was shown that that discussion had ignored the crucial role played by the dilaton in the analysis .",
    "furthermore , it was claimed ( based on particular ansatzs for the khler potential ) that the situation is in fact the opposite , namely the contribution from the f - terms to the soft breaking terms is the dominant one .    here ,",
    "we present the generalization of the results obtained in ref.@xcite to the supergravity ( sugra ) case , which is the correct framework in which to deal with effective theories coming from strings . whereas we have checked that the sugra corrections do not affect significantly the minimization of the potential , and thus the vacuum structure of the theory , we have seen that they are crucial for a correct treatment of the soft breaking terms .",
    "this is due to the fact that the analysis of the soft terms relies heavily on the cancellation of the cosmological constant , an issue which can only be properly addressed in the context of sugra .",
    "this single extra requirement will introduce very powerful constraints on the structure of the soft terms , which entirely contradict previous results .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section ii we first extend the formulation of the f - i term made in ref.@xcite to sugra , as a previous stage to analyze the vacuum structure of a typical model first presented in @xcite . in section iii",
    "we study the cancellation of the cosmological constant , and we apply the constraints we get from it to the calculation of the soft breaking terms , obtaining a definite hierarchy between the different contributions to the scalar masses and the gaugino mass . in section",
    "iv we illustrate our general results with a particular example of a gaugino condensation mechanism that stabilizes the dilaton , namely one condensate with non - perturbative corrections to the khler potential .",
    "finally , in section v we present our conclusions .",
    "before studying the interplay between gaugino condensation and the presence of a fayet - iliopoulos d - term in string theories , let us briefly introduce the general sugra formulation of such a f - i term . as has been stressed by arkani - hamed et al .",

    "therefore , the @xmath4 invariant @xmath15-part of the sugra action reads _",
    "d = d^4 [ ld ] with k = k(^*_i e^2q_ix , _ i ;  s+|s - _ gsx ) . [ kx ] extracting the piece proportional to @xmath16 in eq .  ( [ ld ] ) , and eliminating @xmath16 through its equation of motion we find @xmath17 $ ] , where is as in ref .  @xcite . ]",

    "so it is not surprising that for large @xmath61 the role of gravity as the messenger of the ( f - type ) susy breaking is not overriden by the `` gauge mediated '' ( d - type ) susy breaking associated to the f - i term .    concerning gaugino masses ,",

    "<S> the interplay between gaugino condensation and an anomalous fayet - iliopoulos term in string theories is not trivial and has important consequences concerning the size and type of the soft susy breaking terms . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we examine this issue , generalizing previous work to the supergravity context . </S>",
    "<S> this allows , in particular , to properly implement the cancellation of the cosmological constant , which is crucial for a correct treatment of the soft breaking terms . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain that the d - term contribution to the soft masses is expected to be larger than the f - term one . </S>",
    "<S> moreover gaugino masses must be much smaller than scalar masses . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate these results with explicit examples . </S>",
    "<S> all this has relevant phenomenological consequences , amending previous results in the literature .    </S>",
