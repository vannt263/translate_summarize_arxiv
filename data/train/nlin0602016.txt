    "the recent experimental observations of spatial solitons in nonlocal media such as nematic liquid crystals @xcite , lead glasses @xcite , renewed an interest to coherent structures in spatially nonlocal nonlinear media . in the spatially",
    "nonlocal media the nonlinear response depends on the wave packet intensity at some extensive spatial domain .",
    "nonlocality is a key feature of many nonlinear media .",
    "it naturally appears in different physical systems such as plasmas @xcite , bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite , optical media @xcite , atomic nuclei @xcite , liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "an important property of spatially nonlocal nonlinear response is that it prevents a catastrophic collapse which usually occurs in local self - focusing media when the power of the two- or three - dimensional wave packet exceeds some critical value .",
    "in particular , a rigorous proof of absence of collapse during the wave packet propagation described by the nonlocal nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) with sufficiently general symmetric real - valued response kernel has been presented in @xcite . in the absence of collapse",
    ", the competition between diffraction spreading and nonlinear self - action leads to formation of the stationary solitary wave structures - solitons and vortex solitons .",
    "different types of two - dimensional self - trapped localized wave beams have been predicted and experimentally observed in various nonlinear media @xcite .",
    "fundamental solitons are the lowest - order localized structures with a single peak in the intensity distribution and transversely constant phase .",
    "a vortex is the structure with ring - like intensity distribution , with the dark hole at the center where the phase dislocation takes place : a phase circulation around the axis of propagation is equal to @xmath0 .",
    "an integer @xmath1 is refered to as topological charge .",
    "the important integral of motion associated with this type of solitary wave is the angular momentum , which can be expressed through the vortex power @xmath2 and topological charge @xmath1 as follows : @xmath3 .",
    "thus , vortices ( or spinning solitons ) are the localized structures with nonzero angular momentum . while the fundamental solitons are robust in a collapse - free media , the spinning solitons may possess a strong azimuthal modulational instability @xcite . as a result",
    ", the vortex decays into several ordinary solitons which fly off carrying out its energy and angular momentum .",
    "though vortices can be stabilized in media with competing local nonlinearities @xcite , it occurs only in the extreme regime when the higher - order contribution to the nonlinearity dominates .",
    "the recent investigations @xcite have shown that the different kinds of nonlocality of the nonlinear response can also suppress or completely eliminate the symmetry - breaking azimuthal instability for one - ring and double - ring single - charge ( @xmath4 ) vortex solitons .",
    "the recent experiments @xcite have confirmed an existence of stable single - charge vortex solitons in the the nonlocal media with thermal optical nonlinearity .",
    "the multicharge vortices ( @xmath5 ) are unstable in the media with thermal nonlocal nonlinearity , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite by linear stability analysis of small azimuthal perturbations and direct numerical modeling . on the other hand , the robust propagation of two - charge vortex ( @xmath6 )",
    "solitons has been observed in the numerical simulations @xcite for the model based on gaussian - type kernel of the nonlocal media response function .",
    "we perform here the linear stability analysis for the model used in ref .",

    "the @xmath7th bound state has a central bright spot surrounded by @xmath7 rings of varying size . in the local nonlinear media",
    "the higher - order solitons with zero angular momentum show the azimuthal instability @xcite similar to the instability of the vortex solitons .",
    "the rings which surround the central peak possess an azimuthal instability . as a result , the higher - bound structures decay into several fundamental solitons .",
    "we reveal here that nonspinning higher - order solitons can be stabilized in the nonlocal medium",
    ".    another important feature of nonlocal nonlinear media is the possibility of existence of composite soliton structures . a composite soliton structure , or a multi - soliton complex is a self - localized state which is a nonlinear superposition of several fundamental solitons @xcite .",
    "multi - soliton structures in nonlocal media were considered first in refs .",

    "suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite was studied in ref . @xcite",
    "and it was shown that dipole- , triple- , and quadrupole - mode solitons can be made stable .",

    "we have simulated numerically the dynamics of the multisolitons in the presence of initial noise and performed simple variational analysis .",
    "it turns out that multisolitons are extremely robust at sufficiently high input power in a highly nonlocal media .",
    "therefore , these predictions open the prospects for the experimental observations of a wide class of stable coherent structures in various nonlocal nonlinear media ."
