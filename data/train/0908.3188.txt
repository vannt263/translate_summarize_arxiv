    "in recent years , the study of the nonequilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum systems has attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "the main motivation for these studies lies behind the spectacular success that experimentalists have achieved in trapping and manipulating ultracold quantum gases .",
    "this has allowed them to , for example , load ultracold bosons in optical lattices and study the collapse and revival of the matter wave interference after quenching the interaction strength from deep in the superfluid regime into deep in the mott insulating regime @xcite , and to observe the damping of the dipole oscillations when the center of mass of the gas was displaced away from the center of the trap @xcite .",
    "since these atomic gases are trapped , cooled , and manipulated in a very high vacuum , i.e. , in no contact with any kind of thermal or particle reservoir , a fundamental question that arises is whether after a sudden perturbation the system will relax to thermal equilibrium ( an equilibrium in which observables are described by standard statistical mechanical ensembles ) .",
    "the usual assumption is that thermalization occurs in general .",
    "however , recent experiments in one - dimensional ( 1d ) geometries ( created by a deep two - dimensional optical lattice ) have failed to observe relaxation to a thermal distribution after a quench @xcite .",
    "the absence of thermalization can be understood in the very special regime in which the system is at an integrable point @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in ref .  @xcite the gas was perturbed away from integrability and thermalization did not occur .",
    "other experiments in 1d geometries ( generated by an atom chip ) have reported the indirect observation of thermalization @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the transverse confinement was not as strong as the one induced by the optical lattice in ref .",
    ". the question of whether strict one dimensionality could affect the outcome of the relaxation dynamics has not been fully addressed experimentally .",
    "the particular case in which the system is at an integrable point lends itself to combined analytical and numerical studies , which have allowed theorists to show that in that case the relaxation dynamics after a quench lead to nonthermal equilibrium distributions of few - body observables @xcite .",
    "in addition , a generalization of the gibbs ensemble , which takes into account the conserved quantities that make the system integrable , has been shown to successfully describe experimental observables after relaxation @xcite .",
    "further analytical and numerical works have analyzed the relevance of the generalized gibbs ensemble to different models and observables and addressed its limits of applicability @xcite .",
    "when the systems are far away from integrability , for example in higher dimensions , the expectation is that they should thermalize .",
    "recent numerical work has shown this to be the case for bosons in two dimensions , studied with exact diagonalization @xcite , and for fermions studied within the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) approximation @xcite .",
    "in addition , thermalization in the isolated two - dimensional bosonic case could be understood within the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth ) proposed by deutsch @xcite and srednicki @xcite , in which the individual eigenstates of the many - body hamiltonian exhibit thermal behavior @xcite .    in one - dimensional nonintegrable systems ,",
    "the situation is a bit more subtle as many models can be tuned ( by changing some hamiltonian parameters ) to be arbitrarily close to integrable points .",
    "an early study of the relaxation dynamics in fermionic systems when breaking integrability , using time - dependent density renormalization group ( tdmrg ) @xcite , concluded that thermalization does not occur even if the system is perturbed away from the integrable point .",
    "another early work in 1d , also using tdmrg , studied the relaxation dynamics of the ( nonintegrable ) bose - hubbard model when quenching the system across the superfluid - to - mott - insulator transition @xcite . in that case",
    "the authors concluded that thermalization occurs in some regimes but not in others .",
    "more recently , we have performed a systematic study of thermalization in finite 1d systems of hardcore bosons .",
    "our results indicate that far away from integrability the system does thermalize @xcite . however , thermalization breaks down as one approaches the integrable point .",
    "an important question that still needs to be answered is what happens with the point at which thermalization breaks down as one approaches the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it may either move toward the integrable point or toward some point away from integrability .",
    "more powerful numerical techniques or analytical approaches may be required to answer that question , which will not be addressed here .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite to the fermionic case , which allows us to discuss some of the issues that remained open in ref .",
    "in particular , the time scales required for different observables to relax to a stationary `` equilibrium '' distribution , and the description of the observables after relaxation .",
    "we also study how the closeness to an integrable point affects the dynamics and thermalization after a quantum quench .",
    "as in earlier works @xcite , we show that the breakdown of thermalization for our observables is directly linked to the breakdown of eth .    the presentation is organized as follows . in sec .",

    ", the fermionic hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonianf ] ) can be mapped onto the identical hamiltonian for hardcore bosons ( [ eq : hamiltonianhcb ] ) ( up to a boundary effect ) , i.e. , the fermionic operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonianf ] ) just need to be replaced by operators describing hardcore bosons .",
    "this can be done using the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite , and implies that in the thermodynamic limit both systems have the same spectrum and identical diagonal correlations",
    ". however , off - diagonal correlations and related observables , such as the momentum distribution function , are very different for fermions and bosons .",
    "a finite value of @xmath10 still allows for a mapping of the fermionic hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonianf ] ) onto a hamiltonian of hardcore bosons .",

    "( [ eq : hamiltonianhcb ] ) .",

    "the study of the nonequilibrium dynamics and thermodynamics of these systems is performed using full exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonianf ] ) . for our largest system sizes , eight fermions in 24 sites ,",
    "the total hilbert space has dimension @xmath26 .",
    "we take advantage of the translational symmetry of the lattice , which allows us to block diagonalize the full hamiltonian while the dimension of the largest block ( in @xmath27 space ) is @xmath28 .    in this work",
    ", we focus our analysis on two observables .",
    "the first one in the momentum distribution function @xmath29 which is the fourier transform of the one - body density matrix ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "as mentioned before , this observable behaves very differently for fermions as compared with the hardcore bosons to which they can be mapped .",
    "we should add that @xmath3 is usually measured in experiments with ultracold quantum gases via time - of - flight expansion .",
    "the second observable of interest is the density - density structure factor @xmath31 which is the fourier transform of the density - density correlation matrix .",
    "since we work at fixed number of fermions @xmath32 , the expectation value of @xmath33 is always @xmath34 and , as usual , we set it to zero by subtracting that trivial constant .",
    "the structure factor can be measured in cold gases experiments by means of noise correlations @xcite .",
    "we will restrict our study of the nonequilibrium dynamics to the case in which the system is taken out of equilibrium by means of a quench .",
    "quenches are a special way to induce dynamics by starting with an eigenstate of some initial hamiltonian @xmath35 , and then instantaneously changing the hamiltonian ( at time @xmath36 ) to some final time - independent hamiltonian @xmath37 .    as mentioned previously , our model is integrable for @xmath22 .",
    "since we are interested in studying the effect that approaching an integrable point has on the dynamics and thermalization of the system , we take the initial state to be an eigenstate of a system with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and then quench the nearest - neighbor parameters @xmath9 and @xmath11 to @xmath40 , @xmath41 without changing @xmath10 , @xmath12 , i.e. , we only change @xmath42 .",
    "this quench is performed for different values of @xmath10 , @xmath12 as one approaches the integrable point @xmath22 .",
    "notice that our quenches do not break translational symmetry .",
    "for that reason , we always select the initial state to be one of the eigenstates of the initial hamiltonian in the total @xmath43 sector .",
    "since translational symmetry is preserved , only states with zero total momentum are required to calculate the exact time evolution of the system @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the time - evolving state , @xmath46 is the initial state , @xmath47 are the eigenstates of the final hamiltonian with zero total momentum , energy @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "the sum runs over all the eigenstates of the total @xmath43 sector . in this section",
    ", we perform the exact time evolution of up to eight fermions in lattices with up to 24 sites .",
    "this means that the largest total @xmath43 sector diagonalized had 30666 states .",
    "in contrast to classical systems , where one has to perform the time evolution in order to compute the long - time average of any observable , in isolated quantum systems ( where the time evolution is unitary ) one can predict such time averages without the need of calculating the dynamics . since the wave function of any initial state can be written in terms of the eigenstates of the final hamiltonian @xmath50 as @xmath51",
    ", one finds that the time evolution of the quantum expectation value of an observable @xmath52 can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the matrix elements of @xmath52 in the basis of the final hamiltonian .",
    "this in turn implies that the infinite time average of the observable can be written as @xmath55 we have assumed that , as in the case of generic ( nonintegrable ) systems , the spectrum is nondegenerate and incommensurate .",
    "this means that if the expectation value of @xmath52 relaxes to some kind of equilibrium value ( up to the recurrences that must occur if the system is isolated ) , that value should be the one predicted by eq .",

    "our results here have been obtained for small one - dimensional lattices , which are relevant to current experiments in one - dimensional geometries @xcite . however , several important questions remain to be addressed in future works . for example , what happens to the point at which thermalization breaks down ( at all temperatures ) as one increases the system size .",
    "far from integrability , we find that for our small systems thermalization occurs whenever the effective temperature is @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "another question that needs to be addressed is what happens with the window of energies where thermalization fails to occur far from integrability as one increases the system size .",
    "finally , there is the question of the time scale that @xmath3 of the fermions takes to relax to the thermal distribution , and the emergence of intermediate quasistationary distributions @xcite , as the size of the system is increased . experiments with ultracold gases will generate many new questions and help address the current ones .",
