    "there have been rapid and exciting developments over the last decades on the interface between paticle physics and cosmology@xcite .",
    "particle physicists pursing the goal of unification would like to test their theories at energy scales far beyond those available now or in the future in terrestrial accelerators .",
    "an obvious place to look is to the very early universe , where conditions of extreme temperature and density obtained .",
    "meanwhile , cosmologists have sought to understand feature of the universe currently observed by tracing their history back to that very early period .",
    "an exciting outcome of the interplay between particle physics and cosmology is the cosmic string theory@xcite .",
    "it is strongly believed to solve the short - distance problems of quantum gravity at the plank scale by providing a fundamental length @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the string tension , and provides a bridge between the physics of the very small and the very large .",
    "the research in the topic of cosmic strings can help to explain some of the largest ",
    "scale structure seen in the universe today .",
    "past researches have mostly focused on the dynamical properties of the cosmic strings@xcite , and all of them are based on some particular models . in our previous work@xcite , by making use of the @xmath0mapping topological current theory@xcite , which play an important role in discussing the topological invariant and structure of the physical system@xcite , we have studied the topological structure and topological quantization of cosmic strings without any concrete model . in this paper , based on our previous work , we will study the generating , annihilating , colliding , splitting and merging of cosmic strings in topology viewpoint , and give the branch conditions of cosmic strings without any concrete model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , a brief review of the topological structure and the topological quantization of cosmic strings is given . in section 3 , by virtue of the implicit function theorem , the creation and annihilation of cosmic strings at the limit points is discussed .",
    "the bifurcation behaviour of strings is detailed in the neighborhood of bifurcation point in section 4 .",
    "cosmic strings are linear defects@xcite in four dimensional space - time @xmath5 , analogous to those topological defects found in some condensed matter systems such as vortex lines in liquid helium , flux tubes in type - ii superconductors or disclination lines in liquid crystal , and they are closely related to the torsion tensor of the riemann  cartan manifold @xcite .    in vierbein theory ,",
    "the torsion tensor is expressed by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the vierbein field . as in our previous work@xcite , by analogy with the t hooft s viewpoint@xcite , to establish a physical observable theory of space  time defect , we must first define a gauge invariant antisymmetrical 2order tensor from torsion tensor with respect of a unit vector field @xmath8 as follows @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a kind of @xmath11 gauge potential .",
    "this shows that the antisymmetrical tensor @xmath12 expressed in terms of @xmath13 is just the @xmath11 like gauge field strength ( i.e. the curvature on @xmath11 principle bundle with base manifold @xmath5 ) , which is invariant for the @xmath11like gauge transformation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an arbitrary function .",
    "in order to study the string theory , we should extend the traditional concept of topological currents@xcite which have been used to study the topological properties of point like defects@xcite , and introduce a topological tensor current of second order from torsion . from the above discussions , we can define a topological tensor current @xmath16 as the dual tensor of @xmath17 as follow @xmath18    very commonly , topological property of a physical system is much more important and worth investigating mediculously .",
    "it is our conviction that , in order to get a topological result , one should input the topological information from the beginning .",
    "two useful tools@xmath19-mapping method and composed gauge potential theory@xcite just do the work . as mentioned in our previous works@xcite , the decomposation of @xmath20 can be expressed by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the order parameter field of cosmic strings , and @xmath23 is the planck length introduced to make the both sides of the formula with the same dimension@xcite . with the decomposition of @xmath13 in ( [ 2.star ] )",
    ", @xmath16 can be expressed in terms of @xmath24 by @xmath25 which shows that @xmath16 is just an antisymmetric and identically conserved 2-order topological tensor current . because of the topological property of @xmath24 , we input the topological information successfully . obviously , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a section of the sphere bundle @xmath28@xcite .",
    "the zero points of @xmath29 are just the singular points of @xmath30    by making use of the expression of @xmath24 in ( [ 2.star ] ) and the laplacian relation in @xmath0-space @xmath31 the topological tensor current @xmath32 can be rewritten in a compact form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the general jacobian determinants @xmath35 it is obvious that @xmath16 is non - zero only when @xmath36    suppose that for the system of equations @xmath37 there are @xmath38 different solutions , when the solutions are regular solutions of @xmath19 at which the rank of the jacobian matrix @xmath39 $ ] is 2 , the solutions of @xmath40 can be expressed parameterizedly by @xmath41 where the subscript @xmath42 represents the @xmath42-th solution and the parameters @xmath43 span a 2-dimensional submanifold with the metric tensor @xmath44 which is called the @xmath42-th singular submanifold @xmath45 in @xmath46 for each @xmath45 , we can define a normal submanifold @xmath47 in @xmath5 which is spanned by the parameters @xmath48 with the metric tensor @xmath49 , and the intersection point of @xmath47 and @xmath45 is denoted by @xmath50 . by virtue of the implicit function theorem , at the regular point @xmath50 , it should be hold true that the jacobian matrix @xmath51 satisfies @xmath52    more deeper calculation can lead to the total expansion of the string current @xmath53 or in terms of parameters @xmath54@xmath55 where @xmath56 is a positive integer called the hopf index@xcite of @xmath19-mapping on @xmath47 and @xmath57 is the brouwer degree@xcite of @xmath19-mapping .",
    "@xmath58 is the @xmath59function on singular submanifold @xmath45@xcite with the expression @xmath60    from the above equation , we conclude that the inner structure of @xmath61 or @xmath62 is labelled by the total expansion of @xmath63 , which includes the topological information @xmath56 and @xmath64 it is obvious that , in ( [ 2.5 ] ) , when @xmath65 and@xmath66 are taken to be time - like evolution parameter and space - like string parameter , respectively , the inner structure of @xmath16 or @xmath62 just represents @xmath38 strings moving in the 4dimensional riemann - cartan manifold @xmath5 .",
    "the 2-dimensional singular submanifolds @xmath67 are their world sheets .",
    "the hopf indices @xmath56 and brouwer degree @xmath68 classify these strings . in detail",
    ", the hopf indices @xmath56 characterize the absolute values of the topological quantization and the brouwer degrees @xmath69 correspond to strings while @xmath70 to antistrings .",
    "but from the above discussion , we know that the results mentioned above are obtained under the condition @xmath71 .",
    "when this condition fails , i.e. the brouwer degrees @xmath72 are indefinite , what will happen ? in what follows , we will study the case when @xmath73 .",
    "it often happens when the zero of @xmath74 includes some branch points , which lead to the bifurcation of the topological current .    in order to discuss the evolution of these strings and to simplify our study ,",
    "we select the parameter @xmath65 as the evolution parameter @xmath75 , and let the string parameter @xmath76 be fixed . in this case",
    ", the jacobian matrices are reduced to @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "the branch points are determined by @xmath79 for the fixed @xmath80 , and they are denoted as @xmath81 .",
    "in @xmath19-mapping theory usually there are two kinds of branch points , namely the limit points and the bifurcation points@xcite , each kind of them corresponds to different cases of branch process .",
    "first , in this section , we study the case that the zeros of the order parameter field @xmath74 includes some limit points which satisfying @xmath82 for simplicity , we consider @xmath83 only .    for the purpose of using the implicit function theorem to study the branch properties of sstrings at the limit points , we use the jacobian @xmath84 instead of @xmath51 to search for the solutions of @xmath85 .",
    "this means we have replaced @xmath86 by @xmath75 . for clarity",
    "we rewrite the first two equations of ( [ 2.88 ] ) as @xmath87 taking account of ( [ 2.89 ] ) and using the implicit function theorem , we have a unique solution of the equations ( [ 2.91 ] ) in the neighborhood of the limit point @xmath81 @xmath88 with @xmath89 . in order to show the behavior of the strings at the limit points , we will investigate the taylor expansion of ( [ 2.92 ] ) in the neighborhood of @xmath81 . in the present case , from ( [ 2.89 ] ) and the last equation of ( [ 2.88 ] ) , we get @xmath90 i.e. @xmath91 then , the taylor expansion of @xmath92 at the limit point @xmath93 is @xmath94 @xmath95 therefore @xmath96 which is a parabola in @xmath86@xmath75 plane . from ( [ 2.93 ] ) we can obtain two solutions @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which give the branch solutions of strings at the limit points . if @xmath99 ( fig 1(a ) ) , otherwise , we have the branch solutions for @xmath100 ( fig 1(b ) ) .",
    "since the topological current of strings is identically conserved , the topological quantum numbers of these two generated strings must be opposite at the limit point , i.e. @xmath101 , the former is related to the creation of cosmic strings and antistrings in pair at the limit points , and the latter to the annihilation of the cosmic strings .",
    "in the following , let us turn to consider the case of bifurcation point in which the additional restrictions are @xmath102 these two restrictive conditions will lead to an important fact that the function relationship between @xmath75 and @xmath86 or @xmath103 is not unique in the neighborhood of bifurcation point @xmath81 .",
    "the equation @xmath104 which under restraint of ( [ 2.94 ] ) directly shows that the direction of the integral curve of ( [ 2.95 ] ) is indefinite at the point @xmath81 .",
    "this is why the very point @xmath81 is called a bifurcation point of the multistring current . with the aim of finding the different directions of all branch curves at the bifurcation point",
    ", we suppose that @xmath105 from @xmath106 , the implicit function theorem says that there exists one and only one function relationship @xmath107 with the partial derivatives @xmath108 , @xmath109 . substituting ( [ 2.97 ] ) into @xmath110",
    ", we have @xmath111 which gives @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114",
    "@xmath115 where @xmath116 from these expressions we can calculate the values of @xmath117 and @xmath118 at @xmath81 .    in order to explore the behavior of the string at the bifurcation points ,",
    "let us investigate the taylor expansion of @xmath119 in the neighborhood of @xmath81 , which according to the eqs.([2.88 ] ) must vanish at the bifurcation point , i.e. @xmath120 from ( [ 2.99 ] ) , the first order partial derivatives of @xmath121 with respect to @xmath86 and @xmath75 can be expressed by @xmath122 making use of ( [ 2.98 ] ) , ( [ 2.101 ] ) and cramer s rule , it is easy to prove that the two restrictive conditions ( [ 2.94 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath123 @xmath124 which give @xmath125 by considering ( [ 2.96 ] ) .",
    "the second order partial derivatives of the function @xmath126 are easily to find out to be @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath129 which at @xmath81 are denoted by @xmath130 then , taking notice of ( [ 2.100 ] ) , ( [ 2.102 ] ) and ( [ 2.103 ] ) , we can obtain the taylor expansion of @xmath121 in the neighborhood of the bifurcation point @xmath81 @xmath131 which by ( [ 2.99 ] ) is the behavior of @xmath132 in this region . because of the second equation of ( [ 2.88 ] ) , we get @xmath133 which leads to @xmath134 and @xmath135 the different directions of the branch curves at the bifurcation point are determined by ( [ 2.104 ] ) or ( [ 2.105 ] )",
    ". there are four possible cases :    * @xmath136 : for @xmath137 , from ( [ 2.104 ] ) we get two different solutions @xmath138 which is shown in fig .",
    "2 , where two cosmic strings collide at the bifurcation point @xmath81 .",
    "this shows that two cosmic strings meet and then depart at the bifurcation point .",
    "* @xmath136 : for @xmath139 , there is only one solution @xmath140 which includes three important cases shown in fig .",
    "firstly , two cosmic strings tangentially collide at the bifurcation point ( fig .",
    "secondly , two cosmic strings merge into one cosmic string at the bifurcation point ( fig .",
    "thirdly , one cosmic string splits into two cosmic strings at the bifurcation point ( fig .",
    "3(c ) ) .    *",
    "@xmath141 ) : for @xmath137 , from ( [ 2.105 ] ) we have @xmath142 as shown in fig .",
    "4 , there are two important cases : ( a)one cosmic string splits into three cosmic strings at the bifurcation point ( fig .",
    "( b ) three cosmic strings merge into one at the bifurcation point ( fig .",
    "4(b ) ) .",
    "* @xmath143 : the equations ( [ 2.104 ] ) and ( [ 2.105 ] ) give respectively : @xmath144 this case is obvious as in fig . 5 , which is similar to the third situation .",
    "the remainder component @xmath145 can be given by @xmath146 where partial derivative coefficients @xmath147 and @xmath148 have been calculated in ( [ 2.98 ] ) .",
    "at the end of this section , we conclude that in our string theory there exist the crucial case of branch process .",
    "this means that , when an original string moves through the bifurcation point in the early universe , it may split into two strings moving along different branch curves . since the topological current of strings is identically conserved , the sum of the topological quantum numbers of these two splitted strings must be equal to that of the original string at the bifurcation point , i.e. @xmath149 for fixed @xmath42 .",
    "this can be looked upon as the topological reason of string splitting .",
    "in this paper , with the gauge potential decomposition and the so called @xmath150-mapping method , we obtain the topological current to describe the strings in 4dimensional riemann  cartan manifold . in the early universe , by discussing the properties of the zero points of the vector field @xmath19 and the expansion of the delta function @xmath63 , we get the topological quantization of the strings under the condition that the jacobian @xmath151 , and pointed out that the singular manifolds are just the evolution manifolds of these strings . when the jacobian @xmath152 , i.e. at the critical points of @xmath0-mapping , it is shown that there exist the crucial case of branch process . based on the implicit function theorem and the taylor expansion , the origin and bifurcation of the strings",
    "are detailed in the neighborhoods of the limit points and bifurcation points of @xmath19-mapping respectively , i.e. the branch solutions at the limit points and the different directions of all branch curves at the bifurcation points are calculated out . because the topological current of these strings is identically conserved",
    ", the topological charges of these strings will keep to be constant during the branch processes , which means that the topological quantum numbers of the two generated string currents must be opposite at the limit point and , at the bifurcation point , the sum of the topological quantum numbers of the splitted strings must be equal to that of the original .",
