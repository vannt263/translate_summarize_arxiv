    "in non - relativistic  as well as in relativistic quantum mechanics  time @xmath4 is the parameter that rules time evolution . for any operator @xmath5 in the hilbert space : @xmath6,\\;\\ ; \\rightarrow a(t)\\ ] ] the same applies to position @xmath7 : it is the parameter that rules spatial displacements : @xmath8,\\;\\ ; \\rightarrow a(x)\\ ] ] coordinate representation comes from the first days of quantum mechanics @xmath9 . in other words , a position operator",
    "@xmath10 does exist such that @xmath11 .",
    "an immediate consequence is the probabilistic interpretation for the wave function : the probability of finding the particle at @xmath7 is @xmath12 . in the non - relativistic case",
    "the picture is more vivid as there @xmath13 .",
    "the very existence of @xmath10 prompts for the question : does exist a time operator @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 ?",
    "an affirmative answer would lead us to consider @xmath16 as the probability of finding the particle at the instant t. needless to say , the temptation of understanding  finding \" in terms of  running into \" is difficult to resist .    in his contribution to the encyclopedia of physics  @xcite , pauli advised against a time operator .",
    "his argument can be understood in terms of the stone - von neumann theorem  @xcite : given two self adjoint operators @xmath17 : @xmath18=i \\leftrightarrow \\sigma(\\hat{a})= \\sigma(\\hat{b})\\ ] ] where @xmath19 denotes the operator spectrum .",
    "now , for elementary systems @xmath20 is the real line , while @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the particle mass .",
    "therefore , if the system has a hamiltonian either : there is no time operator conjugate to @xmath23 , or @xmath24 is not self - adjoint .",
    "the problem appears in the poincare group once a mass shell ( a representation of the elementary system ) is chosen .",
    "in fact , if @xmath25 and there exist a conjugate position operator @xmath26 , then operating with @xmath26 throws the particle momentum out of the mass shell : @xmath27 this is among the reasons for demote time and position to mere parameters while promoting the fields to operators in quantum field theory .",
    "classically @xmath44 is the jacobi - lie transformation to action - angle variables .",
    "quantum mechanically , @xmath45 is the mller wave operator  @xcite that connects the eigenstates of @xmath46 to the actual energy eigenstates : @xmath47 we now proceed in parallel with the eigenstates of the time operator  @xcite :      we showed above the very simple expression for the classical time of arrival of the free particle @xmath49 . a properly ordered quantum version is @xmath50 notice that @xmath51 are operators while @xmath7 is a parameter and @xmath22 the particle mass . here , the roles of space and time are the opposite than in the standard formulation : here @xmath52 changes as @xmath7 changes . in other words ,",
    "the instant of arrival depends parametrically on the arrival position .",
    "all the steps leading to the quantities of interest in the presence of a potential @xmath53 have been spelled  @xcite in detail in the literature .",
    "the final result is that the eigenstates for the arrival at @xmath7 in the instant @xmath4 are @xmath54    this is a highly symbolic notation because @xmath7 , the detector position , is not a property of the particle , but something alien to it . accepting this",
    "as it is , the result is a time eigenstate in terms a position ( the detector location ) eigenstate .",
    "the spectral decomposition of the time of arrival operator is given , in terms of these eigenstates as : @xmath55 following the born rule , the probability that a particle prepared in the state @xmath56",
    "-at @xmath57 , as everything here is in the heisenberg picture- arrives at @xmath7 in the instant @xmath4 is @xmath58 .",
    "there are some subtleties in the more realistic case of 3 space dimensions  @xcite . in particular not all the states that one can prepare at @xmath57",
    "may be eventually detected .",
    "on the contrary , the detected states form a subspace of the hilbert space , and it is necessary to project on it to get physically meaningful predictions .",
    "armed with this artillery , we attack again the questions of physical interest that we abandoned paragraphs above . in particular , if we put a potential ( a barrier , a well , a dielectric , a force field , etc ) in between the initial state and the detector , what should we expect for the distribution of times of arrival ? that is : we record the time of arrival of the particle at the detector , then repeat the experiment once and again with the same initial state and record the successive times of arrival attained . at the end of the day , the experiment has accumulated a statistical distribution in times of arrival to be compared with the theoretical predictions :  @xcite @xmath59 , for the probability density , @xmath60 for the average time of arrival , etc . the obvious question is : do they match ?",
    "we have devoted some time to this question and the answer is a mixture of yes and noes . the formalism is a step forward with respect to other tunneling times that appear in the literature in the sense that it also predicts the probability densities in times of arrival to be recorded experimentally .",
    "this goes far beyond the wigner time delay and other tunneling times , that are just a number for each experiment .",
    "in fact , our result for the time of arrival can be read as the quantum average of the wigner time delay , but in addition predicts probabilities , r.m.s .",
    "uncertainties , and the like .",
    "long time ago , hartman  @xcite explored the times involved in the crossing of classically forbidden barriers , reaching the conclusion that the crossing was instantaneous .",
    "he explained the effect using heuristic arguments in terms of the wigner time delay .",
    "the time of arrival formalism gives an explanation using the basic postulates of quantum mechanics .",
    "we have applied the formalism  @xcite to the biphoton berkeley experiments .",
    "it is possible to get  @xcite the photon time of arrival , in vacuum and in a passive dielectric .",
    "therefore one can predict the distribution in times of arrival of both components in the biphoton , the idler and the signal and compare with the experiment .",
    "experiment and theory match  @xcite .",
    "note that these experiments are just exercises in detecting times of arrival .",
    "it is not surprising that in order to describe the experiment , the standard theoretical treatment ( in which operators or wave functions are functions of time ) , has to be taylored to finally match the time of arrival formalism .",
    "we also explored other physical systems , in particular those in which resonances play a prominent role . in spite of our earlier expectations ,",
    "the formalism was not able to handle these situations . on the contrary , as a predictor of the time of arrival in the presence of resonances , it was a complete failure . in the rest of the paper we present in simple terms the failure and the lesson that we extracted from it .",
    "consider a state @xmath56 prepared at the left of a potential region and place an ( ideal ) detector at a position @xmath7 at the right of that region .",
    "the amplitude for detecting the particle at @xmath7 at the time @xmath4 is : @xmath61 in the above expression we have introduced a decomposition of the identity in the form @xmath62 .",
    "this is a scattering situation , therefore with @xmath56 prepared at the left of the barrier @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the initial wave packet in momentum space .",
    "also , with the detector placed at the right of the barrier @xmath65 now everything is clear : we get no trace of resonances because we only used scattering states .",
    "perhaps , we should get a more complete answer if we plug into the formalism a richer decomposition of the unity .",
    "more specifically , would be possible to predict the delays due to the existence of resonances ? .",
    "yes , but incorporating gamow states into the space of intermediate states .",
    "j. l. is indebted to lidia ferreira for invitation to attend the meeting .",
    "he also thanks the participants for vivid and engaging discussions and for teaching him a lot about resonances .",
