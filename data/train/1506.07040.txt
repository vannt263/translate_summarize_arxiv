    "evolution equations often contain some structural information reflecting inherent physical properties such as positivity of solutions , conservation laws , and entropy dissipation .",
    "numerical schemes should be designed in such a way that these structural features are preserved on the discrete level in order to obtain accurate and stable algorithms . in the last decades ,",
    "concepts of structure - preserving schemes , geometric integration , and compatible discretization have been developed @xcite , but much less is known about the preservation of entropy dissipation and large - time asymptotics .",
    "entropy - stable schemes were derived by tadmor already in the 1980s @xcite in the context of conservation laws , thus without ( physical ) diffusion .",
    "later , entropy - dissipative schemes were developed for ( finite - volume ) discretizations of diffusion equations in @xcite . in @xcite , a finite - volume scheme which preserves the gradient - flow structure and hence the entropy structure",
    "is proposed .",
    "all these schemes are based on the implicit euler method and are of first order ( in time ) only .",
    "higher - order time schemes with entropy - dissipating properties are investigated in very few papers .",
    "a second - order predictor - corrector approximation was suggested in @xcite , while higher - order semi - implicit runge - kutta ( dirk ) methods , together with a spatial fourth - order central finite - difference discretization , were investigated in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "multistep time approximations were employed , but they can be at most of second order and they dissipate only one entropy and not all functionals dissipated by the continuous equation . in this paper , we remove these restrictions by investigating time - discrete runge - kutta schemes of order @xmath0 for general diffusion equations .",
    "we stress the fact that we are interested in the analysis of entropy - dissipating schemes by `` translating '' properties for the continuous equation to the semi - discrete level , i.e. , we study the stability of the schemes .",
    "however , we will not investigate convergence , stiffness , or computational issues here ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
