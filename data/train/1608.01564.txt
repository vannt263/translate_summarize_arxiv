    "since the early 1960 s , determinantal ( and closely related pfaffian ) random point processes have served as a key tool in asymptotic analysis of exactly solvable probabilistic systems in mathematics and physics . in the late 1990 s , the domain of their applicability",
    "was extended to random growth models and interacting particle systems in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , see , e.g. , the surveys of johansson @xcite , ferrari - spohn @xcite , borodin - gorin @xcite , and references therein .",
    "about ten years ago , the work of tracy - widom @xcite on asymptotics of the partially asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep , for short ) started a new wave of developments .",
    "the asep is one of the most basic interacting particle systems whose large time asymptotics did not seem to be susceptible to standard determinantal or pfaffian methods .",
    "tracy - widom employed a different approach ( coordinate bethe ansatz ) , and a flurry of activity followed , see , e.g. , a survey of corwin @xcite and references therein .",
    "tracy - widom showed that the large time fluctuations of current for the asep with step initial data were described by the gue tracy - widom distribution , which originated from the airy determinantal point process @xcite .",
    "however , before the large time limit the determinantal processes were nowhere to be seen .    some hope for a greater involvement of the determinantal point processes appeared with the work on asymptotics of directed polymers in random media .",
    "for the point - to - point continuum brownian polymer ( equivalently , the kardar - parisi - zhang stochastic partial differential equation with so - called narrow wedge initial data ) , that is known to be a limiting object for the asep due to bertini - giacomin @xcite , it was shown by amir - corwin - quastel @xcite , calabrese - le doussal - rosso @xcite , dotsenko @xcite , and sasamoto - spohn @xcite , that the laplace transform of the distribution of its partition function is equal to an average of a simple multiplicative functional on the airy determinantal process ( cf . a recent note of borodin - gorin @xcite for this form of the result ) .",
    "for another , semi - discrete brownian polymer model known as the oconnell - yor polymer @xcite , it was shown that the laplace transform of the partition function can be realized via averages over signed determinantal point processes , see oconnell @xcite , imamura - sasamoto @xcite",
    ". unfortunately , signed ( i.e. , non - positive ) measures are often of limited probabilistic use , although imamura - sasamoto were able to take the limit of their result to see the kpz - airy connection of the previous paragraph .",
    "one goal of this work is to make an explicit connection between the asep and determinantal point processses , and to show how this connection can be used for analyzing the large time asymptotics .",
    "the asep can be realized as a limit of another random growth system known as the stochastic six vertex model ; its definition goes back to gwa - spohn @xcite .",
    "very recently , borodin @xcite noticed that certain averages over the stochastic six vertex model coincide with other averages for the so - called schur measures ( introduced by okounkov in @xcite ) ; the latter can be thought of as prototypical examples of the determinantal point processes ; see , e.g. , @xcite for detailed explanations",
    ".    taking the asep limit of this coincidence is not entirely straightforward , and this is the first main result of the present paper .",
    "the family of determinantal processes that corresponds to the asep ( with step initial data ) turns out to be a novel one .",
    "we call them the discrete laguerre ensembles ; they live on @xmath0 , and their correlation kernels are expressed through the classical laguerre orthogonal polynomials .",
    "we prove that the q - laplace transform of the asep height function is equal to the average of a multiplicative functional on the corresponding discrete laguerre ensemble .",
    "we then show how this result implies three different asymptotic regimes for the asep .",
    "they correspond to two limit regimes of the discrete laguerre ensemble . in the first limit , that deals with finitely many first asep particles",
    ", the discrete laguerre ensemble converges to the discrete hermite ensemble ( that goes back to borodin - olshanski @xcite ) . in the second and third limits , that correspond to the asep height function convergence to the gue tracy - widom distribution and the solution of the kpz equation mentioned above",
    ", the discrete laguerre ensemble converges to the airy process .",
    "the difference between these two limits on the side of the discrete laguerre ensemble is provided solely by different asymptotic behavior of the multiplicative functional .",
    "we also explain what the corresponding limits mean for the stochastic six vertex model ( the convergence to the gue tracy - widom distribution was previously obtained in @xcite and @xcite ) .    in another direction ,",
    "we introduce the discrete jacobi ensemble , explain the operator - theoretic mechanism of how all our discrete ensembles arise from the theory of classical orthogonal polynomials , and exhibit numerous limit transitions between more classical orthogonal polynomial ensembles and the new ones .",
    "let us now explain our results in more detail .",
    "in what follows , we assume the reader s familiarity with the basic definitions and properties of the determinantal point processes ; cf .",
    "section [ sect2.1 ] and references therein .    rather than introducing the discrete laguerre ensemble ( denoted by @xmath1 below ) by a formula ,",
    "let us explain a general construction , of which @xmath1 is a particular case .",
    "let @xmath2 be a measure on @xmath3 such that ( a ) it is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure @xmath4 ; ( b ) it has finite moments of any order ; ( c ) the moment problem for @xmath5 is determinate .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the orthonormal polynomials with respect to @xmath5 with positive highest coefficients ; they form a basis in @xmath7 .",
    "given a point @xmath8 inside the support of @xmath5 , consider the orthogonal decomposition @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the subspaces of functions supported by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "we have an isomorphism of hilbert spaces @xmath14 by means of the correspondence @xmath15 , @xmath16 . under this isomorphism",
    ", the decomposition @xmath9 induces an orthogonal decomposition @xmath17 .",
    "denote by @xmath18 and @xmath19 the orthogonal projections onto @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "these operators define determinantal point processes @xmath22 on @xmath23 .",
    "the correlation kernels of these point processes ( i.e. , the matrices of @xmath24 ) have the form @xmath25    choosing @xmath26 to be one of the three classical weights @xmath27 we arrive at the discrete hermite , laguerre , and jacobi ensembles , respectively .",
    "they are very different from the orthogonal polynomial ensembles associated with these weights ; those live on @xmath3 and have finitely many particles almost surely ; cf .",
    "section [ sc : orth - poly - ens ] .",
    "note that the roles of the index and the independent variable of the orthogonal polynomials are swapped when one moves from one type of ensembles to the other , which bears certain similarity to the idea of _ bispectrality _ , cf .",
    "grnbaum @xcite .",
    "one relation between the two types of ensembles is discussed in section [ sc : duality ] .",
    "the discrete hermite ensembles previously appeared in borodin - olshanski @xcite , two special cases of the discrete jacobi kernel previously appeared in borodin - kuan @xcite , the discrete laguerre and the general discrete jacobi ensembles appear to be new .",
    "a key feauture of @xmath22 that is important to us , is that for the classical weights , the correlation kernels are spectral projections for rather simple second order difference operators on @xmath23 .",
    "these are noting else but the _ jacobi matrices _ associated with the corresponding systems of orthogonal polynomials . in other words , they are tridiagonal @xmath28 matrices that represent operators of the form @xmath29 in the basis of the corresponding orthogonal polynomials , where @xmath30 is the operator of multiplication by the independent variable @xmath31 in @xmath32 .",
    "the concrete form of these matrices for the classical weights can be found in section [ sect5 ] below .",
    "let us explain why this is important to us .",
    "the classical hypergeometric polynomials of the askey scheme can always be viewed as eigenfunctions of a suitable second order differential or difference operator ( with polynomial coefficients ) .",
    "hence , the correlation kernels of the corresponding orthogonal polynomial ensembles can be viewed as spectral projections for the associated operators .",
    "there are several asymptotic regimes , in which the orthogonal polynomials ensembles cease to be such ( for example , the number of particles may tend to infinity ) , but the associated differential / difference operators are easily seen to have a limit . in the case",
    "when the state spaces before and after the limit are discrete , this is actually sufficient to claim the convergence of the spectral projections for such operators , thus the convergence of the corresponding determinantal point processes .",
    "moreover , the computations are significantly simpler than in more traditional approaches to such asymptotics that typically involve steepest descent arguments or the riemann - hilbert problem methods . however , if some of the involved state spaces are continuous , we are currently not able to produce a rigorous justification of this method , and it should be viewed as heuristic . however , in all the examples we know , it does yield a correct statement with rather modest computations , and it also provides possibly the simplest way of guessing the correct scaling .",
    "the difference operator approach to asymptotics of the correlation kernels was first used by borodin - olshanski in @xcite .",
    "it was also applied by borodin - gorin @xcite , gorin @xcite , olshanski @xcite , and ( independently ) discussed in the continuous setup by tao @xcite ; see also bornemann @xcite .",
    "it is also somewhat similar in spirit to the idea of edelman - sutton @xcite that lead to spectacular progress in understanding limits of the general @xmath33-ensembles in random matrix theory , with the key difference that one has to deal with _",
    "random _ tridiagonal matrices in that case ( which is much harder ) .",
    "another related idea can be found in the work of breuer ",
    "duits @xcite , who used the asymptotics of jacobi matrices to prove gaussian fluctuations for the corresponding orthogonal polynomial ensembles with growing number of particles .    in section [ sect6 ]",
    "below , we use our approach to prove several limiting statements , realizing the discrete hermite , laguerre , and jacobi ensembles as limits in different ways , cf .",
    "figure [ fig ] in that section .",
    "one of those statements deals with convergence of the meixner orthogonal polynomial ensembles to the discrete laguerre ensemble .",
    "it is this limit that , coupled with a result of @xcite on matching observables of the stochastic six vertex model and the schur measures ( of which meixner ensembles are a special case ) , leads to our first main result :    consider the asep on @xmath34 with particles occupying all negative integers at time @xmath35 , and with the left jump rate @xmath36 and right jump rate @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath38 denote the number of the asep particles weakly to the right of the position @xmath39 .",
    "then at any time moment @xmath40 , and for any @xmath41 , @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the determinantal point process of the form @xmath45 with the laguerre weight @xmath46 .",
    "a similar relation holds for @xmath47 as well .",
    "a further limit transition from the discrete laguerre ensemble to the discrete hermite one , which we also prove with the operator method , leads to the asymptotics of the first asep particles at large times .",
    "another limit transition , from the discrete laguerre ensemble to the airy one , involves a continuous state space ( for airy ) , so we provide heuristics with our approach , which in particular gives us the ( not so trivial ) correct normalization for the limit .",
    "the only piece of this limit transition that is needed for the gue tracy - widom asymptotics proof for the asep is the convergence of the distribution of the first particle , and that is actually equivalent ( thanks to the results of section [ sc : duality ] ) to the convergence of the first particle of the laguerre orthogonal polynomial ensemble to the first airy particle  a well - known fact that goes back to @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the convergence of the weakly asymmetric asep to kpz requires the convergence of the full discrete laguerre ensemble to airy , and we sketch the argument , assuming that convergence .",
    "a rigorous proof would require a verification of the trace - class convergence of the kernels by a different method ( e.g. , by classical steepest descent arguments ) , which is standard but technical , and we do not pursue it .",
    "finally , we utilize the convergences of the meixner and charlier orthogonal polynomial ensembles to the discrete hermite and airy ensembles to give similar large - scale asymptotic statements for two instances of the ( higher spin ) stochastic six vertex model in a quadrant .",

    "on the other hand , different pairs may produce the same determinantal measure .",
    "for instance , one can replace @xmath62 by an equivalent measure @xmath71 and at the same time replace the kernel @xmath63 by the new kernel @xmath72 ; then the correlation measures do not change .",
    "another possibility is to keep @xmath62 fixed but replace @xmath63 with @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is a nonvanishing function on @xmath48 ; this transformation also does not affect the correlation measures .    which pairs @xmath69 , @xmath70 give rise to determinantal measures is a difficult question if one does not impose additional assumptions .",
    "usually one wants @xmath62 to be some natural measure ( say , the lebesgue measure on @xmath75 , or the counting measure when @xmath48 is a discrete space ) , but the problem is related to a description of admissible kernels @xmath63 .",
    "however , in the present paper we are dealing with a very special class of correlation kernels , and for our purposes the following abstract existence theorem is sufficient .",
    "let @xmath76 be a closed subspace of the hilbert space @xmath77 , and @xmath78 be the orthogonal projection onto @xmath76 .",

    "<S> we introduce a family of discrete determinantal point processes related to orthogonal polynomials on the real line , with correlation kernels defined via spectral projections for the associated jacobi matrices . for classical weights , </S>",
    "<S> we show how such ensembles arise as limits of various hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials ensembles .    </S>",
    "<S> we then prove that the q - laplace transform of the height function of the asep with step initial condition is equal to the expectation of a simple multiplicative functional on a discrete laguerre ensemble  a member of the new family . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to obtain the large time asymptotics of the asep in three limit regimes : ( a ) for finitely many rightmost particles ; ( b ) gue tracy - widom asymptotics of the height function ; ( c ) kpz asymptotics of the height function for the asep with weak asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we also give similar results for two instances of the stochastic six vertex model in a quadrant . </S>",
    "<S> the proofs are based on limit transitions for the corresponding determinantal point processes . </S>"
