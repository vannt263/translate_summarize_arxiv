    "as explained in the main text , there are possible experimental means for a direct estimation of the gaussianity @xmath5 of a state @xmath6 , without going through a full state tomography procedure . the trace overlap between @xmath6 and @xmath52",
    "can be estimated without the need for a full state tomography , using the modified eight - port homodyne detection scheme @xcite  shown in fig.[fig2 ] . however",
    ", this would first require performing homodyne measurements on @xmath6 for the identification of its covariance and the reconstruction of the reference gaussian state @xmath52 . as a consequence ,",
    "the whole procedure requires multiple copies of @xmath6 just as does a full state tomography procedure , but on the other hand it avoids the instabilities which appear in the reconstruction of the wigner function from experimental data .",
    "other scenarios for measuring @xmath5 without constructing @xmath52 from @xmath6 may exist , and it is a subject that deserves further investigation .",
    "from the general solution for the gaussianity - bounded mss as derived in the main text , we notice that for the interval @xmath159 the uncertainty @xmath19 is saturated by mixtures of @xmath48 and @xmath160 .",
    "the dependence of the minimum value of the uncertainty on gaussianity degree  can be easily derived by solving the equation @xmath161 for @xmath19 when @xmath162 .",
    "one arrives to the following inequality @xmath163    for @xmath89 , the mss have been proven in the main text  to comprise the following set , @xmath164 in the limit @xmath86 , @xmath136 , and while @xmath165 is kept finite . employing the identity",
    "@xmath166 one can derive the following dependece of the lower limit of uncertainty as a function of gaussianity,@xmath167 thus , ignoring the remaining tiny interval @xmath168 ( note @xmath169 ) , we can summarize the gaussianity - bounded uncertainty relation as @xmath170{c}\\frac{2 + 2\\sqrt{1-g}-g}{g},\\qquad\\mathrm{if~}\\frac{3}{4}<g\\leq1\\\\\\frac{g}{2-g},\\qquad\\mathrm{if~}g>1.\\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]",
    "the method we have developed here in order to re - derive the sr uncertainty relation and derive the gaussianity - bounded uncertainty relation , is applicable not only in the case where all constraints are linear in the density matrix elements of @xmath6 , i.e. , of the form @xmath171 , but also in the case where we have non - linear constraints such as the purity @xmath172 or the von neumann entropy @xmath173 .",
    "it is not difficult to show that in the presence of non - linear constraints , the necessary condition on the existence of degeneracies in the spectrum of the hermitian operator constructed from the constraints is lifted .",
    "the necessary condition is , in this case , that every eigenvector @xmath33 of the density matrix of the solution @xmath174 should be an eigenvector with positive eigenvalue of a hermitian operator derived in a similar way as in the main paper @xmath175 moreover , as it is dictated by the above condition eq .",

    "<S> the situation is simple and all states @xmath90 are mss . for this region </S>",
    "<S> , the minimum on the uncertainty as a function of @xmath5 can be easily derived @xmath91 employing eq.(21 ) ( see appendix  d ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for @xmath92 , the minimum @xmath19 for fixed @xmath5 displays discontinuities . in the interval @xmath93 @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> is minimized by the states @xmath94 with the value of @xmath82 satisfying eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ inter ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we see that all number states @xmath47 are included in this set for specific values of @xmath5 corresponding to the upper bound of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ inter ] ) for different @xmath82 s . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) , we see that most of the mss ( solid line ) consist of these states @xmath47 and their close neighborhood . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as advertised , we conclude that all eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator are extremal in the sense that they exhibit the lowest allowed uncertainty given their non - gaussian character .    for other values of @xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> once the value of @xmath82 is identified from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ inter ] ) , one has to solve the polynomial equation @xmath95 for @xmath19 in order to find the dependence of the uncertainty @xmath19 on the gaussianity @xmath5 . for @xmath96 , which covers most of the interesting region , the explicit expression </S>",
    "<S> ( see appendix  c ) is @xmath97 in the appendix  b we show that , in addition to the states @xmath94 and @xmath90 , which are phase invariant , the set of mss comprises all states with a covariance matrix proportional to the identity which can be transformed onto them by phase averaging . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , all states connected to @xmath94 and @xmath90 by linear canonical transformations are mss as well , since the uncertainty @xmath19 and gaussianity @xmath5 are invariants of the group .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions_.we have exhibited a variational method to derive the schrdinger - robertson uncertainty relation by casting it as an eigenvalue problem related to the harmonic oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> it follows an `` inverse path '' to the common procedure where the lower bound on the uncertainty is derived based on commutators , and the mss are then identified . </S>",
    "<S> such an inverse procedure was put forward by dodonov and manko for the derivation of purity - bounded uncertainty relations @xcite , but it appears that our method is more generally applicable because it is based on the amplitudes of the eigenstates of the mss instead of its density matrix elements , see appendix  d. it is especially useful when constraints are included that account for some knowledge on the state .    in particular , we have found a new uncertainty relation that is bounded by the degree of gaussianity @xmath5 of the state . </S>",
    "<S> the state with the overall lowest uncertainty @xmath19 is of course the gaussian ground state @xmath98 of the harmonic oscillator ( @xmath57 ) , but we have thus proven that the non - gaussian states with the lowest uncertainty @xmath19 for a fixed @xmath99 include as well mixtures of subsequent number states @xmath47 of the harmonic oscillator . among these mss , </S>",
    "<S> the number states play a prominant role as they are the only phase - invariant pure states . </S>",
    "<S> we have proven that the number states are also _ extremal _ in this uncertainty - related sense , thereby extending to all ( non - gaussian ) eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator the celebrated minimum - uncertainty property of its ( gaussian ) ground state . </S>",
    "<S> given the considerable attention that non - gaussian states are attracting in continuous - variable quantum information theory , see e.g. @xcite , unveiling this extremality property of harmonic oscillator states may contribute to further fundamental progress in the field , especially in relation with quantum metrology .    </S>",
