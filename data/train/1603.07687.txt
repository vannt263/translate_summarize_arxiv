    "@xcite .",
    "the resonance @xmath0 is the lightest scalar state ; moreover , it decays only into pions .",
    "then , one is lead to think that @xmath0 is important for the determination of pion multiplicities in thermal models for relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) . indeed , a simple inclusion of @xmath0 as a breit - wigner resonance would lead to a sizable increase ( about 3 - 5% @xcite ) of pions .",
    "however , in these proceedings ( based on the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we show that this conclusion is not correct .",
    "in fact , when the repulsion of pion - pion interaction in the scalar - isotensor channel is properly taken into account using the formalism developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the effect of @xmath0 cancels to a very good numerical accuracy .",
    "we show this cancellation in a model independent way , since the only input is given by well - known pion - pion scattering data in these two scalar channels .    as a net result",
    ", one can neglect in thermal models both the scalar - isoscalar attraction due to @xmath0 and the non - resonant scalar - isotensor repulsion .",
    "a successful description of hadron emissions at the freeze - out of relativistic heavy - ion collisions is achieved with the help of thermal models .  for simplicity , we restrict our presentation to a gas which includes stable pions ( @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 stays for isospin , @xmath8 for the total spin , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 for parity and charge - conjugation ) , the @xmath11-resonance ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , the resonance @xmath0 ( @xmath5 @xmath14 ) , and the non - resonant contribution of the repulsion in the @xmath15 @xmath16 channel .",

    "the logarithm of the partition function @xmath18 is given by the sum of contributions of all channels : @xmath19 all other thermodynamic quantities follow : @xmath20 @xmath21 etc .",

    "the spectral function of the @xmath11-meson is related to the phase - shift by @xcite : @xmath33 thus , one can take into account the @xmath11-meson in a thermal gas in a model independent way by introducing the well - known scattering data in eq .",
