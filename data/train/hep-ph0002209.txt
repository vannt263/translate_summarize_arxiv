    "recent developments have reinvigorated efforts to understand qcd at very high baryon density  @xcite-@xcite . for special combinations of quark colors and flavors",
    "it is likely that a superconducting gap breaks color and flavor symmetries in interesting ways .",
    "although the symmetry breaking is nonperturbative , it occurs when qcd is weakly coupled , and therefore perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) can be used to derive properties of the superconducting phase .",
    "one can conceive of scenarios in nature where it may be important to understand the behavior of qcd at high density : for instance , in neutron stars and less likely , in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "below the weak scale the standard model has the exact local gauge symmetries @xmath0 which describe the strong and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "in addition there is the exact global symmetry @xmath1 corresponding to the conservation of baryon number and the approximate global symmetries @xmath2 for a theory with @xmath3 light quarks .",
    "these global symmetries are broken by the quark masses and in addition the @xmath4 symmetry is also broken by the strong anomaly . at extremely high density ,",
    "the contribution from the anomaly is suppressed by powers of the chemical potential , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 is broken only by the light quark masses . when a color - superconductor forms via the spontaneous breaking of color and flavor symmetries , there will be pseudo - goldstone bosons that contribute to or determine the very low energy dynamics of such a system . for sufficiently low energies",
    "it is clear that an effective field theory description of these dynamics can be constructed , and will prove useful in computing contributions to observables from the far - infrared region of the theory . in recent work by son and stephanov@xcite and by casalbuoni and",
    "gatto@xcite the masses and decay constants of the pseudo - goldstone bosons in the @xmath6 color - flavor scenario were computed in the large-@xmath5 limit .",
    "it was found that the masses become independent of @xmath5 , while the decay constants depend linearly on @xmath5 .",
    "later work in @xcite@xcite and @xcite claim that the masses actually vanish in the large-@xmath5 limit and are proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "we agree with this later claim @xcite and , through the use of a hierarchy of effective theories , compute the leading contribution to the meson masses and decay constants .",
    "if we assume that the masses of the _ up _ , _ down _ and _ strange _ quarks are much smaller than the scale associated with the formation and dynamics of the color - superconducting state ( the gap @xmath8 ) , then it is appropriate to consider a theory with three flavors of massless quarks , and include mass effects in perturbation theory . in the limit of high densities the attraction leading to the gap is given by one - gluon exchange that is attractive in the color @xmath9 channel .",
    "it has been argued that the most favorable state for the system is one in which there is a formation of the `` color - flavor locked '' condensate @xmath10 ( @xmath11 , .. are color indices , @xmath12 .. are flavor and @xmath13 , ... are spin indices ) resulting in the symmetry breaking pattern @xmath14 .",
    "the value of the gap @xmath8 was computed in @xcite in the high density limit and does not have the usual bcs form but is instead given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a constant of order unity not yet computed . for lower densities , where pqcd does not apply ,",
    "the same symmetry breaking pattern was shown to occur by assuming that all quark interactions are effectively short ranged . throughout this work",
    "we assume that @xmath8 is a constant , independent of energy and momentum .",
    "as we are interested in modes close to the fermi surface where @xmath17 we can start by considering the dynamics of quarks and gluons in the ungapped system , where the dynamics are determined by the @xmath18 dimensional action , @xmath19 , @xmath20 \\ \\ \\ . \\label{qcd } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is convenient to project onto the positive and negative energy states , @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , and then eliminate @xmath22 using the equations of motion@xcite , with @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "this procedure is similar to that used in the construction of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet)@xcite . writing @xmath25 in terms of the mode expansion for @xmath21 and working in spherical coordinates , the action describing the dynamics of the modes near the fermi surface , @xmath26 , is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the action of a @xmath29 dimensional field theory .",
    "the two - component quark field @xmath30 depends on an energy @xmath31 , a momentum @xmath32 , and a unit vector pointing toward the fermi surface @xmath33 . as the anti -",
    "quarks have been integrated out of the theory at the scale @xmath5 corresponding to the top of the fermi surface , the effective field theory described by @xmath34 will be an expansion in terms of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "perturbative computations around the superconducting state can be performed by adding and subtracting a quark gap term in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "the condition that the subtracted gap term does not contribute at each order in perturbation theory is equivalent to the gap equation .",
    "the gaps for the positive and negative energy states will in general be different , and in terms of the @xmath37 fields we have an additional contribution to the lagrange density of the form @xmath38 the anti - gap , @xmath39 , has not been computed at this point in time , but a recent discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "a further simplification can be made by writing the quark fields , @xmath40 , in terms of the mass eigenstates of the condensate ( neglecting the quark masses ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 with @xmath43 are the gell - mann matrices and @xmath44 . after eliminating @xmath22 by the equations of motion ,",
