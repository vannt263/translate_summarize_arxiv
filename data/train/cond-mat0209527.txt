    "the issue of ergodicity of physical systems is not new .",
    "a system is ergodic if it goes through every point of phase space during its time evolution . in such systems ,",
    "the equilibrium averages ( i.e. , the time averages ) are equal to the ensemble averages , which are much easier to compute .",
    "anyway , we have to face the problem of non - ergodicity of many physical systems ( e.g. , the existence of even one integral of motion divides the phase space into separate subspaces not connected by the dynamics ) .",
    "the lack of ergodicity has measurable effects as the well - known difference between the static isolated ( or kubo @xcite ) susceptibility and the isothermal one @xcite .    in the widely used formalism of green s functions",
    "the issue of ergodicity appears as a difficulty in the determination of the zero - frequency functions present in the bosonic propagators @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the problem reappears also in e.g. , composite operator method @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion do not uniquely determine causal green s functions and correlation functions but only up to some momentum function which severely affects the self - consistent calculation of the retarded green s functions too .",
    "usually , these zero - frequency functions are fixed by assigning them their ergodic values , but this can not be justified a priori .",
    "wrong determination of them dramatically affects the values of directly measurable quantities like compressibility , specific heat , magnetic susceptibility . according to this ,",
    "they should be calculated case by case .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the zero - frequency functions for the heisenberg chain of spin-1/2 and show that they take non - ergodic values for finite lengths and in the bulk limit too .",
    "one of the main aims of condensed matter calculations is to compute the correlation functions of the physical system under analysis : @xmath0 where @xmath1 stands for both spatial @xmath2 and temporal @xmath3 coordinates and @xmath4 for any operator relevant to the dynamics under study .",
    "the fourier transform in frequency of the correlation functions can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates @xmath5 and eigenenergies @xmath6 of the system in the following way @xmath7\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the _ zero - frequency function _",
    "@xmath8 is defined as : @xmath9 its ergodic value is @xcite : @xmath10    in this manuscript , we focus on the heisenberg chain of spin-1/2 with periodic boundary conditions in presence of an external magnetic field directed along @xmath11 and proportional to @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the exchange coupling and @xmath16 is the spin-1/2 operator at the site @xmath2 of the chain of @xmath17 sites .",
    "we diagonalize exactly the heisenberg model on three sites in magnetic field , obtaining eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ gdef ] ) yields the following functional dependence on temperature and magnetic field of the zero - frequency function @xmath18 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) : @xmath19}\\\\ \\gamma_{s_{z}s_{z}}({\\bf i},{\\bf i}+1)=-{1\\over 36}+\\frac{5 - 4{\\rm e}^{\\beta h}+5{\\rm e}^{2\\beta h}}{18\\left[1+{\\rm e}^{2\\beta h}+2{\\rm e}^{{3\\over 2}\\beta j}{\\rm e}^{\\beta h}\\right]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can see that the zero - frequency functions behave quite differently then their ergodic values @xmath20 and with a quite strong dependence on both magnetic field and temperature . according to this ,",
    "a careful determination of them is absolutely necessary and we can not rely at all on the ergodic values .",
    "let us now analyze the situation as function of the number @xmath17 of sites . to perform calculations for chains with a number of sites greater than 4 it is necessary to use numerical tools like the exact diagonalization and the lanczos method .",
    "the thermodynamic limit will be extrapolated by means of a @xmath21 analysis .",
    "for zero temperature the ergodic value of the on - site zero - frequency functions @xmath22 is always zero , not depending on the magnetic field ; for the on - site @xmath23 it is zero excluding three cases : 1 ) @xmath24 and finite magnetic field ( @xmath25 ) ; 2 ) @xmath26 and high magnetic field @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) ; 3 ) @xmath26 and magnetic field with values corresponding to energy level crossing ( for finite n ; e.g. , @xmath29 for 3 sites ) .    properly calculated zero - frequency functions @xmath23 and @xmath22",
    "behave differently . for @xmath24 , @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "both constants are non - zero ; this is due to the degeneracy of the ground state coming from the fact that both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are constants of motion and higher value of the total spin is selected .",
    "we also have the exact relation @xmath34 , which can be derived from the algebra in absence of magnetization .",
    "the inclusion of a non - zero magnetic field removes the degeneracy , by fixing the value of @xmath32 and giving dynamics to @xmath33 , and switches the functions to their ergodic values .    for @xmath26 , @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "both constants are zero or non - zero , depending whether the number of sites in the chain is even or odd , respectively .",
    "the relation @xmath35 still holds as the magnetization is zero in this case too . the discrepancy with respect to the ergodic values for _ _",
    "o__dd chains is due to the impossibility to pair up all spins on selecting the lower value of the total spin : _",
    "_ e__ven chains have a unique @xmath36 singlet - like ground state , the _ _ o__dd ones have a degenerate @xmath37 ground state .",
    "the inclusion of the magnetic field sets @xmath22 again to zero ( except for the values generating a level crossing and , consequently , a degeneracy ) , while @xmath23 keeps its previous value or jumps to a higher one passing through level crossing values .",
    "as the magnetic field becomes high enough the system becomes fully polarized , the ground state is non - degenerate as for @xmath24 and @xmath38 , and both constants set at their ergodic values .",
    "these results were obtained solving numerically chains up to 25 sites , using exact diagonalization and lanczos method .",
    "now the main question : do these results hold also in the thermodynamic limit ? in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the zero - frequency function @xmath23 as a function of the inverse of the number of sites @xmath21 for @xmath26 and @xmath24 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . for @xmath24 ,",
    "@xmath39 is independent of the distance @xmath40 and is exactly given by @xmath41 @xcite . for @xmath26",
    ", @xmath39 is a function of the distance @xmath40 and scales with @xmath17 as shown in the figure ( the lines represent very accurate fits ) .",
    "according to this , we have a non - ergodic behavior for @xmath24 which remains in the thermodynamic limit too .",
    "we wish to point out that this result is exact and must be taken into consideration by whoever needs to compute physical    quantities like spin correlation functions and susceptibilities in the 1d heisenberg model by means of analytical methods .",
    "@xmath23 should be set to @xmath42 ; any other value , the null ergodic one too , will induce wrong results and any approximation scheme not taking this into account , directly or self - consistently , will surely fail to reproduce the physical properties of the system .",
    "non - ergodic behaviors for finite values of temperature and magnetic field can not be excluded at all and are instead probable ; we are performing numerical calculations in this direction and the results will be published elsewhere . finally , it is worth noting that non - ergodic behaviors with a functional structure ( i.e. , zero - frequency functions with dependencies on temperature and magnetic fields as rich as those found for finite size chains ) require the maximum attention in building up reliable conserving and/or self - consistent approximation scheme as any mistake in reproducing them will mine the possibility to comprehend the low - energy properties of the system .    , j. phys .",
