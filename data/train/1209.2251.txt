    "the galactocentric radial gradient of chemical abundance within spiral galaxies has become an important parameter in modeling the chemical evolution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the gradient is the manifestation of a variety of physical processes acting from galaxy formation to the present , including gas infall , star formation history , stellar initial mass function , and radial migration .",
    "historically , the observation of abundance gradients has motivated the development of analytic models of chemical evolution ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and served as a valuable constraint for detailed modeling @xcite .",
    "moreover , the characterization of the abundance profiles of spiral galaxies has significant applications to other problems , including the interpretation of stellar populations @xcite and the study of supernova explosion sites @xcite .",
    "the oxygen abundance of gas throughout the disk of star - forming galaxies can be measured via optical spectroscopy .",
    "o is the most easily accessible metallicity proxy due to its high relative abundance and its strong optical emission lines from both its major ionization states ( o@xmath3 and o@xmath4 ) .",
    "a variety of diagnostics have been developed to estimate o abundance from the flux ratios of prominent optical emission lines ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "these include `` direct '' methods , whereby the electron temperature of the nebula is derived from measurement of the weak auroral line [ ]  @xmath5 @xcite , and `` statistical '' or `` strong line '' measures , where the abundance is inferred from ratios of only the brightest elemental lines .",
    "different abundance diagnostics carry systematic discrepancies as large as @xmath6  dex ( a factor of 5 ) , which must be carefully considered when interpreting results @xcite .",
    "strong line methods have enabled extensive observational studies of the abundance distribution of distant spiral galaxies .",
    "while high quality spectra can be obtained for the nearby hii regions of the milky way , galactocentric distance can be determined more easily for external galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived a negative ( outward - decreasing ) abundance gradient from just three hii regions in m101 , and by this time it was already expected from theory that negative radial abundance gradients would be characteristic of all spiral galaxies . @xcite",
    "compiled radial o abundance profiles for 39 spiral galaxies , finding gradients ranging from @xmath7 to @xmath8  dex  kpc@xmath9only the abundance profile of ngc 2541 was inconsistent with a negative or flat gradient .    because pne abundances should reflect the older ism of their progenitors , differences between the hii region and pne abundance gradients can be used to infer time - variation in the radial abundance trend of a galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for m33 ) .",
    "a sample of high - luminosity pne should reflect current oxygen abundances in a galaxy , by selecting massive progenitors which would have formed recently .",
    "the oxygen abundances in a sample containing only the brightest pne in a galaxy would represent populations with ages from @xmath10 years earlier than the hii regions in the same galaxy @xcite . for surveys penetrating more deeply",
    ", the proportion of pne from less massive progenitors will grow quickly both because less massive stars are more common and because their resulting pne are longer lasting .",
    "however , stars of mass @xmath11 may not form pne because their envelope is ejected so slowly as to disperse before being ionized @xcite .",
    "while @xmath12 bright hii regions ( @xmath13  ergs  s@xmath9 ) are known in m31 @xcite , previous spectroscopic surveys to determine abundance have provided abundance estimates for @xmath14 of them .",
    "@xcite found a significant radial abundance gradient in a sample of 11 hii regions : o / h decreases by a factor of 4 from about @xmath15  kpc in galactocentric distance .",
    "this gradient is in agreement with an earlier study of 8 hii regions in m31 by @xcite . in an analysis of the data from both @xcite and @xcite",
    ", @xcite quantified the oxygen abundance gradient as relatively shallow among their sample of galaxies : @xmath16  dex / kpc correction to their measured abundance gradient . ] . in comparison ,",
    "the largest gradient in the @xcite sample was @xmath17  dex / kpc ( ngc 3344 ) .",
    "most recently , @xcite surveyed 46 hii regions out to about 20  kpc in the northeastern portion of m31 , finding a radial gradient in @xmath18 that is consistent with @xcite , but only among objects whose morphology was classified as `` center - brightened '' by @xcite . among hii regions of other morphologies ,",
    "they report a flat abundance profile .",
    "each of these previous surveys has relied on various strong line abundance diagnostics .",
    "additionally , abundance gradients have been derived from surveys of m31 s stellar population .",
    "@xcite found a flat radial metallicity profile among seven young b stars . @xcite estimated abundances for an older population , red giant stars , from color - magnitude diagrams of 11 fields in m31 .",
    "for radii @xmath19  kpc , they find a negative gradient similar to the nebular result of @xcite and @xcite , but they report a flattening at larger radii .",
    "m31 hosts as many as @xmath20  pne , about twice as many as the milky way @xcite . in a kinematic survey",
    ", @xcite cataloged 2615 of m31 s pne .",
    "abundances have been previously derived for less than 1% of these .",
    "@xcite determined abundances for three pne : two in the halo and one in the outer disk .",
    "the results of the largest previous spectroscopic survey of m31 pne , including 70 objects , have not yet been published @xcite .",
    "a survey of 30 nebulae in the bulge of the galaxy was performed by @xcite , but only a lower limit of abundance could be derived for 14 of the nebulae . because the survey only extended out to @xmath21  kpc and because only the bulge population is sampled , @xcite did not investigate the radial abundance gradient .",
    "recently , @xcite have derived abundances for 16 pne in the outer disk of m31 .    by providing a more thorough characterization of the abundance profile of in m31",
    ", this paper seeks to enable an improved understanding of the chemical evolution of m31 and similar spiral galaxies . in tables",
    "[ tab : obj]-[tab : derpn ] we present the largest available spectroscopic catalogs of hii regions and pne in m31 .",
    "our observations come from the hectospec multifiber spectrograph on the mmt , whose multiplexing ability provides a large advantage over previous surveys of these objects . in section  [ sec : observations ] we describe the observational parameters and analytical techniques used to produce the catalog . in section",
    "[ sec : disc ] we compare our results to previous publications and discuss trends and implications identified in the catalog .",
    "our principal findings are that a significant negative abundance gradient is only demonstrated among the brightest and most diffuse hii regions .",
    "the radial profile is more flat among dimmer or more compact hii regions , and in general there is a large amount of scatter in the physical properties of the ism of m31 .",
    "we characterize this scatter in terms of the radial distribution of extinction and abundance in hii regions and pne , and also in terms of the discrepancies among neighboring objects .",
    "we provide a summary of major results in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "small , resolved objects and unresolved h@xmath22 features were selected as hii region candidates by inspecting the images of the local group galaxies survey ( lggs , * ? ? ? * ) . additionally , some objects observed as part of the m31 cluster survey of @xcite had strong emission , and are included in the present study . some objects from the planetary nebula catalog of @xcite as well as strong and unresolved [ ]",
    "features from the lggs images were observed as pn candidates .",
    "we have excluded from our sample any objects identified as emission line stars by @xcite , one object which was found to have broad emission lines characteristic of supernova remnants , and @xmath23 objects which showed broad emission features characteristic of wr stars .",
    "we note that many m31 hii regions have diameters greater than 50  @xcite , far too large to be encompassed by a single hectospec fiber , which subtends 1.5on the sky ( @xmath24 pc at the distance of m31 ) .",
    "moreover , to facilitate a future study of the kinematic properties of nebulae in m31 , we attempted to avoid hii regions which would have a large internal velocity dispersion .",
    "for both these reasons , the largest hii regions were therefore intentionally omitted from the sample , although some objects remain ( mostly the star clusters ) that were estimated by @xcite as at least 48  pc in diameter .",
    "we assume that any inhomogeneities in spectral properties within each hii region are small and random and therefore that the region sampled by the hectospec fiber is representative of the whole ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "optical spectra were obtained with the hectospec multi - fiber positioner and spectrograph on the 6.5 m mmt telescope @xcite .",
    "the hectospec 270 gpm grating was used and provided spectral coverage from @xmath25 at a resolution of @xmath24 .",
    "some spectra did not cover [ ] @xmath26 , because of the design of the spectrograph ( alternate fibers are shifted by 30 ) , and the small blueshift of m31 . the observations were made in the period from @xmath27 as a component of a survey previously described in @xcite and were reduced in the uniform manner outlined there .",
    "the frames were first debiased and flat fielded .",
    "individual spectra were then extracted and wavelength calibrated .",
    "standard star spectra obtained intermittently were used for flux calibration and instrumental response .",
    "sky subtraction is achieved with hectospec by averaging spectra from `` blank sky '' fibers from the same exposures or by offsetting the telescope by a few arcseconds ( see @xcite ) .",
    "because local background subtraction could potentially subtract object flux from extended hii regions , we compare the spectra reduced from repeated observations of the same objects using different sky spectra , local and distant . for both stellar and diffuse objects ,",
    "we find only small differences in the ratios of h@xmath22/h@xmath28 and also [ ] /h@xmath22 .",
    "the rms of the discrepancy in the log of the flux ratio is @xmath29  dex and the mean difference is @xmath30  dex .",
    "we therefore conclude that the sky subtraction is adequate .",
    "each of 25 1  degree fields in m31 was exposed for between 1800 and 4800  s. the spectra of objects that were observed multiple times ( in overlapping fields ) have been combined , effectively summing those integration times .",
    "sample spectra are shown in figure [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the locations of emission nebulae included in this study are shown in figure [ fig : bothfinder ] .",
    "many of our hii regions fall in the `` ring of fire , '' a circular feature visible in hi density maps extending from about 8 to 15 kpc in the disk of m31 @xcite .",
    "velocities were measured using the sao xcsao software and emission line templates ( one typical of hii regions and another of pne ) .",
    "repeat measurements of 114 objects gave an rms of a single measurement of 2.1 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "we also compared our velocities with the work of @xcite , who also used a multifiber spectrograph , and @xcite who used the planetary nebula spectrograph ( which imaged in [ ] ) .",
    "the @xcite comparison revealed a mean offset of + 7.1 km  s@xmath9 with an rms of 5.4 km  s@xmath9 , while the @xcite comparison resulted in a mean offset of + 2.9 km  s@xmath9 with an rms of 15.6 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the @xcite rms was expected to be larger because of their use of the single emission line .",
    "these comparisons led us to estimate our mean error to be 3 km  s@xmath9 . the final step in the reduction was the transformation of the spectra to zero velocity using the observed velocities .",
    "these candidates were formally classified according to two - dimensional emission line ratio tests of excitation mechanism ( bpt diagrams , * ? ? ? * ) . specifically , we apply equation 1 of @xcite , which distinguishes hii regions from pne based on their locations in a diagram of [ ] /h@xmath28 ( o3 ) versus [ ] /h@xmath22 ( n2 ) ( figure [ fig : bpt ] ) .",
    "these tests have the advantage of relying on ratios of strong emission lines that are near to each other in wavelength and therefore not sensitive to reddening corrections or instrumental response .",
    "the measurement of line fluxes is described in section  [ sec : obs - lineflux ] .",
    "we adopt a slight amendment to the dividing line proposed by @xcite , illustrated by the dashed line in figure [ fig : bpt ] .",
    "this amendment is favored because it classifies as pne a number of objects that we have reason to believe are not hii regions .",
    "these objects have stellar morphologies ( see below ) and many of them are in the halo , based on their position along the minor axis ( @xmath31 kpc ) , as is illustrated in figure [ fig : bpt ] .",
    "it is not surprising that there may be small offsets in the appropriate line ratio diagnostics for different samples given slight differences in flux - measurement methodology .",
    "the amended classification we adopt to distinguish hii regions from pne is :    @xmath32    in total , we identify 407 pne and 253 hii regions among our spectroscopic sample .",
    "of these objects , 392 pne and 200 hii region spectra were observed with the atmospheric dispersion compensator ( adc , * ? ? ?",
    "for some spectra , the adc malfunctioned , and for those we do not present quantities derived from emission line flux ratios with large wavelength separations .",
    "81 of the pne do not appear to be projected onto the disk of m31 ( according to the distance along the minor axis , @xmath31 kpc , see section  [ sec : obs - galdist ] ) , and we therefore assume they are associated with the halo population .",
    "23 of the pne are hosted by the dwarf satellite galaxy rather than in m31 , according to their position and velocity in the kinematic survey of @xcite . because the s / n of these spectra are such that it is not possible to derive their abundances , we remove them from the sample and do not discuss them further .",
    "an additional 25 objects could not be classified because the s / n in their [ ] and h@xmath28 emission lines were too weak .",
    "we do not discuss these unclassified objects further .",
    "in addition to this spectroscopic classification , we have made a morphological classification for each object based on its appearance in the lggs h@xmath22 images .",
    "objects whose h@xmath22 emission appears unresolved at the resolution of these images ( @xmath33 ) are classified as `` stellar '' and those that appear extended and nebulous are classified as `` diffuse . ''",
    "we note that this is similar to the classification scheme of @xcite referred to by @xcite , where their type `` c '' or `` center - brightened '' corresponds to our `` stellar '' and their type `` d '' or `` diffuse '' corresponds to the same .",
    "we find that 7 spectroscopically - classified pne are diffuse . because most of these objects are near the dividing line in the bpt diagram , it is difficult to determine whether these are pne embedded in hii regions or simply poor spectroscopic classifications .",
    "however , these only amount to @xmath34% of our full sample of pne .",
    "about half of our spectroscopically - classified hii regions are stellar . from figure",
    "[ fig : bpt ] , it is clear that the stellar hii regions are more likely to have high o3 or n2 ratios relative to diffuse hii regions and are therefore nearer to the dividing line in the bpt diagram . it is possible that some of these objects are pne with an unusually low value of [ ] /h@xmath28 . among the sample of galactic pne in @xcite , there are some objects ( m1 - 11 and m1 - 12 ) that fall on a similar region of the bpt diagram . according to the catalogue of galactic planetary nebulae @xcite",
    ", these objects were originally classified as pne by @xcite , whose classifications were essentially morphological .",
    "it is also possible that these are extended hii regions whose h@xmath22 emission is simply dominated by the emission in the immediate vicinity of one bright star , and therefore appear compact on the lgss images .",
    "therefore the diffuse subset of hii regions in our sample may represent a cleaner sample , less likely to have pn contamination .",
    "the deprojected galactocentric distance was calculated following @xcite .",
    "we assume a distance to m31 of 770  kpc @xcite and an inclination of @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the adopted coordinates of the galactic center and position angle of the major axis , precessed from @xcite , are :    @xmath36    @xmath37    @xmath38    hereafter , we use `` galactocentric distance '' to refer to this deprojected distance . any pne with a distance projected along the semiminor axis ( @xmath39 ) greater than 4 kpc",
    ", we associate with the halo population and do not consider in our sample when fitting for radial trends in the disk .",
    "additionally , there are 3 objects that we consider halo pne given their projected distance @xmath40  kpc , despite the fact that they fall in the hii region regime of the bpt diagram .",
    "the line fluxes were measured using the line profile - fitting capabilities provided by the iraf package ` fitprofs ` .",
    "we fit gaussian profiles to a wavelength range @xmath41  in width centered on the rest frame wavelength of each line .",
    "we fit a linear continuum to @xmath41  regions of the spectra off the wings of each line . for groups of nearby lines likely to be blended",
    ", we fit simultaneous gaussians .",
    "the line flux is estimated as the integral of the fitted profile with the continuum subtracted .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in the line fluxes using the monte carlo methodology implemented by ` fitprofs ` . in these monte carlo simulations",
    ", random noise is repeatedly added to the spectrum according to a simple linear noise model dependent on two parameters : the gain of the ccd and a noise floor .",
    "we estimate the gain and noise floor for each individual line profile by comparing the spectrum of the background regions to the corresponding variance spectrum . we have compared this estimate of the line flux uncertainty to the discrepancy between line flux ratios measured in repeated observations of the same objects and find them to be comparable ; for the h@xmath22/h@xmath28 ratio , the monte carlo uncertainty estimate and the discrepancy among the repeated observations are each @xmath42 in the mean . based on the monte carlo estimate of the uncertainty in the line flux , we require that s / n@xmath43 and otherwise report a non - detection . additionally , we record the equivalent width as measured by ` fitprofs ` , if the sky - subtracted continuum level is more than @xmath44 greater than zero ( where the continuum level and its standard deviation , @xmath45 , are measured from the background regions of each line ) .",
    "the [ ] @xmath46 doublet is not resolved in these spectra , and the sum effectively measured will henceforth be referred to as [ ] @xmath47 . moreover , because @xmath47 is on the very edge of our spectral range , it has a large flux - calibration uncertainty associated with it , which is propagated through to our estimate of the flux uncertainty . as mentioned above , for some spectra , @xmath47 is outside of the observed spectral range .",
    "we note that we have made no correction for underlying stellar absorption , but we estimate that this will not significantly affect the measurement of the balmer line fluxes . using models from starburst99 @xcite ,",
    "we subtracted off underlying continua for populations with ages ranging from 4 to 20 myr for a representative low- and high - metallicity hii region ( objects hii166 and hii153 ) , see figure [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "we then measured h@xmath48 and h@xmath28 .",
    "the ratios of those two lines changes at worst by @xmath49 from the uncorrected values ( the worst case results from assuming the youngest age for the underlying population ) . as a further test of the small effect that the underlying continuum has on our measurements",
    ", we also measured h@xmath22 equivalent widths and compared those with @xmath50 ( derived from the h@xmath22/h@xmath28 emission line ratio ) , and found no significant correlation .",
    "this indicates in general that balmer absorption does nt significantly affect the measured balmer ratios for the objects in our sample .",
    "we present the measured line fluxes and their uncertainties for each object in table [ tab : mea ] . for all parameters derived from these line fluxes ,",
    "we propagate the uncertainty in the line flux via monte carlo simulations . in these simulations , we sample from a gaussian line flux probability distribution with a mean and standard deviation as reported in table [ tab : mea ] .",
    "we then report the median and standard deviation of the resulting distribution as our best estimate of the derived parameters and its uncertainty .",
    "we characterize the surface brightness of each emission line region based on its observed h@xmath22 emission line flux , even if the objects are unresolved .",
    "h@xmath22 is used for this purpose because it is strong and easily detected in nearly every spectrum .",
    "however , the 1.5  hectospec fibers generally do not cover the entire area of the diffuse emission nebulae .",
    "moreover , as the observation nights were not all photometric , there could be photometric uncertainties of a factor of a few .",
    "we attempted to place all the spectra on the same photometric scale by using the multiple observations , and find that this was successful to within a factor of 1.3 .",
    "we therefore divide our sample into three surface brightness classes ( 1 : `` dim , '' 2 : `` normal '' , 3 : `` bright '' ; see figure  [ fig : fluxdens ] ) based on the extinction - corrected h@xmath22 line flux , rather than assert a precise flux measurement .",
    "we establish separate brightness classes for the hii regions ( based on the diffuse subset only ) and pne . for spectra where the h@xmath28 line is not detected , we assume the median @xmath51 for that class ( hii region or pne ) for the purpose of calculating the extinction corrected h@xmath22 line flux .",
    "the diffuse hii regions in our sample are at @xmath52 times higher surface brightness than the pne , in the median ( or @xmath53 times brighter after extinction correction ) .",
    "moreover , the hii regions encompass a larger range in surface brightness , extending to nearly two orders of magnitude brighter in h@xmath22 .",
    "we have estimated the apparent brightness limits corresponding to these surface brightness classes by matching the hii regions in our sample to the catalog of @xcite , using the nearest objects within 5 .",
    "they use an automated code to segment diffuse emission in continuum - subtracted h@xmath22images of m31 for the identification of hii regions and pne and to measure the h@xmath22 flux and diameter .",
    "figure  [ fig : fluxdens ] shows the relation between our spectroscopic h@xmath22 flux measurements and the photometry from @xcite .",
    "the scatter in the relation is correlated with the hii region diameter , because hii regions which @xcite segment as larger objects are have a correspondingly smaller fraction of their flux fall on our hectospec fibers . among small objects ( @xmath54  pc ) , the scatter is @xmath55  dex .",
    "this relation implies that our hii  region flux bins have edges at @xmath56\\times10^{-15}~{\\rm ergs}~{\\rm cm}^{-2}~{\\rm s}^{-1}$ ] and , for pne , @xmath57\\times10^{-15}~{\\rm ergs}~{\\rm cm}^{-2}~{\\rm s}^{-1}$ ] .",
    "a reddening correction was applied to restore the balmer recombination decrement of each spectrum to its theoretical value .",
    "we assume @xmath58=2.85 , which corresponds to t=10,000k and @xmath59 for case b recombination .",
    "however , the balmer ratios are not very sensitive to any of these parameters : the assumption of case a only alters the ratio by @xmath60 and extreme temperatures and densities also have little effect : @xmath61 for @xmath62  k and @xmath63 , @xmath64 for @xmath65  k and @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the extinction curve given in @xcite was applied , with a value of 3.1 adopted for @xmath67 . in cases where we derive a negative value of the extinction in the visual band ( @xmath68 ) ,",
    "we instead assume @xmath69 .",
    "the value of the extinction derived for each object is presented in tables  [ tab : derhii ] and [ tab : derpn ] .",
    "we derive `` direct '' oxygen abundance estimates for pne by estimating the electron temperature of the gas dominant excitation zone , which can be done only if a temperature - sensitive line is detected .",
    "we use [ ] @xmath5 exclusively for this purpose ; although auroral lines from other ions ( e.g. , [ ] @xmath70 ) are detected in a few spectra , their numbers are not sufficient for a statistical sample and their s / n is typically much lower than [ ] @xmath5 .",
    "this prescription is also applied to our hii regions , however direct abundances can be derived for only @xmath71 hii regions due to the weakness of the [ ] @xmath5 line .",
    "the electron temperatures are estimated using iraf s five - level nebular modeling package ` nebular ` @xcite .",
    "the ` nebular ` task ` temden ` is first applied to iteratively estimate the o@xmath4 temperature ( @xmath72 ) and density ( @xmath73 ) of the nebula from the [ ] and [ ] line ratios , respectively .",
    "when the [ ] lines are note available , we assume a reasonable range of densities , @xmath74 ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if the measured line ratios correspond to unphysical conditions ( outside the range for which ` temden ` is calibrated , @xmath75  k and @xmath76  @xmath77 ) , we do not calculate the direct abundance .",
    "the o@xmath3 temperature is then estimated using the linear empirical relation of @xcite .",
    "the o@xmath78 and o@xmath4 abundances are then estimated using the density , ionic temperatures , and [ ] and [ ] line ratios following the ionization correction factor ( icf ) prescription of @xcite .",
    "the total oxygen abundance is taken to be the sum of these two ionic abundances .",
    "this methodology is similar to that applied in , for example , @xcite .",
    "a variety of studies have shown that stellar evolution of pne progenitors should not modify oxygen abundance at a level significant for the identification of abundance gradients from the nebulae ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that bright pne ( within @xmath79 mag of the brightest in the galaxy ) , presumably from more massive stars with shorter lifetimes , have approximately the same oxygen abundances as the surrounding ism and hii regions , to within the observational uncertainty @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that o , as well as ar and ne , abundance gradients in the milky way as measured with hii regions are reflected in observations of pne @xcite .",
    "however , oxygen may be dredged up in some low - metallicity cases ( log(o / h)@xmath80 ) and thereby enrich the pne relative to its progenitor by @xmath81log(o / h)@xmath82 dex @xcite . in high - mass pne , oxygen may be depleted by @xmath81log(o / h)@xmath83 dex during the lifetime of the progenitor via the on - cycle @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been observed that the n abundance of pne will often exceed that of the local ism @xcite  justified theoretically by nitrogen production via the cn or on cycle during the first and second dredge ups .",
    "@xcite have established empirically that the oxygen abundance gradient of milky way pne does not depend on the peimbert type of the pne or the vertical distance from the plane of the galaxy ; we therefore do not consider these parameters here .",
    "hii region abundances were calculated from the extinction - corrected line flux ratios according to a number of independently calibrated abundance diagnostics from the literature .",
    "these diagnostics each depend on a different combination of emission line ratios .",
    "each calibration has its own characteristic scatter and systematic offset as compared to the other methods @xcite .",
    "it is unclear that any particular method is superior , and some methods may be more applicable than others for certain comparisons . in particular , diagnostics tied to the direct abundance scale may agree better with stellar oxygen abundances within the same galaxy ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore employ multiple methods and keep their differences in mind when discussing results .",
    "we report the abundance derived from each method in tables  [ tab : derhii ] ( hii regions ) and [ tab : derpn ] ( pne ) .",
    "first , we apply the @xmath18 oxygen abundance calibration of @xcite , an average of three earlier methods , hereafter referred to as `` z94 . ''",
    "z94 is only calibrated for the higher - metallicity upper branch of the well - known @xmath18-abundance degeneracy .",
    "the majority of m31 hii regions may be expected to fall on this upper branch , given that all the m31 hii regions in the compilation of @xcite did .",
    "if the measured line ratios correspond to an abundance outside of the range for which z94 is calibrated ( generously , @xmath84log(o / h)@xmath85 ) , we do not record the measurement .",
    "second , we apply the [ ] / [ ] oxygen abundance calibration of @xcite , hereafter referred to as `` kd02 .",
    "'' @xcite synthesize a variety of modern photoionization models and observational calibrations to produce recommendations for producing an abundance estimate given different permutations of available emission lines .",
    "we implement the prescription outlined in the appendix of @xcite , as follows .",
    "we use the [ ] / [ ] ratio to break the degeneracy between the upper and lower branches of @xmath18 . for the upper branch",
    ", we employ the [ ] / [ ] calibration of @xcite . for the rare lower branch cases , we average the @xmath18 diagnostics of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if the measured line ratios correspond to an abundance outside of the range for which kd02 is calibrated ( @xmath86log(o / h)@xmath85 ) , we do not record the measurement .",
    "third , we apply the empirical [ ] /h@xmath22 ( `` n2 '' ) and [ ] / [ ] ( `` o3n2 '' ) oxygen abundance calibrations of @xcite , hereafter referred to as `` n06 . ''",
    "we prefer the n06 diagnostic to the similar `` pp04 '' n2 and o3n2 diagnostics of @xcite because n06 is well - calibrated in the high - metallicity regime of m31 using data from the sdss galaxies @xcite .",
    "if the measured line ratios correspond to an abundance outside of the range for which n06 is calibrated ( @xmath87log(o / h)@xmath88 ) , we do not record the measurement . because this diagnostic relies on the lines to measure the o abundance ,",
    "scatter is introduced by variations in the n / o ratio @xcite .",
    "we note also that the o3n2 diagnostic is not reliable when @xmath89 , due to line saturation , but this only occurs in a metallicity regime lower than that sampled here ( log(o",

    "the maximum extinction of pne follow a similar radial trend , but typically have smaller extinction than hii regions ( @xmath113 mag ) .",
    "it is expected that hii regions will have higher extinction than pne , because they are near the large dust clouds associated with star formation and because they are primarily found in spiral arms rather than evenly throughout the disk .",
    "pne from the halo population are also likely to be found above the disk of m31 where extinction should be negligible . moreover , hii regions are typically an order of magnitude brighter than pne and therefore may be observed through greater extinction @xcite .",

    "the measurement of any abundance gradient among the m31 hii regions depends strongly on the choice of abundance diagnostic .",
    "for example , if we employ the n06  n2 diagnostic , we measure a gradient ( @xmath121  dex  kpc@xmath9 ) that is negative at the @xmath122-level and consistent with the canonical value ( @xmath16  dex kpc@xmath9 ) of @xcite .",

    "the @xmath101-value of the spearman test suggests that a real correlation exists in all four cases , to varying degrees ( @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 ) .",
    "if the pt05 diagnostic is used , however , we do not find a significant gradient ( @xmath131  dex  kpc@xmath9 ) .",
    "the spearman test reflects the lesser significance of the radial trend in this diagnostics ( @xmath132 ) .",

    "we do not detect the temperature - sensitive auroral lines for enough hii regions to investigate the abundance gradient in the direct diagnostic .",
    "an illustrative radial oxygen abundance profile of m31 hii regions is shown in figure  [ fig : hiiprofile ] , using the n06  n2 diagnostic .",
    "this diagnostic is highlighted because it relies on only the brightest emission lines and is insensitive to flux calibration and reddening correction .",

    "the spearman @xmath101-value is fairly large ( 0.45 ) , emphasizing that there is no significant correlation between the pne abundances and galactocentric radius .",
    "however , various systematic effects influence the interpretation of this correlation , as we will discuss in section  [ sec : disc - time ] .",

    "as opposed to calculating the standard deviation of the entire sample , we partially remove the variance that would be introduced by an abundance gradient . while the kd02 , pt05 , and z94 diagnostics seem to produce the least scatter ( @xmath96  dex ) , this could be in part due to selection effects ; the emission lines necessary for calculating the r@xmath140 ratio are not accessible in fainter hii regions . if we consider the diagnostics with the largest sample size , n06  n2 , the scatter in abundance rises from @xmath141  dex from the inner to outer regions of the disk .",
    "this is significantly larger than the scatter inherent to the abundance diagnostics themselves ( e.g. @xmath142  dex for z94 and pp04 n2 , * ? ? ?",
    "the conclusion that the intrinsic scatter in the abundance gradient is larger than the observational uncertainty reflects some studies in the literature .",
    "if the best - fit gradient is subtracted from the m31 hii region abundances measured in @xcite , then the standard deviation among the abundances is @xmath143  dex  similar to what we measure with the z94 diagnostic .",
    "@xcite found an intrinsic scatter of @xmath144  dex among their 61 hii regions in m33 , and asserted that this is larger than the precision of the measurements .",
    "however , @xcite have argued that certain systematic effects have artificially increased the scatter measured by @xcite , particularly the inclusion of high - excitation hii regions and low s / n spectra . because only 4  of our spectra meet the strict s / n threshold suggested by @xcite ( e.g. s / n  ( [ ]  @xmath145 ) , our dataset is not sufficient to address the intrinsic scatter in a subset of the data as they recommend .",
    "however , any high - excitation objects in our sample of the type discussed by @xcite would instead be classified as pne ( section  [ sec : obs - class ] ) , and therefore would not contaminate the hii region statistics .",
    "moreover , the uncertainties in the strong line abundance measurements are negligible compared to the measures intrinsic scatter .",
    "for example , for the n06  n2 diagnostic our measurement uncertainties as propagated from the emission line flux uncertainties have a median of 0.03  dex and 90th percentile value 0.10  dex , much smaller than the @xmath146  dex intrinsic scatter we measure in the radial abundance profile .",

    "33% have a discrepancy in log(o / h ) of more than 0.3 dex ( figure  [ fig : localdist ] ) .",

    "this scatter is similar to the maximum discrepancy among the 8 pne and 5 hii regions ( @xmath154 and @xmath155  dex , respectively ) in the immediate solar neighborhood ( @xmath156 kpc ) observed by @xcite .",
    "only 20 neighboring pne pairs have direct abundance estimates , so we do not consider their distribution of discrepancies .",
    "we present spectra for an example of two neighboring hii regions with discrepant abundances in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "these are two diffuse hii regions ( objects hii153 and hii166 ) that are separated by only 1.93  on the sky , corresponding to a separation of @xmath157 kpc at the distance of m31 .",

    "such a scenario could also apply to the inhomogeneities we observe in the ism of m31 .",
    "due to its size and proximity , m31 provides a unique laboratory for studying the ism of a spiral galaxy ; for many extragalactic studies , only the brightest hii regions in the galaxy are accessible to spectroscopy . while the large number of relatively - dim hii regions included in our survey ( section  [ sec : obs - lineflux ] ) allows us to probe the ism properties of m31 more thoroughly than ever before , it also has the potential to introduce discrepancies with past work . here",

    "given the distance of m33 ( 840  kpc ) , their threshold for bright hii regions ( @xmath169  ergs  s@xmath9 ) is similar to our threshold for normal / bright hii regions .",
    "they attribute the surface - brightness dependence of the gradient to self - enrichment in giant hii regions .",

    "the existence of this n2 gradient , and its correlation with surface brightness , could indicate a time - varying gradient in excitation , chemical composition , or both . for r@xmath140 , the slope is never significantly different from zero in any brightness bin",
    ".    it would be difficult to distinguish time evolution in the abundance profile of m31 by comparing its pne to hii regions , due to the intrinsic scatter in the populations and the uncertainties in the determination of the abundance gradients .",
    "results would be particularly influenced by the choice of strong line diagnostic for hii region abundances , and by the cuts made on morphology / surface brightness ( section  [ sec : disc - gradient ] ) .",
    "while the oxygen abundance gradient is the most observationally accessible ( section  [ sec : intro ] ) , the radial nitrogen gradient is of particular interest because it may be the steepest of any observable element ( e.g. in m33 , * ? ? ?",
    "the models of @xcite show that the n gradient should be steeper than the o gradient due to the different timescales for production ; n is produced primarily in low and intermediate - mass stars , while high - mass stars more efficiently produce o.    the radial nitrogen abundance profile of m31 hii regions is shown in figure  [ fig : hiinitrogenprofile ] , using the diagnostics of @xcite .",
    "also shown is the highly - significant ( @xmath122 ) radial gradient for the diffuse objects as fit by the bootstrap method , ( @xmath194 ) dex + ( @xmath195 ) dex kpc@xmath9 .",
    "this slope is approximately as steep or steeper than all the oxygen abundance gradients reported for any diagnostic and morphological selection in table [ tab : fitparam ] .",
    "however , it is only one third as steep as the nitrogen gradient in m33 ( @xmath196  dex kpc@xmath9 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if we include the stellar hii regions ( @xmath197 ) , we find a gradient that is similar ( @xmath198 dex kpc@xmath9 ) .    as for the oxygen abundances",
    ", we find a large intrinsic scatter about this gradient .",
    "subtracting the fitted trend among all the hii regions , we find an rms scatter of 0.11  dex .",
    "this is significantly larger ( @xmath79 times ) the systematic uncertainty attributable to the strong line diagnostic of @xcite , who report an rms scatter of 0.05  dex ( smaller than for the equivalent oxygen abundance diagnostic ) .",
    "a variety of authors have previously derived abundance gradients for m31 from other surveys of hii regions , as well as o and b stars .    as we have discussed , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    "have previously derived the abundance gradient of m31 from surveys of hii regions . from those works",
    ", we have the canonical result of @xmath16  dex kpc@xmath9 , produced by @xcite from the combined sample of 19 hii regions from @xcite and @xcite . in their survey of 46 hii regions in m31",
    ", @xcite found agreement with this gradient , but only among center - brightened hii regions . among hii regions of other morphologies , they found no significant trends .",
    "@xcite derived oxygen abundances for 7 stars of type o and b from about 5 to 30 kpc in the disk of m31 .",
    "additionally , they provided a re - analysis of the hii regions of @xcite using modern diagnostics , producing gradients that range from @xmath199 ( p - method ) to @xmath200 ( m91 ) dex kpc@xmath9 .",
    "their least squares fit to the stars yielded an abundance gradient of @xmath201  dex kpc@xmath9 , in good agreement with the canonical result .",
    "however , they noted that if they omitted the possible multiple system ob 8 - 76 , then they instead measured a slope consistent with zero ( @xmath202  dex kpc@xmath9 ) .",
    "@xcite produced color - magnitude diagrams from hst images to derive the stellar abundance gradient in m31 , finding ( with some uncertainty in their zero point ) good agreement between the upper bound of the metallicity of the stellar population and the hii regions surveyed by @xcite and @xcite at a given radius .",
    "the results of previous surveys of hii regions and high - mass stars suggest that any discrepancy between the m31 abundance gradients derived from different sources are dependent on systematic effects related to sample selection and diagnostic .",
    "similarly , @xcite have found that the nebular abundance gradient can be smaller than , similar to , or larger than the stellar abundance gradient in the late - type spiral ngc 300 depending on the choice of diagnostic .",
    "we have presented optical spectroscopy of an unprecedented sample of hii regions and pne in a massive spiral galaxy , m31 . in total , we reported line flux measurements for @xmath203 hii regions and @xmath204 pne .",
    "we have derived the extinction , nitrogen abundance , and oxygen abundance for subsets of these objects using a variety of methods , as described in section  [ sec : observations ] . from the analysis of these observations , we emphasize the following conclusions :    1 .   for hii regions ,",
    "we find an oxygen abundance gradient generally consistent with that found by @xcite .",
    "using the n06 n2 diagnostic , we find a gradient of ( @xmath121 )  dex  kpc@xmath9 among 100hii regions .",
    "we find a significantly steeper gradient in nitrogen abundance , ( @xmath198 )  dex  kpc@xmath9 among @xmath205  hii regions .",
    "these represent relatively shallow gradients as compared to other nearby spiral galaxies",
    ". 2 .   for pne",
    ", we detect no significant oxygen abundance gradient among 51  objects for which the [ o iii ]  @xmath5 line is detected and the direct method can be applied .",
    "however , using the line ratio [ n ii]/h@xmath22 , which is measurable for most pne ( @xmath206 ) , we find significant gradients which vary systematically with pn brightness , as illustrated in figure [ fig : pnslopevslum ] .",
    "the ism of m31 is highly inhomogeneous .",
    "both the visual extinction ( @xmath51 ) and oxygen abundance vary significantly among even very nearby hii regions ( 2.9 mag and 0.6 dex for some hii regions separated by @xmath207 kpc , see figures [ fig : bothfinder ] and [ fig : localdist ] ) .",
    "moreover , the intrinsic scatter observed about the hii region oxygen abundance gradient ( @xmath208 dex , see figure [ fig : intscat ] ) is larger than the uncertainty inherent to the strong line diagnostics ( @xmath209 dex ) .",
    "similarly , the scatter among pne in our sample is @xmath160  dex .",
    "the abundance gradient derived for hii regions in m31 is dependent upon the strong line metallicity diagnostic employed , and can be affected systematically by sample characteristics such as hii region morphology and surface brightness . in particular , for observations to a given depth , some diagnostics can only be applied to low or high - metallicity hii regions , unless they have sufficient surface brightness . among more compact ( not extended , i.e. `` stellar '' ) nebulae that are spectroscopically classified as hii regions ,",
    "we find evidence of pn contamination that can lead to erroneous strong line abundance measurements . sample characteristics of this type should be taken into careful consideration to mitigate systematic effects in future surveys of the ism of nearby spiral galaxies .",
