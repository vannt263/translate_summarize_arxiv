    "nitrogenase consists of two proteins : ( 1 ) the molybdenum - iron protein , which holds the femo cofactor ( femoco ) and ( 2 ) the iron protein , which hydrolyzes mgatp and uses the energy obtained to provide the molybdenum - iron protein with electrons .",

    "( 1 ) the direct way for n@xmath0 to bind at fe atoms is head - on binding.@xcite in this mechanism n@xmath0 binds to one fe atom of the central cluster , where it is protonated until one and then the second ammonia dissociate .",

    "the theoretical predictions are , however , at variance with this mechanism , because the calculations show that n@xmath0 binding is highly endothermic.@xcite ( 2 ) sellmann and co - workers@xcite suggested an opening of the cage in analogy to smaller fe complexes . in his model ,",
    "two octahedrally coordinated low - spin fe atoms positioned in close proximity bind dinitrogen between them , where it is reduced .",

    "( 3 ) our own recent calculations@xcite support the view of cage opening even though , in our model , the fe atoms are in a high - spin tetrahedral coordination , which points towards a quite different chemistry than expected for low - spin octahedral fe atoms .",
    "the opening and closing of an sh bridge at the cofactor is critical for the activation of n@xmath0 and for the dissociation of the second ammonia .",
    "a critical role is attributed to the central ligand , which enables required bond rearrangements . in a similar approach , we were able to explain many experimental findings in the conversion of acetylene by nitrogenase.@xcite ( 4 ) another proposal@xcite suggests the opening of a sulfur bridge upon coordination of water to an fe atom , complete protonation of the central ligand , and dissociation of ammonia .",
    "then n@xmath0 inserts into the central cavity of the cofactor , where one nitrogen atom is fully protonated and dissociated , which closes the catalytic cycle .",
    "this intriguing proposal seems to be in conflict with isotope exchange ( eseem / endor ) experiments@xcite that exclude an exchange of a central nitrogen ligand .",
    "we considered the complete femo cofactor with truncated ligands as in the previous study.@xcite the histidine was replaced by imidazole , the homocitrate ligand by glycolate and the cysteine , bound to the terminal iron atom by an sh group .",

    "the gradient - corrected pbe ( ref . ) functional was used for exchange and correlation .",
    "the paw method is a frozen - core all - electron method .",
    "like other plane - wave - based methods , the paw method leads to the occurrence of artificial periodic images of the structures .",
    "this effect was avoided by explicit subtraction of the electrostatic interaction between them.@xcite wave - function overlap was avoided by choosing the unit cell large enough to keep a distance of more than 6 between atoms belonging to different periodic images .",
    "we used a plane wave cutoff of 30ry for the auxiliary wave functions of the paw method .",

    "atomic structures were optimized by damped car - parrinello@xcite molecular dynamics with all degrees of freedom relaxed .",
    "the convergence was tested by monitoring if the kinetic temperature remains below 5k during a simulation of 0.05ps ( 200 time steps ) . during that simulation ,",
    "no friction was applied to the atomic motion and the friction on the wave function dynamics was chosen sufficiently low to avoid a noticeable effect on the atomic motion .",
    "transition states were determined by applying a one - dimensional constraint on the atomic positions . in the present application ,",
    "bond - length , angle , and torsion constraints were used . to get a first upper bound for the barrier ,",
    "the specific constraint was varied within 1000 molecular - dynamics ( md ) steps .",
    "if this upper bound is less than 20kj / mol , the barrier will be easily overcome and it has not been calculated more accurately . in case of a higher estimate , the bond length was fixed to discrete values around the transition state to maximize the energy while all unconstrained degrees of freedom were allowed to relax to minimize the energy .",
    "proof that this approach , when converged , determines exactly first - order transition states is given elsewhere.@xcite    the reaction rates @xmath17 can be estimated using @xmath18 from the calculated activation energy @xmath19 and a typical vibrational frequency @xmath20 corresponding to about 1000@xmath21    the femoco exhibits seven high - spin iron atoms antiferromagnetically coupled to each other .",
    "many different spin configurations may easily lead to metastable states in conventional collinear spin - polarized calculations .",
    "therefore , we used a noncollinear description of the spin density for our calculations . in a noncollinear description each one - electron wave function is a two - component spinor wave function.@xcite this method not only correctly describes real noncollinear spin states , which occur within the reaction mechanism , but also avoids artificial barriers between different spin configurations occurring in collinear calculations .",
    "our resulting spin distribution is therefore independent of the random starting conditions .",
    "such a dependence is a common problem of conventional ( collinear ) spin - polarized calculations for this system .",
    "we found that the spin ordering depends on subtle changes in the atomic structure .",
    "it also changes between different states of the reaction mechanism .",
    "the spin orderings encountered in our calculations are given in fig .",
    "2 , where we follow the notation introduced by lovell et al.@xcite noncollinear spin arrangements have been found , in this study , only for energetically unfavorable states , which is why we do not specify them further .",
    "the spin quantum number @xmath22 is specified alongside with the corresponding structures in figs .  3 and 4 .",
    "a spin with @xmath23 , for example , corresponds to a triplet .",
    "noncollinear states are indicated by a spin quantum number that differs from half - integer values .",
    "this corresponds , in analogy with the collinear expression , to the absolute value of the integrated spin density divided by @xmath24 .    ]    during the reaction , protons and electrons are transferred to the cofactor and the substrate . in this work we made the assumption that electrons and protons are transferred in a correlated way , i.e. , that one proton is transferred with each electron transfer .",
    "this assumption implies one of the two scenarios : either a reduction of the cofactor increases the proton affinity such that a proton transfer is induced , or , if the proton transfer precedes the electron transfer , it implies that the electron affinity is sufficiently enhanced by the positive charge next to the cofactor to induce an electron transfer to the cofactor .",
    "this is the main assumption in our work besides the accuracy of the density functionals and the neglect of the protein environment .",
    "this assumption has been shown to be valid for the cofactor before the binding of the substrate.@xcite    the energies of protons and electrons , which are consumed during the reaction , affect the overall reaction energy .",
    "thus we need to define a value that reflects their energies in the environment . for protons ,",
    "the relevant environment is the proton transfer channel , while for electrons it is expected to be the p - cluster .",
    "the exact energies can not be determined by theory alone .    as a consequence of our assumption that the reduction and protonation occur in a correlated manner , only the sum @xmath25 of the energies of protons and electrons is relevant for the relative energies of the intermediates .",
    "a range of possible values can be derived by comparing experimental x - ray and extended x - ray - absorption fine structure ( exafs ) data with our calculated geometries : we found indirect evidence for the cofactor being unprotonated in the resting state , while being protonated in the reduced state.@xcite therefore , @xmath25 is sufficiently high to drive protonation , that is , @xmath26mh@xmath27m@xmath28 . on the other hand ,",
    "no protonation occurs under the same conditions , but in the absence of mgatp .",
    "thus the chemical potential in the absence of mgatp , denoted by @xmath29 , must be sufficiently low not to drive protonation , that is , @xmath30mh@xmath27m@xmath28 . as two mgatp are hydrolyzed in each electron transfer ,",
    "the difference between the chemical potentials with and without mgatp is smaller than twice the energy of hydrolysis of mgatp , that is , @xmath31kj / mol.@xcite it is smaller because a fraction of the energy supplied by mgatp will be dissipated .",
    "therefore , we assume the lower bound for @xmath25 , that is , @xmath32mh@xmath27m@xmath28 , in our calculations .",
    "this is the most conservative assumption possible .",
    "a less conservative value would make the reactions including protonation more exothermic .",
    "previous studies@xcite made a different choice for @xmath25 , namely , @xmath33h@xmath34 . this would be the appropriate choice if the protons and electrons would be obtained from gaseous hydrogen . while the production of gaseous hydrogen 2h@xmath35h@xmath0 is energetically neutral with this choice , this reaction is exothermic by 71kj / mol when using our choice of @xmath36h@xmath37kj / mol .",
    "thus our reaction energies can be translated to the values for h@xmath0 reference by adding 35kj / mol per added hydrogen atom .",
    "we additionally list the reaction energies with h@xmath0 as the reference energy in parentheses after the values we obtain with our @xmath25 for all those energies were influenced by the choice of @xmath25 .    in our work",
    "we evaluate not only the energetics of the intermediates , but also the barriers for the transitions . to estimate the barriers for protonation , we need , however , to specify a proton donor , which models the proton channel .",
    "we used the ammonium ion to mimic the proton donor .",
    "note , however , that this choice only affects the barriers but not the relative energies of the intermediates .",
    "our finding that the barriers for protonations are small and will therefore be overcome easily indicates that the barriers for protonation are not relevant for the overall picture .",
    "the notation for the structures is chosen as follows .",

    "correspondingly , we find a large barrier for protonation of 79kj / mol from nh@xmath41 , which was used as the model for the proton donor .",
    "this barrier corresponds to a reaction rate of the order of 0.11s@xmath42 , which is substantially lower than the electron transfer rate .",
    "furthermore , as discussed below , _ a1 _ , the common starting configuration for both _",
    "b0 _ and _ b1 _ can be protonated with a negligible barrier at dinitrogen leading to _ b1_. since the pathways to _ b0 _ and _ b1 _ are in direct competition , protonation of the central ligand is kinetically hindered .",

    "if this structure is an artifact of our structural model , we investigated if this iron atom could form a complex bond to a nearby water molecule , which would restore a tetrahedral coordination of the fe atom .",
    "however , in our calculations including an additional water molecule , no significant complex bonds between the three - coordinate fe atom and a water are formed : for _ b0 _ an fe  o distance of 2.7 was calculated , which is substantially larger than typical complex bonds to fe .",
    "one may ask if the solvent effects affect the barrier to access _ b0_.",
    "we find that the interaction between an additional h@xmath0o molecule and the triangular fe atom in the initial state _ a1 _ and in the transition state is even weaker than in the final state _ b0 _ , expressed in even longer fe  o distances . from the absence of strong interactions",
    "we conclude that the large barrier is not appreciably influenced by the solvent .    ]",
    "a slow rate of formation does not rule out that the cofactor is accidentally trapped in this low - energy intermediate .",
    "therefore , we investigated the subsequent steps starting from _ b0_. we find that after one reduction the next proton attaches to the bridged dinitrogen , which is similar to the second most stable intermediate discussed below .",
    "however , upon protonation of dinitrogen , the proton at the central cluster is destabilized and is transferred to the unprotonated nitrogen atom of dinitrogen .",
    "the reaction energy for the internal proton transfer from the central ligand to the protonated dinitrogen is @xmath43kj / mol .",

    "the corresponding @xmath45 orbital lies close to the fermi level and its weight on dinitrogen is substantially smaller than in the corresponding orbital of the bridging mode . these differences between the bridged and axial binding modes are also reflected in the bond - length expansion and the reduction of the stretch frequency of the dinitrogen bond , and suggest a smaller activation of the axial binding mode .",
    "nevertheless , dinitrogen is readily protonated both in the axial and in the bridged binding mode after the transfer of one electron . compared to the gas phase ,",
    "the reaction energy for the first protonation is dramatically reduced from 164kj / mol ( 199kj / mol ) for the gas phase to 41kj / mol ( 76kj / mol ) at the femo cofactor in the bridged mode .",
    "interestingly , the most stable site for protonation is the central ligand .",
    "the resulting isomer is more stable by 37kj / mol than the one with protonated dinitrogen .",
    "however , this isomer is not considered relevant because protonation of the central ligand directly competes with protonation of dinitrogen .",
    "while protonation of the central ligand requires a large barrier of 79kj / mol to be overcome , protonation of dinitrogen proceeds nearly barrier - less .",
    "we attribute the large barrier to the breaking of the bond between the central ligand and one of the fe atoms , which changes its tetrahedral coordination to a trigonal planar one .",
    "even if the central ligand is protonated , the second proton is added to dinitrogen and induces an internal proton transfer from the central ligand to dinitrogen.@xcite thus even if the first proton binds to the central ligand , this step neither poisons the catalyst nor does it lead to an entirely different branch of the reaction cycle",
    ". this side branch may potentially be relevant at small turnover frequencies .",
    "the branch via protonation of the central ligand is reminiscent of the proposal by huniar _",
    "et al._,@xcite who propose complete protonation of the central ligand and its cleavage as ammonia , before dinitrogen binds to the cofactor . in their study ,",
    "the central cage is opened by a water molecule coordinating to one fe atom .",
    "additional calculations would be necessary to directly compare our results with their proposal",
    ". however , the latter seems to be in conflict with isotope exchange ( eseem / endor ) experiments@xcite that exclude an exchange of a central nitrogen ligand .",
    "a mechanism via dinitrogen bound to the mo site is inconsistent with our calculations .",
    "binding to the mo atom is substantially more endothermic than binding to the fe sites .",
    "dinitrogen bridging two fe atoms is part of the proposal by sellmann and co - workers@xcite .",
    "our model differs from theirs , in that all fe atoms remain tetrahedrally coordinated and in the high - spin state .",
    "we are not aware of any theoretical investigations of this system including the cofactor with its central ligand .",
    "the presence of the central ligand is crucial for the reaction mechanism of nitrogen fixation at the femo cofactor , and may explain why the mechanism has remained elusive for a long time .",
    "the main feature of the central ligand is its ability to form a variable number of bonds to the six fe atoms .",
    "the central ligand changes its coordination from sixfold to fivefold and fourfold .",
    "this allows other ligands such as nitrogen and sulfur to form and cleave bonds to the fe atoms without deviations from the preferred tetrahedral coordination of the latter .",
    "tetrahedral coordination seems to be a common structural principle to nearly all relevant intermediates of the reaction cycle .",
    "this is particularly apparent when dinitrogen binds:@xcite while the fe atom to which dinitrogen binds in the axial binding mode _",
    "a0 _ maintains its coordination shell by giving up its sulfur bridge , the bridged binding mode _ a1 _ would result in an unfavorable fivefold coordination of one fe atom , if the latter would not give up its bond to the central ligand .",
    "let us mention here some variants of the reaction steps discussed : our calculations do not allow to distinguish between fe3 and fe7 as potential docking sites of dinitrogen .",
    "we find that the axial binding mode _",
    "_ is more stable , that is , by 30kj / mol , on fe7 than on fe3 .",
    "the bridged mode accessed via the axial binding at fe7 is more stable by 14kj / mol than the other variant .",
    "we expect that these differences are sensitive to the environment of the cofactor : due to the large motion of the sulfur atom , the opening of the sh bridge may be strongly affected by the shape and the specific interactions of the cavity .",
    "thus , no conclusive answer regarding the initial binding site can be given at this point .",
    "the cofactor has an approximate threefold symmetry , which is broken by the ligands and the protein environment .",
    "as long as the protein environment is not taken into account , as in the present study , the energetics will proceed similar for all three equivalent orientations .",
    "nevertheless , the position of the proton channel in the protein indicates that nitrogen fixation proceeds near the iron atoms fe3 and fe7 .",
    "furthermore the cavity in this region provides sufficient space to accommodate nitrogen bound to an fe atom.@xcite",
    "we have studied the first protonation of dinitrogen at the cofactor on the basis of density - functional calculations .",
    "we made an effort to explore the phase space for the reaction without prejudice for one particular model of the mechanism .",
    "a large number of intermediates and the barriers between them have been explored and placed into perspective . while an unambiguous determination of this reaction step is not yet possible , three possible branches could be identified .",
    "one proceeds via dinitrogen in the bridged configuration , a second one proceeds via axially bound dinitrogen , and the third proceeds via protonation of the central ligand .",
    "the latter , however , is unlikely to play a role in the reaction cycle due to kinetic competition with direct protonation of the bridging dinitrogen .",
    "the activation of dinitrogen is discussed in detail .",
    "we acknowledge support by the hlrn for granting access to their ibm pseries 690 supercomputers . this work has benefited from the collaboration within the esf program on `` electronic structure calculations for elucidating the complex atomistic behaviour of solids and surfaces . ''"
