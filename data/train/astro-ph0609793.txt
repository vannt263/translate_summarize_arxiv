    "it is well known that the frequency and relative luminosity of h@xmath0 as a likely measure of chromospheric activity drops rapidly beyond spectral types m7  v ( kirkpatrick et al . 2000 , gizis et al . 2000 , mohanty & basri 2003 , west et al . 2004 ) .",

    "martn et al ( 1999 ) made the case that the strong emission lines , variable amount of optical veiling , and a claimed detection of the li  6707  doublet indicated that pc  0025 + 0447 is a substellar object less massive than 0.06m@xmath10 and younger than @xmath41  gyr .",
    "their detection of weak k  i and na  i resonance doublets indicated a low surface gravity .",
    "they argued , however , that the lack of an infrared excess and the fact that the h@xmath0 profile is not similar to classical t tauris suggests that chromospheric activity rather than an active accretion disk is the likely source of the intense emission .",
    "if the same scenario applies to 2 m  1237 + 6526 , this object could be a very low mass , young , very active brown dwarf .",

    "vrba et al . ( 2004 ) have published trigonometric parallaxes of 40 l and t dwarfs which permit the assessment of the absolute magnitude of 2 m  1237 + 6526 in comparison with t dwarfs of similar spectral type .",
    "its absolute @xmath13-band magnitude of 15.88@xmath120.13 makes it similar to , and even marginally fainter than , other t6-t7 dwarfs with parallax measurements .",

    "the reduced spex spectrum of 2 m  1237 + 6526 is shown in figure  1 , along with those of the t6.5 dwarfs sdss  j134646.45 - 003150.4 ( tsvetanov et al .",

    "while the threesome exhibit similar pseudo - continuum peaks typical of late t dwarfs at 1.27  @xmath21 , the emission line object shows a smaller peak at 1.57  @xmath21 and a very depressed continuum peak near 2.1  @xmath21 compared with the others .",
    "ch@xmath23 and h@xmath24o bands are prominent in the @xmath14 and @xmath25 bands where the last two peaks fall",
    ". however , pressure - induced h@xmath24 molecular opacity is very strong at @xmath25 and affects @xmath14 as well .",
    "precisely because of its strong dependence on pressure , this opacity should be more sensitive than those of the other two molecules to surface gravity and metallicity .",
    "the strong dependence of the k band peak on @xmath2 is demonstrated in fig .  3 of bbk .",
    "a decrease of the atmospheric metal abundance below solar metallicity also has a similar effect ( cf .",
    "saumon et al .  1994 ) .",
    "on the other hand , 2 m  1237 + 6526 has the highest y band ( @xmath41.05@xmath26 m ) peak of the three sources .",
    "the slope blueward of this peak is shaped largely by the pressure - broadened red wing of the 0.77  @xmath21 doublet . at higher photospheric pressures ( characteristic of high surface gravity and/or metal - deficient objects ) , the slope of this red wing steepens as the near - center wings deepen ( burrows & volobuyev 2003 ) .",
    "hence , the sharper 1.05  @xmath21 peak of 2 m  1237 + 6526 is consistent with the behavior of the @xmath25-band peak ; both result from either a high surface gravity or lower metallicity .",
    "the and h@xmath24 features thus provide evidence that 2 m  1237 + 6526 has the highest surface gravity and/or lowest metallicity of the three t dwarfs displayed in figure  1 .",
    "this also provides an explanation for why the m@xmath27 value is fainter than the comparison objects , and suggests that it has among the highest gravities of the late t dwarfs in the vrba et al .",
    "parallax sample .",
    "a higher than average gravity for a brown dwarf implies a relatively high mass and older age .",
    "subsolar metallicity can also imply a higher surface gravity .",
    "stellar interiors deficient in heavy elements generally have smaller radii ( i.e.  larger gravity ) at a given temperature , and theoretical calculations show that the same should be true for substellar entities ( burrows et al . 1993 ) .",
    "both scenarios imply that 2 m  1237 + 6526 is unlikely to be young , and may in fact be quite old .",
    "this hypothesis can be tested using the tools from bbk .",
    "bbk has demonstrated that a comparison of h@xmath24o and color ratio indices measured on the near infrared spectra of late - type t dwarfs to those measured on spectral models , after normalizing the latter to the well - characterized t7.5 brown dwarf companion gliese 570d ( burgasser et al .",
    "2000b ) , provides a means of disentangling the effects of t@xmath1 and surface gravity for these sources .",
    "these parameters can then be used to infer age and mass using evolutionary models or a measured bolometric luminosity .",
    "the technique described in bbk was used to estimate ages for sd  1346 - 0031 and sd  1758 + 4633 of 0.3 - 0.9 and 1.0 - 4.9 gyr , respectively .",
    "the spectral comparison of fig .",
    "1 suggests that 2 m  1237 + 6526 is older still .",
    "we implemented the bbk technique for the spectrum of 2 m  1237 + 6526 by comparing two pairs of indices ( h@xmath24o - j and k / h , h@xmath24o - h and k / j ) with two model sets ( burrows , sudarsky & hubeny 2005 ; allard et al .",
    "figure  2 display the resulting best fit t@xmath1 and @xmath2 phase spaces for this source , assuming solar metallicity and 10% uncertainty in the spectral indices .",
    "while there are slight differences between these comparisons , all four are consistent with high surface gravity ( @xmath2 = 5.25.5 cgs ) and low t@xmath1 ( 740860 k ) .",
    "the fit using the burrows et al .",
    "models and h@xmath24o - j and k / h indices ( the nominal set for bbk ) is quite similar to that for 2mass  j00345157 + 0523050 ( burgasser et al .  2004 ) , another t6.5 that exhibits strong @xmath25-band suppression and a large proper motion , for which bbk estimate an age of 3.46.9  gyr .",
    "as discussed above , subsolar metallicity can also lead to enhanced h@xmath24 absorption .",
    "hence , it is necessary to assess whether the spectrum of 2 m  1237 + 6526 could match that of a metal - poor brown dwarf .",
    "we repeated the parameter fit analysis using the h@xmath24o - j and k / h indices and subsolar metallicity models from burrows et al .  spanning [ m / h ] =",
    "-0.5 to 0 .",
    "results are shown in figure  3 . as [ m / h ]",
    "is lowered , the best fit t@xmath1 stays around 750 - 850  k , while the best fit @xmath2 generally decreases . at [ m / h ] = -0.5 ,",
    "the best fit @xmath2 has dropped a full dex from the solar abundance fit to 4.5 .",
    "there is a clear degeneracy between @xmath2 and [ m / h ] parameters based on this two - index fitting procedure .",
    "ideally , one would like to use a third index , specifically sensitive to metallicity or gravity , to break the degeneracy .",
    "however , the best candidate for such an index , the y / j ratio ( ratio between the y- and j - band pseudocontinuum flux peaks ) , is highly sensitive to the line broadening physics , for which more recent calculations ( burrows & volobuyev 2003 ) are not included in the burrows et al .",
    "subsolar metallicity models ( bbk ) . as an alternative",
    ", we compared absolute spectral fluxes for 2 m  1237 + 6526 to those of the burrows et al .",
    "models , since a more metal - poor ( less opacity ) and lower surface gravity ( larger radius ) object is overall more luminous . figure  4 compares the absolute flux calibrated spectrum for 2 m  1237 + 6526 to the best fitting [ m / h ] = 0 and -0.5 models from the index analysis .",
    "the data lie between these two extremes and are inconsistent with them at the 1@xmath28 flux level , suggesting that 2 m  1237 + 6526 is most likely to be slightly metal - poor ( [ m / h ] @xmath4 -0.2 ) brown dwarf with a moderate surface gravity ( @xmath2 @xmath4 5.0 ) .",
    "there are naturally several caveats to consider with this interpretation , including uncertainties in the t@xmath1 and @xmath2 determinations , systematic errors in the models and the possibility of excess light from a faint companion .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that this object does not exhibit the more pronounced metallicity features of the peculiar t6 2mass j09373487 + 2931409 ( burgasser et al .  2002b ; hereafter 2 m  0937 + 2931 ) , for which bbk derive [ m / h ] = -0.1 to -0.4 , argues for a metallicity closer to solar .",
    "the t@xmath1 and @xmath2 derived for 2 m  1237 + 6526 can be used to infer the mass and age for this source using the burrows et al .",
    "( 1997 ) evolutionary models . for solar metallicity , the four index analyses in fig .",
    "1 combined yield an age of 5 - 10 gyr and m = 0.0430.065 m@xmath5 .",
    "this is both old and relatively massive for a brown dwarf .",
    "the lowest metallicity fit ( [ m / h ] = -0.5 ) yields a significantly younger age ( @xmath40.4 gyr ) and lower mass ( @xmath40.015 m@xmath5 ) , but for the reasons discussed above this interpretation is not favored .",
    "rather , for @xmath29 and the best fit t@xmath1s ( 800850  k ) , 2 m  1237 + 6526 is likely to be older than 2  gyr and more massive than 0.035  m@xmath5 .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the deduced mass of this object from the estimated t@xmath1 and @xmath2 values and the measured bolometric luminosity ( vrba et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , which yield m = @xmath30 @xmath3 0.04 m@xmath5 , albeit with significant uncertainty .",
    "if 2 m  1237 + 6526 has a companion overfilling its roche lobe , we concluded in burgasser et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that this companion s mass must be @xmath663% that of the primary .",
    "hence , for a primary with mass 0.04  m@xmath5 ( 0.065  m@xmath5 ) at an age of 2  gyr ( 10  gyr ) , then the companion must have a mass @xmath60.025  m@xmath5 ( @xmath60.04  m@xmath5 ) and t@xmath1@xmath6650  k ( @xmath6550  k ) .",
    "the hypothesized semi - detached companion , under these conditions , must be substantially cooler than its primary , and also cooler than any currently - known t dwarf .",
    "could such a companion have been detected in @xmath31 3.68  @xmath21 observations of 2 m  1237 + 6526 ?",
    "we show in figure  5 a color magnitude diagram for the two most sensitive @xmath32 bands , the absolute 3.6  @xmath21 magnitude vs.  the [ 3.6][4.5 ] color for objects t5 and later with trigonometric parallaxes , including two known mid - t binaries with components of similar brightness .",

    "as discussed in patten et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the disagreement between the models and data in this plot likely arises from overestimated 4.5  @xmath21 fluxes in the models .",
    "this is likely due to underestimated abundances of co , that appears to be enhanced by vertical upwelling ( noll , geballe , & marley 1997 ; oppenheimer et al .  1998 ; saumon et al .",
    "absorption due to this molecule s fundamental band at @xmath44.67  @xmath21 probably causes the observed fluxes to be weaker than the models predict , and therefore the [ 3.6][4.5 ] colors to be bluer .",
    "trends in the data suggest a blue envelope of [ 3.6][4.5 ] colors that parallels similar trends in the models .",
    "this envelope , which we approximate as @xmath33-[4.5 ] \\geq -7.05 + 0.58m_{[3.6]}\\ ] ] over the range 14.0 @xmath6 @xmath34}$ ] @xmath6 15.3 , should trace out the oldest and most massive single brown dwarfs , as the models predict that lower surface gravities ( i.e. , younger ages ) yield redder colors .",
    "most of the t5t8 dwarfs from this sample lie close to the envelope ( with small color dispersion , although there is some spread in @xmath34}$ ] along the envelope amongst objects in a given spectral subclass , possibly due to classification uncertainties ) .",
    "2 m  1237 + 6526 , on the other hand , sits modestly above or redward of this envelope .",
    "as it is an apparently old source , this excess suggests the presence of a faint , unresolved companion .    by constraining the primary to lie on the the envelope line ( @xmath34 } \\approx$ ] 14.4 , [ 3.6][4.5 ] @xmath3 1.3 )  marked by a green circle ",
    "we show the effect of adding a companion with t@xmath1= 500  k , log g = 5.0 and solar composition , based on theoretical photometry calculated for us by a. burrows .",
    "this companion has @xmath34}$]= 17.28 , [ 3.6][4.5 ] = 3.12 .",
    "coadding the fluxes in each of the two bands places the combined - light binary at the position of the red circle ( @xmath34}$]= 14.33 , [ 3.6][4.5 ] = 1.58 ) .",
    "thus , if our speculation is correct that 2 m  1237 + 6526 has a cooler companion , it is probably more than 300  k cooler than its primary , which is consistent with the constraints placed on the companion by the interacting binary scenario .",
    "note also that both the t6p 2 m  0937 + 2931 and the t6.5 2mass j10475385 + 2124234 ( burgasser et al .",
    "1999 ; hereafter 2 m  1047 + 2124 ; not plotted in the figure as it has values nearly identical to 2 m  1237 + 6526 ) also lie redward of the proposed envelope .",
    "while it is possible that the latter source is young and has a low surface gravity , the former source has been shown to be an old , high surface gravity brown dwarf with subsolar metallicity ( bbk ) .",
    "since 2 m  1237 + 6526 also appears to be slightly metal - deficient , its red [ 3.6][4.5 ] color may instead be a metallicity effect .",
    "lower heavy element abundances would increase the atmospheric pressures , which might enhance the formation of ch@xmath23 while weakening co. the latter could enhance the 4.5  @xmath26 m flux , while the former could weaken the 3.6  @xmath26 m flux .",
    "thus , the @xmath32 colors of 2 m  1237 + 6526 can not unambiguously confirm the presence of a low - mass unresolved companion .",
    "on the basis of our spectral analysis , as well as the object s luminosity and kinematics , we conclude that 2 m  1237 + 6526 is likely to be a rather old , massive and slightly metal - poor brown dwarf .",
    "youthful activity , which is cited as the source for the emission properties of pc  0025 + 0047 , can not explain this t dwarf s persistent h@xmath0 emission .",
    "other possibilities , including accretion from a close companion , are worth further investigation .",
    "the `` tests '' of the double degenerate hypothesis involving a low rate of transfer have not been conclusive .",
    "the problem with searching for possible radial velocity variations was described in the introduction . the absence of large infrared variations sought in the burgasser et al .",
    "( 2002a ) study rules out only a limited phase space for the interacting binary model .",
    "the @xmath32 photometry suggests a [ 3.6][4.5 ] color excess which could result from the presence of an unresolved cool companion , but the excess may also be attributable to a lower metallicity .",
    "any companion would have to be appreciably lower in mass , and probably at least 300  k cooler . generally speaking , as model atmospheres are improved to predict more accurate 4.5  @xmath26 m fluxes , including the dependence on metallicity , searching for an excess in this band may result in the detection of unresolved companions later in type than any currently - known t dwarf .",
