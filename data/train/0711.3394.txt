    "the two local algebras represent the observations that can be made within alice s and bob s laboratories , respectively .",
    "the essential requirement is that each measurement performed by bob can not disturb the measurements made within alice s laboratory .",
    "therefore , each of alice s operators has to commute with all of bob s operators .",
    "once a bipartite system is fixed by choosing the local algebras , the notion of entanglement can be introduced _ relatively to this choice _ :",
    "product states are characterized by the property that the expectation values of a product of one of alice s operators and one of bob s operators factorize . taking the convex hull of all product states yields",

    "@xcite , we focus here on the `` converse '' of separability , namely the characterization of maximally entangled fermions .",
    "when dealing with fermions , the main issue is that , due to the canonical aniticommutation relations ( car ) of fermi fields , generic operators of alice and bob do not commute among each other .",
    "as we shall see , the standard bipartite structure discussed above can be restored either by restricting the analysis to even products of fermi fields , as mainly done in this paper , or by introducing a twisted tensor product structure which automatically accounts for the alternating signs related to the commutation of fermi fields belonging to different subsystems .",
    "the restriction to even products of fermi fields corresponds to the requirement that physical observables preserve the parity of the particle number .",
    "since correlation experiments for the detection of entanglement are built from observables that belong to the local subsystems of alice and bob , it is natural to restrict the analysis to operators which preserve not only the global parity , but also the local parity . in mathematical terms",
    ", we will then exploit the restriction to the even - even part of the global algebra .",
    "consequently , we shall speak of _ accessible _ entanglement , relative to the restriction under consideration .",
    "clearly , once the even - even part of the algebra is considered , operators belonging to different subsystems commute among each other , giving rise to a tensor product structure analog to the qubit case .",
    "as far as this restriction is concerned , our main result is the full characterization of quasifree ( i.e. , gaussian ) maximally entangled states .",
    "we prove that , in order to be maximally entangled , a fermionic quasifree state must have a covariance matrix of a well - defined form , which is unique up to local bogolubov transformations .",
    "this analysis obviously requires a precise definition of fermionic maximally entangled states in the presence of the above restriction . to this purpose",
    ", we exploit the conservation of local parity to further decompose the operator algebra .",
    "indeed , it turns out that the structure of alice s and bob s observable algebras corresponds to the following situation : alice possesses a direct sum of matrix algebras of the form @xmath0 whereas bob possesses the algebra @xmath1 , where @xmath2 are full matrix algebras . here , the label @xmath3 refers to the number parity of the two subspaces ( four combinations are possible , i.e. , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 correspond to even and odd , respectively ) , and , assuming that both alice and bob own @xmath7 fermionic modes , one has @xmath8 . the direct sum structure of the observable algebras can be interpreted as a _ super - selection rule _",
    ", where the label @xmath3 plays the role of a conserved charge or quantum number .",
    "therefore , we are faced here with the issue of entanglement in the presence of a super - selection rule .",
    "while correlation experiments for the detection of entanglement only involve observables belonging to the quasi - local observable algebra given by @xmath9 , the fermionic state @xmath10 under investigation can be prepared in a more general way and can be thought of as belonging to the global observable algebra .",
    "the restriction of @xmath10 to the even - even part of the algebra , i.e. , to the quasi - local observable algebra , is given by a density operator @xmath11 of block - diagonal form , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a normalized probability distribution and @xmath14 is a density matrix in @xmath15 .",
    "pure states are given by rank - one projections @xmath16 in @xmath15 and the situation is effectively the same as for a simple tensor product since there is only one non - zero term that contributes to the direct sum .",
    "a suitable entanglement measure is the entropy of entanglement @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the reduced density matrix on alice s subblock @xmath19 and @xmath20 $ ] is the von neumann entropy .",
    "if we consider a density operator of the form @xmath21 with rank - one projections @xmath16 , then ( due to the superselection rule ) this is the _",
    "unique _ convex decomposition of @xmath11 into pure states . for this class of states",
    "the _ entanglement of formation _",
    "@xmath22 can easily be computed .",
    "it is just given by the mean value of the entropy of entanglement of each block , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "now we can ask for those states which maximize the entanglement of formation .",
    "they are given by all density operators of the form @xmath21 where @xmath16 is a projection onto a maximally entangled vector .",
    "for all these states we find for the entanglement of formation the maximal value @xmath24 .",
    "this is precisely the notion of maximal entanglement that we apply here to the investigation of entanglement in fermionic systems .",
    "the discussion of fermionic entanglement can also be applied to investigate entanglement in spin chain systems with the help of the jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "then , preservation of global parity corresponds to preservation of total magnetization . since magnetization",
    "does not give rise to superselection rules , a fermionic system formally arising from the jordan - wigner transformation of a spin chain is not necessarily subject to the physical constraints discussed above . in particular",
    ", the two local observable algebras are not restricted to the even part , given by even products of fermi fields , and their commutativity is not guaranteed .",
    "in such a context , it is useful to consider the _ twisted _ tensor product structure mentioned above , which takes into account the anticommutation relations of fermi fields similarly to the jordan - wigner transformation .",

    "@xcite for general quasifree completely positive maps ) .",
    "we also discuss a one - parameter group of ( global ) bogolubov transformations ( which can be interpreted as the unitary time evolution due to a proper interaction ) mapping a product state into a maximally entangled fermion state for a suitable value of the associated parameter ( time ) . as a further example",

    ", this representation is given on the @xmath28-dimensional hilbert space @xmath29 that is spanned by basis vectors @xmath30 , labeled by binary strings of length four , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "the 16-dimensional hilbert space @xmath29 can be decomposed into a direct sum of four 4-dimensional subspaces .",
    "each vector @xmath32 can be represented by a block decomposition @xmath33 where the four block vectors @xmath34 , with @xmath35 , are simultaneous eigenvectors of the parity operators of both subsystems . for example , @xmath36 .",

    "putting all these together , a general operator of alice s local observable algebra can be represented by the block matrix @xmath40 with @xmath41 matrices @xmath42 . by an analogous reasoning ,",
    "a general operator that belongs to bob s local observable algebra has the form @xmath43 with @xmath41 matrices @xmath44 .",
    "this representation of the local observable algebras shows directly the fact that alice s operators commute with bob s .",
    "we suggest here a notion for maximally entangled bipartite fermion states which is related to the maximization of the entanglement of formation . in view of our example above",
    ", we declare a state @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath35 , are projections onto maximally entangled vectors @xmath47 , to be maximally entangled .",
    "the example given above , is concerned with two fermion modes per site ( two for alice and two for bob ) and the total dimension of the hilbert space is @xmath48 . more generally , if each of alice and bob possesses @xmath7 fermion modes , then the dimension is @xmath49 .",
    "therefore the dimension of the hilbert space of the system increases exponentially with the number of fermion modes .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to find ways of treating at least some aspects of large fermion systems without actually having to write out state vectors component by component . here",
    "the class of _ quasifree fermion states _ is a suitable choice .",

    "the ordering of the entries of @xmath70 is chosen in agreement with araki s selfdual formalism , which is explained in the next section .",
    "the main result of this paper gives a complete characterization of maximally entangled quasifree states for the case that alice and bob possess an arbitrary number @xmath7 of fermion modes by giving an explicit form of the covariance matrix . for two modes per site , the standard example for a maximally entangled fermion state is given by the covariance operator @xmath72 where here and in the following the symbol @xmath73 denotes the @xmath61 identity matrix .",
    "it is not difficult to check that @xmath74 is a projection which implies that the quasifree state @xmath75 is pure _ on the full fermion algebra _ that is generated by @xmath76 .",
