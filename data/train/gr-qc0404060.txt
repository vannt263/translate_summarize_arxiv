    "in the paper [ 8 ] was presented a new model of gravitational theory , which yields to the same experimental results for motion of a particle in a gravitational field predicted by the general relativity ( gr ) and which are experimentally verified . in this paper that theory is studied now in many details and a lot new results are presented . in this section",
    "will be repeated the basic concepts of the theory given in [ 8 ] with some improvements .",
    "we convenient to use that @xmath1 for the time coordinate and orthogonal matrix @xmath2 with complex elements will mean that @xmath3 .    first we underline the main difference between the gr and the proposed theory",
    "let us start from the metric in gr @xmath4 where @xmath5 can approximately be written in the form @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the gravitational potential , for example @xmath8 in case of gravitation of a spherical body .",
    "note that the coefficients @xmath5 may not be determined very precisely like in the gr , because we shall use them for metric proportions , but not for equations of motion .",
    "thus , the expressions of type @xmath9 and less are neglected .",
    "hence , the experiments for the red shift of the spectral lines and the shapiro time delay , where the christoffel symbols are not used , are explained in the same way like in the gr .",
    "the above coordinates @xmath10 will be called _",
    "ordinary coordinates_. in order to consider the equations of motion , we introduce the so called _ orthonormal coordinates _",
    "@xmath11 such that @xmath12 @xmath13 further we shall deal mainly with orthonormal coordinates , otherwise it will be emphasized that the coordinates are ordinary . according to the ordinary coordinates ,",
    "the velocity of the light is equal to @xmath14 , like in gr , while according to the orthonormal coordinates the velocity of the light is universal constant .",
    "indeed , according to the orthonormal coordinates the space - time in an infinitesimally small neighborhood is flat like in the special theory of relativity ( str ) , and hence the proposed theory will be called infinitesimally locally lorentzian theory of gravitation ( illtg ) .",
    "note that illtg , using orthonormal coordinates , does not describes only gravitation , but also inertial forces ( see ref .",
    "the ordinary coordinates @xmath10 from illtg are analogous to the usual coordinates @xmath11 from the gr , while the orthonormal coordinates from illtg mean that the observer is far from gravitation , where the metric is like in the str .    instead of the metric @xmath5 we can use only a potential @xmath15 . for example , this potential caused by a spherical body with mass m",
    ", whose center is at the coordinate origin and which rests with respect to the chosen coordinate system is @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the equations ( 1.1 ) will be replaced by @xmath17 further we shall present the basic results about the equations of motion in orthonormal coordinates , and naturally then we should return back in ordinary coordinates as natural .",
    "this transformation in an infinitesimally small neighborhood is always possible , but in large we can deal with the nonholonomic coordinates .    if two gravitational fields are given by the gravitational potentials @xmath18 and @xmath19 , then the superposition of those two fields is a gravitational field with potential @xmath20",
    "in special case if @xmath21 is a constant in the space - time , then the motions of particles should be the same like for the field given by @xmath22 .",
    "illtg is built using a 4-vector potential @xmath23 .",
    "if the magnitude of this vector changes but its direction is a constant , then there exists a gravitational field and the source of gravitational field is moving with 4-vector of velocity @xmath24 ; if the direction of this vector changes but its magnitude is a constant , then there exist some inertial forces , for example centrifugal .",
    "this 4-vector field can be written in the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a 3-vector of velocity and @xmath27 is the gravitational potential .",

    "further we introduce a non - linear connection induced by the 4-vector potential @xmath23 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath36 the form of connection in the direction of the unit vector @xmath37 .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for the metric tensor @xmath38 to be parallel , is @xmath39    now let us introduce the following tensor @xmath40 if we denote by @xmath41 the 4-vector of velocity of the moving particle , i.e. @xmath42 one can easily verify that the following simple equations @xmath43 which are analogous to the lorentz force in the theory of electromagnetism , contain inertial accelerations ( coriolis acceleration , centrifugal and transversely acceleration ) and gravitation acceleration for newton approach . in order to obtain a precise theory , we consider the following two tensors @xmath44 @xmath45 these two tensors together with @xmath46 are invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a constant",

    "first we should remember that in case of gravitation it is @xmath84 , and remember that @xmath548 if the particle moves on a circle with velocity @xmath266 .",
    "hence it is better to write @xmath549 .",
    "now , let us consider the potential @xmath27 , when an electron is moving around the core of the atom . if its velocity is approximately @xmath550 , then @xmath551 .",
    "if we consider another particle instead of electron , for example a non charged particle , since the gravitational force is much smaller than the coulon s force , its velocity around the core will be much smaller and hence @xmath15 will be almost 1 .",
    "hence the conclusion that _ the potential @xmath15 depends on the nature of the particle _ , i.e. it is not the same for all particles as it was in the previous sections .",
    "let us calculate the potential @xmath15 for the proton near the core of the hydrogen on a distance @xmath552 cm .",

    "applying the equations of motion ( 6.17 ) , or simply the equations ( 2.18 ) or ( 2.19 ) with the potential ( 6.15 ) or ( 6.18 ) , we shall obtain the required periastron shift .",
    "let @xmath483 be the mass of the pulsar and @xmath30 be the mass of its companion .",
    "let us choose a coordinate system having origin at their barycenter , in the moment when they are at the periastron .",
    "let @xmath563 be the coordinates of the pulsar , and let @xmath564 be the coordinates of its companion .",
    "the gravitational potential at @xmath563 caused by the companion is given by ( sec .",
    "6 ) @xmath565 where @xmath566 . since the following potentials @xmath567 and @xmath568 do not differ from @xmath569 up to @xmath570 , the same result obtains up to @xmath570 if we use alternatively the potential @xmath571 or @xmath572 .",
    "let us denote the 4-vector of velocity of the pulsar by @xmath573 and the 4-vector of velocity of its companion by @xmath574    using the potential @xmath575 we can calculate the components @xmath576 , which appear in ( 2.18 ) .",
    "it is convenient to use the notation @xmath577 and @xmath578 .",
    "let us put @xmath579 and @xmath580 .",
    "then , up to @xmath570 we have @xmath581 @xmath582 i.e. @xmath583 and analogously @xmath584 @xmath585 @xmath586 @xmath587 in the last equality it is used that @xmath588 , @xmath589 , @xmath590 and @xmath591 .",
    "we may assume approximately that @xmath592 , because the barycenter is very close to coordinate origin .",
    "hence @xmath593 and @xmath594 .    by replacing these values in ( 2.18a , b ) , and neglecting the terms of order @xmath9 and smaller , we obtain @xmath595 @xmath596    these equations are analogous to ( 2.2 ) , and continuing to deal like for the perihelion shift in section 2 , we obtain @xmath597 @xmath598 @xmath599 @xmath600 where @xmath601 .",
    "the solution of this differential equation is given by @xmath602 , \\eqno{(7.3)}\\ ] ] and hence @xmath603 .\\ ] ] analogously to ( 2.5 ) , now we have @xmath604 .\\eqno{(7.4)}\\ ] ]    further we should find @xmath266 as a function of @xmath146 or @xmath310 .",
    "we can replace @xmath605 into the terms of @xmath606 and @xmath607 . according to this approximation , the solution of ( 2.18d )",
    "is given by @xmath608 @xmath609 hence after some transformations we can express @xmath121 as a function of @xmath167 up to @xmath570 , and obtain @xmath610 note that the constant of integration @xmath611 is neglected in the last formula , because one can verify that it has no role in the final formula for the periastron shift , like for the perihelion shift in section 2 .",
    "substituting this value of @xmath121 into ( 7.4 ) we obtain @xmath612 where @xmath613 since @xmath614 , where @xmath615 is the semi - major axis of the relative orbit and @xmath60 is the orbit period , we obtain @xmath616 and analogously to the calculations for the perihelion shift in section 2 , for the periastron shift in this case we obtain @xmath617 using that @xmath618 , we obtain finally @xmath619 this value ( 7.6 ) of the periastron shift is the same which predicts the gr .",
    "note that if we did not take into account that the pulsar with mass @xmath483 has an influence on the gravitation from the companion with mass @xmath30 , i.e. if we omit the expression @xmath620 in ( 7.1 ) , then instead of ( 7.6 ) the periastron shift would be @xmath621 where @xmath622 is given by ( 7.6 ) .",
    "it means that the companion star participates with @xmath623 in the total periastron shift given by ( 7.6 ) .",
    "symmetrically , the pulsar with mass @xmath483 , participates with @xmath624 in the total periastron shift .",
    "now let us assume that @xmath625 then the previous calculation leads that the periastron shift instead of ( 7.6 ) is equal to @xmath626 since the angle @xmath622 should be symmetric with respect to @xmath30 and @xmath483 , it must be @xmath627 , i.e. @xmath628 . but",
    "this is satisfied if and only if the `` correcting multiplier '' is @xmath518 .",
    "further , in that case @xmath629 and it depends on the total mass @xmath630 , but not on @xmath30 and @xmath483 separately . finally , @xmath631 must be 1 ( and hence @xmath632 ) in order to be @xmath633 for @xmath634 .",
    "note that the formula @xmath635 does not depend on @xmath631 and @xmath636 .",
    "thus , ( 7.3 ) for the pulsar s orbit can be important test for illtg , like the tests 1 and 2 in section 5 .",
    "for example , from ( 7.3 ) it just follows that @xmath637 where @xmath638 is the semi - major axis of the pulsar s orbit .",
    "using the recent data about the hulse - taylor pulsar psr b1913 + 16 [ 12 ] , we get @xmath639    probably using the fact that @xmath622 should be a symmetric function with respect to @xmath30 and @xmath483 , or some similar conditions , it can be used to obtain the gravitational potential in the form @xmath640 and hence to obtain the post - newtonian approximations of 2,3 , ... order . for post - newtonian approximations of order 2,5 ; 3,5 ; ... should be considered the multiple moments .",
    "the representations in sections 1 - 7 would not be complete if we skip some cosmological consequences considered in [ 10,11 ] . in this section the basic arguments of [ 10 ] from viewpoint of illtg will be considered .    in [ 10 ]",
    "is given a new view of the hubble law , showing that the hubble red shift and the anomalous acceleration of pioneer spacecraft ( see ref .",
    "[ 1,2,3 ] ) are consequences of the change of the potential in the universe .",
    "it is detected red shift such that @xmath641 , and replacing @xmath642 , indeed it is observed that @xmath643 on the other hand , if the potential changes linearly with the time , after time @xmath644 we have additional potential @xmath645 , and hence we have a frequency shift such that @xmath646 we should remark here that the sign of the potential @xmath7 is such that near to the spherical gravitational body the potential @xmath647 is larger than the potential far from gravitation @xmath648 .    comparing the formulas ( 8.1 ) and ( 8.2 ) we obtain @xmath649 the change of the potential energy in the universe is probably related with the dark energy , which is about 67% of the whole energy in the universe [ 6 ] .",
    "some recent measurements show that @xmath650 is about 72 km / s / mpc , but we shall accept value of about 82 km / s / mpc .      on the other hand , in the last decades are considered the motions of the spacecraft pioneer 10 and 11 , by comparing the initial frequency of a signal which is sent from the earth to the spacecraft and the frequency of the signal which comes back .",
    "the frequency of the received signal on the earth does not fit with the predicted frequency modeled by using the doppler effect , the position and motion of the spacecraft using the gr and a lot of perturbations [ 3 ] .",
    "the observations show that appears almost a constant apparent unmodeled acceleration @xmath654cm / s@xmath655 which seems to act to the spacecraft toward the sun .",
    "the acceleration @xmath656 is introduced by formula ( 15 ) in [ 3 ] , i.e. @xmath657_{dsn } = -\\nu_0{2a_pt\\over c},\\ ; \\ ; \\hbox { where}\\ ; \\ ; \\nu_{model}= \\nu_0\\bigl [ 1 - 2{v_{model}(t)\\over c}\\bigr ] , \\eqno{(8.4)}\\ ] ] where @xmath658 is the reference frequency , the factor 2 is because of two way data , @xmath659 is the modeled velocity of the spacecraft due to the gravitational and other forces , and @xmath660 is frequency of the re - transmitted signal observed by dsn antennae .",
    "after time @xmath661 has been detected a small blue shift on the top of the red shift caused by the motion of the spacecraft outwards the sun .",
    "form ( 8.4 ) , an unexplained blue shift @xmath662 is detected , where @xmath661 is the time of the light signal in two directions . without using the acceleration @xmath656 , the anomalous frequency shift can be interpreted by `` clock acceleration '' @xmath663s / s@xmath655 [ 3 ] .",
    "this causes just the blue shift given by ( 8.5 ) .",
    "this model assumes that the time is uniform , but there is only technical problem with the clocks .",
    "although this model gives good explanations for both frequency shift and the trajectories , it is rejected [ 3 ] .",
    "many people have noticed that the acceleration @xmath656 and the hubble constant @xmath650 are related by [ 3 ] @xmath664 indeed , if we assume that @xmath650=82km / s / mpc , then from ( 8.6 ) it follows @xmath665cm / s@xmath655 .",
    "thus we assumed that @xmath650=82km / s / mpc .",
    "now we shall explain the apparent acceleration @xmath656 connected with the frequency shift , according to illtg .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the orthonormal coordinates and denote by @xmath10 ordinary coordinates where there is time dependent gravitational potential @xmath666 .",
    "according to ( 1.1 ) , where @xmath667 , we have the following equalities @xmath668 @xmath669    _ remark . _",
    "note that it is sufficient in this section to assume that ( 8.7 ) are satisfied .",
    "then it is not necessary to speak about the time dependent gravitational potential .",
    "the coefficients @xmath670 and @xmath671 in ( 8.7 ) should be exponential functions , but neglecting @xmath672 and smaller quantities we accept these linear functions .",
    "if we use orthonormal coordinates @xmath11 , then the motion of the spacecraft does not depend on the time dependent potential @xmath673 .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that the tensor @xmath46 does not depend on this potential , and hence the motion of the particles ( 2.2 ) does not depend on the time dependent potential , which means that @xmath674 , if we consider only the time dependent potential . using the equalities ( 8.7 ) , ( 2.2 ) and ( 8.6 )",
    "we have an additional 3-acceleration @xmath675 in the explanation of the shift frequency of pioneers , the first component @xmath676 is smaller , compared with the second and main component @xmath677    we shall explain why it is measured the blue shift given by ( 8.5 ) , instead of the red shift like in ( 8.1 ) .",
    "it will be explained without using the acceleration ( 8.8 ) , but only the definition ( 8.4 ) where @xmath656 is introduced , and our model of time dependent gravitational potential .",
    "let @xmath678 be the distance from the spacecraft to the dsn antenna .",
    "let us calculate @xmath679 . according to our model , neglecting the terms containing @xmath672 , this expression is equal to @xmath680 where the expression @xmath681 corresponds to the hubble red shift from ( 8.2 ) . on the other side , according to ( 8.4 ) , where @xmath659 it determined without using the hubble constant @xmath650 , we have @xmath682 from the last two equalities we are able to find the expression for @xmath656 @xmath683 using that @xmath684 according to ( 8.7 ) , we obtain finally @xmath685 the equality ( 8.9 ) gives the required expression of the acceleration @xmath656 .",
    "now we are not able to determine the initial value of @xmath375 , i.e. when we should start to measure the time @xmath375 in ( 8.9 ) .",
    "it depends on the estimation of the initial values for the motion of the spacecraft , i.e. it depends on the departure of the real initial values .",
    "thus , for different spacecraft are obtained close but different values of @xmath656 .",
    "note also that for each initial value of @xmath375 , when @xmath375 tends to infinity ( or @xmath146 tends to infinity ) , then @xmath656 tends to @xmath686 .",
    "in an ideal case , if the experiment is done in an inertial system , then @xmath687 is a constant velocity and then @xmath688 .",
    "the change of the gravitational potential causes slight changes in the results of the known experiments about gr , but they are negligible .",
    "the change of the results in the test of shapiro time delay is negligible if we consider radio signals on short distances like in the solar system .",
    "indeed , the change of the potential in the universe is about @xmath689cm@xmath655/s@xmath655 each second , while the gravitational potential on 1au from the sun is equal to @xmath691km@xmath655/s@xmath692cm@xmath655/s@xmath655 .",
    "this potential difference will be achieved from the universe after 118 years , which is too long compared with the time needed for an experiment about shapiro time delay .",
    "the change of the deflection of the light rays near the sun is completely negligible up to @xmath570 .",
    "the angle between two perihelions is changed additionally of order @xmath693 , where @xmath694 is the orbit period of the planet and @xmath135 is the eccentricity of the elliptic orbit .",
    "this change of the angle is negligible with respect to the measured angle @xmath695 . note that if we replace @xmath7 by @xmath696 @xmath697 in the metric of gr @xmath698 the additional acceleration is not convenient",
    "the situation becomes much worse if @xmath337 is very large .",
    "while the newton s theory is invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath699 , and illtg is invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath700 , gr does not posses similar property .",
    "the equations of motion are unchanged if we replace the metric @xmath5 by @xmath701 , but it can not be correlated with the change of the gravitational potential .",
