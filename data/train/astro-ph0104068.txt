    "the release of energy that occurs during galaxy formation can have important consequences .",
    "we present 3d gas dynamical simulations of the effect of energy release by supernovae ( sne ) on the evolution of the halo in which the explosions take place , the surrounding large - scale structure , and the igm .",
    "structure formation from gaussian random noise is highly anisotropic , favoring pancakes and filaments over quasi - spherical objects .",
    "however , pancake fragmentation results in the formation of quasi - spherical halos@xcite with density profiles similar to the universal profile@xcite found in cdm simulations .",
    "this suggests that pancake fragmentation may be used to study galaxy formation .",
    "this provides a good compromise between simulations of structure formation in cdm models , with limited resolution , and those of isolated virialized objects , which ignore cosmological initial and boundary conditions .",
    "we use our @xmath0 method to simulate the formation of a halo at the intersection of two filaments in the plane of a cosmological pancake which collapses at scale factor @xmath1 , in an @xmath2 universe with baryon fraction @xmath3 ( see @xcite for further description ) .",
    "these simulations also describe early galaxy formation in a flat , @xmath4cdm model .",
    "the explosion is induced at scale factor @xmath5 , when the central gas density first exceeds @xmath6 , by boosting the thermal energy of this central gas to the level @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the total thermal energy of gas in the halo , for four cases : @xmath9 , 10 , 100 , and 1000 .",
    "figure 1 shows the pancake - filament - halo structure at @xmath10 , with and without explosions .",
    "for all cases , the dark matter distribution is essentially the same as the gas distribution for @xmath9 .",
    "the pancake and filaments ensure that a highly anisotropic explosion results , channelling the energy and mass ejection along the symmetry axis .",
    "the ability of explosions to eject metal - enriched gas depends on @xmath11 . for @xmath12 , relatively little gas",
    "is blown out of the halo , and is quickly re - accreted .",
    "for @xmath13 , most of the halo gas is blown out . however , as shown in figure  2 , infall along the pancake plane continues despite the explosion and replenishes the ejected halo gas very efficiently , although the final gas fraction @xmath14 is below the cosmic mean value by an amount which increases with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "even the most energetic explosions fail to disturb the pancake and filaments .",
    "each dimensionless , scale - free simulation for a given @xmath11 can be applied to any particular halo mass @xmath15 at any epoch by adjusting the values of @xmath16 ( the wavelength of the primary pancake ) and collapse redshift @xmath17 when converting to physical units",
    ". we can also use milky way ( mw ) star formation efficiencies and imf to estimate a typical value @xmath18 of the explosion parameter @xmath11 , for each @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath19 is required to eject gas and metals into the igm .",
    "this matches mw efficiencies only for @xmath20 , for both cluster - normalized scdm ( i.e. @xmath21 ) and _",
    "cobe_-normalized @xmath4cdm ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) ( i.e. @xmath25 ) .",
    "however , gas replenishment by continued infall may enable a single halo to contribute multiple outbursts .",
    "halos @xmath26 form early enough to cause heavy element distribution prior to @xmath27 . only the smallest mass objects , however , can expect to do so if limited to mw efficiencies .",
    "such small mass halos are also the ones which are most likely to form early enough that they may explode _ before _ the reionization of the igm is complete , after which the enhanced igm pressure inhibits gas ejection . otherwise efficiencies greatly exceeding mw values are required .",
    "a final determination of the success or failure of heavy element distribution by sn explosions in low - mass halos forming at high redshift will depend sensitively on the efficiencies of star formation and sn energy release , and the relative timing of these explosions versus universal reionization .",
    "our results suggest that heavy element distribution at the observed level of @xmath28 solar in the igm could have been accomplished most efficiently by low - mass objects prior to the completion of universal reionization .",
