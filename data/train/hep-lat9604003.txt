    "the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is one of the most important dynamical properties of qcd which shapes the hadronic spectrum .",
    "a great deal of understanding of this nonperturbative phenomenon at zero and finite temperature has been achieved by various methods @xcite . in particular",
    ", we expect that the chiral symmetry is restored above a certain critical temperature .",
    "the study of this new chirally symmetric phase of hot qcd is one of the primary objectives of heavy ion colliders .",
    "in contrast , the behavior of qcd at large baryon density ( conditions which can arise in the heavy ion colliders or in neutron stars ) is not well understood .",
    "the main puzzle has for a long time been a contradiction between a straightforward physical expectation and numerical results from quenched lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "simulations with dynamical quarks , on the other hand , are very inefficient at finite @xmath0  the fermion determinant is complex .",
    "the puzzle concerns the dependence of the order parameter ( the chiral condensate @xmath5 ) on the baryon chemical potential .",
    "a non - analytical change in the value of @xmath5 should occur when @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mass of the lightest baryon . at this point",
    "the production of baryons becomes energetically favorable . for smaller @xmath0 the value of @xmath5",
    "is nonzero .",
    "in contrast , lattice simulations of quenched qcd indicate that @xmath8 ( at zero bare quark mass ) , i.e. , the chiral condensate vanishes if @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a number of possible explanations has been suggested @xcite .",
    "however , the answer to this puzzle remains unclear .",
    "this work was motivated by a desire to shed some light on this question using the random matrix approach which received considerable interest recently @xcite .",
    "it is based on the idea that , for the purpose of studying chiral symmetry breaking , fluctuations of the dirac operator in the background of the gauge fields can be approximated by purely random fluctuations of its matrix elements in a suitable basis .",
    "for example , in the instanton liquid model this basis can be formed from the dirac zero modes for individual ( anti)instantons , which due to overlaps form a band of small eigenvalues responsible for the chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "a similar random matrix approach is fruitful in the studies of spectra of systems with a high level of disorder , such as spectra of heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "introduction of chemical potential into such a model of chiral symmetry breaking is straightforward .",
    "the resulting dirac matrix ( times @xmath9 ) is _ non - hermitian_. thus the eigenvalues lie in the complex plane rather than on a line .",
    "such random matrix models have not received much attention previously and this study is a step in an unexplored direction .    in this letter",
    "we show how to solve such a model in the thermodynamic limit and discuss the implications .",
    "in order to study chiral symmetry breaking we shall calculate the resolvent of the dirac operator @xmath10 : @xmath11 as a function of the bare quark mass @xmath12 which we take to be a complex variable @xmath13 .",
    "the average is over fluctuations of the random matrix elements of @xmath10 .",
    "it should be obvious that @xmath14 is the same as @xmath5 .",
    "the resolvent can be expressed through the average eigenvalue density @xmath15 : @xmath16 a vector @xmath17 is the electric field created by the charge distribution @xmath15 .",
    "this makes the inversion of ( [ grho ] ) obvious : @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "analytical properties of @xmath14 are very closely related to the chiral symmetry breaking . from ( [ rhog ] )",
    "we see that @xmath15 vanishes if the function @xmath14 is holomorphic .",
    "a discontinuity of @xmath14 along a cut going through @xmath20 is the signature of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking : @xmath21 .",
    "this observation together with  ( [ rhog ] ) leads to the banks - casher relation @xcite : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the density per _ length _ on the cut at @xmath20 .",
    "however , ( [ rhog ] ) is more general and can be applied to a case when the non - analyticity is not in the form of a cut but occupies a 2-dimensional patch , which is the case in our model .",
    "the matrix @xmath10 has the form : @xmath24 where we added the chemical potential term @xmath25 to the dirac matrix @xcite .",
    "the @xmath26 matrix elements of @xmath27 are independently distributed complex gaussian random variables : @xmath28 .",
    "the unit of mass in the model is set by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of small eigenvalues in a unit volume ( instanton density  @xcite ) and @xmath31 is the chiral condensate at @xmath32 , @xmath33 .    in order to find the resolvent ( [ g ] ) we introduce @xmath34 quark fields ( replicas ) and calculate : @xmath35 this quantity continued to @xmath36 ( quenched limit ) becomes : @xmath37 from which we find @xmath14 : @xmath38 the trace in ( [ g ] ) is normalized as @xmath39 .",
    "following the electrostatic analogy of the previous section one can view re@xmath40 as the scalar potential for @xmath41 .",
    "using hubbard - stratonovitch transformation we obtain : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an auxiliary complex @xmath44 matrix field . for large @xmath45 the calculation of the integral amounts to finding its saddle point .",
    "if we assume that the replica symmetry is not broken ( i.e. , @xmath43 is proportional to a unit matrix ) we arrive at the saddle point equation : @xmath46,\\ ] ] the complex value of @xmath43 in ( [ a ] ) is the analytical continuation of the real part of the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath43 in ( 8) . the imaginary part is zero in the saddle point .",
    "the solution of this cubic equation is straightforward .",
    "it is the same as in a similar model @xcite with @xmath47 .",
    "finally , it is easy to find using ( [ gv],[expv ] ) that @xmath48 where @xmath43 is the saddle point given by ( [ a ] ) .",
    "the @xmath49 does not depend on @xmath34 and the limit @xmath36 seems obvious .",
    "however , in the next section we shall compare this expectation to numerical data and see that the limit @xmath2 is in fact very different ! now let us summarize the properties of this model for @xmath50 .",
    "we see that @xmath51 is a holomorphic function .",
    "it has 3 riemann sheets and we select the one where @xmath52 for @xmath53  which follows from @xmath54 and the gauss theorem .",
    "the only singularities on the physical sheet are the pole at @xmath55 and 2 ( for @xmath56 ) or 4 ( for @xmath57 ) branch points connected by cuts . the brunch points are where 2 of the 3 solutions of ( [ a ] ) coincide .",
    "the trajectory of a cut is determined by a condition that @xmath43 is the deepest minimum ( out of 3 ) of : @xmath58 $ ] .    at @xmath33",
    "the cut along imaginary axis connects two singularities at @xmath59 .",
    "for nonzero @xmath0 the singularities start moving towards each other along the imaginary axis . at @xmath60",
    "each of the branch points bifurcates in two ones which move off the @xmath61 axis into the complex plane .",
    "the cut goes through the origin ( along the @xmath61 axis ) until @xmath62 . at this point",
    "it splits into two cuts connecting complex conjugate points .",
    "this means that @xmath63 in such a model .",
    "for @xmath64 one can easily determine the density of eigenvalues numerically by calculating the eigenvalues of the random matrix @xmath10 and plotting them on a complex plane .",
    "the density of points on such a scatter plot is proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "the results for different values of @xmath65 are shown in fig .",
    "1 . they contradict naive expectations from the previous section . at @xmath33",
    "all eigenvalues are distributed between points @xmath59 on the @xmath61 axis .",
    "however , already at very small nonzero @xmath66 the eigenvalue density is nonzero in a `` blob '' of finite width in @xmath67 direction which grows with @xmath0 .",
    "the same behavior is seen in quenched lattice qcd  @xcite and gives rise to the paradox described in the introduction : there is no discontinuity in the value of @xmath5 at any @xmath68 .",
    "the matrix model has an advantage : it is amenable to exact treatment which clarifies the nature of the problem .",
    "the failure of the naive replica approach can be understood if we look at the expression  ( [ vn ] ) : it does not contain @xmath69 ! on the other hand , eq .  ( [ rhog ] ) tells us that @xmath70 if @xmath14 depends on @xmath69 , i.e. , if it is not holomorphic .",
    "in fact , the correct replica trick for a non - hermitian matrix should start from the quantity : @xmath71 which is now real due to introduction of the quarks with conjugate dirac matrix . naively , in the limit @xmath36",
    "the conjugate quarks decouple but , as we shall see , this is not always the case ! in mathematics an analogous construction",
    "is called a v - transform  @xcite and allows one to study spectra of non - hermitian matrices . in the present context",
    "this formal construction has a clear and simple physical meaning",
    ".    we can calculate ( [ vn2 ] ) using the same method as for ( [ vn ] ) .",
    "now , however , we have to introduce 4 auxiliary complex @xmath44 fields , and we arrive at : @xmath72    the set of solutions of the saddle point equation is richer in this case .",
    "there is a solution with @xmath73 . in this case",
    "the conjugate quarks do decouple and we obtain the same holomorphic function @xmath14 as before .",
    "however , there is another solution in which the condensates @xmath74 and @xmath75 are not zero ! then the function @xmath14 is not holomorphic and therefore @xmath70 .",
    "this saddle point dominates the integral at small @xmath12 for @xmath76 .",
    "the condensates @xmath74 and @xmath75 are bilinears of the type @xmath77 , mixing original @xmath78 and conjugate @xmath79 quarks .",
    "these condensates do not break the original chiral symmetry but a spurious ( replica type ) symmetry involving both original and conjugate quarks .",
    "similar condensates carrying baryon number were discussed in the @xmath80 model of qcd _ with _ quarks @xcite . in the quenched theory , as in @xcite , the original chiral symmetry is always restored at @xmath68 . the spurious symmetry is spontaneously broken for @xmath81 and is restored for @xmath82 .",
    "the boundary of the @xmath70 region is given by : @xmath83.\\ ] ] it is plotted on fig . 1 for comparison with numerical data .",
    "the baryonic condensates @xmath74 and @xmath75 inside of the `` blob '' are given by : @xmath84 on the boundary ( [ yx ] ) they vanish and the two solutions ( holomorphic and non - holomorphic ) match .",
    "in the outer region : @xmath73 and @xmath48 is the solution of the cubic equation ( [ a ] ) . inside of the `` blob '' the resolvent is given by : @xmath85 and the density of the eigenvalues ( [ rhog ] ) is : @xmath86    to appreciate non - triviality of this result one should notice that expression ( [ g ] ) which defines the resolvent appears to depend only on @xmath12 ! the limit @xmath2 must be taken with great care , as is well - known in the replica approach  @xcite .",
    "the fermion determinant in qcd is complex at nonzero chemical potential .",
    "lattice simulations of such a theory are extremely inefficient . therefore all reliable data from lattice qcd so far have been obtained for a quenched theory .",
    "we learn from the random matrix model that the quenched theory at finite @xmath0 behaves qualitatively different from the qcd with dynamical quarks .",
    "rather , the quenched approximation describes a theory where each of the quarks has a conjugate partner , so that the fermion determinant is non - negative .",
    "we see that for such a theory the result @xmath8 is natural .",
    "similar arguments have been given by several authors in different settings and using less realistic models @xcite .",
    "here it can be demonstrated in a very clean and explicit way .",
    "simulations with dynamical quarks at strong coupling are possible in @xmath80 and @xmath87 qcd  @xcite and also agree with our results .",
    "the @xmath88 is finite in the @xmath87 theory . on the other hand , in the @xmath80 theory , where the quarks are self - conjugate , @xmath8 due to the baryonic condensates .",
    "the matrix model describes many features of the chiral symmetry breaking in qcd very well @xcite .",
    "one of the apparent limitations , however , is that it is static  there are no kinetic terms and we can not study spectrum of masses . in the quenched qcd @xmath88",
    "appears to coincide with half of the mass of the so - called baryonic pion  @xcite  a bound state of a quark and a conjugate antiquark .",
    "it is degenerate with the @xmath89-meson but carries a nonzero baryon number . from the exact solution ( [ yx ] ) we find @xmath90 , for small quark mass @xmath91 .",
    "if we had @xmath92 in our model we could relate @xmath88 to the mass of the pion .",
    "the model also does not account for the confinement of quarks .",
    "it remains to be seen if the confinement plays a role in the case under consideration .",
