    "the main difficulty is that the smaller signal for @xmath23 must be isolated from the much larger `` background '' of @xmath26 .",
    "this requires ensuring that the signal events for @xmath23 do not carry net strangeness . in the following we discuss two ideas that may be used to determine the branching ratio and partial rate asymmetry for @xmath202 .",
    "we also compare the experimental sensitivity to the pra s for @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "one strategy that may be helpful in determining @xmath203 is to use a multiplicity cut so that one deals with a semi - inclusive sample consisting of a maximum of @xmath204 ( say 5 ) mesons .",
    "using such a measurement along with the corresponding one for @xmath205 , one can deduce the _",
    "total _ inclusive rate for @xmath206 to a very good approximation via : @xmath207 note that each value of @xmath204 for which a measurement is available leads to such an equation .",
    "thus , in principle , the measurements could be repeated for different values of @xmath204 to help reduce systematic uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "there are two key assumptions used in eq .",
    "( [ bapproxgam ] ) .",
    "the first is that @xmath208 holds ; this assumption could introduce errors at the @xmath183 level .",
    "the second assumption is that non - spectator contributions may be ignored  i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ bapproxgam ] ) assumes that the spectator approximation holds precisely .",
    "this latter assumption should work very well for neutral @xmath13 s . for charged @xmath13 s ,",
    "the annihilation graph can make a contribution of order 20%  @xcite , so that eq .",
    "( [ bapproxgam ] ) will receive somewhat larger corrections for @xmath209 ; nevertheless eq .",
    "( [ bapproxgam ] ) provides an excellent basis for the determination of an approximate expression for @xmath210 .",
    "another possibility is to place a mass cut on the recoiling hadron so that @xmath211 mev .",
    "correspondingly there is a minimum energy cut on the photon , e.g. , @xmath212 gev  @xcite .",
    "this would ensure that the decay products result from @xmath4 and not from @xmath22 .",
    "pra determination from this would be quite straightforward : @xmath213 where @xmath214 stands for the branching ratio with the energy cut on the photon .",
    "since the number of @xmath13 s needed for searching for a given asymmetry @xmath215 scales approximately as @xmath216 , the pra in @xmath23 is statistically much more accessible than that in @xmath22 .",
    "the point is that , based on the sm , the pra in @xmath23 is expected to be 20 - 40 times larger than that in @xmath22 .",
    "not only does this offset the difference in their branching ratios , it may even overcome the decrease in detection efficiency for @xmath153 .",
    "as an illustration , suppose @xmath217 .",
    "then , to establish a 16% pra to @xmath218 significance with a 20% detection efficiency and a @xmath219 tagging efficiency , the needed number of @xmath13-@xmath15 pairs is : @xmath220 in contrast , let us take @xmath221 , a detection efficiency of 70% and a 50% tagging efficiency . in this case",
    "the number of @xmath13-@xmath15 pairs needed is : @xmath222 therefore , establishing a pra in @xmath1 may be less difficult than in @xmath223 .",
    "the study of cp violation in @xmath13 decays is one of the central themes at the various @xmath13-facilities .",
    "in particular , the standard model ckm paradigm of cp violation will be tested and new sources of cp violation will be searched for . in this work , we have shown that the charged higgs loop contribution to the rate asymmetry in @xmath0 is small in all models due to an accidental cancellation in the loop integrals . more specifically , in charged higgs models , @xmath224 .",
    "as a result , the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ acpgen3 ] ) nearly cancel and the third term is suppressed , leading to a small asymmetry .",
    "therefore , any experimental discovery of direct cp violation in @xmath0 at the @xmath183 level will be due to new sources of cp violation beyond charged higgs , for example supersymmetry .",
    "we have also explained why chargino loops in supersymmetry do not undergo this cancellation .",
    "this is because @xmath200 is generically a few times larger than @xmath201 .",
    "consequently , sizeable asymmetries are possible within supersymmetry .",
    "the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath1 behaves quite differently from its counterpart in @xmath22 . in multi - higgs doublet models ,",
    "the asymmetry can be large and of opposite sign relative to the sm . in the t2hdm ,",
    "in particular , cp violation is mainly determined by the ckm phase , and the asymmetry can show a strong deviation from the sm prediction if the observed cp violation in the neutral kaon system has a sizable component from the charged higgs sector .",
    "these features make the the experimental measurement of the rate asymmetry in @xmath4 very worthwhile .",
