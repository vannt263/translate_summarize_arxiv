    "generation of magnetic fields by a turbulent flow of conducting fluid is a fundamental problem which has a large number of applications in solar physics , astrophysics , geophysics , planetary physics and in laboratory studies ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) . in recent time",
    "the problem of nonlinear mean - field magnetic dynamo is a subject of active discussions ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the conventional approach to the nonlinear dynamo is based on comparison of the three effects participating in dynamo action , namely the @xmath0 effect ( caused by helical motions of a turbulent fluid ) , the large - scale differential ( nonuniform ) rotation @xmath3 and the turbulent magnetic diffusivity @xmath4 .",
    "the mean magnetic field is generated due to a combined effect of the differential rotation and the @xmath0 effect .",
    "these effects have been considered as independent phenomena . in particular ,",
    "the electromotive force has been determined independently of the differential rotation .",
    "on the other hand , the differential rotation can be regarded as large - scale motions with a mean velocity shear imposed on the small - scale turbulent fluid flow .",
    "an interaction of the mean differential rotation with the small - scale turbulent motions can cause a generation of a mean magnetic field even in a nonhelical , homogeneous and incompressible turbulent fluid flow .",
    "this mechanism of mean - field dynamo is associated with a shear - current effect which is determined by the @xmath5 term in the electromotive force , where @xmath6 is the mean vorticity caused by the mean velocity shear and @xmath7 is the mean electric current ( see @xcite ) . a nonlinear theory of a shear - current effect in a nonrotating homogeneous and nonhelical turbulence with an imposed mean velocity shear in a plane geometry was developed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that during the nonlinear growth of the mean magnetic field , the shear - current effect changes its sign , but there is no quenching of this effect contrary to the quenching of the usual @xmath0 effect , the nonlinear turbulent magnetic diffusion , etc .    in this study we investigated the effects of differential and uniform rotation on nonlinear electromotive force .",
    "the main conclusion of this study is that the nonlinear electromotive force can not be determined independently of the mean differential rotation .",
    "we found a nonhelical @xmath0 effect which is caused by a differential rotation and is independent of a hydrodynamic helicity .",
    "there is no quenching of this effect contrary to the quenching of the usual @xmath0 effect caused by a hydrodynamic helicity .",
    "the mean differential rotation of fluid can decrease the total @xmath0 effect due to the nonhelical @xmath0 effect .",
    "two kinds of the @xmath0 effect ( helical and nonhelical ) have opposite signs .",
    "therefore , the total @xmath0 effect should always change its sign during the nonlinear growth of the mean magnetic field because there is a quenching of the usual ( helical ) @xmath0 effect .",
    "this can saturate the growth of the mean magnetic field .",
    "the mean differential rotation creates also the shear - current effect .",
    "we found that the mean differential rotation increases the growth rate of the large - scale dynamo instability at a weak mean magnetic field due to the shear - current effect , and causes a saturation of the growth of the mean magnetic field at a stronger field .",
    "note that the applications of the obtained results to the solar convective zone shows that the nonlinear shear - current effect becomes dominant at least at the base of the convective zone .",
    "we found that the nonlinear function @xmath8 defining the shear - current effect is the same for a turbulence with a mean differential rotation in cylindrical and spherical geometries for an axisymmetric mean field dynamo problem and for a nonrotating turbulence with an imposed linear mean velocity shear in a plane geometry .",
    "the latter case was investigated in @xcite .",
    "we also studied an effect of a uniform rotation on the nonlinear electromotive force .",
    "in particular , we developed a nonlinear theory of the @xmath1 effect and we determined the nonlinear quenching of the hydrodynamic part of the @xmath0 effect which is caused by both , a uniform rotation and inhomogeneity of turbulence .",
    "other nonlinear coefficients defining the nonlinear electromotive force are also determined as a function of a uniform rotation . in this study we considered a uniform rotation with a small rotation rate in comparison with the correlation time of the fluid turbulent velocity field .",
    "we studied all the above effects using the spectral @xmath2 approximation ( the third - order closure procedure ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we formulated the assumptions and the method of the derivation of the nonlinear electromotive force in a turbulence with a uniform and nonuniform rotations . in section",
    "iii we considered axisymmetric mean - field dynamo equations and determined the coefficients defining the electromotive force for a rotating turbulence . in section iii we also discussed in details the effects of differential and uniform rotation on nonlinear coefficient defining the electromotive force . in section",

    "thus , when the nonlinear dynamo number decreases with the growth of the mean magnetic field , the nonlinear saturation of the magnetic field is possible .    in this study we showed that the differential rotation of fluid can decrease the total @xmath0 effect . in particular , the mean differential rotation causes the nonhelical @xmath0 effect , @xmath289 , which is independent of a hydrodynamic helicity .",
    "we demonstrated that there is no quenching of this effect contrary to the quenching of the regular nonlinear @xmath0 effect , @xmath290 . in this study we found that these two kinds of the @xmath0 effect have opposite signs .",
    "thus , the total @xmath0 effect should change its sign during the nonlinear evolution of the mean magnetic field , and there is a range of magnitudes of the mean magnetic field , where the nonlinear dynamo number decreases with the growth of the mean magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the algebraic nonlinearity alone can saturate the growth of the mean magnetic field if one take into account the effect of differential rotation on the nonlinear electromotive force .",
    "for instance , the nonhelical @xmath0 effect causes a saturation of the growth of the mean magnetic field at the base of the convective zone at @xmath291 ( see below ) , where @xmath292 is the equipartition mean magnetic field .",
    "however , the nonhelical @xmath0 effect vanishes if the mean rotation is constant on the cylinders which are parallel to the rotation axis .    in this study",
    "we also demonstrated that the mean differential rotation which causes the shear - current effect , increases a growth rate of the large - scale dynamo instability at weak mean magnetic fields , and causes a saturation of the growth of the mean magnetic field for a stronger field .",
    "the nonlinear shear - current effect and the nonhelical @xmath0 effect become very important at the base of the convective zone ( see below ) .",
    "when we apply the obtained results to the solar convective zone , we have to take into account that all physical ingredients of the dynamo model vary strongly with the depth @xmath293 below the solar surface and we have to use some average quantities in the dynamo equations .",
    "we use mainly estimates of governing parameters taken from models of the solar convective zone ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , in the upper part of the convective zone , say at depth @xmath294 cm , the magnetic reynolds number @xmath295 the maximum scale of turbulent motions @xmath296 cm , the characteristic turbulent velocity in the maximum scale @xmath73 of turbulent motions @xmath297 cm s@xmath298 , the fluid density @xmath299 g @xmath300 the turbulent magnetic diffusion @xmath301 @xmath302 s@xmath298 and the equipartition mean magnetic field is @xmath303 g. thus , in the upper part of the convective zone the parameters @xmath304 and @xmath305 . according to various models , the ranges of the dynamo number @xmath306 can be considered as realistic for the solar case . at the base of the convective zone ( at depth @xmath307 cm ) , the magnetic reynolds number @xmath308 the maximum scale of turbulent motions @xmath309 cm , the characteristic turbulent velocity @xmath310 cm s@xmath298 , the fluid density @xmath311 g @xmath300 the turbulent magnetic diffusion @xmath312 @xmath302s@xmath298 . the equipartition mean magnetic field @xmath313 g. thus , at the base of the convective zone the parameters @xmath314 and @xmath315 .",
