    "the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) states of a photon is an attractive basis for quantum information processing and communication , because it allows a higher dimensional representation of quantum information @xcite .",
    "one application where such a higher dimensional representation can have benefits in terms of information capacity is in free - space quantum communication .",
    "unfortunately , the turbulence in the atmosphere causes the decoherence of entanglement of oam states .",
    "the refractive index fluctuations in the turbulent atmosphere produce random phase modulations that distort the oam states .",
    "this process is similar to the distortion suffered by oam modes in classical optical beams due to scintillation in turbulence @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we derive a theoretical framework with which one can investigate the decoherence of oam entanglement in atmospheric turbulence . some previous investigations of this process @xcite are based on the work of patterson @xcite , who assumed that one can model the turbulent medium with a single phase screen and parameterized the turbulence with one parameter , the fried parameter @xcite . as a result the effects of the propagation , such as beam spreading , intensity scintillation and multiple scattering among different modes , are not incorporated into the model . neither is this framework able to consider the individual effects of the different scale parameters that are combined into the fried parameter .",
    "another approach to investigating the decoherence of oam entanglement in atmospheric turbulence is to model the turbulent medium as an absorbing and scattering medium @xcite .",
    "however , this analysis assumes that the turbulence is weak .",
    "the approach that is used in this paper is based on the incremental effect of the turbulent atmosphere on the quantum state ( density operator ) , expressed as a first order differential equation , which can then be solved to obtain the evolution over the entire propagation distance .",
    "this approach is reminiscent of a master equation approach , however , here , the derivative is taken with respect to propagation distance instead of time . in this framework",
    "one can incorporate any model for the turbulence  i.e.  any power spectral density such as kolmogorov , tartaskii or von karman @xcite . by implication one can investigate the effect of any of the scale parameters associated with the whole process and not only the fried parameter .",
    "one can apply this framework to cases with arbitrary strong turbulence or strong scintillation .    for the purpose of the derivation",
    ", it is assumed that the light is monochromatic , that the beam propagates paraxially and that it has a uniform polarization to allow scalar propagation .",
    "the final result can be generalized to polychromatic vector fields .",
    "the paraxial approximation would always be valid in practical applications of this framework .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we discuss how to treat a photon field that propagates through a linear spatially inhomogeneous medium in section  [ fqua ] .",
    "then we discuss the infinitesimal transformation of the momentum space wave functions of such photon fields in section  [ eom ] . in section  [ denop ]",
    "we show how we define the density operator in terms of the oam and momentum bases .",
    "the derivation of the infinitesimal propagation equation ( ipe ) is shown in section  [ deripe ] , with the aid of the ensemble averaging discussed in appendix  [ ensemb ] .",
    "then in section  [ solvint ] we show how one can treat the different integrals that appear in the ipe , using the generating function of oam model discussion in appendix  [ oamgen ] . in section  [ qubit ] a simple example",
    "is considered .",
    "we discuss the results in section  [ disc ] and end with a summary in section  [ summ ] .",
    "a dynamical system is generally understood to be one evolving in time . for a quantum system",
    "this evolution is unitary , being described by a unitary operator that is given by an exponential operator with the time integrated hamiltonian as its argument . within this context the process of decoherence of oam entanglement in a turbulent atmosphere",
    "is not described by a dynamical system .",
    "although the turbulent medium is inhomogeneous it is still assumed to be linear , which implies that one can consider each temporal frequency separately , leading to a monochromatic assumption .",
    "the temporal behavior of the field is therefore simply given by @xmath0 .",
    "a straight forward hamiltonian approach for this problem is therefore inappropriate . instead of having a three - dimensional field that evolves in time ,",
    "our approach in this paper is to ignore the temporal behavior and instead consider a two - dimensional field that changes as it moves along the third spatial dimension .    due to the monochromatic assumption , which fixes the wavelength of the light @xmath1",
    ", the @xmath2-component of the propagation vector can be expressed as a function of the other two components @xmath3 as a result the momentum basis under the monochromatic approximation becomes a two - dimensional basis @xmath4 , where the propagation vector @xmath5 represents the two - dimensional projection of the three - dimensional propagation vector .",
    "it is necessary to include the evanescent momentum states ( those for which @xmath6 is imaginary ) to ensure that the basis is complete .",
    "however , under the paraxial approximation the evanescent part of the field is negligible .",
    "we assume that the @xmath2-direction is the general direction of propagation .",
    "therefore , the two - dimensional momentum basis describes two - dimensional fields on the transverse plane , perpendicular to the propagation direction . in the absence of turbulence",
    "one can recover the full three - dimensional field by using fresnel diffraction theory to propagate the two - dimensional field along @xmath2 . in the presence of turbulence",
    "the two - dimensional field transforms in a more complicated way from one plane to another .",
    "we formulate the decoherence process in terms of this transformation .",
    "an arbitrary pure state of a monochromatic , uniformly polarized single photon can now be expressed on the transverse plane in terms of the two - dimensional momentum basis @xmath7 where the coefficient function @xmath8 is the momentum space wave function @xmath9 .",
    "the inverse two - dimensional fourier transform of the momentum space wave function gives the position space wave function @xmath10 on the transverse plane at @xmath11 .",
    "although the oam basis ( which is equivalent to the two - dimensional momentum basis ) is the preferred basis for an analysis where the photons are entangled in term of oam , the turbulence is modeled in terms of a power spectral density that is defined in terms of a momentum basis . as a result one",
    "is forced to have a mixture of both bases in this analysis .",
    "we therefore start with the momentum basis and eventually express the oam basis in terms of it .",
    "for an interaction - free system the quantum wave function obeys the same equations of motion as the classical field .",
    "therefore , the equation of motion for the position space wave function can be derived from maxwell s equations . in a source - free region",
    "this gives the helmholtz equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the scalar part of the electric field ( assuming the polarization is uniform and can be ignored ) , @xmath14 is the wave number , @xmath15 is the refractive index and @xmath16 .",
    "the inhomogeneous medium is represented by a spatially varying index of refraction @xmath17 this variation is very small ( @xmath18 ) , which implies that one can approximate the helmholtz equation as @xmath19 furthermore , we assume that the beam is paraxial and propagates in the @xmath2-direction .",
    "so we define @xmath20 which then leads to the paraxial wave equation with the extra inhomogeneous medium term @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the transverse part of the gradient operator .",
    "now we replace @xmath23 with its two - dimensional inverse fourier transform , @xmath24 which contains the angular spectrum of the optical field @xmath25 .",
    "the latter also represents the momentum space wave function for the purpose of the quantum analysis",
    ". then we obtain @xmath26 where @xmath27 indicates convolution and @xmath28 is the two - dimensional fourier transform of @xmath29 .",
    "this equation represents the infinitesimal transformation of the momentum space wave function during propagation .",
    "it forms the basis of the derivation of the ipe .",
    "for the purpose of this derivation we first consider a single photon and then generalize the result for the case of two photons .",
    "the density operator of an arbitrary single photon state can be expressed in the oam base by @xmath30 where we use a single index to denote both the indices of the oam states , @xmath31 .",
    "( see appendix [ oamgen ] for a discussion of the oam modes . )",
    "unless stated otherwise , each oam index used in the subsequent derivation always represents both the indices associated with a particular oam mode .",
    "each of these oam states can be expanded in terms of the two - dimensional momentum basis @xmath32 leading to the following expression for the density operator in terms of the two - dimensional momentum basis @xmath33 where the dependence on @xmath2 is shown explicitly to make it apparent that this expression for @xmath34 is only valid on a transverse plane for a specific value of @xmath2 . here , and also later",
    ", we use only one integral sign to represent several @xmath35-space integrals . by evaluating the summations in eq .",

    "( [ spekprop ] ) from plane to plane .",
    "note that inside the expression the @xmath2-dependence is carried by the momentum space wave functions and not by the density matrix elements .",
    "this is because the transformation of the density operator during propagation over an infinitesimal distance through turbulence is caused by the distortion of the momentum space wave functions .",
    "after such an infinitesimal propagation these momentum space wave functions no longer represent the fourier transforms of the original modes .",
    "one needs to re - expand these distorted wave functions in terms of the momentum space wave functions of the oam modes and incorporate the expansion coefficients in the density matrix elements .",

    "at the end we apply the transformation to the expression for @xmath34 .",
    "we are ready to consider the steps in the derivation of the ipe . for this purpose",

    "( while the @xmath135 s come from the autocorrelation functions of the oam modes , the @xmath136 s come from the cross - correlations of modes with different azimuthal indices , which give much smaller overlaps with the power spectral density . ) from these results it appears that the effect of scattering and the implied loss of photons in the desired oam modes may turn out to be a more significant challenge for free - space quantum communication than the decoherence of oam entanglement . on the other hand , the effects of the severe trunction may imply that these results are but a poor reflection of what really would happen in this scenario .",
    "the loss of entanglement due to decoherence is a challenge that confronts the development of quantum communication systems .",
    "it is necessary to be able to predict the propagation scale over which this decoherence takes place before a successful free - space quantum communication can be designed .",
    "previous attempts to make such predictions @xcite were based on certain assumptions @xcite , the effects of which were perhaps not completely clear .",
    "intuitively , the assumption that one can represent the atmosphere by a single phase screen sounds reasonable , and so does the assumption that one can represent the strength of the turbulence by the fried parameter .",
    "however , carefully considering the effect of turbulence , one realizes that some physical effects of the scintillation process is lost as a result of these assumptions .",
    "turbulence is a cascaded process .",
    "the random index fluctuations cause a phase modulation of the traversing optical beam . directly after an initial random phase modulation , the amplitude of the optical beam is unaffected .",
    "however , during subsequent propagation the phase distortion is partially transferred into an amplitude distortion .",
    "this mixture of phase and amplitude distortion receives further phase modulations as the beam passes through the random medium .",
    "the random phase modulation and the propagation both play important roles in the process that produces the scintillated beam . without the propagation part of the process",
    "the phase modulation will never be converted into amplitude scintillation .",
    "since oam modes have particular phase and amplitude characteristics , both the phase and the amplitude are important to give the correct scattering coefficients .",
    "the formulation that is presented in this paper takes into account both the random phase modulation and the propagation and therefore gives the required effect on the phase and the amplitude of the modes .",
    "the effect of having a single phase screen where the turbulence is completely characterized by the fried parameter is shown by the fast decay limit , discussed in section  [ fdl ] . only in this limit",
    "can the effect of the turbulence be completely described by the fried parameter . beyond this limit",
    "the scale parameters in the problem starts to contribute in a way that can not be combined into the fried parameter .",
    "in other words , different combinations of these scale parameters can give different predictions even when the fried parameter remains fixed .",
    "the implication is that , when one models the quantum scintillation process by a single phase screen in terms of the fried parameter one tacitly assumes the fast decay limit and it is debatable whether the fast decay limit is valid or even useful for a free - space quantum communication system .",
    "we use the transformation of the momentum space wave functions of oam modes after an infinitesimal propagation through a turbulent atmosphere to derive an ipe for the decoherence of oam entangled biphoton states .",
    "the resulting set of first order differential equations is used to study the evolution of a severely truncated density matrix where the initial state of a biphoton is an entangled qubit in the oam basis .",
    "the results are compared with previous results in the literature .",
    "the laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) modes , which are solutions of the paraxial wave equation , are given in terms of normalized coordinates by @xmath166 where the normalized coordinates are given by @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 , in terms of the initial radius of the mode profile @xmath142 and the rayleigh range @xmath140 ; @xmath170 is the radial index ( a non - negative integer ) ; @xmath171 is the azimuthal index ( a signed integer ) ; the @xmath172 sign is given by the sign of @xmath171 ; @xmath173 is a normalization constant given by @xmath174^{1/2 } \\label{lgn}\\ ] ] and @xmath175 represents the associate laguerre polynomials , which can be obtained from the generating function , @xmath176 by computing its @xmath170-th derivative , @xmath177    the azimuthal index @xmath171 of the lg modes represent the amount of oam that each photon in such an optical modes carries",
    ". therefore , the lg modes act as an oam basis in quantum optics .",
    "the lg mode functions are the position space wave functions of the oam states and their fourier transforms are the corresponding momentum space wave functions .    in the paraxial limit",
    "the lg modes are treated as two - dimensional functions of the transverse coordinates @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and these two - dimensional functions change as a function of the normalized propagation distance @xmath158 .",
    "one can use a generating function for the oam basis functions ( lg modes ) to evaluate the integrals that contain oam momentum space wave functions .",
    "such integrals only have to be solved once and afterward the solutions for particular oam modes are generated using derivatives . since it is always easier to compute derivatives than to solve integrals",
