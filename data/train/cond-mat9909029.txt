    "charge transport through a normal conductor  superconductor ( ns ) interface is accompanied by a conversion of quasiparticle current to a supercurrent . in the andreev reflection ,",
    "by which the conversion occurs , an electron - like quasiparticle in the normal conductor ( with an excitation energy lower than the energy gap of the superconductor ) incident on the ns interface is retroreflected into a hole - like quasiparticle ( with reversal of its momentum and its energy relative to the fermi level ) and a cooper pair is added to the condensate of the superconductor @xcite .",
    "for an ideal ns interface , a signature of cooper pair transport and the andreev scattering is a doubling of the conductance compared to the normal state conductance .",

    "the conductance formula holds for an arbitrary disorder potential and is a multi - channel generalization of a conductance formula first obtained by blonder , tinkham and klapwijk @xcite who considered a delta function potential as a model for the interface barrier potential .",
    "( [ beenakker ] ) is computationally convenient since standard methods developed for quantum transport in normal conducting semiconductor structures can be applied to calculate the transmission matrix @xmath7 or the corresponding transmission eigenvalues @xmath3 .",
    "equations ( [ beenakker ] ) and ( [ landauer ] ) apply to two - probe structures where the length @xmath10 of the disordered normal region is much shorter than the phase - correlation length over which quasiparticle propagation remains phase - coherent .",
    "the effect of coupling a mesoscopic region to a voltage probe was first used by bttiker in the context of the role of quantum phase - coherence in normal conducting series resistors @xcite and subsequently in the study of the cross - over from coherent to sequential tunneling in series of barriers @xcite . in the work of chang and bagwell @xcite the model of bttiker @xcite",
    "was used as a normal - metal probe controlling the andreev - level occupation in a josephson junction . in this paper",
    "we apply the model of bttiker to a two - probe semiconductor - superconductor junction with a phase - coherent normal region .",
    "however , here we consider the case where the dephasing reservoir is constituted by a real voltage probe . as a general model we consider a normal region with two arbitrary scattering regions ( characterized by scattering matrices @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) separated by a coherent ballistic conductor of length @xmath10 to which the voltage probe couples , see ( a ) in fig .",

    "specifically we study the case where the total current is conserved , but , due to the coupling to the voltage probe the non - equilibrium distribution of electrons and holes equilibrates to a fermi  dirac distribution . in nambu space",

    "we note that in our approach the voltage probe is real as it is also the case in the recent work of gramespacher and bttiker @xcite where a tunneling tip is coupled weakly to the normal side of a two - probe ns structure . as in the original work of bttiker",
    "@xcite the voltage probe could also be considered as a fictitious probe used in modeling a finite dephasing length of the normal region .",
    "however , we note that the model only accounts for dephasing caused by inelastic scattering and that thermal dephasing , which is the dominant dephasing mechanism in most semiconductor  superconductor structures , can not be accounted for by this model @xcite .",
