    "more than three decades ago , the standard thin disk was proposed by shakura & sunyayev ( 1973 , hereafter ssd ) , which is regarded as the milestone of black hole ( bh ) accretion theory .",
    "however , the effective radiation temperature is very low in ssd , being obviously not consistent with the observations of the hard x - ray and gamma - ray radiation in x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) . in order to overcome this shortcoming",
    ", some authors proposed the cooling - dominated hot disk ( shapiro , lightman & eardley 1976 , hereafter sle ) . a vital disadvantage with sle lies in thermal instability .",
    "not long ago , advection - dominated accretion flow ( hereafter adaf ) was suggested by some authors ( narayan & yi 1994 , hereafter ny94 ; 1995a ; 1995b ; abramowicz 1995 ; esin 1997 ; manmoto 1997 ; gammie and popham 1998 ; popham and gammie 1998 ; yuan 1999 ) .",
    "the adaf model succeeds in explaining the observed spectra of some sources , such as sgr a * ( narayan 1995c ) , ngc4258 ( lasota 1996 ) and gro j1655 - 40 ( lasota 1998 ) .",
    "recently , yuan ( 2001 hereafter y01 ; 2003 ) extended the adaf model and put forward a new two - temperature hot branch of equilibrium solutions , i.e. , the luminous hot accretion flow ( hereafter lhaf ) .",
    "it is argued in y01 that lhaf is much more luminous than adaf as the entropy of the accreting mater supply the radiation as well as the viscous dissipation .",
    "yuan ( 2006 , hereafter y06 ) pointed out that the hard states at their highest luminosities of some xrbs could not be explained by adaf , while lhaf can produce the highest luminosity in the hard state of xte j1550 - 564 .",
    "however , as argued in y06 that neither adaf nor lhaf could be used to explain the highest luminosity of gx 339 - 4 ( done & gierlinski 2003 ; zdziarski et al . 2004 ) , which is a great challenge to lhaf .",
    "probably , an efficient way of increasing the luminosity in hard - state is the magnetic coupling ( mc ) process , which is an important mechanism for extracting energy from a rotating bh ( blandford 1999 ; li & paczynski 2000 ; li 2002a , hereafter l02 ; wang et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 , hereafter w02 , w03 , respectively ) .",
    "however , the mc has been formulated in the context of a relativistic thin disk ( henceforth mcthin , page & thorne 1974 ; l02 ; w03 ) , in which both the gravitational energy of the accreting matter and the rotational energy transferred into the disk are assumed to be radiated away in black - body spectrum .",
    "thus mcthin is obviously not consistent with observed hard power - law x - ray spectra .    to solve the above puzzle in lhaf we intend to incorporate the mc with adaf ( henceforth mcadaf ) .",
    "it turns out that the steep emissivity index in seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and the two xrbs : xte j1655 - 500 and gx 339 - 4 could be interpreted based on mcadaf , and our fittings are consistent with the low bh spins in these sources , and that the observation of the highest hard - state luminosity of gx 339 - 4 could be explained .",
    "furthermore , a transition radius between adaf and ssd could be given naturally in mcadaf with the hard x - rays spectra produced in the mc region .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in @xmath0 2",
    "mcadaf is outlined , and the expressions of the mc power and torque in mcadaf are derived . in @xmath0 3 ,",
    "the mc effects on disk radiation and the emissivity index are discussed .",
    "it is found that the emissivity index is consistent with the recent _ xmm - newton _ observations of the nearby bright seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and the two xrbs : xte j1655 - 500 and gx 339 - 4 for the low bh spin .",
    "finally , in @xmath0 4 , we summarize our main results . throughout this paper the geometric units",
    "@xmath1 are used .",
    "in the previous mc model the disk is regarded as a thin disk , in which the rotational energy transferred from the bh to the inner disk is assumed to radiate away as the black body spectrum . in mcadaf , however , this assumption is changed to overcome the shortcomings of mcthin .",
    "it is assumed that only a fraction of energy transferred in the inner disk is radiated , and the rest energy deposited in the accreting matter as entropy is delivered to the bh as adaf .",
    "thus we have the magnetic field configuration of mcadaf as shown in figure 1 , in which adaf is located in the mc region with closed field lines penetrating the accretion flow , and ssd is located outside the mc region .",
    "this configuration is significantly different from that given in w02 for mcthin , and a transition radius between adaf and ssd is given naturally in mcadaf .        in order to facilitate the discussion on mcadaf in an analytic way",
    ", we make the following assumptions .",
    "\\(i ) adaf is both stable and perfectly conducting , and the closed magnetic field lines are frozen in the accretion flow .",
    "\\(ii ) the magnetic field is assumed to be weak , and the instabilities of the magnetic field are ignored . the magnetosphere is stationary , axisymmetric and force - free outside the bh and adaf .    following armitage & natarajan ( 1999 ) , the total pressure @xmath2 in the inner part of mcadaf",
    "is given by    @xmath3    where the magnetic pressure @xmath4 is related to the total pressure @xmath2 by    @xmath5    in equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( 2 ) @xmath6 is the viscosity parameter , @xmath7 is the ratio of gas pressure to total pressure , and @xmath8 is defined as @xmath9 ( ny94 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 measures the degree to which the flow is advection - dominated , and @xmath11 is the ratio of specific heats ( esin 1997 ) .",
    "thus we have    @xmath12    combining equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( 2 ) , we have the expression for the magnetic field in the inner part of the mcadaf as follows ,    @xmath13    narayan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) pointed out that the inner edge radius of an adaf is located between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , i.e. ,    @xmath16    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the radii of the innermost bound circular orbit and the last stable circular orbit , respectively .",
