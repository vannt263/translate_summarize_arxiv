    "in the standard model  ( sm ) , the flavor - changing neutral current  ( fcnc ) interactions , which are absent at tree level , are induced by quantum corrections and highly suppressed due to the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani  ( gim ) mechanism  @xcite .",
    "possible new physics  ( np ) beyond the sm can manifest itself by altering the expected rates of these fcnc - induced processes .",

    "the fcnc - induced decays @xmath13  ( where @xmath14 denotes either a @xmath15- or a @xmath16-flavored quark ) are exceedingly rare within the sm , with branching ratios of order of @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "however , these processes could be significantly enhanced by some potential np models  @xcite , like supersymmetry , multi - higgs doublet models and sm extensions with exotic quarks",

    "these top - quark anomalous couplings could also be probed by studying the top - quark production at high - energy colliders  @xcite .",
    "so far , the direct experimental bounds on these anomalous couplings are not so restrictive and the world s best limit is set by the d0 collaboration , with a branching ratio @xmath18 at @xmath19 c.l .",
    "the constraint will be improved significantly by the large top - quark sample to be available at the cern large hadron collider  ( lhc ) , which is expected to produce 80 million top pairs and 34 million single tops annually .",
    "for example , with about @xmath11 data , the discovery potential of @xmath9 at both the atlas  @xcite and the cms  @xcite collaboration is reported to be of the order of @xmath20 .    however ,",
    "if the top - quark anomalous couplings really existed , the low - energy processes with loops involving the top quark may also be affected , and could therefore provide helpful information for a direct search at high - energy colliders  @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the rare b- and k - meson decays , such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , are particularly interesting .",
    "they are all short - distance dominated fcnc processes induced by the z - penguin and box diagrams , and the calculation of their branching ratios is theoretically rather clean .",
    "they are therefore known to be good probes of flavour dynamics within the sm and beyond  @xcite . as the anomalous couplings @xmath0 can enter the z - penguin diagram , constraints on these couplings",
    "can be obtained by studying deviations from the sm predictions for these decays .",

    "in most extensions of the sm , the new degrees of freedom that modify the ultraviolet behavior of the underlying theory appear only at a scale @xmath23 which is much higher than the electroweak scale @xmath24 .",
    "as long as we are only interested in processes occurring much below the scale @xmath23 , we can always integrate out these new degrees of freedom and describe the np effects in terms of a few higher - dimensional local operators , which are built out of the sm fields and suppressed by inverse powers of the np scale @xmath23  @xcite .",
