    "the ionization of an acid , ha , in condensed phases @xmath0 is clearly influenced by the nature of the solvent s in which the ionization takes place . a molecular understanding of the processes responsible for these solvent effects requires an analysis of the solvation forces that bring about the ionization and examination of how these forces depend on the properties of the solvent molecules .",
    "the analysis is complicated by the fact that the proton is a quantum object and thus the theoretical description must account for its quantum character in determining the interactions between the proton and the solvent .    in this article , we study such acid ionization process in aprotic media .",
    "we have selected two simple prototypic molecular solvents for this study : acetonitrile ( acn ) and dimethylsulfoxide ( dmso ) . while these two molecules have similar dipolar properties they have markedly different effects on the ionization process ;",
    "for example , the dissociation constant for hcl in dmso is several orders of magnitude greater than that in acn.@xcite furthermore , aprotic solvents have been chosen in order to avoid complications due to cooperative proton motion in the solvent ( grotthuss mechanism)@xcite that may play a role when water is the solvent.@xcite    the main focus of this work is on the determination of the potential of mean force as a function of the separation between the h@xmath1 and cl@xmath2 ions .",
    "this allows us to characterize the equilibrium solvation structure ; in particular , if solvent separated ion pairs ( ssip)@xcite can exist in either solvent so that the ionization process should be represented by @xmath3 here h@xmath4 cl@xmath2 represents a metastable configuration corresponding to a local minimum in the mean potential where solvent molecules reside between the ions and the ions may not yet be considered to be completely free ions in solution.@xcite our calculations permit us to determine properties of the solvated quantum proton and to study the differences in the solvation properties in both solvents .    since the ionization process is an example of a reaction that is strongly solvent influenced , it is also of interest to see how the chemistry of ionization processes is changed in finite - size systems .",
    "consequently , we also examine molecular clusters with linear dimensions in the nanometer range to study how the ionization process changes as a function of the cluster size .",
    "it is well known that chemical reactions in clusters present some unique features due to the lack of translational symmetry ; for example , certain charge transfer reactions leading to neutral ion pairs take place in confined systems only above a certain threshold cluster size.@xcite acid dissociative processes occurring in aqueous clusters are also known to exhibit similar behavior where cooperative effects gradually increase , stabilizing the reaction products as the number of the components in the cluster increases.@xcite consequently , it is interesting to extend bulk studies to cluster domains to unveil peculiarities of the mechanisms that govern dissociative processes in aggregates containing small numbers of particles .",

    "the acn [ ch@xmath5cn ] and dmso [ ( ch@xmath5)@xmath6so ] solvents considered in this study were modeled as rigid molecules with the following characteristics : acn was comprised of three sites representing a united atom model for the ch@xmath5 group , c and n units in the linear molecule with separations @xmath7 between sites in a molecule fixed by constraints@xcite at the following values : @xmath7(c - ch@xmath5)=1.46    and @xmath7(n - ch@xmath5)=2.63  .",

    "the usual arithmetic and geometrical means were used to determine respectively the @xmath18 and @xmath19 parameters for the cross interactions .",

    "we considered a much simpler model .",
    "the interaction potential energy between the h and cl atoms leading to dissociation into ions was determined from a density functional calculation for a cl@xmath2 ion in the field of a point positive charge a fixed distance away . by appropriate distribution of the basis functions describing the electronic density of the complex in the neighborhood of the chlorine atom , the  bare",

    "note that in this functional form the coulomb interaction does not depend on the partial charges on the ions determined from the computed electronic density .",
    "nevertheless , in the interactions between the ions and the solvent sites , the variation of the ionic charge with the distance @xmath35 between the cl@xmath2 and h@xmath1 ions was taken into account . in this way",

    "we have made no attempt to reproduce with ( [ vhcl ] ) the actual value of dissociation energy of hcl in @xmath44 or the exact value of the equilibrium distance for the hcl chemical bond .",
    "in fact , our simple approach based on density functional theory was used only as a reasonable interpolative scheme between two well defined electronic structures for reactants and products states : the covalent character of the intramolecular bond at short interatomic distances and the ionic character of the dissociated species . although this is a crude approximation , it captures the importante features of the solvation effects in different environments , especially at the larger separations of interest in this study where the species are well approximated by h@xmath1 and cl@xmath2 ions .    using the charge density extracted from this calculation , the interactions between the cl@xmath2 and h@xmath1 ions and the solvent molecules were taken to be site - site lj plus coulomb interactions .",
    "the lj parameters for these ions were taken from data on cl@xmath2 in h@xmath6o given in rossky et al.@xcite using the normal geometric and arithmetic means and the known parameters for spc water .",
    "the values used in the present calculation are @xmath45 and @xmath46 ; @xmath47 , and @xmath48 and , as earlier , the lj parameters for cross interactions between these ions and the molecular solvent sites were determined from geometric and arithmetic means .",
    "the proton was treated quantum mechanically using feynman s path integral formulation of quantum mechanics.@xcite in this representation the proton is represented by a ring polymer with harmonic bonds between the polymer monomers , which also interact with the other classical particles in the system.@xcite the effective potential of the system is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is boltzmann s constant times temperature , @xmath51 represents the proton mass , @xmath52 refers to the set of classical coordinates and @xmath53 to the proton monomer coordinates with @xmath54 the number of monomers @xmath55 . here",

    "the bulk phase molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on a system composed of 142 solvent molecules plus the two ions confined to a periodic box with sides @xmath67 .",
    "the lj interactions were cut off at half the size of the simulation box .",
    "a quartic spline interpolation was used to make the the coulomb interactions go smoothly to zero at @xmath68 in a 1   region .",

    "the temperatures of both thermostats were fixed at 293 k. the md integration was performed using the verlet algorithm@xcite with a time step of 2 fs .",
    "note that with this time step there are between 50 and 100 time steps per oscillation period of the proton monomers .",
    "the cluster results were obtained from time averages over constant energy molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "the clusters were equilibrated for 50 ps using constant temperature ( nos ) molecular dynamics after this period the thermostat was switched off .",

    "the mean potential as a function of the distance between the ions was obtained from the mean force on the ion pair.@xcite the proton position was defined as the centroid of the proton polymer,@xcite @xmath75 and thus the distance between the cl@xmath2 and h@xmath1 ions is @xmath76 with @xmath77 the position of the cl@xmath2 ion .",

    "finally , we note that the individual dissociation constants for both solvents differ by several orders of magnitude from the corresponding experimental values .",
    "this is expected in view of the simplifications introduced in the design of the potentials .",
    "in fact , differences in a few tenths of a kcal in the potentials lead to considerable variations in calculated dissociation constants . since our emphasis is on the study of relative , quantitative changes in the ionization process as a function of solvent type and environment",
    ", we have made no attempt to tune our simple potential model to describe all quantitative aspects of the equilibrium structure .",
    "the profiles of the potential of mean force presented in fig .  1 show that there are no clearly identifiable solvent separated ion pairs for acn , as signaled by a secondary minimum in the mean potential .",
    "there is only a shallow minimum at @xmath92   giving a barrier between the ssip and cip states of @xmath93 kcal / mol which is within the statistical uncertainty of our calculations .",
    "in contrast , the mean potential for dmso shows a fairly deep secondary minimum at @xmath94   with a barrier separating the cip and ssip states of @xmath95 kcal / mol . in the dmso calculation , the curve was computed from a constrained md simulation as described above .",
    "the filled circles were determined using the formula @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the probability density of @xmath35 and @xmath98 is the uniform distribution .",
    "the probability density @xmath97 was estimated from a histogram of the separation between the ions obtained from a long unconstrained md trajectory initiated near the mean potential secondary minimum at @xmath99  .",
    "note that most of the probability density is confined between @xmath100    with no escape to either contact ion pairs or free ions observed in the course of the @xmath101 ns md simulation .",
    "an idea of the average solvation structure in dmso can be obtained from fig .  2 , where we show a contour plot of the solvent charge density , @xmath102 , for an interionic separation of @xmath103  , which corresponds to ssip separation configuration .",
    "the charge density is defined as @xmath104 where @xmath105 represents the solvent bulk density and the angular brackets @xmath106 denote an ensemble ( or time ) average over configurations with the ion pair separation at a given value of @xmath35 . in ( [ rrhhoo ] ) , we have selected a frame of reference centered on the ion pair , which is taken to lie along the @xmath107 direction in a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath108 ; @xmath109 and @xmath110 represent the cylindrical coordinates and charge of site @xmath111 in the @xmath80-th solvent molecule , respectively . the cl@xmath2 and h@xmath1 ions are denoted by semicircular shaded regions in the bottom of the figure while the @xmath112 and @xmath113 signs indicate regions of high charge density of the corresponding sign .",
    "the picture provides information about both the locations of high solvent density as well as the average orientation of solvent molecules in the vicinity of the ion pair .",
    "figure   2 clearly shows that the solvation structure for dmso is energetically dominated by the electrical coupling between the proton , a bare charge of small size , and the negatively charged oxygen sites of the solvent .",
    "this is indicated by the prominent ",
    "@xmath114 \" charge density maxima to the right and above the proton ; the molecular dipoles are oriented as might be expected , with the negative ends of the molecules lying near to the h@xmath1 side of the ion pair complex and the positive ends of the other solvent molecules oriented towards the cl@xmath2 side . however , the positive charge density near the cl@xmath2 ion is more diffuse indicating weaker solvation and less charge localization .",
    "the analysis of the solvation structure in acn for a similar ion pair separation shows essentially the same qualitative features as previously described for dmso , so a comparative analysis of the charge density profiles is insufficient to understand the differences in ionic stabilization that these solvents present .",
    "perhaps this is to be expected since the solvent contribution to the potential of mean force is the result of a subtle interplay between packing effects governed by short - range , repulsive forces related to the molecular shape , and solute - solvent dipolar forces which depend on overall distribution of molecular electronic density .",
    "the analysis of the solvent structure in the neighborhood of the transition region between cip and ssip ion pair configurations presents interesting differences for the two solvents .",
    "we examine the region where the steep attractive branch of the mean potential reaches its local maximum and levels off .",
    "consider the dipolar density , @xmath115 in the @xmath116-plane . here",
    "@xmath117 is the dipole moment of molecule @xmath80 and , as above , the average is taken with the distance between the ions fixed at @xmath35 .",
    "figures  3(a ) and ( b ) show @xmath118 for @xmath119 for acn and dmso , respectively . for acn one observes two large peaks with opposite sign in the vicinity of h@xmath1 .",
    "this indicates that the acn molecules have a considerable degree of orientational variability so that when the molecular dipole moment is projected onto the @xmath107 axis of the ion pair the projection can take either sign .",
    "in contrast , the dipolar density for dmso in fig .",
    "3(b ) shows no such effect implying that the dmso molecules are much more rigidly ordered in the first solvation shell as indicated in the schematic representation of the structure shown in the bottom parts of the figures .",
    "the results suggest that in acn the local solvent density fluctuations are sufficiently large to promote dipolar orientations that , in average , lead to a less effective dielectric reactive field , lowering the energetic cost to pass from ssip to cip states .",
    "however , in dmso a much more structured three - dimensional solvent network exists that hinders molecular rotations and leads to a stronger coulombic coupling between the proton and the negatively charged oxygen site and a larger free energy barrier .",
    "compared to bulk environments , dissociation processes in small clusters present some distinctive features that may lead to significant variations in the overall dissociation energy of the ion pair .",
    "perhaps the simplest question to be considered is how large should a cluster be to exhibit bulk - like behavior ?",
    "the answer will depend on the particular stage of the dissociation process one is interested in describing . in this study",
    "we focus our attention on the small - intermediate interionic distance regime ; @xmath120 , those characteristic of cip and ssip configurations seen in bulk phases . for interionic distances which are comparable to typical linear dimensions of the cluster ,",
    "surface forces introduce new effects in the dissociation mechanisms.@xcite    in fig .",
    "4 we present the potential of mean force for hcl dissociation in clusters of acn and dmso .",
    "we first observe that the results for the mean potential for an @xmath121 acn cluster , for interionic distances that are not too large , lie close to those for bulk solvents , indicating that even for this relatively small aggregate the solvent reactive field is comparable to that of bulk environments and that surface effects play only a minor role in determining the functional form of @xmath83 .",
    "very small clusters exhibit quite different behavior as is evident from the results for @xmath83 for an @xmath70 acn cluster shown in the figure .",
    "the typical bulk phase plateau regime at moderate interionic distances has disappeared since for such small aggregates there is insufficient space for independent solvation of the individual ions .",
    "figure  4 also shows results for the mean potential for a dmso cluster with @xmath71 at temperature @xmath122 .",
    "our results confirm that solvent separated ion pairs still persist in clusters of this size although the free energy barrier between the cip and ssip states is smaller , @xmath123 kcal / mol .",
    "several interesting features of the dissociation mechanisms in acn which are common to bulk and clusters environments can be seen from typical snapshots of cluster configurations . in fig .",
    "5 we present two often - encountered cluster configurations for acn clusters with @xmath71 where the ion pair separation is fixed at the transition value corresponding to the sharply rising part of the mean potential discussed above .",
    "the acn molecules lying closest to the h@xmath1 ion are rendered in dark colors for contrast while the remaining solvent molecules are lightly shaded .",
    "one sees that while on average four acn molecules strongly solvate the h@xmath1 ion , their orientations may be such that the projection of their dipole moments on the @xmath107 axis can be positive or negative .",
    "in contrast , dmso clusters do not exhibit this dual dipolar orientation .",
    "conformational equilibria between clusters of distinctive geometry occur as we approach the limiting regime where clusters split into two or more independent aggregates.@xcite the interionic distance at which these phenomena are observed dependens on the cluster size . for the very small @xmath70 acn cluster case shown in fig .",
    "6 this occurs for an ion pair separation @xmath124  . at this ion pair separation",
    "one sees the two types of solvent configurations ; namely , ( a ) three molecules strongly solvating the h@xmath1 ion with the fourth solvent molecule lying farther away and solvating the cl@xmath2 ion .",
    "the other prominent configuration ( b ) occurs when all four solvent molecules strongly solvate the h@xmath1 ion .",
    "this is a transitional distance : for smaller separations one always sees the solvation structure given by ( a ) while for larger separations one always sees that corresponding to ( b ) .",
    "if one considers larger clusters analogous phenomena exist , however here we have to consider larger ion pair separations . as an example , fig .",
    "7 shows results for a @xmath121 acn cluster with the ion pair separation fixed at the very large value @xmath125  .",
    "the equilibrium structure is determined by configurations ( a ) where varying numbers of solvent molecules solvate the h@xmath1 and cl@xmath2 ions but these two solvated ions form subclusters which only weakly interact .",
    "however , there also exist equilibrium configurations ( b ) where long  strings \" of solvent molecules form a link or  rubber band \" connecting the two ions leading to a significant attractive force .",
    "this is a distinct cluster effect which has no counterpart in the bulk .",
    "such structures were observed earlier for ions of like charge in water.@xcite however , we remark that in the regime of ion pair separations investigated there is no hysteresis in the mean potential indicating that the equilibrium configuration space is being sampled fully even for the  rubber band \" configurations shown in fig .",
    "two examples of cluster structure with the ion pair at @xmath103  , the ssip configuration for dmso , are shown in fig .",
    "8 , one for acn ( top ) and the other for dmso ( bottom ) .",
    "the noteworthy features of both panels are the obvious strong orientational order near h@xmath1 for both solvent species .",
    "however note that although there is little discernible difference between the two solvent cases , ssips exist for clusters of dmso but do not for acn .",
    "these two pictures further illustrate the fact that the cluster shape fluctuations are strong and these fluctuations must be taken into account in any model of the cluster solvation dynamics .",
    "furthermore , one sees that surface forces do manifest themselves in the orientational order of the solvent molecules on the cluster surface which tend to lie parallel to the surface",
    ". however , as observed earlier , even for fairly small clusters ( @xmath121 ) there are only rather small quantitative effects on the mean potential and such surface force effects become important only at longer ion pair separations or for smaller cluster sizes .",
    "the calculations of the ionization of hcl in acn and dmso solvents indicated some of the solvation features that make the ionization process rather different in these solvents in spite of their similar dipole moments . the differences could be ascribed to the details of the charge distributions in the molecules and their effects on the quantitative aspects of the solvation structure .",
    "the gross features of the solvation structure were shown to be similar for both solvents . however , in spite of the apparent similarities in the local solvation structure , dmso supports solvent separated ion pairs while the tendency to form such pairs is considerably reduced or absent in acn .",
    "the cluster environment has an important influence on the ionization process , especially for clusters with fewer than @xmath121 molecules . for ion pair separations as large as that for the ssip state",
    ", the cluster potential of mean force closely corresponds to that of the bulk , even for clusters with as few as @xmath121 solvent molecules . for much smaller clusters ,",
    "as might be expected , there are significant changes in the mean potential reflecting the finite size of the cluster environment . of course , as the ion pair is stretched the finite size of the cluster gives rise to much more dramatic effects on the mean potential as reflected in the  rubber band \"- like solvent configurations that lead to attractive forces between the ions that can not exist in the bulk .",
    "since these forces correspond to an equilibrium cluster and involve averages over all cluster configurations with the ion pair separation fixed , they may have little relevance for ion pair dissociation processes in clusters since the time scale to establish such equilibrium structures may be long compared to typical times for dissociation .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the dynamics of dissociation in clusters in this context .    in order to estimate the importance of the explicit incorporation of the quantum nature of the proton in our calculations",
    ", we performed a series of simulations in an @xmath121 acn cluster where the proton was treated as a classical point charge .",
    "the results for the computed potential of mean force are included in fig .",
    "4 ; they clearly show the necessity to treat the proton quantum mechanically in order to accurately represent the activation free energy for ionization in these solvents .",
    "classical mechanics underestimates the barrier for passage from the cip to ssip or free ion states . in this respect ,",
    "the present behavior is opposite to that found in proton transfer reactions where quantum tunneling reduces the height of the effective free energy barrier.@xcite quantum dispersion tends to delocalize the proton charge leading to a less effective ionic solvation , as well as smaller solvation energies for dissociated ions in comparison to results from classical models where the proton is taken to be a localized point charge .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper show that acid ionization in molecular clusters can mimic that in the bulk even for quite small clusters .",
    "however , for clusters below a certain size , about @xmath121 in this study , distinctive finite - size effects influence the ionization .",
    "the study points to some of the new chemistry that can occur as a result of environmental changes on the microscopic and mesoscopic levels .",
