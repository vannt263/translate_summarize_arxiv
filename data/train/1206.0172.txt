    "the concept of monogamy is an important binding theme for quantum correlations @xcite of states shared between several quantum systems .",
    "monogamy arises due to the fact that bipartite quantum correlations of states of three or more quantum systems are usually such that if two of the parties are highly quantum correlated , these parties have little or no quantum correlations with any other party @xcite",
    ". one can assign quantum monogamy scores corresponding to multiparty quantum systems , to quantify their monogamous nature , or a possible violation thereof @xcite .",
    "such scores would typically depend on the quantum correlation measure used , and while the entanglement measure , concurrence squared @xcite , was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , the information - theoretic quantum correlation measure , quantum discord @xcite , was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the case when concurrence squared",
    "is used as a measure of quantum correlations to construct the quantum monogamy score , the class of states with vanishing scores was identified in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the case of three - qubit pure states .",
    "they constitute the important family of w - class states @xcite , complementary to the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz)-class ones @xcite .",
    "we consider the quantum monogamy score , with the quantum correlation measure being quantum discord , and call it the `` discord monogamy score '' . for arbitrary tripartite quantum states , we characterize the class possessing a vanishing discord monogamy score .",
    "we find necessary and sufficient conditions for tripartite quantum states with zero discord monogamy score .",
    "more specific results are obtained for three - qubit pure states . in particular , while none of the genuinely multiparty entangled w - class states have a vanishing discord monogamy score ( in stark contrast to the case when concurrence is used as the quantum correlation measure to build the quantum monogamy score ) , there does exist genuinely multiparty entangled ghz - class states having a zero discord monogamy score .",
    "we characterize the pure three - qubit states with zero discord monogamy score , as well as those with negative and positive values of the same , by using a measure of genuine multiparty entanglement , called generalized geometric measure ( ggm ) @xcite , and by using the mermin - klyshko bell inequalities @xcite . specifically , we find that states with a vanishing discord monogamy score can have substantially high values of genuine multisite entanglement .",
    "subsequently , however , we show that such states can not have a maximal ggm .",
    "we also find a relation between the bipartite entanglements of formation of a tripartite three - qubit state and its generalized geometric measure . it may be noted here that the discord monogamy score has been interpreted as a multiparty information - theoretic quantum correlation measure @xcite , just like the quantum monogamy score with respect to concurrence squared has been reasoned as a multiparty entanglement measure @xcite .    below , in sec .",
    "[ raat - ekhon - poune - char ] , we define the measures of bipartite quantum correlations that we use later in the paper .",

    "the considerations in sec .",

    "in this section , we define quantum correlation measures that are thereafter employed in the succeeding sections to obtain the corresponding quantum monogamy scores . these quantum monogamy scores will be helpful in formulating a classification scheme for tripartite quantum states .",
    "the entanglement of formation of a bipartite quantum state is the amount of singlets required to prepare a state by local quantum operations and classical communication .",
    "if @xmath0 is a bipartite state shared between two parties @xmath1 and @xmath2 , then it can be shown that entanglement of formation is equal to the von neumann entropy of its local density matrix @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the local density matrices of the combined system @xmath0 , obtained by performing partial traces over subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath1 respectively , and @xmath6 is the von neumann entropy of a quantum state @xmath7 .",
    "entanglement of formation of a mixed bipartite state @xmath8 is then defined by the convex - roof approach : @xmath9 where the minimization is over all pure state decompositions of @xmath10 .",
    "we often denote @xmath11 simply as @xmath12 .",
    "the concept of concurrence is derived from the definition of entanglement of formation and is proposed to quantify the entanglement of two - qubit states @xcite .",
    "the definition of entanglement of formation for mixed states ( see eq . ( [ mixeof ] ) ) involves a minimization which is in general not easy to perform .",
    "however , there exists a closed form for the case of two - qubit states @xcite , in terms of the concurrence , which is defined as @xmath13 , and often denoted below as @xmath14 . here",
    "the @xmath15 s are the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath16 in decreasing order and @xmath17 , with the complex conjugation being in the computational basis .",
    "@xmath18 is the pauli spin matrix .      in classical information theory , there are two equivalent ways to define the mutual information between two random variables .",
    "one of the methods is by adding the shannon entropies of the individual random variables , and then subtracting the same of the joint probability distribution .",
    "the second one is to use the concept of conditional entropies .",
    "quantizing these two classically equivalent definitions of mutual information gives rise to two inequivalent concepts , whose difference is termed as quantum discord @xcite .",
    "quantizing the former classical definition of mutual information is performed by replacing the shannon entropies by von neumann entropies : for a quantum state @xmath8 of two parties , the `` quantum mutual information '' is defined as @xcite ( see also @xcite ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the local density matrices of @xmath8 .",
    "quantizing the latter classical definition of mutual information is more involved , as replacing the shannon entropies by von neumann ones in this case will lead to a physical quantity which can assume negative values for some quantum states @xcite .",
    "such a shortcoming is overcome by interpreting the conditional entropy in the classical case as a measure of the lack of information about one of the random variable , when the other is known in a joint probability distribution of two random variables .",
    "this leads to the following quantization of the classical mutual information for a bipartite quantum state @xmath8 : @xmath22 where the `` quantum conditional entropy '' , @xmath23 , is defined as @xmath24 with the minimization being over all rank-1 measurements , @xmath25 , performed on subsystem @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath26 is the probability for obtaining the outcome @xmath27 , and the corresponding post - measurement state for the subsystem @xmath1 is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the identity operator on the hilbert space of the quantum system that is in possession of @xmath1 .",
    "the difference between these two inequivalent quantized version of the classical mutual information is termed as quantum discord .",
    "also , it has be established that the quantum mutual information is never lower than the quantity @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the quantum discord is given by @xcite @xmath31 unlike many other measures of quantum correlations , even separable states may produce a nonzero discord .",
    "we often denote @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "the sharing of quantum correlations among subsystems of a multiparticle quantum state is often constrained by the concept of monogamy . in the tripartite scenario , if @xmath34 is a bipartite quantum correlation measure , then this measure is said to be monogamous ( or satisfy monogamy ) for a tripartite quantum state @xmath35 , and with @xmath1 as the `` nodal observer '' , if @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the quantum correlation ( with respect to the measure @xmath38 ) between subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath39 is the quantum correlation between subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is quantum correlation between subsystem @xmath1 and subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath40 taken together . by rearranging the terms in the above inequality",
    ", we get @xmath42 this leads to the concept of quantum monogamy score , which , for a given bipartite quantum correlation measure , is defined as @xmath43 irrespective of whether it monogamous or not . in ref .",
    "@xcite , concurrence squared was used as the quantum correlation measure to define a quantum monogamy score .",

    "in this section , we provide some general features that are exhibited by states of vanishing discord monogamy score . consider a three - party quantum state , @xmath35 , which can be pure or mixed , in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "* proposition i : * for an arbitrary quantum state @xmath35 , a necessary condition for discord monogamy score to be vanishing , with @xmath1 as the nodal observer , is given by @xmath47 + ` proof . `",

    "strong subadditivity of von neumann entropy implies @xmath51 which leads us to @xmath52 which can be further simplified to obtain the stated result .",
    "@xmath53    it may be interesting to note that the vanishing of discord monogamy score is equivalent to the statement that @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the tripartite quantum interaction information @xcite .    for pure tripartite states , it is possible to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for vanishing of discord monogamy score .",
