    "theoretical physicists studied calabi - yau manifolds in order to construct conformal field theories . to obtain such a theory from the more general concept of a quantum field theory ( also via a calabi - yau manifold ) , a certain function needs to vanish ( the @xmath158-function , see @xcite ,  3.2.6.2 ) which can be enforced by taking a _ large volume limit_. since mirror symmetry is really about conformal field theories ( at least by its origin ) , taking certain limits is an important step for its understanding .",
    "there are two related types of limits we are supposed to take , namely referring to , @xmath159 both of these limits amount to rescaling the affine base manifold @xmath16 .",
    "note that these interchange under mirror symmetry : a large volume limit on @xmath1 turns into a large complex structure limit on @xmath2 and vice versa .",
    "we intend to take both limits simultaneously .",
    "one needs to be a bit careful about how this works with the right choice of a potential : let us first rescale the coordinate @xmath160 in ( b ) by @xmath161 and see how this changes everything .",

    ", this leads to @xmath165 .",
    "this is not what we want because it means that while enlarging the @xmath160-coordinates , we shrink the @xmath166-coordinates .",
    "the next option is pulling back the dual coordinates via @xmath162 , i.e. , set @xmath167 . with the previous calculation , it is easy to see that this corresponds to taking for the new potential the scaled pullback @xmath168 .",
    "3 .   finally ,",
    "in order to actually take the large volume limit simultaneously as the large complex structure limit , we need to scale the dual coordinates as well , i.e. , @xmath169 .",
    "this is realized by rescaling the pullback potential even more by taking @xmath170 .",
    "there are two types of limits that typically occur : metric limits and algebraic limits , for a discussion , see @xcite . in some sense",
    ", these are represented by the two potentials shown in fig . [ figpotentials ] .",
    "note that if we choose @xmath171 then @xmath172 , so this potential remains invariant under taking the simultaneous limit .",
    "the effect is that the base @xmath16 of @xmath102 and @xmath103 becomes longer and longer as one approaches the limit .",
    "rescaling the metric to normalize the diameter yields @xmath16 itself as a limit the calabi - yaus . for an elliptic curve with potential @xmath173 ,",
    "the metric limit is thus a circle , cf .",

    "we are interested in algebraic limits and for such , the non - self - dual second potential in figure  [ figpotentials ] is more relevant .",
    "figure  [ scalings ] illustrates how the scaling of the potential ( here by factor @xmath161 ) and the base coordinate ( here by factor @xmath174 ) influences the legendre dual and dual potential .",
    "the diagram really only shows part of all rescaling options where the remaining ones come from applying the given ones on the dual side .",
    "in fact , in view of figure  [ scalings ] , the result of scaling by @xmath161 on either side results in scaling both potentials by @xmath175 and both coordinates by @xmath161 as we did in 3 . above .",
    "there is still the degree of freedom of scaling by @xmath174 which has a reciprocal effect on the dual .",
    "this explains why the limit we gave in appears to be turned into the limit @xmath176 now . in truth , it was a limit with respect to the parameter @xmath174 .",
    "the important point is that in algebraic examples , there is a non - trivial rescaling by @xmath174 but it is non - homogenous along the base , i.e. , in some regions it looks like a contraction , in others like an expansion .",
    "we will see this in the algebraic degeneration of an elliptic curve as well as in the mirror duality of @xmath177 .",
    "it is really this rescaling which yields a discretization of the legendre transform .",
    "before we give an example , we relate @xmath161 to the algebraic coordinate : on @xmath178 , we consider the two potentials derived from @xmath179 but modified by some inhomogeneously rescaling by some @xmath174 .",

    ". of course , the geometry of @xmath478 might be very different from that of @xmath458 , e.g. , one of them might have a trivial canonical bundle while the other has a more positive one . to ensure that the geometry of @xmath477 does nt differ considerably from that of @xmath479 , we would want @xmath483 to be a crepant resolution .",
    "such does not always exist in the category of smooth schemes , however it does exist in general in the category of orbifolds which should be the slightly more general framework to be used here .",
    "while the balancing argument just given is a weak one to rectify mirror symmetry , we should actually argue by the discrete legendre transform .",
    "there are four dlts in place three of which we have seen already , see figure  [ dlts ] .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that there exists a ( non - unique ) dlt pair @xmath332 which `` dominates '' the two dlts given in .",
    "most importantly , the potentials constructed for @xmath484 , @xmath485 via the previous section agree with @xmath486 respectively in the following sense : the space @xmath484 relates to @xmath487 by a deformation , i.e. , there is a flat family with general fibre isomorphic to @xmath487 and special fibre given by @xmath484",
    ". moreover this family is birational to the trivial family with fibre @xmath487 and the potential on @xmath484 is the pullback of the potential @xmath386 from the trivial family .",
    "the mirror duality of landau - ginzburg models given in has been used in @xcite to construct mirror duals for varieties which are not necessarily fano or calabi - yau , e.g. , for varieties of general type . a notion of mirror symmetry",
    "for such varieties did nt exist before the cited work had been started , so this relatively simple construction for duals is already quite powerful .",
    "note also that the famous mirror construction of batyrev - borisov is reproducible from this duality , see @xcite .",
    "note that the potentials in loc.cit . had been permitted to have more general coefficients , i.e. , @xmath488 for some ( general ) @xmath489 and similarly for @xmath480 ( independently of the coefficients of @xmath386 ) .",
    "this can be argued to make sense by changing the ( complexified ) symplectic form on either side , recall from that the monomials are integrals of the symplectic form .",
    "there is yet one flaw in the picture : the potential which we give in is the `` naive potential '' .",
    "it agrees with the floer theoretic one in the fano case by prop .",
    "[ fanoprop ] , however @xmath477 , @xmath459 are rarely fano . more generally , there will be non - rigid rational curves in @xmath477 or @xmath459 and these cause _ disk bubbling _ and non - geometric virtual counts of holomorphic disks ( see @xcite ) .",
    "such give rise to ( possible infinitely many ) additional maslov index two holomorphic disks and thus terms in the potential . to keep this under control",
    ", the authors of @xcite required the boundary of @xmath16 and @xmath25 to be smooth .",
    "in fact they suggested to smooth the boundary by trading `` corners '' in @xmath16 ( or @xmath25 ) for singularities of the affine structure of @xmath16 ( or @xmath25 ) , see figure  [ pullincorners ] .",
    "the advantage is that the tropical potential ( the generalization of to affine manifolds with singularities ) for a smooth boundary of @xmath16 ( or @xmath25 ) seems to agree with the floer theoretic one .",
    "the additional terms arise from holomorphic disks attaching to the singularities in the syz fibration and these can be accounted for tropically .",
    "we shall study this for an example in the next section .",
    "let us record here the main result of @xcite which supports the mirror duality from a cohomological point of view .",
    "for this , the general setup of is restricted to the situation where @xmath259 has the special shape of a gorenstein cone , i.e. , there is a lattice polytope @xmath132 such that @xmath490 for this to make sense , we need to write @xmath467 as @xmath491 where @xmath492 and @xmath493 .",
    "note that the existence of a toric crepant resolution @xmath483 is equivalent with the existence of a triangulation @xmath250 of @xmath132 into simplices for which the edges emanating from a vertex in each form a basis of @xmath494 . the authors of @xcite prove the following :    assume that @xmath132 has at least one interior lattice point , @xmath495 $ ] is smooth and that there is a projective crepant toric resolution @xmath483 factoring through the blowup of the origin @xmath496 then the blow - up of the origin @xmath497 is a toric resolution .",
    "the diagram specializes to @xmath498^{\\hbox{\\tiny crepant}}\\ar[ld]_w & & { \\operatorname{tot}}({\\mathcal{o}}_{{\\mathbb{p}}_\\delta}(-1))\\ar[d]\\ar[rd]^{\\check w}\\\\ { \\mathbb{c } } & x_{\\sigma}\\ar[l]^w & & x_{\\check\\sigma}\\ar[r]_{\\check w}&{\\mathbb{c}}.\\\\ } \\ ] ] where @xmath499 denotes the total space of a line bundle .",
    "the critical locus of @xmath480 is a hypersurface @xmath500 which is smooth if the coefficients of @xmath480 were chosen general .",
    "the kodaira dimension of @xmath501 is @xmath502 where @xmath503 is the convex hull of the lattice points in the interior of @xmath132 .",
    "we have that @xmath504 is normal crossings , @xmath505 is the strict transform of the zero fibre of @xmath506 and @xmath507 are toric exceptional divisors of @xmath483 projecting to the origin .",
    "they are indexed by the lattice points in the interior of @xmath132 .",
    "the critical set near the origin @xmath508 supports the sheaf of vanishing cycles @xmath509 $ ] which carries the structure of a cohomological mixed hodge complex .",
    "denoting @xmath510 we have @xmath511 where @xmath512 .",
    "we already mentioned the concept of trading corners for singularities , see figure  [ pullincorners ] .",
    "geometrically this means the following : recall that we started our discussion with the mirror duality of @xmath0 and continued by partially compactifying it to a toric variety @xmath477 using a toric divisor @xmath513 .",
    "the special lagrangian fibration ( syz fibration ) is still entirely given on @xmath0 with parts of the torus fibres contracting towards @xmath383 .",
    "there are moduli of the pair @xmath514 by moving @xmath383 in its equivalence class , in particular @xmath383 becomes non - toric by doing so .",
    "it is not known whether @xmath515 for such a non - toric @xmath383 still supports a special lagrangian fibration ( using for @xmath15 a section of @xmath516 ) .",
    "this is already unknown for the complement of a smooth cubic in @xmath234 .",
    "nonetheless , we already have a good expectation of what the affine base of such a special lagrangian fibration should look like . in the case of @xmath234",
    ", we depicted it on the right of figure  [ pullincorners ] .",
    "see @xcite for a treatment of the case of a partial smoothing of the hyperplanes in @xmath234 , see also @xcite .",
    "what happens to the mirror as we smooth @xmath383 ?",
    "we have a natural bijection between the components of @xmath383 and the terms in the potential of the mirror @xmath517 , so by smoothing @xmath383 , we expect only one monomial to contribute to the mirror potential near @xmath383 .",
    "on the other hand , the special lagrangian fibration on @xmath515 - should such exist - or at least the affine model for its base acquires singularities there are additional disks attaching to these singularities and to @xmath383 .",
    "it can be checked in simple fano examples that the monomials in the potential remain the same ( up to changing coefficents ) when smoothing the toric boundary divisor .",
    "summing over rays in is replaced by summing over _ broken lines _ in the presence of singularities @xcite , see figure  [ raystobrokenlines ] .",
    "the singularities emanate walls ( indicated dashed in fig .",
    "[ raystobrokenlines ] ) into the affine manifold which ought to contain the image of maslov index zero holomorphic disks under the syz map @xmath103 should such exist .",
    "these can be attached to the holomorphic disk touching @xmath383 and give rise to further terms in the potential .",
    "as long as @xmath383 itself does not contribute such walls , the tropical potential obtained in this way by counting broken lines is expected to be the correct potential meaning that it agrees with the one given in .",
    "moreover the smoothing of @xmath383 makes @xmath386 proper as has been argued in @xcite .",
    "the process of pulling in the corners is very ad hoc and hasnt been systematized yet .",
    "this will be treated in @xcite . in non - fano cases , where prop .",
    "[ fanoprop ] possibly fails , the right count of holomorphic disks seems more accessible when the boundary divisor has been smoothed by means of counting broken lines .",
    "we close this article by studying the corner - pull - in - process in an example :    let @xmath518 with @xmath132 an interval of length @xmath519 and @xmath269 be the unique subdivision giving a crepant resolution of @xmath479 . let @xmath270 be the dual cone of @xmath259 and @xmath456 be the fan of @xmath520 which resolves @xmath521 . see figure  [ intervaldlts ] for a how the diagram in figure  [ dlts ] visualizes for this setup .",
    "we start from the dlt pair @xmath332 and straighten out the boundary in these each at a time .",
    "see this process in figure  [ straighten ] .",
    "even though we started with very simple cones , we eventually obtain a fairly interesting dlt pair whose singularities will feature scattering .",
    "the upshot of this example is that the corrections that come to the potentials do nt impact the critical locus of the potential .",
    "this can be deduced from the positions of the invariant directions of the singularities towards the direction of the boundary divisor in the respective cone pictures .",
    "the critical loci together with the sheaf of vanishing cycles were the main objects of study in @xcite .",
