    "one of the most convincing manifestations of the difference between the bcs scenario and superconductivity in the cuprates is the pseudogap , or the depletion of a single particle spectral weight around the fermi level @xcite .",
    "this is observed mainly in the underdoped cuprates where the pseudogap opens in the normal state as the temperature @xmath1 decreases below the crossover temperature @xmath2 and extends over a wide range of @xmath1 .",
    "due to the complex nature of cuprate systems , there are a number of theoretical explanations for the pseudogap behavior .",
    "one of them is based on the model of a nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid @xcite .",
    "another possible explanation relates the pseudogap to spin- and/or charge - density waves @xcite .",
    "a third direction , which we take in this paper , argues that precursor superconducting fluctuations may be responsible for the pseudogap phenomena .",
    "indeed an incoherent pair tunneling experiment @xcite proposed recently may allow one to answer whether the superconducting fluctuations are really responsible for the pseudogap behavior .",
    "furthermore , one can not exclude the possibility that the pseudogap is the result of a combination of various mechanisms , e.g. , both spin and superconducting fluctuations .",
    "the precursor superconducting fluctuations have recently been extensively studied using different approaches . in most cases ,",
    "the attractive 2d or 3d hubbard model was considered . in particular",
    "this model has been studied , both analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite , in the conserving @xmath1-matrix approximation that is `` @xmath3 derivable '' in the sense of baym @xcite .",
    "the non `` @xmath3 derivable '' @xmath1-matrix approximation was considered in @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the pseudogap is related to the resonant pair scattering of correlated electrons above @xmath0 . for the d - wave pairing",
    ", the pseudogap was also studied in @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) and monte carlo simulations for the 2d attractive hubbard model were performed in @xcite .",
    "it is known , however , that while the @xmath1-matrix approximation provides an adequate description of 3d systems at all temperatures , including the superconducting state with a long - range order , it fails ( see , for example , @xcite ) to describe the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition into the state with an algebraic order , which is only possible in 2d systems .",
    "this is why , in most of the papers cited above , the @xmath1-matrix approximation was used to study either 3d systems @xcite or 2d systems above @xmath0 @xcite in order to avoid the bkt transition , even though it is generally accepted that 2d models are more relevant for the description of cuprates @xcite .    of course , the superconducting transition itself is not of the bkt type , because even a weak interplanar coupling produces a transition in the @xmath4 xy universality class , sufficiently close to the transition temperature . outside the transition region , however , the low - energy physics is governed by vortex fluctuations @xcite , and one can expect the 2d model to be especially relevant for the description of the pseudogap phase .",
    "this was confirmed for the quasi-2d model @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "regarding the pseudogap , it is sufficient to consider the case where @xmath5 .",
    "however , one definitely needs an approach different from the @xmath1-matrix if one wants to study the 2d theory for the entire temperature range and wants to connect the pseudogap to the superconducting gap .",
    "an alternative approach overcoming the above difficulty was proposed in @xcite . for a 2d system",
    ", one should rewrite the complex order field @xmath6 in terms of its modulus @xmath7 and its phase @xmath8 as @xmath9 $ ] , which was originally suggested by witten in the context of 2d quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "it is impossible to obtain @xmath10 at finite @xmath1 because this would correspond to the formation of symmetry breaking homogeneous long - range order , which is forbidden by the coleman ",
    "mermin  wagner",
    " hohenberg ( cmwh ) theorem @xcite . however , it is possible to obtain @xmath11 with @xmath12 \\rangle = 0 $ ] at the same time because of random fluctuations of the phase @xmath8 ( i.e. , because of transverse fluctuations of the order field originating in the modulus conservation principle @xcite ) .",
    "we stress that @xmath13 does not imply any long - range superconducting order ( which is destroyed by phase fluctuations ) and , therefore , does not contradict the abovementioned theorem .    for the simple model studied in @xcite ,",
    "there are three regions in the 2d phase diagram .",
    "the first one is the superconducting ( here , bkt ) phase with @xmath14 at @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the bkt transition temperature , which plays the role of @xmath0 in pure 2d superconducting systems . in this region",
    ", there is an algebraic order or a power law decay of the @xmath17 correlations .",
    "the second region corresponds to the so - called pseudogap phase ( @xmath18 ) , where @xmath19 is the temperature at which @xmath20 is supposed to become zero . in this phase , @xmath20 is still non - zero , but the above correlations decay exponentially .",
    "the third is the normal ( fermi - liquid ) phase at @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "note that @xmath3 and all the symmetry violating correlators like @xmath23 vanish everywhere .",
    "the proposed description of the phase fluctuations and the bkt transition is very similar to that given by emery and kivelson @xcite .",
    "however , the field @xmath7 does not appear the phenomenological approach of @xcite , while in the present microscopic approach it occurs naturally .",
    "we also mention here the application of similar ideas to the 3d case @xcite , where instead of the 2d temperature @xmath16 one has the phase transition temperature in the 3d xy - model , @xmath24 .",
    "the main quantity of interest in the present paper is the one - fermion green s function and the associated spectral function @xmath25 . the second quantity , being proportional to the intensity of the angle - resolved photoemission spectrum ( arpes ) @xcite , encodes information about the pseudogap and quasiparticles .",
    "following the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite the green s function for the charged ( physical ) fermions is given by the convolution ( in momentum space ) of the propagator for neutral fermions ( which has a gap @xmath26 ) and the fourier transform of the phase correlator @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the approximation employed here assumes the absence of coupling between spin and charge degrees of freedom ; this can be taken into account at the next stage of approximation .",
    "we demonstrate that the quasiparticle spectral function broadens considerably when passing from the superconducting to the normal state , as observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the phase fluctuations result in a non - fermi liquid behavior of the system both below and above @xmath16 .",
    "we note that the effect of classical phase fluctuations of the order field on the spectral properties of underdoped cuprates has also been analyzed by franz and millis @xcite .",
    "being experimentally motivated , they could show that the corresponding photoemission and tunneling data are well accounted for by a simple model where @xmath28-wave charge excitations are coupled to supercurrent fluctuations .",
    "a brief overview of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : form ] , we present the modulus - phase formalism for the fermion green s function and explain why it is so important to use this formalism for the description of 2d models . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phase.green ] , we obtain and discuss the green s function of phase fluctuations both below and above @xmath16 .",
    "this expression is then used in sec .",
    "[ sec : green.fermion ] to derive the temperature and retarded fermion green s functions .",
    "we show that this green s function exhibits a non - fermi liquid behavior . in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectral ] , we obtain an analytic expression for the spectral density of the fermion green s function and discuss this result in detail .",
    "the density of states ( dos ) is considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : dos ]",
    ". appendix  [ sec : a ] contains technical details on the calculation of the long - distance asymptotic behavior of the phase correlator .",
    "appendix  [ sec : b ] contains the derivation of an alternative representation for the fermion green s function which is useful in calculating the spectral density .",
    "the integrals for the dos are given in appendix  [ sec : c ] .",
    "[ sec : form ] our starting point is a continuum version of the two - dimensional attractive hubbard model defined by the hamiltonian density @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the space and imaginary time variables , @xmath31 is a fermion field with the spin @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the effective fermion mass , @xmath34 is the chemical potential , and @xmath35 is an effective local attraction constant ; we take @xmath36 .",
    "the model with the hamiltonian density ( [ hamilton ] ) is equivalent to the model with an auxiliary bcs - like pairing field , which can be written as @xmath37\\psi(x)+ \\frac{|\\phi(x)|^2}{v}\\ ] ] in terms of nambu variables @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the pauli matrices and @xmath41 is the complex order field .",
    "we consider the full fermion green s function in the matsubara finite temperature formalism @xmath42 for the 3d case of the bcs theory , the frequency - momentum representation for ( [ green.def ] ) in the mean field approximation is known to be @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the odd ( fermion ) matsubara frequency , @xmath45 is the dispersion law of electrons evaluated from the chemical potential @xmath34 , and @xmath46 is the complex order parameter .",
    "a problem arises when one tries to apply eq .",
    "( [ green.standard ] ) directly to 2d systems , since it has been proved ( see @xcite ) that nonzero @xmath3 values are forbidden .",
    "nevertheless , one can assume that the modulus of the order parameter @xmath47 has a nonzero value , while its phase @xmath8 defined by @xmath48 } \\label{phase.def}\\ ] ] is a random quantity . to be consistent with ( [ phase.def ] ) one",

    "the strategy of treating charge and spin ( neutral ) degrees of freedom as independent seems to be quite useful , and at the same time a very general feature of 2d systems @xcite .    applying ( [ nambu.phase ] ) , we thus split the green s function ( [ green.def ] ) into spin and charge parts @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the green s function for neutral fermions . introducing the projectors @xmath53 we obtain @xmath54 so that ( [ green.splited ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath55 \\exp [ - i\\beta\\theta(0)/2 ] \\rangle , \\label{green.projectors}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 correspond to the diagonal and non - diagonal parts of the green s function , respectively .    for the frequency - momentum representation of ( [ green.projectors ] ) we have @xmath58 where @xmath59 { \\cal g}(\\tau , \\mbox{\\bf r } ) \\label{green.neutral.fourier}\\ ] ] and @xmath60   \\exp [ - i\\beta \\theta(0 ) / 2 ] \\rangle \\label{green.phase.fourier}\\ ] ] is the correlator of phase fluctuations with even ( boson ) frequencies @xmath61 .",
    "there is a good reason to believe ( see @xcite ) that for @xmath1 close to @xmath16 , the fluctuations of the order parameter modulus @xmath20 ( the so  called longitudinal fluctuations , which in fact correspond to carrier density fluctuations and undoubtedly must be taken into account in the very underdoped region ) @xcite are irrelevant and one can safely use the green s function ( [ green.neutral.fourier ] ) of the neutral fermions in the mean - field approximation ( compare with ( [ green.standard ] ) ) @xmath62 here @xmath63 with @xmath64 being a 2d vector and @xmath65 . note that in @xcite , @xmath7 was treated only in the mean - field approximation , which means that fluctuations in both @xmath7 and @xmath8 were neglected , and therefore a second - order phase transition was obtained at @xmath66 .",
    "however , as stressed in introduction , experimentally the formation of the pseudogap phase does not display any sharp transition and the temperature @xmath2 observed in various experiments is to be considered as a characteristic energy scale , rather than as a temperature where the pseudogap is reduced to zero @xcite .",
    "we believe that taking the @xmath7 fluctuations into account may resolve the discrepancy between the experimental behavior of @xmath2 and the temperature @xmath66 introduced in the theory .",
    "[ sec : phase.green ]    as stated above , we expect the phase fluctuations to be responsible for the difference between properties of the charged and neutral fermions defined above .",
    "the latter are described by the green s function ( [ green.neutral ] ) , which coincides with the bcs green s function ( [ green.standard ] ) only under the assumption that the phase @xmath67 of the order parameter @xmath68 is a constant and can be chosen to vanish .",
    "this is not the case for the 2d model , where there is a decay of the phase correlations and the green s functions of charged and neutral fermions are nontrivially related via eq .",

    "the value of @xmath106 for cuprates is less than the brillouin momentum @xmath97 , which is why the first case in ( [ asymptotic ] ) seems to be more relevant .",

    "the same effect can also be reached when the interaction between the charge and spin degrees of the freedom is taken into account @xcite .",

    "on the other hand , as stated above , there also are indications @xcite that a filling of the gap can be obtained by considering the dynamical phase fluctuations only . at present , it is not clear which of these gap filling mechanisms plays the main role ; this is the subject of our current investigations .",

    "this is caused by the fact that @xmath258 since @xmath259 is already finite due to the influence of the vortex fluctuations .",
    "as the temperature is increases further , @xmath259 decreases , so that the quasiparticle peaks disappear ( compare figs .  2 and 3 ) .",
    "this behavior qualitatively reproduces the arpes studies of the cuprates for the anti - node direction @xcite ( see also @xcite ) which show that the quasiparticle spectral function broadens dramatically when passing from the superconducting to normal state .",
    "it is important to stress that due to a very smooth dependence of @xmath260 on @xmath1 ( see eq .",

    "this qualitatively fits the experiment @xcite and appears to be completely different from the bcs theory @xcite , where the gap vanishes at @xmath264 . as was already mentioned , the gap obtained at @xmath238 takes place in the static approximation only and begins to be filled after dynamical fluctuations are taken into account ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",

    "this and a nonzero value of @xmath260 above @xmath16 may explain the break at @xmath265 in the scattering rate @xmath266 introduced in @xcite . in general , it is interesting to establish a correspondence between the phenomenological parameters , @xmath266 and @xmath267 introduced in @xcite and the vortex parameters @xmath259 and @xmath124 used here .",

    "it could also be that both these mechanisms are physically equivalent , since they relate the gap filling to the presence of vortices in the system .",
    "since we used the mean - field dependence @xmath268 , it is clear that the distance between the quasiparticle peaks ( which is approximately equal to @xmath269 ) diminishes as @xmath1 increases .",

    "to summarize , we have derived analytic expressions for the fermion green s function , its spectral density , and the density of states in the modulus - phase representation for the simplest 2d attractive hubbard model with the @xmath150-wave nonretarded attractive interaction .",

    ", our approach allowed us to establish a direct relationship between the superconducting fluctuations and the non - fermi liquid behavior in a very natural and transparent way .",
    "also , it relates the pseudogap to the `` soup '' of fluctuating vortices ( see also @xcite ) , while @xcite emphasises the existence of metastable pairs above @xmath284 .",
    "it is possible that both these pictures capture some physics , but in the different regions of the temperatures .",
    "when @xmath1 is high and close to @xmath2 , the value of @xmath20 is small , so that @xmath20-fluctuations or metastable pairs dominate .",
    "then as the temperature approaches @xmath16 , the values of @xmath20 and the phase stiffness @xmath76 are growing bigger , so that the vortex excitations dominate and @xmath20-fluctuations become less important .",
    "we stress once more that the vortex excitations can not be adequately described within @xmath1-matrix approximation @xcite .",
    "recently the last part of this picture was supported experimentally @xcite by the measurements of the screening and dissipation of a high - frequency electromagnetic field in bismuth - cuprate films .",
    "these measurements provide evidence for a phase - fluctuation driven transition from the superconducting to normal state .",
