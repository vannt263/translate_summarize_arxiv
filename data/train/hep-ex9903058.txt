    "in the past seven years , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the accepted theory of quark and gluon interactions , has been confronted with a set of precise and varied measurements of jet production from the fermi national accelerator laboratory proton  antiproton collider . in @xmath0 collisions ,",
    "jet production can be understood as a point  like collision of a quark or gluon from the proton and a quark or gluon from the antiproton . after colliding , these scattered partons manifest themselves as sprays of particles or `` jets '' .",
    "the extremely high energy of these interactions provides an excellent opportunity to test our understanding of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "in particular , differences between qcd calculations and measured jet processes reveal information about both the partonic content of the proton and the nature of the strong interaction .",
    "further , unexpected deviations may signal the existence of new particles or interactions down to distance scales of @xmath1 meters or less .",
    "historically , jet measurements have involved tests of qcd at the highest energies and searches for new physics . prior to 1992 , the inclusive jet cross section , one of the most important hadron collider results , had been measured at the isr @xmath2 collider at a center  of  mass energy of @xmath3 gev @xcite , the cern @xmath0 collider at 546 and 630 gev @xcite , and the fermilab tevatron @xmath0 collider at 1800 gev  @xcite .",
    "these data span a factor of twenty in beam energy and a factor of two hundred in jet energy transverse to the proton beam ( @xmath4 ) and , in general , are reasonably well described by qcd .",
    "studies of the correlations between the leading two jets of an interaction also test qcd and provide opportunities to search for new physics . measurements of dijet distributions prior to 1992 , such as the invariant mass of the leading two jets or the angular separation between the jets , are also in good agreement with qcd @xcite . using the model of eichten , lane , and peskin  @xcite",
    "these data are used to search for composite quarks  @xcite , with the best limits coming from an inclusive jet cross section measurement  @xcite . in this model excess jet production at large relative to qcd",
    "is interpreted as the product of quark constituent scattering . because these data sets are relatively small",
    "all searches are limited by statistical precision rather than systematic uncertainties at the highest @xmath4",
    ". a summary of these inclusive jet and dijet results can be found in the review of qcd by huth and mangano  @xcite .    in 1992 , with the advent of high luminosity data collection at the tevatron , a new era of precise @xmath0 jet physics began . from 19921993",
    "( run 1a ) each of the two collider experiments accumulated @xmath5 20 @xmath6 of data and from 19941996 ( run 1b ) each accumulated @xmath5 100 @xmath6 .",
    "both data sets were taken at @xmath7 1800 gev . at the end of run 1b a small portion of data ( @xmath5 600 @xmath8 )",
    "was taken at @xmath7 630 gev .",
    "the two runs together represent a data set @xmath5 50 times larger than any preceding data set .",
    "in contrast to previous tests of qcd , the run 1 jet measurements have statistical uncertainties significantly smaller than experimental or theoretical systematic uncertainties .",
    "in fact , the inclusive jet analysis from the run 1a sample yielded a significant discrepancy between data and contemporaneous theoretical predictions as well as good agreement with previous measurements @xcite .",
    "in addition to stimulating great excitement over the possibility of departures from qcd , the result motivated a re  evaluation of the uncertainties associated with inclusive jet cross section calculations  @xcite .",
    "later measurements of the inclusive jet cross section using the run 1b samples stimulated further discussions since one confirmed  @xcite the run 1a measurement while the other was well described by qcd .",
    "in addition , subsequent studies have indicated that qcd can describe the observed run 1a cross section through adjustments to the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , which represent the fraction of proton momentum carried by the constituent quarks and gluons .",
    "independent of the actual high @xmath4 behavior of the inclusive jet cross section , the run 1a and 1b results have revealed large uncertainties in the theoretical predictions . in particular , the pdfs are derived from fits to data from many different experiments , all of which are collected at low energy and extrapolated to tevatron jet energies .",
    "representation of the uncertainties in the resulting pdfs is a complex issue and has never been precisely resolved .",
    "consequently , the tevatron collaborations have taken an interest in derivation of the pdfs from information collected at the tevatron .",
    "measurements of dijet mass distributions and dijet cross sections at a variety of scattering angles provide information on the momentum distributions of the partons . by comparing the different measurements , constraints on the pdfs",
    "can be established , and sensitivity to the presence of new physics should ultimately be improved .",
    "this review opens with a description of the theoretical framework behind perturbative qcd and a discussion of the uncertainties associated with predictions .",
    "descriptions of the two detectors in which these measurements were performed and jet reconstruction algorithms are also provided .",
    "the review then devotes a section each to the run 1 measurements of the inclusive jet cross section , the ratio of inclusive cross sections at different beam energies , dijet differential cross sections , and dijet mass and angular distributions .",
    "as will be seen , these measurements offer a detailed look into the composition of the proton and the nature of the strong interaction .",
    "a conclusion summarizes the results and suggests future avenues of research .",
    "the proton  antiproton interaction , a fairly general scattering process , nicely introduces the concepts of leading order and next  to  leading order pqcd . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ order ] , inelastic scattering between a proton and an antiproton can be described as an elastic collision between a single proton constituent and single antiproton constituent .",
    "these constituents are collectively referred to as partons and in qcd are quarks and gluons .",
    "the non  colliding constituents of the incoming proton and anti  proton are called beam fragments or spectators .",
    "predictions for jet production are given by folding experimentally determined parton distribution functions @xmath9 with perturbatively calculated two  body scattering cross sections @xmath10 .",
    "see , for example , reference  @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "the two ingredients can be formally combined to calculate any cross section of interest :    @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "the parton distribution functions @xmath12 describe the momentum fraction @xmath13 of the incident hadron momentum @xmath14 carried by a parton of type @xmath15 ( gluons or quarks ) .",
    "the pdf is defined in terms of the factorization scale @xmath16 .",
    "the hard two  body cross section is a function of the momentum carried by each of the incident partons @xmath17 , the strong coupling parameter @xmath18 , the scale @xmath19 characterizing the energy of the hard interaction , and the renormalization scale @xmath20 .",
    "final state partons manifest themselves as collimated streams or `` jets '' of particles .",
    "this formal description includes no explicit hadronization or fragmentation functions to describe the transition from partons to jets . for most high @xmath4 measurements these effects",
    "are small and jets are identified as partons .    the two  body scattering has been illustrated in fig .",
    "[ order ] with a leading order ( lo ) graph .",
    "the cross section for this process is proportional to two powers of the strong coupling parameter , @xmath18 , which come from the two vertices .",
    "although useful , the lo picture is too simple and has large normalization uncertainties .",
    "next  to  leading order ( nlo ) or o@xmath21 calculations include one additional parton emission .",
    "a schematic example is shown in the second illustration of fig .",
    "[ order ] .",
    "here a final state quark has radiated an additional gluon and the entire scattering process is proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "depending on the proximity of the other partons , a  jet \" could result from one or two ( combined ) partons .",
    "this in turn results in parton level predictions for the shape of jets , and for the effects of clustering parameters .",
    "= 5.0 in = 2.5 in    a complete theoretical prediction of jet production should not depend on internal calculational details ; however , this is not the case for fixed order perturbative qcd , which depends on the choice of factorization and renormalization scales .",
    "the factorization scale , a free parameter , determines how the contributions of initial state radiation are factorized between the pdfs and @xmath10 .",
    "the renormalization scale is also arbitrary and is related to choices in the theoretical calculations designed to control or renormalize ultraviolet singularities .",
    "typically , as in this report , @xmath20 and @xmath16 are set equal to each other , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is chosen to be of the same order as @xmath19 .",
    "the sensitivity of the theoretical predictions to @xmath24 is often taken as a measure of the uncertainty from the contributions of higher order terms .",
    "predictions for jet production at nlo have been derived by ellis , kunszt , and soper @xcite ; aversa _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ; and giele , glover , and kosower @xcite .",
    "the nlo predictions are much less sensitive to the choice of @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "the `` eks '' program by ellis , kunszt , and soper  @xcite can generate analytic predictions for jet cross sections as a function of final state parameters .",
    "the `` jetrad '' program by giele , glover , and kosower  @xcite generates weighted `` events '' with final state partons .",
    "cross sections are calculated by generating a large number of events as a function of final state parameters .",
    "all predictions in this document have been generated either with or jetrad .",
    "the two programs agree within a few percent@xcite .",
    "a nlo qcd calculation requires selection of several input parameters including specification of a parton clustering algorithm , a perturbative scale , and pdfs .",
    "taken together these choices can result in approximately 30% variations in the theoretical predictions .",
    "the single largest uncertainty is due to the pdfs .",
    "these input choices and the resultant changes in the predictions are discussed in the following paragraphs .",
    "the variations are illustrated by comparing predictions for the inclusive jet cross section .",
    "as in the experimental results to follow , the cross section is reported as a function of jet and pseudorapidity @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the angle between the jet and the proton beam , and is summed over @xmath27 , the azimuthal angle around the beam . for reference , @xmath28 for jet production at 90 degrees relative to the proton beam .",
    "the nlo predictions may include two or three final state partons .",
    "to convert the partons to the equivalent of jets measured in a detector , a clustering algorithm is employed .",
    "the snowmass cone algorithm  @xcite was proposed as a way to minimize the difference between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements . in theory calculations , two partons which fall within a cone of radius r in @xmath29@xmath27 space (",
    "r = @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the separation of the partons in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle ) are combined into a  jet \" .",
    "a standard cone radius of @xmath33 0.7 is used by both collider experiments for most measurements .",
    "a consequence of this algorithm is that partons have to be at least a distance of 2r apart to be considered as separate jets .",
    "subsequent studies indicated that the experimental clustering algorithms ( described in later sections ) were more efficient at separating nearby jets  @xcite than the idealized snowmass algorithm .",
    "in other words , two jets would be identified even though they were separated by less than 2r .",
    "an additional parameter , @xmath34 , was introduced in the qcd predictions to mimic the experimental effects of cluster merging and separation .",
    "partons within @xmath35 were merged into a jet , while partons separated by more than @xmath35 were identified as two individual jets . as described in detail in the references ,",
    "a value of @xmath34 = 1.3 was found to give the best agreement with the data for cross section and jet shape measurements @xcite .",
    "this corresponds in the data to the 50% efficiency point in jet separation  @xcite , i.e. two jets within @xmath34=1.3 of one another are merged 50% of the time and identified as two individual jets 50% of the time . at separations of 1.0r",
    "the algorithms nearly always merge the two jets and at values of 1.6r they nearly always identify two separate jets .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ theory_err ] shows the change in the prediction for the inclusive jet cross section using the eks program when @xmath34 is decreased from 2 to 1.3 .",
    "the result is primarily a normalization change of 5 to 7% .",
    "= 4.0 in = 2.5 in      because a nlo calculation is truncated at order @xmath36 there is some residual dependence on the scale @xmath24 at which the calculation is performed .",
    "the scale is usually taken to be proportional to @xmath37 ( or just @xmath4 ) , maximum transverse jet energy @xmath38 in a given event , or the total center  of  mass energy . other choices for the scale are possible . to study the scale dependence of the predictions , the magnitude of the scale is varied by a multiplicative coefficient , common choices are @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ theory_err ] shows a mild dependence at the 29% level on the definition of the scale .",
    "the lowest panel shows that typical variations of the multiplicative coefficient lead to 520% shifts in the cross section with only small changes in shape above 100 gev .",
    "parton distribution functions are derived from global fits to data primarily from deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) fixed target and electron  proton collider experiments . in dis",
    ", a lepton probe is used to sample the partonic structure of the target hadrons . for use at the tevatron",
    ", the resulting distributions must be evolved from the low energy dis results to the high energy range of jet measurements .",
    "as the data from dis experiments increases and improves , new parton distribution functions are derived .",
    "some recent pdfs also incorporate data from the tevatron .",
    "the result is a plethora of pdfs , each with its own specific list of data included in the fit , assumptions as to the value of @xmath41 , functional forms for the quark and gluon momentum distributions , and assumptions concerning the contributions of the gluons , which are not constrained by the dis results .",
    "the most recent pdfs include the most precise data and combined knowledge , and supplant the previous pdfs .",

    "the individual pdfs represent the range of predictions resulting from changes in one of the input assumptions such as the value of @xmath41 .",

    "[ pdf_err ] the pdfs can result in @xmath5 20% variations in jet cross sections ; typical variations within a set are on the order of 510% .",

    "both the cdf and d0 algorithms are based on the snowmass algorithm , but the reality of jets of hadrons measured by a finitely segmented calorimeter necessitates the introduction of additional steps and cuts .",
    "apart from small definitional details , the most significant difference between the snowmass algorithm and its experimental implementations is the handling of cluster merging and separation . to simulate these effects in the nlo calculations the @xmath34 parameter was introduced .",

    "the inclusive jet and dijet cross sections provide fundamental tests of qcd predictions at the highest jet @xmath4 and thus are the deepest probes into the structure of the proton . with the increased luminosity performance of the tevatron ,",

    "in fact , the systematic uncertainties from the experimental measurements and from the theoretical predictions are comparable in size and are significantly larger than the statistical uncertainty on all but the highest @xmath4 data points .",
    "uncertainties in the pdfs dominate the theoretical uncertainty , while uncertainties in the jet energy scale dominate the experimental measurements .",
    "the inclusive jet cross sections from the tevatron have proved a particularly interesting test of qcd .",

    "two subsequent measurements , each using five times the data , show mixed agreement between the data and theory at high @xmath4 .",

    "unfortunately this sample is too statistically limited to provide a constraint on the high @xmath4 behavior of the cross section at 1800 gev .",
    "the apparent excess of events at high @xmath4 observed in the inclusive jet cross section from run 1a created intense scrutiny of the theoretical predictions . as a result , there is now a better understanding of the uncertainty in the theoretical predictions , particularly for the parton distribution functions .",
    "the dijet mass distributions and differential cross sections reflect a story similar to the inclusive jet measurements .",

    "incorporation of this information into the global fitting procedures used to derive the pdfs should be particularly helpful in reducing the uncertainty associated with extrapolation from low energy dis data to the kinematic region covered by the tevatron jet measurements .",
    "until the uncertainty in the pdfs is reduced , or a method of analytically evaluating their uncertainties is available , the best limits on compositeness will come from measurements insensitive to the pdfs , and in particular , measurements that rely on angular information .",
    "these angular distributions show the partonic hard scattering to be well described by nlo theoretical calculations .",
    "comparisons of the angular and mass data to jet production models augmented by quark compositeness show no preference for deviations from standard qcd predictions .",
    "in fact , the analyses now show that the compositeness scale must be greater than 2.5 tev if it exists at all .",
    "the high precision tevatron jet data has fostered a period of great progress in qcd . due to the flexibility of theoretical predictions ,",
    "pqcd can describe nearly all inclusive jet and dijet observations .",
    "limits on quark substructure from run 1 have nearly doubled from the previous measurements .",
    "however , more stringent tests will require improved pdfs and reduced theoretical uncertainties . looking forward ,",
    "expectations are high that the experimental measurements of jets and their properties will continue to improve in run 2 with a 20fold increase in data sample size , increased beam energy , and reduced systematic uncertainties from the upgraded detectors .",
