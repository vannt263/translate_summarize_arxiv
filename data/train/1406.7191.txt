    "it is generally recognized that there is one - to - one correspondence between the presence of nontrivial topological invariants characterizing the bulk electron states of a crystal and the appearance of specific electron modes localized at the crystal boundary @xcite .",
    "this statement , which is known as the bulk - boundary correspondence theorem , reflects profound interrelation between the interior and exterior electron states of the truncated crystal .",
    "while the formulated assertion is based on general arguments of the topological concept for solids , in real materials and/or heterostructures , the effect of the peculiar bulk properties on the surface may be quite intricate .",
    "this problem has been widely discussed in the context of an existence of topological bound states on the surface of a three - dimensional topological insulator ( 3d ti ) or at the interface between 3d ti and topologically trivial material in various hybrid structures@xcite .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectra have given evidence for the dirac - like dispersion and the momentum - dependent spin texture of the 3d ti surface states in a family of bi- and sb - based narrow - gap semiconductors with strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) @xcite , which leads to the inverted band structure characterized by nontrivial topological invariants .",
    "although the topologically protected surface states are often considered as the most important and even decisive property of 3d tis , in practice , the specific manifestations of the boundary - related electron properties in semiconductor materials with an inverted energy gap go far beyond the bulk - boundary correspondence paradigm .",
    "in other words , being formally correct , the topological arguments tell us too little about characteristics of the topologically protected surface / interface states ( e.g. , the details of the dispersion , actual length scale , spin texture ) or what other in - gap electron states might form at the real boundary of a 3d ti material .",
    "while a rapid progress has been made in investigations of the vacuum - terminated ti surfaces @xcite , it is still challenging to control the properties of the dirac states under the surface modification in complex situations when a 3d ti is brought into the contact with some substances .",
    "recent experiments on 3d tis have demonstrated that these states are notably sensitive to external perturbations , such as chemical doping of the surface via deposition of both magnetic and nonmagnetic elements @xcite , oxidation of air - exposed samples @xcite , change of the surface termination @xcite , capping layers and interfaces with other materials @xcite , applying an external gate voltage @xcite , etc .",
    "perturbation of a bulk crystal potential exists naturally in truncated crystals and , in particular , 3d tis , and creates a surface potential ( sp ) affecting electron properties of a crystal near / at the surface . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was argued that a bulk - truncated surface of bismuth - chalcogenides can develop complex electronic structure in which the dirac states coexist with the conventional states of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in the quantum well appearing near the 3d ti surface due to the band - bending effect .",

    "calculations  @xcite have shown that an expansion of the van - der - waals ( vdw ) spacing in layered 3d tis caused by intercalation of deposited atoms leads to a simultaneous emergence of 2deg bands localized in the subsurface region .",
    "moreover , the expansion of the vdw spacing also leads to a relocation of the dirac topological states to the lower quintuple layers  @xcite .",
    "wang  _ et al _ have studied the effects of surface modification on the topological surface state in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 using first - principles calculations and shown that bi - capping and se - removing can move the dirac point upwards and slow flatten the topological surface bands  @xcite .",

    "@xcite it was suggested that the dirac point of the helical surface states can be significantly shifted by applying uniaxial strain .",

    "they found that the probability maximum of the dirac state largely moves from the topologically nontrivial bi@xmath0se@xmath1 into the region of the topologically trivial sb@xmath0se@xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "arpes experiments  @xcite provide the direct evidence that the surface state of top surface of the heterostructure containing single quintuple layer ( ql ) of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 on 19qls of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 is similar to the surface state of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the transport measurements  @xcite show that the studied heterostructure behaves more like bi@xmath0se@xmath1 even though there is only 1ql bi@xmath0se@xmath1 layer grown on 19qls bi@xmath0te@xmath1 . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was established that , as a result of depositing a 3d ni overlayer ( conventional semiconductor znm , m = s , se , and te ) onto the 3d ti substrate ( bi@xmath0se@xmath1 or bi@xmath0te@xmath1 ) , the topological states can float to the top of the ni film , or stay put at the ni / ti interface , or are pushed down deeper into 3d ti .",

    "thus , the experimental and theoretical data exhibit that the real 3d ti surface and 3d ti / ni interface possess very rich and diverse physics , in particular , they can hold both topological and non - topological ( ordinary ) in - gap states .",
    "it is well known that the non - topological bound states can be created or deleted or altered , depending on the both the sign and strength of sp , when 3d ni is exposed to ambient conditions or put into the contact with other materials . on the contrary , in 3d ti ,",
    "the topological order itself is robust against such the influences so that it can be completely destroyed only under the drastic perturbation  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the parameters of the topological states can undergo remarkable changes with even moderate external perturbations .",
    "combination of the robustness of the topological states at the ti / ni interfaces with the tunability of their parameters to the external influence favours the design of the 3d ti / ni layered systems possessing suitable band structure , charge distribution and spin texture .",
    "the efficient design of the 3d ti / ni systems can be realized by combining analytic and numerical methods .    in the present work",
    ", we consider a special type of the 3d ti / ni heterostructures of particular interest , which contain an ultrathin film of nonmagnetic ni ( overlayer ) artificially deposited on a relatively thick film of 3d ti ( substrate ) . due to a specific relation between electron affinities and band gap widths of the substrate and overlayer materials , significant modifications of the spectrum and wave function of the dirac states",
    "are expected as compared to the pristine 3d ti surface ( i.e. the 3d ti / vacuum interface ) , thus making it possible to obtain the 3d ti - based heterostructure with tailor - made electron properties .",
    "one assumes that the substrate film thickness is large enough to avoid sizable hybridization of the bound states appearing at the opposite boundaries of the film . at the same time , the minimal thickness of the overlayer is formally limited by the condition of an electron motion quantization in the 3d ni material . under these restrictions , to describe analytically the electron bound states near the surface of the truncated 3d ti covered by the 3d ni overlayer , the continual approach involving the method of effective surface potential ( sp ) was offered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in",
    "what follows , we will use the term near - surface state ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) for identification of the in - gap electron state localized in the subsurface region and driven by the overlayer - induced sp . just recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , several preliminary results concerning the near - surface states in the 3d ti / ni heterostructures with realistic material parameters has been obtained within the numerical simulations based on density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "below , we employ the two complementary approaches  analytical and numerical  in order to elucidate thoroughly the important question how a 3d ni overlayer affects the electron properties of 3d ti / ni heterostructures .    in the framework of the analytical approach",
    ", it is instructive to re - formulate this question in terms of the boundary conditions at the ti / ni interface for the wave function of the system .",
    "it is clear that , in systems composed of two topologically distinguishable materials , the characteristics of the near - surface state depend crucially on the choice of the boundary conditions , which still remains highly disputable subject ( for example , see refs .",
    "the wave function at the ideal atomic interface between a pair of similar materials ( e.g. , 3d ti bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and 3d ni sb@xmath0te@xmath1 have the same crystal symmetry ) satisfies the ben - daniel&duke boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "while matching the wave function at the contact of two dissimilar materials ( e.g. , such as si and bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ) is complicated within the @xmath4 formalism because the envelope function ( ef ) on each side of the interface are defined using distinct orbital basis ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "however , such complication proved to be circumvented for the particular models describing different types of contacts within the effective interface potential concept  @xcite .",
    "below , in the framework of the continual approach involving the sp scheme , we formulate general boundary conditions for the long - range envelope function of the truncated 3d ti and truncated 3d ni and find the solution for the bound near - surface states .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the situation when solely the orbital degree of freedom of electrons is manipulated by external influence at the surface .",
    "we succeed in general qualitative understanding of the dependence of the energy spectrum and spatial profile of the near - surface states on an effective sp .",
    "furthermore , in order to elucidate the fine details of the near - surface state transformation induced by the overlayer , we employ the material - specific dft calculations for the 3d ti / ni heterostructures . for the conceptual reasons , within an effective sp scheme",
    ", we also discuss the near - surface states in the fictitious heterostructures of other types , in which a substrate of a 3d ni close to the quantum transition into a 3d ti phase is covered with an overlayer of either ni or ti material .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2 , we discuss the effective sp concept , propose the model for a truncated ti covered with an overlayer , and introduce the main ingredients and assumptions of the problem within the continual approach . in sec .  3 , for the case of a spin - independent surface perturbation caused by an overlayer",
    ", we thoroughly investigate how the corresponding sp modifies the electron energy spectrum and the ef spatial profile of the dirac - like near - surface state . in sec .  4",
    ", we analyze main features of the near - surface state in a situation when a 3d ni substrate close to transition into a topological phase is covered with a ultrathin overlayer of either a ni material or a ti one . to corroborate the sp formalism results , in in sec .  5",
    ", we apply the dft calculations and analyze the band structure and wave - function of the bound near - surface states for a set of heterostructures formed by a single tetradymite - type quintuple ( ql ) or septuple ( sl ) layer blocks and 3d ti substrates .",
    "finally , the main conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "apart from the aforementioned simulations of the properties of 3d tis based on the first principle calculations , various continual models have been discussed to describe relativistic fermions at the ti boundary  @xcite .",
    "there are theoretical studies of the ti properties , which are routinely based on the simple phenomenological 2d hamiltonian for helical fermions with the linear dirac - cone - like energy - momentum dispersion under an external influence  @xcite : @xmath5)+\\mathbb{u}$ ] , where @xmath6 is the unit vector normal to the surface , @xmath7 is the fermi velocity , @xmath8 is the vector composed of the pauli matrices .",
    "it is generally thought that a controllable external field , @xmath9 , can be directly applied to the 3d ti surface to manage its electron states .",
    "for instance , a spin - independent term @xmath10 could simulate the energy shift of the dirac - cone point due to an electrostatic potential caused by a nonmagnetic overlayer . in turn , a spin - dependent term @xmath11 could generate a gapped spin - polarized surface state through an exchange field proportional to the magnetization @xmath12 applied along the normal to the surface of 3d ti which is in contact with a ferromagnetic insulator  @xcite . in this manner , to take into account a perturbation arising from the external influence , the additional term @xmath9 is simply included in the 2d hamiltonian @xmath13 , without a serious analysis of the microscopic origin of both @xmath13 and @xmath9 .",
    "the vast majority of theoretical works restricts to such the description and they predict many curious effects which can be realized in the 3d ti - based structures .",
    "however , the 2d hamiltonian @xmath13 can formally be derived from a relevant 3d hamiltonian only under the free surface stipulation in the spirit of refs .  @xcite . in the framework of the consistent scheme ,",
    "the bound near - surface states for the half - infinite 3d ti are composed of the eigen - states of the corresponding bulk 3d ti hamiltonian .",
    "meanwhile , note that so far nobody has written down the full set of the orthogonal wave - functions ( including the bound and extended along @xmath6-direction states ) for the @xmath4 hamiltonian of 3d ti in the half - infinite geometry even under the free boundary conditions on the surface . strictly speaking",
    ", the bound states alone do not form the full basis set suited for correct description of the @xmath9 field effect on 3d ti .",
    "the external surface perturbation excites electron density in the bulk 3d ti region of a nanoscopic scale adjacent to the surface . both the bound and extended electron modes give rise to the response of 3d ti to this perturbation . upon placing the 3d ni on 3d ti , besides the topological bound state , the so - called ordinary bound state  @xcite can arise near the interface due to the hybridization between the ni and ti atomic orbitals through the interface .",
    "hence the near surface electron density perturbation of the 3d ti has very complicated spatial , orbital and spin configuration .",
    "the phenomenological 2d hamiltonian @xmath13 hardly could serve as a starting point for the correct analysis of the configuration - dependent response of the 3d ti .",
    "so , to correctly take into account the effect of an external perturbation on the surface / interface electron states in the 3d ti , one has to directly include the field @xmath9 into the `` true '' 3d hamiltonian of the system .",
    "a basic idea to go beyond the scope of the 2d model is the use of the well - known @xmath4 method  @xcite . to characterize the band electron states of a bulk semiconductor ,",
    "@xmath14 ( @xmath15 is a wave vector , @xmath16 is a band index ) , in the region of the brillouin zone around the point of band extrema @xmath17 , the @xmath18 method is reputed to be accurate enough . under a perturbation smooth on the atomic scale",
    ", this method makes it possible to predict evolution of the electron state wave function @xmath19 in terms of a product of a slowly varying envelope function ( ef ) @xmath20 and the bloch function of the unperturbed crystal @xmath21 at the point @xmath17 : @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the lattice periodic function .",
    "the ef concept may also be applied to the description of localized and resonant interface states in the semiconductor junctions of different types .",
    "however , a relevant choice of the boundary conditions for the function @xmath20 remains an unsettled question in this concept , in particular for the ti based structures .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite impose the so - called open boundary conditions fixing all ef components to zero at the crystal surface .",
    "this restriction formally simulates the effect of vanishing of the quasiparticle wave function on the infinitely high sp barrier .",
    "nevertheless , it should be pointed out that the zero constraint is not unique , and other options for boundary conditions have been advocated in the literature .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite the problem is formulated in terms of an energy functional whose minimization yields the so - called natural boundary conditions , intermixing the magnitudes and derivatives of different ef components .",
    "both mentioned types of the ef boundary conditions are extremely idealized and can not adequately take into consideration a sensitivity of the 3d ti electron states to the surface modifications .    in this work",
    "we propose a formalism to directly incorporate the surface perturbation effect into the 3d ti hamiltonian .",
    "we derive the appropriate ef boundary conditions through the construction of the effective semi - phenomenological sp localized at the 3d ti surface .",

    ", we introduce the interaction of electrons with an external perturbation confined at the surface , implementing the effective sp @xmath43 into the ef calculation .",

    "it is evident that the @xmath4 approach can not provide a correct description of the wave - function behavior near the surface , where large momenta are highly important . to overcome this drawback we introduce the effective sp @xmath43 , which affects the electron states of ti at the surface",
