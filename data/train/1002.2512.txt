    "thus , the memory is a function of the parameter @xmath7 that makes the fpp very attractive for investigating the mathematical phenomenology of memory .",
    "we consider in this work the main properties of the fpp , reformulate them in terms of alpha - stable densities , construct an algorithm for simulation of interarrival time , apply it to monte carlo simulation of the fpp , and find limit distributions . on the base of this approach",
    "we will introduce also the fractional generalization of the simplest branching process and find the correspondent distributions .",
    "but first of all we ll bring some physical reasons of our interest to the fpp .",
    "for the sake of clearness , let us talk about number of events @xmath8 as about coordinate of a particle performing spasmodic motion in a given direction .",
    "the particle , appeared at the origin at time @xmath9 , stays there some random time @xmath10 , then makes a jump to the position @xmath11 , stays there random time @xmath12 , then the second jump to @xmath13 and so forth .",

    "let @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath16 , then @xmath8 is the poisson process with rate @xmath17 .",
    "if the distribution of @xmath18 is not an exponential one , but @xmath19 , the process is not a poisson one , but at large scales it looks like a poisson process and could be called the asymptotically poisson process . as in the first case , the motion of the particle considered at large scales will seem to be almost regular and uniform with the `` velocity ''  @xmath20 .",
    "there are no special asymptotical properties which appear here .",
    "the situation changes when @xmath21 has a power law long tail @xmath22 and an infinite mathematical expectation @xmath23 .",
    "namely this type of traps leads to a fractional generalization of the poisson process .",
    "the physical grounds of ( [ power_law_distribution ] ) has been discussed in a number of works .",
    "the first of interpretation of ( [ power_law_distribution ] ) has been done by tunaley [ 1972 ] on the base of the following simple jump mechanism .",
    "the process goes in an insulator containing randomly distributed point ( of small size ) traps with exponentially distributed waiting times : @xmath24 .",

    "the carriers remain concentrated near the mobility edge and the charge transit exhibit non - dispersive behavior .",
    "consequently , the physical meaning of @xmath7 is that it is representative of disorder : the smaller its value the more dispersive the transport .    the fluorescence emission of single semiconductor colloidal nanocrystals such as cdse / zns core - shell quantum dots ( qds ) , exhibits unusual intermittency behavior [ shimizu et al .",

    "thermally activated ionization , electron tunnelling through fluctuating barriers and some other mechanisms were suggested as alternative ones yielding power on- and off - time distributions . an emission wavelength of qd fluorescence is simply tuned by changing the size of the nanocrystal .",

    "fluctuations in the intensity of qd fluorescence can limit such applications . from theoretical results",
