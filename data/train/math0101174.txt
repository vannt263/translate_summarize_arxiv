    "the winterbottom theory @xcite gives a phenomenological prediction for the equilibrated shapes of small ( that is disregarding gravitation ) crystal particles placed on solid substrates .",
    "the notion of equilibrium comes on two levels :    \\(i ) as far as the bulk properties are considered , both the particle and the vapor around it are assumed to represent two different _ thermodynamic phases _ of the same physical substance .",
    "\\(ii ) the total interfacial free energy of the system comprises the anisotropic _ surface tension _ between the particle and the vapor , as well as the _ boundary surface tensions _ between the particle and the substrate and , respectively , between the vapor and the substrate . the substrate could , thus , exhibit a preference towards one of the phases , and the macroscopic winterbottom equilibrium shape corresponds to the state of minimal interfacial energy at a given particle volume .",
    ".5 truecm    0.1 in we use @xmath1 to denote the inverse temperature at which the two phases ( crystal and vapor ) coexist , and the parameter @xmath2 to quantify the preference of the substrate towards one of the two pure phases . in the magnetic interpretation of the microscopic models we shall consider below @xmath2 is the boundary magnetic field . according to the suppositions ( i),(ii ) above",
    ", the two principal players to determine the equilibrium shape are the anisotropic crystal - vapor surface tension @xmath3 and the number @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are , respectively , the substrate - crystal and the substrate - vapor boundary surface tensions .",
    "indeed , if the crystal particle occupies the region @xmath7 of @xmath8 its boundary splits into two disjoint pieces @xmath9 ( figure  [ fig_energy ] ) , and , up to a constant , the total surface energy of the system can be written ( at least for piece - wise smooth shapes ) as @xmath10 the equilibrium particle shapes at a prescribed volume @xmath11 correspond , in the above notation , to the minimizers of the following variational problem : + @xmath12 + winterbottom @xcite described the geometric construction of the solutions to @xmath13 , which , in fact , is an easy consequence of the general wulff construction @xcite of the equilibrium crystal shapes : first of all the minimizers are scale invariant under dilatation . in order to construct the unnormalized winterbottom shape",
    "pick the `` free '' wulff crystal @xmath14 and intersect it with the half - space @xmath15 where we use the coordinate representation @xmath16 of a vector @xmath17 .",
    "it is convenient to parameterize the substrate surface by one of the coordinate hyperplanes , say by @xmath18 .",
    "the equilibrium winterbottom shape at volume @xmath11 is , then , given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the unit coordinate vector in the @xmath21-direction and @xmath22 is used to denote the volume of the unnormalized winterbottom shape .",
    "as we shall explain in subsection  [ subsection_wallfree energy ] , the value of the difference @xmath23 always lies in the interval @xmath24 $ ] . ] .",
    "thus , one of the following three cases happens :    1 .",
    "_ complete drying : _",
    "@xmath25 . in this case",
    "@xmath26 , which means that the winterbottom droplet has no energetic reasons to be near the substrate surface and can be located anywhere above it .",
    "_ partial drying / wetting : _ in this regime @xmath27 .",
    "accordingly , the convex body @xmath28 is obtained by removing a proper cap from @xmath29 ( figure [ fig_energy ] ) .",
    "we shall , furthermore , distinguish between the partial drying , @xmath30 , and the partial wetting , @xmath31 , cases .",
    "3 .   _ complete wetting : _",
    "@xmath32 . in this case , @xmath28 has volume zero and , therefore , can not be rescaled to get a volume @xmath11 .",
    "physically this corresponds to the formation of a microscopic film along the substrate , preventing the vapor phase to reach it .",
    "our main objective here is to give a rigorous derivation of the phenomenological winterbottom picture in the scaling limit of microscopic models of lattice gases , that is directly from the basic principles of the equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the class of microscopic models we consider are ferromagnetic ising type models with finite range of interactions . in the subsequent subsections",
    "we shall briefly recall these models as well as the thermodynamic procedures leading to the notion of _ bulk phases _ and various _ surface tensions _ which appear in the functional .",
    "the results fall in the framework of the @xmath33-theory of phase segregation , which has been initiated in the works @xcite on the nearest neighbor ising model and in the works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite on the kac ising models .",
    "recent developments of the theory have been prompted by the work @xcite and comprise a rigorous derivation of the ( free ) multi - dimensional wulff crystal shapes in the context of bernoulli bond percolation @xcite and in the context of nearest neighbor ising model in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "most recently the theory has been generalized to the case of symmetric @xmath34-states potts models @xcite .",
    "we refer to the review article @xcite for a detailed account of the @xmath35-theory and its relation to the dobrushin - koteck - shlosman approach",
    "( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) to the problems of phase segregation",
    ".      the derivation of the macroscopic geometry of an equilibrium droplet in contact with a substrate has been accomplished in several models , which can be divided into two classes .",
    "the first class is that of sos - type models , with a positivity constraint , a fixed volume under field , and an attraction to the wall .",
    "the first such study was done for the @xmath36-dimensional model in  @xcite ( see also @xcite for an alternative approach ) , while its higher dimensional counterpart was treated in  @xcite ; see also  @xcite for an analysis of the effect of substrate roughness in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "other related works , which neglect the interaction between the substrate and the interface ( therefore describing a completely neutral substrate ) , are  @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite ; notice however that these works cover only one special point of the full regime of complete wetting .",
    "this class of models provide a somehow appealing description of this phenomenon , but has several shortcomings .",
    "the first one is that the full phenomenology of the wetting transition can not be observed , due to the very particular constraint that the droplet has to be the graph of a function ( e.g. it is of course impossible for the droplet to detach from the wall ) .",
    "the corresponding variational problem also displays some non - physical properties , e.g. the minimizer are in general not scale invariant . and of course , these sos models are effective models for interfaces , not truly microscopic ones , so they do not clarify the mechanism which generates the interface itself . on the other hand , due to these simplifying features , it is possible to obtain some additional information about fluctuations around the equilibrium shape , see  @xcite , which go beyond what we can achieve for the models considered in the present work .",
    "for an in - depth review and references on these effective models , we refer the reader to the survey  @xcite .",
    "the second class contains more realistic lattice gas models of the type we consider here .",
    "only the two - dimensional nearest - neighbor ising model had been studied before  @xcite , but the description provided is rather complete .",
    "the wetting transition can be fully described , and the characterization of typical configurations is very accurate , especially when these results are combined with the local limit estimates of  @xcite : there is a unique macroscopic droplet whose boundary is close in hausdorff distance to one of the solutions of the winterbottom variational problem , and all the other droplets are of size at most @xmath37 , @xmath38 being the linear size of the box .",
    "notice that at low temperature , it is also possible to obtain precise informations on the fluctuations around the minimizer , see  @xcite .",
    "we start by introducing the measures describing finite - range ferromagnetic ising models with pair interactions in the bulk ; the complete description , including the influence of the substrate , is given in subsection  [ subsection_wallfree energy ] .",

    "the fact that the proof swiftly goes through in the general case we consider here is a dividend of such an approach .    the deep model oriented fact is the validity of pisztora s coarse graining  @xcite and its application to the relaxation properties of the fk measures  @xcite ;",
    "both have been originally developed in the nearest neighbor context , but go through literally without changes in any model with translation invariant finite - range ferromagnetic pair interactions . in section  [ section_fk ]",
    "we briefly recall the corresponding construction and show how to adjust it to treat the boundary surface tension . in section  [ section_renormalization ]",
    "we set up the machinery of random mesoscopic phase labels and relate it to the context of the theory of functions of bounded variation . since the boundary field introduces a singularity of the surface tension at the bottom wall , some additional care ( as compared to @xcite ) is needed at this stage .",
    "furthermore , the appropriate fk - representation in the case of negative boundary magnetic fields happens to be a conditional one .",
    "in particular , the compactness estimates have to be modified .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ theorem_b ] ( and , on the way , theorem  [ theorem_a ] ) is relegated to section  [ section_proof ] . in view of the results and adjustments of the preceding sections it closely follows the pattern laid down in @xcite .",
    "accordingly , our exposition in this section will be rather concise with repeated references to the appropriate parts of @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that though the minimizers of the variational problem @xmath187 restricted to the sets @xmath188 are , in general , not known for @xmath189 , the @xmath190-approach still could be pushed through to yield meaningful results in the sense that one can prove that the mesoscopic configurations concentrate around a ( in general unknown ) set of surface energy minimizers .",
    "such an idea of decoupling between the probabilistic analysis of the microscopic model and the investigation of the limiting variational problem has been put forward in @xcite and , recently , systematically exploited in @xcite .",
    "indeed , the microscopic derivation of phase coexistence is based upon local decoupling estimates and on surgical procedures in small regions localized along the interface of the crystals .",
    "therefore , from the probabilist point of view the approach is local and does not rely on the global shape of the solutions to the corresponding variational problems . on the technical level , however , one should adjust the approximation results of subsection  [ subsection approximation result i ] to the case of unknown minimizers .",
    "the approximation procedure we use here hinges on the fact that the minimizers are known to be convex .",
    "if the surface tension is singular at the boundary ( that is in the partial wetting / drying cases ) , a complete geometric analysis without such an information would require a serious detour into the geometric measure theory which , from our point of view , would not bring any deeper insights on the microscopic phenomena involved in the winterbottom construction .",
    "we refer to @xcite or to @xcite for a detailed exposition of the appropriate facts from the theory of functions of bounded variation .",
    "a more challenging problem is to gain a better understanding of the statistical properties of phase boundaries , even on mesoscopic or macroscopic scales .",
    "for example , the only information the @xmath191-approach yields on the entropically repulsed interface is a localization on the macroscopic scale , which is , of course , not such a fantastic result , since we absolutely do not control the typical microscopic size of the corresponding fluctuations .",
    "fk representation is an artificial coupling between the ferromagnetic spin models and the , so called , random cluster measures .",
    "its power rests with the fact that the latter are in the _ uniqueness _ regime and possess uniform decoupling and relaxation properties , even when the original spin system is in the phase coexistence region . ] .",
    "the art of the fk representation is , therefore , to single out such spin configuration properties which admit a reformulation in the fk language .      with a given finite range translation invariant pair interaction potential @xmath192 we associate the graph @xmath193 where the edge set @xmath194 consists of all ( unoriented ) pairs of vertices @xmath44 with @xmath195 .",

    "we define next the fk measures which correspond to the finite volume spin gibbs states on the boxes @xmath209 : first of all these measures put non - trivial weights on the percolation configurations @xmath210 , where the set @xmath211 comprises those of the bonds @xmath212 which intersect @xmath209 .",

    "thus , the extremal ones correspond to the free ( @xmath222 ) and wired ( @xmath223 ) boundary conditions and are denoted as @xmath224 and @xmath225 respectively .",
    "the corresponding infinite volume ( @xmath133 ) limits @xmath226 and @xmath227 always exist , and it takes a relatively soft argument @xcite to show that for all but at most a countable set of temperatures @xmath228 there is a unique infinite volume fk - measure : + * ( a1 ) * we assume that the inverse temperature @xmath1 satisfies @xmath229 .",

    "the surface tension of the spin model can be expressed in the fk language in the following way : let us split the boundary @xmath240 into two pieces : @xmath241 then the ratio of partition functions in is equal to @xmath242 where the fk - percolation event @xmath243 means that no site of @xmath91 is connected both to @xmath244 and to @xmath245 . + the expression   for the surface tension is not very convenient in practice .",
    "indeed , in higher dimensions one should not expect the interface to decouple along pure wired b.c",
    ". it would therefore be very useful to have a more robust definition which would still fit in the framework of the @xmath35-theory .",
    "the idea is twofold .",
    "first , one can relax the pinning of the `` microscopic interface '' along the lateral sides of @xmath91 , by requesting only that the top and bottom faces of the box are disconnected . of course in order to still recover the surface tension in the direction orthogonal to @xmath84 ,",
    "one has to choose @xmath246 .",
    "the control of the interactions on the lateral sides is one of the major technical contribution initiated by cerf in @xcite .",
    "the second point is to relax boundary conditions , i.e. to replace the wired b.c .",
    "by some arbitrary @xmath218 .",
