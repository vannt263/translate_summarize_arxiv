    "the expected value of time until the hunter catches the rabbit is equal to the expected time until the recipient receives the mail .",
    "one of our goals is to improve these procedures .",
    "we introduce some games resembling the hunter vs. rabbit game .",
    "the first one is the princess vs. monster game . in this game , the monster tries to catch the princess in area @xmath13 .",

    "meggido showed that the computation time of the search number of a graph is np - hard@xcite . if an edge can be cleared without moving along it , but it suffices to look into an edge from a vertex , then the minimum number of guards needed to catch the fugitive is called the node search number of graph @xcite .",
