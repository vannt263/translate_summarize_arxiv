    "the casimir effect @xcite , inspiring many branches of physics @xcite , features a decisive geometry dependence : the fluctuation - induced interaction between test bodies or surfaces depends on their shape and orientation .",
    "this is because the casimir effect arises from the fluctuation spectrum in presence of the surfaces relative to the vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the spectral properties in turn are a direct consequence of the geometry .",
    "this geometry dependence becomes even more pronounced at finite temperature @xmath0 : thermal fluctuations can predominantly be associated with a characteristic length scale , the thermal wavelength @xmath1 .",
    "thermal fluctuations contribute to the casimir force , whenever the scale set by the thermal wavelength is commensurate with a mode of the fluctuation spectrum as defined by the geometry .",
    "therefore , thermal corrections to the zero - temperature casimir effect generally can not be described by universal additive terms or other simple recipes but require a careful analysis of the interplay between geometry and temperature , as first anticipated in @xcite .",
    "this `` geothermal '' interplay has first been verified in paradigmatic perpendicular - plates @xcite or general inclined - plates configurations @xcite .",
    "further evidence for the experimentally relevant sphere - plate configuration has been provided recently in @xcite .",
    "typical low - temperature dependencies in these open geometries obey power laws with characteristic exponents that are particular for the geometry .",
    "most importantly , these power laws disagree with predictions from standard local approximation techniques such as the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) @xcite  even in the limit of vanishing surface separation .",
    "this is in contrast to zero - temperature forces which are often well described by the pfa in this limit @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we perform a comprehensive study of the geometry - temperature interplay for the sphere - plate and cylinder - plate configuration .",
    "we study the casimir forces induced by fluctuations of a scalar field obeying dirichlet boundary conditions on the surfaces in order to explore the geothermal interplay in a most transparent fashion .",
    "moreover , we use the worldline approach to the casimir effect @xcite which on the one hand provides for a highly intuitive picture of the fluctuations , and on the other hand facilitates analytical as well as numerical computations from first principles @xcite .",
    "for instance , the failure of local or additive approximation techniques can directly be inferred from the temperature dependence of the force density : the latter tends to delocalize for decreasing temperatures on scales of the thermal wavelength @xcite .",
    "local approximation techniques may only be useful at finite temperature if the strict weak - coupling limit is taken @xcite , or in the high - temperature limit .    in the present work ,",
    "we analyze the thermal force density distributions , compute thermal forces for a wide nonperturbative range of parameters , and determine asymptotic limits .",
    "this facilitates a careful comparison with local approximation techniques , and , most importantly , yields new and unexpected results for the geometry dependence of thermal forces . for instance , the pure thermal force , i.e. , the thermal contribution to the casimir force , reveals a non - monotonic behavior below a critical temperature for the sphere - plate and cylinder - plate case @xcite : the attractive thermal force can increase for increasing distances .",
    "this anomalous feature is triggered by a reweighting of relevant fluctuations on the scale of the thermal wavelength  a phenomenon which becomes transparent within the worldline picture of the casimir effect .",
    "whereas these non - monotonic features already occur for a simple dirichlet scalar model , non - monotonicities can also arise from a competition between te and tm modes of electromagnetic fluctuations in configurations with side walls @xcite .    while there are a number of impressive verifications of the zero - temperature casimir force @xcite , a comparison between theory and thermal force measurements suffers from the interplay between dielectric material properties and finite temperature @xcite , still being a subject of intense theoretical investigations @xcite . in view of the geothermal interplay",
    ", we expect that the full resolution of this issue requires the comprehensive treatment of geometry , temperature and material properties , possibly also including edge effects @xcite .",
    "first results on the sphere - plate configuration using scattering theory and specific dielectric models demonstrate this nontrivial interplay @xcite",
    ".    as a crucial ingredient for such an analysis , field - theoretical methods for casimir phenomena have to be used that can deal with arbitrary casimir geometries .",
    "in addition to the worldline methods @xcite used in this work , a variety of approaches has been developed in recent years , such as a functional integral approach @xcite and scattering theory @xcite .",
    "an extension of these methods to finite temperature is usually straightforward and highly worthwhile in view of the geometry - temperature interplay .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : after a brief account of the worldline approach to the casimir effect in sect .  [",
    "sec : worldl - appr - casim ] , the sphere - plate and cylinder - plate configurations are studied at zero temperature in sect .",
    "[ sec : case - t=0 ] .",

    "our conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] . for reasons of comparison ,",
    "the proximity - force approximation for the sphere - plate and cylinder - plate case is worked out in detail in appendix [ app : pfa ] .",
    "in addition to explicit formulas which have not comprehensively appeared in the literature so far , we relate the pfa to an approximate treatment of the worldline path integral which helps to understand the differences between the exact and approximate treatments .",

    ", we make contact with earlier results for the casimir effect of a cylinder and sphere above a plate @xcite .",
    "moreover , we generalize the worldline method to directly compute the casimir force instead of the energy which leads again to significant simplifications compared to previous energy calculations",

    "furthermore in the process of taking the @xmath64 integral from zero to infinity , the opening angle of the cone shrinks .",

    "these simplification facilitate to extend the previously studied parameter range to even larger @xmath70 ratios with higher statistics .      in many respects ,",
    "the cylinder - plate configuration is `` in between '' the sphere - plate configuration and the classic parallel - plates case .",

    "only those points of a worldline lying on the rays intersecting the cylinder pass through the latter for some values of @xmath55 .",
    "the construction of the support of the @xmath15 integral is identical to that for the sphere - plate case , such that the total casimir force on the cylinder can be written as in eq .",

    "the latter is used by default for the data analysis of geometry corrections in most experiments .",

    "the pfa is inherently ambiguous as the measure for this final integration is not unique : possible alternatives are the surface measures of one of the involved surfaces or any intermediate auxiliary surface .",
    "later on , we will refer to the `` sphere - based '' or `` plate - based '' pfa as two generic options for the integration measure .",
    "the pfa for the present configuration is discussed in detail in appendix [ app : pfa ] .",
    "the concept of the pfa can also be translated into the worldline picture : as an approximation to the ensemble of complicated multidimensional worldlines , we may reduce the worldlines to one dimensional straight lines .",
    "the length of a line then corresponds to the average extent of a worldline into a certain relevant direction in a given geometry .",
    "this picture also explains the occurrence of deviations from the pfa as well as the sign of these deviations in the dirichlet case : due to the spatial extent of the worldlines , they generically intersect both boundaries for smaller values of @xmath15 than simple straight lines .",
    "as small propertimes yield quantitatively larger contributions , this property then results in a greater force .",
    "more precisely , the size squared of a worldline is proportional to the propertime parameter which is in the denominator of the worldline formula , see eq .  .",
    "this explains why worldline results are typically underestimated by the pfa for small separations of the objects .",
    "for very small separations , the upper bound of the propertime integration can effectively be set to infinity , whereas the lower bound is a measure for the first ( proper-)time , when a worldline intersects both objects .",

    "the systematic study of the pfa , also from the worldline point of view , is summarized in appendix [ app : pfa ] .",
    "we observe that the normalized force obtained with worldline numerics does not lie inside the range spanned by the ambiguity of the pfa estimates .",
    "most prominently , the sign of the deviations from the @xmath89 limit is different in the dirichlet scalar case , as can be understood in the worldline picture described above .",

    "the number of points per loop used was @xmath94 . for larger distances",
    "the number of points per loop has to be increased far beyond @xmath95 , since , as shown in fig .",

    "even such high resolution is not sufficient to resolve the small sphere for larger distances .    already anticipating our results for finite temperature",

    "below , we observe that for @xmath96 the maximum of the thermal contribution to the force density at low temperatures @xmath97 lies outside the sphere on scales @xmath98 . from the fact that ensembles with @xmath99 are reliable for those cases where the dominant contribution to the force density lies within @xmath100",
    ", we conclude that temperatures above @xmath101 are accessible also in the limit @xmath102 .    from an algorithmic point of view",
    ", the sphere - plate and cylinder - plate configurations differ with respect to computational efficiency also beyond the trivial dimensional factors : for a sphere at large separations , a large fraction of points of a worldline can be dropped right from the beginning , as they never see the sphere , i.e , they never lie on a ray inside the cone .",
    "the situation is different for a cylinder .",
    "dealing with a two dimensional problem , we use two dimensional worldlines and the number of points per worldline which now have to lie in a wedge is higher than those lying in a cone for the sphere - plate case . using comparable worldlines with a large number of points per loop , we thus expect the worldline numerics to break down at far larger distances @xmath29 than in the case of a sphere .",

    "even at such large separations as @xmath88 , we observe an excellent agreement with @xcite .",
    "the corresponding estimate for the validity limits at small temperatures then is @xmath107 .",

    "most importantly , the complicated geometry - dependent part of the calculation remains the same for zero or finite temperature .",
    "let us first perform a general analysis of the thermal correction for a generic casimir configuration following an argument given in @xcite .",

    "consequently , an extreme simplification arises : the low - temperature limit of the thermal correction can be obtained by first taking the formal limit @xmath124 .",
    "this was first observed in @xcite and then successfully applied in @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we argue that there is no divergence in the local thermal force density in the limit @xmath89 for general geometries . for a generic geometry ,",
    "the @xmath29-divergent part can only arise from the regions of contact as @xmath119 .",
    "the divergence for these regions at @xmath116 is due to the diverging propertime integral over @xmath125 which is bounded from below by @xmath126 .",
    "this is because for worldlines smaller than @xmath29 the worldline functional is always zero . at finite temperature",
    "the divergence in the thermal correction for @xmath119 is removed since one integrates now over @xmath127 , which is zero for every @xmath128 in the limit @xmath129 .",

    "this procedure corresponds to substituting the critical regions of contact by broader ( and infinitely extended ) parallel plates , see @xcite .",

    "we observe a potentially accidental agreement with the pfa prediction for larger temperatures . here , the errors introduced by the pfa for the aspect of geometry appear to cancel , whereas the thermal aspects might be included sufficiently accurately .",

    "this phenomenon is not related to a competition of polarization modes as in @xcite , but exists already for the dirichlet scalar case .",
    "the phenomenon can be understood within the worldline picture of the casimir effect @xcite being triggered by a reweighting of relevant fluctuations on the scale of the thermal wavelength . from this picture , it is clear that the phenomenon is not restricted to spheres or cylinders above a plate ; we expect it to occur for general compact or semi - compact objects in front of surfaces , as long as the lateral surface extension is significantly larger than the thermal wavelength .",

    "the two extreme cases in which @xmath2 coincides with one of the two bodies provides us with a region spanning the inherently ambiguous estimates of the pfa .    for a sphere at a distance @xmath29 above a plate ,",

    "since the factor approaches @xmath8 for small @xmath64 , all functions @xmath356 coincide in this limit .",
    "the pfa can also be developed within worldline formalism . calculating the casimir force density for two parallel plates",
    ", we have to determine that value of propertimes @xmath55 for which one dimensional worldlines , attached to one of the plates , touch the other plate for the first time .",
    "this event is encoded in the lower bound of the proper time integral , whereas the upper bound is set to infinity .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath379 the representation ( [ a - pfa-4 ] ) is suitable for zero and low temperatures , whereas for high temperatures one should use in ( [ a - pfa-4 ] ) the poisson resummed winding sum ( [ ft - sap-6 ] ) .",
    "we encounter cumulants of worldline extents @xmath380 in low and high temperature limits which can be determined via the analytic expression @xcite @xmath381 let us now point out the difference between the pfa and the worldline approach . in the pfa , we always use one dimensional worldlines to determine the distance , whereas the worldline dimension in the full formalism corresponds to the dimension of the geometry . to obtain the casimir force for configurations containing one infinite plate in the worldline formalism , we integrate over this infinite plate as in the plate - based approach .",
    "however , the integration does not stop at the end of the second body , which in the present case is a sphere or cylinder . at arbitrary large distances , there are still worldlines which see the sphere / cylinder , i.e. , we have to integrate to infinity .",
    "we therefore expect the leading - order pfa to reflect best the exact force laws .",
    "however , the propertime support is not the same , and thus worldlines see an effective height different from the one of the leading - order pfa , see fig .",
    "[ a - f1 ] and [ a - f2 ] .",
    "the shape of the effective worldline height is roughly the same for zero and high temperatures .",
    "but at low temperature , the worldlines are reweighted .",
    "only worldlines for large propertimes contribute considerably and thus worldlines at larger distances from the sphere become increasingly more important .",
    "also their inner structure comes into play . using the plate based pfa",
