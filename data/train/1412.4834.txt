    "despite the fortunate configuration of detached eclipsing binaries ( debs ) and many possibilities that it gives us , analysis of these objects still encounters some difficulties .",
    "the light curves themselves do not contain enough information about the effective temperatures in the absolute scale , mainly about their ratio .",
    "it is sometimes being set on the basis of the colour of the whole system , so combined light of two , sometimes very different stars .",
    "another problem occurs when it comes to calculate the fractional radii ( defined as a fraction of the major semi - axis ) .",
    "the information about their sum comes mainly from the width of eclipses , and is somewhat degenerated with the inclination angle , but from the light curves only it is difficult to constrain their ratio .",
    "again , other kinds of data are needed , like spectra , from which one can try to estimate the ratio of fluxes coming from the two components .",
    "both that issues are however much less important in even more fortunate case , when a system shows total eclipses , when light from only one component is seen .",
    "the presence of a flat minimum in the light curves already solves the mentioned problems and other kind of observation help to improve the analysis even more .",
    "such a fortunate situation occurs either when the inclination angle is very close to 90 degrees , or when the two stars have significantly different sizes .",
    "the latter usually means that at least one component is evolved . because of a long - lasting evolution on the main sequence ( ms ) , such evolved systems are much less common than the ms eclipsing binaries . in the recent ,",
    "very fine summary @xcite point out the lack of red giant systems with accurately measured properties , especially masses and radii .",
    "@xcite list only 4 red giants in their sample : ai  phe  a , tz  for  a , and both components of ogle-051019.64 - 685812.3 in the lmc .",
    "since then a small number of systems have been added to the sample , but either containing one giant component ( kic  8410637 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or located the magellanic clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. no galactic double - giant system has been accurately studied .",
    "some interesting cases were analysed @xcite but due to various reasons their parameters are not yet determined precisely enough .",
    "long baseline interferometry was successful in measuring the radii of single red giants directly , but without mass determination .",
    "asteroseismology of solar - type oscillations is another option , and with long - cadence , continuous and precise light curves from _ corot _ and _ kepler _ satellites it appears to be a promising method @xcite , especially if combined with interferometric radius measurements @xcite , but still the precision achieved is lower than for double - lined debs , or the differences between parameters obtained from asteroseismology and other methods is significant .    in this paper",

    "stars of a similar mass present a wide range of radii , temperatures , luminosities etc .",
    ", so precise mass and metallicity determination is crucial to constrain their age and exact evolutionary phase .",
    "we compared our results from table [ par_fi ] with stellar isochrones from the padova and trieste stellar evolution code ( parsec ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we used the value of @xmath28=-0.25 $ ] , which for this set translates into @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "we looked for the age that fits best to our precise and direct mass measurements , and found that asas-19 is @xmath37  gyr old .",
    "most of this age uncertainty comes from the [ @xmath38 determination  for a fixed metal content , the uncertainty coming from the mass determination is only 0.01  gyr .    in the figure [ fig_iso ]",
    "we show our results on mass vs. temperature , luminosity and radius diagrams , together with various isochrones : the best - fitting ( 2.38  gyr , @xmath39  dex ) , two for the marginal values of age and metallicity that still reproduce our results within 1@xmath22  2.24  gyr for @xmath40 , and 2.55  gyr for @xmath41 dex ( left , also in figure  [ fig_hr ] ) , and two more for fixed metallicity of @xmath39  dex but the age of 2.37 and 2.39 gyr ( right ) .",
    "one can note , that the 2.38  gyr , @xmath39  dex isochrone that fits the mass measurements best , predicts slightly hotter and more luminous stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig_hr ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy may come from either metallicity or temperatures being a bit underestimated .",
    "the 2.38  gyr , @xmath39  dex isochrone fits better if temperatures from the calibrations of @xcite are used .",
    "the cases like asas-19 allow for independent verification of indirect approaches to determine physical parameters of stars in eclipsing binaries .",
    "it shows how the observations performed during a total eclipse are useful for the analysis of debs .",
    "especially important was the spectrum taken when only one star was visible . from its analysis",
    "we could independently estimate the temperature of one of the components and metallicity of the whole system .",
    "light curves alone do not constrain well the temperature scale , only the ratio of the two @xmath20-s . the common approach to light curve modelling utilizes the observed colour of the whole system , but it works fine only if the components have similar temperature or the total light is dominated by one of them , and only if the observed colour is properly dereddened . in our case we could securely keep one of the @xmath20-s fixed",
    ". we could also calculate the observed colours of both stars , one directly from the photometry in the total eclipse , and the other from simple calculations described in section [ sec_jkt_h ] .",
    "having the multi - band photometry and the @xmath20 estimation from the spectrum , one can also calculate the @xmath21 by comparing the colours observed and predicted by colour - temperature calibrations . for nearby systems , where the interstellar extinction is not significant",
    ", the observed colours would be enough to calculate the temperature of both components .",
    "we have also used the totality spectrum to estimate the metallicity of the system .",
    "this helped us to constrain the age of the binary .",
    "the well known age - metallicity degeneration is weaker for red giants than for main sequence stars , but is still present .",
    "as we ve found in section [ sec_age ] , 0.1 dex uncertainty in [ @xmath38 translates into 0.1 gyr error in age . for",
    "main sequence objects it is at least 10 times more , but it would still be enough to discriminate between stars that have just started their ms evolution , and those that are about to finish it soon .",
    "metallicity can also be estimated from tomographically disentangled spectra , but the disentangled spectra have to be correctly renormalized in order to account for the companion s continuum which dilutes the depth of the absorption lines .",
    "it is relatively easy for systems showing total eclipses , as from the depth of this eclipse it is straightforward to calculate the contribution of each component , and it also allows us to check if the flux ratio inferred from todcor is correct .",
    "it is also possible to verify the results of decomposition by comparing the decomposed and totality spectra , as in figure [ fig_tomo ] .",
    "as one can see , the disentangled spectra are of higher s / n , however , the approach we used ( h - group ) requires at least 8 observations in evenly - spread orbital phases . for totally - eclipsing systems , having a single observation during the total eclipse",
    "is less time - consuming and can give important results with less effort .",
    "we also want to note , that the decomposition itself is easier , as for each observed composite spectrum it is required to know only two parameters : the velocity difference for the component visible in totality and the flux ratio , both of which can be estimated separately or are easy to fit for .",
    "finally we want to emphasize that a high signal - to - noise spectrum taken during totality can also be a very good template for rv measurements of at least one component , as it obviously matches its @xmath20 , @xmath42 , [ @xmath38 and turbulence velocities .",
