    "in the abstract of his seminal paper @xcite , v. jones wrote : `` by studying representations of the braid group satisfying a certain quadratic relation we obtain a polynomial invariant in two variables for oriented links . ",

    "this two variable link polynomial @xmath2 , commonly referred to as the homfly polynomial for an oriented link @xmath3 in @xmath0 , is characterized by the following crossing changing formula : @xmath4    since then , this two variable link polynomial has been generalized to the quantum invariant associated with irreducible representations of the quantum group @xmath5 , with the variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we will refer to this generalization as the colored homfly polynomial .    despite the fact that the theory of quantum invariants of links is by now well developed",
    ", the computation of colored homfly polynomial is still extremely challenging . besides the trivial links , a general formula seems to exist in the mathematics literature only for the hopf link @xcite . in the physics literature , witten s chern - simons path integral with the gauge group",
    "@xmath8 @xcite offers an intrinsic but not rigorous definition of the colored homfly polynomial .",

    "motivated by this conjectured relationship , labastida , mario and vafa proposed a precise conjecture about the structure of their reformulation of the colored homfly polynomial @xcite@xcite .",

    "in this paper , using an approach to calculate quantum invariants of links via cabling - projection rule , we derive a formula for the colored homfly polynomial in terms of the characters of the hecke algebras and schur polynomials .",
    "see theorem 4.3 .",
    "an important feature of this formula is that the character of the hecke algebra is free of the variable @xmath10 and the schur polynomial is independent of the link @xmath3 .",
    "we think that this separation of the variable @xmath10 and the link @xmath3 might be important for a possible proof of the labastida - mario - vafa conjecture .",
    "our technique leads to a fairly simple formula for the colored homfly polynomial of torus links .",
