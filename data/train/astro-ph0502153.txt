    "the intrinsic , three - dimensional ( hereafter 3-d ) shape of clusters of galaxies is an important cosmological probe .",
    "the structure of galaxy clusters is sensitive to the mass density in the universe , so knowledge of this structure can help in discriminating between different cosmological models . it has long been clear that the formation epoch of galaxy clusters strongly depends on the matter density parameter of the universe @xcite .",
    "the growth of structure in a high - matter - density universe is expected to continue to the present day , whereas in a low density universe the fraction of recently formed clusters , which are more likely to have substructure , is lower .",
    "therefore , a sub - critical value of the density parameter @xmath1 favors clusters with steeper density profiles and rounder isodensity contours .",
    "less dramatically , a cosmological constant also delays the formation epoch of clusters , favoring the presence of structural irregularity  @xcite .",
    "+ an accurate knowledge of intrinsic cluster shape is also required to constrain structure formation models via observations of clusters .",
    "the asphericity of dark halos affects the inferred central mass density of clusters , the predicted frequency of gravitational arcs , nonlinear clustering ( especially high - order clustering statistics ) and dynamics of galactic satellites ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "+ asphericity in the gas density distribution of clusters of galaxies is crucial in modeling x - ray morphologies and in using clusters as cosmological tools .",
    "@xcite . assumed cluster shape strongly affects absolute distances obtained from x - ray / sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) measurements , as well as relative distances obtained from baryon fraction constraints  @xcite .",
    "finally , all cluster mass measurements derived from x - ray and dynamical observations are sensitive to the assumptions about cluster symmetry .",
    "+ of course , only the two - dimensional ( 2-d ) projected properties of clusters can be observed .",
    "the question of how to deproject observed images is a well - posed inversion problem that has been studied by many authors  @xcite . since information is lost in the process of projection it is in general impossible to derive the intrinsic 3-d shape of an astronomical object from a single observation . to some extent , however",
    ", one can overcome this degeneracy by combining observations in different wavelengths .",
    "for example , @xcite introduced a model - independent method of image deprojection .",
    "this inversion method uses x - ray , radio and weak lensing maps to infer the underlying 3-d structure for an axially symmetric distribution .",
    "@xcite proposed a parameter - free algorithm for the deprojection of observed two dimensional cluster images , again using weak lensing , x - ray surface brightness and sz imaging .",
    "the 3-d gravitational potential was assumed to be axially symmetric and the inclination angle was required as an input parameter .",
    "strategies for determining the orientation have been also discussed .",
    "@xcite proposed a method that , with a perturbative approach and with the aid of sz and weak lensing data , could predict the cluster x - ray emissivity without resolving the full 3-d structure of the cluster .",
    "the degeneracy between the distance to galaxy clusters and the elongation of the cluster along the line of sight ( l.o.s . )",
    "was thoroughly discussed by  @xcite .",
    "they introduced a specific method for finding the intrinsic 3-d shape of triaxial cluster and , at the same time , measuring the distance to the cluster corrected for asphericity , so providing an unbiased estimate of the hubble constant @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite recently proposed a theoretical method to reconstruct the shape of triaxial dark matter halos using x - ray and sz data .",
    "the hubble constant and the projection angle of one principal axis of the cluster on the plane of the sky being independently known , they constructed a numerical algorithm to determine the halo eccentricities and orientation .",
    "however , neither  @xcite nor  @xcite apply their method to real data .",
    "+ in this paper we focus on x - ray surface brightness observations and sz temperature decrement measurements .",
    "we show how the intrinsic 3-d shape of a cluster of galaxies can be determined through joint analyses of these data , given an assumed cosmology .",
    "we constrain the triaxial structure of a sample of observed clusters of galaxies with measured x - ray and sz maps .",
    "to break the degeneracy between shape and cosmology , we adopt cosmological parameters which have been relatively well - determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy , type ia supernovae and the spatial distribution of galaxies .",
    "we also show how , if multiply - imaging gravitational lens systems are observed , a joint analysis of strong lensing , x - rays and sz data allows a determination of both the 3-d shape of a cluster and the geometrical properties of the universe .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic dependencies of cluster x - ray emission and the sze on geometry are reviewed in ",
    "[ sec : multi_wave ] . in ",
    "[ sec : combin_datasets ] , we show how to reconstruct the 3-d cluster structure from these data , presuming cosmological parameters to be known . in passing we note how the addition of suitable strong gravitational lensing data can constrain the cosmological parameters as well , although we do not impose lensing constraints in this paper .",
    "we then turn to face the data .",
    "our cluster sample is introduced in   [ sec : data_samp ] , and in   [",
    "sec : morph_2d ] , we present 2-d x - ray surface brightness parameters for each sample member . the triaxial structure of the clusters is then estimated and analyzed in   [",

    "[ sec : lensing ] the identifications of multiple sets of images of background galaxies in strong lensing events is discussed . throughout this paper , unless otherwise stated , we quote errors at the @xmath4 confidence level .",
    "in this section , we summarize the relationships between sz and x - ray observables , on the one hand , and cluster shape and distance on the other .      the gravitational potential wells of galaxy clusters contain plasma at temperatures of about @xmath5-@xmath6 .",
    "cmb photons that pass through a cluster interact with the energetic electrons of its hot intra - cluster medium ( icm ) through inverse compton scattering , with a probability @xmath7 .",
    "this interaction causes a small distortion in the cmb spectrum , known as the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze )  @xcite , which is proportional to the electron pressure integrated along the l.o.s .",

    "the measured temperature decrement @xmath8 of the cmb is given by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the temperature of the icm , @xmath11 the boltzmann constant , @xmath12k is the temperature of the cmb , @xmath13 the thompson cross section , @xmath14 the electron mass , @xmath15 the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath16 accounts for frequency shift and relativistic corrections .",

    "a more general expression of the angular diameter distance , also accounting for dark energy and inhomogeneity in matter distribution , can be found in  @xcite .",
    "cluster x - ray emission is due to bremsstrahlung and line radiation resulting from electron - ion collisions ; the x - ray surface brightness @xmath42 is proportional to the integral along the l.o.s . of the square of the electron density : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the x - ray cooling function of the icm in the cluster rest frame .",
    "substituting eq .",

    "here we discuss how 2-d sze and x - ray maps of a cluster can be used to constrain its 3-d shape . we follow a parametric approach .",
    "we model the cluster using an isothermal , triaxial @xmath3 profile , and adopt a concordance model for the cosmological distance - redshift relationships .",
    "details of the cluster model are given in appendix  [ sec : triaxial ] .",
    "+ this model has long been used to describe the electron distributions of galaxy clusters .",
    "it was originally introduced specifically for dynamically relaxed , isothermal clusters  @xcite , but it was then observed to fit the x - ray emission of most galaxy clusters reasonably well",
    ". a serious drawback of this model is that electron density profiles with extreme axial ratios lead either to unlikely total mass density distributions , i.e. dumbbell shaped clusters , or to regions with unphysical ( negative ) density .",
    "nevertheless , we believe its extreme versatility makes it a useful tool for our purposes .",
    "+ for an ellipsoidal distribution , the 3-d shape of a cluster is described by two axis ratios , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and the orientation of the cluster is fixed by three euler angles , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tri0 ] ,  [ eq : gl2 ] ) , in our model the density profile of a cluster is characterized by three additional parameters : the central density @xmath55 , the slope @xmath3 and a core radius , @xmath56 . under the hypothesis of isothermal icm",
    ", a single value , @xmath10 , characterizes the temperature profile of the cluster . in all , nine parameters describe the cluster . +",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the cosmological dependence of the model enters through the luminosity - redshift relationship . for a flat model universe ,",
    "this relationship is in turn determined by two parameters : the hubble constant , @xmath2 , and the matter density @xmath32 . + a projected axis ratio , @xmath26 , and an orientation angle , @xmath57 , characterize a family of ellipses in the p.o.s .",
    "derived from the 2-d projection of 3-d ellipsoids . by fitting an elliptical profile to the x - ray and/or sze data ,",
    "these two parameters can ( in principle ) be measured .",
    "two other observables , the slope @xmath3 of the profile and the projected core radius @xmath27 can also be determined from data .",
    "two independent geometrical constraints relate 2-d and 3-d quantities ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : tri4e ] ,  [ eq : tri4f ] ) .",
    "+ so far we have discussed only quantities derivable from spatial distributions . besides these , the cluster central electron density and the temperature of the icm can be inferred from x - ray observations with sufficient energy resolution .",
    "the observed values of the central temperature decrement , @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sze3 ] ) and of the central surface brightness , @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sxb2 ] ) , provide two further constraints . if some assumption is made on the orientation of the cluster , with eight independent equations and eight unknown physical parameters a full determination of the cluster shape can be obtained .",
    "if a rotational ellipsoidal morphology is chosen , a lower number of parameters is needed to describe the three - dimensional shape of clusters ; in this case no additional assumption on the inclination is required allowing a full determination of the cluster shape and orientation . this case is treated in details in a subsequent paper  @xcite .",
    "we wish to point that , even though we do not do so in this work , strong lensing data can be combined with the x - ray and sze observations to break the degeneracy between the intrinsic shape of the lensing cluster and the cosmological parameters .",
    "if this were done , one could obtain simultaneous constraints on the cluster parameters and on the cosmology .",
    "+ in particular , each set of strong gravitational images identified in a cluster strongly constrains the mass distribution of the lens .",
    "the convergence @xmath58 depends on the cosmology only through the ratio of distances @xmath59 .",
    "therefore @xmath58 depends only the cosmological density parameters @xmath60 , and not on the hubble constant @xmath2 . the value of @xmath61 changes according to the redshift @xmath62 of the lensed source .",
    "image systems produced by sources at different redshifts probe independent values of the ratio @xmath63 .",
    "+ each image system provides a constraint on central value of the convergence @xmath64 ( eq .  [ eq : gl6b ] ) . in turn , if both the positions and the redshift of a multiple image system are known , each measured value of @xmath61 provides , through eq .",
    "( [ eq : gl6b ] ) , a further independent constraint on the cosmological energy densities .",
    "each multiply - imaged source provides an independent constraint which relates the cosmological parameters @xmath60 to the 3-d shape and orientation of the cluster ( @xmath65 ) . with a sufficient number of image systems , then , a measure of both the intrinsic shape and orientation of the cluster and a simultaneous estimate of all cosmological parameters involved can therefore be performed .",
    "it is of course well known that the angular diameter distance to a spherically symmetric cluster can be be inferred from microwave decrement and x - ray data .",
    "the angular diameter distance enters the sze and the x - ray emission through a characteristic length - scale of the cluster along the l.o.s .",
    "sze and x - ray emission depend differently on the density of icm , and therefore also on the assumed cosmology . a joint analysis of sze measurements and x - ray imaging observations , together with the assumption of spherical symmetry , thus can yield the distance to the cluster @xcite . specifically",
    ", one can solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sze3 ] ) and ( [ eq : sxb2 ] ) for the angular diameter distance @xmath22 , by eliminating @xmath66 .",
    "+ more generally , for a triaxial cluster the inferred angular diameter distance takes the form : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is an experimental quantity given by : @xmath69 under the assumption of spherical symmetry , the 3-d morphology of the cluster is completely known : @xmath70 , @xmath71 and the observed major core radius @xmath72 reduces to @xmath73 .",
    "hence eq .",
    "( [ eq : dis2 ] ) becomes : @xmath74 and the cluster angular diameter distance can therefore be obtained directly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : obl7 ] ) .",
    "the standard approach in the past decades has been to take advantage of this possibility to estimate @xmath22 under the assumption of spherical symmetry , in order to constrain the underlying cosmology . since in fact",
    "it is also true that @xmath75 , through eq .",
    "( [ eq : crit3 ] ) an estimate of @xmath2 can be obtained if @xmath76 and @xmath33 are known from independent observations  @xcite .",
    "+ the same approach clearly can not be applied when the assumption of spherical symmetry is relaxed and clusters are considered as more general triaxial systems . in this case",
    "an estimate of the axis ratios , shape and orientation parameters is required before @xmath22 can be computed .",
    "conversely , if @xmath22 is known from the redshift and prior knowledge of the cosmology , then the x - ray and sze data can be used to constrain the 3-d morphology of the cluster . in this paper",
    "we will follow this latter approach .",
    "we assume the values of @xmath60 and of @xmath2 to be known ; @xmath77 can be then determined through eq .",

    "we will then use eq .",
    "( [ eq : dis2 ] ) to infer the 3-d morphology of a sample of galaxy clusters .",

    "an impressive body of evidence from cmb anisotropy , type ia supernovae , galaxy clustering , large - scale structure , and the ly@xmath78 forest  @xcite are consistent with a the picture of a universe with sub - critical cold dark matter energy density and with two - thirds of the critical density being in the form of dark energy .",
