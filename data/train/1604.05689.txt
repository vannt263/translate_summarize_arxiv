    "smartphone users frequently encounter battery and energy problems . from the popular internet blogs",
    "@xcite , we have identified two issues that are increasingly being reported by the users ; sudden drop in the battery level and disgraceful shutdown of the device even with high battery levels being reported to the user ( even at 80% ) while discharging .",
    "these observations are reported across different smartphone models , and even for laptops .",
    "this disgraceful shutdown may bar users from their scheduled phone activities and result in data loss . from a user s perspective , the remaining battery life of a smartphone may even converge to the monetary value  @xcite .",
    "many smartphone manufacturers have recently introduced battery replacement programs that cover batteries that have a reduced capacity , typically below 80%  @xcite .",
    "the current smartphone battery discussion pertains to the following questions : _ why does the battery level fluctuate ?",
    "is the battery faulty ? is the problem due to an operating system upgrade or installing / upgrading an application?_.    our prior work  @xcite demonstrated that the answers to the earlier questions are related to the smartphone full charge capacity ( fcc ) .",
    "fcc is the maximum amount of charge an empty battery can hold . as the battery of a smartphone ages , the full charge capacity decreases with the utilization .",
    "fcc is typically modeled as a function of the number of charging cycles or the age of the battery , or measured with coulomb counting technique .",
    "this functionality or measurement capability resides inside a smart battery .",
    "the battery shares this estimates as percentage with the hosting device , such as smartphone ( see section  [ sec : soc ] ) .",
    "therefore , an indication of the capacity loss along with the battery level would allow more accurate power consumption modeling , sophisticated energy - aware scheduling mechanisms by the system and different applications .    in this article , we examine the performance of smartphone batteries and present a novel fcc estimation technique that can infer the fcc and fcc loss .",
    "the approach works whether a smart battery is capable to measure fcc or not , and therefore enables any device to estimate the fcc of the attached battery .",
    "we discover that the battery voltage and battery capacity relative charging rate , i.e. , c - rate , curves can characterize the fcc of a smartphone battery given the reference curves of the new battery .",
    "based on these findings , we devise a new fcc estimation method .",
    "our evaluation suggests that the estimation error is limited to 10% of the true value .",
    "our technique can be implemented , for instance , as a mobile application or it can be integrated into the operating system of the mobile device to monitor battery capacity health without the need to deploy new hardware . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our fcc estimation technique is a new approach .    in order to facilitate large scale battery health analytics , we also present a crowdsourced approach that works with battery voltage and charging rate information solely obtained from a crowdsourced data set . in order to study the capacity loss of the devices that contribute to such a data set , we derive a reference voltage and a c - rate curve from the data set for each model using a statistical approach , and then apply our fcc estimation method that compares the charging rate of a device with the model specific reference rate .",
    "we demonstrate that this method works relatively well for most models found in the carat data set  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we discovered that 55% of all the 9560 devices had some capacity loss , and that within 357 unique models at least one device in 330 models suffered from capacity loss .",
    "we summarize our contributions as follows .    *",
    "we investigate the behavior of battery voltage of smartphones while charging and reveal the relationship between battery voltage and the remaining battery capacity .",
    "the voltage for a specific state of charge ( soc ) of a battery with reduced capacity is higher than that of a new battery , and the voltage reaches its maximum value at a lower value of the soc as the fcc decreases .",
    "we also investigate the charging rate behavior and observe that the relative charging rate of the battery increases as the fcc decreases .",
    "consequently , we propose and validate a new battery full charge capacity estimation model , which works with different soc estimation techniques .",
    "the model yields estimates with an accuracy of 90% or more according to our evaluation .",
    "* we introduce a crowdsourced fcc estimation technique .",
    "although the accuracy of the approach depends on the diversity of the community , a study with the large scale carat data set shows that our collaborative technique estimates the reference rates of popular smartphone models within a 10% error margin .",
    "we also examine the presence of devices with reduced fcc in the carat data set .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : soc ] presents a smartphone power management primer . in section  [ sec : three ] , we investigate battery voltage and charging current behavior while charging the smartphones .",
    "we present and validate a rate - based fcc estimation model in section  [ sec : fcc ] . the crowdsourced battery analytic data set and the battery fcc estimation technique are described in section  [ sec : five ] . the limitations of our fcc estimation methods are discussed in section  [ sec : seven ] and compared with related work in section  [ sec : eight ] .",
    "finally , we draw conclusions from this paper in section  [ sec : nine ] .",
    "smartphone power management comprises a battery , a fuel gauge chip , and a charging controller . the chip with soc estimation functionality is often called fuel / gas gauge .",
    "the functionality of a fuel gauge chip may be distributed between the battery pack and the host system , i.e. , smartphone  @xcite .",
    "the smartphone only queries the battery for the supported information , such as soc , battery voltage , and temperature .",
    "the block diagram in figure  [ fig : charging_block ] illustrates how these components work together .",
    "smartphones are mostly charged using either an ac wall or a usb charger .",
    "the charging controller applies constant current - constant voltage ( cc - cv ) charging method . during the cc period ,",
    "the charging current is constant until the battery voltage reaches a specified maximum ( 4.2/4.35v ) , after which the charging current is trickled until the battery is fully charged .",
    "the charging terminates when the charging rate reduces to 0.07c or to a lower cut - off charging current specified by the manufacturer  @xcite . in this case",
    ", c is the rate that is relative to the battery capacity as follows : if the capacity of a battery is 2600 mah and it takes one hour to fully charge / discharge a battery , it means that 2600 ma rate is equivalent to 1 c for that battery .",
    "similarly , 0.5 c - rate is equivalent to 1300 ma for that battery . in presence of system load ,",
    "the charging controller may deliver lower current to the battery pack ( see section  [ sub : chg_proc ] ) .",
    "smartphones are powered with single cell battery packs . along with the cell ,",
    "a battery pack may also host soc / fcc measurement functionalities and such batteries are called smart batteries .",
    "the battery pack may also include a protection mechanism , as shown in figure  [ fig : charging_block ] , to guard against higher voltage and current from the device .",
    "the fcc of a battery decreases as it ages and it is an irreversible process .",
    "the capacity reduction happens through progressive chemical reactions .",
    "graphite is the common material used as anode in lithium - ion batteries and there are multiple anode - cathode pairs in a battery .",
    "as the battery is being charged , the oxidization of the graphite constructs a layer , called passive surface layer  @xcite .",
    "if the outer shell is leaked , then the oxidization happens faster due to moisture and the capacity loss accelerates .      based on the manufacturer , a fuel gauge chip may be able to measure or estimate the fcc along with soc .",
    "* soc estimation *  the soc is the runtime estimate of the battery charge .",
    "a soc value of 0 and 100 imply an empty and fully charged battery , respectively .",
    "the most common approach to estimate soc is to use open circuit voltage ( ocv ) with a number of look - up tables .",
    "a voltage based fuel gauge may also combine both ocv and load voltage to estimate soc or energy drain  @xcite .",
    "the second approach is coulomb counting , which introduces a sense register on the charge and discharge path as shown in figure  [ fig : charging_block ] .",
    "table  [ tab : fuelgauge_info ] describes a number of soc estimation techniques used by the modern fuel gauge chips .",
    ".characteristics of different fuel gauge solutions .",
    "coulomb counter - based solutions mostly reside in the battery . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : carat_results ]    similar to the voltage curve , we also construct model specific rate curves . to this end",
    ", we first select the one percent charging time curve constructed from the reference voltage curve samples in section  [ sub : methodology ] . unlike the voltage curve ,",
    "the charging time curve is required to have charging time for all the socs within the cc phase boundary , which is equivalent to the first two segments of the voltage curve .",
    "the line 7 in alg .",
    "[ alg : cevent ] shows that the length of the charging time curve is equivalent to the cc phase length determined from the voltage curve .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : onepercurve ] , these curves are almost parallel to x - axis within the soc boundary .",
    "therefore , we simply use linear interpolation to predict the missing values .",
    "naturally the corresponding time curve also may contain outliers .",
    "the figure shows that the charging time within the soc boundary follows normal distribution and thus we apply the @xmath0 and interpolation to find and replace the outliers ( _ line 8 , 9 , alg.[alg : cevent ] _ ) .",
    "once we have the charging time curve of a model , we apply equation to obtain the cumulative rate curve . from the rate curve we select the c - rate of the cc phase soc boundary .",
    "the third column in table  [ tab : carat_results ] presents the c - rate computed from the data set .",
    "we find that the galaxy s2/s3/s4 device rates are within @xmath1c compared to what we measured in section  [ sec : fcc ] .",
    "we further investigate the effectiveness of our crow - sourced rate estimation technique .",
    "we looked for the battery capacity and the charging current for some other models in the table .",
    "we have identified sch - i535 , sph - l710 , sgh - i747 m , sgh - t999 are galaxy s3 models , and sch - i545 is galaxy s4 model . from internet ,",
    "we have also collected the capacity and the charging current of other models .",
    "these c - rates are of less confidence and marked italic in the fourth column of the table .",
    "we notice that the crowdsourced reference rates are within @xmath20.09 c of their computed values for these popular models . from the model - specific rate we find the coefficients of the capacity model as discussed in section 4.3 .",
    "we next find the devices with reduced fcc . in order to do that we compare the rate from the model - specific reference curve with the rate from user specific rate curve ( _ line 12 - 23 , alg .",
    "[ alg : cevent ] _ ) . as our interest is the latest battery capacity of a device , we construct the one percent charging time curve from the voltage curve of a device from the samples of the latest month available .",
    "we select the maximum voltage per soc , as it guarantees less device utilization and the recent state of the battery at the same time .",
    "again , it is important to have adequate number of samples for a user curve as well .",
    "we consider only those users who had at least 25 samples within the soc boundary of the second segment .",
    "similar to the model reference curves , we also detect outliers and apply linear interpolation for estimating the missing values in the user - specific curves .",
    "once , we have the user c - rate , we compute the capacity loss using the model .    among 9560 user devices , 5311 devices of 333 models",
    "had reduced battery capacity . the sixth column in table  [ tab : carat_results ]",
    "shows that more than 50% of the devices of nine popular models had reduced battery capacity .",
    "the ratio of such users is the lowest with galaxy s4 ( gt - i9505 ) and nexus 5 . on the other hand , more than 70% galaxy s2 , nexus 7 , and sch - i535 devices suffered from capacity loss .",
    "the range of fcc losses for these users are illustrated as boxplots in figure  [ fig : devloss ] .",
    "we can see that most of the devices of these models had less than 40% capacity loss .",
    "we looked into the length of cc phases of user devices and found that around 38 devices among all the devices had cc phase length of zero .",
    "in other words , these devices had significant capacity loss .",
    "the relation between battery capacity and charging cycles have been studied linear . in this section ,",
    "we try to foster the relation between battery capacity and the relative charging rate .",
    "we also emphasize the limitation of our fcc estimation methods .",
    "we look for a general relationship between c - rate and fcc . we have shown that the c - rate increases as the capacity decreases .",
    "now , given the c - rate using equation , we can find the recent fcc of a battery . in the equation , we increase the value of @xmath3 by 0.01 c and use the measured charging current .",
    "we find the corresponding capacity and plot in figure  [ fig : crate_profiles ] .",
    "we notice that for all our experimental devices , the relation between fcc and c - rate is an exponential decay function . from the figure it is also obvious that the decay function is model specific . in this way",
    ", it is possible to construct an exponential model or a profile consisting of capacity and rate value pairs for the battery of a device .",
    "once we have the profile , we simply just map the c - rate with the corresponding capacity . in the figure",
    ", we can see that capacity reduces almost 90% when c - rate increases by 2 c from the initial rate .",
    "the models for the experimental devices are annotated in figure  [ fig : crate_profiles ] .",
    "[ fig : crate_profiles ]    @xmath4    now , for the c - rate from the batterymanager updates , it is not straightforward to construct such model or profile , as most of the smartphones do not provide capacity and rate information .",
    "however , this c - rate can be expressed as the ratio of an arbitrary charging current and a capacity , e.g. , galaxy s3 c - rate derived from the batterymanager updates , @xmath5 .",
    "as long as the ratio remains equal , it is possible to construct a similar capacity estimation model .",
    "figure  [ fig : crate_profiles ] shows the comparison of the models constructed from two kinds of rates and we notice that the coefficients of the models are close of the respective devices .",
    "the goodness of their fits also have similar measures where , r - square is 0.99 and rmse is 0.007 - 0.008 for all devices .",
    "therefore , a general model can be expressed as  .",
    "if we plug in the difference of @xmath3 and @xmath6 values from table 2 to the with the corresponding device model coefficients , we would get the similar estimates presented in table .      in this work ,",
    "we have used the charging rates with both the ac and usb2.0 chargers .",
    "the proposed fcc estimation technique works regardless of underlying soc estimation technique or fuel gauge chip is being used by a device , but it s accuracy depends on the performance of these fuel gauge chips .",
    "we have shown that their accuracy is higher while charging than discharging . however , if the capacity reduces significantly so that the battery never experiences cc phase , our approach would underestimate the capacity loss .",
    "therefore , our approach is applicable as long as the length of the cc phase is higher than zero .",
    "the relation between fcc and the length of cc phase is our ongoing research .",
    "the limitation of crowdsourced approach is the number of unbiased samples and we have mentioned earlier that there are two competing sources of bias that affect the construction of the reference voltage and rate curves ; the samples gathered during active usage of the device and the samples from the lower fcc devices . for the active usage samples ,",
    "the reference rate of a model would be lower than the measured value in the laboratory and the crowdsourced approach would overestimate the capacity loss .",
    "for the latter case , model - specific rate would be higher than the measured value and the capacity loss would be underestimated .",
    "it is possible to overcome this bias by learning the rates as new unbiased samples arrive at the carat back - end from the users .",
    "this method is being integrated as carat s battery diagnosis feature .",
    "significant amount of research work focused on the energy consumption measurement and optimization of different applications and system  @xcite .",
    "a large body of research investigated the energy consumption of mobile devices through profiling , modeling , and debugging  @xcite .",
    "the profiling methods include novel techniques to trace the energy consumption from code to different hardware components @xcite .",
    "such profilers also depend on the power consumption modeling .",
    "the state - of - the art power modeling approaches rely on on - device resource profiling and battery information .",
    "powerbooter  @xcite relies on soc updates and ocv discharge curves to build the regression based power models .",
    "v - edge  @xcite and batttracker  @xcite rely on soc updates , ocv and the load voltage to model power consumption .",
    "sesame  @xcite , appscope  @xcite , and devscope  @xcite rely on soc updates and current drawn estimates from the coulomb counter - based fuel gauges .",
    "carat relies on soc updates to compute the energy ratings of different applications for different energy models towards finding the energy hogs and bugs .",
    "we also depend on battery manager updates .",
    "we specifically use soc update time to find the charging rates and use the battery voltage to determine the length of the cc phase .",
    "however , we estimate the fcc of the battery .",
    "our approach works irrespective the soc estimation or fuel gauge chip used by the device .    the discharge rate of the battery increases for the same usage  @xcite , as the lithium - ion battery ages .",
    "consequently , the reported power consumption will be higher than the true value for an aged battery .",
    "the accuracy of the self - metering profilers is intertwined with the age of the battery and will decrease as the age of the battery increases .",
    "for this reason , the self - metering profilers may require retraining of their models .",
    "precise quantification of its effect on the accuracy would require further evaluation of the profilers with batteries of different ages and so far has been an open question .",
    "battery fcc estimation model enables more accurate modeling by identifying the inefficiency of the energy source of the smartphone .",
    "a number of data - driven strategies exist that predict the capacity as the battery ages and the number of charging cycle increases .",
    "yin et al .",
    "@xcite and liu et al .",
    "@xcite applied a few variations of the gaussian process regression to predict the capacity as a function of charging cycle .",
    "the earlier approaches rely on the vendor provided data on fcc and charging cycles .",
    "barr et al .",
    "@xcite studied how the discharge rates can be used to predict the life of lithium - ion battery in electric vehicles . based on the discharge voltage and current during an activity , such as acceleration , they proposed a data driven real - time battery capacity prediction framework .",
    "compared to these related work , we focus on estimating capacity proactively .",
    "our technique does not require any additional hardware or system modification .",
    "therefore , the approach can be easily implemented as a part of the mobile system and can be integrated with different applications or operating system initiated optimizations .",
    "for example , the sdb proposed by badam et al .",
    "@xcite can include a fcc aware battery scheduling , where sdb will learn the fcc of an individual battery while charging and then schedule the batteries accordingly while discharging .",
    "in this article , we have shown that the battery voltage and rate curves can capture the fcc of lithium - ion batteries . based on this observation , we proposed and validated an online mechanism to estimate the fcc or the capacity loss .",
    "we also implemented and validated a crowdsourced mechanism .",
    "we found 30 - 57% of devices of popular models having significant capacity loss in a large data set of mobile devices . compared to the traditional approaches ,",
    "our approach is device based and can be used to debug the performance of smartphone batteries . in addition , this work paves the way of modeling and implementing fcc - aware energy optimizations of mobile systems and applications .",
