    "bouncing cosmologies and more specifically the matter bounce scenario ( see @xcite for a review of this kind of cosmologies ) is the most promising alternative to the inflationary paradigm .",
    "there are many ways to obtain cosmologies without the big bang singularity : for example violating the null energy condition in general relativity by incorporating new forms of matter such as phantom @xcite or quintom fields @xcite , galileons @xcite or phantom condensates @xcite , or by adding terms to einstein - hilbert action @xcite , but the simplest one is to go beyond general relativity and consider holonomy corrected loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) , where a big bounce replaces the big bang singularity @xcite .",
    "in fact , other future singularities such as type i ( big rip ) and type iii ( big freeze ) are also forbbiden in holonomy corrected lqc @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that a matter domination period in the contracting phase is dual to the de sitter regime in the expanding phase @xcite , which provides a flat power spectrum of cosmological perturbations in the matter bounce scenario . moreover ,",
    "an abrupt ekpyrotic phase transition is needed , in the contracting phase , in order to solve the famous belinsky - khalatnikov - lifshitz ( bkl ) instability : the effective energy density of primordial anisotropy scales as @xmath1 in the contracting phase @xcite and , more important , to produce enough particles which will be responsible for thermalizing the universe in the expanding phase @xcite .",
    "this new scenario named matter - ekpyrotic scenario was introduced in @xcite , being developed within the two - field model in @xcite , while in @xcite there is a numerical discussion on the primordial anisotropy issue ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it was treated in the context of loop quantum cosmology in @xcite , showing that it could be compatible with the new experimental data @xcite provided by planck s team ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to study mathematically , from the viewpoint of the dynamical systems theory , the matter - ekpyrotic scenario in the context of holonomy corrected lqc .",
    "more precisely , we study its background dynamics and the evolution of cosmological scalar perturbations in this scenario , showing that it leads to a nearly flat power spectrum of perturbations , whose spectral index and running match correctly with the recent experimental data .",
    "moreover , we will also point out that the phase transition , in the contracting epoch , from matter domination to the ekpyrotic phase , is the responsible for the production of enough particles whose energy density , in the expanding phase , will be dominant , leading to a reheating temperature compatible with the nucleosynthesis bounds .",
    "the work is organized as follows : the dynamical study of the matter - ekpyrotic scenario in general relativity is performed in section ii . in section iii",
    "we study the dynamics of the background , demonstrating that in loop quantum cosmology the matter - ekpyrotic scenario has two different regimes : at very early times , the universe in the contracting phase is matter dominated and evolves to an ekpyrotic regime , and after the bounce , we show that the universe leaves the ekpyrotic phase and enters in a kination ( or deflationary ) regime @xcite .",
    "section iv is devoted to the calculation of the power spectrum of scalar perturbations in this scenario , showing that the power spectrum is proportional to the square of the value of the hubble parameter at the transition time .",
    "the mechanism to reheat the universe is studied in section v , where we show that the phase transition from the matter to the ekpyrotic regime is essential to produce enough particles to reheat the universe . in last section ,",
    "we build a simple potential in this scenario that leads to theoretical values of the spectral index and its running that fit well with the last observational data provided by planck s team .",
    "the units used throughout the paper are @xmath2 and , thus , the reduced planck s mass is @xmath3 .",
    "in this section , we consider the flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric in the context of general relativity .",
    "then , the friedmann , conservation and raychauduri equations are respectively given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hubble parameter , @xmath6 the energy density and @xmath7 the pressure .",
    "to achieve the matter - ekpyrotic scenario we will deal with a single scalar field , namely @xmath8 .",
    "then , the energy density and pressure are @xmath9 being @xmath10 the potential .",
    "our first goal is to mimick , with a single scalar field @xmath8 , a fluid with equation of state ( eos ) @xmath11 , i.e. , we want to obtain a potential @xmath10 which provides a solution of the conservation equation that leads to the same background as a barotropic fluid with eos @xmath11 , where @xmath12 .",
    "the first step is to write the eos @xmath11 as follows @xmath13 which means that for @xmath14 the potential must be positive , negative for @xmath15 , and vanishes for @xmath16 .    on the other hand , for a fluid with eos @xmath11 ,",
    "the friedmann and conservation equations of general relativity could be easily solved , giving as a result the background @xmath17    secondly , using the raychauduri equation @xmath18 one has @xmath19 , and if we only consider increasing functions , i.e. , @xmath20 we will obtain @xmath21 where @xmath22 ( resp .",
    "@xmath23 ) refers to the contracting ( resp . expanding )",
    "in fact , @xmath24 is defined for @xmath25 , and @xmath26 in @xmath27 .",
    "finally , to reconstruct the potential we use the relation @xmath11 and the raychaudhuri equation , to obtain @xmath28    using , a simple calculation leads to @xmath29 and , by writing @xmath30 , the analytical solution becomes @xmath31      once we have obtained the potential for a single scalar field , the dynamical equations ( friedmann and conservation ) are @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "the conservation equation is a second order differential equation , meaning that there are infinitely many solutions that depict different universes .",
    "for example , if one deals in the expanding phase , i.e. we take @xmath34 , then for the potential @xmath35 , the analytical solution @xmath36 with @xmath37 , defines a universe with eos @xmath11 all the time . however , the other solutions do not define a universe with this eos all the time .",
    "for this reason , what we want to study is the behaviour of the analytical solution , i.e. , we want to know whether the orbit in the plane @xmath38 defined by the solution ( [ 8 ] ) will be an attractor or a repeller .    to do that , first of all we study the dynamics in the contracting phase .",

    "then , since the observational values of the power spectrum states @xmath205 , one will deduce that @xmath206 .    to reproduce mathematically this result we consider , for @xmath207 , the solution in the long wave - lenght approximation @xmath208 then matching at @xmath183 one obtains @xmath209    that is , @xmath210 because for modes well outside to the hubble radius one has @xmath211 .",
    "first we are interested in the evolution of @xmath212 during the ekpyrotic regime .",
    "for this reason we will calculate @xmath213 where we have used that , during the ekpyrotic phase , @xmath214    performing the change of variable @xmath215 one obtains @xmath216.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the integrals that appear in this expression are of the same order as @xmath217 @xmath218 because in this model @xmath219 .    finally , using that @xmath220 , we will get @xmath221 and , approximately , we have @xmath222    during the deflationary phase , the curvature fluctuation evolves as @xmath223    thus , performing the matching at @xmath224 one obtains @xmath225",
    "the deflationary regime ends when the universe becomes reheated and enters in a radiation dominated phase . for this reason we have to calculate @xmath226    using the formulas @xmath227 and @xmath228 of @xcite @xmath229 and the fact that @xmath230 and @xmath231 , one obtains @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the reheating temperature .",
    "now , taking into account that in lqc @xmath234 and that the nucleosynthesis bounds impose @xmath235 , one has @xmath236    if we impose the first term on the right hand side to be greater than the second one , one will have the constraint @xmath237    now , with this assumption one will have @xmath238    when the universe enters in a radiation dominated phase one will have @xmath239 where the holonomy corrections could be disregarded and then , @xmath240 with @xmath241 . matching at @xmath242 one will get @xmath243    a simple integration shows that , at very late times @xmath244\\cong \\frac{c_2(k)}{6a_r^3h_r}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this last quantity is equal to @xmath245 where we have used that during the deflationary phase one has @xmath246    then , we conclude that , if @xmath199 satisfies the conditions @xmath247 , one will have @xmath248 , which means that the power spectrum is given by @xmath249 and thus , to match with observational data one has to choose @xmath250 .",
    "finally , the condition @xmath247 is fulfilled for @xmath251 .",
    "as we have already explained , when one deals with a matter dominated universe ( without the ekpyrotic phase transition ) , the power spectrum of cosmological perturbations is of the order @xmath105 , and since lqc provides a value around planck s density , its value is in contradiction with the current observations because it is too high .",
    "this is another reason to implement an ekpyrotic phase in the matter bounce scenario .",
    "we will consider a heavy massive quantum field , namely @xmath252 , conformally coupled with gravity , and first of all we consider the model ( [ cai - wilson ] ) proposed by @xcite .",
    "this model has been studied in @xcite , where it has been shown that the energy density of the produced particles is given by @xmath253    during the ekpyrotic phase , the background evolves as @xmath254 , then , since @xmath15 , during the contracting phase @xmath255 increases faster than @xmath256 , and thus , the universe continues being driven by the background . however , after the bounce , the universe enters in a kination ( @xmath16 ) regime and the background evolves as @xmath257 , where @xmath258 is the minimum value of the scale factor . since in the expanding phase @xmath6 decreases as @xmath1 and @xmath259 as @xmath260 , the energy density of the created particles will eventually start to dominate , and at that moment , namely @xmath261 , when both energy densities will be of the same order , the universe will become reheated with a temperature @xmath262 .    to calculate this temperature we use the identity @xmath263 to obtain @xmath264 where @xmath265 . and , thus , the reheating temperature is given by @xmath266    taking into account , as we have shown in section @xmath267 , that for @xmath268 one has @xmath269 , one will obtain in figure [ fig : tvsw1 ] the dependence of @xmath270 as a function of @xmath92 .     using formula ( [ xxx ] ) . ]    consequently , since nucleosynthesis bounds constrain the reheating temperature to be between @xmath271 and @xmath272 , from figure [fig : tvsw1 ] we can see that the matter - ekpyrotic model only holds when @xmath92 is of the order @xmath273",
    ". however , the reheating temperature is very high and is in the borderline . then , if one wants a lower reheating temperature , one has to consider a phase transition less abrupt than the one considered above . to do this",
    ", we will consider the model defined in next section , where in the phase transition the second derivative of the hubble parameter is discontinuous .",
    "assuming that the mass of the quantum field is very high , for example is of the order of the reduced planck mass , we could approximate the vacuum modes by its first order wkb solution , obtaining that the @xmath274 bogoliubov coefficient is given by @xcite @xmath275    the energy density of the produced particles is given by @xmath276    on the other hand , after the phase transition the energy density of the background evolves as @xmath277 , and after the bounce , since the universe enters in a kination domination , it evolves as @xmath257 , where the value of the scale factor at the bouncing time is given by formula .    in the contracting phase ,",
    "the energy density is always dominant , but in the expanding one it will eventually become subdominant .",
    "when both energy densities are of the same order the universe becomes reheated , this happens when @xmath278 where the constant @xmath279 has been introduced in .",
    "then , the reheating temperature will be @xmath280 where @xmath281 . and , after reheating , the universe is dominated by a thermalized relativistic plasma and matches with the standard hot friedmann universe .",
    "finally , from formula , if one takes , for instance , @xmath282 , one will obtain the picture drawn in figure [ fig : tvsw2 ] , which shows that the reheating temperatures belong to the range between @xmath271 and @xmath272 for values of @xmath92 up to order @xmath283 .     using formula . ]",
    "two final remarks are in order :    1 .",
    "when one considers very light particles non - conformally coupled with gravity , the energy density of the produced particles is @xmath284 @xcite , leading to the reheating temperature @xmath285 which , as we can see in figure [ fig : tvsw3 ] , is always greater that @xmath286 , i.e. , the matter - ekpyrotic bounce scenario only supports the creation of massless particles when the reheating temperature of the universe is very high . +   using the formula ( [ light ] ) . ] 2 .",
    "the difference between the matter - ekpyrotic scenario and the current models in quintessence inflation is that in the later one the phase transition occurs after the end of inflation and , thus , the value of the hubble parameter is of the order of @xmath287 @xcite , leading to a reheating temperature of the order of @xmath288 , which is less than the one obtained in matter - ekpyrotic lqc scenario .",
    "in the matter - ekpyrotic bounce scenario , for modes that leave the hubble radius at very early times , when the universe is matter dominated , the spectral index and its running are given by @xcite @xmath289    it is clear that a pure matter - ekpyrotic bouncing scenario leads to @xmath290    then , to match with the current observational data , one needs to improve this scenario introducing a quasi - matter domination period at very early times . to do this ,",
    "first of all one has to consider the raychaudhuri equation in lqc ( see for instance @xcite ) @xmath291 which for the linear eos @xmath11 becomes @xmath292    then , in the ekpyrotic phase one has to simply choose @xmath15 , and for quasi - matter domination one could choose @xmath293 ( we have written @xmath294 for convenience , but in principle @xmath295 can be positive or negative ) .",
    "however , at the phase transition , the derivative of the hubble parameter is discontinuous and , as we have seen in the previous section , this kind of models could be ruled out by the nucleosynthesis bounds due to its high reheating temperature .",
    "for this reason we need to match these dynamics in a continuous way , and a simple way to do this is presented in the following model @xmath296    note that in the contracting phase , near @xmath297 , since holonomy corrections could be disregarded , these dynamics could be written as follows @xmath298    moreover , the effective equation of state ( eos ) parameter , namely @xmath299 , is given by @xmath300    then , we can see that when @xmath301 one has @xmath302 , that is , the universe is quasi - matter dominated .",
    "on the other hand , the potential that leads to these dynamics could be obtained approximately using the reconstruction method , as follows : when holonomy corrections could be disregarded , raychaudhuri equation becomes @xmath303 , and then , @xmath304 , obtaining for our model , when @xmath305 @xmath306 where we have used formula @xmath307 of @xcite @xmath308    conversely , @xmath309    since , when holonomy corrections are disregarded , the potential is given by @xmath310 , one has approximately for @xmath311 @xmath312    on the contrary , as we have seen in section @xmath43 , in the ekpyrotic phase the potential is given by @xcite @xmath313 and , since for the potential one has @xmath314 , assuming the continuity of the potential at the transition phase one gets @xmath315    therefore , if one takes into account the approximation @xmath316 one will have @xmath317    summing up , the potential we propose in the matter - ekpyrotic bounce scenario is @xmath318    note that when @xmath319 the potential satisfies @xmath320 , that is , the universe is matter dominated at early times , and for @xmath321 the universe is in the ekpyrotic regime .    to perform the calculations , we choose , for example , as a pivot scale @xmath322 where subindex @xmath102 means the current time , and we choose , as usual , @xmath323 @xcite . to calculate the value of @xmath324",
    "we need the current value of the scale factor which could be calculated as follows :    for the sake of simplicity we take @xmath325 .",
    "then , from equation , the value of the scale factor at the beginning of the radiation era will satisfy @xmath326 .",
    "now , we use the relation @xcite @xmath327 to obtain @xmath328 , where we have used that the current temperature of the universe is @xmath329 , and that for @xmath16 the reheating temperature is @xmath330 .",
    "consequently , @xmath331 and , thus since @xmath332 , one concludes that @xmath333 .    on the other hand ,",
    "let @xmath334 be the time when the pivot scale leaves the hubble radius during the quasi - matter domination in the contracting phase .",
    "then one will have @xmath335 , which means @xmath336 because the pivot scale leaves the hubble radius , in the contracting phase , before the phase transition .",
    "then , we can conclude that @xmath337 , and thus @xmath338 and @xmath339    planck13 observational data at @xmath340 c.l .",
    "give the following results : @xmath341 and @xmath342 .",
    "then , to match our theoretical model , with the @xmath94-marginalized domain for the spectral index at @xmath150 c.l .",
    ", one has to choose the effective eos parameter @xmath343 satisfying @xmath344    on the other hand , since @xmath345 we can see that the theoretical value of the running enters in the @xmath94- marginalized domain for the running at @xmath150 c.l .",
    "a final important remark is in order : as pointed out in @xcite , in the matter - ekpyrotic scenario , dealing with the analytical solution , the power spectrum of tensor and scalar perturbations are of the same order .",
    "this means that the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations , namely @xmath346 , does not satisfy the constraint @xmath347 .",
    "there are several ways to address this problem , one of them is to consider at @xmath348cdm universe at early times @xcite because , due to the small velocity of sound , this increases the power spectrum of scalar perturbations and conserves the power spectrum of tensor ones , that is , it suppresses the tensor / scalar ratio .",
    "however , one has to realize that these calculations are performed for analytical solutions , but when one deals with a scalar field there are infinitely many solutions , then for some of these solutions , as has been shown numerically in @xcite for the simple case of a matter dominated universe , some of them suppress the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations satisfying the bound @xmath347 provided by the joint analysis data from bicep2/keck array and planck @xcite .",
    "thus , in the present case some numerical calculations might support this fact .",
    "this is , of course , a point that deserves future investigation .",
    "in the present work we have shown , with all the mathematical details , that the matter - ekpyrotic bounce scenario in loop quantum cosmology , whose background has a matter domination regime in the contracting phase at very early times followed by a phase transition to an ekpyrotic epoch up to the bounce where the universe enters in a kination phase , is a promising alternative to the inflationary paradigm , because it leads to theoretical values of some spectral parameters - the power spectrum of scalar perturbations , the spectral index and its running- that match at @xmath150 confidence level with the current observational data . moreover , the phase transition , produced in the contracting phase , is able to produce enough particles -very massive conformally coupled with gravity or massless non conformally coupled- to reheat the universe , in the expanding phase , at temperatures compatible with the bounds coming from nucleosynthesis , and thus , matching with the hot friedmann universe .",
