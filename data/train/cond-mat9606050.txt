    "the electronic shell structure observed in mass spectra of metal clusters can be rather well described by an independent electron model . treating the valence electrons of the cluster as an ideal fermi gas moving in an external potential @xmath3 , a shell structure arises from the discreteness of energy levels for particles confined to a finite volume",

    "it has been pointed out that quantities of the type @xmath8 characterize two exactly solvable quantum mechanical problems : the hydrogen atom , in which levels with the same @xmath1 are degenerate , and the isotropic harmonic oscillator , where the degeneracy is described by the quantum number @xmath2 . with this analogy in mind",
    "it has been conjectured@xcite that there might be a set of solutions of the radial schrdinger equation displaying the degeneracy described by the quantum number @xmath0 .    at first sight",

    "the theorem states that only for central potentials of the form @xmath9 and @xmath10 _ all _ bounded orbits are closed.@xcite assuming that this property is caused by a dynamical symmetry of the system which uniquely corresponds to a symmetry of the quantized system , this would imply that only these two problems exhibit `` accidental '' degeneracies .",
    "unfortunately the situation is not that simple .",
    "while it is known that the degeneracies for the quantum mechanical kepler problem and the harmonic oscillator are a consequence of the dynamical symmetries @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , it turns out that _ all _ classical systems involving 3 degrees of freedom automatically possess both @xmath11 _ and _",

    "@xmath17 is the full symmetry .",
    "there are , however , special cases in which the eigenspaces of the hamiltonian are reducible .",
    "examples are the hydrogen atom and the isotropic harmonic oscillator . for the former , energy levels @xmath5 having the quantum number @xmath1 in common are degenerate , for the latter the respective quantum number is @xmath2 .",
    "it is well known that these degeneracies are not accidental , rather they are the consequence of a symmetry higher than spherical . for the hydrogen atom",
    "this symmetry is described by the algebra @xmath11 while for the harmonic oscillator the symmetry algebra is the @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite having identified @xmath0 as a candidate for a new quantum number , the question arises as to whether the corresponding degeneracy is also due to some hidden symmetry .    to answer this question",
    ", we exploit the fact that eigenspaces of a hamiltonian are representation spaces of its symmetry algebra . in particular",
    ", the dimensions of these spaces must coincide .",
    "fortunately , representation theory @xcite provides us with all the information needed .",
    "the irreducible representations of the classical lie algebras ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , corresponding to the algebras @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 in the complete classification scheme of all semisimple lie algebras ) can be labeled using the cartan subalgebra . for a lie algebra of rank @xmath28",

    "they can be chosen such that they have integer eigenvalues .",
    "for any given representation one can find a basis which diagonalizes the operators in the cartan subalgebra .",
    "each basis vector is then characterized by the corresponding integer vector of eigenvalues @xmath29 , its ` weight ' .",

    "the dimension of the irreducible representation with highest weight @xmath30 is given by weyl s dimensionality formula @xmath31 the constants @xmath32 and the set @xmath33 of positive roots only depend on the type of the lie algebra , not on any particular representation .",

    "similarly for the harmonic oscillator the eigenspaces could be the irreducible representation spaces of @xmath46 with highest weights @xmath47  again , as indeed it is .",
    "for the quantum number @xmath0 the situation is fundamentally different .",
    "the degeneracies of the eigenspaces are no longer given by a closed formula , i.e.  there is no simple relation between the quantum number and the highest weights of some lie algebra . if there existed a quantum mechanical operator corresponding to the quantum number , which would be a casimir operator of the symmetry algebra , then such a simple relation should exist , since the eigenvalues of a casimir operator are given by rational functions in the highest weights.@xcite thus , we can not find a classical lie algebra that could cause a degeneracy corresponding to the quantum number @xmath0 .",
    "the same reasoning holds for quantum numbers @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "an elegant approach to exactly solvable problems is provided by supersymmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "@xcite the basic idea of the method is that a given hamiltonian @xmath50 can be factorized if the energy of the ground state @xmath51 is set to zero : @xmath52 here the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath53 . reversing the order in the factorization",
    ", a new hamiltonian @xmath54 can be defined .",
    "it is called the supersymmetric partner of @xmath55 . obviously the @xmath56 intertwine",
    "the hamiltonians : @xmath57 thus , except for the ground state of @xmath55 , which is annihilated by @xmath58 , the spectra of the hamiltonians @xmath59 are identical .",

    "@xcite in what follows we shall refer to the expression in equation ( [ shapeinvar ] ) as the shape - invariance condition . in such a case , starting from the potential @xmath65 , a whole sequence @xmath66 of supersymmetric partner potentials can be constructed . from the knowledge of the ground - state energy in the potential @xmath67 as a function of the parameters @xmath68 , the whole spectrum of the initial hamiltonian @xmath55",
    "can be obtained : @xmath69    we now investigate whether a radial problem with degeneracies according to the quantum number @xmath0 can be constructed using the above ideas .",
    "more specifically , we are looking for any potential @xmath70 such that energy levels with different angular momentum @xmath7 are degenerate .",
    "for the radial potentials @xmath71 the shape - invariance condition ( [ shapeinvar ] ) reads @xmath72 using ( [ radpot ] ) this can be rewritten as @xmath73 where we have introduced the notations @xmath74 inserting ( [ vsuper ] ) into ( [ radshapeinvii ] ) , we obtain a differential equation for the superpotential @xmath75 , the general solution of which is @xmath76 the corresponding potentials are @xmath77 the choices @xmath78 and @xmath79 will make @xmath80 a radial potential with angular momentum @xmath7 . to ensure that we can normalize the ground state , the parameters in the above equations",

    ", we find exactly two solutions of the shape - invariance condition : @xmath84 the first solution corresponds to the hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom . setting @xmath85 we obtain the energy spectrum @xmath86 pertaining to the coulomb potential @xmath87 .",
    "writing the constant in the second solution as @xmath88 we find the spectrum of the harmonic oscillator @xmath89 : @xmath90 obviously , the spectra of these systems are characterized by degeneracies according to the quantum numbers @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "thus we have shown that there exist exactly two physically acceptable _ radial _ potentials which fulfill the shape - invariance condition ( [ radshapeinv ] ) , namely those associated with the quantum numbers @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it thus appears that these two quantum numbers are unique .",
    "clearly , arguments of the type given above can only exclude the existence of a system with quantum number @xmath0 under the assumption of some specific mechanism ( e.g. ,  classical symmetry or supersymmetry ) that would cause the degeneracy .",
    "thus , by such reasoning it is not possible to give a general proof that such a system can not exist .",
    "furthermore , it is conceivable that @xmath0 is only an approximative quantum number , i.e.  that levels of quantum number @xmath0 are not exactly but merely near - degenerate .",
    "therefore , we will now approach the problem at hand from a completely different direction .",
    "we try to construct cluster - potentials exhibiting degeneracies according to @xmath0 by numerical optimization .",
    "the basic idea is to transform the continuous eigenvalue problem for the hamiltonian @xmath91 into a finite dimensional problem by discretizing the schrdinger equation . discretizing the potential @xmath92 the eigengenvalues can be considered as _",
    "functions _ of a finite number of potential parameters @xmath93 instead of being _ functionals _ of the potential : @xmath94 \\approx \\epsilon_{n , l}\\big(\\{v_i\\}\\big).\\ ] ] a potential with the postulated @xmath0 degeneracy can then be found by numerically optimizing a suitable initial potential with respect to a cost function , which measures the deviation from the desired degeneracy . by a straightforward application of the above strategy",
    "we have found that the @xmath93 s for successive @xmath95 s oscillate wildly .",
    "for such potentials @xmath96 the approximation ( [ ediscrete ] ) is clearly invalid .",
    "thus we have imposed a constraint on the @xmath93 s to keep the potential smooth .",
    "furthermore we have made sure that the number of electrons the potential can hold for a given fermi energy does not vary too much .",
    "we have performed such optimizations starting from woods - saxon potentials @xmath97 with sodium - like parameters ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) for varying cluster sizes @xmath100 .",
    "for the discretization we have used a mesh of step width @xmath101 .",
    "= 3.37 in    a cost function has measured the non - degeneracy of the energy levels , the smoothness of the potential and the variation in the number of electrons that fit into the potential for a given fermi energy . to find",
    "the non - degeneracy we have determined for each quantum number @xmath102 the average energy @xmath103 the deviation of the eigenstates from the desired degeneracy was then defined as @xmath104 as a measure of the roughness of the potential represented by the @xmath93 we have used the expression @xmath105 which disfavors sharp bends in @xmath106 .",
    "the number of electrons fitting into the potential was estimated by the thomas - fermi expression @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the classical turning point for the potential @xmath106 .",
    "since the woods - saxon potential has only a finite number of bound states , the summation ( [ nondegen ] ) has to end at some maximal @xmath35 , which we will denote by @xmath109 .    to demonstrate that with the above measures we indeed can find potentials with a given degeneracy , we have    = 3.37 in    = 6.75 in    2 tested our program on the quantum number @xmath2 .",
    "we start from the sodium - like woods - saxon potential that we also use for the @xmath0-optimizations .",
    "although this initial potential is much closer to a @xmath0 than to a @xmath2-degeneracy , it turns out that during optimization the energy levels are very easily arranged into equidistant shells . for all choices of @xmath109 nearly perfect degeneracy",
    "is achieved for the shells with @xmath110 .",
    "interestingly , even the levels which are excluded from the cost function ( i.e.  those above @xmath109 ) tend to form degenerate shells . figure [ harmopt ] shows the energy spectrum along with the potential resulting from the optimization of a woods - saxon potential with @xmath111 .",
    "as can be seen the optimized potential approximates well the quadratic potential ( indicated by the dash - dotted line ) associated with the @xmath2 degeneracy , although it is very different from the initial potential ( dotted line).@xcite    the results of the optimizations for the quantum number @xmath0 are quite different .",
    "they are shown in figure [ potpanel ] . to make the results for different cluster sizes comparable , we have chosen @xmath109 to correspond always to the shell closest to fermi energy .",
    "it turns out that for small clusters the energy levels can be forced to form nearly degenerate shells according to the quantum number @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding potentials , however , exhibit large oscillations inside the cluster .",
    "these seem to be fairly unrealistic , when compared to those obtained form self - consistent calculations.@xcite for larger clusters the situation becomes even worse . here , although the optimized potentials oscillate strongly , degeneracy can merely be achieved for the states with @xmath0 just below @xmath109 . in other words , only just below @xmath112 a grouping of almost degenerate energy levels can be observed . above and",
    "further below @xmath109 there are no large gaps in the spectrum , and hence no shells .",
    "the above results suggest that the outcome of a degeneracy optimization strongly depends on @xmath109 , indicating that there is no unique ` cluster potential ' which could be approximated by the optimized potentials . to demonstrate this dependence ,",
    "we have performed calculations with different values of @xmath109 for a fixed cluster size .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ levpanel ] . at the top the woods - saxon potential , which was used as starting point in the optimization runs , along with its energy spectrum is plotted . on the left - hand side",
    "the potential is shown as in fig .",
    "[ potpanel ] ( except that we restrict the energy axis to a smaller range ) . to the right",
    "the eigenstates @xmath5 are arranged according to their angular momenta @xmath7 .",
    "states belonging to the same shell @xmath102 are connected by a dotted curve .",
    "a shell @xmath113 is ( near-)degenerate if this curve is a horizontal line .",
    "the greater its slope , the worse the degeneracy . optimizing the potential for two different values of @xmath109 results in the potentials shown in the lower part of fig .  [ levpanel ] .",
    "these potentials are markedly different .",
    "not only the amplitude of the oscillations , even the number of maxima in @xmath106 changes with @xmath109 . as can be seen from the spectra on the right hand side",
    "the dotted curves connecting states , which belong to the same shell @xmath102 are concave for @xmath114 and convex for @xmath115 . comparing the spectra for @xmath116 and @xmath117",
    ", we observe that there is a tradeoff between straightening out the dotted lines above @xmath118 and bending those corresponding to smaller quantum numbers ; i.e.  it seems to be impossible to obtain the desired degeneracy for _ all _ shells .",
    "furthermore it turns out that the higher @xmath109 ( i.e.the more states are included in the cost function ) , the stronger are the oscillations in @xmath106 .    if a ` cluster potential ' having a shape similar to a woods - saxon potential existed , then the optimized potentials would have approximated that unique potential . like in the optimizations for the quantum number @xmath2 , the degeneracies would become the better the larger @xmath109 .",
    "this is clearly not what we have found in our calculations .",
    "instead , the optimized potentials strongly depend on @xmath109 and further we have not found any potential whose complete spectrum is degenerate according to the quantum number @xmath0 .",
    "by use of analytic methods as well as numerical calculations we have argued that there is no ` cluster problem ' analogous to the exactly solvable problems of the hydrogen atom and the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the sequence of quantum numbers @xmath1 and @xmath2 characterizing the latter systems thus can not be simply extended to quantum numbers @xmath0 . in this sense it seems that the quantum numbers @xmath1 and @xmath2 are unique .    in spite of this , the higher ` quantum numbers ' @xmath13 do have some meaning .",
    "the analysis of the energy levels _ near the fermi energy _ found in self - consistent jellium calculations reveals that the electronic shell and supershell structure mainly arises from an interplay of near degeneracies of the type @xmath0 _ and _ @xmath119.@xcite as has been pointed out by bohr and mottelson,@xcite such near degeneracies of energy levels corresponding to numbers @xmath13 are related to classical periodic orbits .",
    "for example , triangular orbits are connected with @xmath0-degeneracies , and square orbits with @xmath119 .",
    "this simple correspondence is however lost in a full semiclassical analysis . nevertheless for typical cluster potentials a periodic orbit expansion@xcite shows that the electronic shell and supershell structure is essentially captured by only considering the most important contributions which stem from the triangular and the square orbits . using the simple picture of bohr and mottelson this is consistent with the conjectured degeneracies as well as with those that can be found in jellium calculations .",
    "thus , the structures observed in the mass spectra of warmed metal clusters are intimately related with the quantities @xmath0 and @xmath119 .",
    "these numbers are , however , not analogous to the quantum numbers known from the exactly solvable models .",
