    "disorder is an unavoidable feature of many - body systems @xcite .",
    "since the properties of large disordered systems are difficult to study , tools have been developed to tackle them such as averaging over the disorder using sampling or perturbation theory , or using renormalisation group techniques .",
    "for example , strong disorder in @xmath1 spin chains can be investigated using renormalisation groups @xcite .",
    "entanglement is another important feature of many - body systems @xcite , one that has been shown to be a useful resource in many quantum information and computation schemes .",
    "it is therefore important to consider how entanglement in real , finite temperature systems is affected by disorder .    in the context of entanglement ,",
    "average disorder in spin chains has been studied previously @xcite .",
    "this research concentrated on using sampling , or on renormalisation groups at zero temperature . in @xcite , a perturbative technique to calculate a disorder averaged ( finite temperature ) entanglement witness",
    "was introduced . in this paper , the perturbative method is again used , and it",
    "is demonstrated how entanglement _ measures _ , rather than a witness , can be calculated .",
    "while both measures and witnesses are useful , considering entanglement measures allows any changes in the _ amount _ of entanglement by the disorder to be found .",
    "the disorder averaged concurrence along with other entanglement measures for weakly random systems are considered .",
    "a physical realisation of a spin chain is highly unlikely to be free from random variations of couplings or fields . due to difficulties in cooling a system to its ground state",
    ", it is also likely to be in a thermal , mixed state .",
    "spin chains have been shown to be good candidates for quantum wires , and thus have been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "the effects of a finite temperature @xcite have been considered , as have the effects of disorder at zero temperature @xcite , however the combined effects of disorder and finite temperature have not .",
    "this paper proposes how entanglement measures can be calculated for a random thermal spin chain .",
    "two distinct averages can be taken over the disorder : quenched or annealed @xcite .",
    "each is useful in differing situations , though the quenched average is often considered the appropriate one @xcite .",
    "the quenched average corresponds to the disorder effectively being time independent ; the disorder is not in equilibrium with the system , and while the system evolves , the disorder remains frozen .",
    "calculation - wise , this requires the thermal average to be taken before the average over the disorder , and thus we must average over the logarithm of the partition function .",
    "in contrast , the annealed average requires the average to be taken over the partition function itself . in this case",
    ", the disorder changes quickly , and is in equilibrium with the system as it evolves .",
    "thus we take the thermal average and disorder average at the same time .",
    "of course , the quenched and annealed averages are the two extremes ; disorder with aspects of both can exist .    many - body perturbation theory allows us to calculate disorder averaged correlation functions which are crucial for quantifying entanglement . as a consequence of the jordan - wigner transformation which transforms qubits into spinless fermions , we can use fermionic perturbation theory to study such spin systems @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we calculate thermal disorder averaged correlation functions and use them to find the disorder averaged concurrence .",
    "since the quenched or annealed average over disorder can be characterised by taking , respectively , an average over the logarithm of the partition function or over the partition function itself , we use the partition function as a starting point to calculate the disorder averaged concurrence .",
    "casting the partition function into functional ( or path ) integral form , introducing a generating functional term , and replicating it , we find we can take the average over the disorder , and later calculate a perturbative expansion of the disorder averaged correlation functions for both types of average @xcite .",
    "thus rather than calculating a direct average over the concurrence , we construct it from disorder averaged correlation functions .",
    "in particular , we consider an @xmath0 spin chain with a random term in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in addition to the disordered concurrence , we also discuss the results for the disordered single and two site entanglement entropy since by calculating the relevant disordered correlation functions for the concurrence , we already have all the necessary ingredients for the calculation .",
    "a number of entanglement measures exist , and each has advantages and disadvantages compared to the others . in this section ,",
    "we briefly discuss two different entanglement measures to demonstrate how perturbation theory could be used to consider disorder in each of them .",
    "the concurrence , @xcite quantifies entanglement between two mixed qubits ,    @xmath2    where @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath4 s are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a pauli spin matrix and @xmath7 is the complex conjugate of @xmath8 .",
    "concurrence has an advantage over other entanglement measures since is is relatively easy to calculate , and can be used for mixed states .",
    "thus it can be used to study thermal entanglement .",
    "however , concurrence is limited in that it can only be used between pairs of qubits .",
    "the entropy of entanglement @xcite measures the amount of entanglement in a pure state , @xmath9 .",
    "it is defined as the von neumann entropy of a reduced density matrix , @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "the entanglement entropy measures how mixed the subsystems , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , of a bipartite system are .",
    "although this is only a measure of entanglement for pure states since for mixed states it measures both quantum and classical correlations , it has the advantage that it can be used to calculate entanglement between any two parts of a system .",
    "since both of these entanglement measures use the density matrix @xmath8 which can be written in terms of correlation functions , we can use many - body perturbation theory to find a perturbative expansion of each . for the concurrence ,",
    "we only need two qubits , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , of a system :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is valid both for a thermal and a pure @xmath8 . for two - site entanglement entropy",
    ", we need @xmath18 .",
    "the density matrix is even simpler if we wish to consider single - site entanglement entropy , then @xmath19 .",
    "thus there are fewer correlation function averages to calculate .",
    "other entanglement measures such as the relative entropy of entanglement , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the closest separable state to @xmath8 , would be more difficult to calculate . in this case",
    ", we would need to find @xmath22 once the average had been taken .",
    "in the remainder of this paper , we concentrate on calculating the disorder averaged correlation functions necessary for finding the concurrence .",
    "we consider an example , the xx spin chain in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath23 , which means we can safely ignore boundary effects .",
    "this has hamiltonian    @xmath24    where j is the coupling strength between neighbouring spins and b is an external magnetic field .",
    "@xmath25 is the unperturbed part of the total hamiltonian , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the perturbation , and @xmath28 is a random variable .",
    "we could use any distribution for the random term , but we consider the case when @xmath29 is taken from a gaussian distribution centred at zero with variance @xmath30 and    @xmath31    we apply a jordan - wigner transformation , @xmath32 to the total hamiltonian to get    @xmath33    a fourier transform , @xmath34 diagonalises the unperturbed hamiltonian , leaving @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "although we applied the jordan - wigner transformation to @xmath37 , the fourier transform is not useful . in order to treat @xmath37",
    ", we turn to fermionic many - body perturbation theory using equation [ eq : hsecondq ] .",
    "the diagonal form of @xmath25 allows us to calculate useful quantities such as the partition function , @xmath38 $ ] ,    @xmath39 \\right\\}. \\label{eq : partfn0}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 is the temperature and we have set @xmath41 .",
    "as discussed previously , to take disorder into account when calculating concurrence , we must find the disorder average of each correlation function . for the xx spin chain many of the correlation functions are zero .",
    "the concurrence between sites @xmath14 and @xmath42 in terms of correlation functions is @xmath43 .",
    "thus for the disorder averaged concurrence , we need to calculate @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the bar indicates the average over the disorder while the brackets , @xmath47 denotes the thermal average .",
    "each of these expectation values can be calculated as a perturbative expansion in @xmath30 , the variance of the random distribution , using a functional integral technique . in this paper",
    ", we consider nearest and next nearest neighbour concurrence , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively , however , the method we discuss applies to any value of @xmath50 .",
    "the expectation values for the unperturbed @xmath0 chain were found in @xcite .",
    "we now outline how they are calculated for the unperturbed system before discussing how to find their perturbative expansion . using the jordan - wigner transformation ,",
    "the necessary correlation functions are @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "wick s theorem allows us to express n - point fermionic ( and bosonic ) correlation functions in terms of two - point correlation functions when @xmath25 is a non - interacting system .",
    "thus to calculate each of the above , we need only one quantity , @xmath54 , remembering the commutation relation , @xmath55 .    applying the fourier",
    "transform we used to diagonalise the unperturbed hamiltonian , we get    @xmath56    when @xmath57 , this is equal to the magnetisation of a single site , @xmath58",

    "since all the correlation functions can be written in terms of @xmath63 , it is sufficient to calculate @xmath64 .",

    "both have the effect of mixing energy levels allowing for the possibility of creating entanglement above the qcp .",

    "the blue lines are @xmath139 , the cyan lines @xmath150 , the purple lines @xmath151 and the orange lines @xmath152.,width=384 ]    a puzzling feature of these results is that disorder does not increase the concurrence above the qcp at zero temperature as we would expect following the reasoning in the argument above .",
    "we expect that we would need to calculate the perturbation series to a higher order to see this behaviour .",

    "however , we consider weak disorder while the lowest disorder @xcite calculates is an order of magnitude larger than ours .",
    "it is possible that calculating the perturbative expansion to higher order would allow us to observe this behaviour .",
    "and the short dashes @xmath149 .",
    "the blue lines are @xmath139 , the cyan lines @xmath150 , the purple lines @xmath151 and the orange lines @xmath152.,width=384 ]     and the short dashes @xmath149 .",
    "the blue lines are @xmath139 , the cyan lines @xmath150 , the purple lines @xmath151 and the orange lines @xmath152.,width=384 ]",
    "we have found that for weak disorder , concurrence , the entanglement between qubit pairs , in general decreases with increasing quenched disorder . at non - zero temperatures ,",
    "close to the qcp , disorder instead acts to increase entanglement . in the case of two - site entanglement entropy , ( remembering this is a measure of entanglement only at zero temperature ) , the entanglement between two sites and the remainder of the spin chain , increasing the disorder increases entanglement .",
    "our results demonstrate that disorder is not necessarily detrimental to entanglement and thus to schemes which use it as a resource .",
    "this is , however , dependent on which entanglement measure is appropriate and the parameter regime we consider .",
    "we can use the perturbation theory method to find the disorder averaged concurrence for other systems .",
    "however , if the system can not be expressed as a free fermion ( non - interacting ) model , the number of disorder averaged correlation functions required would be increased since wick s theorem could no longer be applied .",
    "for example , we would no longer have @xmath160 , and would instead need to calculate a four - point correlation function since @xmath161 .",
    "one strength of our paper is that we consider finite temperature as well as zero temperature entanglement .",
    "since we use perturbative methods , our work has the propensity to be extended in many directions .",
    "for example , higher order calculations and application of the dyson equation would be useful .",
    "in particular , perturbation theory allows for the consideration of time dependent non - equilibrium disorder averaged measures of entanglement using techniques such as the keldysh formalism .",
    "this would be interesting since it would show how disorder affects the finite temperature entanglement of a system as it evolves over time .",
