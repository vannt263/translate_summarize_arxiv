    "over the past a few years we have been developing a lattice gas model for the study of nuclear multifragmentation[1 - 5 ] . in this model @xmath3 nucleons",
    "are placed in @xmath4 cubes and they interact with nearest neighbour interactions . in most of this",
    "work the interaction between neutron - neutron , proton - proton and neutron - proton was taken to be identical although we have sometimes used[5 ] a more complicated model in which interactions between like particles are different from those between unlike particles .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to more fully expose this improved model and to examine its relationship with our earlier and simpler model . among other things",
    "we will also show that the important conclusions reached with our simpler model go through in our improved version .",
    "the lattice gas model has the attractive feature that it can provide an equation of state but it can also provide the cluster distribution . most of the observables are calculated using monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we used metropolis algorithm in our simulations .",
    "the @xmath3 particles are distributed in @xmath4 boxes according lattice gas hamiltonian and their momenta are generated from maxwell - boltzmann distribution at a prescribed temperature .",
    "calculation of clusters is straightforward .",
    "two nucleons in neighbouring cells are part of the same cluster if the relative kinetic energy is less than the strength of the attractive bond : @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the relative momentum , @xmath7 the reduced mass and @xmath8 is negative(attractive interaction ) .",
    "this prescription is sufficient to calculate cluster distribution .",
    "the motivation for introducing two kinds of bond is now obvious .",
    "if the neutron - neutron bond or the proton - proton bond is attractive then each numerical simulation can generate dineutrons and diprotons which in reality do not exist in nature as composites .",
    "one can get rid of these unphysical clusters by simply making the neutron - neutron and proton - proton bonds zero or repulsive .",
    "for completeness we mention some more features of the lattice gas model that were studied in [ 1,2 ] .",
    "one finds that at a certain temperature the distribution of composites is a power law : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number ( averaged over many simulations ) of composites with @xmath11 protons . as is a common practice",
    ", we will extract a value of @xmath1 even when the distribution has significantly deviated from a power law[6 ] .",
    "this value is extracted by using @xmath12 we also calculate the second moment @xmath13 where in the sum the largest cluster is excluded .",
    "the usefulness of @xmath2 was emphasized by campi[7 ] . since the lattice gas model has a hamiltonian , its average energy at any temperature can be calculated . the excitation energy and specific heat @xmath14 per particle can be calculated .",
    "we will find this useful too .",
    "we have @xmath4 boxes in the lattice in which we have to put @xmath15 neutrons and @xmath16 protons ; @xmath17 ; @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 are normal nuclear volume and density respectively . in principle",
    ", we can have three kinds of bonds : @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in the most general case where these interactions can take any arbitrary values a rich assortment of phenomena",
    "is predicted .",
    "the grand canonical partition function of this general lattice gas model can be mapped on to a spin 1 ising type model in the presence of a magnetic and quadrupole field .",
    "these have been studied in detail in the past[8 ] . for the nuclear case",
    "the values of the interactions are quite restricted and the richness of phenomena disappears .",
    "first of all we have to set @xmath23 and @xmath24 to be either zero or repulsive so that one avoids producing unphysical dineutron or diproton bound clusters . charge independence of nuclear forces suggests that we put @xmath25 . from now on we will write @xmath24 for both @xmath24 and @xmath23 . in our past work[5 ] and also in other modelings[9 ] of nuclear collisions using classical mechanics a slightly repulsive @xmath24 was used . to avoid proliferation of parameters",
    "we will set this bond to zero in this work .",
    "the binding energy of nuclear matter fixes the value of @xmath22 at -5.33 mev .    throughout this work @xmath26 stands for the number of nearest neighbours . in 3 dimensions",
    "one has @xmath27 .",
    "we use the bragg - williams mean field theory using the canonical ensemble .",
    "there are @xmath4 boxes and @xmath16 protons and @xmath15 neutrons .",
    "let one of the boxes be occupied by a proton .",
    "then , in the bragg - williams approximation , among its nearest neighbours , on the average @xmath28 will be occupied by protons and @xmath29 by neutrons .",
    "the number of @xmath30 bonds will be @xmath31 , the number of @xmath32 bonds will be @xmath33 where the factor of 1/2 remedies the double counting for proton - proton bonds . similarly starting with a box occupied by a neutron",
    "we come up with the same number of neutron - proton bonds and the number of neutron - neutron bonds is determined to be @xmath34 .",
    "thus the interaction energy when there are @xmath16 protons , @xmath15 neutrons placed in @xmath4 boxes is @xmath35 and the partition function is @xmath36 we now find pressure @xmath37 from the equation @xmath38_t$ ] and @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the volume of each box . using stirling s formula one arrives at @xmath41 introduce an asymmetry parameter @xmath42 which takes value 1 for neutron matter , 0 for nuclear matter and -1 for proton matter . we can then write @xmath43\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] determine the critical point from @xmath44 .",
    "this gives the critical density @xmath45 and the critical temperature to be @xmath46 $ ] . in this approximation with @xmath22 attractive and",
    "@xmath47 the critical temperature for nuclear matter ( which has @xmath48=0 ) would be highest at @xmath49 and would fall off quadratically with @xmath48 to 0 at neutron or proton matter .    the bragg - williams approximation is the simplest mean - field approximation . an improved treatment using bethe - peierls approximation",
    "is worked out in the appendix .",
    "the mean field calculation shown in this section and the appendix is merely to form a rough idea about the nature of phase transition . in practical calculations we need to obtain the yields of the composites at a given temperature .",
    "mean field theories do not provide these and we need to do event by event calculation which can be obtained through monte - carlo samplings .",
    "as far as we know exact results with two kinds of bonds are not available . for one kind of bond",
    "one can often interpret essentially exact although numerical results from well - studied spin 1/2 ising model for use in the lattice gas model . in the absence of such exact results",
    "our only recourse is to compare numerical results obtained with two kinds of bonds , i.e. , @xmath50 mev , @xmath47 with those obtained with one kind of bond that we have used before , i.e. , @xmath51 mev .",
    "we use here @xmath52 , which is a number appropriate for finite systems that we will investigate .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction the calculation proceeds by first putting the required number of protons and neutrons in the @xmath4 boxes using a standard metropolis algorithm .",
    "nucleons are then assigned momenta from monte - carlo sampling of a boltzmann distribution at the given temperature .",
    "the energy of the event can now be calculated .",
    "clusters are then determined as explained in the introduction .",
    "the results shown in figs . 1 and 2 are obtained by averaging over 1000 events for selected temperatures . for two assumed freeze - out densities",
    "we calculate the specific heat , the second moment @xmath2 and the deduced values of @xmath1 .",
    "the unit chosen in the graph for temperature is @xmath53 which is the @xmath54 for an infinitely large lattice with one kind of bond .",
    "we find that the peaking of @xmath55 and the minimum of @xmath1 happen at a slightly lower temperature ( about ten percent ) with two kinds of bond as compared to when the same bond is used for all the particles .",
    "for example for the minimum of @xmath1 to appear at the same temperature the value of @xmath56 has to be set at about 10% lower value than the value of @xmath22 when @xmath24 is set to zero .",
    "qualitatively and even semi - quantitatively the results in the two models look similar when this renormalisation of the strength is done .",
    "however , the peaking of @xmath14 is more pronounced in the two bonds model .",
    "all models which employ freeze - out densities assume that the freeze - out density is less than .5@xmath20 .",
    "if the freeze - out density is less than .5@xmath20 then in the lattice gas model a peak in the @xmath14 will signify the crossing of the co - existence curve and a first order phase transition .",
    "the value of specific heat can be deduced from the caloric curve [ 10 ] but locating the peak is very difficult in experiment . in a recent paper",
    "we have suggested[11 ] that since the peaking of @xmath14 is accompanied by a minimum in @xmath1 and a maximum in @xmath2 , the appearance of the last two could be taken as a signal of the phase transition .",
    "the appearance of the maxima in @xmath2 and of the minimum in @xmath1 in close vicinity of the maximum in @xmath14 happens in both the versions of the lattice gas model .",
    "here we follow the methods employed in ref [ 3 ] . at that time we studied the influence of the coulomb force on fragmentation of a system which had 85 nucleons and found the effects to be small . for a much larger system ( au on au : central collision so that the compound system has @xmath57 ) we found the effect to be very large .",
    "one of the rather unavoidable features of the lattice gas model is the appearance of a minimum in the extracted value of @xmath1 as a function of temperature .",
    "this feature disappeared for the very large system of @xmath58 because of the coulomb interaction .    for completeness a short description of a similar calculation but done for two kinds of bonds",
    "will be given here .",
    "in addition to lattice gas calculations , we do molecular dynamics calculations whose purpose is two - fold .",
    "one is to check if the predictions of a lattice gas model can resemble those of a molecular dynamics calculation provided the initial conditions are the same and the forces are chosen to be such that they resemble implied forces of the lattice gas model . for this",
    "we place the @xmath16 protons and @xmath15 neutrons in the n boxes using as usual metropolis algorithm .",
    "next we assign the momenta from monte - carlo sampling of a maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "once this is done the lattice gas model immediately gives the cluster distribution using the rule that two nucleons are part of the same cluster if @xmath5 . to calculate clusters using molecular dynamics we propagate the particles from this initial configuration for a long time under the influence of the chosen force",
    "( we will give the force parameters shortly ) . at asymptotic times",
    "the clusters are easily recognised ( a detailed discussion of cluster recognition which requires shorter computer times can be found in ref 12 ) .",
    "the cluster distribution in the two models can now be compared .",
    "3 shows the two prescriptions give nearly the same answer .",
    "we now come to the second and more important purpose of the molecular dynamics calculation .",
    "we now add the coulomb interaction to the nuclear part .",
    "the initialisation of putting the nucleons in @xmath4 boxes is done again but now with the inclusion of coulomb forces .",
    "we then do a molecular dynamics propagation including the coulomb force .",
    "the clusters can again be calculated and compared with the cases where the coulomb force was ignored .",
    "we now give the force parameters for molecular dynamics propagation .",
    "the neutron - proton potential was taken to be @xmath59\\exp ( [ 1/(r / r_0-a)])$ ] for @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath63 fm is the distance between the centers of two adjacent cubes .",
    "we have chosen @xmath64 and @xmath65 mev . with these parameters",
    "the potential is minimum at @xmath66 with the value -5.33 mev , is zero when the nucleons are more than @xmath67 apart and becomes strongly repulsive when @xmath68 is significantly less than @xmath66 .",
    "we now turn to the nuclear part of like particle interactions .",
    "although we take @xmath69 in lattice gas calculations the fact that we do not put two like particles in the same cube would suggest that there is short range repulsion between them .",
    "we have taken the nuclear force between two like particles to be the same expression as above plus 5.33 mev upto @xmath70 and zero afterwards : @xmath71 for @xmath72 and 0 afterwards .",
    "this means there is a repulsive core which goes to zero at @xmath66 and is zero afterwards .",
    "the results shown in figs . 3 and 4 can be summarised as follows .",
    "first of all shows that if there is no coulomb interaction then lattice gas model results are quite close to that of molecular dynamics simulation provided in the latter one starts from the same initial condition and uses a force suitably chosen .",
    "fig 3 also shows that in the case of @xmath73 the coulomb force does not have a large effect .",
    "the minimum in @xmath1 and the maximum in @xmath2 are shifted to slightly lower temperature .",
    "the effect for @xmath74 is much bigger .",
    "the minimum in @xmath1 and the maximum in @xmath2 are shifted from 4.8 mev ( lattice gas without coulomb ) to about 2.4 mev .",
    "our previous calculation showed that there is no minimum in @xmath1 for @xmath75 .",
    "so somewhere between these two limits the minimum will vanish .",
    "the two bond model is a natural progression of the simpler lattice gas model . in this paper",
    "we have done calculations with the two bond model .",
    "although in detail the two models differ the major characteristics of the well studied simple model remain unchanged .",
    "the lattice gas model remains a quick tool to calculate experimental data .",
    "when the coulomb force is very strong the lattice gas model can not be relied upon .",
    "figs . 3 and 4 give some indication of the reliability of the model in the presence of a coulomb force .",
    "calculations above indicate that a viable ( although much more time consuming ) prescription might be : obtain the initial conditions as in a lattice gas model . put @xmath3 nucleons in @xmath4 boxes by metropolis sampling where one includes in addition to lattice gas hamiltonian the coulomb force .",
    "obtain momenta of each nucleon from a monte - carlo sampling of a maxwell - boltzmann distribution . then propagate by molecular dynamics to obtain cluster distributions .",
    "techniques developed in ref .",
    "12 might be useful so that one does not need to run molecular dynamics till asymptotic times .",
    "one attractive feature of this hybrid model is that the coulomb force is operative even during the formation of clusters as opposed to other models where the coulomb force only adds repulsion between the composites already formed .",
    "this work is supported in part by the natural sciences and engineering council of canada and by le fonds pour la formation de chercheurs et laide  la recherche du qubec .",
    "we like to thank w. f. j. mller for informing us about reference 8 .",
    "we follow the method of reference 1 .",
    "we break up the lattices into @xmath76 blocks , each of which contains 1 central box and @xmath26 nearest neighbours to it .",
    "we refer to fig a.1 where for simplicity a two - dimensional lattice is shown .",
    "the interactions within each block are taken into account exactly while the interactions between different blocks are treated in an approximate fashion .",
    "the grand partition function can be written as the product of the grand partition functions of the @xmath77 blocks : @xmath78 we want to write down the grand partition function of the block denoted by 1,2,3,@xmath26 and 5 . in the general case there will be two absolute fugacities @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the first referring to protons and the second to neutrons .",
    "the grand partition function for a block can be written as @xmath81 where @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 here @xmath85=contribution to the partition function when the central ( innermost ) site is empty , @xmath86=contribution to the partition function when the central site has a proton and @xmath87=contribution to the partition function when the central site has a neutron .",
    "equation ( 4 ) takes the place of eq.(3.9 ) in ref [ 1 ] .",
    "the two constants @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the average interaction energy with the adjacent block when a proton ( neutron ) occupies a peripheral site .",
    "the probability that the central site is occupied by a proton is @xmath90 .",
    "thus we have @xmath91 but since no particular site is favoured over another one , the average occupation occupation of one of the peripheral sites must also be @xmath90 .",
    "this gives @xmath92 where @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 similarly two equations can be written for @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath97 @xmath98 where @xmath99 can be written down from expressions @xmath100 by interchanging protons with neutrons .      for @xmath102 , the calculations simplify .",
    "now we have @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "then @xmath105 ( eqs(8 ) and ( 9 ) ) leads to @xmath106 where we have defined @xmath107 . dividing both sides of eqn ( 15 ) by @xmath108 we obtain @xmath109 rewrite eq.(8 ) as @xmath110 where @xmath111 to obtain @xmath112 using eq(15 ) the above relation leads to @xmath113 define @xmath114 .",
    "going back to eq(17 ) one can now derive a simple solution for @xmath115 : @xmath116\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] values of @xmath117 and @xmath118 from the definition of @xmath115 and eq.(18 ) .",
    "let us now go back to the partition function for the lattice as given by eq.(3 ) . where it is written as a product of the partition functions of the @xmath77 blocks .",
    "if we simply @xmath119 for each little block as calculated above we will count twice the interaction between neighbouring sites in different blocks .",
    "for example , the binding energy between 1 and 6 ( fig .",
    "a.1 ) is included in @xmath119(block 1 ) and it is included again in @xmath119(block 2 ) .",
    "we note that on the average there are @xmath120 particles at each site and each block has @xmath26 peripheral sites .",
    "thus when we evaluate the partition function for the lattice , the partition function for each block should be corrected by the multiplicative factor @xmath121 we can now use @xmath122 , and @xmath123 to obtain @xmath124 where @xmath119 includes the correction factor .    in fig .",
    "a2 we have drawn @xmath125 diagrams for nuclear matter for two cases : ( 1 ) @xmath126 mev and ( 2)@xmath50 mev and @xmath69 mev . in bethe - peierls approximation",
    "the @xmath54 in the former case appears to be between 6 and 8 mev and in the second case between 4 and 6 mev .",
