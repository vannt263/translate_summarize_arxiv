    "modelling the dynamic evolution of nuclear collisions in terms of fluid dynamics has a long - standing tradition in heavy - ion physics , for a review see @xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons is that one essentially does not need more information to solve the equations of motion of ideal fluid dynamics than the equilibrium equation of state of matter under consideration .",
    "once the equation of state is known ( and an initial condition is specified ) , the equations of motion uniquely determine the dynamics of the collision .",
    "knowledge about microscopic reaction processes is not required .",
    "this becomes especially important when one wants to study the transition from hadron to quark and gluon degrees of freedom , as predicted by lattice simulations of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite .",
    "the complicated deconfinement or hadronization processes need not be known in microscopic detail , all that is necessary is the thermodynamic equation of state as computed by e.g.  lattice qcd .",
    "this fact has renewed interest in fluid dynamics to study the effects of the deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration transition on the dynamics of relativistic nuclear collisions .",
    "such collisions are presently under intense experimental investigation at cern s sps and brookhaven national laboratory s ags and ( beginning fall 1999 ) rhic accelerators .    in this set of lectures",
    "i give an overview over the basic concepts and notions of relativistic fluid dynamics as applied to the physics of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the aim is not to present a detailed and complete review of this field , but to provide a foundation to understand the literature on current research activities in this field .",
    "this has the consequence that the list of references is far from complete , that i will not make any attempt to compare to actual experimental data , and that some interesting , but more applied topics ( such as transverse collective flow ) will not be discussed here . in section 2 ,",
    "i discuss the basic concepts of relativistic fluid dynamics .",
    "first , i present a derivation of the fluid - dynamical equations of motion . a priori",
    ", there are more unknown functions than there are equations , and one has to devise approximation schemes in order to close the set of equations of motion .",
    "the most simple is the ideal fluid approximation , which simply discards some of the unknown functions .",
    "another one is the assumption of small deviations from local thermodynamical equilibrium , which leads to the equations of dissipative fluid dynamics .",
    "a brief discussion of multi - fluid models concludes this section . in section 3",
    "i discuss numerical aspects of solution schemes for ideal relativistic fluid dynamics .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a discussion of one - dimensional solutions of ideal fluid dynamics . after presenting a classification of possible wave patterns in one spatial dimension , for both thermodynamicall normal as well as anomalous matter",
    ", i discuss the expansion of semi - infinite matter into vacuum .",
    "this naturally leads to the discussion of the landau model for the one - dimensional expansion of a finite slab of matter .",
    "the landau model is historically the first fluid - dynamical model for relativistic nuclear collisions .",
    "however , more realistic is , at least for ultrarelativistic collision energies , the so - called the bjorken model which is subsequently presented .",
    "the main result of this section is the time delay in the expansion of the system due to the softening of the equation of state in a phase transition region .",
    "this may have potential experimental consequences for nuclear collisions at rhic energies , where one wants to study the transition from hadron to quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "finally , section 5 concludes this set of lectures with a discussion on how to decouple particles from the fluid evolution in the so - called `` freeze - out '' process and compute experimentally observable quantities like single inclusive particle spectra .",
    "units are @xmath0 .",
    "the metric tensor is @xmath1 .",
    "upper greek indices are contravariant , lower greek indices covariant . the scalar product of two 4-vectors @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "the latter notation is also used for the scalar product of two 3-vectors @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "in this section , i first derive the conservation equations of relativistic fluid dynamics . if there are @xmath6 conserved charges in the fluid , there are @xmath7 conservation equations : 1 for the conservation of energy , 3 for the conservation of 3-momentum , and @xmath6 for the conservation of the respective charges . in the general case , however , there are @xmath8 independent variables : the 10 independent components of the energy - momentum tensor ( which is a symmetric tensor of rank 2 ) , and the 4 independent components of the 4-vectors of the @xmath6 charge currents .",
    "thus , the system of fluid - dynamical equations is not closed , and one requires an approximation in order to solve it .",
    "the simplest approximation is the ideal fluid assumption which reduces the number of unknown functions to @xmath9 .",
    "the equation of state of the fluid then provides the final equation to close the system of conservation equations and to solve it uniquely .",
    "another approximation is the assumption of small deviations from an ideal fluid and leads to the equations of dissipative fluid dynamics . in this approximation one",
    "provides an additional set of @xmath10 equations to close the set of equations of motion .",
    "finally , i also briefly discuss multi - fluid - dynamical models .",
    "fluid dynamics is equivalent to the conservation of energy , momentum , and net charge number .",
    "consider a single fluid characterized locally in space - time by its energy - momentum tensor @xmath11 and by the @xmath6 conserved net charge currents @xmath12 .",
    "( conserved charges are for example the electric charge , baryon number , strangeness , charm , etc . ) consider now an arbitrary hypersurface @xmath13 in 4-dimensional space - time .",
    "the tangent 4-vector on this surface is @xmath14 . the normal vector on a surface element @xmath15 of @xmath13 is denoted by @xmath16 . by definition , @xmath17 .",
    "the amount of net charge of type @xmath18 and of energy and momentum flowing through the surface element @xmath15 is given by @xmath19 now consider an arbitrary space - time volume @xmath20 with a _ closed _",
    "surface @xmath13 .",
    "if there are neither sources nor sinks of net charge and energy - momentum inside @xmath13 , one has @xmath21 gauss theorem then leads immediately to the _ global conservation of net charge and energy - momentum _ : @xmath22 for arbitrary @xmath20 , however , one has to require that the integrands in ( [ ris : globalcons1],[ris : globalcons2 ] ) vanish , which leads to _ local conservation of net charge and energy - momentum _ : @xmath23 these are the equations of motion of relativistic fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "note that there are @xmath7 equations , but @xmath24 independent unknown functions @xmath25 .",
    "( @xmath26 is a symmetric tensor of rank 2 and therefore has 10 independent components , the @xmath27 are 4-vectors with 4 independent components . ) therefore , the system of fluid - dynamical equations is a priori not closed and can not be solved in complete generality .",
    "one requires additional assumptions to close the set of equations .",
    "one possibility is to reduce the number of unknown functions , another is to provide @xmath28 additional equations of motion which determine all unknown functions uniquely .",
    "both possibilities will be discussed in the following subsections .      before discussing approximations to close the system of conservation equations , it is convenient to perform a tensor decomposition of @xmath29 with respect to an _ arbitrary , time - like , normalized",
    "_ 4-vector @xmath30 , @xmath31 . the projector onto the 3-space orthogonal to @xmath30 is denoted by @xmath32 then the tensor decomposition reads : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the _ net density _ of charge of type @xmath18 in the frame where @xmath35 ( subsequently denoted as the _ local rest frame _ , lrf ) , @xmath36 is the _ net flow _ of charge of type @xmath18 in the lrf , @xmath37 is the _ energy density _ in the lrf , @xmath38 is the _ isotropic pressure _ in the lrf , @xmath39 is the _ flow of energy _ or _ heat flow _ in the lrf , and @xmath40\\ , t^{\\alpha \\beta } \\label{ris : stresstens}\\ ] ] is the _ stress tensor _ in the lrf .",
    "note that the particular projection ( [ ris : stresstens ] ) is _ trace - free_. ( the trace of the projection @xmath41 is absorbed in the definition of @xmath42 . ) the tensor decomposition replaces the original @xmath24 unknown functions by an equal number of new unknown functions @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( 5 ) .",
    "so far , @xmath30 is arbitrary .",
    "however , one can give it a physical meaning by choosing it either to be @xmath47 or ( which is an implicit definition )",
    "@xmath48 the first choice means that @xmath49 is the physical 4-velocity of the _ flow _ of net charge @xmath18 .",
    "the lrf is then the _ local rest frame of the flow of net charge _",
    "@xmath18 , i.e. , the frame where @xmath50 . in this frame",
    ", there is obviously no flow of charge @xmath18 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "this lrf is called _",
    "eckart frame_. note , however , that not all net charges need to flow with the same velocity , @xmath53 might be @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "the number of unknown functions is still @xmath24 , since the 3 previously unknown functions @xmath56 have been merely replaced by the 3 independent components of @xmath49 ( @xmath57 ! ) , which now have to be determined dynamically from the conservation equation for @xmath58 .",
    "the second choice means that @xmath59 is the physical 4-velocity of the _ energy flow_. the lrf is the _ local rest frame of the energy flow_. it is obvious that in this frame @xmath60 .",

    "the chemical potential of the particles is defined as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 are the chemical potentials which control the net number of charge of type @xmath18 , and @xmath71 is the individual charge of type @xmath18 carried by a particle .",
    "the chemical potential for antiparticles is @xmath72 ( in thermodynamical equilibrium ) .",

    "the form ( [ ris : ni],[ris : tmunu ] ) implies that for an ideal gas in local thermodynamical equilibrium the functions @xmath83 , i.e. , there is no flow of charge or heat with respect to the particle flow velocity @xmath30 , and there are no stress forces .",
    "this implies furthermore ( and can be confirmed by an explicit calculation ) that for an ideal gas in local thermodynamical equilibrium @xmath84 , i.e. , eckart s and landau s choice of frame coincide with the local rest frame of particle flow .",
    "this consideration of an ideal gas in local thermodynamical equilibrium serves as a motivation for the so - called _ ideal fluid approximation_. in this approximation , one starts on the _ macroscopic _ level of fluid variables @xmath85 and _ a priori _ takes them to be of the form ( [ ris : ni ] ) and ( [ ris : tmunu ] ) .",
    "the corresponding fluid is referred to as an _",
    "ideal fluid_. without any further assumption , however , the corresponding system of @xmath7 equations of motion contains @xmath9 unknown functions , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "one therefore has to specify an _ equation of state _ for the fluid , for instance ( and most commonly taken ) of the form @xmath88 .",
    "this closes the system of equations of motion .",
    "the equation of state is the _ only _ place where information enters about the nature of the particles in the fluid and the _ microscopic _ interactions between them .",
    "usually , the equation of state for the fluid is taken to be the _ thermodynamic _ equation of state , as computed for a system in _",
    "thermodynamical equilibrium_. the process of closing the system of equations of motions by assuming a thermodynamic equation of state therefore involves the _ implicit assumption _ that the _ fluid is in local thermodynamical equilibrium_. it is important to note , however , that the _ explicit form _ of the equation of state is _ completely unrestricted _ ,",
    "for instance it can have anomalies like phase transitions .",
    "the ideal fluid approximation therefore allows to consider a wider class of systems than just an ideal gas in local thermodynamical equilibrium , which served as a motivation for this approximation .",
    "an ideal gas has a very specific equation of state without any anomalies and is given by ( [ ris : idgaspress ] ) which defines @xmath89 ( which in turn allows to determine all other thermodynamic functions from the first law and the fundamental relation of thermodynamics , and thus to specify @xmath88 , see the following remarks ) .",
    "i close this subsection with three remarks .",
    "the first concerns the notion of an equation of state which is _ complete _ in the thermodynamic sense .",
    "such an equation of state allows ( by definition ) to determine , for given values of the independent thermodynamic variables , all other thermodynamic functions from the first law of thermodynamics ( or one of its legendre transforms ) @xmath90 @xmath91 being the entropy density , and from the fundamental relation of thermodynamics @xmath92 obviously , for independent thermodynamic variables @xmath93 , an equation of state of the form @xmath94 is complete in this sense , since partial differentiation of this function yields , from ( [ ris:1stlaw ] ) , the functions @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "then , the fundamental relation ( [ ris : fundamental ] ) yields the last unknown thermodynamic function , @xmath42 .",
    "another example of a complete equation of state is @xmath89 , since the ( multiple ) legendre transform of ( [ ris:1stlaw ] ) reads @xmath99 ( which is also known as the gibbs ",
    "duhem relation ) , such that the thermodynamic functions @xmath100 can be determined from partial differentiation of @xmath42 .",
    "the last unknown thermodynamic function , @xmath101 , can then be determined from ( [ ris : fundamental ] ) .",
    "the equation of state @xmath102 is , however , _ not a complete _ equation of state in the thermodynamic sense .",
    "partial differentiation of this function yields thermodynamic functions @xmath103 , which in general do _ not allow _ to infer the values of @xmath104 and @xmath70 , @xmath105 .",
    "the second remark concerns the assumption of local thermodynamical equilibrium . in order to achieve local thermodynamical equilibrium , spatio - temporal variations of the macroscopic fluid fields",
    "have to be small compared to microscopic reaction rates which drive the system ( locally ) towards thermodynamical equilibrium . a quantity that characterizes spatio - temporal variations of the macroscopic fields",
    "is the so - called _ expansion scalar _ @xmath106 .",
    "it determines the ( local ) rate of expansion of the fluid .",
    "microscopic reaction rates are essentially given by the product of cross section and local particle density , @xmath107 .",
    "the criterion for local thermodynamical equilibrium then reads @xmath108    the third remark concerns entropy production . in ideal fluid dynamics",
    ", the entropy current is defined as @xmath109 taking the projection of energy - momentum conservation in the direction of @xmath110 one derives @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a comoving time derivative and where use has been made of the fact that @xmath30 is normalized , i.e. , @xmath113 . with the first law of thermodynamics ( [ ris:1stlaw ] ) and",
    "the fundamental relation of thermodynamics ( [ ris : fundamental ] ) one rewrites this as @xmath114 finally , employing net charge conservation @xmath115 yields @xmath116 i.e. , the entropy current is conserved in ideal fluid dynamics . as we shall see in one of the following section ,",
    "however , this proof only holds where the partial derivatives in these equations are well - defined , i.e. , for continuous solutions of ideal fluid dynamics .",
    "discontinuous solutions will in fact be shown to produce entropy .",
    "in dissipative fluid dynamics one does not set @xmath117 a priori to zero , but specifies them through additional equations .",
    "there are two ways to obtain the latter .",
    "the first is phenomenological and starts from the second law of thermodynamics , i.e. , the principle of non - decreasing entropy , @xmath118 the second way resorts to kinetic theory to derive the respective equations . in principle , both ways require the additional assumption that deviations from local thermodynamical equilibrium are small . to make this statement more concise ,",
    "let us introduce the _ equilibrium pressure _ @xmath119 , i.e. , it is the pressure as computed from the equation of state for given values of @xmath120 . in a general non - equilibrium ( dissipative )",
    "situation , however , @xmath121 is different from the isotropic pressure @xmath42 defined through ( [ ris : isotropicpress ] ) .",
    "denote the difference by @xmath122 .",
    "then , the requirement that deviations from local thermodynamical equilibrium are small is equivalent to requiring @xmath123 , and @xmath124 to be small compared to @xmath125 , and @xmath126 .",
    "i first outline the phenomenological approach to derive the equations of dissipative fluid dynamics . for",
    "the sake of definiteness , in the remainder of this subsection let us consider a system of one particle species only and let us assume that the total _",
    "particle number _ of this species is conserved ( implying that no annihilation or creation processes take place , i.e. , we do not consider the corresponding antiparticles ) .",
    "the particle number current then replaces the net charge current .",
    "we shall also work in the eckart frame , where @xmath127 .",
    "let us make an ansatz for the entropy 4-current @xmath128 . in the limit of vanishing @xmath129 , and @xmath124 , the entropy 4-current should reduce to the one of ideal fluid dynamics , @xmath130 .",
    "the only non - vanishing 4-vector which can be formed from the available tensors @xmath131 and @xmath46 is @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is an arbitrary coefficient ( remember @xmath134 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath135 with this ansatz one computes with the help of @xmath136 and @xmath137 : @xmath138 the simplest way to ensure this inequality is to choose @xmath139\\ , \\partial^\\alpha u^\\beta \\enspace,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath140 , and @xmath141 are the ( positive ) _ bulk viscosity , shear viscosity _ and _ thermal conductivity _ coefficients .",
    "note that these equations define the dissipative corrections as _ algebraic _ functions of gradients of the flow velocity @xmath30 and the equilibrium temperature @xmath142 . with these choices ,",
    "@xmath143 which is obviously larger or equal to zero ( remember that @xmath144 , which can be most easily proven from @xmath145 in the frame where @xmath35 ) . while this ensures the second law of thermodynamics , it was shown @xcite that the resulting equations of motion are _ unstable _ under perturbations and support _ acausal _ ,",
    "i.e. , _ superluminous _ propagation of information .",
    "they are therefore not suitable as candidates for a _ relativistic _ theory of dissipative fluid dynamics .",
    "a solution to this dilemma was presented by mller @xcite , and israel and stewart @xcite .",
    "they observed that the ansatz ( [ ris : ansatz1 ] ) for the entropy current should not only contain first order terms in the dissipative corrections , but also second order terms : @xmath146 where @xmath147 is second order in the dissipative quantities @xmath148 and @xmath46 .",
    "inserting this into @xmath149 leads to _ differential equations _ for @xmath150 , and @xmath46 which involve the coefficients @xmath151 .",
    "it can be shown that , for reasonable values of these coefficents , the resulting 14 equations of motion ( the 9 equations that determine @xmath152 , and @xmath46 and the 5 conservation equations for @xmath153 ) are stable and causal .    in the phenomenological approach ,",
    "the values of these coefficients are not determined . in the second approach , however , based on kinetic theory , they can be explicitly computed along with deriving the additional 9 equations of motion for @xmath154 and @xmath46 .",
    "this will be outlined in the following .",
    "let us start by writing the single - particle phase space distribution in local equilibrium ( [ ris : feq ] ) as @xmath155^{-1 } \\enspace , \\ ] ] where @xmath156/t(x)$ ] .",
    "now assume that the _ non - equilibrium _ phase space distribution , written in the form @xmath157^{-1 } \\enspace , \\ ] ] deviates only slightly from the equilibrium distribution function @xmath158 , or in other words : @xmath159 where @xmath160 , and @xmath161 are small compared to @xmath162",

    "however , its trace can be absorbed in a redefinition of the first variable @xmath167 , therefore it actually has only 9 independent components . )    inserting @xmath163 into the kinetic theory definition of @xmath168 and @xmath63 , ( [ ris : nmukin ] ) and ( [ ris : tmunukin ] ) , ( with @xmath169 replaced by @xmath170 and , since we do not consider antiparticles , discarding @xmath171 ) , one can establish relations between the 14 unknown _ macroscopic _ functions ( in the eckart frame ) @xmath172 and the 14 variables @xmath173 .",
    "this uniquely determines the non - equilibrium single - particle phase space distribution @xmath163 in terms of the macroscopic , i.e. , fluid - dynamical variables .",
    "this identification involves one subtlety : as in ideal fluid dynamics one still has to know the value of the ( equilibrium ) pressure @xmath121 to determine all unknown quantities . the equilibrium pressure",
    "@xmath121 is , however , only known as a function of the _ equilibrium _ energy density @xmath174 and the _ equilibrium _ particle number density @xmath175 , but not as function of the actual energy density @xmath101 and particle number density @xmath6 .",
    "two additional assumptions are required , namely that @xmath176 where @xmath177 and @xmath178 are the ( kinetic ) energy - momentum tensor and particle number current computed with the _ equilibrium _ phase space distribution @xmath158 .",
    "then @xmath179 and the value of the equilibrium pressure @xmath121 is also determined .",
    "on close inspection , these additional assumptions do not pose any further restriction on the set of 14 unknown functions , but merely serve as definitions of ( equilibrium ) temperature @xmath142 and chemical potential @xmath180 corresponding to a given energy density @xmath101 and particle number density @xmath6 . another way to say",
    "this is that the assumptions ( [ ris : ass1 ] ) , ( [ ris : ass2 ] ) determine a local equilibrium phase space distribution @xmath158 .",

    "it is also assumed that the equation of state has the simple ultrarelativistic form @xmath381 , @xmath394 , i.e. , that matter is thermodynamically normal for all @xmath101 .",
    "( the original idea of landau actually was that the baryons are immediately stopped in the collision through compressional shock waves .",
    "data from heavy - ion experiments at bnl - ags and cern - sps prove that this picture is unrealistic , due to the aforementioned finite stopping power of nuclear matter . however , since the collision is ultrarelativistic , the thermal energy in the highly excited slab is much larger than the chemical energy associated with the conservation of baryon charge .",
    "therefore , to good approximation , @xmath395 , and the further evolution of the slab will be identical to what is discussed here . )    for @xmath266 , the slab starts to expand . as in the expansion of semi - infinite matter discussed in the previous subsection , rarefaction waves will form .",
    "for thermodynamically normal matter , these are continuous ( riemann ) rarefaction waves which travel into the slab with sound velocity .",
    "therefore , they will meet at the center of the slab ( here chosen to be the origin @xmath396 ) at a time @xmath397 . for times",
    "@xmath398 , these waves overlap and the solution becomes more complicated . in a region near the light cone ,",
    "the solution will remain a riemann rarefaction wave , therefore we term this region the _ riemann region_. in the center where the riemann rarefaction waves overlap , however , the solution is no longer a simple wave ( indeed , only two regions of constant flow _ have _ to be connected by a simple wave @xcite , for two simple waves no such theorem exists ) . for @xmath394",
    "the solution can still be given in closed analytic form @xcite , although the derivation is rather complicated .",

    "[ ris : fig12 ] ( c ) .",

    "[ ris : fig12 ] ( f ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the general argument presented earlier that the softening of the equation of state in the mixed phase region leads to a reduced expansion tendency and thus to a `` stalled '' expansion of the system .",
    "the softening of the equation of state is also the reason why the expansion for the @xmath404 equation of state , fig .",

    "there is no scale in the problem at all . in this case",

    "the consequences of this special form for the longitudinal fluid velocity were first investigated in @xcite , again with respect to possible applications in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "bjorken @xcite was the first to discuss it in the framework of nuclear collisions .",

    "[ ris : fig13 ] . as in the landau model ,",
    "two ultrarelativistic , lorentz - contracted nuclei collide at @xmath396 and @xmath263 ( the moment of complete overlap ) in the center of mass frame of the collision . due to the limited amount of nuclear stopping power , the baryon charges keep on moving along the light cone , while microscopic collision processes ( the nature of which is of no concern for the following ) lead to the formation of a region of highly excited , net charge free matter in the wake of the nuclei .",
    "in contrast to the landau model , however , the collective velocity in this region is of the scaling form @xmath406 .",
    "the region of highly excited matter is supposed to rapidly equilibrate locally within a time span @xmath407 ( which is of the order of a fm or less ) , and the further evolution of the system can be described in terms of ideal fluid dynamics .",

    "an obvious candidate is the ratio of the `` out '' to the `` side '' radius of two - particle correlation functions .",
    "the `` out '' radius is proportional to the duration of particle emission from a source , while the `` side '' radius is proportional to the transverse dimension of the source ( cf.@xcite for a very detailed , pedagogical discussion ) . since the transverse radius of the source is approximately the same in all cases , cf .",

    "however , as we have seen above , at all times near the boundary to the vacuum , as well as everywhere in the late stage of the evolution , the energy density becomes arbitrarily small , i.e. , the system is rather cold and dilute . in this space - time region",
    "the assumption of local thermodynamical equilibrium is no longer justified , because the particle scattering cross section @xmath467 is finite , such that for small particle densities @xmath6 the particle scattering rate , @xmath468 , becomes on the order of the inverse system size , @xmath469 . at this point ,",
    "the scattering rate is too small to maintain local thermodynamical equilibrium and the particles decouple from the fluid evolution . in this space - time region ,",
    "a kinetic description for the particle motion would be more appropriate .",
    "one should therefore not solve fluid - dynamical equations in the whole forward lightcone , but only inside a space - time region of sufficiently large energy and particle densities , while outside this region , the particle motion should be described by kinetic theory , fig .",
    "[ ris : fig17 ] ( b ) .",
    "the boundary @xmath13 between the two regions is determined by a criterion which compares local scattering rates with the system size , as discussed above .",
    "the obvious difficulty with this more realistic description of the system s evolution is that this boundary has to be determined _ dynamically _ , i.e. , not only has one to allow for particles decoupling from the fluid , but also for the reverse process of particles entering the fluid from the kinetic region .",
    "( this can happen since the particles still , albeit rarely , collide in the kinetic region . )",
    "a consistent treatment of this problem is rather complicated , since one has to solve kinetic in addition to the fluid - dynamical equations .",
    "no serious attempt has been made so far .      1 .",
    "one assumes that fluid dynamics gives a reasonable description for the evolution of the system in the _ whole _ forward lightcone .",
    "2 .   one determines the `` decoupling '' surface @xmath13 _ a posteriori _ , once the evolution of the fluid is known .",
    "the `` thickness '' of @xmath13 is assumed to be infinitesimal .",
    "one assumes that particles crossing @xmath13 have _ completely _ decoupled from the system , they stream freely towards the detectors without any further collisional interaction ( `` freeze - out '' ) .",
    "this means that they do not change their momentum and energy once they have crossed @xmath13 .",
    "a very popular argument in order to determine @xmath13 is the following . since @xmath470 , the scattering rate @xmath471 ( for constant cross section @xmath467 ) , i.e.",
    ", if the temperature falls below a certain so - called `` freeze - out '' temperature @xmath458 , the criterion @xmath472 is fulfilled , and particles decouple from the system . in this case , @xmath13 is just given by the isotherm @xmath473 ( use of this argument was already made above in the discussion of the `` lifetime '' of the system ) .",
    "note that assumption 3 .  is a strong idealization and actually rather questionable , because in reality @xmath13 is a space - time region of finite thickness , inside which non - equilibrium , dissipative effects become gradually more and more important ( the more dilute the fluid becomes ) , until ultimately all interactions between particles cease and , when leaving @xmath13 , they stream freely towards the detectors .    nevertheless , with the above assumptions , one can readily compute the single inclusive spectra of particles reaching the detector . immediately before the particles decouple from the fluid evolution , i.e. , before they cross @xmath13 , they are still in local thermodynamical equilibrium such that their phase space distribution is given by @xmath158 , eq .",
    "( [ ris : feq ] ) .",

    "therefore , the phase space distribution of `` frozen - out '' particles is ( approximately ) the same as in local equilibrium . the total number of particles crossing a small surface element @xmath15 of @xmath13 is then given by @xmath474 @xmath168 being the ( kinetic ) particle number 4-current .",

    "there is , however , a problem with this formula @xcite . for _ time - like _ surfaces , i.e. , where the normal vector @xmath477 is _ space - like _ , @xmath478 may either be positive or negative , depending on the value and direction of @xmath479 .",
    "in other words , the number of particles `` freezing out '' from a certain time - like surface element @xmath15 can become negative . this is clearly unphysical , since the number of particles decoupling from the system must be positive definite . for _",
    "space - like _ surfaces ( with a _ time - like _ normal vector ) as well as for time - like surface elements where @xmath480 , the cooper - frye formula gives a physically reasonable , positive definite result for the number of frozen - out particles .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ris : fig18 ] which shows the rapidity distribution of particles ( i.e. , the invariant momentum spectrum integrated over all transverse momenta ) for massless particles decoupling from a freeze - out isotherm @xmath481 in the landau model with a @xmath482 equation of state .",
    "one clearly notices the negative particle numbers at midrapidity coming from the time - like parts of the isotherm .",
    "this contradiction is readily resolved noting that the cooper - frye formula does not really determine the number of particles decoupling from the system , but merely the number of particle _ worldlines crossing a surface element _ @xmath15 ( and then integrated over the whole surface @xmath13 ) . for time - like surface elements",
    ", there is of course the possibility that for certain @xmath479 the respective worldlines cross @xmath15 in the `` wrong '' direction , i.e. , the momenta of the particles point back into the region of fluid , cf.fig .  [ ris : fig19 ] . in particular , for the @xmath481 isotherm , which moves _ away _ from the @xmath304-axis in the @xmath403 plane , those are particles with vanishing momentum component in @xmath239 direction , because their worldlines are parallel to the @xmath304-axis . particles with @xmath483 , however , also have vanishing longitudinal rapidity @xmath484 , and that is the reason why these negative particle numbers appear at midrapidity in fig .",
    "[ ris : fig18 ] .",
    "while this explains the negative contributions in the cooper - frye formula , it also invalidates this formula as the correct prescription to calculate the spectra of frozen - out particles , if parts of the decoupling surface are time - like .    one suggestion to circumvent this problem was to compute the final spectra only from contribution of particles which cross the space - like parts of @xmath13",
    ". of course ,",
    "as can be seen by comparing the dash - dotted with the solid line in fig .",
    "[ ris : fig18 ] , the final spectra are dramatically different .",
    "moreover , by neglecting particles crossing the time - like parts , the absolute number of frozen - out particles will also differ in the two cases .",
    "note that the @xmath485 distribution for particles from the space - like parts of the decoupling isotherm has a gaussian shape in the landau model .",
    "this was already pointed out in landau s original paper @xcite and has since survived as the generic ( but wrong ) statement that landau s model gives rise to gaussian rapidity distributions .",
    "in fact , there is _ no _ decoupling temperature where the full rapidity distribution including particles from the time - like parts resembles a gaussian , cf .",
    "[ ris : fig20 ] .",
    "another suggestion to circumvent the problem of negative particle numbers is , instead of freezing out along an isotherm which has time - like parts , to freeze out along a surface which is space - like everywhere , for instance , a curve of constant time in the center - of - mass frame , cf .",
    "[ ris : fig21 ] . in this case , all particles are accounted for , since the decoupling surface is bounded by the lightcone , and no particle can escape through the lightcone .",
    "the problem is , that also in this case , the spectra differ considerably from a freeze - out at constant temperature , cf .",
    "[ ris : fig22 ] .",
    "this uncertainty is clearly unwanted when one wants to quantitatively compare fluid - dynamical model predictions with experimental data .",
    "the correct formula to compute the number of particles which physically decouple from the system was given in @xcite : @xmath486 the additional @xmath487-function ensures that negative contributions to the cooper ",
    "frye formula are cut off .",
    "the problem with this formula is that these negative contributions were necessary to globally conserve energy , momentum and net charge number , cf .",
    "the derivation of the conservation equations in section 2 .",
    "the violation of the conservation equations introduced by the freeze - out prescription ( [ ris : modcooper ] ) can , however , be circumvented by adjusting temperature , chemical potential , and the average particle 4-velocity in the single - particle distribution function @xmath158 in ( [ ris : modcooper ] ) in such a way as to preserve the conservation laws . in other words ,",
    "one must not use temperature , chemical potential , and fluid 4-velocity on the fluid side of the freeze - out surface in ( [ ris : modcooper ] ) , but modified values which ensure that energy , momentum , and net charge is conserved .",
    "one way to achieve this is to assume that the freeze - out surface actually is a conventional fluid - dynamical discontinuity across which energy , momentum , and net charge number are conserved .",
    "solving the corresponding algebraic conservation equations ( with energy - momentum tensor and net charge current on the post freeze - out side of the discontinuity constructed from ( [ ris : nmukin],[ris : tmunukin ] ) with @xmath158 replaced by @xmath488 ) yields the required modified values for temperature , chemical potential , and average particle 4-velocity on the post freeze - out side . for more details , see @xcite .",
    "however , it still remains to be shown with an explicit calculation whether this suggestion to solve the freeze - out problem is viable in the general case .",
