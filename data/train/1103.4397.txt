    "the central problem in classical knot theory is the complete classification of knots and links up to ambient isotopy in three - space .",

    "further , the braid group provides a fundamental algebraic structure associated with knots .",
    "the alexander theorem tells us that every knot or link can be isotoped to braid form .",
    "the capstone of this relationship is the markov theorem , giving necessary and sufficient conditions for two braids to close to isotopic links . since the discovery of the jones polynomial @xcite the first invariant for knots and links that was constructed using braids the markov theorem received renewed attention .    among other proofs of the markov theorem , in @xcite we introduced a new type of braid move , the @xmath0move , and we proved an _",
    "one - move _ markov theorem .",
    "the @xmath0move is a very simple uniform geometric move that can be applied anywhere in a braid to produce a braid with the same closure .",
    "more precisely , an _",
    "@xmath0move _ consists in cutting a strand of the braid and taking the top end to the bottom of the braid and the bottom end to the top of the braid , both entirely over or both entirely under the braid , creating a new pair of corresponding braid strands . by small braid isotopies ,",
    "an @xmath0move is equivalent to adding an in - box crossing in the braid , aquiring thus an algebraic expression .",
    "see fig .  5 for illustrations .",
    "consequently , in @xcite the @xmath0move approach was used for proving braid equivalence theorems ( analogues of the markov theorem ) for classical knots and links in knot complements , in closed , connected , oriented ( c.c.o . )",
    "@xmath1manifolds and in handlebodies .",
    "further , using the @xmath0move methods , we proved in @xcite braid equivalence theorems for the virtual braid group , for the welded braid group and for some analogues of these structures .",
    "finally , in @xcite an @xmath0move singular braid equivalence is given , using the algebraic singular braid equivalence of @xcite .",
    "given a diagrammatic knot theory there are deep interrelations between the diagrammatic knot isotopy in this theory , the braid structures and the corresponding braid equivalence .",
    "on the other hand , braid equivalence theorems are important for understanding the structure and classification of knots and links in various settings . also , for constructing invariants of knots and links using algebraic means .    in this survey paper",
    "we present the @xmath0move methods of the author and collaborators and how they can serve for establishing and proving braid equivalence theorems for the diagrammatic settings mentioned above . in section  1",
    "we discuss braiding and braid equivalence for knots in @xmath2 .",
    "we describe a generic braiding method that can adapt to any diagrammatic setting , we define the @xmath0moves , and we give the one - move markov theorem ( theorem  [ lthm ] ) . in section  2",
    "we present the @xmath0move methods for deriving braid equivalences , geometric and algebraic , for knots in knot complements , in c.c.o .",
    "@xmath1manifolds and in handlebodies .",
    "finally , in section  3 we describe how the @xmath0moves adapt for deriving braid equivalences for virtual knots , welded knots , flat knots and for singular knots .",
    "more precisely : the diagrammatic equivalence in a specific topological setting , but also moves that are not allowed in the setting , define the corresponding braid isotopy , the way the closure of a braid is realized , and also the types of @xmath0moves needed for the corresponding braid equivalence .",
    "in the case of knots and links in knot complements , in c.c.o .",
    "@xmath1manifolds and in handlebodies , the basic idea was to represent the manifold by a braid in @xmath2 and then links and braids in the manifold by mixed links and mixed braids in @xmath2 .",
    "then to translate isotopy in these spaces in terms of mixed link isotopy in @xmath2 , according to the hosting manifold each time .",
    "the main difference among the knot theories in these spaces is that in a handlebody a knot may not pass beyond the boundary of the handlebody from either end , and this is reflected both in the definition of the closure of a braid ( see figs .",
    "27 , 28 ) as well as in the corresponding braid equivalence .",
    "further , in the case of c.c.o .",
    "@xmath1manifolds we have an extra isotopy move ( from the case of knot complements ) coming from the handle sliding moves related to the surgery description of the manifold .",
    "all these are explained in section  2 .    regarding the @xmath0move braid equivalence corresponding to the knot isotopy in a given setting , there are two conceptual steps : first create the @xmath0move braid equivalence on a geometric level",
    ". then take into account the algebraic structures of the braids and the algebraic expressions of the @xmath0moves ( using the interpretation of an @xmath0move as introducing an in - box crossing , see fig .  6 for braids in @xmath2 ) and turn the geometric braid equivalence into an algebraic braid equivalence .",
    "the interpretation of an @xmath0move as introducing an in - box crossing is also very crucial in the search of the types of @xmath0moves needed in a specific diagrammatic setting , as they are related to the types of kinks allowed in the given diagrammatic isotopy .",
    "for example , in the virtual domain we have @xmath0moves introducing a real or a virtual crossing , facing to the right or to the left of the braid .",
    "moreover , the presence of the two forbidden moves in the theory leads to the fact that the strands of an @xmath0move cross the other strands of the braid only virtually , and also to a type of virtual @xmath0move coming from a ` trapped ' virtual kink ( see definitions  10 , 11 and  12 ) . as another example",
    ", in the singular domain we do not have @xmath0moves introducing a singular crossing , as the closure of such a move would contract to a kink with a singular crossing , and this is not an isotopy move in the theory .",
    "all these are discussed in section  3 .    regarding the algebraic braid equivalences , surprisingly conjugation by a braid generator",
    "may sometimes be achieved simply by @xmath0moves within the braid .",
    "then , such conjugations will not appear in the geometric statement of the braid equivalence .",
    "but there are also situations where a braid generator , even if it has an inverse , can not be conjugated . for example",
    ", the loop generators @xmath3 in a handlebody of genus @xmath4 ( see subsection  2.4 ) , which can be conjugated in the case of knot complements . then",
    ", such conjugations will not appear even in the algebraic braid equivalence of the theory .",
    "finally , there are braid structures where some generators do not have inverses ( e.g. the singular crossings @xmath5 in singular knot theory ) , so conjugation by these generators may not appear in the braid statement . yet",
    ", a cutting line is permitted to cut a closed braid before or after a braid generator @xmath6 .",
    "for this reason we will adopt the following more general move , which is equivalent to conjugation if @xmath6 has an inverse .",
    "@xmath7 _ commuting in @xmath8 : @xmath9 , _    where @xmath8 denotes the set of braids with @xmath10 strands in the given diagrammatic knot theory .",
    "there may be also situations where the cutting line of the closure can not cut anywhere ( for example , singular knot theory in a handlebody ) .",
    "for this reason we will adopt the more general stabilization move :    @xmath7 _ stabilization in @xmath11 : @xmath12 , _    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "stabilization by a real crossing may occur in all the above - mentioned knot theories .",
    "this is because the isotopy move ri is permitted in all these theories . yet ,",
    "stabilization by a singular crossing is not permitted in singular braids .",
    "the @xmath0moves between braids are very fundamental and they provide a flexible conceptual center from which to deduce many results .",
    "they may be adapted to any diagrammatic setting where the notion of braid and diagrammatic isotopy is defined , and they provide a uniform ground for formulating and proving braid equivalence theorems , first geometric and then algebraic .",
    "moreover , the local algebraic versions of the braid equivalences in the various settings , as they arise using the @xmath0moves , promise to be useful for constructing invariants of knots and links in these settings .    as we said earlier ,",
    "the differences in the various settings lie in the knot isotopies allowed or not allowed in the theory , and these will be reflected in the way the closure of a braid is defined and in the corresponding braid equivalences .",
    "for instance , one could work out braid equivalences for the virtual or the welded or the singular knot theory in knot complements , in c.c.o .",
    "@xmath1manifolds or in handlebodies . in future work",
    "we intend to apply our methods to transverse knots and to knots in thickened surfaces .",
    "all the issues treated in this paper are expanded , discussed thoroughly and proved in detail in the author s monograph @xcite .",
    "a _ link _ of @xmath15 components is the homeomorphic image of @xmath15 copies of the circle into three - space and a knot is a link of one component .",
    "the central problem in classical knot theory is the complete classification of knots and links in @xmath2 up to ambient isotopy .",
    "reidemeister @xcite translated isotopy in space into a discrete diagrammatic equivalence relation on knot diagrams in the plane , generated by the three well  known reidemeister moves ri , rii , riii together with planar isotopy , see fig .  1 .",
    "further , isotopy of oriented links uses all variations of the reidemeister moves resulting in from all different orientations of the arcs involved . in the sequel , whenever we say ` knots ' we shall mean both knots and links .",
    "braids , as topological objects , are similar to links , but they have an algebraic structure .",
    "a _ braid _ on @xmath10 strands consists in @xmath10 arcs embedded in a thickened square @xmath16 \\times [ 0,\\epsilon ] \\times [ 0,1]$ ] , such that the ends are arranged into @xmath10 collinear top endpoints in @xmath16 \\times [ 0,\\epsilon ] \\times \\{1\\}$ ] and @xmath10 collinear bottom endpoints in @xmath16 \\times [ 0,\\epsilon ] \\times \\{0\\}$ ] and such that the embedding is monotonous with respect to the height function , that is , there are no local maxima or minima .",
    "two braids are isotopic if one can be deformed to the other via an isotopy that preserves the braid structure .",
    "braids shall be identified with braid diagrams ( that is , regular projections on @xmath16 \\times \\{\\epsilon\\ } \\times [ 0,1]$ ] ) with no risk of confusion .",
    "algebraically , the set of braids on @xmath10 strands forms the classical braid group @xmath17 @xcite , @xcite , whose generators @xmath18 are the elementary positive crossings between consecutive strands and they satisfy the defining _ braid relations _ : @xmath19 the first relation is the most characteristic , and it reflects the braid isotopy move riii ( all arrows down ) .",
    "also , the fact that the generators @xmath20 are invertible is reflected into the braid isotopy move rii .",
    "an excellent reference on braid groups is @xcite .",
    "by definition a braid has a natural orientation ( from top to bottom ) . taking the closure of a braid @xmath21 , that is , joining its corresponding endpoints with simple unlinked arcs to the side of the braid yields an oriented link , denoted @xmath22 .",
    "conversely we have :    [ j.  w.  alexander , 1923 ] [ alex ] any oriented link in @xmath2 is isotopic to the closure of a braid ( not unique ) .",
    "brunn @xcite proved that any link has a projection with a single multiple point ; from which it follows immediately ( by appropriate perturbations ) that we can braid any link diagram .",
    "apart from alexander @xcite , other proofs of theorem  [ alex ] have been given by morton @xcite , yamada @xcite , vogel @xcite , by the author with rourke @xcite , and by the author with kauffman @xcite , where the emphasis is given on braiding virtual knots .",
    "we shall present here two braiding algorithms , that of @xcite and that of @xcite , both conceptually very simple and both based on the same idea .",
    "the context of both braidings is that of @xcite : any link diagram can be arranged to be in general position with respect to the standard height function on the plane .",
    "this means that it does not contain any horizontal arcs and it can be seen as a composition of horizontal stripes , each containing either a local minimum or a local maximum or a crossing .",
    "the idea of the braiding is on the one hand to keep the _ down ",
    "arcs _ of the diagram that are oriented downward and , on the other hand , to eliminate the _ up  arcs _ that go upward and produce instead braid strands . first consider up  arcs that contain no crossings .",
    "call such an arc in the diagram a _",
    "arc_.    [ braiding ] a _ braiding move _ on a free up ",
    "arc is the following elimination operation of it : we cut the arc at any point .",
    "we then pull the two ends the upper upward and the lower downward , keeping them aligned , and so as to obtain a pair of corresponding braid strands , both running entirely _ over _ the previously constructed tangle or entirely _ under _ it .",
    "view fig .  2 for an abstract illustration .",
    "arc is cut at the topmost point and the two ends are both pulled over the rest of the diagram , which is represented by the bold circle .",
    "the closure of the resulting tangle is a link diagram , obviously isotopic to the original one .",
    "indeed , from the up  arc we created a stretched loop , which by move ri is isotopic to the original free up ",
    "note that in fig .",
    "2 a faint arc is also illustrated inside the braid . it should be ignored in this definition ; we shall refer to it later .        in @xcite , before performing the braiding moves we prepare the diagram by rotating all crossings that contain up - arcs , so that the arcs that pass through any crossing are directed downward .",
    "there are two types of rotation : if both arcs of the crossing go up , then we rotate the crossing by 180 degrees .",
    "if only one arc in the crossing goes up , then we rotate it by 90 degrees .",
    "see figs .  3 and  4 .",
    "these rotations may produce new free up  arcs . after adjusting all the crossings we then braid all the free up  arcs .",
    "the resulting tangle is the desired braid , the closure of which is isotopic to the original diagram .            in @xcite we do not rotate the crossings .",
    "instead , we apply the braiding move also to the up  arcs going through crossings .",
    "the difference here is that we have to label each up  arc as _ over _ or _ under _ according to its position in the crossing , and then the resulting strands from the braiding move will be both over or under the rest of the diagram accordingly , see @xcite for details .",
    "for example , in fig .  2 consider the up  arc creating a crossing with the faint arc .",
    "then the up  arc is the over arc and it is labelled  o \" , so the two new strands are stretched over the rest of the diagram .",
    "the advantage of the braiding technique in @xcite is that it applies equally well to the virtual category , to flat virtuals , to welded knots and to singular knots , see @xcite for details .",
    "it applies , in fact , to all the categories in which braids are constructed .",
    "the braiding technique in @xcite is preferred in situations where we need to analyze how the isotopy moves on diagrams affect the final braids , see @xcite for details .",
    "trying now to use braids for studying knots we need to know when two braids correspond to isotopic knots .",
    "the markov theorem gives an equivalence relation in the set of all braids @xmath23 reflecting isotopy of knots :    [ a. a. markov , 1936][markov ] two oriented links in @xmath2 are isotopic",
    "if and only if any two corresponding braids in @xmath24 differ by braid relations and the moves :    \\(i ) conjugation in @xmath17 :  @xmath25 ,    \\(ii ) bottom stabilization in @xmath24 :  @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "conjugation can be generalized to the braid equivalence move _ commuting _ described in the introduction .",
    "indeed , conjugation is clearly related to isotopy move rii occurring in the back side of a closed braid @xmath28 .",
    "opening @xmath28 with a cutting line , this line will either put both crossings of the move at the same side of the braid ( and then the initial rii move becomes the braid cancellation @xmath29 ) or it will separate the two crossings , one at the top and one at the bottom of the braid , yielding a conjugate of @xmath30 . since the @xmath20 s are invertible , commuting in this case is equivalent to conjugation . regarding the bottom stabilization , we just note that the more general stabilization move described in the introduction together with move ( i ) implies bottom stabilization .",
    "stabilization is related to the isotopy move ri , since the closure of a braid with a stabilization move is a knot with a kink at that place .",
    "the markov theorem is not easy to prove .",
    "its proof is very technical and it depends on the braiding algorithm used .",
    "markov @xcite used alexander s braiding algorithm .",
    "the markov theorem was originally stated by markov @xcite with _ three _ braid moves and then weinberg @xcite reduced them to the _ two _ braid moves of theorem  [ markov ] .",
    "birman @xcite gave a more rigorous proof , filling in all details of markov s original proof , using a more rigorous version of alexander s braiding algorithm .",
    "bennequin @xcite gave another proof using contact topology .",
    "after the discovery of the jones polynomial @xcite the first knot invariant that was constructed using braids and the markov theorem other proofs of theorem  [ markov ] have been given by : morton @xcite using his threading algorithm , by the author with rourke @xcite using the braiding algorithm of @xcite and the new type of braid move , the @xmath0move ( see below ) , by traczyk @xcite using vogel s braiding algorithm , and by birman and menasco using bennequin s ideas .    in @xcite using the @xmath0moves we proved , in fact , the following sharper version of theorem  [ markov ] ( cf .",
    "@xcite , thm .",
    "[ lthm ] two oriented links in @xmath2 are isotopic if and only if any two corresponding braids differ by braid relations and the @xmath0-moves .",
    "[ lmove ] an _ @xmath0move _ consists in cutting a strand of the braid at a point , then pulling the two ends of the cut , the upper downward and the lower upward , both running entirely _ over _ the braid or entirely _ under _ it , and keeping them aligned ( on the vertical line of the cutpoint ) so as to obtain a new pair of corresponding braid strands .",
    "thus there are two types of @xmath0moves , an _ under @xmath0move _ , or _",
    "@xmath31move _ , and an _ over @xmath0move _ , or _",
    "@xmath32move_. fig .",
    "5 illustrates an example of the two @xmath0moves .",
    "further , by a small braid isotopy that does not change the relative positions of endpoints , an @xmath0move is equivalent to adding an in - box crossing ( positive or negative ) facing the right - hand side or the left - hand side of the braid box .",
    "so , the @xmath0move generalizes the stabilization move .",
    "view last instance of fig .  5 , where a positive in - box crossing is formed and two dots are placed to indicate the starting points of the @xmath32move .",
    "see also fig .  6 for an abstract illustration . closing the new pair of strands created from an @xmath0move results in a kink in the tangle diagram ,",
    "so it corresponds to the isotopy move ri .",
    "moves , width=566 ]    the version of an @xmath0move introducing an in - box crossing gives rise to the following algebraic expression for an @xmath32move and an @xmath31move respectively : @xmath33 @xmath34    where @xmath35 , @xmath36 are elements of @xmath17 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 are obtained from @xmath35 , @xmath36 by replacing each @xmath39 by @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "move , @xmath32move with crossing and its algebraic expression , width=529 ]    theorems  [ markov ] and  [ lthm ] imply that braid conjugation follows from the @xmath0moves .",
    "this fact is also directly illustrated in fig .",
    "moves , width=529 ]    theorem  [ lthm ] has three main advantages : first , there is only one type of braid equivalence move .",
    "second , the @xmath0moves are very local and fundamental .",
    "thus , adapted each time to a given diagrammatic setting ( where diagrammatic isotopy is given and the notion of a braid can be defined ) , they may provide a uniform ground for formulating and proving geometric analogues of the markov theorem .",
    "third , due to the fact that the @xmath0moves have algebraic expressions , these geometric statements can be turned into algebraic statements , according to the braid structures of the given situation ( which , in turn , depend on the diagrammatic equivalence and the manifold where the diagrams live ) .",
    "it is a well  known result in topology that any c.c.o .",
    "@xmath1-manifold can be obtained via surgery on an unoriented framed link in @xmath2 with integral framings .",
    "the intermediate stage of surgery is the construction of the complement of the surgery link . by the term",
    "` knot complement ' we shall be referring throughout to both knot and link complements .",
    "another category of bounded 3-dimensional manifolds that give rise to c.c.o .",
    "3-manifolds are the handlebodies , via the heegaard decomposition .",
    "the special case of the solid torus is the only manifold common in both categories , and its knot theory has been studied quite extensively from various viewpoints .",
    "as we shall establish in this section , knots and braids in all three categories of 3-dimensional manifolds may be studied via very similar diagrammatic representations in @xmath2 and very similar techniques .",
    "the differences lie in the knot isotopies allowed or not allowed in each manifold , and these will be reflected in the way we define the closure of a braid and in the corresponding braid equivalences .",
    "the underlying braid moves that lead to algebraic braid equivalences in all these manifolds are the @xmath0moves .",
    "let @xmath42 be the complement of the oriented link @xmath43 in @xmath2 . by the alexander theorem and the definition of ambient isotopy , @xmath42 is homeomorphic to @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the closure of some braid @xmath46 and it is isotopic to @xmath43 . throughout this section",
    "the braid @xmath46 will remain fixed .",
    "let , further , @xmath0 be an oriented link in @xmath44 . fixing @xmath45 pointwise on its projection plane we may represent @xmath0 unambiguously by the _ mixed link _ @xmath47 in @xmath2 , that is , a link in @xmath2 consisting of the _ fixed part _",

    "we shall refer to @xmath49 as the _ surgery link _ and we shall be writing @xmath50 . so @xmath48 may be represented in @xmath2 by the framed braid @xmath49 .",
    "further , fixing @xmath49 pointwise , we have that links in @xmath48 can be unambiguously represented by mixed links in @xmath2 exactly as in the case of knot complements .",
    "so , we follow the same diagrammatic setting .    trying to find an analogue of the markov theorem for links in @xmath44 or @xmath51 we observe first that @xmath45 must remain fixed .",
    "so , we need a braiding process for mixed link diagrams that maps @xmath45 to @xmath46 and not to an @xmath0equivalent braid or even to a conjugate of @xmath46 . such braids are called geometric mixed braids .",
