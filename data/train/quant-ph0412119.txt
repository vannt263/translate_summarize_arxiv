    "in a previous article @xcite we have argued that the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  can play an important role in teaching quantum mechanics since it provides an alternative view - point and illustrates the peculiar features of quantum phenomena .",
    "of course most adherents of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  would assign a more ambitious meaning to the theory and do rather claim its superiority to the ordinary formulation ( or interpretation ) of quantum mechanics . in this note",
    "we will examine some common objections raised against the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory .    in answering the question posed in the title one should first remark that the ongoing debate on the foundations of quantum mechanics has produced a vast number of different schools and interpretations .",
    "presumably , the majority of physicists has lost track of this complex debate about the measurement problem , hidden variables , epr , bell etc . in a similar context",
    "this was strikingly expressed by david mermin :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ contemporary physicists come in two varieties .",
    "type 1 physicists are bothered by epr and bell s theorem .",
    "type 2 ( the majority ) are not , but one has to distinguish two subvarieties .",
    "type 2a physicists explain why they are not bothered .",
    "their explanations tend either to miss the point entirely ( like born s to einstein ) or to contain physical assertions that can be shown to be false .",
    "type 2b are not bothered and refuse to explain why .",

    "another reason for being rather indifferent to the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  is evidently the following .",
    "this theory can be viewed as a way to solve the conceptual problems of quantum mechanics .",
    "those who are satisfied with the answers given by the standard interpretation ( e.g. david mermin @xcite ) or who favor other non - standard interpretations ( like many - worlds , consistent histories , floyd s trajectory interpretation or the like ) are consequently not attracted by the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory .    however , our concern is with criticism and objections which are explicitly directed against the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory .",
    "it is rather popular among adherents of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  to blame mainly historical and sociological reasons for the contempt of their theory @xcite .",
    "we do not negate that these reasons may have played some role , although such a claim is hard to verify explicitly . in any case",
    "such a position renders the criticism as completely irrational and makes a sober discussion difficult .",
    "in fact there has been response to e.g. bohm s paper from 1952 .",
    "wayne myrvold , who has analyzed early objections against the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory , writes @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ bohm s theory did not meet with the acceptance in the physics community that bohm had hoped for .",
    "it was not , however , ignored ; several prominent physicists , among which were einstein , pauli , and heisenberg , wrote articles expressing their reasons for not accepting bohm s theory . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in what follows we will also explore these early objections .",
    "the objections against the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  can roughly be divided into two classes .",
    "the first applies meta - theoretical considerations i.e. invokes criteria like symmetry or simplicity to discard the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory .",
    "section  [ meta ] is devoted to these arguments .",
    "the other class of criticism seeks for a more textual or theory - immanent debate , like challenging the consistency or the ability of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  to be generalized .",
    "this debate will be reviewed in section  [ textual ] .",
    "for completeness we will give a brief summary of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  in sec .",
    "[ nut ] . a thorough discussion of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  can be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  describes a non - relativistic @xmath1-particle system by its wavefunction , @xmath2 , and the position , @xmath3 , of the corresponding quantum objects ( e.g. electrons , atoms or the like ) .",
    "the wavefunction , which is derived from the ordinary schrdinger equation , guides the particle motion via the so - called guidance equation : @xmath4 here @xmath5 denotes the mass of particle @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the nabla operator applied to its coordinates and @xmath8 the phase of the wavefunction in the polar representation @xmath9 .    since the guidance condition  [ ge ] is a first - order equation , one initial condition fixes the motion uniquely .",
    "given a @xmath10 distribution as initial positions equ .",
    "[ ge ] will reproduce all predictions of ordinary quantum mechanics in terms of position distributions .",
    "since all measurements can be expressed in terms of position ( e.g. pointer positions ) this amounts to full accordance with all predictions of ordinary quantum mechanics .",
    "thereby the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  assigns a distinguished role to position and does not independently assign possessed - values to other observables .",
    "this ensures that the kochen - specker `` no - go '' theorem does not apply to the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory . what might be regarded as the values of quantum observables like spin , momentum or the like get established only in the context of a corresponding measurement - like experiment . from the viewpoint of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory",
    "this `` contextuality '' amounts essentially to the observation , that the outcome of an experiment depends on the way it is performed .    as mentioned above the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory",
    "reproduces all predictions of ordinary quantum theory provided that the initial positions of particles described by the wavefunction @xmath2 are @xmath11 distributed .",
    "the motivation of this so - called quantum equilibrium hypothesis  has been explored for example in @xcite .",
    "most important , the quantum mechanical continuity equation ( equ .",
    "[ ce ] ) ensures that this condition is consistent i.e. any system will stay @xmath11 distributed if the quantum equilibrium hypothesis  holds initially .",
    "@xmath12 it follows that in a universe being in quantum equilibrium it is not possible to control the initial positions beyond the @xmath11 distribution .",
    "hence the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory   does not allow for an experimental violation of heisenberg s uncertainty principle @xcite . while ordinary quantum mechanics assumes that probability enters on a fundamental level , the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  is deterministic and probability enters only as an expression of ignorance .",
    "however , given the quantum equilibrium hypothesis  this ignorance holds in principle .",
    "thus the fundamental determinism is turned into predictive indeterminism .",
    "the important feature of equ.[ge ] is its non - locality .",
    "the guidance equation links the motion of every particle to the configuration of the whole system , no matter how distant its different parts are",
    ". technically expressed this follows from the fact , that the wavefunction @xmath2 ( hence its phase @xmath8 ) at a given time is a function on the configuration space @xmath13 .",
    "it is exactly this non - locality which allows the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  to violate the bell inequalities @xcite as demanded by experimentbroglie - bohm theory .",
    "the first shows that `` hidden variable '' theories have to be non - local in order to agree with the predictions of quantum mechanics .",
    "the second rules out that a mapping of all observables to possessed values can be achieved .",
    "hence , the corresponding properties of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  ( namely the non - locality and contextuality ) are no shortcomings but necessities . ] . however , this non - locality vanishes if the wavefunction factorizes in the contributions of the different particles .",
    "the guidance condition  [ ge ] can be motivated in different ways and its precise status gives rise to different interpretations of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory .",
    "the starting point of bohm s original presentation of the theorybroglie - bohm theory  since louis de@xmath0broglie presented similar ideas already in 1927 @xcite .",
    "david bohm s work in 1952 was done independently . ] in 1952 @xcite was the decomposition of the schrdinger equation for the wavefunction @xmath9 into a set of two equations for the real functions @xmath14 and @xmath8 .",
    "the resulting equation for @xmath8 has a structure similar to the classical hamilton - jacobi equation for the action @xmath8 , which implies @xmath15 .",
    "the only difference is the appearance of an extra term which bohm named `` quantum potential '' : @xmath16 bohm ( and later also e.g. hiley @xcite and holland @xcite ) regard the quantum potential as the key ingredient of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  and derive all its novelty from it .",
    "the guidance equation  [ ge ] is only viewed as a `` special assumption '' @xcite or a `` consistent subsidiary condition '' @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this position another school of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  regards the guidance condition as the fundamental equation and avoids emphasizing the quantum potential .",
    "the main proponents of this school are drr et al .",
    "@xcite who have named their version of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  `` bohmian mechanics '' .",
    "this view was anticipated by john bell in his work on the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory@xcite .",
    "in fact the guidance equation can be motivated without appeal to the hamilton - jacobi equation from symmetry arguments alone @xcite . according to this position the quantum potential deserves no special attention and is rather viewed as an artefact which enters the discussion when the classical limit of the theory is treated .",
    "one should not mistake this discussion as only quibbling over a mathematical ambiguity in the formulation of the theory .",
    "in fact these different interpretations of equ.[ge ] are related to a substantial difference of view on e.g. the role of `` observables '' other than position or the meaning of the wavefunction .",
    "our discussion of objections against the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  is in part complicated by this debate on the interpretation .",
    "if some criticism applies more strongly or solely to one specific interpretation of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory , it does not undermine the concept as a whole .",
    "likewise the different interpretations provide different replies to the objections .",
    "the different interpretation of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  will be disentangled elsewhere @xcite .    since the rest of our note",
    "will be concerned with the objections against the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  we should balance the discussion by some brief remarks on its merits .",
    "the supporters of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory   emphasize its `` clear ontology '' i.e. that the vague notion of `` complementarity '' and wave - particle duality becomes dispensable . within the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  one",
    "can consistently entertain the notion of particle trajectories .",
    "however , this should not be misunderstood as adherence to classical prejudices but provides an elegant solution of the measurement problem .",
    "the superposition of the wavefunction at the end of a measurement causes no difficulty since the actual position of the system corresponds to the actual outcome .",
    "in addition the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  provides means to deal non - ambiguously with the question of tunneling time or time - of - arrival @xcite .",
    "some authors also suggest that the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  has conceptual advantages over quantum mechanics in connecting quantum mechanics to other theories such as chaos theory and classical mechanics @xcite or when dealing with cp violation @xcite .",
    "most authors accept that the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  and ordinary non - relativistic quantum mechanics make identical predictions i.e. that no experiment can decide which one to preferbroglie - bohm theory  and quantum mechanics disagree are actually pointless since the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  reproduces all predictions of ordinary quantum mechanics by definition .",
    "above all , the schrdinger - equation is part of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  and the individual trajectories can not be controlled beyond the quantum equilibrium . ] .",
    "even wolfgang pauli admitted in a letter to bohm from december 1951 :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ i do not see any longer the possibility of any logical contradiction as long as your results agree completely with those of the usual wave mechanics and as long as no means is given to measure the values of your hidden parameters ( ... ) .",

    "heisenberg questioned whether the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  should be regarded as a new theory at all :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ from the fundamentally _",

    "we classify them as `` meta - theoretical '' since they are largely based on requirements which are supposed to apply to physics theories in general .",
    "the obvious objection against the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  is that it does not make any new predictions while postulating the particle - position as a new entity .",

    "pauli and heisenberg based their rejection of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  mainly on its asymmetry with respect to position and momentum @xcite . in the absence of any new prediction they did not accept this sacrifice .",
    "the reply to this objection is twofold : ( i ) the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  gives position a different ontological status than all other `` observables '' @xcite in order to achieve a clear ontology and to solve conceptual problems of the ordinary formulation of quantum mechanics . after all symmetry is no end in itself .",

    "the predicted outcome of any such _ measurement _ of e.g. the particle - momentum would be the same as in ordinary quantum mechanics .",
    "more generally , the einstein - objection illustrates , that within the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  the representation of any system is provided by the _ pair _ of wavefunction and position , @xmath18 . to focus on properties of one element",

    "squires writes in the same context , that einstein `` was not interested in attempts to ` cure ' the theory ; rather he wanted to look elsewhere , to start again '' @xcite .",
    "squires makes an other insightful remark about the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  and einstein s probable reason to reject it : `` and it is certainly true that we would not have discovered statistical mechanics by adding small corrections to thermodynamics , or by adding hidden variables that were in some way ` guided ' by the free energy , or some other thermodynamic quantity '' @xcite . ] .",
    "the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  reproduces the statistical predictions of ordinary quantum mechanics and underpins them with deterministic and continuous particle - trajectories .",
    "it is tempting to regard the bohm - trajectories as the actual motion of the quantum - objects .",

    "[ ge ] as representing the `` actual motion '' of the quantum particles .    in order to sustain the `` ontological status '' of the bohm trajectories one has to formulate additional criteria which restrict the possible value of the vector field @xmath22 .",
    "e.g. drr et al .",
    "@xcite motivate the guidance equation [ ge ] from symmetry and simplicity constraints . the argument in @xcite",
    "is based on the assumption that the corresponding problem for relativistic spin @xmath23 particles has been solved uniquely @xcite .",
    "holland and philippidis then derive the guidance equation for the non - relativistic limit and result in a equation which contains an additional spin - dependent term . hence , for spin 0 particles",
    "the original form is recovered .",
    "however , this ambiguity of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  does not undermine its conceptual value . if the above motivations for the specific guidance condition ( equ .",
    "[ ge ] ) are felt unconvincing , the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  still provides a proof of principle that the deterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics is possible .",
    "since the measurement of individual trajectories is beyond the principle reach of experiments one should not put too much emphasize on their particular form anyway .      as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ nut ] , the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  reproduces all predictions of ordinary quantum theory provided that the initial positions of particles described by the wavefunction @xmath2 are @xmath11 distributed .",
    "one may include this assumption in the very definition of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory .",
    "equation [ ce ] ensures that this postulate is consistent i.e. any system will stay @xmath11 distributed when the quantum equilibrium hypothesis  holds initially .",
    "however , introducing the quantum equilibrium hypothesis  as a postulate provokes the objection that thereby the wavefunction gets two distinct and logically independent meanings : ( i ) as the guiding field and ( ii ) as a probability distribution for the particle position . this double role for the wavefunction",
    "looks suspicious and unaesthetic .",
    "further more it would remain obscure how random behavior enters into the deterministic de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory .",
    "finally the very meaning of such a postulate would be not clear at all .",
    "it was therefore among the early efforts of bohm to clarify the status of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis  and to possibly derive rather than postulate it .",
    "the paper @xcite from 1953 was devoted to this question but could derive the quantum equilibrium hypothesis   only for a limited class of systems @xcite .",
    "this problem gave rise to the development of a modified version of the theory in 1954 including the effect of a stochastic disturbance @xcite .",
    "a dynamical explanation of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis  within the original version of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  was also attempted by valentini @xcite .",
    "a different approach was developed by drr et al .",
    "their analysis is an elaboration of work of john bell and is ultimately rooted in the approach of ludwig boltzmann to statistical mechanics .",
    "the starting point is that regarding the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  as a fundamental theory implies that the behavior of subsystems is determined by the `` wavefunction of the universe '' , @xmath24 , and the corresponding configuration .",
    "one is therefore not free to simply postulate that subsystems have wavefunctions and are governed by the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory .",
    "however , applying the quantum equilibrium hypothesis   to @xmath24 seems to be physically meaningless since we do not have a sample of universes .",
    "thus the following two questions need to be addressed : ( i ) how to assign a wavefunction to a subsystem and ( ii ) what is the meaning of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis  when applied to @xmath24 .",
    "finally one can ask how to relate these points i.e. how to justify the quantum equilibrium hypothesis  for empirical distributions .",
    "question ( i ) leads drr et al . to the introduction of the _ effective _ wavefunction .",
    "let @xmath25 be a decomposition of the configuration of the universe into the variable @xmath26 of a subsystem and @xmath27 for the rest .",
    "drr et al .",
    "define the _ effective _ wavefunction , @xmath2 , of the subsystem as part of the following decomposition : @xmath28 the wavefunction @xmath29 represents the subsystem provided that the @xmath27-support of @xmath30 and @xmath31 is macroscopically distinct and that the actual value of @xmath27 lies in the support of @xmath30 .",
    "a typical situation of this kind occurs during a measurement on the system described by @xmath26 with a measuring device that has , at the end of the measurement , a definite value in the support of @xmath30 .    regarding ( ii ) drr et al .",
    "argue , that the meaning of the quantum equilibrium distribution @xmath32 on the universal level is _ not _ probabilistic since we do not have a sample of universes .",
    "instead , it provides a so - called measure of _ typicality_. the notion of _ typicality _ ( though not the word ) was introduced by boltzmann in justifying the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "this statement holds because an `` overwhelming majority '' of initial conditions leads to a behavior in accordance with the second law @xcite .",
    "however , the meaning of `` overwhelming majority '' i.e. a measure on the corresponding set , needs to be specified .",
    "one important requirement for this measure is that it should be `` equivariant '' i.e. the notion of typicality should be independent of time . and in fact , the continuity equation [ ce ] ensures that the measure @xmath32 is equivariant . finally , and that is the central result of @xcite , drr et al .",
    "can prove that within a `` typical '' universe the quantum equilibrium hypothesis  holds for all subsystems . hence the typical bohmian universe  although deterministic  gives the _ appearance _ of randomness in agreement with quantum mechanics .",

    "until now we were mainly concerned with meta - theoretical objections which might be viewed as partially subjective .",
    "consequently , some of the above mentioned feature of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  have been either used to reject this theory or to praise its radical novelty .    an other strategy to disclaim",
    "the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  has been to seek for a more textual debate , e.g. challenging its consistency or its ability to be generalized .",
    "one might say that these arguments try to refute the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory   from `` inside '' , hence we have classified them as `` theory - immanent '' .",
    "most important is the question whether a trajectory - interpretation is sustainable in the relativistic domain .",

    "the attempts to construct circumstances in which the predictions of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  and quantum mechanics disagree are actually pointless since the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  reproduces all predictions of ordinary quantum mechanics by definition .",

    "before we turn to the actual essw argument we will first discuss the original set - up .    the delayed - choice double - slit experiment ( see fig .",
    "[ ds ] ) consists of a double slit arrangement in which one can freely choose to detect either interference patterns in the region i or particles in the detectors @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "the whole arrangement is set up in such a way that by symmetry arguments the trajectories of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  are not allowed to cross the midplane behind the two - slit screen .",
    "they show the `` unclassical '' behavior , that the bohm - trajectories of the particles hitting the upper part behind the screen have traversed the upper slit and vice versa .",
    "= 2.5 in    one may modify the arrangement by supplying it with additional detectors directly behind the two - slit screen in order to investigate which slit has been traversed . in such a modified version",
    "the interference pattern would not occur .",
    "additionally the de@xmath0broglie - bohm trajectories would be allowed to cross the midplane since , given the degrees of freedom related to the detector , it is no symmetry plane anymore ( see @xcite[p.111 ] for the details of this argument . ) .",
    "the above mentioned extra - detectors directly behind the screen were assumed to be `` ordinary detectors '' , i.e. devices which show a macroscopic change of state ( e.g. pointer positions ) .",
    "we now turn to the actual essw argument . according to these authors",
    "a problem for the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  emerges when these extra detectors are chosen to be advanced quantum optical devices , so - called `` which - way detectors '' .",
    "these respond on the transition of single particles without affecting the translational part of the wavefunction . again , in the presence of these devices , we expect the interference pattern to be destroyed .",
    "the special feature of these `` one - bit detectors '' is that even their excitation does not alter the symmetry ( i.e. @xmath35 , with @xmath36 being the midplane ) .",

    "however , most adherents of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  never argued that point .",
    "a recent argument against trajectory - based interpretations of quantum mechanics in general and the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  in particular was advanced by hall @xcite .",

    "given that the corresponding states and their unitary evolution are well defined hall claims that trajectory - based interpretations are at least _ formally _ incomplete .",

    "this issue was settled in @xcite .",
    "only recently tumulka and teufel @xcite have simplified and extended this proof to the bohm - dirac theory . if a wavefunction satisfies the conditions for global existence and uniqueness , then it is ensured that it can not evolve into e.g. a fractal state @xcite .",
    "hence , hall s claim about a possible `` physical incompleteness '' seems to be unfounded and his claim of `` formal incompleteness '' amount to no more than a specific definition of `` formal '' .",
    "the by far most common objection against the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory   is based on its non - locality and its apparent conflict with relativity .",
    "we will try to disentangle these questions in turn .",
    "the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  is explicitly non - local , i.e. the motion of each particle is in general a function of the coordinates of the whole system , no matter whether they are space - like separated .",
    "this non - locality vanishes only if the wavefunction factorizes in the contributions of the different quantum objects . whether this is viewed as an unacceptable feature depends on the attitude towards the problem of non - locality in quantum mechanics in general . in ordinary quantum mechanics",
    "the problem of non - locality appears in at least two places : ( i ) violation of bell - inequalities and ( ii ) reduction of the wavefunction .",
    "following the work of bell @xcite and the experimental confirmation of quantum mechanics in epr - bell experiments @xcite it became widely ( but not universally @xcite ) accepted that quantum mechanics itself is `` non - local '' .",
    "following this opinion the non - locality allegation against the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  seems to be even completely groundless .",
    "however , the precise meaning of the term `` non - local '' is far from being unique and their exists a vast literature on that topic ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a thorough discussion of that issue is far beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "however , one can reasonably state , that the `` non - locality '' of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  is more explicit ( i.e. dynamical ) than the `` non - separability '' of ordinary quantum mechanics . anyhow , for both , ordinary quantum mechanics and the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory , it is ensured that the `` non - locality '' or `` non - separability '' can not be used for superluminal signalling . but whether this is enough for full compatibility between quantum mechanics and special relativity has been challenged e.g. by ballentine @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ however it is not clear that the requirements of special relativity are exhausted by excluding superluminal signals . nor",

    "after all the collapse is supposed to reduce the wavefunction instantaneously and requires thereby a preferred frame - of - reference @xcite .",
    "maudlin argues that the collapse postulate in combination with entangled states leads necessarily to a preferred foliation of space - time @xcite .",
    "while the dirac equation provides a lorentz covariant generalization of the schrdinger equation the satisfactory generalization of the measurement theory into the relativistic domain is still wanting .",
    "ironically this specific source of non - locality does not arise in the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  since here the collapse of the wavefunction becomes dispensable .",
    "however , as mentioned above , non - locality figures prominently in the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory   which makes the reconciliation with relativity challenging as well .",
    "non - locality clearly provides a challenge for a satisfactory relativistic generalization of quantum mechanics or the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory .",
    "however , relativistic generalizations of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  do exist .",
    "e.g. for a dirac particles bohm @xcite has proposed the following guiding equation ( the corresponding framework may be called `` bohm - dirac theory '' ) : @xmath43 here @xmath2 is a solution of the dirac equation , @xmath44 its conjugate and @xmath45 a 3-vector with components that are build from the pauli matrices : @xmath46 the generalization to the many - particle case is straightforward @xcite[p.274 ] . thus , the generalization itself is not problematic .",
    "but it is an essential property of the many - particle generalization that it requires a preferred reference - frame i.e. the many - particle analogue of equ .",
    "[ dirac ] considers all particles at the _ same _ time .",
    "the predictions do nonetheless agree with the standard theory and most important the preferred reference - frame can be made unobservable .",
    "in fact , as shown in @xcite , it is even possible to restore lorentz invariance for the bohm - dirac theory by introducing additional structure .",
    "drr et al .",
    "introduce an arbitrary space - like preferred slicing of space - time , determined by a lorentz invariant law . an other strategy is pursued by berndl et al .",
    "@xcite who suggest a preferred joint parameterization ( i.e. synchronization ) .",
    "this works provide an important step towards a lorentz invariant de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  and a counter example to the common claim that non - locality and lorentz invariance are in strict opposition .",
    "however , these authors admit that they have not reached yet what bell called `` serious lorentz invariance '' @xcite[p.179f ] .",
    "furthermore the corresponding models consider only entangled but _ noninteracting _ dirac particles .",
    "the relativistic generalization of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  is also addressed in @xcite .",
    "a thorough discussion of the relation between non - locality and relativity can be found in @xcite .",
    "summing up , we have seen that non - locality and the relativistic generalization provide a challenge not only for the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  but also for ordinary quantum mechanics - particle system is defined on the configuration space , @xmath13 , it is not surprising that this `` non - locality '' is not a particular problem of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  but for quantum mechanics in general . ] .",
    "the violation of the bell - inequality implies that the relation between quantum mechanics and special relativity is more subtle than customarily assumed .",
    "the concept of wavefunction collapse points at similar problems .",
    "however , the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  does allow for a relativistic generalization when either the requirement of lorentz invariance is relaxed to apply only to the observations or by introducing additional structure into the theory .",
    "finally ( and related to the last paragraph ) there is the widespread suspicion that the concepts of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  can not be sustained in the realm of quantum field theories ( see e.g. the letter to the editor in @xcite[p .",
    "1227 ] together with the reply ) .",
    "however , several works on that issue have shown that there seems to be no principle problem to incorporate the concepts and reproduce the predictions of quantum field theories . in what follows",
    "we only sketch some of the corresponding results .",
    "similar to the situation of relativistic generalizations there are several different approaches to this question .",
    "the work on that issue can roughly be divided into two camps .",
    "the first ( e.g. bohm , hiley and holland @xcite ) introduces the notion of ( bosonic-)field variables as being fundamental together with the particle position for fermions .",
    "these models provide laws for the evolution of these fields .",
    "however , boson like e.g. the photon do not possess a trajectory .",
    "the other camp ( e.g. bell @xcite[p.173 ] and drr et al .",
    "@xcite ) sustains the particle - ontology also within quantum field theoretical extensions of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory . to this end drr",
    "associate the interaction part of the hamiltonian with jump - processes like the creation of particle - antiparticle pairs .",
    "while important questions remain open ( see for example the discussion at the end of @xcite ) it seems premature to reject the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  on this basis .",
    "we have collected common criticism against the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory .",
    "most of them have the merit to illustrate the peculiar features of this theory but they do not provide a rigorous disproof .    one strategy has been to formulate additional requirements which are not met by the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory . it remains subjective whether this is viewed as a profound shortcoming or the radical novelty of this theory .",
    "after all , quantum mechanics has likewise introduced many bizarre notions into physics . however , while it is subjective how desirable these additional requirements are , they are clearly not irrational .    a different strategy is to address the consistency of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  and its ability to be generalized .",
    "the most substantial concern is the question of its relativistic and quantum field theoretical generalization .",
    "however , several models for such generalizations do exist in which either the preferred foliation of space - time is unobservable or even lorentz - invariance can be ( at least formally ) sustained .",
    "although important questions remain open it seems premature to reject the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  on this account . above all , these objections should be compared to those which have been advanced against other interpretations of quantum mechanics , in particular against the orthodox view .",
    "the merit of this discussion is to reveal that even in science a theory can not only be judged by its empirical confirmation . in the absence of any experimental test that can distinguish between standard quantum mechanics and the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  one",
    "may either leave this question undecidable or has to invoke e.g. `` meta - theoretical '' criteria like the one presented in sec .",
    "this is completely sound but should be stated explicitly .",
    "we fully agree with hiley who states :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ unfortunately there is a great deal of unnecessary emotion generated when `` alternative interpretations '' to quantum mechanics are discussed .",
    "by now we have so many interpretations , that it must be clear to all that there is some basic ambiguity as to what the formalism is telling us about the nature of quantum processes and their detailed relation to those occurring in the classical domain . @xcite _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _      it would be highly desirable to have an open minded discussion in the spirit of appreciation for the different interpretations .",

    "<S> this note collects , classifies and evaluates common criticism against the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory , including ockham s razor , asymmetry in the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory , the `` surreal trajectory '' problem , the underdetermination of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory  and the question of relativistic and quantum field theoretical generalizations of the de@xmath0broglie - bohm theory . </S>",
