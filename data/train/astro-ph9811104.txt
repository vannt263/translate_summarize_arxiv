    "a robust determination of the local ( z=0 ) radio luminosity function ( rlf ) of normal galaxies , jointly with similar determinations carried out at cosmological distances ( e.g. prandoni et al .",
    "1998 ) , is the essential tool for addressing several relevant cosmological issues , such as estimating the rate of evolution in galaxies , more directly than by modeling the distribution of the faint radio source counts ( see condon 1989 ) .",
    "+ since the seventies this issue received strong attention among the scientific community , culminating with the analyses of elliptical galaxies by auriemma et al .",
    "( 1977 ) and of spiral galaxies by hummel ( 1981 ) .",
    "the study of the radio properties of late - type galaxies in the coma supercluster by gavazzi & jaffe ( 1986 ) contributed establishing that the radio continuum luminosity of these galaxies is to first order proportional to their optical luminosity , and to second order to their current star formation rate .",
    "in other words , cosmic ray electron acceleration is provided primarily by type ii supernovae explosions ( see also condon 1992 ) which are more abundant in massive spiral galaxies .",
    "+ deep radio surveys , carried out in the nineties with the vla , provided the mean of re - determining the rlf of elliptical galaxies ( ledlow & owen 1996 ) , which turned out to be in remarkable agreement with the early determination of auriemma et al .",
    "their main finding is that the probability of e galaxies to develop powerful radio sources ( @xmath6 ) is strongly dependent on their optical luminosity ( @xmath7 ) . below @xmath8",
    "this dependence becomes weaker with decreasing @xmath9 .",
    "+ due to the lack of extensive radio and optical surveys of galaxies of both early- and late - type , the present knowledge is still limited to relatively bright radio sources ( @xmath10 ) and bright optical luminosities ( @xmath11 ) , typical of giant galaxies .",
    "+ to go one step further it seems natural to re - determine the rlf using the virgo cluster , which contains thousands of galaxies , spanning a large luminosity range , from giant to dwarfs as faint as @xmath5 mag .",
    "surprisingly the latest systematic study of this cluster at centimetric wavelengths dates back 1981 , when kotanyi ( 1981 ) carried out with the wsrt a survey of this cluster .",
    "not only these early measurement were limited by the current sensitivity ( several mjy / beam ) , but also they lacked the necessary cluster coverage .",
    "+ we are now in the position of re - addressing the issue taking advantage of the recent all sky nvss radio survey carried out with the vla ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) and of the supreme quality of the virgo cluster catalogue ( vcc ) of binggeli et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , which provides us with reliable photometry and classification for over 2000 galaxies . the major improvement of the new radio observations is not primarily their higher sensitivity , which is in fact only few times better than previously available , but mostly the unprecedented homogeneous sky coverage .",
    "+ in this paper we make use of the nvss data to construct the rlf of an optically complete ( @xmath12 ) sample of galaxies extracted from the vcc . with these data",
    "we wish to discuss two issues : i ) is the dependence of the rlf on hubble type well determined ?",
    "ii ) does the dependence of the rlf on galaxy mass , which is known to exist for giant galaxies , extend to the dwarf population ?",
    "issues i ) and ii ) are addressed in section 4 .",
    "+ in a companion paper ( gavazzi & boselli 1999 : paper ii ) we address another question : iii ) is the local rlf of late - type galaxies universal or is it influenced by the environment ? to study this issue",
    "we compare the rlfs of late - type galaxies in five nearby clusters ( virgo , cancer , a262 , a1367 and coma ) with that of galaxies in less dense regions of the universe at similar distances .",
    "@xmath13 is used throughout this paper .",
    "the present investigation is based on the virgo cluster catalogue ( vcc ) by binggeli et al .",
    "the vcc catalogue contains 2096 galaxies brighter than @xmath14 .",
    "photographic photometry with @xmath3 0.35 mag uncertainty and detailed morphological classification are given in the vcc .",
    "the vcc coordinates are affected by @xmath3 10 arcsec uncertainty ( binggeli et al .",
    "1985 ) or slightly better .",
    "the vcc also contains a ( morphological ) estimate of the membership to the various structures constituting the virgo cluster : cluster a ( m87 ) , cluster b ( dominated by m49 ) , w , w , m clouds , and southern extension .",
    "general members and possible members are treated in this work as belonging to the cluster .",
    "+ we use an updated version of the vcc containing the following improvements : i ) for 305 galaxies listed in binggeli & cameron ( 1993 ) we substitute the eye estimated @xmath15 with @xmath16 obtained on digitized plates .",
    "ii ) we include the redshift and consequent membership re - assignments given in binggeli et al .",
    "we complement these data with ( few ) other redshifts found in the new extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "iii ) for 565 galaxies we substitute the celestial coordinates with the more precise ones ( few arcsec ) listed in ned . by comparing this set of new coordinates with the original vcc ones we find an rms difference of 6.75 arcsec .",
    "we extract from the catalogue a subsample of 1342 objects complete to @xmath17 . among these ,",
    "589 have yet no redshift in the literature ( 140 are possible members , 379 belong to cluster b and another 70 are background galaxies ) .",
    "based on the most recent cepheyds determination , we consider members of clusters a and b , general members , members of clouds w , m and southern extension at the distance of 17 mpc .",
    "members of w cloud are taken at 28 mpc ( see also gavazzi et al .",
    "1998 ) .      radio continuum 1.4 ghz data in the regions covered by the present investigation are available from a variety of sources : + 1 ) full synthesis and snap - shot observations of specific regions were undertaken with the vla and with the wsrt ( `` pointed '' observations ) .",
    "hummel ( 1980 ) and kotanyi ( 1980 ) did observations of the virgo cluster with the wsrt .",
    "condon ( 1987 ) and condon et al .",
    "( 1990 ) observed with the vla nearby galaxies projected onto the virgo region .",
    "these surveys do not generally constitute a complete set of observations .",
    "+ 2 ) recently , the all - sky nvss survey ( condon et al . 1998 ) carried out with the vla at 1.4 ghz became available .",
    "the d array ( fwhm = 45 arcsec ) nvss survey covers the sky north of @xmath18 , with an average rms=0.45 mjy . except in specific regions of the sky near bright sources , where the local rms is higher than average , this survey offers an unprecedented homogeneous sky coverage .",
    "it not only provides us with extensive catalogues of faint radio sources , but also with homogeneous upper limits at any celestial position .",
    "the vcc region is covered by 13 nvss maps which are available via the world wide web .",
    "+ since radio data from more than one source exist for several target galaxies , we choose between them adopting the following list of priorities : + 1 ) in general we prefer nvss data to any other source because of its homogeneous character , relatively low flux density limit and because its fwhm beam better matches the apparent sizes of galaxies under study , thus providing us with flux estimates little affected by missing extended flux .",
    "+ 2 ) for individual bright radio galaxies ( e.g. m87 ) we prefer data from specific `` pointed '' observations since they should provide us with more reliable estimates of their total flux .",
    "+ 3 ) in all cases where the flux densities from nvss are lower than those given in other references we privilege the reference carrying the largest flux density .      at the position of all optically selected galaxies we search for a radio - optical coincidence . for the remaining undetected galaxies we compute an upper limit flux using @xmath19 . for the purpose of our study we proceed as follows : + 1 ) we pre - select sources from the nvss data - base , allowing for a maximum radio - optical positional discrepancy of 45 arcsec , because of the large apparent size of the galaxies in this nearby cluster .",
    "+ 2 ) we inspect the nvss maps at the position of all candidate radio - optical associations .",
    "we discard few spurious radio sources listed in the nvss database , which turn out to be grating rings associated with strong radio sources .",
    "these belong to 3 regions of approximately 40 arcmin radius around m87 , ngc4261 ( 3c-270 ) , and around the source @xmath20 . in these regions",
    "we also re - compute the local rms radio noise .",
    "+ 3 ) at the position of all pre - selected optical - radio matches we compute an `` identification class '' ( i d ) according to a criterion which is a slight modification of the one adopted by jaffe & gavazzi ( 1986 ) . for each galaxy",
    "we calculate the quantity : + @xmath21  ( 1 ) + where @xmath22 is the radio - optical positional offset , @xmath23 is the radio position uncertainty , and @xmath24 is the uncertainty in the galaxy position .",
    "the latter quantity is assumed to be the 3% of the galaxy optical diameter plus the uncertainty in the optical position itself : + @xmath25  ( 2 ) + where a is the galaxy optical major axis , and @xmath26 is the uncertainty in the optical position ( see section 2.1 ) .",
    "the errors on the radio positions are assumed to be inversely proportional to the signal - to - noise ratio as : + @xmath27  ( 3 ) + identification class id=1 includes pointlike radio sources with @xmath28 .",
    "+ identification class id=2 are extended sources not meeting the @xmath29 criterion .",

    "early type galaxies instead show a strongly non - linear behavior : galaxies fainter than approximately @xmath38 have an average radio luminosity @xmath39 , independent of their optical luminosity .",
    "galaxies brighter than @xmath38 have a radio luminosity strongly increasing with @xmath40 .",
    "these are the `` monster '' radio galaxies .",

    "given the small number of actual radio detections ( 180 ) with respect to the number of optical candidates ( 1342 ) , fig .",
    "1 might not give a realistic representation of the radio properties of an optically selected sample of galaxies .",
    "more appropriately , that can be derived in the form of the fractional radio luminosity function ( rlf ) , which gives the probability distribution @xmath41 that galaxies develop a radio source of a given luminosity ( @xmath9 ) , taking into account the number of detected objects @xmath42 in each bin of radio luminosity @xmath43 , as well as the upper limits ( see avni et al . 1980 ) .",

    "these galaxies develop radio sources with a broad range of power , whose nature is nuclear , thus it is only indirectly related with the total luminosity of their host galaxies . for early - type galaxies",
