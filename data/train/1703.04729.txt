    "because of the key role of adipose tissue in the energy homeostasis and associated diseases , there is a great deal of interest in understanding the biology of this tissue .",
    "very few is known about the key to understanding its structuration as lobules .",
    "we postulate that lobule emergence is the result of a self - organization process driven by bidirectional mechanical interactions between adipocytes and fibers .",
    "we test this hypothesis by means of a 2d individual based model of interacting adipocytes and fiber elements .",
    "indeed , our model produces structures that compare quantitatively well to the experimental observations .",
    "this clearly shows that cell clusters of adipose tissue could spontaneously emerge as a result of simple mechanical interactions , with no direct involvement of vasculature .",
    "white adipose tissue ( wat ) is the main energy store of the organism .",
    "it is interconnected with all physiological functions via its endocrine functions .",
    "it plays a key role in the energy homeostasis and weight of the organism .",
    "it is a highly plastic tissue composed of differentiated adipocytes that are able to store and release fatty acids as well as to secrete numerous cytokines and hormones @xcite .",
    "mature adipocytes represent only 40 to 60% of the whole cell population .",
    "the other cells form a heterogeneous population named the stroma - vascular fraction ( svf ) .",
    "adipocyte progenitors are present in the svf throughout adult life @xcite",
    ". they can proliferate and/or be recruited according to physiological or pathological situations , participate in the turnover of adipocytes and are also believed to be supporting cells . because of their important role and due to the explosive worldwide development of obesity , the molecular pathways driving adipocyte differentiation are now well investigated and described @xcite . in contrast , the global organization at the tissue scale is poorly understood . since wassermann s work in 1960 @xcite ,",
    "very few investigations have been performed at this scale .",
    "these seminal investigations revealed that adipose tissue is constituted of distinct lobules containing clusters of adipocytes .",
    "moreover , observing its development , wassermann described the emergence of mature wat from primitive structures constituted of an unstructured fiber network containing endothelial cells and fibroblast - like cells .",
    "the latter are believed to be preadipocytes . in adult",
    "adipose tissue , lobules housing adipocytes are separated from each other by well - structured separations ( or septa ) composed of extracellular matrix ( ecm ) @xcite .",
    "thereafter the number of lobular units seems to remain approximately constant . in excessive development of adipose tissue occurring during obesity ,",
    "increased fibrosis ( formation of excess fibrous tissue ) is observed and many reports associate these changes with adipocyte dysfunctions @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a proper maintenance of adipose tissue architecture is critical for its normal functionality .",
    "because the global architecture of adipose tissue and its organization into lobules are robust throughout adult life and seem to be fundamental elements of adipose tissue homeostasis , modeling the process of lobule emergence will greatly improve our understanding of adipose tissue biology and plasticity in physiological or pathological conditions .",
    "numerous models of tissue morphogenesis can be found in the literature , describing the emergence of self - organization of cells and fibers . due to their simplicity and flexibility ,",
    "the most widely used models are individual based models ( ibm ) ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they describe the behavior of each agent ( e.g. a cell or a fiber element ) and its interactions with the surrounding agents over time .",
    "due to the high computational cost of ibm , mean - field kinetic or continuous models , which are more efficient to describe the large scales , are often preferred .",
    "all these models include one or several of the following interactions : ( i ) cell / cell , ( ii ) cell - fiber and ( iii ) fiber - fiber interactions .",
    "models of interacting cells moving in ecm - free media such as @xcite focus on interactions of type ( i ) . based on the mechanisms reviewed in @xcite , a wide variety of models incorporating interactions of type ( ii )",
    "have been proposed such as : ( a ) mechanical models @xcite , ( b ) chemotaxis - type models ( @xcite and references therein ) , where cell motion is driven by chemical gradients or ( c ) models of contact guidance @xcite ( see @xcite ) where the ecm gives directional information for cell motion .",
    "however , how the processes are coordinated to produce directed motion is not well understood .",
    "fiber - fiber interactions have been explored in @xcite , where a model of a fibrous network composed of cross - linked fiber elements is proposed .",
    "other authors treat the fibrous network as a continuum , such as a porous medium @xcite or an active gel @xcite for instance .",
    "however , the literature so far provides little clues on the mechanisms underlying contact guidance or fiber self - organization . in the present paper",
    ", we demonstrate that directionally organized cell and fiber structures can emerge without appealing to contact guidance or fiber directional interactions , as a result of simple mechanical interactions between the cells and the fiber network . to test this hypothesis qualitatively , it is sufficient in a first instance to consider a two - dimensional model , which we do for reasons of simplicity and computational efficiency .",
    "our model is of more microscopic nature than previously proposed mechanical models @xcite and aims at describing the emergence of the lobular structures observed in adipose tissue .",
    "our goal is to test the scenario that , due to the fibers resisting the pressure induced by the growing adipocytes , the latter are forced to regroup into clusters .",
    "adipocyte clusters in turn force the fibers to merge into a well - organized network . to validate this scenario",
    ", we developed a two - dimensional ibm modelling adipocytes interacting with ecm fiber elements .",
    "the model and experiment data showed strikingly similar lobule - like structures and revealed that vasculature was not needed for lobular self - organization to emerge , although vasculature is a proven key factor of adipogenesis @xcite .",
    "fig . [ fig1 ] shows part of a sub - cutaneous adipose tissue from an adult mouse .",
    "the adipocytes were visualized by immuno - staining of perilipin , a protein that surrounds the unilocular lipid droplets . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a , the ecm fiber network appears in black as a background .",
    "this picture clearly reveals the organization of the adipose tissue in lobules .",
    "a 3d image of one isolated lobule is shown in supplementary information .",
    "we implemented classical image processing methods to extract the centers and radii of the cells ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) and the different lobules ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) ( see [ app : ip ] for details ) .",
    "the quality of the cell and lobule segmentation methods were carefully checked .    ]",
    "we postulated that , in wat , the agents contributing the most to mechanical balance were the ecm fibers and the adipocytes .",
    "the ecm was discretized into unit fiber elements consisting of line segments of fixed and uniform lengths represented by their centers and their directional unit vectors .",
    "we supposed that two fiber elements that crossed each - other could form a link , thereby creating a longer fiber .",
    "the cells were described as 2d spheres represented by their centers and radii . at any given time , the two sets of agents were supposed to realize the minimum of the mechanical energy of the system ( described below ) .",
    "we incorporated the following biological features  : _",
    "( i ) pre - adipocyte differentiation : _ immature cells are much smaller than adipocytes .",
    "so , we supposed that they had negligible impact on the mechanical equilibrium and we did not incorporate them in the model .",
    "the transformation of an immature cell into an adipocyte was modelled as the creation ( or `` insemination '' ) of a new adipocyte .",
    "all new adipocytes were inseminated with the same small radius .",
    "new adipocytes were inseminated at random times following a poisson process .",
    "the location of the insemination was also random with either uniform probability in the domain ( below referred to as `` random insemination '' ) or with a bias resulting in a higher insemination probability at locations where existing adipocytes were already present ( below referred to as `` biased insemination '' ) . in this biased insemination case ,",
    "the existing cell density in a disk of radius @xmath0 around the randomly chosen insemination point @xmath1 was computed and normalized by the maximal possible density ( corresponding to adipocytes in contact with each other ) , resulting in a dimensionless parameter @xmath2 comprised between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "then , the insemination probability at @xmath1 was taken proportional to @xmath5 , with biasing parameter @xmath6 .",
    "this modelled a quorum - sensing process where a pre - adipocyte sensed the adipocyte density @xmath2 up to a sensing distance @xmath0 and made a decision whether to differentiate into an adipocyte according to the value of the quorum - sensing parameter @xmath5 ( the larger @xmath7 , the larger the local adipocyte density needed to be to trigger differentiation ) .",
    "as developed in section discussion below , biased insemination indirectly accounted for the role of vasculature .",
    "_ ( ii ) adipocyte growth : _ the ability to store and release energy according to the needs of the organism was modelled through the regular growth of the cells .",
    "therefore , thanks to ( i ) and ( ii ) , we incorporated both hyperplasia ( cell number increase ) and hypertrophy ( cell size increase ) . as the turnover of adipocytes is small and not related to adipose tissue morphology @xcite",
    ", we neglected the apoptosis of adipose cells .",
    "we assumed that the volume of each adipocyte reached a maximal value beyond which it stayed constant . _",
    "( iii ) adipocyte incompressibility and non - overlapping : _ adipocytes are reservoirs of fat , which is an incompressible liquid , and they can not overlap . therefore , we assumed that the radius of each disk was unaffected by whatever mechanical efforts were exerted onto it and that two neighboring disks could not overlap . _",
    "( iv )  fiber resistance to adipocyte pressure : _ we viewed the ecm as a soft medium composed of fibers having locally preferred directions .",
    "each fiber element represented the elementary mechanical action that the ecm exerted on neighbouring cells .",
    "it carried a directional information corresponding to the preferred direction of the collagen fibers .",
    "the largest mechanical action of the fiber was exerted normally to this direction .",
    "the fibers repelled the cells by means of a soft potential allowing some penetration of the cells inside the ecm .",
    "a fiber element produced a unit of potential strength .",
    "larger mechanical actions were achieved by having several of these unit fiber elements in a close neighbourhood .",
    "obviously , there exists a limit to ecm strength , but we assumed that our system operated below that limit and we did not implement any upper bound on the number of fiber elements per unit area .",
    "in practice , we assumed that the fiber - cell repulsion potential iso - lines were ellipses with focii at the two ends of the fiber segment and that the potential vanished beyond a certain distance from the fiber .",
    "the choice of elliptic isolines corresponded to the simplest anisotropic shape in 2d . _",
    "( v ) fiber growth , elongation and ability to bend : _ in addition to carrying a unit of ecm fiber strength , fiber elements also carried a unit of fiber length .",
    "however , we provided a way to create longer fibers by allowing two crossing fibers to create a cross - link .",
    "any displacement of a cross - linked fiber pair would maintain the position of the cross - link relative to the center of each fiber .",
    "several consecutively cross - linked fiber elements would model a long fiber having the ability to bend or even take possible tortuous geometries . as the number of fibers cross - linked to a given fiber",
    "was not limited , we could also account for fiber branching .",
    "therefore , the cross - linking process would model fiber elongation @xcite and symmetrically , pairs of cross - linked fibers could also spontaneously unlink , allowing for fiber breakage describing ecm remodelling processes . linking and unlinking",
    "processes followed poisson processes with frequencies @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , and the parameter @xmath10 , where @xmath11 $ ] represented a measure of the fraction of linked fibers among the pairs of intersecting fibers . _",
    "( vi ) fiber alignment and resistance to bending : _ to model the ability of long fibers ( those made of several cross - linked fiber units ) to offer a certain resistance to bending , linked fibers were subjected to a potential torque at their junction .",
    "this torque vanished when the fibers were aligned , and consequently acted as a linked - fiber alignment mechanism .",
    "any force exerted by a cell in the vicinity of a cross - link would result in the cross - linked fibers making an obtuse angle with respect to one another until the exerted torque at the cross - linked balanced the effect of the force , thereby providing a discrete representation of the bending of a continuous beam .",
    "this torque was characterized by a stiffness parameter @xmath12 playing the role of a flexural modulus .",
    "the larger the @xmath13 the more rigid the fiber assembly was .",
    "the mechanical energy of the system included the cell - fiber interaction potentials ( iv ) and the linked fiber - fiber alignment potential ( vi ) . at each time step , a minimum of this mechanical energy subject to the nonoverlapping constraint between cells ( iii ) and to the linkeage constraint between linked fibers ( v ) was sought . at the beginning of the next time step ,",
    "new adipocytes were inseminated ( i ) , adipocyte radii were increased ( ii ) and pairs of fibers were linked / unlinked ( v ) .",
    "these phenomena disrupted the mechanical equilibrium and a minimum of this new energy was again sought , and so on .",
    "more specifically , the @xmath14 adipocytes were modeled as 2d growing spheres of center @xmath15 and radius @xmath16 for @xmath17 in @xmath18 $ ] , and the @xmath19 ecm fiber elements were represented by straight lines of fixed length @xmath20 , of center @xmath21 and orientational angle @xmath22 for @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "given a configuration at a fixed time , we denoted by @xmath24 the set of cell center positions and radii : @xmath25\\}$ ] and by @xmath26 the set of fiber center positions and fiber directional angles : @xmath27\\}$ ] .",
    "the global mechanical energy of the system was written : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 were the fiber - cell repulsion potential ( iv ) and the linked fiber - fiber alignment potential ( vi ) respectively : @xmath31 } p^t_{km } \\sin^2(\\theta_k - \\theta_m).\\label{potal } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the time - dependent coefficients @xmath32 were set to 1 if fibers @xmath33 and @xmath34 were linked at time @xmath35 and to 0 otherwise ( see [ app : timescale ] ) .",
    "the alignment potential @xmath30 of intensity @xmath13 consisted of the sum of elementary alignment potentials between fibers of a linked pair . the repulsion potential @xmath29 was supposed to be the sum of two - particle potential elements , @xmath36 , modeling the mechanical interaction between cell @xmath17 and fiber @xmath33 .",
    "the iso - lines of these potential elements consisted of ellipses with focii located at the two ends of the fiber segment ( see fig . [ potim ] ) .",
    "we supposed that fiber @xmath33 could repel cell @xmath17 up to a distance @xmath37 in its orthogonal direction , where @xmath16 is the radius of the cell and @xmath38 a model parameter .",
    "we stress the fact that fiber - cell repulsion aimed to model repulsion of the fiber by the border of the cell , while a cell was modeled by its center .",
    "therefore , the repulsion distance @xmath39 of the model corresponded to a repulsion distance @xmath40 from the border of the cell .     of radius @xmath16 .",
    "b : isolines of a potential generated by an horizontal fiber @xmath33 with @xmath41 .",
    "maximal repulsion distance @xmath37 in the orthogonal direction of the fiber . ]",
    "at each time step , the minimization of the global mechanical energy under the constraints ( iii ) and ( v ) was written : @xmath42 where @xmath43 expressed cell - cell nonoverlapping inequality constraints ( iii ) and @xmath44 expressed fiber - fiber linkeage equality constraints ( v ) ( see [ app : constraints ] ) , where : @xmath45 ^ 2 } , \\\\",

    "we send the reader to [ app : uzawa ] for more details on the numerical algorithm used for solving the minimization problem .",
    "the model was implemented on a 2d square domain and boundary conditions were assumed periodic ( i.e. each agent was assumed periodically repeated beyond the boundary of the square domain ) .",
    "the numerical simulations were initialized with a randomly distributed fiber network ( according to a uniform distribution over all possible direction angles or over a sub - interval of directions angles centered about a given angle @xmath48 and of width @xmath49 ) .",
    "new cells were inseminated at a constant rate until reaching a cell volume fraction of 50% , a number consistent with the experimental observations .",
    "we refer the reader to [ app : model ] for a more complete description of the model ingredients .",
    "the reference time was chosen to be 10 times the insemination time @xmath50 ( inverse of insemination rate ) , i.e @xmath51 , and the time step was chosen to be @xmath52 .",
    "simulations were stopped at dimensionless time @xmath53 . the time to reach the maximal number of cells corresponded to @xmath54 and that for cells to reach their maximal sizes to @xmath55 .",
    "simulations were run five times the time needed for all cells to reach their maximal sizes to ensure that an equilibrium was attained in the end . the fiber unlinking time @xmath56 varied between @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and the linking time @xmath59 ranged from about twice to ten times",
    "@xmath60 according to the value of @xmath61 .",
    "note that these are linking / unlinking times per fiber but the actual frequencies of linking / unlinking events must be multiplied by the number of fibers @xmath19 ( @xmath62 in our simulations , see [ app : timescale ] for details on the time scales ) .",
    "it is difficult to relate these time scales to actual biological time scales because adipocyte growth rate is highly variable according to the subject , its age , its diet , its energy consumption , etc . nonetheless , adipocyte turnover is low @xcite and so we can estimate that it takes about 100 days for a nascent adipocyte to grow to its maximum size . in our model ,",
    "a nascent adipocyte needs about 20 time units to grow , so , it is consistent to assume that one time unit of our model is about five days . in our model , we can estimate that there is significant ecm remodeling when at least @xmath63 of the fibers ( i.e about 100 fibers ) have been linked or unlinked . therefore , the ecm remodeling rate can be related to @xmath64 and consequently , the ecm remodeling time @xmath65 ranges between @xmath66 and @xmath67 days . in @xcite",
    ", it is estimated that ecm remodeling takes about 15 days which falls between these two bounds .     by estimating the adipocyte radius to @xmath68 from the experiments ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the fiber elements considered here were @xmath69 large and @xmath70 long . in @xcite , it is shown that the collagen fibers are organised into bundles of collagen fibrils .",
    "the bundle width varies from @xmath4 to @xmath71 depending on tissues and organs , and in loose connective tissues such as adipose tissue these bundles can run parallel to each other to be twined into larger bundles .",
    "as for the length of the fiber elements , we note that actual collagen fibers are able to bend around the cells .",
    "as in our model fiber elements are rigid , the bending ability of the fibers is restored by connecting fiber elements together without forcing them to be aligned ( the finite value of the flexural modulus @xmath13 allows for an angle between two connected fiber elements to appear ) .",
    "however , if the fiber elements are too long , the curvature of the resulting fiber may be too restricted . in order to describe fibers able to bend around the cells , the fiber element length should be about a cell diameter , i.e 60 @xmath72 m .",
    "in [ app : smallfib ] , we report on simulations using the values of fiber element length of 54 @xmath72 m and width 10@xmath72 m consistent with these considerations . however , these values lead to computationally intensive simulations and for the purpose of building a phase diagram of the system , we instead have used fiber element length 140@xmath72 m and width 60 @xmath72 m that lead to tractable simulations .",
    "the relevance of these parameters is assessed in[app : smallfib ] where we observe that the results with the more biologically relevant parameter values are similar to those obtained with the larger values , thus justifying the use of the latter for an extensive exploration of the parameter space .",
    "fig .  [ fig2 ] ( i ) shows a phase diagram representing the various morphologies obtained using random adipocyte insemination and varying the linking / unlinking frequency @xmath9 ( horizontal axis of the diagram ) as well as the linked fiber fraction @xmath61 ( vertical axis of the phase diagram ) .",
    "it illustrates that the linking - unlinking dynamics strongly influenced the morphology of the final structures .",
    "indeed , varying @xmath9 and @xmath61 , we observed that the cell cluster morphology changed from compactly shaped ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( i 1 ) or ( i 4 ) ) to elongatedly shaped ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( i 3 ) or ( i 6 ) ) , while the fiber cluster morphology changed from disordered ( fig .",

    "[ fig2 ] ( i 3 ) ) . for a slow linking - unlinking process ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( i 1 ) ) , the fiber network topology was almost frozen and this generated rigidly connected fiber structures that were too stiff to self - organize . a faster linking - unlinking process ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( i 2 ) ) allowed for the remodeling of the network topology and for the local alignment of the fibers thanks to the alignment torque generated at the links .     and of the linked fiber fraction @xmath61 .",

    "this led to computationally tractable simulations which could be exploited to explore the parameter space , generate the phase diagram and calibrate the parameters for comparisons with experimental data .",

    "simulation of the entire tissue using the model would be possible ( although computationally intensive ) by simply varying the parameters of the model to match the variation of the organizational level of the tissue .",
    "to our knowledge , this work is the first attempt to understand the emergence of the lobular structure of the adipose tissue by interfacing a mathematical model and experimental results .",
    "the originality of our work lies in the assumption that adipose tissue architecture results from a self - organization process principally driven by mechanical interactions between adipocytes and the ecm .",
    "this corresponds to a co - organization where the cell clusters and the fiber structures evolve simultaneously .",
    "our mathematical model is able to reproduce the clustering of adipocytes into lobular units surrounded by the ecm fiber network . simply varying a few parameters allowed us to span a large variety of morphologies .",
    "our results suggest that adipose tissue organization could be principally driven by mechanical cues , in addition to a limited number of biologically - controlled phenomena such as fiber - fiber chemical linking .",
    "they highlight the importance of the ecm and the mechanical forces induced by it .",
    "they are consistent with recent papers demonstrating the impact of the ecm and of its dysregulation ( i.e. fibrosis ) on adipose tissue function @xcite",
    ".     furthermore , the model can reproduce many different types of tissue morphologies by varying the parameters controlling the mechanical response of the ecm to the growth of adipocyte number and size .",
    "this gives us good confidence that although validated on mice , the model will be able to reproduce human adipose tissue .",
    "indeed , there is increasing evidence that the differences between adipose tissue structures observed in different species or even at different locations within the same species can be related to mechanical pressure , adipocyte sizes and ecm characteristics .",
    "for instance , @xcite proposes to define different types of subcutaneous wat in humans based on their observed structural and ultrastructural features .",
    "they describe lobular subtypes for fibrous white adipose tissue that can be found in regions where mechanical constraints are large .",
    "additionally they distinguish lobular and non lobular adipose tissue on the basis of the nature and richness of the ecm .",
    "all these differences in the mechanical and structural properties of the adipocytes and the ecm can be fed into the model to produce a wide array of different morphologies .",
    "the structures that emerged from the mathematical model can be classified into three types : ( a ) middle - sized compact cell clusters surrounded by a disorganized fiber network , ( b ) middle - sized compact cell clusters surrounded by a well - organized network of thick fiber threads , or ( c ) elongated clusters surrounded by a network of thin and rigid fiber threads .",
    "each type of structure corresponded to a range of model parameters of the fiber linking - unlinking dynamics .",
    "structures of type ( a ) were obtained for a slow fiber linking - unlinking dynamics .",
    "the rigidly connected fiber structures could not self - organize , leading to a disordered fiber network . however , the system was able to produce middle sized cell clusters of lobular shape as a result of cell - fiber repulsion .",
    "this reflected the ability for a connected fiber network to exert a pressure on the cell structures and confine them into separated zones .",
    "for a faster fiber linking - unlinking dynamics , the remodeling of fiber structures was enabled , and fibers could arrange more easily into organized patterns , thanks to the torque acting on linked fibers . for a well chosen range of the unlinking frequency @xmath9 and of the flexural modulus @xmath13",
    "( see discussion of @xmath13 in [ app : c1 ] ) , the model produced biologically relevant cell and fiber structures of type ( b ) .",
    "finally , structures of type ( c ) were observed for fast fiber linking - unlinking dynamics . in this case , fibers easily aligned with each other and fiber stiffness was reinforced by the links and associated torque acting on linked fibers .",
    "this imposed local directional constraints to cell cluster growth , favoring cell cluster elongation .",
    "moreover , due to increased fiber rigidity , the fibers failed to surround the cell structures .",
    "the present results , which show a segregation of cells and fibers and the emergence of alignment ( aka nematic order ) among the fibers is consistent with experimental and theoretical work about mixtures of isotropic and nematic particles .",
    "for instance , @xcite examines a mixture of _ f _ actin and inert polymer polyethylene glycol ( peg ) and observes that actin filaments bundle together when a threshold concentration of peg is reached . in @xcite , vibrofluidized steel rods in the presence of high concentrations of hard spheres self assemble into linear structures under similar conditions .",
    "these observations are consistent with monte - carlo simulations of mixtures of hard sphero - cylinders and spheres peformed in @xcite . in these references",
    ", the coalescence and nematic ordering of the rods is analyzed in terms of the depletion force stemming from volume exclusion effects .",
    "the phenomena observed in our simulations bear evident analogies with these observations , even though the fibers and cells do not interact via volume exclusion but through a soft repulsive potential .",
    "the difference is important in that the interaction remains active even in the absence of noise ( which was the case in our simulations ) while the depletion force vanishes in the same circumstance . in particular",
    ", this explains why we observe segregation and nematic ordering in the absence of noise .",
    "furthermore , the aforementioned references focus on the nematic ordering of the fibers , the spherical particles being introduced only for the purpose of reducing the free volume . in the present paper , we have provided evidence that this interaction could also affect the shapes of the clusters of spherical particles ( the cells ) and have provided quantitative analysis of this effect .",
    "the interesting finding is that the fiber nematic order reflects itself into the elongated shape of the cell clusters , an effect which we havent seen noticed elsewhere .     by correlating the appearance of new adipocytes to a larger concentration of existing adipocytes , biased insemination equipped our model with an indirect way to investigate the influence of vasculature",
    "indeed , blood supplies the substrates required for adipogenesis and favors the appearance of new adipocytes at the extremities of capillaries where existing adipocytes are already present , leading to a correlation between new adipocyte locations and those of existing ones . however , fully random insemination alone reproduced the global tissue organization qualitatively well , and little improvement was observed by turning biased insemination on .",
    "this result suggests that no preferred location for differentiation of immature cells into adipocytes is required .",
    "it looks inconsistent with wasserman s analysis @xcite and other works demonstrating that vasculature plays a key role in adipogenesis .",
    "indeed , it has been demonstrated that adipose progenitors reside in the adipose vasculature and that pericytes which enwrap capillaries could represent a reservoir of adipocyte progenitors @xcite .",
    "thus it is classically considered that the global adipose tissue architecture is primarily driven by vasculature @xcite .",
    "our findings open the possibility that the role of vasculature in the emergence of global adipose tissue architecture could be more complex than previously thought .",
    "other phenomena were explored , such as local fiber alignment ( to model ecm reorganization by stem cells ) or the suppression of isolated cells ( to model isolated cell apoptosis ) .",
    "these additional phenomena led to a broad range of tissue structures .",
    "although not necessarily relevant for adipose tissue , these structures could account for other organs ( such as muscles , liver , etc . ) or pathological adipose tissues ( such as fibrotic ones ) .",
    "more quantitative work is needed and these questions will be developed in future works .",
    "further improvements of the model could be made .",
    "vasculature formation could be explicitly introduced in the model and its role as a niche for pericytes and pre - adipocytes could be explored .",
    "incorporating immature cells could help investigating their role in the reconstruction of the ecm @xcite .",
    "similarly , coupling cell apoptosis with spontaneous ecm reconstruction @xcite would improve the treatment of the latter .",
    "the adipocyte growth law could be made dependent on the local stress as in @xcite .",
    "macroscopically , introducing a disruption of the equilibrium by suppressing a part of the tissue would open up new applications of the model , such as wound healing . from a mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "the development of a macroscopic model from the present ibm would allow us to perform simulations on larger domains and address the question of the organization of the whole tissue .",
    "a first step has been made in @xcite where a macroscopic model for interacting fibers has been derived .",
    "this macrocopic model has been further analysed and its derivation has been numerically validated in @xcite . from a biological viewpoint , experimental data on ecm protein deficient mice strains ( such as collagen type vi )",
    "@xcite will be helpful to further validate our model .",
    "designing new experiments allowing for the in - vivo registration and tracking of cell positions and ecm location during the development of adipose tissue would be of great value as giving unprecedented access to the time dynamics of the morphogenesis process .",
    "the model could also be extended to 3d without profound methodological modifications . indeed ,",
    "adipose lobules look like columnar structures with elliptic cross sections ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_3dlobule ] in [ app:3d ] ) . with the present 2d model , we have focused on the cross - sectional organization of the lobules . in order to get a full picture of the lobular organization",
    "a 3d model is necessary . to extend the model to 3d ,",
    "several options are possible .",
    "fibers could still be considered as line segments and their connection condition would allow for close but non - coplanar segments to connect with each other .",
    "another possibility to account for the fact that fiber septa are more akin to two - dimensional surfaces would be to introduce planar ecm elements in the form of disks .",
    "interconnecting disks would have the possibility to connect along their intersecting segments . on the other hand",

    "are elongated due to the rigidity of the fiber network induced by the fast linking frequency and the action of the alignment torque at the created links . in this case",
    ", the fiber network imposes its preferred direction to cell cluster growth and we recover elongated cell clusters as in the case of an initially isotropic fiber network ( see section [ main : results ] of the main text ) .",
    "[ aniso ] ( b ) shows that there exist a range of values of @xmath9 and @xmath110 for which the model is able to generate lobule - like cell clusters having anisotropic shapes and a preferred shape anisotropy direction .",
    "these configurations are obtained for @xmath32010^{-3 } , 10^{-2}[$ ] and for @xmath321 $ ] .",
    "in this section , we consider the combined effects of shortening the fiber element length , decreasing the cell - fiber interaction range and introducing a fiber - fiber repulsion potential .",
    "as described at the end of section [ main : model ] of the main text , this leads to a more biologically relevant range of parameters and phenomena . on the other hand , computing with short fiber elements",
    "necessitates a large number of such elements and is extremely time consuming . due to these computational constraints",
    ", the simulation of main text were run with longer fibers , larger cell - fiber interaction range and no fiber - fiber repulsion potential .",
    "the goal of this section is to support the relevance of this approach by showing that the results obtained in the present section with a more biologically relevant set of parameters and phenomena are similar to those described in the main text . that a large cell - fiber interaction range may have a similar effect as a smaller range combined with fiber - fiber repulsion makes reasonable sense .",
    "fibers group in clusters .",
    "if they undergo a repulsion potential , these clusters are wider and affect the cells in a similar way as if the clusters were thinner ( which is the case without fiber - fiber repulsion ) , but the cell - fiber interaction distance is larger , leading to about the same separation distance between cell clusters .    when using shorter fiber elements , we must be careful that initialization matters if we wish to compare them with longer fiber elements . also ,",
    "when the fiber element is shortened , its width encoded in the distance @xmath322 ( for cell - fiber interaction ) must be decreased in the same proportion .",
    "therefore , dividing the fiber length by two indeed means replacing a fiber element by four elements connected altogether to form a diamond - shaped structure like in fig .",
    "[ sidiamond ] .",
    "so , when using short fibers , we will randomly initialize diamonds like in fig .",
    "[ sidiamond ] .",
    "however , as soon as the simulation is started the fiber element links in the diamonds may be removed as a consequence of the unlinking process .",
    "so , the diamond shape structures may be dissolved or persist according to how fast the unlinking process is . considering an initial fiber network consisting of fibers longer than cell diameters",
    "is biologically plausible as collagen fibers may be produced before any implantation of adipocytes .",
    "indeed , in wound healing , it is well documented that the wound is first populated by fibers before the appearance of the first new cell .",
    "fiber elements in our model are not intended to reproduce a whole biological fiber but they rather produce a discretization of such fibers into rigid elements that can be computationally manipulated . at initialization",
    "actual biological fibers may be too long to be represented by a single short fiber element and need to be described by structures made of pre - assembled fiber elements .",
    "the chosen diamond shape structure is the simplest of such pre - assembled structure and it allows us to compare the results to those using large fibers as it produces similar potential isolines to the latter .",
    "now , to take into account fiber - fiber repulsion , we proceed as for fiber - cell repulsion as described in section [ app : meca ] and we suppose that the fiber repulsion potential @xmath323 consists of the sum of two - particle potential elements + @xmath324 modeling the mechanical interaction between fiber @xmath325 and fiber @xmath33 : @xmath326 for two given vectors @xmath327 , @xmath328 @xmath127 and two angles @xmath329 $ ] , @xmath330 reads : @xmath331 where @xmath332 is the distance function defined by eq .",

    "this is due to the fact that for small @xmath9 , due to its internal structure , the diamond like network is less compliant than the random one . as a result , the former exerts more pressure on the cells than the latter , favoring the emergence of small and round clusters of cells . for large @xmath9 , i.e fast remodelling of the fiber network , the internal diamond structure is quickly lost , and we recover the same values of the sq for diamond and random initial networks .    to sum up",
