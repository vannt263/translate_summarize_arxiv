    "an interacting electron gas in one dimension has many unusual properties , such as the spin - charge separation , the power law of correlation functions , and the linear dependence of the electron relaxation rate on temperature and frequency ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) .",
    "these one - dimensional ( 1d ) results are well established , in many cases exactly , by applying a variety of mathematical methods including the bethe ansatz , the bosonization , and the parquet , or the renormalization group . to distinguish the exotic behavior of the 1d electron gas from a conventional fermi - liquid behavior , haldane introduced a concept of the so - called luttinger liquid @xcite .    the discovery of high-@xmath0 superconductivity renewed interest in the luttinger - liquid concept .",
    "anderson suggested that a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas behaves like the 1d luttinger liquid , rather than a conventional fermi liquid @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to verify this claim rigorously , because the methods that prove the existence of the luttinger liquid in 1d can not be applied directly to higher dimensions .",
    "the bethe ansatz construction does not work in higher dimensions .",
    "the bosonization in higher dimensions @xcite converts a system of interacting electrons into a set of harmonic oscillators representing the electron density modes .",
    "this procedure replaces the exact @xmath2 commutation relations @xcite with approximate boson commutators , which is a questionable , uncontrolled approximation . on the other hand , the parquet method ,",
    "although not being as exact as the two other methods , has the advantage of being formulated as a certain selection rule within a standard many - body diagram technique ; thus , it can be applied to higher dimensions rather straightforwardly .",
    "the parquet method has much in common with the renormalization - group treatment of fermi liquids @xcite .",
    "the 1d electron gas has two types of potential instabilities : the superconducting and the density - wave , which manifest themselves through logarithmic divergences of the corresponding one - loop susceptibilities with decreasing temperature . within the parquet approach , a sum of an infinite series of diagrams , obtained by adding and inserting the two basic one - loop diagrams into each other , is calculated by solving a system of nonlinear differential equations , which are nothing but the renormalization - group equations @xcite .",
    "this procedure was developed for the first time for meson scattering @xcite and later was successfully applied to the 1d electron gas @xcite , as well as to the kondo problem @xcite and the x - ray absorption edge problem @xcite . by considering both the superconducting and the density - wave instabilities on equal footing and adequately treating their competition , the parquet approximation differs from a conventional ladder ( or mean - field ) approximation , commonly applied in higher dimensions , where only one instability is taken into account . under certain conditions in the 1d case",
    ", the superconducting and density - wave instabilities may cancel each other , giving rise to a non - trivial metallic ground state at zero temperature , namely the luttinger liquid . in this case",
    ", the parquet derivation shows that the electron correlation functions have a power - law structure , which is one of the characteristic properties of the luttinger liquid @xcite .",
    "one may conclude that the competition between the superconducting and density - wave instabilities is an important ingredient of the luttinger liquid theory .    in a generic higher - dimensional case , where density - wave instability does not exist or does not couple to superconducting instability because of corrugation of the fermi surface ,",
    "the parquet approach is not relevant .",
    "nevertheless , there are a number of higher - dimensional models where the parquet is applicable and produces nontrivial results .",
    "these include the models of multiple chains without single - electron hopping @xcite and with single - electron hopping but in a magnetic field @xcite , as well as the model of an isotropic electron gas in a strong magnetic field @xcite . in all of these models ,",
    "the electron dispersion law is 1d , which permits to apply the parquet method ; at the same time , the interaction between electrons is higher - dimensional , which makes a nontrivial difference from the purely 1d case . the particular version of the parquet method used in these cases",
    "is sometimes called the `` fast '' parquet , because , in addition to a `` slow '' , renormalization - group variable , the parquet equations acquire supplementary , `` fast '' variables , which label multiple electron states of the same energy .    taking into account these considerations",
    ", it seems natural to start exploring a possibility of the luttinger liquid behavior in higher dimensions by considering a model that combines 1d and higher - dimensional features .",
    "this is the model of an electron gas whose fermi surface has flat regions on its opposite sides .",
    "the flatness means that within these regions the electron dispersion law is 1d : the electron energy depends only on the one component of momentum that is normal to the flat section . on the other hand , the size of the flat regions is finite , and that property differentiates the model from a purely 1d model , where the size is infinite , since nothing depends on the momenta perpendicular to the direction of a 1d chain .",
    "a particular case of the considered model is one where the 2d fermi surface has a square shape .",
    "this model describes 2d electrons on a square lattice with the nearest - neighbor hopping at the half filling .",
    "it is a simplest model of the high-@xmath0 superconductors .",
    "the model has already attracted the attention of theorists .",
    "virosztek and ruvalds studied the `` nested fermi liquid '' problem within a ladder or mean - field approximation @xcite .",
    "taking into account the 1d experience , this approach may be considered questionable , because it does not treat properly the competition between the superconducting and the density - wave channels .",
    "houghton and marston @xcite mapped the flat parts of the fermi surface onto discrete points .",
    "such an oversimplification makes all scattering processes within the flat portion equivalent and artificially enhances the electron interaction .",
    "mattis @xcite and hlubina @xcite used the bosonization to treat the interaction between the electron density modes and claimed to solve the model exactly .",
    "however , mapping of the flat fermi surface onto quantum chains and subsequent bosonization by luther @xcite indicated that the treatment of mattis and hlubina is insufficient , because the operators of backward and umklapp scattering on different quantum chains require a consistent renormalization - group treatment .",
    "luther did not give solution to this problems , as well as he missed the interaction between the electrons located on four different quantum chains .",
    "in the present paper , we solve the model consistently , using the fast parquet approach , where all possible instabilities occurring in the electron system with the flat regions on the fermi surface are treated simultaneously .",
    "this approach was applied to the problem earlier @xcite in order to explain the antiferromagnetism of chromium . in the present paper ,",
    "we advance the study further by including the order parameters of the odd symmetry , missed in @xcite , performing detailed numerical calculations , and investigating the effect of a curvature of the fermi surface . to simplify numerical calculations and to relate to the high-@xmath0 superconductors , we consider the 2d case , although the method can be straightforwardly generalized to higher dimensions as well .",
    "we find that the presence of the boundaries of the flat portions of the fermi surface has a dramatic effect on the solutions of the parquet equations .",
    "even if the initial vertex of interaction between electrons does not depend on the momenta along the fermi surface ( which are the `` fast '' variables ) , the vertex acquires a strong dependence on these variables upon renormalization , which greatly reduces the feedback coupling between the superconducting and density - wave channels relative to the 1d case",
    ". instead of the two channels canceling each other , the leading channel , which is the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) in the case of the repulsive hubbard interaction , develops its own phase transition , inducing on the way a considerable growth of the superconducting @xmath1-wave susceptibility . at the same time",
    ", the feedback from the superconducting to the sdw channel , very essential in the 1d case , is found negligible in the 2d case .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with the picture of the antiferromagnetically - induced @xmath1-wave superconductivity , which was developed within a ladder approximation for the flat fermi surface in @xcite and for a generic nested hubbard model in @xcite .",
    "recent experiments strongly suggest that the high-@xmath0 superconductivity is indeed of the @xmath1-wave type @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our results disagree with refs.@xcite .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy is that the bosonization arbitrarily replaces the exact @xmath2 commutation relations @xcite by approximate boson commutators ; thus , the renormalization of the electron - electron interaction , which is an important part of the problem , becomes neglected .",
    "in addition to having the flat sides , the square fermi surface also has sharp corners , where the saddle points of the electron dispersion law , which produce the van hove singularity in the density of states , are located .",
    "the presence of the van hove singularity at the fermi level enhances the divergence of the superconducting and density - wave loops to the square of the temperature logarithm .",
    "the fast parquet problem was formulated in this case in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the contribution from the flat sides , being less divergent than the contribution from the saddle points , was neglected .",
    "the present paper completes the study by considering a fermi surface with the flat sides and rounded corners , that is , without saddle points at the fermi level .",
    "our physical conclusions for both models are in qualitative agreement .    as photoemission experiments",
    "@xcite demonstrate ( see also @xcite ) , many of the high-@xmath0 superconductors indeed have flat regions on their fermi surfaces .",
    "hence , some of the results of this paper may be applicable to these materials .",
    "however , the primary goal of our study is to elucidate general theoretical concepts rather than to achieve detailed description of real materials .    in order to distinguish the new features brought into the problems by introducing higher dimensions , we present material in an inductive manner . in sec .",

    "precise relation is hard to establish because of the infinitesimal size of the patches , their different orientations , and uncertainties of connections between them . on the other hand , the bosonization procedure seems to be even better applicable to a flat fermi surface , which consists of a few big patches .",
    "mattis @xcite and hlubina @xcite followed that logic and claimed that the flat fermi surface model is exactly solvable by the bosonization and represents a luttinger liquid .",
    "the discrepancy between this claim and the results our paper indicates that some conditions must restrict the validity of the bosonization approximations .",
    "luther gave a more sophisticated treatment to the flat fermi surface problem by mapping it onto multiple quantum chains @xcite .",

    "the harmonic terms can be readily diagonalized , but the exponential terms require a consistent renormalization - group treatment . if the renormalization - group equations were derived in the bosonization scheme of @xcite , they would be the same as the parquet equations written in our paper , because the renormalization - group equations do not depend on whether the boson or fermion representation is used in their derivation @xcite .",
    "long time ago , luther bosonized noninteracting electrons on a curved fermi surface @xcite ; however , the interaction between the electrons remained intractable because of the exponential terms .",
    "the recent bosonization in higher dimensions @xcite managed to reformulate the problem in the harmonic terms only .",
    "this is certainly sufficient to reproduces the landau description of sound excitations in a fermi liquid @xcite ; however , it may be not sufficient to derive the electron correlation functions .",
    "the validity of the harmonic approximation is hard to trace for a curved fermi surface , but considerable experience has been accumulated for the flat fermi surface models .    in the model of multiple 1d chains without single - electron tunneling between the chains and with forward scattering between different chains , the bosonization produces the harmonic terms only , thus the model can be solved exactly @xcite .",
    "however , a slight modification of the model by introducing backward scattering between different chains @xcite or interaction between four different chains @xcite adds the exponential terms , which destroy the exact solvability and typically lead to a cdw or sdw instability .",
    "even if no instability occurs , as in the model of electrons in a high magnetic field @xcite , the fast parquet method shows that the electron correlation functions have a complicated , nonpower structure , which is impossible to obtain within the harmonic bosonization .",

    "<S> we study instabilities occurring in the electron system whose fermi surface has flat regions on its opposite sides . </S>",
    "<S> such a fermi surface resembles fermi surfaces of some high-@xmath0 superconductors . in the framework of the parquet approximation , we classify possible instabilities and derive renormalization - group equations that determine the evolution of corresponding susceptibilities with decreasing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> numerical solutions of the parquet equations are found to be in qualitative agreement with a ladder approximation . </S>",
    "<S> for the repulsive hubbard interaction , the antiferromagnetic ( spin - density - wave ) instability dominates , but when the fermi surface is not perfectly flat , the @xmath1-wave superconducting instability takes over . </S>"
