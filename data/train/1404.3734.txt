    "changes of the berry phase of the conduction electrons in metals reflect sensitively the topology of adiabatic changes of their spin orientation .",
    "these berry phases can be described by emergent ( fictitious ) aharonov - bohm magnetic fields @xmath2 which control the quasiclassical motion of electrons in phase space . as the aharonov - bohm fields cause",
    "a deflection of the trajectory in the plane perpendicular to the field , they lead to a hall signal . two limits of this berry - phase deflection may be distinguished @xcite .    on the one hand ,",
    "spin - orbit coupling and local electric fields varying on an atomic length scale may lead to a band structure where the spin orientation depends on its momentum .",
    "the resulting berry phases can be described by an emergent magnetic field which acts , however , not in position but in momentum space . in this case ,",
    "an anomalous contribution to the hall conductivity @xmath3 arises in terms of dissipationless hall currents , which reflect differences of the berry phase collected by majority and minority charge carriers . in the simplest scenario ,",
    "@xmath3 scales with the uniform spin polarization .",
    "this is referred to as the _ intrinsic anomalous _ hall effect since @xmath3 turns out to be independent of impurity scattering . in turn",
    ", this implies that the corresponding hall resistivity @xmath4 is proportional to the square of the longitudinal resistivity , @xmath5 , where we assumed @xmath6 as for most good metals .    on the other hand , smoothly varying magnetic textures , which change their spin orientation on length scales much longer than the fermi wavelength , give rise to berry phases picked up in real space .",
    "the corresponding emergent magnetic field acts similar to a real magnetic field .",
    "this effect may be described in terms of quasiparticles supporting emergent charges with the important difference that majority and minority electrons carry opposite emergent charges ( a technical description follows ) . as for smooth magnetic textures ,",
    "the real - space berry phases are directly associated to the real - space winding of the magnetization , the corresponding contribution to the hall effect is then referred to as the _ topological _ hall resistivity , @xmath7 .",
    "as for the conventional hall effect , @xmath7 is approximately independent of the total scattering rate . in multiband systems , however , the relative strength of scattering rates determines the relative size of contributions from the various bands and therefore also the size of @xmath7 .",
    "the concepts of real- and momentum - space berry phases may also be generalized to berry phases in phase space @xcite .",
    "these arise when the local direction of the electron spin is governed both by spin - orbit coupling in the bands and by smooth magnetic textures .",
    "their importance in real materials is essentially unexplored .",
    "an increasing number of experimental studies support the existence of the intrinsic anomalous hall effect @xcite . a vital piece of evidence is thereby related to the temperature dependence of the hall conductivity , which scales with the magnetization .",
    "in turn , the intrinsic anomalous hall resistivity vanishes for @xmath8 in high - purity metals with low residual resistivities as @xmath9 .",
    "this is contrasted by the temperature and field dependence of the topological hall resistivity , which is approximately independent of the elastic scattering rate . as minority and majority electrons",
    "carry opposite emergent charges , the topological hall resistivity is thereby sensitive to the strength of the local magnetization . since the difference in density of minority and majority electrons also decreases with increasing temperature , @xmath7",
    "may therefore be expected to decrease with increasing temperature in materials with a well - defined nonzero topological winding number per magnetic unit cell .",
    "qualitatively , the temperature dependence caused by the local magnetization may be enhanced by spin - flip scattering , which prohibits that the electrons follow the magnetic texture adiabatically .",
    "since spin - flip scattering typically increases with increasing temperature the topological hall signal may therefore decrease even faster than expected from the temperature dependence of the difference of majority and minority charge carriers alone .",
    "numerous experimental studies have addressed the existence of topological hall contributions .",
    "however , their identification has been ambiguous , especially in the absence of topological quantization , i.e. , nonzero topological winding of the spin structure per magnetic unit cell .",
    "for instance , in a seminal paper , a topological hall signal has been reported for three - dimensional pyrochlore lattices @xcite . yet , in these systems the noncoplanar spin structure is due to geometric frustration on short length scales , which thus can not be described as a smoothly varying structure in position space . moreover ,",
    "the topological hall effect is not related to a nonzero topological winding number per magnetic unit cell .",
    "recently , an analogous study reported a large topological hall signal for geometrically frustrated noncoliniear spin order in ucu@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "likewise , a topological hall signal has also been considered , e.g. , in la@xmath11co@xmath12mno@xmath13 @xcite , cro@xmath14 @xcite , and gd @xcite . yet , for these systems there is essentially no independent microscopic information on the relevant spin structures .",
    "a new generation of experimental studies of the topological hall effect has become possible with the discovery of lattices of magnetic whirl lines , so - called skyrmions , in chiral magnets such as mnsi , described in further detail in sec.[mnsi ] .",
    "the skyrmion lattice represents the first example of long - range magnetic order with a well - defined nonzero topological winding number per magnetic unit cell . measurements of the hall effect have indeed revealed a contribution to the hall signal , which appeared to be switched on and off when entering or leaving the skyrmion phase , respectively @xcite .",
    "this was attributed to the topological hall effect . in a pioneering high - pressure study of lee and co - workers @xcite , the existence of a tenfold larger , hitherto unexplained ,",
    "topological hall signal was reported above 6kbar , where no data was shown between ambient pressure and 6kbar .",
    "the main goal of the work reported in our paper is to clarify how the large signal reported in ref.@xcite is related to the magnetic phase diagram of mnsi and the skyrmion lattice phase at ambient pressure and which factors determine the size of the hall signal .",
    "clarification of the origin of the large topological hall signal observed in mnsi under pressure provides an important point of reference for a wide range of problems .",
    "first , recent experiments have identified the effects of spin - transfer torques in the skyrmion lattice of mnsi at tiny electric current densities @xcite . here",
    ", the size of the topological hall signal reflects the strength of the coupling between the electric currents and the spin structure .",
    "thus , understanding the size of the topological hall effect promises major advances in the understanding of the origin of spin - transfer torques .",
    "second , the largest topological hall signals have so far been reported for mnge ( ref.@xcite ) and srfeo@xmath13 ( ref.@xcite ) , reaching up to @xmath15 .",
    "it has been speculated that this provides evidence for aharanov - bohm fields up to many hundred tesla .",
    "if correct , this might pave the way to a completely new generation of phenomena in which even larger emergent fields approach the quantum limit .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to gain an understanding as to what determines the quantitative size of the topological hall signal and whether the generic size of the topological hall effect may be even much larger .",
    "third , understanding the topological hall signals in skyrmion lattices and related structures will also shed new light on the large number of more conventional materials in which topological hall effects have been claimed .    .",

    "for ease of reading , we summarize in figs.[figure7 ] and [ figure10 ] our main results consisting in the evolution of the magnetic phase diagram and the topological hall signal as a function of pressure , respectively .",
    "regimes in the magnetic phase diagrams , where we observe a topological hall signal , are thereby shown in red shading , where dark red shading refers to reversible behavior in field sweeps as well as zero - field cooling and field cooling .",
    "an important aspect of our study is the additional discovery that the topological hall signal for pressures larger than ambient pressure survives under field cooling down to the lowest temperatures .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[figure7 ] by light red shading .",
    "based on the dependence on field and temperature history , we obtain an estimate of the size of the topological hall signal and its pressure dependence in the zero - temperature limit as shown in fig.[figure10 ] . here , full symbols represent the maximum topological hall contribution observed in field sweeps slightly below @xmath16 .",
    "open symbols represent a metastable topological hall contribution under field cooling for temperatures of 2k , the lowest temperature measured , i.e. , the topological hall signal without the degrading effects of finite temperatures . taken together , our study establishes that the emergence of a giant generic topological hall signal under pressure is connected with the skyrmion lattice phase at ambient pressure .",
    "we thereby identify pressure inhomogeneities and mediocre sample quality [ low residual resistivity ratios ( rrrs ) ] as important factors that influenced previous high - pressure studies .",
    "we further identify that temperature is an important factor affecting the size of the topological hall signal and discuss various mechanisms which explain its strong variation with pressure .",

    "the itinerant - electron magnet mnsi is ideally suited to pursue the question of the generic size of the topological hall resistivity in a real material . in the noncentrosymmetric cubic @xmath17 crystal structure , space group @xmath18",
    ", three hierarchical energy scales account for the magnetic properties @xcite . a competition between ferromagnetic exchange and dzyaloshinsky - moriya interactions on the strongest and second strongest scales ,",
    "respectively , generates a long - wavelength helimagnetic modulation , @xmath19 , below @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the helical modulation propagates along the cubic space diagonal @xmath21 due to magnetic anisotropies by higher - order spin - orbit coupling providing the weakest scale .    of particular interest is the magnetic phase diagram of mnsi .",
    "below @xmath22 and as a function of increasing magnetic field , the helimagnetic order undergoes a reorientation transition at a field @xmath23 into a spin - flop phase also known as conical phase . depending on field direction ,",
    "this reorientation is either a crossover or a symmetry - breaking second - order phase transition .",
    "when further increasing the field , a second transition takes place from the conical phase to a spin polarized ( ferromagnetic ) state at @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "finally , in the vicinity of @xmath22 , a small additional phase pocket exists within the conical phase , historically referred to as the a phase @xcite . although the a phase had been known for a long time , the underlying spin structure was only recently identified , providing the first example of long - range magnetic order in which each magnetic unit cell supports a nonzero topological winding number @xcite .",
    "the skyrmions may be visualized as a kind of vortex lines that stabilize parallel to the applied magnetic field .",
    "the topological winding number supported by the skyrmion lattice may be determined by integrating the winding density over the two - dimensional magnetic unit cell ( uc ) : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 . here",
    ", @xmath27 is the antisymmetric unit tensor and @xmath28 the magnetic unit vector @xcite . for the case of the skyrmion lattice in mnsi",
    ", a winding number @xmath29 per magnetic unit cell is obtained .",
    "thus , in contrast to some of the noncollinear magnetic structures in geometrically frustrated magnets , where the winding senses are staggered causing cancellations of topological contributions to the hall resistivity , no such cancellations occur in the skyrmion lattice of chiral magnets since the topological winding is quantized and nonzero per magnetic unit cell .",
    "measurements of the hall effect in mnsi have revealed three contributions : first , the normal hall effect @xmath30 , which is proportional to the applied magnetic field @xmath31 ; second , an intrinsic anomalous hall conductivity , @xmath32 , below the helimagnetic transition temperature , @xmath33 , which scales with the magnetization @xmath34 @xcite ; third , a topological hall signal , @xmath7 , in the regime of the skyrmion lattice phase , which reflects the nonzero topological winding number of the spin structure . assuming the absence of intraband ( spin - flip ) scattering and that the interband ( non - spin - flip ) scattering may be captured by the normal hall constant @xmath35 , an estimate of @xmath7 has been given by @xmath36 .",
    "here , @xmath37 is the charge carrier spin polarization , and @xmath2 the emergent aharonov - bohm field associated with the berry phase arising from the topological winding of the texture @xcite ( see sec.[theory ] for an account of the considerations entering this formula and for a precise definition of @xmath37 ) .",
    "the emergent magnetic field per magnetic unit cell is thereby topologically quantized @xcite : its average strength is given by one flux quantum per magnetic unit cell times the winding number ( see sec.[theory ] ) .",
    "for a quantitative estimate , we note that the skyrmion lattice is hexagonal , similar to the vortex lattice in type - ii superconductors .",
    "hence , the reciprocal and real - space lattice vectors of the skyrmion lattice have length @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , where @xmath40 corresponds approximately to the wavelength of the helical state near @xmath22 , @xmath41",
    "the size of the unit cell is in turn given by @xmath42 and one obtains for mnsi @xmath43 the sign thereby reflects the winding number of @xmath44 , implying that the emergent field @xmath2 is oriented _ antiparallel _ to the physical magnetic field .    we note that the same expression for @xmath2 of minus one flux quantum per unit cell was used in ref .",
    "however , due to an unfortunate calculational mistake , a five times smaller value for @xmath45 was stated in this paper @xcite .",
    "the experimentally observed  @xcite contribution @xmath46 is hence approximately a factor of 5 smaller than the theoretically estimated value inferred from the simple expression @xmath36 , when one uses @xmath47 and @xmath48 as in ref .",
    "@xcite . both @xmath37 and @xmath35",
    "thereby yield considerable uncertainties . as discussed in sec.[theory ] , @xmath37 depends on a complicated fermi - surface average , while the value of @xmath35 is difficult to extract in the relevant parameter regime due to a huge anomalous hall contribution .",
    "for example , the normal hall constant @xmath35 , given above , which was used for the estimate in ref.@xcite , was inferred from the hall signal at room temperature , while a simultaneous fit of the normal and anomalous hall signal at low temperatures suggests @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , contrary to the conclusions of ref.@xcite , the value of @xmath7 observed experimentally is , in fact , much smaller than the theoretical prediction .",
    "this may be explained , in principle , by several mechanisms discussed in detail below , which were not considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "the detailed pressure dependence of the helimagnetic properties of mnsi offer a fresh perspective as concerns the origin and the size of the topological hall signal . in a pioneering study , lee _",
    "et al . _ reported a topological hall signal for hydrostatic pressures in the range 6 to 12kbar ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) that seemed puzzling in two ways . first",
    ", the signal was very large , @xmath50 .",
    "such a tenfold larger signal either requires a drastic reduction of the skyrmion lattice spacing by over a factor of 3 , or a tenfold increase of the conduction spin polarization @xmath37 or a tendfold increase of the normal hall constant @xmath35 ( or a highly unusual combination of these aspects ) .",
    "second , the field range of this very large topological hall signal extended all the way from @xmath51 to @xmath52 and did not correspond to the range over which a skyrmion lattice phase may be expected based on the phase diagram at ambient pressure .",
    "the results reported by lee _",
    "_ @xcite and their relationship to the magnetic phase diagram at ambient pressure seemed also surprising in view of the very detailed high - pressure studies of mnsi reported in the literature .",
    "these comprise measurements of the resistivity @xcite , ac susceptibility @xcite , magnetization @xcite , thermal expansion @xcite , thermopower @xcite , neutron scattering @xcite , nmr @xcite , and @xmath53-sr @xcite .",
    "they may be summarized as follows @xcite . with increasing pressure",
    ", the helimagnetic transition temperature measured in the resistivity , ac susceptibility , and magnetization decreases and vanishes around @xmath54 .",
    "the temperature - versus - pressure phase diagram displays considerable complexities for @xmath55 .",
    "for instance , the helimagnetic transition turns distinctly first order , where the appearance of itinerant metamagnetism under applied magnetic fields provides the most striking evidence .",
    "neutron scattering , @xmath53-sr , and nmr suggest phase separation of the magnetic order for @xmath55 , where a decreasing volume fraction of helimagnetic order tracks @xmath56 as inferred from the resistivity and ac susceptibility .",
    "a major puzzle surrounds the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity which displays a @xmath57 non - fermi - liquid form for @xmath58 in the regime where the helimagnetic order has been suppressed , namely @xmath59 .",
    "the non - fermi - liquid resistivity thereby survives up to pressures of at least @xmath60 , contrasting the expectations of a conventional quantum critical point .",
    "neutron scattering moreover shows the presence of a peculiar magnetic scattering intensity on the surface of a small sphere in reciprocal space at a wavelength of the helical modulation . by analogy with liquid crystals ,",
    "this scattering pattern has been referred to as partial order .",
    "as the partial order extends deep into the nfl regime without signs of phase transitions , it appears to be the signature of a spin liquid , possibly with nontrivial topological character .",
    "regarding the possible origin of the very large topological hall signal , reported in the pressure range from 6 to 12kbar , studies reported in the literature provide the following key information .",
    "first , the wavelength of the helical modulation is essentially unchanged as a function of pressure .",
    "this implies that a skyrmion lattice phase associated with the helimagnetic state , like that at ambient pressure , has an unchanged lattice constant , i.e. , @xmath2 remains essentially unchanged under pressure .",
    "second , the ordered magnetic moment in the helimagnetic state decreases gently by @xmath61 up to 12kbar ( it certainly does not increase ) . since the curie - weiss moment in the paramagnetic state is also unchanged , the polarization @xmath37 of the electron bands does not appear to change drastically .",
    "third , neither the electrical resistivity , which is well behaved , nor the normal hall effect , as inferred from the data shown by lee _",
    "_ suggest a change of @xmath35 as a function of pressure ( lee _ et al . _",
    "do not comment on the pressure dependence of @xmath35 ) . finally , the critical fields @xmath51 and @xmath52 do not change under pressure , consistent with the unchanged helical modulation . hence , the phase boundaries of the skyrmion lattice phase should be unchanged . in turn , the size and the field range of the topological hall signal reported by lee _ et al . _",
    "either represents a completely novel phenomenon or an unexpected conspiracy of mechanisms , both of which are of great interest .    in order to identify the generic size of the topological hall signal in a well - known material ,",
    "we have revisited the pressure dependence of mnsi reported in ref.@xcite and its seeming inconsistencies with the topological hall signal at ambient pressure @xcite . in the study",
    "reported here we present data up to @xmath62 , avoiding the complexities associated with the first - order transition , itinerant metamagnetism , phase coexistence , partial magnetic order , and extended non - fermi - liquid resistivity .",
    "as all of these aspects are beyond the scope of the work presented here , hall effect measurements above @xmath63 will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the pressure dependence of the magnetotransport properties was studied down to 1.5k under magnetic fields up to 14 t with an oxford instruments variable temperature insert ( vti ) as combined with a superconducting magnet system .",
    "the temperature of the sample was monitored with a calibrated cernox sensor , closely attached to the pressure cell .",
    "the magnetoresistance and the hall voltage of the mnsi samples were measured simultaneously in a conventional six - terminal configuration using standard digital lock - in technology .",
    "impedance matching low - noise signal transformer were used to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "low excitation currents and frequencies were used to avoid resistive heating and parasitic signal pickup , respectively .",
    "field sweeps were recorded for increasing and decreasing fields ; temperature sweeps were recorded at positive and negative field values .",
    "this permitted to subtract longitudinal voltage components of the transverse contacts due to unavoidable contact misalignment by antisymmetrizing the transverse voltage pickup .",
    "vice versa , transverse signal components at the longitudinal voltage contacts were corrected by symmetrizing the signal .",
    "we note that the result of the antisymmetrization / symmetrization procedure , by design , is a single field dependence from negative to positive field .",
    "the sign of the hall signal was checked very carefully @xcite . in the following ,",
    "the antisymmetric transverse signal is referred to as @xmath4 and the symmetric longitudinal signal is referred to as @xmath64 .",
    "the single crystals studied were grown by optical float - zoning under ultrahigh vacuum ( uhv ) compatible conditions @xcite .",
    "typical residual resistivity ratios ( rrr ) of our samples were in the range 40 to 300 .",
    "the origin of the different rrrs can thereby be associated with the precise starting composition before float - zoning as determined in a careful systematic study to be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the differences we observe in the magnetotransport properties may be grouped into low - quality mnsi with low rrrs around @xmath65 and high - quality mnsi with rrrs above @xmath66 .",
    "the latter allow to connect the topological hall effect under pressure with the skyrmion lattice phase ( the a phase ) at ambient pressure as described in the main part of our paper .    in our transport measurements ,",
    "platelet - shaped samples were studied with typical dimensions 2.8 mm long , 1 mm wide and less than 0.2 mm thick .",
    "they were oriented such that the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the platelet and parallel to @xmath67 .",
    "we have chosen this direction since neutron scattering under pressure shows that the easy axis of mnsi remains unchanged along @xmath21 up to @xmath6812kbar @xcite , the @xmath67 axis is neither a magnetically hard nor soft axis for the pressure range studied , i.e. , the crystallographic orientation is not distinct in any way .",
    "electric currents were applied either along a @xmath69 or @xmath67 .",
    "the effects of demagnetizing fields were corrected by approximating the sample shape with a rectangular prism @xcite .",
    "conventional nonmagnetic cu : be clamp cells were used to study the pressure dependence of the magnetotransport properties . for the transport measurements ,",
    "eight pressure cells were assembled .",
    "a detailed list of the pressure cells and pressures is given in table[table : samples ] , where only pressures relevant to the work reported here are listed .",
    "the applied pressure was inferred from the combination of the superconducting transition of sn measured resistively as well as a comparison of the helimagnetic transition temperature of mnsi with previous studies . for all pressure points investigated , we recorded at first the resistivity as a function of temperature at @xmath70 ( data is not shown to safe space and because they are perfectly consistent with all previous studies ) .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath16 referred to in the following was thereby determined from @xmath64 consistent with all previous studies .",
    "further details of the temperature dependence will be addressed in sec.[results ] .",

    "pt wires ( diameter 0.025 mm ) were spot welded to the sample providing tiny , nonsuperconducting voltage contacts .",

    "also visible in this picture is the sn sample used to determine the pressure ( for better visibility it was slightly bent to the side ) .",
    "the geometry factors used for calculating @xmath64 and @xmath4 were at first determined with a light microscope . to account for small systematic differences between samples and to permit better comparison of data recorded for different samples",
    ", we adjusted the longitudinal resistivity at 35k to the pressure dependence determined in ref.@xcite , @xmath86 . likewise",
    ", we adjusted the geometry factor used for the hall data by virtue of a comparison with data recorded with two pressure cells over the full pressure range at a field of 13.5 t and a temperature of 2.8k , notably @xmath87 .",
    "the adjustments were no larger then 10% .    to ensure ideal pressure conditions ,",
    "the majority of our experiments were carried out with a 4:1 methanol : ethanol mixture as pressure transmitter , reported to provide the best pressure homogeneity in the pressure range of interest as compared with other organic liquids @xcite .",
    "data recorded with the methanol : ethanol pressure transmitter is labelled me .",
    "in addition , we performed a few experiments with a 1:1 mixture of fluorinert fc72 and fc84 as pressure transmitter , denoted by fi .",
    "this mixture has been reported to provide , in principle , fairly uniform pressure conditions up to 15kbar @xcite . however , as summarized in fig.[figure8 ] , we find discrepancies consistent with local strains in the fluorinert pressure transmitter as compared with data recorded with methanol : ethanol .",
    "in fact , it is important to note that a single - component fluorinert ( fc77 ) was used in previous magnetotransport studies in mnsi under pressure @xcite , which is known to provide even less uniform pressure conditions .    in our studies we found that the topological hall signal varied sensitively with the cooling procedure .",
    "following careful tests , the largest topological hall signal was systematically observed under two conditions : first , cooling the pressure cells from room temperature , and second , cooling at sufficiently slow cooling rates between 200 and 100k , which covers the solidification temperature of the methanol : ethanol mixture .",
    "in fact , this observation was insensitive to the pressure transmitters we tested .",
    "we have therefore systematically recorded all data presented in this paper after initially cooling the sample from room temperature with a rate of 1k / min between 200 and 100k .",
    "we presume that this procedure minimizes local strains that arise otherwise from the solidification of the pressure transmitter .",
    "typical data illustrating the sensitivity to the cooling procedure are shown in fig.[figure0 ] , where data recorded after cooling from room temperature are marked ( * * ) and data recorded after heating to 250k followed by cooling from 250k are marked with ( * ) .",
    "data of one sequence shown in fig.[figure0 ] consisted in cooling the cell always at 1k / min , first from room temperature , second from 250k after heating the cell up from 2k , and third again from room temperature having cooled the cell to 2k again .",
    "data of the other sequence shown in fig.[figure0 ] were recorded after the cell was heated to 250k , but the subsequent cooling was done at three different rates of 0.5 , 2 , and 3k / min , respectively .",

    "fig.[figure2 ] ) . in comparison ,",
    "data reported in ref.@xcite , where the top - hat - shaped topological contribution was observed all the way up to @xmath52 , were recorded with a single - component fluorinert pressure transmitter .",
    "we finally turn to the hall signal outside the field range of the top - hat contribution ( i.e. , outside of the skyrmion phase ) .",
    "this part of the hall signal varies strongly with pressure for the high - quality sample , while it changes only weakly for the low - quality sample as shown in figs.[figure3](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "since the data shown in these figures were recorded at the same reduced temperature below @xmath16 , and @xmath16 decreases by a factor of 2 between @xmath101 and 12kbar , the decrease of the hall signal outside the field range of the top - hat contribution is essentially a consequence of the decrease of @xmath64 with decreasing @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the non - top - hat part of the hall signal is characteristic of a normal plus an ( intrinsic ) anomalous hall signal .",
    "the difference between the topological and anomalous contribution to the hall signal is strongly supported by the magnetization as a function of magnetic field , shown in fig.[figure3](c ) for various pressures at a temperature 5% below @xmath16 . with increasing pressure and thus decreasing @xmath16 ,",
    "the magnetization is slightly reduced , while the magnetic field dependence changes very little qualitatively .",
    "the non - top - hat part of the hall signal therefore qualitatively tracks the magnetization as expected of a dominant anomalous hall contribution .",

    "in fact , in the field range of the large topological hall signal , the magnetization decreases @xmath103 with increasing pressure .",
    "this suggests strongly that the large topological hall signal is not connected with changes of the local spin polarization .",

    "we are thereby empirically able to attribute the extended field region where a topological hall signal was found in previous studies under pressure , and which appeared to be inconsistent with the field region of the topological hall signal at ambient pressure , to a combination of sample quality and anisotropic pressure conditions .",
    "the role of sample quality , discussed in more detail in the next section , suggests that the pinning due to disorder and/or pressure inhomogeneities and local uniaxial strain arising due to local difference in the compressibility strongly affect the field and temperature range where the top - hat hall contribution is observed .",
    "while the ( meta)stability of the corresponding phase is strongly affected , the magnitude of this signal is rather insensitive to sample quality ( a more detailed discussion of the signal size will be presented in the following ) .",

    "however , for magnetic fields in the range of the top - hat contribution , the hall signal for fc / fh retains a large value below the broad maximum , while the data recorded under zfc / fh decreases below the broad maximum .",
    "the difference suggests that the top - hat hall signal survives under field cooling as a metastable state down to the lowest temperatures .",
    "this is consistent with the picture that once the sample has been prepared in the skyrmion lattice phase , thermal fluctuations are not successful to unwind the magnetic structure , which therefore remains as a metastable state ( see sec.[phasediagram ] below ) .    trying various other combinations of field and temperature histories , we find no other possibility to prepare a similarly large hall signal at the lowest temperatures as compared with field cooling .",
    "interestingly , however , similar metastable behavior has been observed in small - angle neutron scattering studies of the skyrmion lattice phase in fe@xmath11co@xmath105si @xcite .",
    "typical data illustrating the metastable temperature dependence at various pressures are shown in fig.[figure4 ] for two different sample qualities at a field of 0.25 t . for pressures exceeding several kbar ,",
    "the metastable behavior emerges .",
    "when field cooling ( fc ) at a slow rate in the field range of the skyrmion lattice phase , @xmath4 increases for decreasing temperature with a maximum just above @xmath16 , typically retaining a high value down to the lowest temperatures measured [ figs.[figure4](a ) and ( d ) ] .",

    "increases in size , the only truly different property with respect to ambient pressure concerns the metastable behavior we observed under field cooling .",
    "this metastable behavior is indicated in the phase diagrams in terms of a light red shading extending down to the lowest temperatures studied .",

    "this is followed by a discussion of the consistency of the experimental results with the theoretical description .",
    "as emphasized in the introduction , the intrinsic anomalous hall effect arises from berry phases which an electron picks up when moving in momentum space , while the motion of the electron in the presence of a smooth magnetic texture is described by real - space berry phases . in the following , we present a rather qualitative introduction of these effects .",

    "the electron spins are aligned parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field .",
    "second , spin - orbit coupling in addition leads to a splitting of bands and the orientation of the spin becomes locked to its momentum . for weak spin - orbit coupling and smooth magnetic textures ( as in mnsi )",

    "therefore , the spin ( magnetic moment ) of an electron orients preferentially antiparallel ( parallel ) to the zeeman field , respectively .    in the semiclassical limit , this allows to define the direction of the local magnetization @xmath121 , which is a function defined in the six - dimensional phase space comprising both position and momentum @xmath122 here , we consider only situations , where as in mnsi the exchange fields vary on length scales much longer than the fermi wave length .",

    "it is important to note that increasing pressure corresponds to decreasing @xmath16 and thus decreasing absolute temperatures at which this signal is determined .",
    "the increase of @xmath104 with pressure hence corresponds also to an increase with decreasing temperature .    to obtain an estimate of the generic value of the topological hall signal in the low - temperature limit",

    "we begin with the emergent field @xmath144 . for low temperatures and deep in the ordered phase",

    "the value of the emergent magnetic field is therefore essentially unchanged , @xmath190 - 13.15 t [ cf .",
    "( [ beff ] ) ] @xcite .",
    "we address next the pressure dependence of the normal hall constant @xmath35 . a value of @xmath35 at low temperatures and high magnetic fields inferred from the experimental data is shown in fig .  [ figure10](b ) .",

    "a much more difficult question concerns variations of the normal hall constant under changes of the size of the local magnetization at small fields and/or temperatures in the vicinity of @xmath22 . due to the large size of the anomalous hall contribution , a reliable experimental determination of the normal hall constant proves to be very difficult in this regime .",
    "more importantly , perhaps , the rather smooth field dependence observed experimentally does not indicate any particular complexities .",
    "in contrast , nonrelativistic band - structure calculations @xcite suggest that the local magnetization may be accounted for by a rigid shift of minority versus majority bands as the local magnetization increases .",
    "moreover , the calculated band structure suggests that the topology , shape , size , and sign of the effective masses of the minority and majority fermi surfaces in mnsi change strongly when the magnetization increases from @xmath163 to @xmath191 , the size of the ordered moment at low @xmath192 .",
    "extensive de haas - van alphen measurements by brown @xcite support this view as they reproduce in remarkable detail the experimentally observed fermi surfaces at large magnetic fields .",
    "we therefore conclude that on the one hand , @xmath35 at fixed magnetization depends weakly on pressure .",
    "however , we can not rule out definitively sizeable changes of @xmath35 for small values of the magnetization close to the transition temperature .    the remaining factor in eq .",
    "( [ rhoxy ] ) to be addressed is the fermi - surface average of the emergent charge @xmath189 .",
    "as @xmath177 is of opposite sign for majority and minority spins , it may be expected to scale linearly with the strength of the local spin polarization in the absence of strong changes in the band structure , discussed in the following .",
    "shown by the straight line in fig.[figure10](a ) is a linear regression of the open symbols .",
    "the slope of this line corresponds to the relative pressure dependence of the magnetization @xmath193 with @xmath194 , as extrapolated for zero field from fields above @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "this rate of decrease is also consistent with the decrease of the ordered magnetic moment inferred from sans @xcite .",
    "the rate of decrease of @xmath104 with increasing pressure hence follows _ quantitatively _ the pressure dependence of the spin polarization as expected from eq .",

    "this is a reasonable value which is of the same order of magnitude as the ratio @xmath200 of the local magnetization ( about @xmath201 ) and the nominal saturation moment of the mn ions ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "taking into account the complicated fermi - surface averages determining @xmath37 and the complex band structure of mnsi @xcite , this shows that the large signal at low temperatures and finite pressure can naturally be explained by the topological hall effect arising from the skyrmion lattice .",
    "the remaining question concerns the reduction of the topological signal at higher temperatures and , most importantly , the nature of the reduction of the signal size by about a factor @xmath203 at ambient pressure close to @xmath22 . here",
    ", one important factor is the reduction of the ordered moment ( and therefore of @xmath37 ) when the temperature increases . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was originally estimated that at ambient pressure the local polarization @xmath204 is only a factor @xmath205 smaller than at @xmath206 . while quantitative measurements of the size of the ordered moment in the skyrmion phase at ambient and high pressure are presently not available due to subtle extinction effects , it is plausible that the reduction of the magnetization under pressure explains the decrease of the topological hall signal with increasing pressure .    yet , even though the reduction of @xmath207 close to @xmath22 at ambient pressure was probably underestimated in ref .",
    "@xcite , we do not think that the linear dependence of @xmath208 on @xmath207 fully explains the order - of - magnitude reduction of the topological hall signal .",
    "taking into account that an abundance of particle - hole excitations characteristic of the itinerant - electron magnetism of mnsi has been inferred from polarized neutron scattering @xcite as well as the temperature dependence of the damping of magnetic resonance data @xcite , five mechanisms and combinations thereof may be at the heart of this reduction .",
    "first , as explained above , without the effects of scattering , one expects from band - structure calculations strong changes of the fermi surface for variations at small values of the local magnetizations .",
    "this would modify @xmath35 and also the fermi - surface averages @xmath208 .",
    "second , close to @xmath22 , the relevant scattering processes may be completely different compared to the low - temperature situation . this can also strongly affect the fermi - surface average @xmath208 as different fermi surfaces are weighted by the square of the scattering time .",
    "third , as the exchange splitting close to @xmath22 is weak , it is possible that the spin - orbit splitting of the bands prohibits that the electron spin follows fully the magnetic texture . as shown in eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) , a possible consequence is that for some of the bands the topological contribution is completely switched off !",
    "it is also possible that only a part of a given fermi surface is affected by the real - space berry phase , while for other parts the emergent magnetic flux vanishes .",
    "fourth , it is possible that close to @xmath22 the adiabatic approximation breaks down .",
    "especially , if the spin - flip scattering length describing the scattering from minority to majority electrons ( and vice versa ) is smaller than the distance of the skyrmions , the topological hall signal will become strongly suppressed .",
    "it is possible that the third and forth mechanisms are related .",
    "namely , when spin - orbit splitting and exchange splitting are of similar magnitude , the splitting of majority and minority bands vanishes on three - dimensional planes in the six - dimensional phase space which may give rise to enhanced spin - flip scattering .",
    "fifth and final , when spin - orbit and exchange splitting are of similar magnitude , one can not neglect the fact that aside from the real - space berry phases , also the intrinsic anomalous hall effect , caused by momentum - space berry phases , is affected by the presence of the skyrmions and even new phase - space berry phases emerge .",
    "these effects will be studied in the future . at present , neither the size nor the sign of these extra contributions",
    "are known theoretically or experimentally .",
    "most likely a combination of several of the effects described above is responsible for the strong reduction of the topological hall contribution at ambient pressure .",
    "however , the experiments under pressure and the theoretical analysis show unambiguously that the giant low - temperature value of the topological signal is robustly given by a value of the order of 50 n@xmath209 cm , which depends only weakly on sample quality and pressure .",
    "in conclusion , we reported comprehensive measurements of the hall effect in mnsi at low temperatures and high pressures across the magnetic phase diagram that reveal a large generic topological hall signal .",
    "exploring carefully the importance of the field and temperature history for the topological hall signal opens an unexpected route to determine its generic size .",
    "notably , tracking the topological hall signal under field cooling allows essentially to switch off the effects of finite temperatures .",
    "exploring the importance of the sample purity and pressure transmitter allows us to attribute the wide field range of the large topological hall signal reported by lee _",
    "@xcite to defect - induced pinning and pressure inhomogeneities .",
    "the field dependence observed in our study under improved experimental conditions thereby unambiguously links the large topological hall signal to the skyrmion lattice phase at ambient pressure .",
    "as the large topological hall signal clearly evolves under pressure out of the skyrmion lattice phase at ambient pressure , we can directly link it to the topological hall signal arising from the winding of magnetization characteristic for skyrmion textures .",
    "it increases by about a factor of @xmath203 from the small signal observed at ambient pressure close to @xmath22 whenever the skyrmion lattice phase is stabilized at lower temperatures .",
    "the reduction of the ambient pressure signal arises very likely from a combination of several factors where the substantial reduction of the local polarization close to @xmath22 and associated changes of the fermi surfaces are probably the most important ones .",
    "the size of the topological hall signal at low temperature is , as in the case of the normal hall effect , determined by how the scattering rates average over the various fermi surfaces in mnsi . taken together , the increase of the topological hall resistivity with increasing pressure ( and hence decreasing helimagnetic transition temperature ) arises clearly from a rather unusual combination of mechanisms .",
    "it is , nevertheless , fully compatible with the present understanding of the spin order and electronic properties of mnsi .",
