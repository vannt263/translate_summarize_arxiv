    "many systems , such as polymer chains and networks , proteins , glasses and charge - carriers in semiconductors are characterized by extremely slow relaxation processes .",
    "the microscopic mechanisms leading to such slow relaxations differ considerably from system to system , but their microscopic manifestations often correspond to power - laws .",
    "a recently introduced approach to slow relaxation in _ time - independent _ external fields is based on fractional fokker - planck equations ( ffpes ) @xcite or on fractional master equations @xcite .",
    "the ffpe describing subdiffusive behavior in an external field reads :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the pdf to find a particle ( walker ) at point @xmath2 at time @xmath3 . in eq.([subdiff ] ) @xmath4 is the fractional riemann - liouville operator ( @xmath5 ) defined through @xcite @xmath6 here @xmath7 can be associated with the time at which the system was prepared .",
    "furthermore , in eq.([subdiff ] ) @xmath8 is the fokker - planck operator , @xmath9 in what follows we concentrate on the case in which the acting force @xmath10 is homogeneous and of magnitude @xmath11 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath12 .    the fractional fokker - planck equation , eq.([subdiff ] )",
    ", has turned out to be useful in describing a broad range of phenomena connected with anomalous diffusion @xcite .",
    "there are essentially two main mechanisms leading to long - time memory in the behavior of complex systems .",
    "one is related to the hierarchical structure of the modes of the system , as is the case for polymer chains and networks @xcite and for rough interfaces @xcite .",
    "the other is associated with the diffusion in complex , ( almost ) quenched potential landscapes , which occur in glassy systems ( ranging from normal glasses to proteins ) .",
    "a phenomenological description of free relaxation ( i.e. the time - evolution of a system which is prepared in a nonequilibrium initial condition and then evolves under time - independent external conditions ) in terms of fractional fokker - planck equations is reasonable in both situations .",
    "thus , the ffpe , eq.([subdiff ] ) can be viewed as a phenomenological linear - response theory for a system with long memory in contact with a heat bath @xcite .",
    "this equation can be derived systematically from the continuous - time random walk ( ctrw ) scheme using the standard kramers - moyal procedure .",
    "the equivalence of the two approaches was discussed in @xcite using the subordination property of ctrws ; see also @xcite .",
    "thus , the free relaxation properties of a ctrw system are closely reproduced by eq.([subdiff ] ) and can be expressed in terms of mittag - leffler functions @xcite .    in what follows we concentrate on the response of the two models to _ time - dependent",
    "_ external fields , and discuss the mean current ( velocity ) and mean polarization ( coordinate ) as a function of time in systems under pulsed or sinusoidal external fields .",
    "we show that the linear response to time - dependent fields predicted by ffpe ( which is exactly the same as for hierarchical models ) differs strongly from what is expected under ctrw conditions .",
    "thus , the response to time - dependent fields of the systems described by ffpe is mainly influenced by the values of the field at times immediately preceding the observation time @xmath13 , while the memory of the earlier history fades out .",
    "on the other hand , in ctrw - systems the response of the current to external fields is local in time , while the corresponding susceptibility decays . in such systems",
    "the polarization depends much on the early history of the system .",
    "let us consider a system whose dynamics is described by a fractional fokker - planck equation and concentrate on the mean particles displacement under the action of an external force .",
    "this mean displacement @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 multiplying eq.([subdiff ] ) by @xmath2 and integrating it over the whole space we obtain : @xmath16 .",
    "\\label{part}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the left hand side of eq.([part ] ) is nothing but @xmath17 , whereas the right hand side can be simplified by integration by parts .",
    "since @xmath18 and its derivatives with respect to the coordinates vanish at infinity , the first integral vanishes and the second one is unity .",
    "hence @xmath19 note that such kind of response is typical for complex and hierarchically built systems , like polymer chains and networks , see @xcite .    as a simple example let us consider a chain of @xmath20 beads connected by harmonic springs and immersed in a viscous fluid ( a rouse - chain ) .",
    "we assume the first bead of the chain to be tagged ( say , charged ) and experience the external field @xmath11 .",
    "the motion of the beads is governed by the equation @xmath21 for the first bead ( bearing number 0 ) , @xmath22 for the last one and @xmath23 for all other beads , @xmath24 . in eqs.([bead0 ] ) to ( [ bead1 ] ) @xmath25 are gaussian , @xmath26-correlated forces with zero mean .",
    "note that due to the linearity of eqs.([bead0 ] ) to ( [ bead1 ] ) the mean positions and velocities of the beads ( averaged over the realizations of the @xmath27 ) follow equations similar in form , but where the random forces @xmath27 are omitted . let us suppose that the velocity response of the first bead of the chain ( averaged over the realizations of the random forces @xmath27 ) is described by the memory function @xmath28 .",
    "supposing that the initial mean velocities of the beads vanish , this leads after a laplace transformation to @xmath29 if @xmath30 is very large , @xmath31 , the chain can be considered as infinite ; then the subchain starting with bead 1 has the same linear response properties as the entire chain starting with bead 0 .",
    "thus , @xmath32 can be found using eq.([bead0 ] ) and noting that the equation of motion for bead 1 has the same form , eq.([lpl ] ) , with the acting force now being @xmath33 instead of @xmath11 .",
    "the laplace - representation of the equation of motion for the first bead reads : @xmath34 + { \\bf e}(\\lambda )   \\label{l0}\\ ] ] ( where we set @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "the analog of eq.([lpl ] ) for the velocity of the bead 1 reads : @xmath37 .",

    "thus , for @xmath39 , @xmath40 with @xmath41 , which is exactly the laplace - representation of a semi - derivative , @xmath42 with @xmath43 in eq.([fracder ] ) .",
    "this is the value which we will use in our numerical examples in what follows .    in the case where the friction coefficients @xmath44 and/or the spring constants @xmath45 differ from site to site , other values of @xmath46",
    "may be obtained @xcite .",
    "the same holds also for more complex ( higher - dimensional , fractal or tree - like ) structures . for example",
    ", the case when a tagged monomer is attached to a membrane corresponds to @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the linear response in the framework of the ctrw model introduced by montroll and weiss @xcite .",
    "this model was extremely successful in the explanation of dispersive transport in amorphous semiconductors @xcite ; see @xcite for reviews .",
    "as is usual in ctrw , we envisage an ensemble of noninteracting particles which may be influenced by external fields ( say , the particles are charged ) .",
    "the particles follow then ctrws , i.e. sequences of jumps .",
    "the time intervals @xmath48 between the jumps are uncorrelated . of interest",
    "are waiting times which follow power - law distributions , i.e. @xmath49 the physical motivation for such @xmath50-forms may be rationalized using random traps whose energy distribution is exponential @xcite . in what follows we put @xmath51 and work in dimensionless time units .",
    "a basic quantity in the ctrw formalism is @xmath52 , the probability to make exactly @xmath53 steps up to time @xmath13 . in the standard ,",
    "decoupled ctrw picture ( in which the spatial transition probabilities between the lattice sites are independent of the waiting - times ) under time - independent field the probability distribution @xmath18 of finding a particle at @xmath54 at time @xmath13 given that is started at @xmath55 at time 0 obeys @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the probability to reach @xmath58 from @xmath55 in @xmath53 steps .",
    "we note that eq.([green ] ) states that the ctrw is a random process subordinated to simple random walks under the operational time given by the @xmath52-distribution .",
    "note that exactly this property is the starting point for the derivation of ffpe in ref .",
    "let us now turn to the case of _ time - dependent _ fields . in this case",
    "the simple subordination relation , eq.([green ] ) breaks down , since @xmath57 starts to depend on the actual value of external field at time instants of steps , and thus on the actual times of steps , and not only on their number . on the other hand , the mean velocity or mean displacement of the particles can still be easily found .",
    "let us discuss the linear response of an ensemble of random walkers performing ctrws to a changing external field .",
    "we consider some physically short time interval @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 be the mean number of steps performed during @xmath59 .",
    "the mean displacement during @xmath59 is @xmath61 where @xmath58 is the mean displacement per step depending on the actual value of the external field @xmath11 : @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the mobility tensor .",
    "the sum in the second expression runs over all nearest neighbors vectors , @xmath64 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath65 is the temperature .",
    "we obtain now @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the typical particles velocity ( which is proportional to the particles current ) is given by : @xmath68 where @xmath69 now the current density is @xmath70 , where @xmath53 is the density of charge carriers ( assumed to be homogeneous ) and @xmath71 is their charge ; the analogue of eq.([ve ] ) holds also for the current , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the conductivity tensor .    according to the theory of ctrw , @xmath74 , the laplace - transform of @xmath52 , reads @xmath75",
    "/\\lambda $ ] , ref.@xcite . from eq.([nmean ] ) we now have that the laplace - transform of @xmath76 reads : @xmath77 the laplace transform of @xmath50 , eq.([wtd1 ] ) , for small @xmath78 is known to be @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the inverse laplace - transform of eq.([flapl ] ) ( for longer times ) thus reads : @xmath80 note that the convergence to the behavior given by eq.([n1 ] ) can be very fast .",
    "moreover , effective interpolating forms valid both at short and at longer times can be obtained . as an example",
    "let us consider the case when @xmath81 is a one - sided ( extreme ) lvy - law , @xmath82 ( with @xmath5 ) , whose laplace - transform is a stretched exponential @xmath83 .",
    "this leads to @xmath84 ^{-1}$ ] .",
    "note that the behavior for large @xmath78 , i.e. short @xmath13 , corresponds to that of @xmath50 , since the denominator of @xmath85 is dominated by the exponential term . for small @xmath78 the asymptotic behavior given by eq.([n1 ] )",
    "the transition between the two types of behaviors takes place at @xmath86 , and thus at longer times eq.([n1 ] ) holds .",
    "thus , for @xmath87 one has @xmath88 a similar equation holds , of course , for the current @xmath89 flowing through the system : @xmath90 the current response of a ctrw - system to an external field is local in time and depends explicitly on the time elapsed after the system was prepared .",
    "systems in which the response to an external agent depends explicitly on the delay between preparation time and measurement time are referred to as aging systems .",
    "this kind of behavior is found to be pronounced in ctrws with @xmath91 @xcite .    to obtain the particle s position and therefore the polarization of the medium we simply have to integrate eq.([ve2 ] ) over time .",
    "hence : @xmath92 or @xmath93 in the limit @xmath94 these expressions for @xmath95 or @xmath96 are mellin - transforms of the external field ,",
    "i.e. : @xmath97.\\ ] ] where @xmath98=\\int_{0}^{\\infty } f(t)t^{s-1}dt$ ] .",
    "thus , the response of the ctrw - system to a time - dependent field decays , and its polarization tends to a constant value .",
    "interestingly , the ctrw - system not only ages , but shows a kind of  freudistic  response : the polarization at time @xmath13 is mainly due to the early history of the system , immediately after it was prepared in its initial state .    let us compare the linear response ( polarization vs. external field ) of a ctrw - system and of a system described by the ffpe .",
    "the current through a system described by the ffpe is given by a fractional derivative , @xmath99 and the polarization of the system by a fractional integral @xmath100 for the constant field @xmath101 both expressions , eqs .",
    "( [ ctrwres ] ) and ( [ polffpe ] ) , describe essentially the same time - evolution ( if one sets @xmath102 ) , since eqs .",
    "( [ ctrwres ] ) and ( [ polffpe ] ) are equivalent to each other under the change of variable @xmath103 .",
    "this equivalence does nt hold anymore for the time - dependent - field .",
    "note that the main difference of the response , eq.([polffpe ] ) as compared with eq.([ctrwres ] ) , is the fact that here the polarization is affected mainly by the latest events , and that the memory of the early history of the system fades away .",
    "as examples we discuss two simple situations of the response of ctrw and of ffpe systems to external fields .",
    "we first choose a rectangular pulse switched on at @xmath104 and off at @xmath105 and then a sinusoidal field switched on at @xmath106 we consider here a highly symmetric system described by a scalar conductivity @xmath107 , in which the current flows in the direction of the external field .    for ctrw eq.([ctrwcurr ] ) gives    @xmath108    which is a causal response concentrated on the time interval in which the field acts .",

    "this limit parallels the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite . in general , however , they are different .",
    "eq.([agedresp ] ) describes a response concentrated on the time - interval of the field - action , @xmath112 : no afteraction effects are seen . the current never changes sign and has finite jumps at @xmath104 and @xmath105 . on the other hand , eq.([fracresp ] ) shows considerable afteraction : the current does not vanish for @xmath113 .",
    "the current diverges at @xmath104 and @xmath105 and changes its sign from positive to negative at @xmath105 .",
    "furthermore , the overall response described by eq.([fracresp ] ) is invariant under time translation , i.e. it depends only on the differences @xmath114 and @xmath115 , which is not the case for ctrw , eq.([agedresp ] ) .",
    "= 8truecm    fig.1 shows the systems response to the two pulses of unit length and unit amplitude following at times @xmath116 and @xmath117 as follows from eq.([ctrwcurr ] ) and eq.([curffpe ] ) .",
    "the parameters are @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the response to the first pulse follows exactly eqs.([agedresp ] ) and ( [ fracresp ] ) ; hence the differences between ctrw and ffpe can be seen clearly .",
    "the comparison of the response of the two systems to a second pulse is also very instructive . for systems described by the ffpe the response to the first and to the second pulses do not differ ( note that the superposition principle holds and that the responses are additive ) . on the other hand , in the case of a ctrw - system",
    "the second pulse causes a much weaker reaction than the first one .",
    "the susceptibility of the system ( the conductivity ) decays with time .",
    "let us now turn to the response of the system to a sinusoidal force switched on at @xmath7 , @xmath120 .",
    "the current through the quasiequilibrium ( ffpe ) system is described by the corresponding fractional derivative , @xmath121 .",

    "since both functions vanish for @xmath2 large , the response of the system ( @xmath126 or @xmath127 ) at long times tends to be sinusoidal , with a phase shift of @xmath128 or @xmath129 with respect to the acting force .",
    "the corresponding functions are shown in the upper panel of fig.2 for @xmath130 .",
    "= 8truecm    for a ctrw system under the same sinusoidal external field the current through the system decays as @xmath131 while the polarization follows : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the fresnel integral .",

    "the behavior of @xmath136 and @xmath137 , eqs.([eq.(31 ) ] ) and ( [ eq.(32 ) ] ) is shown in the lower panel of fig.2 for the same values of parameters as before .",
    "we have considered the linear response of systems governed by ctrw and by ffpe dynamics to time - dependent external fields .",
