    "early studies of superconductivity in materials without inversion symmetry addressed two - dimensional systems , such as thin films , interfaces , and surfaces @xcite .",
    "the recent discovery of the non - centrosymmetric heavy fermion superconductor cept@xmath1si @xcite has drawn attention towards bulk materials .",
    "particular interest arose with the observation that the upper critical field of cept@xmath1si exceeds the paramagnetic limiting field considerably .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this finding is in terms of spin triplet pairing .",
    "however , this is in conflict with the common believe that the absence of an inversion center prevents electrons from forming spin - triplet pairs @xcite .",
    "indeed , inversion together with time reversal are the key symmetries required for cooper pairing . in a time reversal invariant system ,",
    "the lack of inversion symmetry is connected with the presence of an antisymmetric spin - orbit coupling ( asoc ) .",
    "this can be represented in the single - particle hamiltonian by a term of the general form @xmath3 where the vector function @xmath4 is odd in @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 denotes the coupling strength @xcite .",
    "the asoc is indeed detrimental for most spin triplet pairing states as noted by anderson @xcite .",
    "however , it was also found that triplet states whose @xmath8-vector lies parallel to @xmath9 would nevertheless be stable .",
    "such a spin triplet state has the full symmetry of the crystal point group , we will therefore call it the @xmath10-triplet state from now on .    the interpretation of the absence of paramagnetism in terms of spin triplet pairing",
    "is not unique .",
    "paramagnetic limiting is also drastically reduced for spin singlet states in the presence of asoc @xcite .",
    "in fact , the absence of the inversion symmetry leads to a breakdown of the strict classification into even - parity spin - singlet and odd - parity spin - triplet pairing ; these states are mixed , resulting in a state containing both components @xcite . since all but one spin - triplet states are suppressed by strong enough asoc ( i.e. @xmath11 , which is usually the case )",
    ", we concentrate here on the stable @xmath10-triplet state .",
    "high - symmetry ",
    "state mixes with the  @xmath12-wave  spin - singlet state ( which also has the full symmetry of the crystal point group ) , since both of them belong to the same trivial @xmath0 representation of @xmath13 , the generating point group in cept@xmath1si",
    ". we will call this combined phase the  @xmath12-wave state ",
    ".    the presence of asoc leads to a splitting of the electron bands by lifting the spin degeneracy .",
    "thus , the discussion of the superconductivity is in some sense a two - band problem in this case .",
    "assuming that superconductivity is restricted to a single band the basis function for irreducible representations of point group c@xmath14 have already been determined by various groups @xcite .",
    "these studies found that that the quasiparticle gap for the ( most symmetric ) @xmath15 state would have the form @xmath16 which is nodeless in general .",
    "in contrast to these earlier works , we will examine here the full two - band situation .",
    "we show how the symmetry properties of the pairing interaction and the distribution of the density of states on the two fermi surfaces can influence the form of the pairing state and , in particular , can introduce ( accidental ) line nodes in the quasiparticle gap which are not dictated by symmetry . since these nodes are accidental their position in momentum space will vary both with temperature and magnetic fields .",
    "it is also interesting to see how the @xmath12-wave state is affected by non - magnetic impurities .",
    "these properties could be important to obtain information on the complex structure of the pairing state in this material .",
    "the basic model used to describe the conduction electrons in crystals without an inversion center can be written as @xmath17_{ss ' } c_{{{\\small \\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}}s}^{\\dag } c_{{{\\small \\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}}s ' } , \\label{eq-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron with wave vector @xmath20 and spin @xmath12 , @xmath21 is the vector of pauli matrices and @xmath22 is the unit matrix @xcite . the band energy @xmath23 is measured relative to the chemical potential @xmath24 .",
    "the antisymmetric spin - orbit coupling ( asoc ) term @xmath25 is different from zero only for crystals without an inversion center and can be derived microscopically by considering the relativistic corrections to the interaction of the electrons with the ionic potential @xcite . for qualitative studies , it is sufficient to deduce the structure of the @xmath26-vector from symmetry arguments @xcite and to treat @xmath27 as a parameter .",
    "we set @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes the average over the fermi surface .",
    "the asoc term lifts the spin degeneracy by generating two bands with different spin structure . the normal state green s function ,    @xmath30    with @xmath31,\\ ] ] and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) ,",
    "can be diagonalized into the components corresponding to the two bands , using the unitary transformation @xmath34 where @xmath35 defines the angles @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this allows us to express , @xmath38 through the two green s functions , @xmath39 where the quasi - particle bands @xmath40 are split by the presence of the asoc .",
    "the spin structure in the bands is described by the 2 x 2 matrix @xmath41 which act as projection operators in spin space .",
    "since the spins of quasiparticles in the two bands have opposite directions for a given momentum @xmath42 , the matrices satisfy the conditions , @xmath43 and are reciprocal under the inversion operation , @xmath44 symmetry considerations lead to the following form for @xmath9 in cept@xmath45si in lowest order expansion in the wave vector @xmath46 : @xmath47 .",
    "the resulting spin structure is visualized in fig.[fermi ] , where we assume for simplicity that the original fermi surface is spherical .     ,",

    "the conventional s - wave superconducting state belongs to the trivial representation @xmath51 of the inversion symmetric point group @xmath52 .",
