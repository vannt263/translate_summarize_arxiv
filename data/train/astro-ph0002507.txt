    "the star formation history of early - type galaxies provides an important constraint on models for galaxy formation and a test for stellar population synthesis models .",
    "because present - day early - type galaxies consist mostly of old stars , the evolution of their stellar populations may provide clues to conditions in the early universe .",
    "early - type galaxies ( elliptical galaxies and s0 galaxies ) are very efficiently studied in clusters .",
    "they form the dominant population in nearby rich clusters ( oemler 1974 ; dressler 1980 ) , and most of our knowledge of the formation and evolution of early - type galaxies has come from studies of clusters at @xmath17 .",
    "strong constraints on the star formation histories of early - type galaxies have been derived from the redshift evolution of the fundamental plane relation ( van dokkum & franx 1996 , kelson et al.1997 , pahre 1998 , bender et al .",
    "1998 , van dokkum et al .",

    "1997 , stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1998 , van dokkum et al .  1998a , kodama et al .",
    "the strongest constraints on the _ mean _ star formation epoch are provided by the evolution of the fundamental plane , mainly because the mean luminosity evolution is large compared to the mean color evolution .",
    "van dokkum et al .",
    "( 1998b ) find a slow luminosity evolution of early - type galaxies to @xmath1 , and conclude that their stars were formed at @xmath18 for a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , or @xmath21 for @xmath19 and @xmath22 .    whereas the fundamental plane can be used to measure the mean luminosity evolution of early - type galaxies with high accuracy , it is difficult to obtain a sufficiently large sample to study the evolution of its slope and scatter ( but not impossible , see kelson et al.2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , the fundamental plane can only be applied to early - type galaxies , and concentrating on the early - type galaxy population alone may lead to an incomplete picture of their evolution .",
    "there is growing evidence that a significant fraction of present - day early - type galaxies was assembled relatively recently ( dressler et al.1997 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "they may have formed from gas stripping of spiral galaxies ( e.g. , gunn & gott 1972 , tytler & vidal 1978 , solanes & salvador - sole 1992 , couch et al .",
    "1998 , abadi , moore , & bower 1999 ) , through tidal interactions ( e.g. , fried 1988 , lavery , pierce , & mcclure 1992 , oemler , dressler , & butcher 1997 , moore , lake , & katz 1998 , couch et al .  1998 ) , or in mergers ( e.g. , lavery et al .",
    "1992 , van dokkum et al .",
    "early - type galaxies in high redshift clusters may therefore form a special subset of the progenitors of early - type galaxies in nearby clusters .",
    "failure to consider the other progenitors may result in biased age estimates ( see , e.g. , franx & van dokkum 1996 ) .",
    "the evolution of the color - magnitude ( cm ) relation can provide important constraints additional to those provided by the fundamental plane .",
    "the cm relation is useful for studying all morphological types and large photometric samples can be obtained straightforwardly .",
    "the combination of the mean color evolution of galaxies and their luminosity evolution can constrain the imf ( e.g. , kelson et al .  2000 ) .",
    "the evolution of the slope of the cm relation is sensitive to age differences between high mass galaxies and low mass galaxies ( see , e.g. , kodama et al .",
    "the scatter in the cm relation is particularly important .",
    "it can be measured to high accuracy with hst and it constrains the age spread of galaxies of a given luminosity ( bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ; ellis et al .",
    "1997 ; van dokkum et al .  1998a ; stanford et al .",
    "the scatter is proportional to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the luminosity - weighted age ( see van dokkum et al .",
    "1998a ) .",
    "the evolution of the color - magnitude relation has been studied extensively ( e.g. , aragon - salamanca et al .",
    "1993 , stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1995 , ellis et al .",
    "1997 , stanford et al .",
    "1998 , kodama et al .  1998 ) .",
    "these studies are in remarkable agreement : the slope and scatter seem to be roughly constant with redshift , and the mean color evolution is consistent with passive evolution of an old stellar population that was formed at high redshift .",
    "however , these studies suffer from limited membership information and areal coverage ( usually one hst+wfpc2 pointing ) . because the field contamination among late - type galaxies becomes very large at @xmath25",
    "usually only early - type galaxies are considered , and even these morphologically selected samples suffer from significant contamination .",
    "for example , stanford et al .  (",
    "1998 ) estimate that the field contamination among the early - type galaxies in their @xmath26 clusters is @xmath27% , depending on the richness of the cluster .",
    "an additional complication is that the true contamination is expected to vary considerably on the small angular scales of the fields used for these studies .",
    "we are undertaking a program to obtain large field hst+wfpc2 mosaics of clusters at @xmath28 , combined with extensive spectroscopy from the ground .",
    "this program is complimentary to other hst studies of distant clusters , in the sense that we observe only a few clusters , but over a large field and with redshifts for @xmath29 ( field and cluster ) galaxies for each cluster field .",
    "the cm relation in the cluster cl1358 + 62 at @xmath30 was presented by van dokkum et al .",
    "( 1998a ) .",
    "we used a sample of 194 confirmed members observed with hst .",
    "it was found that s0 galaxies in the outskirts of the cluster show a much larger scatter in their colors and are bluer on average than those in the central regions , providing evidence for recent infall of galaxies from the field . here",
    ", we present extensive keck spectroscopy and a large hst wfpc2 mosaic in two filters of the cluster 054 at @xmath1 .",
    "redshifts , morphologies and accurate colors are presented for a sample of 81 confirmed cluster members .",

    "1999 ) . in the present study we focus on the cm relation of confirmed members .",
    "the aims are to test whether the early - types are a homogeneous population at @xmath31 , and to compare their cm relation to those of other morphological types .",

    "<S> we present a study of 81 @xmath0-band selected , spectroscopically - confirmed members of the x - ray cluster 054 at @xmath1 . redshifts and spectral types were determined from keck spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> morphologies and accurate colors were determined from a large mosaic of hst wfpc2 images in @xmath2 and @xmath3 , corresponding to @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the restframe . </S>",
    "<S> early - type galaxies constitute only @xmath6% of this galaxy population . </S>",
    "<S> this fraction is much lower than in comparable rich clusters at low redshift . </S>",
    "<S> thirty - nine percent are spiral galaxies , and 17% are mergers . </S>",
    "<S> the early - type galaxies follow a tight and well - defined color - magnitude relation , with the exception of a few outliers . </S>",
    "<S> the observed scatter is @xmath7 magnitudes in restframe @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> most of the mergers lie close to the cm relation defined by the early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> they are bluer by only @xmath9 magnitudes , and the scatter in their colors is @xmath10 magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> spiral galaxies in 054 exhibit a large range in their colors . </S>",
    "<S> the bluest spiral galaxies are @xmath11 magnitudes bluer than the early - type galaxies , but the majority is within @xmath12 magnitudes of the early - type galaxy sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the red colors of the mergers and the majority of the spiral galaxies are reflected in the fairly low butcher - oemler blue fraction of 054 : @xmath13 , similar to intermediate redshift clusters and much lower than previously reported values for clusters at @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the slope and scatter of the cm relation of early - type galaxies are roughly constant with redshift , confirming previous studies that were based on ground - based color measurements and very limited membership information . </S>",
    "<S> however , the scatter in the combined sample of early - type galaxies and mergers ( i.e. , the sample of _ future _ early - type galaxies ) is twice as high as the scatter of the early - type galaxies alone . </S>",
    "<S> this is a direct demonstration of the `` progenitor bias '' : high redshift early - type galaxies seem to form a homogeneous , old population because the progenitors of the youngest present - day early - type galaxies are not included in the sample .    </S>",
