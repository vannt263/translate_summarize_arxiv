    "understanding the properties of a single quantum impurity immersed in and interacting with a macroscopic background is an important old topic in many - body physics .",
    "finding out how this bare particle is dressed by the medium when the interaction is turned on reveals the emergent physics of quantum many - body renormalization .",
    "one well - known example is an electron moving in a lattice of ions interacting with the phonons of the underlying lattice@xcite .",
    "this lattice - dressed electron , universally referred to as a polaron in solid state physics , has properties significantly different from the simple single free band electron ( i.e. , the bare  impurity \" ) as it carries a phonon cloud ( i.e. , is renormalized ) in moving through the lattice .",
    "while in the weakly interacting limit the polaron simply has a larger renormalized effective mass@xcite than the free electron ( the so - called weak or frhlich polaron ) , the renormalization effect could become extreme in the strongly interacting regime ( the so - called strong or landau - pekar polaron ) , where the electron may become self - trapped and localized ( i.e. , infinite effective mass ) completely losing its mobility@xcite .",
    "although the polaron problem is an old and extensively studied many - body problem in solid - state physics , recent progress in ultra - cold atomic gases provides an alternative route in studying polaron phenomena in the completely different context of collective atomic physics .",
    "the atomic gases have certain advantages in studying the polaron physics as the interaction strength can be tuned easily and precisely by feshbach resonances@xcite , thus allowing the continuous tuning of the same system from the weak- to the strong - polaron limit  something impossible to achieve in solid - state materials where the electron - phonon coupling strength is fixed in a given system . also as one can adjust the shape and the dimension of the atomic clouds as well as",
    "choose different types of particles@xcite , cold atoms provide a much broader perspective of studying the quantum polaron problem .",
    "there have already been experimental studies of fermi polarons ( impurities in fermionic media , and we refer to impurities in bose media as bose polarons ) in different dimensions in the context of highly polarized fermi gases@xcite . for bose polarons , however , it is not until recently that controlling feshbach resonances in bose - fermi mixtures@xcite makes it possible to systematically study a fermionic impurity in a bath of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "recent studies of bose polarons have extensively used the mean - field approach@xcite , which is strictly accurate only in the weakly interacting regime .",
    "these mean - field studies on both homogenous and trapped becs find polaronic self - trapping in the strongly repulsive regime .",
    "it is , however , not clear if the mean - field results on self - trapping are reliable as the interaction effect can be significantly overestimated in the strongly interacting regime . in order to address the properties of the bose polarons close to the strong - coupling feshbach resonance appropriately , one must go beyond the mean - field approximation . for the weakly interacting case , a nonperturbative resummation approach has been applied to study the bose polaron@xcite . in the more interesting strongly interacting regime",
    ", there has been a recent diagrammatic study of the bose polaron problem over the whole feshbach resonance@xcite , in which the spectral function of the bose polaron at zero temperature is calculated by non - self - consistent and self - consistent @xmath0-matrix approximations .",
    "the variational theory can also be used to study the polaron problem .",
    "it makes no explicit assumption regarding the coupling strength , and is therefore equally applicable to both weak - coupling and strong - coupling situations , but the regime of validity of any variational theory ( as well as its quantitative accuracy ) is not easy to ascertain .    in this paper",
    "we develop a different variational theory to study the properties of bose polarons at zero temperature , by generalizing the chevy ansatz introduced in the fermi polaron problem@xcite .",
    "the interaction effect is treated beyond the mean - field level in our theory and thus can be applied to the strongly interacting regime . by writing down a set of trial wave functions and minimizing their energy with respect to the hamiltonian , we calculate the bose polaron dispersion relation obtaining the polaronic effective mass at small momentum . we show that the attractive and repulsive branches correspond to two different solutions of the variational energy minimization problem .",
    "we also estimate the lifetime of the metastable repulsive polaron directly from the imaginary part of the variational energy minimum , thus obtaining both the effective mass and the lifetime of the bose polaron on an equal footing .",
    "our results are consistent with those from the diagrammatic approach in ref .",

    "[ sec : con ] we summarize our results and discuss the possible extensions within this framework .",
    "we consider a system of a single impurity ( typically a fermion ) moving in the background of a bose - einstein condensate with finite density @xmath1 .",
    "the characteristic length and energy scales are parameterized by the density of the bose background analogous to the fermi momentum and energy : @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the mass of the bosons in the bec .",
    "since we only consider the single - particle behavior of the impurity making its statistics irrelevant , we denote the impurity particle as the  fermion \" for simplicity ( although the impurity could also be a boson of different species compared with the bec  our results will remain the same for a bosonic impurity ) .",
    "the fermion - boson and boson - boson interactions are modeled by contact ( zero - range ) couplings , and are characterized by the @xmath5-wave scattering lengths @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively . also from now on",

    "we start with a non - interacting bose gas where @xmath9 .",
    "the full hamiltonian takes the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the kinetic energy terms for majority bosons and the impurity fermion respectively .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath12 in the interaction hamiltonian is determined by the scattering length @xmath6 between the bosons and the fermion , which can be tuned to any value by a feshbach resonance .",
    "for the zero - range model , the coupling term has an ultra - violet divergence , which is regularized by the following procedure : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the inverse reduced mass and @xmath15 is the total volume of the system .",
    "the mean - field approximation consists of taking the coupling constant as @xmath16 , which can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the sign of the scattering length .    for a condensate in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", we work in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "the ground state of this non - interacting bec is a coherent state denoted as @xmath17 , with all particles occupying the @xmath18 single - particle state .",
    "when the fermion interacts with the bosons , it creates excitations that the @xmath18 bosons have certain probability of being scattered into the @xmath19 states .",
    "the fermion itself also gets dressed by these bosonic excitations and becomes a quasi - particle , i.e. , the bose polaron .",
    "we now write down a class of trial wave functions to include the interplay between the fermion and the bosons : @xmath20 this wave function has a total momentum @xmath21 and describes a variational state with one single boson excited out of the @xmath18 condensate .",
    "the theoretical procedure to minimize the energy of this type of variational wave function was first introduced by chevy in the context of fermi polarons@xcite .",
    "it can be generalized for bose polarons as we show here . to find the local minimum energy for the wave function ( [ eqn : plrwf ] ) with respect to the full hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] )",

    ", we have a minimized energy @xmath28 , which provides the dispersion relation of the bose polaron .",
    "the polaronic interaction effect is most naturally extracted from the long - wavelength quasi - particle dispersion behavior .",
    "hence we write down a general expression for the dispersion relation at small momentum @xmath29 as @xmath30 the @xmath31 term is the  self - energy \" , sometimes referred to as the polaronic binding energy , which gives an overall energy shift from the free particles@xcite .",
    "the prefactor of the quadratic term in @xmath21 determines the polaronic effective mass of the single impurity fermion dressed by bosonic bath of the bec @xmath32 .",
    "first we analyze the overall energy shift @xmath31 at @xmath33 .",
    "in general the variational solution contains a real part that represents the interaction strength between the fermion and the condensate bosons , and an imaginary part related to the polaronic lifetime .",
    "for the contact interaction hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) , the lowest - energy state is always attractive and the attraction increases monotonically as the scattering length crosses the feshbach resonance from the negative to the positive side . in the limit @xmath34 , the fermion is tightly bound to a single boson forming a diatomic molecule .",

    "( [ fig : meff - non ] ) for both attractive and repulsive polarons . for the attractive branch , very few bosons contribute to the polarons in the weakly interacting regime .",
    "this number gradually increases as the attraction ramps up and finally saturates at @xmath54 deep in the positive scattering length side .",
    "it signifies that effectively one single boson contributes to the formation of the polaron in this limit , consistent with the nature of the quasi - particle being a diatomic molecule with an effective mass @xmath55 .",
    "we also plot the rescaled effective mass for the situation with different mass ratios between the bosons and the fermion .",
    "we find the intuitive result that the heavier impurity attracts more bosons , which can be understood from a born - oppenheimer - type argument that lighter particles usually move faster and contribute more to the interaction strength .",
    "the repulsive polarons exhibit a similar feature : the effective mass increases as the scattering length comes close to the feshbach resonance until the quasiparticle no longer remains well defined beyond a certain interaction strength , with the whole process being a smooth crossover with nothing drastic happening anywhere .",
    "all physical properties of the attractive polarons discussed in this section change continuously , and are smoothly connected between weakly interacting and tight molecular limits deep on the two sides of the feshbach resonance .",
    "this is absolutely different from the corresponding situation for the fermi polaron where a polaron - molecule transition appears@xcite .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the bosonic ground state we use remains itself after annihilating one macroscopically occupied @xmath18 particle , i.e. , @xmath56 , thus a single trial wave function given by eq .",

    "( [ eqn : consis ] ) one gets the final self - consistent equation of the polaronic energy .",
    "the repulsion between the bosons modifies the physical quantities of the bose polarons , including the self - energy and the effective mass .",
    "here we consider the effective mass for both attractive and repulsive branches as an example to see this effect from boson - boson interactions .",
    "we choose the interaction between the bosons to be @xmath86 , and we assume that the bosons have the same mass as the fermion . as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : meff - weak ] ) , in the attractive branch the effective mass is smaller in the interacting bec than in the noninteracting bec . for the repulsive polarons , by contrast , the boson - boson interaction increases the effective mass . a simple physical picture to explain this is that although the boson - fermion attraction tends to bring bosons to closer proximity of the fermion , the repulsion between bosons counteracts this effective binding process .",
    "in contrast , for the repulsive branch the boson - boson repulsion obviously plays an opposite role and always enhances the number of bosons in the dressing . basically , the presence of an inter - boson repulsive interaction in the bec either suppresses or enhances the polaronic fermion - boson interaction effect depending on whether the polaron is in the attractive or the repulsive branch respectively .",
    "in this paper we study the attractive and repulsive bose polarons in bose - einstein condensates using a variational approach .",
    "the trial wave functions we propose contain a single excitation of bosons out of the condensate background .",
    "the interaction energy , lifetime , as well as the effective mass of the bose polarons can be all captured by finding the energy of the variational wave function .",
    "we do not find any polaronic self - trapping localization ( i.e. , a divergence of the quasi - particle effective mass ) transition at a finite value of the coupling strength in contrast to the mean - field results .",
    "possible modifications in these properties due to higher - order excitations remain an interesting question for the future .",
    "reference @xcite finds a 25% change in the polaron energy from multiple excitations in the bec , while in the corresponding fermionic case the higher - order excitations are of much less quantitative significance@xcite .",
    "one conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is consistent with our variational theory , is that the weak - polaron continuously goes over to the tightly - bound molecule ( i.e. , the strong - polaron in this context ) as the coupling increases without any obvious self - trapping transition .",
    "this is a robust conclusion both in our variational theory and in the diagrammatic theory @xcite .",
    "another interesting topic for future study is the possible mapping between the variational and the diagrammatic approaches . for fermi polarons ,",
    "it was shown that the chevy - type variational approach with one single excitation is precisely equivalent to the @xmath0-matrix approximation in the diagrammatic theory@xcite",
    ". a similar exact correspondence between the two approaches may also exist in the bose polaron case , but it is yet to be proven theoretically .",
