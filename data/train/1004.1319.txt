    "the decay @xmath8 , @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11and 3@xmath11 , though is a major decay mode of the @xmath5 meson , violates isospin symmetry . since contributions from the electromagnetic interaction are strongly suppressed by chiral symmetry  @xcite this decay is mainly due to the isospin breaking part of the qcd lagrangian : @xmath12 so that in principle it offers a way to determine the mass difference of the up - down quarks .",
    "moreover , the selection rule @xmath13 allows us to relate the amplitudes for the two decays using isospin symmetry : @xmath14 theoretical predictions for the decay amplitude have been obtained in the framework of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) : the low energy effective field theory for qcd .",
    "leading order ( lo ) chpt predictions  @xcite based on current algebra underestimate the @xmath5 decay rates by a factor of @xmath15 .",
    "one loop ( nlo ) calculations which include the @xmath16 rescattering effects  @xcite predict higher rates but still below the observed values . some improvements are obtained by computing unitary corrections  @xcite to nlo using a dispersion relation for the decay amplitude derived by khuri and treiman  @xcite .",
    "recently , more advanced calculations have become available . in reference",
    "@xcite the authors use u(3 ) chpt , in combination with a coupled channels method , and treat final state interactions by means of the bethe salpeter equation obtaining good agreement with measured decay widths and spectral shapes . in reference",
    "@xcite a full nnlo computation is performed showing sizable corrections to the nlo result .",
    "+ the dalitz plot of a three body decay is described by two kinematical variables which for three identical particles in the final state , reduce to a single . in the @xmath17 decay",
    "this variable is chosen by convention to be : @xmath18 where @xmath19 denote the energy of the i - th pion in the @xmath5 rest frame ( cm ) .",
    "the variable @xmath20 lies in the interval @xmath21 $ ] , where @xmath22 corresponds to events with 3 @xmath11having all the same energy while for @xmath23 one @xmath11is at rest and the remaining two are emitted back to back . + the decay amplitude is represented at leading order in terms of a single quadratic slope parameter @xmath0 : @xmath24 in case of pure phase space ( i.e. at leading order in chpt ) one has @xmath25 and the @xmath20 distribution is flat from @xmath22 to @xmath26 and then falls to zero at @xmath23 , see fig .",

    "using a clean sample of @xmath27 decays we have measured the dalitz plot slope parameter obtaining @xmath6 in agreement with other recent results of comparable precision .",
    "+ the above value is also consistent with @xmath28 obtained from the kloe study of the @xmath29decay  @xcite using the theoretical correlations between the two decay modes .",
    "+ our @xmath0 measurement confirms the inadequacy of simple nlo chpt computations and the need to take into account higher order corrections .",
