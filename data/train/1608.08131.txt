    "the given resonance is identified as @xmath1  @xcite and is indispensable for description of the chiral symmetry breaking in many phenomenological field models for the strong interactions . in spite of the great efforts invested in the study of this non - ordinary resonance in the last 60 years",

    "the physical characteristics of hadrons are encoded in various correlation functions of corresponding hadron currents .",
    "perhaps the most important characteristics is the hadron mass .",
    "the calculation of a hadron mass from first principles consists in finding the relevant pole of two - point correlator @xmath7 , where the current @xmath8 is built from the quark and gluon fields and interpolates the given hadron . for instance , if the scalar isoscalar state @xmath9 represents an ordinary light non - strange quark - antiquark meson , its current should be interpolated by the quark bilinear @xmath10 , where @xmath11 stays for the @xmath2 or @xmath3 quark . in the real qcd ,",

    "our conclusion , however , turned out to be opposite  a light ordinary scalar state can be predicted in a natural way within the considered framework .",

    "section  6 is devoted to some discussions .",
    "we conclude in section  7 .",
    "due to conservation of the vector current @xmath25 , the vector two - point correlator is transverse and depends on one scalar function only , @xmath26 following the discussions in introduction , we will assume the simplest linear regge ansatz for the vector spectrum , @xmath27 since the isosinglet and isotriplet states are degenerate in the large-@xmath0 ( and chiral ) limit  @xcite , the spectra of @xmath28 and @xmath29 mesons are indistinguishable in our framework .",
    "we will discuss the isosinglet states .",
    "there are at least two reasons to separate the ground state out of the linear trajectory  .",
    "first , the available experimental data show that the ground state lies noticeably below the linear trajectory in all unflavored vector quarkonia  @xcite .",
    "an example for the @xmath28-mesons is depicted in fig .  1",
    ". second , the ground @xmath28 and @xmath29 mesons belong to the leading angular regge trajectory .",
    "it is known that the meson states on this trajectory do not have parity ( and chiral ) partners  @xcite .",
    "hence , the vector channel should have one additional state with respect to the axial channel which will be considered in the next section .",
    "using the spectral representation  , definition  , and ansatz   we get in the euclidean domain @xmath24 , @xmath30 as we motivated in introduction , the residues of excited states in   are assumed to be constant and universal .",
    "in addition , it can be easily demonstrated that the asymptotics `` logarithm + power terms ''   holds only if @xmath31  @xcite which gives a constant for the linear ansatz  .    in the chiral and planar limits ( with setting @xmath32 at the end ) , the operator product expansion ( ope ) of the vector correlator at large @xmath33 reads  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the gluon and quark vacuum condensate , respectively . according to the tenets of classical qcd sum rules  @xcite ,",
    "these vacuum characteristics are universal , i.e. , their values do not depend on the quantum numbers of a hadron current @xmath8 ( the method is not applicable otherwise ) .",

    "we set @xmath39 in what follows .",

    "the value of the pion weak decay constant is @xmath52  mev . since the classical weinberg paper  @xcite one traditionally extracts the transverse part in   ( by adding and subtracting the term @xmath53 ) and considers the sum rules for @xmath49 in conjunction with the sum rules for @xmath54 .",
    "as was motivated in introduction , we assume a linear ansatz for the radial axial spectrum with universal slope .",

    "the sum rules are consistent at some definite value of the dim-6 condensate .",
    "the quark condensate at certain normalization point can be deduced from this value .",

    "there exists a widespread belief that a natural mass of the lightest quark - antiquark scalar state in the qcd sum rules lies near 1  gev .",
    "this prediction follows both from the standard borelized spectral sum rules  @xcite and from the planar sum rules  @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the given prediction is not definitive but rather represents a consequence of some specific assumptions and tricks . as was demonstrated in a recent paper  @xcite ,",
    "if one uses the borel transform and the typical ansatz `` one narrow resonance plus continuum '' , the extracted mass of the quark - antiquark scalar state can not be less than about 0.8  gev independently of any further assumptions .",
    "this is just an internal restriction of the method itself . in the planar sum rules ,",
    "the reason was different . in case of ref .",
    "@xcite , the result seems to be related to the fact that one studied the scalar sum rules in conjunction with the pseudoscalar ones with some shared parameters . in the considered scheme",
    ", the ground scalar state can not be significantly lighter than @xmath128 whose mass was taken as an input .",
    "the pseudoscalar channel is notoriously problematic and the applicability of the sum rules in this channel is questionable  @xcite .",

    "an approximate solution was found by fixing @xmath135 and playing with @xmath136 in some range .",

    "these conclusions agree with our results .",
    "however , the analysis made in ref .",
    "@xcite is completely different .",
    "first , the interpolating operator for the scalar isoscalar states was the energy - momentum tensor in qcd .",
    "the results and conclusions were heavily based on an analysis of the corresponding ope of its correlation function and some gravitational formfactors .",
    "second , all such states were placed on a single radial regge trajectory with half the standard slope .",
    "the existence of this possibility is interesting but we believe that the predominantly non - strange and predominantly strange isosinglet scalar mesons should form two separate trajectories with approximately standard slope , as was advocated in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we have considered the qcd sum rules in the large-@xmath0 limit assuming for the radial excitations a linear regge spectrum with universal slope for the isosinglet vector , axial and scalar mesons .",
    "the choice of the spectrum is motivated by hadron string models and related approaches and also by the meson spectroscopy .",
    "the considered ansatz allows to solve the arising sum rules with a minimal number of inputs . with only two inputs",
    " the pion decay constant and the gluon condensate  the mass of @xmath137-meson is accurately reproduced .",
    "the excited spectrum of vector and axial states looks reasonable as well .",
    "the obtained values of the slope of radial trajectories and quark condensate are then used for the analysis of scalar channel .",
    "we arrived at the conclusion that , interpolating the scalar states by the simplest quark bilinear current , a prediction of light scalar resonance of the mass about @xmath138  mev can be quite natural .",
    "we indicated on the reasons of absence of this pole in the qcd sum rules considered in the past .",
    "the coupling of this light scalar meson to an external source does not reveal any unusual features .",
    "it looks tempting to identify the given scalar state with @xmath1 which is commonly interpreted as a highly unusual particle  @xcite .",
    "this identification would mean that at least the value of mass of @xmath1 is not unusual .",
    "our conclusion correlates with some lattice results : simulations with the simplest scalar quark current @xmath10 yield a mass of the lightest ordinary scalar meson close to @xmath139  gev  @xcite or lower  @xcite .",
    "we also observed that the mass of the lightest scalar meson , although not being a part of the scalar radial regge trajectory , correlates strongly with the mass parameters of that trajectory .    in summary",
    ", there is a possibility that the @xmath6-meson represents a `` turnskin '' resonance showing features of ordinary and non - ordinary hadrons simultaneously .",
