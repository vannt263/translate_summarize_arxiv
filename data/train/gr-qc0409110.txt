    "in the last decades , analytical axially symmetric disk solutions have appeared in both newtonian and general relativistic formulations . in the context of general relativity , several exact solutions were found , among them the static disks without radial pressure studied by bonnor and sackfield @xcite and morgan and morgan @xcite .",
    "disks with radial pressure and with radial tension have been considered by morgan and morgan @xcite and gonzles and letelier @xcite , respectively . also , stationary disk models including electric fields @xcite , magnetic fields @xcite , and both electric and magnetic fields @xcite have been studied .",
    "self similar static disks were considered by lynden - bell and pineault @xcite and lemos @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the superposition of black holes with static disks were analyzed by lemos and letelier @xcite and klein @xcite .",
    "bik and ledvinka @xcite found relativistic counter - rotating thin disks as sources of kerr type metrics , and bik , lynden - bell and katz @xcite obtained static disks as sources of known vacuum spacetimes from the chazy - curzon metric @xcite and zipoy - voorhees metric @xcite , also bik , lynden - bell and pichon @xcite found an infinite number of new static solutions .",
    "recently , exact solutions for thin disks with single and composite halos of matter @xcite , thin disks made of charged dust @xcite , thin disks made of charged perfect fluid @xcite , and thick disks @xcite were obtained . for a survey on relativistic gravitating disks ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the formation of stellar systems lays in its stability .",
    "the study of stability , analytically or numerically , is vital to the acceptance and applicability of the different models found in the literature to describe stellar structures found in nature . on the other hand , the study of different types of perturbations , when applied to stellar structures , usually give an insight on the formation of bars , rings or different stellar patterns .",
    "also , a perturbation may cause the collapse of an stable object with the posterior appearance of a different kind of structure .    in newtonian theory ,",
    "perturbations have been made extensively through the years in analytical calculations and numerical experiments .",
    "an analytical treatment of the stability of thin disks can be found in refs . @xcite and references therein . in general relativity ,",
    "the stability analysis is usually done studying the particle motion along geodesics and not perturbing the energy momentum tensor of the fluid and its conservation equations . the stability of particle motion along geodesics have been studied transforming the rayleigh criteria of stability @xcite into a general relativistic formulation , see @xcite and reference therein . by using this criterion , the stability of orbits around black holes surrounded by disks , rings and multipolar fields were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "also , it was employed in @xcite to test stability in the isotropic schwarzschild thin disk , and thin disks of single and composite halos generated from the buchdahl solution @xcite and narlikar , patwardhan and vaidya solution @xcite by using the displace , cut and reflect method . for the stability of circular orbits in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes",
    "the stability of circular orbits of the lemos - letelier solution @xcite for the superposition of a black hole and a flat ring , as well as other aspects of this solution , are considered in detail in @xcite .",
    "bik , lynden - bell and katz @xcite analyzed the stability of the chazy - curzon and zipoy - voorhees thin disks without radial pressure or tension studying their velocity curves and specific angular momentum , finding that they are not stable for highly relativistic disks .",
    "a general stability study of a relativistic fluid , with both bulk and dynamical viscosity , perturbing its energy momentum tensor was done by seguin @xcite .",
    "however , he consider the coefficients of the perturbed variables as constants , i.e. , local perturbations .",
    "fact that in general is too restrictive .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study numerically the stability of several analytical thin disk solutions in the context of general relativity .",
    "the stability is studied performing a general first order perturbation in the temporal , radial and azimuthal components of the quantities involved in the energy momentum tensor of the fluid and analyzing the corresponding perturbed conservation equations of motion .",
    "the perturbations considered do not modified the background metric obtained from the solution of einstein equations , i.e.they are treated as  test matter \" .    the article is organized as follows . in section ii - a we present the perturbed conservation equations for the general case , when the energy momentum tensor is diagonal with the energy density and the three pressures or tensions all different from zero . later , in section ii - b , we specialize these perturbed equations for the thin disk case where we have a distributed energy momentum tensor with support on the plane @xmath0 . in section iii ,",
    "we analyze the perturbed conservation equations to study the stability of the isotropic schwarzschild thin disk , which contains radial and azimuthal pressures . in section iv",
    ", we analyze the perturbed conservation equations to study the stability of the chazy - curzon and zipoy - voorhees thin disks with only azimuthal pressure .",
    "it is worth to mention that different chazy - curzon and zipoy - voorhees thin disks models with radial tensions or pressures can be built by using a different set of coordinates , but these models do not usually satisfy all the physical requirements , see @xcite .",
    "finally , in section v , we summarize and discuss the presented results .",
    "let us consider the general static , axially symmetric metric    @xmath2    where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are functions of the variables @xmath6 .",

    "all the quantities involved in the energy momentum tensor are functions of the coordinates ( @xmath23 ) only , and so are the coefficients of the perturbed conservation equations . with this in mind",
    ", we construct the general perturbation @xmath24 of a quantity @xmath25 in the form    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the unperturbed quantity and @xmath28 is the perturbation . applying the perturbation ( [ pertur ] ) in ( [ tmunu ] ) we obtain that    @xmath29    henceforth , we assume that the perturbed energy momentum tensor does not modify the background metric found by solving the einstein field equations @xmath12 , i.e. the perturbation @xmath30 acts as a test fluid . with this assumption",
    ", the perturbed energy momentum equations for the problem can be written as    @xmath31    writing in explicit form the four equations from ( [ ptmunu ] ) and discarding terms of order greater or equal to @xmath32 , we obtain the perturbed conservation equations for the system    @xmath33 @xmath34    @xmath35 @xmath36    @xmath37 @xmath38    @xmath39 @xmath40    where    @xmath41    and @xmath42 are the christoffel symbols .",
    "we want the perturbed tetrad to remain orthonormal .",
    "therefore , to guarantee the orthonormal conditions ( [ ortho ] ) we obtain the following relations ,    @xmath43    it is clear from eqs .",
    "( [ conditions1 ] ) that in order to have a consistent perturbation model , the tetrad ought to be perturbed . in our case ,",
    "we are interested in perturbations in the velocity components and for that reason the @xmath44 component of the tetrad must be perturbed .",
    "thin disks are characterized by a distribution valued energy momentum tensor that is a delta function with support on the plane @xmath0 . in this case , the axial pressure @xmath45 is equal to zero and the energy density , radial and azimuthal pressures or tensions are only functions of the radial coordinate @xmath46 .",
    "so , the energy momentum tensor can be cast into the form    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the surface energy density and ( @xmath49 ) are the components of the tetrad previously defined .",
    "note that when we define the energy momentum tensor as above , the fluid quantities ( @xmath50 ) are not the  true \" fluid quantities ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "these two sets of quantities are related by    @xmath52    using the perturbed conservation equations ( [ ptmunu ] ) and the distributed energy momentum tensor ( [ thintmunu ] ) we find that    @xmath53_{,\\nu } =   0 . \\label{thinptmunugeral}\\ ] ]    in this work , the thin disk metrics considered are found by applying the well known displace , cut and reflect method @xcite .",
    "for that reason , the metric components depend on the radial coordinate @xmath46 and the absolute value of @xmath54 .",
    "if we define the derivative of the absolute value of @xmath54 in @xmath0 equal to zero ( @xmath55 ) , and perform in ( [ thinptmunugeral ] ) the integration on the coordinate @xmath54 ( @xmath56 ) , we obtain that the second term is equal to zero and the perturbed conservation equations for thin disks can be written as    @xmath57    in general , we are interested in perturbations of the four - velocity and the thermodynamic quantities on the disk .",
    "thus , we set the perturbations on the @xmath20 tetrad vector equal to zero . also , the perturbation @xmath58 is not related to the perturbation in the radial or azimuthal velocities and we can set it equal to zero .",
    "note that perturbations in the tetrad are independent of the perturbations in the fluid quantities and the assumptions made above do not change the equation of state of the fluid .",
    "so , we have    @xmath59    which implies from ( [ conditions1 ] ) that    @xmath60    and the perturbed tetrad is still orthonormal .    due to the form of the perturbed energy momentum equation for thin disks ( [ thintmunu ] ) , the connection coefficients are only functions of the radial coordinate . therefore",
    ", all the coefficients on the perturbed conservation equations depend only on @xmath46 and we construct a general perturbation of the form    @xmath61    hereafter @xmath62 . with the perturbation ( [ perturbation ] ) and conditions ( [ conditions1 ] ) and ( [ conditions2 ] ) , the perturbed conservation equations ( [ thinptmunu ] ) can be written in explicit form as    @xmath33 @xmath63 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\delta u^\\varphi [ i k_\\varphi ( \\sigma u^t + \\xi_2 p_\\varphi   y^\\varphi ) ] + \\delta \\sigma ( -i w u^t u^t ) = 0 , \\label{thint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath35 @xmath64 + \\delta \\sigma ( u^t u^t \\gamma^r_{tt } ) \\nonumber   \\\\ & & + \\delta p_r { \\rm g}(r , r , x^r x^r ) + \\delta p_\\varphi   ( y^\\varphi y^\\varphi \\gamma^r_{\\varphi\\varphi})= 0 , \\label{thinr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath37 @xmath65 +   \\delta p_\\varphi ( k_\\varphi y^\\varphi y^\\varphi ) = 0 .",

    ", we find a thin disk with surface energy density and equal pressures given by @xcite ,    @xmath71    where @xmath72 means to evaluate @xmath73 at @xmath0 .",
    "recall that we are not using the true fluid quantities , the quantities ( [ sschwa ] ) and ( [ pschwa ] ) are related to the ones cited in @xcite by eqs .",
    "( [ real ] ) . from here and through the rest of the manuscript ,",
    "all the calculations are made in the variables ( @xmath74 ) and the final results presented in the figures expressed in terms of the true physical variables .    we want our perturbations to be in accordance with the equation of state of the fluid , i.e. @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "thus , @xmath77 and @xmath78 satisfy    @xmath79    from which we find the useful relation    @xmath80    substituting @xmath81 and @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ thint ] ) from eqs .",
    "( [ thinr ] ) and ( [ thinvarphi ] ) , and using relation ( [ psigma ] ) , we find a second order differential equation for the energy density perturbation @xmath78 of the form    @xmath83    where ( @xmath84 ) are functions of ( @xmath85 ) , see appendix a.    note that the exact thin disk metrics we are considering are infinite in the radial direction .",
    "so , in order to study the stability of the disks we need a criterion to make a cut - off in the radial coordinate to create a finite disk . from @xcite we see that the energy density of the disks decreases rapidly enough in principle to define a cut - off radius .",
    "the cut - off radius @xmath86 of the disk is set by the following criterion : the matter within the thin disk formed by the cut - off radius is more than 90% of the total energy density of the infinite disk .",
    "the other 10% of the energy density is distributed along the plane @xmath0 from outside the disk to infinity .",
    "this allow us , if necessary , to treat the outer 10% of the energy density disk as a perturbation in the outmost boundary condition .",
    "moreover , the values of the parameters ( @xmath87 ) of the finite disk we create must satisfy the dominant energy condition . for the infinite disk",
    ", this condition imposes that @xmath88 for all @xmath46 .",
    "this inequality is valid in all the disk if @xmath89 , the lower the value of @xmath90 for a given @xmath69 the faster the surface energy density decreases .",
    "furthermore , this condition also implies that no tachyonic matter is present in the disk and that @xmath91 and @xmath92 are in fact pressures and not tensions .",
    "the second order equation ( [ 2order ] ) is solved with two boundary conditions , one in @xmath93 and the other in the cut - off radius set by the criterion established above . at @xmath93",
    "we set the perturbation to be @xmath94 of the unperturbed energy density value and at the edge of the disk @xmath95 .",
    "the last condition is imposed because we want the perturbation to vanish when @xmath46 tends to the outer radius .",
    "now , we consider the isotropic schwarzschild thin disk with parameters ( @xmath96 ) . with these parameters , the outer radius of the disk is set to @xmath97 (",
    "approximately 90% of the energy density is inside the disk ) . in fig .",
    "[ k0k1k2 ] we show the amplitude profiles of the true energy density perturbation @xmath98 for different modes of the perturbation ( [ perturbation ] ) .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ k0k1k2 ] that the energy density perturbation profiles are stable and have an oscillatory character .",
    "when we increase the parameter @xmath99 the number of oscillations within the disk increases and when we increase the wave number @xmath100 the amplitude of the oscillations decreases . note that the amplitudes of the modes decay quickly when we increase the value of the wave number . from fig .",
    "[ k0k1k2 ] we see that there is a factor of approximately @xmath101 between the modes @xmath102 and @xmath103 .    in fig .",
    "[ velocity ] , we present the amplitude profiles of the true pressure perturbation and the physical radial velocity perturbation ( @xmath104 ) for the first three @xmath99 modes with @xmath105 , and the amplitude profile of the physical azimuthal velocity perturbation ( @xmath106 ) for the first three @xmath99 modes with @xmath107",
    ". the modes of the azimuthal velocity perturbation with @xmath105 are equal to zero .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ velocity ] that the pressure perturbation has the same qualitative aspects of the density perturbation .",
    "the azimuthal velocity perturbation amplitude shows an oscillatory behavior but the difference between it and the radial velocity perturbation is that after the first oscillations the maximum value of the amplitude remains almost constant for the rest of the disk .",
    "note that the amplitude of the radial velocity perturbation increases with the radial coordinate . to discuss about this fact",
    ", we have to take into account that we are using in our numerical calculations a finite disk instead of the infinite disk exact solution . in the infinite disk",
    "there is no place for stars to escape from it but in the finite disk this could happen . for our disk to be consistent , the values of the radial velocity perturbation within the disk can not be greater than the particle escape velocity . in first approximation",
    ", the escape velocity of our disk is calculated using newtonian mechanics . in the newtonian limit of general relativity",
    ", we have the well known relation @xmath108 and the particle escape velocity @xmath109 can be written as    @xmath110    for ( @xmath111 ) the escape velocity is @xmath112 and we see from the radial velocity perturbation profile of fig .",
    "[ velocity ] that the particles within the disk do not escape . in the case",
    "when the outer radius is equal to 5 ( approximately 92% of the energy density ) and the same parameters and perturbations are set , the escape velocity is @xmath113 and some modes of the radial velocity perturbation violates the consistency of the disk and can not exist . in other words , these modes describe a disk of a certain cut - off radius with no particles inside .",
    "the case studied in this section corresponds to an extreme disk because the radial velocity of the particles at the cut - off radius are near the particle escape velocity .",
    "this example was chosen by didactic reasons to show the problems that may appear in finding a consistent finite disk model , but in most of the cases these problems do not appear .",
    "recall that the perturbation made to the energy density was 10% of its unperturbed initial density .",
    "if we limited our perturbation to lower values , the radial velocity perturbation through the disk is below the escape velocity .",
    "furthermore , we can define the cut - off radius of the disk when the energy density within the disk is lower than 90% . with lower values for the center perturbation and percentage of energy density within the disk ,",
    "all modes tested were stable .",
    "the phenomenon of particles escaping from the disk is more suitable to occur in the mode with @xmath114 .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ k0k1k2 ] and fig .",
    "[ velocity ] that increasing the number of the wave vector @xmath100 the amplitude of the variables considered decreases .",
    "all these considerations suggest that the isotropic schwarzschild thin disk is stable under a general first order perturbation of the form ( [ perturbation ] ) and favors the formation of rings .",
    "when we performed the radial cut in the infinite disk in order to create the finite disk , we laid outside a fraction of the total energy density distributed up to infinity .",
    "we can model the presence of this exterior energy density , if necessary , by perturbing the outer boundary condition , i.e. , setting in the outer radius the condition @xmath115 .",
    "the numerical experiments realized show that this outer perturbation does not modify the qualitative aspects of our solutions .",
    "however , depending on the value of the perturbation , the quantitative aspects do change , but the disk remains stable .",
    "the chazy - curzon thin disk in weyl coordinates @xcite has only azimuthal pressure , the absence of a radial pressure turns this solution rather unphysical . even though , one can argue that the stability of the system can be achieved if we have two circular streams of particles moving in opposite directions , i.e. the counter - rotating hypothesis .",
    "furthermore , the dragging of inertial frame of a rotating disk does not generate a weyl type metric but the counter - rotating hypothesis solve this problem .",
    "recently , evidence of disks made of streams of rotating and counter - rotating matter has been found @xcite .",
    "also , a detailed study of the counter - rotating model for generic finite axially symmetric thin disk without radial pressure can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "<S> we study the thin disks generated by applying the  displace , cut and reflect \" method , usually known as the image method , to the schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates and to the chazy - curzon metric and the zipoy - voorhees metric ( @xmath1-metric ) in weyl coordinates . in the case of the isotropic schwarzschild thin disk , where a radial pressure is present to support the gravitational attraction , the disk is stable and the perturbation favors the formation of rings . </S>",
    "<S> also , we found the expected result that the thin disk models generated by the chazy - curzon and zipoy - voorhees metric with only azimuthal pressure are not stable under a general first order perturbation .    </S>",
