    "the determination of equilibrium structure is one of the most important targets in electronic structure calculations . in surface science especially , theoretical calculations of surface structures are of high importance to explain and support experimental results .",
    "therefore , a fast structural optimization is an important issue in modern electronic structure codes .",
    "finding minima in energy surfaces is substantially simplified by the availability of analytical gradients . as a rule of thumb , availability of analytical gradients improves the efficiency by a factor of order @xmath0 with @xmath0 being the number of parameters to be optimized .",
    "uk s collaborative computational project 3 has therefore supported the implementation of analytical gradients in the electronic structure code crystal @xcite .",
    "this implementation will also be valuable for future projects which require analytical gradients as a prerequisite .",
    "another advantage of having analytical gradients is that higher derivatives can be obtained with less numerical noise ( e.g. the 2nd derivative has less numerical noise when only one numerical differentiation is necessary ) .",
    "crystal is capable of performing hartree - fock and density - functional calculations for systems with any periodicity ( i.e. molecules , polymers , slabs and solids ) .",
    "the periodicity is `` cleanly '' implemented in the sense that , for example , a slab is considered as an object periodic in two dimensions and is _ not _ repeated in the third dimension with one slab being separated from the others by vacuum layers .",
    "the code is based on gaussian type orbitals and the technology is therefore in many parts similar to that of molecular quantum chemistry codes .",
    "as the density - functional part of the code relies in big parts on the hartree - fock part , the strategy of the project was to implement hartree - fock gradients first .",
    "the implementation of hartree - fock gradients for multicenter basis sets was pioneered by pulay@xcite ; the theory had already been derived earlier independently @xcite . meanwhile , analytical gradients have been implemented in many molecular codes , and several review articles have appeared ( see , e.g. , references ) .    substantial work has also been done in the case of one - dimensional periodicity : hartree - fock gradients with respect to nuclear coordinates and with respect to the lattice vector have already been implemented in codes periodic in one dimension @xcite .",
    "moreover , correlated calculations based on the mp2 scheme @xcite and mp2 gradients @xcite have been coded .",
    "also , density functional gradients have been implemented @xcite . even second derivatives at the hartree - fock level have meanwhile been coded @xcite .    the implementation of hartree - fock gradients with respect to nuclear coordinates in crystal is to the best of our knowledge the first implementation for the case of 2- and 3-dimensional periodicity .",
    "the aim of this article is to describe the implementation of the gradients in the code , with an emphasis on the technical aspects .",
    "therefore , the article is supposed to complement our first article on the purely theoretical aspects @xcite .",
    "an attempt of a detailed description is made ; however , as the whole code is undergoing constant changes , it can not be too detailed .",
    "for example , it did not seem advisable to give any variable names because they have already undergone major changes after the code moved to fortran 90 with the possibility of longer variable names .",
    "the article is structured as follows : in section [ basishfsection ] , we give a brief introduction to gaussian and hermite gaussian type basis functions .",
    "the definition of the density matrix is given in section [ dmsection ] .",
    "the individual integrals , their derivatives , and details of the implementation are discussed in section [ integralsection ] .",
    "formulas for total energy and gradient are given in section [ calculationofderivatives ] .",
    "the structure of the gradient code is explained in section [ codestructure ] , followed by examples in section [ examplesection ] and the conclusion .",
    "two sets of basis functions are relevant for crystal : firstly , unnormalized spherical gaussian type functions , in a polar coordinate system characterized by the set of variables @xmath1 , and centered at @xmath2 .",
    "they are defined as    @xmath3    with @xmath4 being the associated legendre function .",
    "crystal uses real spherical gaussian type functions defined as    @xmath5    this is in the following denoted as @xmath6 , with the normalization @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is an index enumerating the basis functions in the reference cell ( e.g. the primitive unit cell ) .",
    "in fact , crystal uses only basis functions with quantum number @xmath9 and angular momentum @xmath10=0,1 or 2 ( i.e. @xmath11 , @xmath12 or @xmath13 functions ) .",
    "the exponents are defined by the user of the code .",
    "a huge amount of basis sets for molecular calculations is available in the literature and on the world wide web ; also for periodic systems a large number of basis sets has been published .",
    "molecular basis sets can , with a little effort , be adopted for solid state calculations .",
    "high exponents which are used to describe core electrons do not have to be adjusted , but exponents with low values ( e.g. less than 1 @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the bohr radius ) should be reoptimized for the corresponding solid .",
    "very diffuse exponents should be omitted because they cause linear dependence problems in periodic systems .",
    "a second type of basis functions , which crystal uses internally to evaluate the integrals , is the hermite gaussian type function ( hgtf ) which is defined as :    @xmath16    with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the starting point @xmath19    as indicated in section [ integralsection ] , all the integrals can be expressed with the help of the coefficients @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "these coefficients are generated by recursion relations @xcite .",
    "they are zero for the case @xmath21 and for all negative values of @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "crystal uses only basis functions with @xmath9 . therefore , there are @xmath24 coefficients @xmath25 for fixed values of @xmath26 .",
    "as the maximum angular quantum number is @xmath27 , this results in 25 possible combinations of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the maximum number of coefficients is @xmath30 .",
    "these coefficients are pre - programmed in the subroutine dfac3 .",
    "pre - programming is the fastest possible way of evaluating these coefficients which is important because this is one of the key issues of the integral calculation . on the other hand ,",
    "the code has become inflexible as no @xmath31-coefficients are available for higher quantum numbers .",
    "derivatives of gaussian type functions are again gaussian type functions .",
    "therefore , the evaluation of gradients is closely related to the evaluation of integrals . in a similar way as all the integrals can be expressed with the help of coefficients @xmath31 , all the derivatives of the integrals can be expressed with the help of coefficients for the gradients , @xmath32 . these @xmath33-coefficients can be obtained with recursion relations derived by saunders @xcite .",
    "the recursions are similar to the ones for the @xmath31-coefficients . however , as the existing subroutine dfac3 can not compute the @xmath33-coefficients , the recursions were newly coded .",
    "this has in addition the advantage that , by small modifications of the new subroutines , @xmath31-coefficients for higher quantum numbers than @xmath34 can now be computed by recursion .",
    "there are three sets of @xmath33-coefficients because of the three spatial directions .",
    "the @xmath33-coefficients are zero for the case @xmath35 and for all negative values of @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "this means that for a maximum quantum number of @xmath27 , there are @xmath36 coefficients .",
    "three other sets of @xmath33-coefficients are necessary because of the second center .",
    "however , the sets on the second center are closely related to the sets on the first center and can be derived from them in an efficient way @xcite .",
    "after solving the hartree - fock equations @xcite , the crystalline orbitals are linear combinations of bloch functions    @xmath37    which are expanded in terms of real spherical gaussian type functions    @xmath38    the sum over @xmath39 is over all direct lattice vectors .    in the case of closed shell , spin - restricted hartree - fock ,",
    "the spin - free density matrix in reciprocal space is defined as    @xmath40    with the fermi energy @xmath41 and the heaviside function @xmath42 ; @xmath43 is an index enumerating the eigenvalues .    in the case of unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf )",
    "@xcite , we use the notation    @xmath44    and    @xmath45    for the crystalline orbitals with up and down spin , respectively .",
    "we define the density matrices    @xmath46    for up spin and    @xmath47    for down spin . in the following",
    ", @xmath48 refers to the sum @xmath49 in the uhf case .",
    "the density matrices in real space @xmath50 are obtained by fourier transformation .",
    "the calculation of the integrals is fundamental to all quantum chemistry programs .",
    "crystal uses two integral packages : a package derived from gaussian70 @xcite is the default for calculations when only @xmath11 and @xmath51 shells are used ; alternatively saunders atmol gaussian integral package can be used and it must be used for cases when @xmath12 or @xmath13 functions are involved .",
    "the implementation of gradients has been done with routines based on the atmol package .",
    "this is not a restriction , and it is possible to use routines based on gaussian70 for the integrals and routines based on atmol for the gradients .    the calculation of the integrals is essentially controlled from monmad and monirr for one - electron integrals and from shellc or shellx for the bielectronic integrals .",
    "shellc is used in the case of non - direct scf , i.e. when the integrals are written to disk and read in each cycle .",
    "shellx is the direct version when the integrals are computed in each cycle without storing them on disk .",
    "the direct mode is the preferred one when the integral file is too big or when input / output to disk is too slow .",
    "the gradients are computed only once after the last iteration , when convergence is achieved .",
    "therefore , a direct implementation of gradients has been done .",
    "one of the bottlenecks of the crystal code is the restriction to a highest quantum number of @xmath27 , i.e. the code can only cope with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath51 and @xmath13 functions , but not with basis functions with higher angular momentum .",
    "introducing gradients , however , is similar to increasing the quantum number from @xmath13 to @xmath52 for the corresponding basis function .",
    "this means that many subroutines had to be extended to higher quantum numbers , and array dimensions in the whole code had to be adjusted .      in this section",
    "we summarize the appearing types of integrals and the corresponding gradients .",
    "we restrict the description to the x - component of the gradient ; y- and z - component can be obtained in similar way .",
    "note that the integrals depend on the dimension because of the ewald scheme used .",
    "therefore , there are four different routines for the one - electron integrals for the case of 0,1,2 and 3-dimensional periodicity : cjat0 , cjat1 , cjat2 and cjat3 .",
    "similarly , four gradient routines have been developed which have been given the preliminary names cjat0 g , cjat1 g , cjat2 g and cjat3 g .",
    "these routines calculate all the one - electron integrals except for the multipolar integrals which are computed in polipa ( with the corresponding gradient routine olipag ) .",
    "the basic integral is the overlap integral :    @xmath53    the x - component of the gradient with respect to center @xmath54 is obtained as @xmath55    equation [ overlapgradienteqn ] thus defines the coefficients @xmath56 ; similarly the coefficients @xmath57 can be defined .    in the following ,",
    "we use the identity    @xmath58 .      in equation [ kineticnato ] , the expression for the kinetic energy integrals for the case of spherical gaussian type functions",
    "is reiterated @xcite :    @xmath59    the x - component of the gradient is therefore :    @xmath60    as crystal uses spherical gaussian type functions with @xmath9 , this reduces to    @xmath61    explicit differentiation with respect to the other center @xmath62 is more difficult because the kinetic energy operator applies to that center .",
    "however , the differentiation can easily be avoided by applying translational invariance :    @xmath63      the nuclear attraction integrals are defined as    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the coulomb potential function in the molecular case , the euler - maclaurin potential function for systems periodic in one dimension @xcite , parry s potential function @xcite for systems periodic in two dimensions , and the ewald potential function for systems periodic in three dimensions @xcite . the summation with respect to @xmath66 runs over all nuclei of the primitive unit cell .",
    "the x - component of the partial derivative with respect to the center @xmath67 is obtained as :    @xmath68    in the same way , the partial derivative with respect to @xmath69 is obtained .",
    "the partial derivative with respect to the set of third centers @xmath70 is obtained by translational invariance : for each center @xmath70 , there is a derivative with value + @xmath71 .",
    "the electronic charge density is expressed with a lattice basis as :    @xmath72    then , the ewald potential due to this charge density is given by :    @xmath73    the ewald energy of the electons ( i.e. the ewald energy of the electrons in the primitive unit cell with all the electrons ) is obtained as    @xmath74    for efficiency reasons , the calculation of the ewald potential is done approximatively .",
    "a multipolar expansion up to an order @xmath75 is performed for the charge distribution in the long range .",
    "therefore , the electrons do not feel the ewald potential created by the correct charge distribution , but the ewald potential created by the multipolar moments .",
    "it is thus necessary to compute the multipolar moments of the charge distribution which are defined as    @xmath76    with @xmath77 being regular solid harmonics @xcite and the charge @xmath78 defined as    @xmath79    @xmath80 is an index for the shell . the total electronic charge @xmath81 is thus obtained by summing over all shells @xmath80 :    @xmath82    in crystal , the multipole is located at center @xmath83 and therefore it is convenient to take the derivative with respect to center @xmath62 and obtain the derivative with respect to @xmath83 by translational invariance .",
    "the expression computed for the gradients is thus    @xmath84      if the electronic charge distribution is approximated with an expansion up to the maximum quantum number @xmath75 , the ewald potential of this model charge distribution is obtained as    @xmath85    with @xmath86 being the spherical gradient operator in a renormalized form@xcite .",
    "the model charge distribution is expressed as    @xmath87    and    @xmath88    the integral of the electronic charge distribution and the ewald potential function is required which gives rise to the field integrals which are defined as follows :    @xmath89{\\rm d^3r } =   \\nonumber \\\\ & & z_l^m(\\hat{\\vec a_c})\\int\\sum_{t , u , v } e(\\tilde n,\\tilde l,\\tilde m , n , l , m , t , u , v)\\lambda(\\gamma,\\vec r-\\vec p , t , u , v ) \\bigg[a(\\vec r-\\vec a_c)-\\sum_{\\vec n}^{pen } \\frac{1}{|\\vec r-\\vec a_c-\\vec n|}\\bigg]{\\rm d^3r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the term @xmath90 $ ] instead of @xmath91 appears because the multipolar approximation is only done for the charge distribution in the long range .",
    "the penetration depth @xmath92 is a certain threshold for which the integrals are evaluated exactly @xcite .    for the gradients , the derivative with respect to all the centers",
    "is needed .",
    "the partial derivative with respect to @xmath67 is obtained as    @xmath93{\\rm d^3r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in similar way , the partial derivative with respect to center @xmath62 is computed .",
    "finally , the partial derivatives with respect to the centers @xmath94 are obtained from translational invariance .",
    "this term arises because the charge distribution is approximated by a model charge distribution in the long range@xcite :    @xmath95    the calculation of the coulomb potential @xmath96 is restricted to contributions from those charges inside the penetration depth @xmath92 .",
    "the use of the coulomb potential @xmath97 instead of the ewald potential @xmath98 is correct , if @xmath99 is of zero charge , dipole , quadrupole and spherical second moment@xcite .",
    "however , this condition leads to a correction in the three - dimensional case@xcite : although the difference @xmath99 has zero charge , dipole and quadrupole moment , it has in general a non - zero spherical second moment @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , the potential must be shifted by @xmath101 defined as :    @xmath102    three types of contributions are obtained @xcite : zero , first and second order hgtfs .",
    "they have to be combined with the corresponding @xmath31-coefficient . for the zeroth order ,",
    "a contribution of    @xmath103    is computed .",
    "the derivative is therefore    @xmath104    to obtain the derivative @xmath105 , we use the identity    @xmath106    which gives    @xmath107    a similar operation is necessary for the components with @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( first order hgtfs ) which are multiplied with prefactors @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "finally , derivatives of the products of @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( second order hgtfs ) with 2 are required .",

    "one of the gradients can be obtained by translational invariance if the other three gradients have been computed .    in the context of periodic systems , it is necessary to perform summations over the lattice vectors @xmath121 .",
    "we define a coulomb integral as follows    @xmath122    similarly , we define an exchange integral as follows :    @xmath123",
    "the correct summation of the coulomb energy is the most severe problem of the total energy calculation .",
    "the individual contributions to the coulomb energy , such as for example the nuclear - nuclear interaction , are divergent for periodic systems .",
    "thus , a scheme based on the ewald method is used to sum the individual contributions @xcite .",
    "the total energy is then expressed as the sum of kinetic energy @xmath124 , the ewald energies of the nuclear - nuclear repulsion @xmath125 , nuclear - electron attraction @xmath126 , electron - electron repulsion @xmath127 , and finally the exchange energy @xmath128 .",
    "@xmath129      the force with respect to the position of the nuclei can be calculated similarly to the molecular case @xcite .",
