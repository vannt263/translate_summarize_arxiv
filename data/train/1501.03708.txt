    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations are ubiquitous in the field of statistical mechanics , especially for the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "since the historical work of metropolis _ et al _ @xcite , the most outstanding task in this context is the pursuit of new and more efficient algorithms to overcome long time scale problems . since there are few problems in the field of interacting systems for which one can find an exact solution , mc simulations became an indispensable tool .",
    "this is due to the massively increasing in computational power and further due to the development of more efficient algorithms .",
    "more recently , such development focused on the extended ensemble method , where one uses an ensemble different from the ordinary canonical with a fixed temperature , as in the original metropolis algorithm . to name a fill examples we have the multicanonical method @xcite , and the exchange monte carlo method ( parallel tempering ) @xcite .",
    "particularly , during the last two decades , a multicanonical mc algorithm known as wang - landau sampling @xcite , has been at the forefront of interest @xcite and has proven to be a very powerful numerical procedure for the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "the original idea of the wl algorithm is to measure an _ a priori _ unknown density of states of a given system iteratively by performing a random walk in energy space and sampling configurations with probability proportional to the reciprocal of the density of states , resulting in a ",
    "flat \" histogram .",
    "despite being a well - established numerical procedure , it is clear that some improvements on the algorithm are indeed necessary to overcome some limitations during the simulation run .",
    "the method itself was subject to several studies and various improvements to it have been proposed @xcite . by its turn , the mc algorithm used in this work is an extension of the conventional wl where some few changes produce more reliable and precise results .    considering the aforementioned comments , the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , to present a numerically simple and accurate procedure to halting a regular wl simulation run .",
    "this is accomplished with a method proposed in refs .",
    "second , to apply this technique to the square two - dimensional @xmath0-state potts model and compute the static critical exponents for @xmath7 and @xmath12 states , showing that this method is also a helpful tool to address the achievement of critical exponents , a possibility barely explored in the literature , the exception being the important works of malakis _ et al _ @xcite . in the following",
    "we will make use of a combination between finite - size scaling theory and cumulant methods to locate and evaluate the extrema of various thermodynamic quantities and estimate the static critical exponents .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section ii we define the model . in section iii",
    "we define the simulation procedure . in section",
    "iv we describe the finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "the results are discussed in section v. section vi is devoted to the summary and concluding remarks .",
    "the potts model , proposed by potts in the early 1950 s , has stood at the frontier of research in statistical mechanics since its formulation .",
    "it is an extension of the two states ising model to @xmath13 states . in this model , to each lattice site is attached a spin variable @xmath14 ( defined on each site @xmath15 ) which takes on integer values @xmath16 .",
    "adjacent sites have an attractive interaction energy @xmath17 whenever they are equal or @xmath18 otherwise .",
    "the hamiltonian of the q - states ferromagnetic model ( @xmath19 ) can be written as @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the kronecker @xmath22symbol , and the sum runs over all nearest neighbors of @xmath14 . in the low temperature regime",
    "the system is ordered , becoming disordered as @xmath23 increases . in 2d , for @xmath24 the phase transition is of second - order and discontinuous if @xmath25 .",
    "a proper order parameter @xmath26 is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the  volume \" occupied by the spins of the state @xmath0 of largest population and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the wang - landau method @xcite is based on the fact that if one performs a random walk in energy space with a probability proportional to the reciprocal of the density of states , a flat histogram is generated for the energy distribution . since the density of states produces huge numbers , instead of estimating @xmath30 , the simulation is performed for @xmath31 . at the beginning we set @xmath32 for all energy levels .",
    "the random walk in the energy space runs through all energy levels from @xmath33 to @xmath34 with a probability @xmath35},1)$ ] , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the energies of the current and the new possible configurations , respectively .",
    "whenever a configuration is accepted we update @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 is the so - called modification factor ) .",
    "the flatness of the histogram is checked after a certain number of monte carlo steps ( mcs ) and usually the histogram is considered flat if @xmath44 , for all energies , where @xmath45 is an average over energies . if the flatness condition is fulfilled we update the modification factor to a finer one and reset the histogram @xmath46 .",
    "recent works @xcite have demonstrated that ( a ) instead of updating the density of states after every move , one ought to update it after each monte carlo sweep @xcite(this providence avoids taking into account highly correlated configurations when constructing the density of states ) ; ( b ) wl sampling should be carried out only up to @xmath47 defined by the canonical averages during the simulations ( this saves cpu time , discarding unnecessary long simulations ) ; and ( c ) the microcanonical averages should not be accumulated before @xmath48 defined by a previous study of the microcanonical averaging during the simulation ( the ruled out wl levels in these averages correspond to a microcanonical termalization , since the initial configurations do not match those of maximum entropy ) .",
    "the adoption of these easily implementable changes leads to more accurate results and saves computational time .",
    "they investigated the behavior of the maxima of the specific heat @xmath49 and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath50 where @xmath36 is the energy of a given configuration and @xmath51 is the corresponding magnetization per spin , during the wl sampling for the ising model on a square lattice .",
    "they observed that a considerable part of the conventional wang - landau simulation is not very useful because the error saturates .",
    "they demonstrated in detail that in general no single simulation run converges to the true value , but to a particular value of a gaussian distribution of results around the correct value .",
    "the saturation of the error coincides with the convergence to this value .",
    "continuing the simulations beyond this limit leads to irrelevant variations in the canonical averages of all thermodynamic variables .",
    "zhou and bhatt @xcite demonstrated that when @xmath52 is close to @xmath53 the relative error @xmath54 scales as @xmath55 .",
    "conversely , in ref . @xcite it was shown that this convergence indeed holds , but the final result falls in a gaussian distribution around the true value . in this work",
    "it is also noteworthy that the convergence described in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath56 entropic sampling , where the authors argue that the logarithm of the density of states converges as @xmath57 , is not reflected in the canonical averages , since for long simulations different runs do not converge to a unique value , moreover the results take on an erratic behavior .",
    "@xcite also proposes a criterion for halting the simulations .",
    "applying wl sampling to a given model , beginning from @xmath58 , we calculate the temperature of the peak of the specific heat defined in eq . using the current @xmath30 and from this time forth this mean value is updated whenever the histogram is checked for flatness .",
    "when the histogram is considered flat , we save the value of the temperature @xmath59 of the peak of the specific heat .",
    "we then update the modification factor @xmath42 and reset the histogram @xmath46 . during the simulations with this new modification factor we continue calculating the temperature of the peak of the specific heat @xmath60",
    "whenever we check the histogram for flatness and we also calculate the checking parameter    @xmath61    if the number of mcs before verifying the histogram for flatness is chosen not too large , say 10,000 , then during the simulations with the same modification factor the checking parameter @xmath62 is calculated many times . if @xmath62 remains less than @xmath63 until the histogram meets the flatness criterion for this wl level , then we save the density of states and the microcanonical averages and stop the simulations . when one adopts this criterion for halting the simulations , different runs stop at different final modification factors .",
    "having at hand the density of states , one can calculate the canonical average of any thermodynamic variable @xmath64 as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the microcanonical average accumulated during the simulations and @xmath67 , where @xmath23 is the absolute temperature measured in units of @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the boltzman s constant .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was also observed that two independent similar finite - size scaling procedures can lead to very different results for the critical temperature and exponents , which often do not agree within the error bars . the way to overcome",
    "this difficulty is to carry out 10 independent sets of finite - size scaling simulations . in the present work , for each of these sets and for each potts model ( @xmath7 and @xmath11 )",
    ", we performed simulations for @xmath70 and @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 independent runs for each size , respectively .",
    "the final resulting values for the critical exponents were obtained as an average over all sets .",
    "according to finite - size scaling theory @xcite from the definition of the free energy one can obtain the zero field scaling expressions for the magnetization , susceptibility , and specific heat , respectively , by    @xmath74    @xmath75    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the reduced temperature , and @xmath78 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are static critical exponents which should satisfy the scaling relation @xcite    @xmath79    the critical temperature for the potts model ( for @xmath80 ) is exactly known as    @xmath81    and it is expected that this expression is also exact for @xmath7 , although a rigorous proof of this assumption is still lacking @xcite .    following refs .",
    "@xcite we can define a set of thermodynamic quantities related to logarithmic derivatives of the magnetization :    0.9em @xmath82 - 3[m^4 ] ,   \\label{v1 } \\\\",

    "it is easy to show that    @xmath84    for @xmath85 since the critical temperature @xmath86 is known for both models , at the critical temperature @xmath87 and the @xmath88 are constants independent of the system size and we can estimate @xmath89 by the slopes of @xmath90 calculated at @xmath86 .",
    "and then , with the exponent @xmath3 at hand , we can estimate the exponents @xmath1 and @xmath2 by the slopes of the log - log plots of eqs . and",
    "calculated at the critical temperature @xmath86 .",
    "in all simulations we carried out , the microcanonical averages were accumulated beginning from @xmath91 , we adopted the mcs for updating the density of states and the jobs were halted using the checking parameter @xmath62 . in fig .",
    "[ checking ] we show the evolution of the temperature of the maximum of the specific heat during the wl sampling beginning from @xmath92 for a single run with @xmath93 and the evolution of log@xmath94 during the same simulation .",
    "one can see that at the last wl level the logarithm of @xmath62 remains less than -4 indicating that the simulation can be stopped at the end of @xmath95 .     for a single run .",

    "[ vj ] we present this set of lines . from the linear fits to these points we estimate that @xmath101 , yielding @xmath102 .",
    "nevertheless these values represent the result of only one of the @xmath103 sets of finite - size scaling simulations which were carried out .",
    "initially we run over all sets calculating @xmath3 in order to determine this exponent to the best precision .    at this point",
    "we take a moment to discuss which procedure should be adopted to calculate the mean value of these @xmath103 results , a single averaging or an average with unequal uncertainties . in order to investigate the behavior of the data under these two procedures , we grouped the five first sets in a large one and the last five in another large set . taking the averages with unequal uncertainties we obtained @xmath104 and @xmath105 , while if we take just single averages neglecting the error bars , we obtain @xmath106 and @xmath107 , in each of these two large sets .",
