    "are there any undiscovered planets left in the solar system ?",
    "the answer to this question is no and perhaps yes ! if we are talking about planets as large as jupiter or saturn moving in nearly circular orbits with semimajor axes smaller than a few dozen thousand astronomical units , the answer is almost certainly negative ( luhman 2014 ) .",
    "however , smaller planets orbiting the sun well beyond neptune may exist and still avoid detection by current all - sky surveys ( see e.g. sheppard et al .",
    "2011 ) . nevertheless , the answer to the question is far from settled and the existence of an outer planet located beyond pluto has received renewed attention in recent years ( see e.g. gomes , matese & lissauer 2006 ; lykawka & mukai 2008 ; fernndez 2011 ; iorio 2011 , 2012 ; matese & whitmire 2011 ) .",
    "so far , the hunt for a massive trans - plutonian planet has been fruitless .    the recent discovery of 2012 vp@xmath0 ( sheppard & trujillo 2014 ) , a probable dwarf planet that orbits the sun far beyond pluto , has further revived the interest in this controversial subject .",
    "trujillo & sheppard ( 2014 ) have suggested that nearly 250 au from the sun lies an undiscovered massive body , probably a super - earth with up to 10 times the mass of our planet .",
    "this claim is based on circumstantial evidence linked to the discovery of 2012 vp@xmath0 that has the most distant perihelion of any known object .",
    "the value of the argument of perihelion of this sedna - like object is close to 0 .",
    "this property appears to be shared by almost all known asteroids with semimajor axis greater than 150 au and perihelion greater than 30 au ( the extreme trans - neptunian objects or etnos ) , and this has been interpreted as evidence for the existence of a hidden massive perturber . in this scenario ,",
    "a population of asteroids could be shepherded by a distant , undiscovered planet larger than the earth that keeps the value of their argument of perihelion librating around 0as a result of the kozai mechanism .",
    "the kozai mechanism ( kozai 1962 ) protects the orbits of high inclination asteroids from close encounters with jupiter but it also plays a role on the dynamics of near - earth asteroids ( michel & thomas 1996 ) .",
    "trujillo & sheppard ( 2014 ) claim that the observed excess of objects reaching perihelion near the ascending node can not be the result of observational bias . in this letter , we study the visibility of extreme trans - neptunian objects and the details of possible observational biases .",
    "our analysis confirms the interpretation presented in trujillo & sheppard ( 2014 ) and uncovers a range of additional unexpected patterns in the distribution of the orbital parameters of the etnos .",
    "the overall visibility is studied in section 2 using monte carlo techniques and an obvious intrinsic bias in declination is identified .",
    "the impact of the bias in declination is analysed in section 3 .",
    "the distribution in orbital parameter space of real objects is shown in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", our findings are analysed within the context of the kozai resonance .",
    "results are discussed in section 6 and conclusions are summarized in section 7 .",
    "trujillo & sheppard ( 2014 ) focused their discussion on asteroids with perihelion greater than 30 au and semimajor axis in the range 150600 au . here , we study the visibility of these etnos as seen from our planet .",
    "the actual distribution of the orbital elements of objects in this population is unknown . in the following",
    ", we will assume that the orbits of these objects are uniformly distributed in orbital parameter space .",
    "this is the most simple choice and , by comparing with real data , it allows the identification of observational biases and actual trends easily . using a monte carlo approach",
    ", we create a synthetic population of etnos with semimajor axis , @xmath1 ( 150 , 600 ) au , eccentricity , @xmath2 ( 0 , 0.99 ) , inclination , @xmath3 ( 0 , 90 ) , longitude of the ascending node , @xmath4 ( 0 , 360 ) , and argument of perihelion , @xmath5 ( 0 , 360 ) .",
    "we restrict the analysis to objects with perigee @xmath6 90 au . out of this synthetic population",
    "we single out objects with perihelion , @xmath7 30 au , nearly 20 per cent of the sample .",
    "both , the test and earth s orbit are sampled in phase space until the minimal distance or perigee is found ( that is sometimes but not always near perihelion due to the relative geometry of the orbits ) . twenty million test orbits were studied .",
    "we do not assume any specific size ( absolute magnitude ) distribution because its nature is also unknown and we are not interested in evaluating any detection efficiency . in principle",
    ", our results are valid for both large primordial objects and those ( likely smaller ) from collisional origin . further details of our technique can be found in de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2014a , b ) .",
    "[ hunt2 ] shows the distribution in equatorial coordinates of the studied test orbits at perigee . in this figure ,",
    "the value of the parameter in the appropriate units is colour coded following the scale printed on the associated colour box .",
    "both perigees ( panel a ) and semimajor axes ( panel b ) are uniformly distributed .",
    "the eccentricity ( panel c ) is always in the range 0.40.95 .",
    "inclination ( panel d ) , longitude of the ascending node ( panel e ) and argument of perihelion ( panel f ) exhibit regular patterns . the frequency distribution in equatorial coordinates ( see fig .",
    "[ radec ] ) shows a rather uniform behaviour in right ascension , @xmath8 ; in contrast , most of the objects reach perigee at declination , @xmath9 , in the range -24to 24 . therefore , and assuming a uniform distribution for the orbital parameters of objects in this population",
    ", there is an intrinsic bias in declination induced by our observing point on earth . under the assumptions made here , this intrinsic bias and any secondary biases induced by it are independent on how far from the ecliptic",
    "the observations are made .",
    "in other words , if the objects do exist and their orbits are uniformly distributed in orbital parameter space , most objects will be discovered at @xmath1024no matter how complete and extensive the surveys are .",
    "but , what is the expected impact of this intrinsic bias on the observed orbital elements ?",
    "( panel b ) ; as a function of @xmath11 ( panel c ) ; as a function of @xmath12 ( panel d ) ; as a function of @xmath13 ( panel e ) ; as a function of @xmath14 ( panel f ) .",
    "the associated frequency distributions are plotted in fig . [ full ] . the green circles in panel d",
    "give the location at discovery of all the known objects ( see table [ discovery ] ) . ]    . ]",
    "so far , all known trans - neptunian objects with @xmath15 30 au had @xmath1024at discovery which supports our previous result ( see table [ discovery ] and fig . [ radec ] ) .",
    "but this intrinsic bias may induce secondary biases on the observed orbital elements .",
    "if we represent the frequency distribution in right ascension and the orbital parameters @xmath16 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 for test orbits with @xmath1724 , we get fig .",
    "[ rawbias ] . out of an initially almost uniform distribution in @xmath8 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ( see figs [ radec ] and [ full ] ) , we obtain biased distributions in all these four parameters . in contrast , the distributions in @xmath16 and @xmath11 are rather unaffected ( other than scale factors ) by the intrinsic bias in @xmath9 . therefore , most objects in this population should be discovered with semimajor axes near the low end of the distribution , eccentricities in the range 0.80.9 , inclinations under 40 , longitude of the ascending node near 180and argument of perihelion preferentially near 0and 180 .",
    "any deviation from these expected secondary biases induced by the intrinsic bias in declination will signal true characteristic features of this population .",
    "therefore , we further confirm that the clustering in @xmath14 pointed out by trujillo & sheppard ( 2014 ) is real , not the result of observational bias . unfortunately , the number of known objects is small ( 13 ) , see table [ discovery ] , and any conclusions obtained from them will be statistically fragile .    24 .",
    "the bin sizes are 0.45 au in semimajor axis , 0.001 in eccentricity , 009 in inclination , 036 in longitude of the node , 036 in argument of perihelion and 0.024 h in right ascension , error bars are too small to be seen .",
    "the black circles correspond to objects in table [ discovery ] .",
    "data from table [ elements ] have been used . ]",
    "the distribution in orbital parameter space of the objects in table [ discovery ] shows a number of puzzling features ( see fig .",
    "[ rawbias ] ) .",
    "in addition to the clustering of @xmath14 values around 0(but not 180 ) already documented by trujillo & sheppard ( 2014 ) , we observe clustering around 20 in inclination and , perhaps , around 120 in longitude of the ascending node .",
    "the distributions in right ascension , semimajor axis and eccentricity of known objects appear to be compatible with the expectations . however , ( 90377 ) sedna and 2007  tg@xmath18 are very clear outliers in semimajor axis .",
    "their presence may signal the existence of a very large population of similar objects , the inner oort cloud ( brown , trujillo & rabinowitz 2004 ) . the distribution in inclination is also particularly revealing .",
    "such a clustering in inclination closely resembles the one observed in the inner edge of the main asteroid belt for the hungaria family ( see e.g. milani et al . 2010 ) .",
    "consistently , some of these objects could be submitted to an approximate mean motion resonance with an unseen planet . in particular , the orbital elements of 82158 and 2002 gb@xmath19 are very similar . on the other hand , asteroids 2003 hb@xmath20 , 2005 rh@xmath21 and 2010 vz@xmath22 all have similar @xmath16 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and their mean longitudes , @xmath23 ,",
    "differ by almost 120(see table [ elements ] ) .",
    "this feature reminds us of the hildas , a dynamical family of asteroids trapped in a 3:2 mean motion resonance with jupiter ( see e.g. bro & vokrouhlick 2008 ) .",
    "if the three objects are indeed trapped in a 3:2 resonance with an unseen perturber , it must be moving in an orbit with semimajor axis in the range 195215 au .",
    "this automatically puts the other two objects , with semimajor axis close to 200 au , near the 1:1 resonance with the hypothetical planet .",
    "their difference in @xmath23 is also small ( see table [ elements ] ) , typical of trojans or quasi - satellites .",
    "almost the same can be said about 2003  ss@xmath18 and 2007  vj@xmath24 .",
    "the difference in @xmath23 between these two pairs is nearly 180 . on the other hand",
    ", the clustering of @xmath14 values around 0could be the result of a kozai resonance ( kozai 1962 ) .",
    "an argument of perihelion librating around 0means that these objects reach perihelion at approximately the same time they cross the ecliptic from south to north ( librating around 180implies that the perihelion is close to the descending node ) .",
    "when the kozai resonance occurs at low inclinations , the argument of perihelion librates around 0or 180(see e.g. milani et al .",
    "1989 ) . at the kozai resonance ,",
    "the precession rate of its argument of perihelion is nearly zero .",
    "this resonance provides a temporary protection mechanism against close encounters with planets .",
    "an object locked in a kozai resonance is in a metastable state , where it can remain for a relatively long amount of time before a close encounter with a planet drastically changes its orbit .",
