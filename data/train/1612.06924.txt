    "_ this report represents the final report for the master s degree research of alex shvonski in the department of physics & astronomy , university of rochester .",
    "preliminary results from this survey were presented in a aas poster @xcite .",
    "the first author has moved on from astronomical research , and the other coauthors have not had the time to bring the analysis and text up to date .",
    "given the new astrophysical interest in the new , nearby young stellar group associated with 32 ori , and interest in the stellar and disk properties of its membership , the authors have agreed to post this unrefereed paper to arxiv in its original form from 2010 ( excepting comments in italics ) . note that a forthcoming paper by bell , murphy , and mamajek ( submitted to mnras ) will present and improved age estimate for the 32 ori group , a survey for new low - mass members , and analysis of the wise infrared photometry .",
    "revised estimates for the interstellar reddening for the 32 ori group members are much smaller ( e(@xmath8 ) @xmath9 0.03 mag ) than that calculated for the cool stars in this 2010 study .",
    "the original study used intrinsic colors appropriate for dwarfs , however using an intrinsic color sequence appropriate for pre - ms stars @xcite now results in consistently lower reddening values calculated for both the hot and cool stellar populations .",
    "also , the age scale for the @xmath1040 myr - old groups plotted in figure 7 is already obsolete , with the ages of some of the groups having been recently revised upward by @xmath150 - 100% ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is widely established that circumstellar disks are progenitors of planetary systems , although the evolution of such systems is less understood .",
    "a large fraction of stars , thought to be close to unity , initially contain circumstellar material and then lose their disks over time , possibly through processes like accretion , planet formation , photoevaporation , etc . @xcite .",
    "primordial disks become gas - depleted on a timescale of @xmath11 - 10 myr @xcite , and plots of primordial disk fraction versus age show an approximately exponential decay with a characteristic timescale of @xmath112.5 myr @xcite .",
    "the prevalence of gas - depleted ( debris ) disks suggests that the collisional grinding of planetesimals is responsible for dust production , since grain removal processes such as radiation pressure and poynting - robertson drag would not otherwise allow dust to persist for timescales observed @xcite .",
    "mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) excess emission from micron - sized grains in these debris disks is a successful disk diagnostic that can be used to characterize individual objects and examine trends including debris disk frequency vs. age ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "of primary importance are studies of young stellar groups ( i.e. clusters and/or associations ) of disparate ages , which provide snapshots of the disk dispersal process from which we can infer evolutionary trends . + placing our own solar system in context , the timescale between @xmath110 - 50 myr is a particularly interesting and dynamic epoch of planetary evolution @xcite .",
    "radionuclide data ( hf - w chronometry ) suggests that the proto - earth was impacted by a mars - sized body which formed the moon at an age of @xmath125 - 30 myr @xcite .",
    "the frequency and characteristics of debris disks at such ages has potential implications for models of our own solar system .",
    "however , well - characterized samples of stellar associations with ages of @xmath1010 - 50 myr are rare within a few hundred pc of the sun",
    ". this study contributes a snapshot of circumstellar disk evolution among a new nearby sample of young stars in this age range .",

    "first , the median value in a 45@xmath2745 pixel window was subtracted at each pixel location in every image in order to assist in the detection of bright sources , which were not included in background matching estimates .",
    "bright sources were detected in background subtracted images through image segmentation , and these sources were masked during background matching .",
    "background subtracted images were projected onto a fiducial image frame ( fif ) , which defines the overlap between all images .",

    "the ssc provides aldodc images , which also include psac information in their headers .",
    "therefore , we divided the aldodc images by the psac images before applying this correction , so that the psac was not applied twice .",
    "an important caveat to the above corrections is that they are only applicable to objects emitting in the rayleigh - jeans regime at irac wavelengths ( e.g. photospheric emission from point - sources ) ( irac data handbook 3.0 ) . since 32 ori members , due to their age ,",
    "most likely do not have warm inner disks , we expect that their emission will be purely photospheric and no additional precautions will need to be heeded .",
    "+      photometry was performed using the apex routine aperture.pl , using an aperture radius of 3 image pixels and a sky annulus of 12 - 20 image pixels .",
    "this routine computes aperture photometry for a specified point in a set of images ; it applies pmasks , dce status masks , and rmasks , as described in the previous section . as input",
    ", we used the background matched bcd images corrected for pixel solid angles and optical distortion .",
    "we used the median fluxes obtained from sets of corrected images as final values and standard errors as measures of uncertainty .",

    "<S> irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8@xmath0 m and mips 24 and 70@xmath0 m observations of the 32 ori group , a recently discovered nearby stellar association situated towards northern orion . </S>",
    "<S> the proximity of the group ( @xmath193 pc ) has enabled a sensitive search for circumstellar dust around group members , and its age ( @xmath120 myr ) corresponds roughly to an epoch thought to be important for terrestrial planet formation in our own solar system . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify infrared excess emission due to circumstellar dust among group members , utilizing available optical ( e.g. hipparcos , tycho ) and near - ir ( 2mass ) photometry in addition to the _ spitzer _ ir photometry . </S>",
    "<S> we report 4 out of the 14 objects which exhibit 24@xmath0 m excess emission more than 4@xmath2 above the stellar photosphere ( @xmath320% ) though lacking excess emission at shorter wavelengths : hd 35656 ( a0vn ) , hd 36338 ( f4.5 ) , rxj0520.5 + 0616 ( k3 ) , and hd 35499 ( f4 ) . two objects ( hd 35656 and rxj0520.0 + 0612 ) have 70@xmath0 m excesses , although the latter lacks 24@xmath0 m excess emission . </S>",
    "<S> the 24@xmath0 m disk fraction of this group is 29@xmath4% , which is similar to previous findings for groups of comparable ages and places 32 ori as the young stellar group with the 2nd most abundant 24@xmath0 m excesses among groups lacking accreting t tauri stars ( behind only the approximately @xmath5 pic moving group ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also model the infrared excess emission using circumstellar dust disk models , placing constraints on disk parameters including @xmath6 , @xmath7 , characteristic grain distance , and emitting area . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6 for all the stars can be reasonably explained by steady state disk evolution . </S>"
