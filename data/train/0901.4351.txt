    "in a wide variety of galactic environments , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) li 2007b ) . ] are the dominant emitters in the mid - infrared ( mir ) from about @xmath25 - 15 @xmath1m@xmath7 ( vogler et al .",
    "2005 , smith et al .",
    "2007 , galliano et al .",
    "2008b ) . at longer wavelengths approaching the far - infrared ( fir ) ,",
    "thermal emission dominates the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) ( galliano et al .",
    "pahs have been observed in many galaxies in locations often associated with star forming regions .",
    "however , new discoveries of pah emission extending to significant distances ( 6 - 10 kpc ) from the disks of several galaxies ( irwin & madden 2006 ; engelbracht et al . 2006 ; irwin et al . 2007 )",
    "raise important questions as to how these large molecules can be present at such high altitudes above the plane and also their source of excitation .",
    "presumably , far - uv ( fuv ) emission from in - disk star forming regions provides the excitation .",
    "however , a fit to a sed is really required to understand both the contributions from various emission components ( cool stars , pahs , classical grains , etc . ) as well as the stellar component that is required for the excitation .",
    "better yet , a sed fit at different locations in a galaxy , especially at different locations in the disk and/or in extraplanar gas , can further help us to understand the complex interplay between various ir - emitting interstellar medium ( ism ) components and the origin of the excitation .",
    "we have therefore chosen to study mir - submm emission in a very well known edge - on galaxy , ngc 891 ( figure [ fig : n891_wboxes ] ) , that has known extraplanar emission in a variety of wavebands ( e.g. h i , h@xmath8 , dust and co - see sect . [",
    "sec : n891 ] ) .",
    "since there is so much spatially resolved ir data available for this galaxy , it is an excellent target for modeling its sed at different positions in both the disk and halo regions . for this paper , we have examined and compared no less than 20 independent data sets @xmath1 m image was also examined , but found to be of too low spatial resolution to be useful . ]",
    "ranging in wavelength from @xmath21.2 @xmath1 m to 850 @xmath1 m using both space - based and ground - based instruments ( sect .",
    "[ sec : obs_datared ] ) .",
    "to the limits of the variety of spatial resolution , coverage , and sensitivity achieved , we compare the extraplanar extent of the emission and , most importantly , we derive the sed at different disk and extraplanar locations .        because of the proximity of ngc  891 , its almost exactly edge - on orientation , its current active star formation ( sf ) and its prominent extraplanar emission ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : n891 ] ) , this galaxy has been a prime target for studies of the disk - halo interaction . although the specific vertical height , @xmath4 , at which gas might be considered in the halo is debatable , a conservative estimate is 1 kpc ( 21.5 arcsec ) . since all of the 20 data sets examined have higher resolution than 21.5 arcsec ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : obs_datared ] ) , it is possible to distinguish the disk from extraplanar ( halo ) region in the observations presented in this paper .    in the next section",
    "we describe ngc  891 . in sect .",
    "[ sec : obs_datared ] , we discuss the observations and data reduction .",
    "the morphology of ngc 891 is discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] , and the sed results are given in sect . [",
    "sec : sed ] . sects .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusion ] present the discussion and conclusion , respectively .",
    "ngc  891 ( figure  [ fig : n891_wboxes ] , table  [ tab : galaxy_params ] ) is believed to be similar to the milky way ( mw ) in b - band luminosity , rotational velocity , and hubble type .",
    "it is 2.5 times brighter in the ir , and may have twice as much gas and dust than the mw ( see scoville et al .",
    "1993 ) , although the difference is not strong , given uncertainties .",
    "there has been much discussion in the literature as to whether or not ngc  891 is a ` starburst ' galaxy , since its star formation rate ( sfr ) appears to be intermediate between that of a normal spiral and a starburst galaxy ; it may be in a phase that saw more powerful starbursting in the past ( see temple et al .",
    "ngc  891 s current sf activity is clearly indicated by a variety of measures , including the detection , in h@xmath8 , of many bubbles , shells , and supershells in the mid - plane of this galaxy ( rossa et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    ".basic galaxy parameters of ngc 891 [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     an important result of this work is our first attempt at a sed model in the extraplanar ( halo ) region of an external galaxy ( table  [ tab : model_params ] ) .",
    "the extra - planar dust mass results are consistent with those determined from extra - planar absorption ( howk @xmath9 savage 1997 ) , after reasonable corrections for different apertures are taken into account .",
    "the @xmath5 ratios in the halo are similar to those in the disk .",
    "this result was unexpected given the observations of the vertical profiles in figure [ fig:77onk450_24 ] , which show that the cool dust ( at @xmath2450 @xmath1 m , for example ) extends further into the halo vertically than the pahs ( at @xmath27.7 @xmath1 m , for example ) .",
    "however , the error bars are very large for these halo results , and the sed model does not take into account the variation of the stellar populations from the disk to the halo",
    ". a decrease of the hardness of the isrf outward , would decrease the pah strength , for a constant pah - to - dust mass ratio , which is what we see here .",
    "the quantity , @xmath6 , which is close to 1 in the halo , is consistent with an interpretation in which few hot photons are available for excitation .    while ngc 891 is known for large amounts of neutral gas , dig , and dust in its halo ( sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ) , its pah emission is not as extended in @xmath4 as has been seen in several other galaxies which are _ not _ known for abundant halo gas and dust ( see irwin @xmath9 madden 2006 , irwin et al .",
    "2007 ) . since the excitation source for the pahs appears to be within the disk ( see above ) , we speculate that fuv photons that could potentially excite high latitude pah emission in ngc  891 may instead be absorbed by other gaseous and dust components .",
    "that is , other components in the halo of ngc  891 have some optical depth to fuv photons that originate in the disk .",
    "we have examined 20 spatially resolved ir data sets for ngc  891 , 14 of which are newly reduced and/or newly presented data . the emission spans wavelengths from @xmath21.2 to 850 @xmath1 m .",
    "although there are a variety of resolutions and s / n for the different data sets , which include both ground - based and space - based observations , we have compared the spatial distributions , both along and perpendicular to the major axis for a subset of the data .",
    "pah emission is found to correlate well in the disk with molecular gas , likely because of higher densities of gas and dust in these regions as well as the abundant supply of uv photons from sf regions .    of particular interest",
    "is the extraplanar , or ` halo ' gas and dust in ngc  891 .",
    "the h  i , dig , and dusty halos have been established by others .",
    "our work has compared the @xmath4 extents of various components and also shown that pahs also exist in the halo of this galaxy to heights of 2.3 @xmath10 0.2 kpc at a 3@xmath11 level .",
    "ngc  891 is only the 4th galaxy in which pahs have been detected in the halo .",
    "we find that cool halo gas , as measured by @xmath2450 @xmath1 m emission , is broader in @xmath4 than both warm halo gas @xmath224 @xmath1 m and pah emission , suggesting that the dust heating sources and pah excitation sources are within the disk .",
    "we have used our multi - frequency data set to construct complete ir spectra for four different locations in the disk of ngc  891 and two in its halo .",
    "this has allowed us to model seds in different environments both within the disk of ngc  891 and , for the first time , in the halo .",
    "the sed models have allowed us to determine the mass of dust , fraction of pahs , and fraction of ionized pahs for these different environments ( table  [ tab : model_params ] ) .",
    "we find that the pah fraction , @xmath5 , is similar to galactic values ( within a factor of two ) and this value is lowest in the galaxy s center , consistent with previous studies of pahs in galaxies .",
    "the fraction of dust exposed to a colder ( i.e. equivalent to an equilibrium dust temperature less than 25 k ) radiation field , @xmath6 , is also lowest in the center , suggesting the presence of a hotter radiation field at the center of the galaxy .    in the extraplanar dust",
    ", @xmath5 is similar to @xmath5 in the disk .",
    "therefore we can not conclude a lower pah abundance , especially since the sed model used does not take into account a changing radiation field that is more typical of a halo .",
    "the model used could take into account the changing radiation field , but we would have needed additional constraints .",
    "the fraction of pahs exposed to a cold radiation field is very high in the halo and is almost unity .",
    "together with the vertical halo extents indicated above , these results suggest that the halo pahs are excited from escaping disk photons .",
