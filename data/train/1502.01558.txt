    "semileptonic decay of the @xmath2 mesons ( @xmath3 decay ) provides a solid basis for testing various features of the standard model ( sm ) . in particular",
    ", the @xmath3 decay can be used for determining the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite precisely within the standard model ( sm )  ( see for example a recent analysis  @xcite and references therein ) . since the @xmath4-boson exchange in the sm governs the physics of the @xmath3 decay ,",
    "the @xmath0 vector transition elements have been mainly considered to describe the @xmath3 decay , while other terms such as the tensor component were set aside .",
    "several experimental collaborations have searched for possible nonzero values of the @xmath0 tensor form factors but found that the results turned out to be more or less consistent with the sm prediction of the null value of the tensor form factors  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , extensions beyond the sm ( bsm ) with supersymmetry shed new light on the role of the tensor operator in describing various weak decay processes of the kaon  @xcite ( see also recent reviews  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these tensor operators arising from the bsm extensions reveal new physics originating at the tev scale , which may be checked due to recent experimental progress in the near future . in the meanwhile , lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd )",
    "can also test the reliability of these operators .",
    "very recently , baum et al .",
    "@xcite computed the matrix elements of the electromagnetic operator @xmath5  @xcite between the pion and the kaon within lqcd , which may be related to the cp - violating part of the @xmath6 semileptonic decays .",
    "the tensor operator has another prominent place on the transversity of hadrons  @xcite .",
    "while the transversity of hadrons provides us with essential information on the quark spin structure of hadrons , it is very difficult to be measured experimentally owing to its chiral - odd nature and the absence of its direct probe .",
    "however , using semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes , anselmino et al .",
    "were able to extract the transverse parton distribution functions of the nucleon and the corresponding tensor charges  @xcite .",
    "while the transversity of the nucleon was extensively studied , the transversities of the @xmath7 and @xmath2 mesons received little attention again because of experimental difficulties to measure them . in the meanwhile",
    ", it was found that the tensor form factors of hadrons can be understood as generalized form factors that are defined as the mellin moments of generalized parton distributions ( gpds )  ( see reviews  @xcite for details ) .",
    "moreover , the tensor form factors unveil the transverse quark spin structure inside a hadron in the transverse plane  @xcite with the proper probabilistic interpretation of the transverse quark densities  @xcite . recently , qcdsf / ukqcd collaborations announced the first results for the pion transversity on lattice  @xcite .",
    "they also presented the probability density of the polarized quarks inside the pion , combining the electromagnetic form factor of the pion  @xcite with its tensor form factor .",
    "it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that when the quarks are transversely polarized , their spatial distribution in the transverse plane is strongly distorted .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0 transitions can be also investigated from a different point of view .",
    "exclusive or semi - exclusive weak processes may provide information on the @xmath0 transitions via the weak gpds .",
    "in fact , the weak gpds of baryons have been already examined in refs .  @xcite .",
    "it is thus worthwhile to study the @xmath0 transition gpds .",
    "the @xmath0 transition gpds provide much more information than the @xmath3 form factors and the tensor form factors , since they include all information about the @xmath0 transition generalized form factors , as mentioned above .",
    "thus , in the present work , we want to investigate the generalized transition vector form factors and the multi - faceted generalized tensor form factors in the context of the @xmath0 transition . in ref .",
    "@xcite , two of the authors have investigated the transition vector form factors of the @xmath3 decay , based on the low - energy effective chiral action from the instanton vacuum",
    ". however , ref .",
    "@xcite concentrated mainly on the @xmath3 decay . in this work ,",
    "we extend the previous investigation by computing the @xmath0 transition vector and tensor form factors also in the space - like region .",
    "once we have these form factors , we can immediately study the transverse quark spin densities of the @xmath0 transition .    in the present work ,",
    "we want to utilize the nonlocal chiral quark model ( nl@xmath8qm ) from the instanton vacuum to compute the @xmath0 transition vector and tensor form factors , aiming at examining the transverse quark spin densities in the course of the @xmath1 transition .",
    "the nl@xmath8qm from the instanton was first derived by diakonov and petrov  @xcite in the chiral limit and was extended beyond the chiral limit  @xcite . since the instanton vacuum realizes the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( s@xmath8sb ) naturally via quark zero modes , the nl@xmath8qm from the instanton vacuum provides a good framework to study the vector and tensor form factors of the @xmath1 transition .",
    "in fact , the model has been proven to be successful in reproducing experimental data or in comparison with the results of lqcd for the @xmath7 and @xmath2 mesons such as the low - energy constants of the chiral lagrangians  @xcite , electromagnetic form factors  @xcite , meson distribution amplitudes  @xcite , semileptonic decays  @xcite , tensor form factors  @xcite , etc  @xcite .",
    "the nl@xmath8qm is characterized by the two phenomenological parameters , i.e. , the average instanton size ( @xmath9 fm ) and the average inter - instanton distance ( @xmath10 fm ) .",
    "an essential advantage of this approach lies in the fact that the normalization point is naturally given by the average size of instantons and is approximately equal to @xmath11 .",
    "this fact is essential , in particular , when one calculates the matrix elements of the tensor current , since they are scale - dependent . to compare the results of the tensor form factors from any model , the normalization scale",
    "should be well defined such that the results can be compared to those from other models or from lqcd .",
    "the values of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 were estimated many years ago phenomenologically  @xcite as well as theoretically  @xcite .",
    "once the above - mentioned two parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 are determined , the nl@xmath8qm from the instanton vacuum does not have any adjustable parameter . furthermore",
    ", this approach was supported by several lqcd studies of the qcd vacuum  @xcite and the momentum dependence of the dynamical quark mass from the instanton vacuum  @xcite is in a remarkable agreement with those from lqcd  @xcite .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce the @xmath0 transition gpds based on which the generalized form factors are defined .",
    "we also present the definition of the transverse quark spin densities of the @xmath0 transition . in section iii",
    ", we show how to compute the transition vector and tensor form factors within the framework of the n@xmath8qm . in section iv , we present the results and discuss them .",
    "the final section is devoted to the summary of the present work and discuss future perspectives related to the transition gpds and generalized form factors .",
    "the transition vector ( tensor ) gpds @xmath14 for the @xmath0 transition are defined respectively in terms of the matrix element of the vector ( tensor ) nonlocal operators between the @xmath15 and the @xmath16 states : @xmath17 u(\\lambda n/2 ) | k^0 ( p ) \\rangle , \\cr \\frac { p^+\\delta^{j}-\\delta^jp^+}{m_k } e_{t}^{k\\pi } ( x , \\xi , t ) & = & \\int \\frac{d\\lambda}{2\\pi } e^{ix\\lambda    ( p \\cdot n ) } \\langle \\pi^-(p ' ) | \\bar{s } ( - \\lambda n /2)i \\sigma^{+j } [ -\\lambda n/2,\\lambda n/2 ] u(\\lambda n/2 ) | k^0 ( p ) \\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 denotes the light - like auxiliary vector .",
