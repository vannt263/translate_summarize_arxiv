    "a few years ago an approach was put forward @xcite in which heavy mass scales in four dimensions could be replaced by lighter mass scales in higher dimensions .",
    "such a class of theories is nowadays conventionally considered in the context of the brane paradigm . in one class of models extra dimensions",
    "are felt only by gravity ( as well as other fields transforming as singlet under the standard - model gauge group ) ; in the other class they are felt also by gauge fields . in the former case ,",
    "the standard - model fields are confined to a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional subspace of a higher - dimensional space some dimensions of which are compactified with a relatively large radius .",
    "the absence of any observed deviation from ordinary newtonian gravity in cavendish - type laboratory experiments implies that the largest compactification radius is smaller than around 0.2 mm @xcite .",
    "the main goal in both classes of models is to provide a unified theory in which the electroweak scale @xmath5 and the high energy scales ( planck @xcite , string @xcite , and gut scales @xcite ) can coexist .",
    "the same scenario has also been successfully applied to neutrino as well as to axion phenomenology .",
    "namely , a higher - dimensional seesaw mechanism may provide light neutrino masses without heavy mass scales @xcite .",
    "similarly , axion invisibility can be achieved in extra dimensions even with a low fundamental peccei - quinn ( pq ) scale @xcite .",
    "the cern axion solar telescope ( cast ) is designed to search for solar axions of a broad energy spectrum which peaks at about 4 kev , through their conversion into real photons inside the transverse magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this telescope may improve the current laboratory bounds on the axion - photon coupling , @xmath6 for @xmath7 ev and @xmath8 for @xmath9 @xcite , by a factor of ten or even more .",
    "it also has the potential to extend for the first time the axion searches beyond the limit @xmath10 arising from astrophysical constraints on anomalous energy loss by stars @xcite .",
    "although the cast telescope could in principle be sensitive to axion masses in the range of a few kev , the coherence - loss constraints @xcite reduce the sensitivity down to around 1 ev .",
    "the first goal of the present note is to interpret prospects of cast in the light of the theory with large extra spatial dimensions .",
    "we focus on the case when the limit on the size of two large extra compact dimensions is set by direct tests of gravity @xcite .",
    "our second goal is to explore the potential of cast for testing the presence of large extra dimensions .",
    "axions are pseudoscalars arising in models which resolve the strong _ cp _ problem in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) by the pq mechanism @xcite . owing to their potential abundance in the early universe",
    ", they are also well - motivated candidates for the dark matter of the universe . in both classes of ( conventional ) invisible axion models",
    "referred to as ksvz or hadronic axion models @xcite ( where axions do not couple to electrons at tree level ) and dfsz or grand unified theory ( gut ) models @xcite , the axion - photon coupling strength is given by the relation @xmath11 here @xmath12 is a model - dependent numerical parameter for hadronic axions , while for dfsz axions @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , the mass of the ( qcd ) axion @xmath4 is related to the pq symmetry breaking scale @xmath14 by @xmath15 in order to avoid ambiguities owing to the model - dependence of the parameter @xmath12 for hadronic axions , it proved more convenient to make constraints on the axion - photon coupling than on the pq energy scale or on the axion mass .",
    "in contrast , cosmological considerations and astrophysical arguments ( i.e. , axion emission due to nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung from the supernova sn 1987a ) bound the axion mass into two possible ranges @xcite .",
    "the first window is @xmath16 , in which case the axion could constitute the cold dark matter of the universe . the second one , being around ten to twenty electronvolts , appears to be of interest for hot dark matter .",
    "however , such astrophysical constraints on @xmath4 , although the most stringent , suffer from statistical weakness ( with only 19 neutrinos being observed ) as well as from all uncertainties related to the axion emission from a hot / dense medium .",
    "it is therefore of crucial importance to probe the axion properties in a model - independent way @xcite .",
    "currently , laboratory searches for solar axions @xcite are being extended by the cast experiment at cern .",
    "this telescope uses a decommissioned lhc prototype magnet with a field of 9 t and a length @xmath17 of 10 m. the magnet contains two straight beam pipes with an effective cross sectional area @xmath18 , and is mounted on a moving platform with low - background x - ray detectors on either end allowing it to track the sun about 3 hours per day .",
    "hadronic axions could be produced abundantly in the core of the sun by the primakoff conversion of the blackbody photons in the coulomb fields of nuclei and electrons in the solar plasma .",
    "the outgoing axion flux is robust and does not depend on subtle details of the solar model .",
    "it is approximately given by @xcite @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the axion flux at the earth , differential with respect to axion energy ( @xmath21 ) , and expressed as a function of axion mass ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath21 , @xmath23 , and @xmath22 are to be taken in kev .",
    "the probability for an axion - to - photon conversion in the presence of a transverse magnetic field ( @xmath24 ) and a refractive medium ( i ) is given by @xcite @xmath25 ,    \\label{eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the momentum difference between photons in the medium and axions , and @xmath27 denotes the inverse absorption length for x - rays .",
    "the effective mass ( plasma frequency ) for an x - ray in he can be described in terms of the operating pressure @xmath28 ( at 300 k ) as @xmath29 .",
    "the coherence condition @xmath30 @xcite requires @xmath31 for a photon energy of 4.2 kev ( the average axion energy ) and a coherence length of 10 m in vacuum . to search for axions more massive",
    ", coherence can be restored by filling the magnetic conversion region with buffer gas .",
    "integrating over all axion energies , the expected number of photons @xmath32 , being detected during the times of solar alignment with the magnet ( @xmath33 ) , is finally @xmath34 assuming 100% detection efficiency for the conversion x - rays . at a fixed pressure @xmath28 ,",
    "the response of cast will be a sharply peaked function of the actual axion mass @xmath22 , with the fractional resolution @xmath35 . a general analysis of the experimental prospects @xcite explores the full two - dimensional ( @xmath36 ) space for qcd axions rather than the narrow band defined by conventional axion models ( although it remains the best - motivated region ) , as it is shown in fig .",
    "the experiment is being operated in a scanning mode in which the gas pressure is varied in appropriate steps ( 1yr with vacuum , an additional 1yr with a he gas pressure increased from 0 - 1atm in 100 increments , and an additional 1yr with 1 - 10atm in 365 increments ) to cover a range of possible axion masses up to 0.82 ev .",
    "large extra dimensions aim to stabilize the mass hierarchy ( i.e. , the hierarchy between the planck scale and the electroweak scale ) by producing the hugeness of the planck mass @xmath37 via the relation @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the full volume of the compactified space , and the fundamental scale is set at @xmath40 .",
    "as already stressed , a singlet higher - dimensional axion field is also free to propagate into the bulk and therefore a similar volume - suppressed formula can be used to lower the fundamental peccei - quinn symmetry - breaking scale @xmath41 @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the string scale , @xmath44 . since the phenomenologically allowed region for @xmath14 ( also generating the coupling between the axion and matter ) is such that @xmath45 , the axion must be restricted to a subspace of the full higher - dimensional bulk ( @xmath46 ) , if @xmath41 is to reside in the tev - range @xcite .",
    "still , @xmath47 is possible for @xmath48 @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the full generalization of the higher - dimensional pq mechanism was given , including a thorough discussion of how extra space dimensions may contribute to the invisibility of the pq axion .",
    "all new phenomena contributing to the invisibility of the axion and found there rely on a nontrivial axion mass matrix .",
    "such a matrix is induced by a mixing between the four - dimensional axion and the infinite tower of kk excitations .",
    "the most interesting phenomenological consequence implied by such a mixing is a decoupling of the mass eigenstate of the axion from the pq scale ( for @xmath49 ) . since this feature is crucial for our considerations here",
    ", we discuss it in more detail below .",
    "now , we can focus on the higher - dimensional case by considering first the kk decomposition of the axion field . as a major step ,",
    "we need to calculate the estimated number of x - rays at the pressure @xmath50 as a function of the kk axion mass .",
    "the masses of the kk modes are given by @xmath51 where we assume that all @xmath52 extra dimensions are of the same size @xmath1 .",
    "when the mass splitting for the size @xmath1 ( @xmath53 ) is sufficiently small , one is allowed to use integration instead of summation @xcite .",
    "we have already mentioned that because of the nontrivial axion mass matrix , neither the four - dimensional axion nor the kk states represent the mass eigenstates . instead , the eigenvalues are given as solutions to the transcendental equation @xcite @xmath54 hence , in order to estimate the number of modes with the kk index between @xmath52 and @xmath55 , one should parameterize the whole set of eigenvalues of ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "this can be done by solving ( [ eq9 ] ) for two limiting cases , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we find for the eigenvalues @xmath58 and @xmath59 the results from ref .",
    "@xcite , where only the mass of the axion zero - mode was estimated , can now be easily reproduced from our expressions ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the mass of the first kk state as a function of @xmath60 .",
    "it can be seen how the mass quickly approaches its limiting value ( 3/2)@xmath61 . a similar feature was found in ref .",
    "@xcite for the zero - mode .    , where @xmath4 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq2]).,width=302 ]    finally , the total number of x - rays due to all modes of the kk tower reads @xmath62 and @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the surface of a unit radius in @xmath65 dimensions and @xmath66 is defined as @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the function @xmath66 arises from the mixing between the kk axion modes entering the kk decomposition of the higher - dimensional axion field and the corresponding normalized mass eigenstates @xcite .",
    "it also implies both production and detection of kk axions to occur on our standard - model brane .",
    "the function @xmath66 also incorporates the effect of rapid decoherency @xcite of the only linear combination of kk states of the bulk axion which couples to standard - model fields .",
    "this means that the production and subsequent detection of this particular linear combination of kk states are strongly suppressed . as a consequence",
    "our results always reflect a volume - suppressed coupling @xmath70 .",
    "if it was not for the decoherency , the linear combination would be coupled to photons with an unsuppressed coupling @xmath71 .",
    "in order to achieve an upper limit on the coupling of the axion to photons from the prospects of cast in the framework of large extra dimensions , we apply the central limit theorem at 3@xmath72 level @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the background of the x - ray detector ( with numerical values taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", it is assumed that all axions have an average energy of 4.2 kev .",
    "combining eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) with eqs .",
    "( [ eq3])-([eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq12])-([eq13a ] ) for the case of two extra dimensions ( we take the largest compactification radius of 0.150 mm as set by direct tests of newton s law @xcite ) , we have derived limits on the axion - photon coupling @xmath75 as a function of the fundamental pq mass , as shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] .     as a function of the fundamental pq mass @xmath4 .",
    "the solid line , corresponding to prospects of cast for qcd axions , is obtained using numerical values from ref .",
    "the dashed region marks the theoretically favored relation between @xmath75 and @xmath4 in axion models in four dimensions . the dashed and dot - dashed line correspond to prospects of cast for kk axions in the case of two extra dimensions ( @xmath76 mm ) for @xmath77 and for @xmath78 , respectively.,width=302 ]    although the multiplicity of kk states to which cast could be sensitive is large ( @xmath79 for @xmath77 and @xmath80 for @xmath78 ) , one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the upper limit on @xmath75 is only at most an order of magnitude more stringent than that obtained in conventional theories .",
    "this is due to the fact that cast is a tuning experiment , i.e. , the coherence condition at a fixed pressure is fulfilled only within a very narrow window of axion masses around @xmath81 .",
    "the corresponding width ranges ( depending on pressure ) from @xmath82 down to @xmath83 .",
    "another feature visible in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is a strong decrease in sensitivity to @xmath75 for @xmath84 if @xmath78 and for somewhat lower values if @xmath77 .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the regime @xmath56 , @xmath66 decreases as fast as @xmath85 .",
    "it is just the regime in which the obtained limits on @xmath75 can not be coupled with the zero - mode axion mass ( @xmath86 ) via relations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) because in higher dimensions the mass of the axion is approximatively given as @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the case of ordinary qcd axions , in theories with large extra dimensions zero - mode axions with masses outside the favored band ( as determined by conventional axion models in four dimensions ) arise quite naturally .",
    "now we would like to point to a new phenomenon predicted for cast : sensitivity to particular kk axions . we have already noted that physical kk modes are given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "it is expected that more than one axion signal may be observed at different pressures of the gas .",
    "therefore , the detection of the corresponding x - rays at least at two pressures may be the signal for the presence of large extra dimensions .",
    "as the cast experiment is scanning the range of axion masses up to 0.82 ev , this requirement actually defines a sensitivity of the experiment to test the compactification radius . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) we obtain @xmath88 if @xmath89 and @xmath90 if @xmath91 , with @xmath92 .",
    "it should be noted here that with the cast sensitivity to @xmath75 the former result holds only for @xmath93 ; for @xmath56 the sensitivity rapidly decreases due to the suppression from the @xmath66 function .",
    "the present modifications of cast may increase its sensitivity to @xmath75 by a factor of 1.5 @xcite , providing the sensitivity as mentioned above is of the order of that derived from the solar age consideration @xcite .",
    "note that in a recent review of the particle data group @xcite the bound on @xmath1 for the case of two extra dimensions , coming from astrophysics , was listed to have a value within the range 90 to 660 nm ( for the most stringent constraints , see the recent work @xcite ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we have explored the potential of the cast experiment for observing kk axions coming from the solar interior . because of the restrictive coherence condition , in theories with two extra dimensions ( with @xmath76  mm ) a sensitivity in axion - photon coupling improves at most one order of magnitude in both data taking phases . in this case , the obtained limit on @xmath75 can not be coupled with the mass of the axion , which is essentially given by the ( common ) radius of the extra dimensions . in addition , we have demonstrated that the cast experiment , being a tuning experiment with respect to axion masses , may not be sensitive only to an integrated effect of kk modes up to the kinematical limit but also to particular kk axions . with a requirement to have at least two signals while changing pressure of the gas , we have found that cast is capable of probing ( two ) large extra dimensions with a compactification radius @xmath1 down to around 250 nm if @xmath2 , and down to around 370 nm if @xmath3",
