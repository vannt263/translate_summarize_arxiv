    "a large class of fluids can be described generically as `` big charged particles immersed in a neutralising medium of lighter particles '' . examples include charged colloidal suspensions@xcite and dusty plasmas.@xcite a simple model for such systems describes the effective interaction between the bigger particles in terms of a yukawa ( screened coulomb ) pair potential @xmath4 .",
    "the effects of the screening due to the neutralising medium are incorporated via the screening parameter @xmath0 .",
    "such a yukawa potential arises in , for example , the linearised poisson  boltzmann or derjaguin  landau  verwey  overbeek theories for the effective potential between spherical charged colloids in solution.@xcite the effect of the neutralising medium on the effective potential involves more than the screening effect , as described by the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "there is an additional effect of charge renormalization , whereby the amplitude of the effective potential @xmath5 is not , as one might perhaps expect from a linear treatment , proportional to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the charge on the big particles ( colloids ) , rather the amplitude of @xmath5 is proportional to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the renormalised charge.@xcite    in the present paper we are concerned with a simple model of a _ binary _ mixture of big charged particles , with both species carrying charges of the same sign , immersed in a neutralising background medium . for a general binary mixture of point yukawa particles the pair potentials are dependent on six species specific parameters .",
    "these are the dimensionless coupling parameters , @xmath10 , and the screening parameters , @xmath11 , for @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that both species experience the same screening , @xmath13 , determined by the background medium ( solvent ) , but that they have different coupling strengths .",
    "we can consider the coupling parameters to be proportional to the product of the effective charges of the species .",
    "thus we define the pair potential as @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the overall energy scale , and all three potentials are repulsive : @xmath16 . as usual",
    "it is assumed that the inter - species parameters are related to those for like particles.@xcite the berthelot mixing rule sets @xmath17 .",
    "this choice could correspond to ions with charge @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , immersed in a medium with an inverse screening length @xmath0 . in order to generalise this mixing rule",
    "we introduce a non - ideality parameter @xmath2 such that @xmath20 .",
    "the case @xmath21 clearly corresponds to the ideal system .",
    "the non - ideal case @xmath22 can be viewed as arising from charge screening effects in the double layer of condensed counter ions on the surface of the particles .",
    "the double layer leads to an effective renormalisation of the particle charge and strongly affects the particle interactions.@xcite one should expect that for some positive @xmath23 that the energy penalty incurred for unlike species to be neighbours should lead to fluid - fluid demixing at high densities ; such behaviour is found in models of soft - core fluids where positive non - additivity gives rise to demixing.@xcite    binary mixtures of h@xmath24 and he@xmath25 in a neutralising medium are expected to phase separate at temperatures and pressures of astrophysical interest  see ref .  .",
    "in this system the phase separation is thought to be due to charge neutralisation being less efficient in the mixture than in the pure phases .",
    "we believe that some of the complex screening effects associated with such systems may be incorporated in a simple model such as ours , via the parameter @xmath23 .",
    "ideal charge renormalisation effects may also be present in binary suspensions of colloids .",
    "charge renormalisation may be affected by the local concentrations of the different species of colloids and counterions in very subtle ways leading to the possibility that the amplitude of @xmath26 may not be proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "such effects would be mimicked using our simple model .",
    "it may be the case that in some colloidal fluid mixtures @xmath2 , or it may be that in other cases @xmath28 , i.e.  non - ideal charge renormalization effects may favour mixing .",
    "however , in the present paper we investigate only the cases @xmath21 and @xmath29 . using the accurate hyper - netted chain ( hnc ) approximation",
    "we find that for the case @xmath21 the total pair correlation functions @xmath30 exhibit crossover from monotonic to exponentially damped oscillatory asymptotic decay , @xmath31 , on increasing the total density of the fluid mixture at fixed composition .",
    "this scenario is equivalent to that observed in the one - component point yukawa fluid ( ocy).@xcite however , in the non - ideal case , an _",
    "infinitesimal _ positive @xmath23 can give rise to fluid - fluid phase separation at a sufficiently large total density .",
    "moreover we find that the fluid structure is changed profoundly from that pertaining to @xmath21 , i.e.  for all thermodynamic state points , apart from the limits of pure species 1 and 2 , the ultimate , @xmath31 , decay of correlations is monotonic . we find that for the particular choice @xmath32 the very simple random phase approximation ( rpa ) provides a good account of the fluid - fluid binodal and spinodal obtained from the hnc but a poor account of the detailed behaviour of the correlation functions .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in secs .",

    "we are able to calculate the corresponding poles analytically and we compare these results with those from the hnc .",
    "the pole analysis enables us to determine the behaviour of @xmath30 at intermediate range , as well as at longest range , @xmath31 .",
    "particular attention is paid to the behaviour of the correlation functions in the limit where the density of species 2 , @xmath34 . in sec .",

    "our starting point for determining the fluid structure is the mixture ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equation@xcite which relates the total correlation functions , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 are the radial distribution functions , to a set of pair direct correlation functions , @xmath37 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the bulk density of species @xmath41 .",
    "these equations can be viewed as defining the pair direct correlation functions . in order to determine the fluid structure a second relation , or closure ,",
    "is required .",
    "the simplest closure germane to the present model is the random phase approximation ( rpa ) : @xmath42 with @xmath43 , which is strictly valid only for @xmath31 .",
    "although this approximation is inadequate for hard - core model systems , it has been shown that the rpa becomes accurate for some soft - core systems at intermediate densities and exact at high densities.@xcite an important advantage of the rpa is that it does provide an analytical solution for correlation functions and for thermodynamic properties which may provide valuable physical insight into fluid behaviour .",
    "a more accurate approximation is the hyper - netted chain ( hnc ) approximation .",
    "the exact closure of the oz equations can be expressed as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an unknown bridge function.@xcite the hnc simply sets this bridge function to zero for all @xmath46 .",
    "it is found to be accurate for long - ranged or soft - core potentials,@xcite although it may fail in the neighbourhood of a spinodal .",
    "for the one - component ( point ) yukawa fluid it is known that the hnc is remarkably accurate for small coupling parameters.@xcite in order to determine the correlation functions within the hnc we use a standard iterative procedure . in what follows ,",
    "we fix the reduced temperature @xmath47 so that the state of the system is determined by the total density , @xmath48 , and the species concentrations @xmath49 .",
    "there are two procedures for determining the asymptotic , @xmath31 , behaviour of the total correlation functions .",
    "one is to examine directly the numerical solutions for @xmath30 .",
    "the alternative method is to input the direct correlation functions ( in the present case from either the rpa or hnc closures ) into the set of of oz equations ( [ eq : oz1 ] ) and perform an asymptotic analysis .",
    "the oz equations can be solved formally in fourier space and the solution written as @xmath50 where @xmath33 denotes the three - dimensional fourier transform of @xmath30 .",
    "the three functions share the same denominator @xmath51[1-\\rho_{2}\\hat{c}_{22}(q ) ] -\\rho_{1}\\rho_{2}\\hat{c}_{12}(q)^{2 } , \\label{eq : den}\\ ] ] but the numerators are dependent on the indices : @xmath52,\\nonumber\\\\ n_{22}(q)&=&\\hat{c}_{22}(q)+\\rho_{1 } [ \\hat{c}_{12}(q)^{2}-\\hat{c}_{11}(q)\\hat{c}_{22}(q)],\\label{eq : oznum}\\\\ n_{12}(q)&=&n_{21}(q)=\\hat{c}_{12}(q).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the inverse fourier transform it follows that : @xmath53 using eq.([eq : oz2 ] ) and assuming that the singularities of @xmath33 for the present yukawa systems are simple poles we are able to proceed via the residue theorem.@xcite performing contour integration around a semicircle in the upper half of the complex @xmath54 plane , we write the total correlation functions as a sum of contributions from the poles enclosed : @xmath55 where @xmath56 satisfies @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the amplitude associated with the pole @xmath59 .",
    "this amplitude is related to the residue @xmath60 of @xmath61 by @xmath62 .",
    "the poles are either purely imaginary , @xmath63 , or occur as a conjugate complex pair @xmath64 .",
    "@xcite    in general there are an infinite number of poles and contributions from many of these are required to account for the behaviour of @xmath30 at small @xmath46 .",
    "however , the ultimate , @xmath31 , decay of @xmath30 is determined by the pole that gives the slowest exponential decay , i.e.  the pole with the smallest imaginary part .",
    "this is referred to as the leading order pole .",
    "if the leading order pole is purely imaginary then @xmath65 decays exponentially , @xmath66 , as @xmath67 . on the other hand , if the leading order poles are a conjugate complex pair , then the sum of contributions from this pair of complex poles gives damped oscillatory decay , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 denote the amplitude and phase respectively.@xcite    note that whereas the wavelength @xmath71 and the decay lengths @xmath72 or @xmath73 are the same for all @xmath30 , the amplitudes and phases do depend on the indices @xmath74.@xcite however , general considerations demand @xmath75 or @xmath76 and @xmath77.@xcite in the next section we shall employ the rpa and the hnc closures to investigate the ultimate , @xmath31 , decay of @xmath30 and the behaviour of @xmath30 at intermediate distances @xmath46 .",
