    "physics have come a long way since the days of newton and galileo when it was mainly devoted to investigations of celestial bodies .",
    "today there is virtually no frontier that is forbidden to the methodology of physical investigation ; from stock - market to big bang passing thorough metereology and subatomic particles , physics tries to bring an unifying framework to the investigating mind . the mystic of brain since time immemorial , the difficulty of doing experiment in vivo , the belief that mind and brain have nothing to do with each other had prevented progress in the field until very recently .",
    "there had been in the past several classes of approach to the brain - phenomena .",
    "there has been work revolving around the theory of neural networks and dynamical systems @xcite @xcite @xcite@xmath11 these approaches have the congenital difficulty of never giving emergence of the higher brain functions or consciusness like phenomenon .",
    "then there had been conjectures that brain is quantum .",
    "this goes as far back as bohr , and as recently as r.penrose @xcite @xcite @xcite there also has been suggested mechanisms for these quantum aspects .frohlich",
    "@xcite @xcite@xmath11 the approach in this paper is distinctly different . for the very first time one",
    "is introducing the concept of @xmath12 as a quantum operator reflecting genetic identity and through the operation of this operator we have created a quantum information field .",
    "certain parts of this paper has echoes of quantum decision theories yukalov    in the last twenty years or so there has been an explosion of sophisticated experimental techniques like magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) , positron emission spectroscopy ( pet ) , near - infra - red spectroscopy ( nirs ) , electroencephalography ( eeg ) , magnetoencephalography ( meg ) along with computerised tomography & variety of multi - modal imaging to track diseases of the brain but also study neural anatomy as well as its response to a variety of stimuli .",
    "one can now study some of the brain activity in - situ as well as in real time ( fmri can produce four images every second .",
    "the brain takes half a second to to be conscious of stimuli ) . since the pioneering activity of the noted brain surgeon wilder penfield@xcite who introduced electrodes into the brain to chart out the somato - sensory map of the cortex and elicited memory pattern by proper excitation of neural region ,",
    "neurologists today are capable of pinpointing their electrode on one single neuron and observe what happens .    today we know a great deal about neurons , the primary agent that carry signals to and fro between world outside and our brain inside.the human brain is estimated to have about a hundred billion nerve cells or neurons , two million miles of axons that take the signal down to its near neighbors and a million billion synapses , the switch that connects one neuron with another @xcite .",
    "knowledge about the physiology and the architecture of dendrites , neurons and their axons with its synapse has developed enormously over a century @xcite .",
    "we now know that behind every single set of information , feeling , sensation , thought or action , a set of neurons are involved and that there is no reason to live in the twilight of cartesian duality @xcite of relegating brain in some physical space and mind elsewhere in some mental space",
    ". it would be simpler to assume that both space is contained in the same hilbert space where reality is played out whether it is all measurable or not and that all of which goes on in the brain is negotiated by the incessant flickering of these myriads of neurons , some of them firing in unison , in a pattern with perfect inner coherence .",
    "their populations as well as their connections are evolutive , never static , always adapting , developing according to ebb and flow of information from the outside world as well as to the needs of the living self .",
    "everything that we do , whether experiencing an event or an emotion as we listen to ravi shankar or beethoven , our thought whether sublime or murderous , our imagination , our desire , our acting out our will , every single thing that becomes fabric of our mind is so because of this neural network that subtends the mental space , that sherrington had named the ` enchanted loom'@xcite .",
    "we assume that there is no little ` man ' or a homunculus sitting in a corner of the brain , pulling the strings of some cartesian theater.the hilbert space @xcite where quantum mechanics acts out , is also the mental space of brain . in this space",
    "new quantum operators will be defined and asked to operate in perfect accordance with the laws of causality and of thermodynamics .    on 15th january 2008",
    ", a monkey standing on a treadmill in a u.s neurology laboratorywith electrodes planted in some of her motor neurons made history by making a robot stationed in tokyo move its legs  by the simple transfer of the energy of her thoughts @xcite .",
    "the day is not far when paralytics will be able to control artificial hands and legs through their thoughts alone.our central assumption is based on the simple belief that thoughts and emotions carry energy and as such physics of consciousness can be constructed from first principles .",
    "we consider that actions of the mind can be formulated through quantum mechanical formulation , with operators operating on hilbert space which is an extension of what we call our physical hilbert space .",
    "we shall show why the quantum description is appropriate here : continuous deformation of neural medium is postulated to lead to discrete energy packets that we identify as information in the mind.the quantum operators that we shall introduce are _ _  operators of self__. we designate them by @xmath13 since they create states or information like particles for cognitive functions @xmath14 .",
    "it is these states we shall define as forming the armature of the _",
    "mental space_. we will show that these states are formed by fundamental excitations or discrete information quanta that we call infons .",
    "infons are considered to be excitation out of mind field .",
    "these excitations are taken to be boson like because a great number of them can be imagined to be packed into a given function .",
    "these are taken to be indistinguishible particles .",
    "this fundamental indistinguishibility seperates quantum mechanics from classical mechanics ; the classical particles move in distinguishable space - time orbits which can be tracked continuously while this is not true of quantum objects.from mental space we go to neural space and assume that neurons vehicle these excitations , that they can be exchanged from one neuron to another . only when these boson - like information packets develop a coherent macroscopic character by organising themselves into distinct states or functions @xmath15 , that we become aware of them as distinguishable entities , as joy or pain or as good or bad .",
    "we can use the analogy with electrons ; they are indistinguihable particles . but the way they organise , as they go from hydrogen atom to  uranium , forming distinguishable orbits that each atom becomes different from its constituting electrons and eventually completely different , from each other giving us the infinitely rich periodic table of elements .",
    "our objective is to generate a global macroscopic coherent state of information for the brain by repeated application of these @xmath13 operators using a neuron  or assembly of neurons to organise these function states .",
    "we show that a macroscopic global coherent state of the cognitive space will emerge .",
    "this coherent state is the eigenfunction of the global @xmath13 operator and whose eigenvalue is brain s cognitive order parameter .",
    "the resultant phase coherence is key to the whole smooth cortical synchrony or symphony .    in the next section",
    "we develop the phenomenology of the coherent brain state . in section @xmath16",
    ", we present the coherent state for a single cognitive function @xmath17 and go on to form a global coherent state out of a bouquet of functions . to do so , we use the coherent state formalism , due to glauber , so called glauber state@xcite .",
    "we replace the ` real brain ' by an organised neuron network of neurons in the cortex communicating with each other through their synaptic connections .",
    "we take a model brain , containing a lattice of _ synaptic sites in the cortex _ connected with each other through axon terminals that gather its input through a mesh of dendrites .",
    "this is a far cry from the highly complex human brain that has evolved over several hundred thousand years since the homo sapiens .",
    "we show how such an assembly has phase coherence naturally built in and that stays in man all his life .",
    "it is at this stage that the global @xmath13 operator develops a macroscopic value and a non - zero average value @xmath18 _ _",
    "the central idea of this paper , consists in identifying this  operator average as our quintessential self . _ _ an internal executor emerges in our mind , the @xmath19  that most people say they feel exists inside their head !    in the subsection",
    "@xmath20 we will write down the thermodynamic arguments of the emergence of this @xmath21 @xmath22 and associated spontaneous symmetry breaking .    in the section @xmath23 ,",
    "_ we introduce the novel idea that what we call consciousness is nothing but a cognitive response of the neural brain to the world .",
    "_ this response function or cognitive susceptibility will be defined in terms of these operators and applied to different states of the brain .",
    "section @xmath24 will discuss some of these results .",
    "we may summarise this introduction by reiterating that our objective is not whether physics can solve some of the problems of human brain ( it probably ca nt , like anybody else ! ) but whether it will allow us to think reasonably about some of these problems .",
    "the noted eighteenth century french physician  pierre cabannis once said that ` brain secretes thought as liver secretes bile ' @xcite .",
    "this is almost true .",
    "actually the function of the brain is to create representation of the world out of the flood of incoming electro - chemical signals that neurons vehicle ; these signals are basically all alike yet their representations in our mind are indescribable in their infinite richness and variety .",
    "mental space is taken to be a quantum information field and we suggest that a normal functioning brain is a coherent state of this field . why quantum and not classical ?",
    "we ought to precise what kind of a quantum particle are we considering an information to be electron like or photon like ? this is a legitimate question since the classical and quantum limits of these two elementary particles are slghtly different",
    ". electromagnetic theory of maxwell derived its analogy from classical fluid motion .",
    "clasical electromagnetic theory works because in a classical light beam millions of photons are involved where photon occupation is a continuous variable .",
    "one did not worry about discrete nature of this number , neither did one know that a single photon existed .",
    "hence in this limit quantum theory or corpuscular description was not needed and wave description was adequate . as far as electron went , in the beginning , it was just the very opposite.the electron was just a particle and like any other particle had a mass living at some point in space and time with a definite velocity or momentum and obeyed newton s laws of motion .",
    "it was perfectly classical .",
    "its quantum wave nature was discovered much later with scrodinger and de broglie and then came with it , the heisenberg uncertainties of not knowing simultaneously its position and momentum .",
    "it is one of the paradox of quantum mechanics that one can hardly describe a single photon or able to write a wave function for a single photon .",
    "neither can one localise a photon .",
    "it was shown very early wigner that this difficulty came from the fact that there was no position operator for a photon . as a result , a single photon s probability density or probability amplitude , its wave function at a space point can neither be written down or normalised to unity over the space .",
    "a quantum particle on the contrary can be described perfectly by the schrodinger wave function @xmath25 and like an electron can be localised .",
    "its probability density given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the probability amplitude to find the particle at a space point @xmath28 , is perfectly normalisable and is a conserved quantity .",
    "the choice we have made is to take information as a discrete particle like object rather than like a photon .",
    "we consider that in a normal human brain only an infinitesimally small amont of neural space is occupied by these particles and as a result classical wave description like that of a light beam is inappropriate . on the other hand",
    "why do we think that these particles are quantum like than classical ?",
    "one of the principal characteristic of a classical particle that it can be prepared precisely at a space point @xmath29 with a precise momentum @xmath30 .",
    "the limits of precision can be as fine as we want and is @xmath31 this is basically because @xmath28 & @xmath32 are independent quantities for a classical particle and we can vary one without varying the other . we can measure one without disturbing the other and we can measure both at the same time .",
    "all this is not true of a quantum particle .",
    "the two quanties @xmath28 and @xmath32 are not indepenedent for a quantum object ,",
    "they are conjugate . they do not commute which means that these two quantities can not be measured simultaneously and if one measures @xmath28 one disturbs @xmath32 and vice versa@xmath11this brings an uncertainty in the measurement given bythe famous heisenberg s relationship @xmath33    here @xmath34 is the planck s constant . for a classical particle",
    "if we prepared it at the point @xmath29 it would remain there eternally unless acted upon by external force which is newton s equation of motion . for a quantum particle on the other hand , if we did the same thing and we insist on the particle being immobile at @xmath29 it will not do so .",
    "there will be one or two things : either we will find the particle at @xmath29 but we will find it at wild values of @xmath35 or we will find it with a momentum @xmath35 but its location will be anywhere in the space , with a probability given by the schrodinger wave function @xmath36 a classical baby in the cradle will remain in the cradle while a quantum baby will not remain localised but will ooze away , much to the consternation of the mother ( but since @xmath37.@xmath38 mother is bound to find her baby ) !",
    "there is a fundamental reason for this quantum behaviour . in classical physics particle motion",
    "is deterministic , determined by laws of newton , governing a paricle s position and its velocity .",
    "these laws are explained by hamilton s principle which says that trajectory a particle will choose is determined by the principle of least action ; of all the possible paths a particle may take , the most probable one is the one that costs least action .",
    "this least action path is the only path that a classical particle will take ( path @xmath39 of @xmath40 figure 1@xmath41 .",
    "if we consider the action path as a possible program , a classical information particle will execute the same program again and again . by its very nature our mind and",
    "consequently our brain is supposed to have free will .",
    "this means that there is no guarantee an information particle will take the least action path in order to execute a given function .",
    "it may well choose a variety of paths of which the least action path is just one .",
    "many of its paths will go over higher energy hills and sum total of these excursions constitute the feynman path integrals   @xcite .at any instant of time @xmath42 ( see figure [ fig : classical ] ) the information particle may well stray away from its classical path @xmath39 ( point @xmath43 and be found on points indicated on the trajectories @xmath44 , although its field amplitude @xmath45 must obey @xmath46 getting away from the classical path , gives these information particles an infinite degrees of mental freedom , which is the reason why we can suddenly change our mind in course of an action and take a completely different path .",
    "a computer as it is today does not have free will and is condemned to obey the programs that had been prewritten .",
    "a computer is classical even if it borrows neo - classical algorithms for its functioning .",
    "it is in this strict sense information particles are quantum objects .",
    "_ what their paths minimise is certainly not action but perhaps risks involved in the action and mind will choose the path of minimum risk .",
    "_    an information particle is created at some synaptic site @xmath47 but it does not remain localised there ; it hops from synapse to synapse and evetually joins other information bits to create a coherent message .",
    "it is hopeless to ask where a specific bit of information resides ; it is delocalised , it is disincarnate , it is everywhere and nowhere .",
    "coherent cognitive functions they perform can be localised and are identifiable in space and time but , not the information bits themselves .",
    "_ this is why mental space is a quantum information field_. these quantum particles can only be generated by application of some operator on some occupation number vectors that describe the hilbert space of the mind .",
    "only a quantum description will be able to capture the underlying physics .    to start with",
    ", we have the electro - chemical signals that are coming through different sensory channels , which seem perfectly banal , varying only in its intensity ( frequency ) and duration and yet each one will become a discrete excitation or a bit of information , exactly where and how nobody knows .",
    "probably the transformation ( transmutation or transcription ) occurs at the somatic center of each neuron from where it will go out towards other neurons through its axon as an action potential eventually to its synapse.the scenario of `` information '' generation in the brain may be following .",
    "neural medium in the brain reacts to the changing electro - chemical potential of its surrounding neurons whenever it is disturbed by the outside world .",
    "this disturbance generates a wave like oscillation pattern in the medium that the mind perceives as a sensation or `` information '' coming in .",
    "_ a plane monochromatic distortion wave can carry no information _ ; this is equally true of a monochromatic light beam that can not transport any signal , unless it is frequency or amplitude modulated .",
    "if the `` _ _ meaning _ _ '' vector of a distortion wave is taken as amplitude of some perfectly sinusoidal wave pattern , then evidently , summed over a few oscillation , the meaning adds to zero for a monochromatic wave of wavelength @xmath48 basically an organism is being bombarded incessantly with facts , whose sum total information content is zero . on the other hand , several wave lengths or facts",
    "may be called upon to interfere constructively , so that in a small space of extension @xmath49 a large local amplitude ( `` information '' ) will develop if the spread in wave number @xmath50 @xmath51 is sufficiently large . out of the babel of noise or constant chattering of neurons ,",
    "a discrete information bit emerges.the `` information '' bit ( it is a minimum uncertainty condition because brain likes to minimise uncertainty , whose unit is @xmath34 ) is considered to be a discrete quantum object that _ we have called an infon . _ from a background of a very agitated noisy neural medium , one information quantum detaches itself almost by accident , a quantum particle that organism finds suddenly very precious to posses .",
    "meaning out of a random sea of facts is an evolutionary event , revolutionary also , nothing less nothing more but this led to cognition .",
    "this may very well be an acceptable scenario to start with .",

    "the infons are considered to be identical .",
    "this is so if and only if they are excitations of the same underlying field . the often asked question `` why all electrons are identical '' arises from mistakenly regarding individual electrons as fundamental objects , when in fact it is the underlying electron field that is fundamental .",
    "the same is true of infon particles with respect to the underlying field which we call our mind .",
    "quantum mechanics , in its most general formulation , is a theory of abstract operators ( observables ) acting on an abstract state space ( hilbert space ) , where the observables represent physically observable quantities and the state space represents the possible states of our system . each observable can be taken as a possible degree of freedom .",
    "a classical field contains only a limited number of degrees of freedom ( a classical electromagnetic field has only two , local electrical and magnetic field vectors ) .",
    "a quantum field has unlimited , possibly infinite degres of freedom .",

    "the highest energy functional state is the cognition whose ground state representation we shall now construct .",
    "phase coherence between infon particles which in turn gives rise to inter - functional coherence is a result of constructive interference between infon particles .",
    "this would not happen if these were classical particles which never interfere and where each go their own way .",
    "it is in this inner sense that mental space can be considered as a quantum field .",
    "we can describe the mental field in two ways . either in terms of mental state wave functions in the fock space @xmath58 where @xmath15 is the label of a whole collection of states that are expected to be grouped into distinct cognitive functions @xmath59 as defined below .",
