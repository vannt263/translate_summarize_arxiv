    "accurate evaluation of free energy of a crystal phase by simulation is important to predict many important thermodynamic properties including the melting temperature ,  @xcite the relative stability of different crystal phases  @xcite ( i.e. , polymorphism ) , and the interfacial free energy of crystal phases .",
    "@xcite a common method of free energy evaluation is thermodynamic integration ( tdi ) , in which an external potential is imposed on the crystal phase to ensure thermodynamic reversibility ,  @xcite and the method requires that the resulting free energy change be computed accurately .",
    "however , the external potential causes center of mass ( cm ) position of the crystal phase to change relative to that in the absence of the external potential and this leads to hysteresis in the free energy computation .",
    "this problem has been reported to occur in many tdi methods including einstein crystal method ,  @xcite constrained fluid @xmath0-integration method ,  @xcite surface free energy calculation of crystal phases ,  @xcite and direct computation of crystal - melt interfacial energy by cleaving wall method .",
    "@xcite    a variety of constraints are imposed on the translational degrees of freedom of the crystal phase to address this problem . in einstein crystal method ,",
    "cm is fixed during thermodynamic integration along the path .",

    "@xcite a fixed particle constraint was also proposed for this method .",
    "@xcite in surface free energy calculation of au[110 ] crystal phase ,  @xcite cm velocity was artificially controlled by the ( otherwise ) dormant external potential during molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation . in the computation of crystal - melt interfacial energy @xmath1 ,",
    "two crystal layers were immobilized by assigning them an infinite mass throughout the four stage integration path .",
    "@xcite it can be seen from the above examples that although cause of the hysteresis is the same , every tdi path requires its own ad - hoc procedure to constrain the translational degrees of freedom of the crystal phase .",
    "further , the use of a constraint entails computation of the correction term to obtain free energy difference between the unconstrained phases . in case of einstein crystal method ,  @xcite",
    "the correction term can be computed analytically and the effort required is minimal .",
    "when cm is confined to a small region in constrained fluid @xmath0-integration method , the correction term needs to be computed by separate simulations .",
    "@xcite in cleaving wall method ,  @xcite @xmath1 was computed for two different system sizes in order to determine the effect of the constraint .",
    "thus , the estimation of the correction term is , in itself , computationally expensive in many cases .    in this article",

    "@xcite next , we compute the free energy difference resulting from the imposition of an attractive gaussian well potential on the crystal phase in constrained fluid @xmath0-integration method .  @xcite both calculations are performed for the stillinger and weber  @xcite potential of silicon . finally , we summarize our results and discuss further possible applications of this methodology in sec . iv .",
    "in this section , we first describe the bennett acceptance ratio method  @xcite ( bar ) which is routinely employed to compute the free energy difference between two states .",
    "@xcite we then describe the error biased bennett acceptance ratio ( ebar ) method in the context of the present problem . according to the bar method ,",
    "@xcite helmholtz free energy difference @xmath2 between two equilibrium states ` 0 ' and ` 1 ' is given by the following equation :  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a constant , @xmath5 is the fermi function , @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the sums over fermi functions sampled in ` 0 ' and ` 1 ' ensembles , respectively . the symbols @xmath8 and @xmath9 in eq .  ( [ eq : bar1 ] ) represent the total configurational energies and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the number of sampled fermi functions in the above two ensembles",
    ". please note that we have expressed @xmath12 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath4 in units of @xmath13 and we will follow this convention throughout unless otherwise stated explicitly . the error ( in units of @xmath13 ) in the free energy estimate",
    "is given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the expectation ( correct ) value of the free energy difference .",
    "when we are in the large sample regime ( i.e. , both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are reasonably accurate ) , the variance can be approximated as  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ensemble average of @xmath18 evaluated in ensemble 0 and @xmath19 is the ensemble average of @xmath20 evaluated in ensemble 1 .",
    "bennett showed that the value of @xmath21 which minimizes @xmath22 is given by the following expression  @xcite @xmath23 this value of @xmath4 corresponds to the condition  @xcite that @xmath24 .",

    "( i ) the important configurations must overlap to a large extent with those of state 0 , which is possible if the external potential does not affect the crystal structure significantly .",

    "the important values of the perturbation energy @xmath33 are those for which the cm position is @xmath34 ( corresponding to the state 1 ) and are therefore not likely to be sampled in a simulation of reasonable length because the cm position can fluctuate wildly in state 0 due to the absence of the external potential .",

    "the cleaving is done by introducing a repulsive wall consisting of one or more ideal crystal layers .",

    "thermodynamic integration was performed with the same interfacial area but with fewer crystal layers and the resulting value of @xmath1 was found to be in agreement within error bars with that of the larger system , which indicated that no correction term was necessary .",
    "@xcite however , computation of @xmath1 for two different system sizes is computationally expensive since it involves implementation of all four stages of the cleaving wall method .",
    "we , therefore , explored the possibility that using ebar method , we may be able to compute free energy accurately without the need to immobilize particles in the crystal layers .",
    "we performed the computation for ( 111 ) orientation of the silicon crystal phase , since for this orientation the layers on the opposite sides of the cleaving plane are not symmetric . as a result , when the cm of the crystal phase fluctuates , it results in fluctuation of the cleaving potential , thus leading to hysteresis . for ( 100 )",
    "orientation , this problem does not occur because of the symmetry of layers on the opposite sides of the cleaving plane . as in ref .  , we employed crystal phase with 3024 particles and a simulation box with dimensions of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the unit cell length of the crystal phase and @xmath67 is the crystal density .",

    "the cleaving potential consisted of a repulsive two - body term and a 3-body term derived from stillinger and weber potential as explained in ref .  .",
    "the cleaving wall was constructed of two ideal crystal layers of ( 111 ) orientation with 36 particles in each layer .",
    "@xcite the cleaving planes were located at two boundaries of the simulation box in z - direction .",

    "we found the value of t@xmath144 to be @xmath148 k , based on ebar ( combined ) result with @xmath88 .",
    "this is in close agreement with the value of @xmath61  k obtained in ref .   by crystal - melt coexistence simulations for si(100 ) interface and the value of @xmath149 k obtained in ref .",
    "in this work , we have shown that ebar method efficiently calculates the free energy of the crystal phase due to an external potential without requiring use of a constraint on the translational degrees of freedom . in this method , we nullify the error incurred due to poor sampling of the perturbation energy in state 0 ( crystal phase without the external potential ) by adjusting the value of the shift constant @xmath4 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : bar1 ] ) ] so that the error in estimated free energy difference is completely due to state 1 ( the state in which an external potential acts on the crystal phase ) , where we expect the sampling of the perturbation energy to be sufficiently accurate .",
    "we have applied this technique to cleaving wall method , in which the crystal phase is subjected to a repulsive cleaving potential  @xcite and confined fluid @xmath0-integration method ,  @xcite in which the crystal phase is acted upon by attractive gaussian potential wells located at the ideal crystal lattice sites . in both cases",
    ", we found that ebar method yields accurate values with reasonable computational effort and and offers considerably improvement over both the single stage fep method ( in state 1 ) and the bar method .",
    "note that unlike the fep method , the ebar method utilizes information from both the ensembles .",
    "it must be stressed that the ebar method is applicable only when the bar result is in the small sample regime .",
    "thus , the domains of applicability of the two methods are mutually exclusive . with regard to the convergence",
    ", we found that the ebar method ceases to be accurate in the following limits : ( i ) when the external potential is too weak so that the cm position is not localized as seen in cleaving wall method ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] and table  [ tab : t1 ] ) and ( ii ) when the external potential is too strong so as to affect the crystal structure significantly as in the case of constrained fluid @xmath0-integration method ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f8 ] and table  [ tab : t1 ] ) . both of these conditions increase the error the computation of @xmath7 ( corresponding to the state in which external potential is acting ) .",
    "the ebar method is simple to implement since it only requires that the perturbation energies in the two states be sampled and does not depend upon the existence of a reversible path connecting the two states .    in the constrained fluid @xmath0-integration method ,",
    "thermodynamic integration by gq technique is found to be effective since the cm hysteresis is confined to the end of the integration path ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] ) .",
    "however , the gq technique suffers from the inherent drawback of the tdi method in that it depends upon the existence of a reversible path between the two thermodynamic states .",
    "also , testing the convergence of this technique is relatively expensive since the abscissa values for higher number of integration points do not coincide with those corresponding to lower number of integration points .",
    "@xcite these problems prevent general applicability of the gq technique , as in the case of the cleaving wall method where the cm hysteresis occurs throughout the path ( see fig .  [",

    "we expect that ebar method will also be useful in computing bulk crystal phase free energy by einstein crystal method  @xcite and in computing surface free energy of crystal phases  @xcite where the cm hysteresis occurs .",
