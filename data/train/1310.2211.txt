    "the formation of a gaseous envelope around a planetary core has been studied , for over thirty years , by means of spherically symmetric one - dimensional ( 1d ) calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most of the current knowledge about the process relies on such calculations . at early stages , the growth rate of the envelope is controlled by its own cooling rate , up the point where envelope and core mass are about equal .",
    "thereafter , the growth is much more rapid and proceeds through a phase of hydrodynamical collapse , limited exclusively by disk supply . to date",
    ", the million - year evolution that is required to grow a planetary embryo into a giant planet can only be modeled via 1d calculations .",
    "a number of properties and physical effects , however , can not be accounted for or described by invoking spherical symmetry and are therefore approximated , imposed , or simply neglected in 1d models . the envelope radius , for example ,",
    "can only be introduced as a parameter , since it depends on the thermal and gravitational energy of the gas outside the envelope @xcite .",
    "the density and temperature at the outer boundary are approximated to average values in the unperturbed disk , whereas the actual ( perturbed ) disk values depend also on the planet mass .",
    "rotation , often neglected , can be included to some extent , but not constrained .",
    "although the gas dynamics of a disk away from a planet can be characterized as plane - parallel reasonably well , the flow becomes inherently three - dimensional ( 3d ) as it approaches the planet @xcite .",
    "part of this flow eventually feeds the envelope and breaks the spherical symmetry of the outer layers through transfer of angular and radial momentum , which may induce rotation and radial mixing .",
    "3d models of envelopes that account for the interactions of the planet with the disk can in principle overcome all the limitations of 1d models .",
    "however , the computational overhead is so large that it is not yet feasible to go beyond evolution times of order @xmath6@xmath7 years , depending on the orbital distance . at the moment ,",
    "3d calculations can only be used to investigate particular epochs of the core and envelope growth .",
    "nonetheless , they can provide a wealth of information , otherwise not accessible through 1d models , which can help adjust and/or refine 1d calculations .",
    "the scope of this paper is to study one such epoch , early during the planet evolution when the accretion of solids is still relatively large and the envelope mass is much smaller than the core mass .",
    "we show that there is general consistency between 3d and 1d calculations and that 3d calculations can indeed address the physics missing in spherically symmetric models .",
    "local 3d calculations of planetary envelopes with radiation hydrodynamics were carried out by @xcite .",
    "there are several similarities to our study but also important differences .",
    "for example , the local approach can not capture the thermodynamics of the gas in and around the horse - shoe orbit region , which supplies the planet with gas and affects the dynamics of the accretion flow .",
    "they used an interstellar dust opacity , scaled down by numerical factors , whereas we compute the dust opacity based on a grain size distribution that may be more appropriate for circumstellar disks .",
    "they concentrated on somewhat larger core masses , and for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 earth - mass ( @xmath8 ) cases they used core radii about @xmath1 times larger than the physical radii .",
    "they did not account for energy delivery by solids accretion .",
    "recently , @xcite performed high - resolution , local calculations of the envelope region surrounding planetary cores of @xmath9 , applying an isothermal and an adiabatic equation of state .",
    "the differences between the above - cited simulations and the calculations presented here are such as to render any comparison unfeasible . until now",
    ", global 3d calculations of planets embedded in disks with radiation hydrodynamics have been used to investigate tidal torques exerted on the planet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , but never the details of the planet envelope and of the envelope - disk interactions .",

    "the dust opacity of the outer layers of the envelope is different , typically lower in the 1d models .",
