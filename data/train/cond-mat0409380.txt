    "comparatively few studies have focused on electrostatic interactions between pe brush - coated surfaces .",
    "interactions between neutral surfaces  both planar and curved ( spherical )  with grafted pe brushes have been modeled using scaling theory  @xcite , while interactions between charged surfaces coated with oppositely - charged pes have been investigated for planar  @xcite and spherical ( colloidal ) surfaces  @xcite via monte carlo simulation and a variety of theoretical methods .    while microscopic models that include chain and microion degrees of freedom provide the most realistic description of pe brushes , simulation of such explicit models for more than one or two brushes can be computationally demanding . the purpose of the present paper is to develop an alternative , coarse - grained theoretical approach , based on the concept of effective interactions , which may prove useful for predicting thermodynamic and other bulk properties of suspensions of pe brush - coated colloids .",

[ pebrush ] ) .",
    "the core is assumed to be neutral , the macroion charge coming entirely from the pe shell . assuming a symmetric electrolyte and equal salt and counterion valences , the electrolyte contains @xmath10 point salt ions of charge @xmath7 and @xmath10 of charge @xmath11 .",

    "the solvent is treated as a dielectric continuum of dielectric constant @xmath19 , which acts only to reduce the strength of coulomb interactions between ions .    in pe solutions ,",
    "the counterions can be classified into four regions : ( 1 ) those within narrow tubes enclosing the pe chains , of radius comparable to the bjerrum length , @xmath20 ; ( 2 ) those outside of the tubes but still closely associated with the chains ; ( 3 ) those not closely associated with the chains , but still inside of the pe shells ; and ( 4 ) those entirely outside of the macroions .",
    "counterions in regions ( 1)-(3 ) can be regarded as trapped by the macroions , while those in region ( 4 ) are free to move throughout the suspension . within region ( 1 )",

    "these chain - localized ( condensed or mobile ) counterions tend to distribute uniformly along , and partially neutralize , the chains . in our model ,",
    "counterions in regions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) act to renormalize the bare macroion valence .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 thus should be physically interpreted as an _ effective _ macroion valence , generally much lower than the bare valence ( number of ionizable monomers ) . from the manning counterion condensation criterion",
    "@xcite , according to which the linear charge density of a pe chain saturates at @xmath21 , we can expect the bare charge in an aqueous solution to be renormalized down by at least an order of magnitude .    the local number density profiles of charged monomers in the pe brushes , @xmath22 , and of counterions , @xmath23 , are modeled here as continuous , spherically symmetric distributions .",
    "charge discreteness can be reasonably neglected if we ignore structure on length scales shorter than the minimum separation between charges .",

    "the model thus neglects configurational entropy of the pe chains , although it does include the entropy of the microions .",
    "for the model suspension defined above , our goal is to predict distributions of microions inside and outside of the pe brushes and effective interactions between macroions . adapting the general response theory approach previously applied to charged colloids  @xcite and pe solutions  @xcite , we reduce the multi - component mixture to an equivalent one - component system governed by effective interactions , and approximate the effective one - component hamiltonian via perturbation theory . to simplify notation",
