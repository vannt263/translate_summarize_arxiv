    "[ n0581cmdanalysis ] ]    the shape of the initial mass function ( imf ) is an important parameter to understand the fragmentation of molecular clouds and therefore the formation and development of stellar systems . besides studies of the solar neighbourhood ( salpeter @xcite , tsujimoto et al .",
    "@xcite ) , work on star clusters plays an important role ( scalo @xcite ) , as age , metalicity , and distance of all cluster stars can be assumed to be equal .",
    "most of the previous studies indicate that the imf of a star cluster has the shape of power laws @xmath5 within different mass intervals .",
    "the following typical values of their exponents as given in scalo ( @xcite ) : @xmath6 knowledge of membership is essential to derive the imf especially of open star clusters , where the contamination of the data with field stars is a major problem .",
    "two methods for membership determination are in use nowadays and each of them has its advantages and disadvantages :    * the classical method is to separate between cluster and field stars by their proper motions : all cluster stars can be expected to move in the same way , whereas the field stars show more widely spread and differently centred proper motions ( see e.g.  the recent work of francic @xcite ) . for each star",
    "a membership probability can be specified . to obtain a sufficient epoch difference , old as well as recent photographic plates",
    "are needed to measure proper motions , so that this method is limited by the comparably poor sensitivity of the old plates . * with the introduction of ccd imaging to astronomy , statistical field star subtraction became more popular . assuming ( almost ) identical field star distributions in the cluster region itself and the surrounding area , the distribution of the field stars can be subtracted from the one of the ( contaminated ) cluster area .",
    "this makes sense for fainter stars but with the bright stars one deals with statistics of small numbers .",
    "our work combines these two methods of membership determination : the proper motions are investigated for the bright stars of the cluster , whereas the fainter stars are treated with statistical field star subtraction . from the cleaned data we derive the luminosity and mass functions of the cluster .",
    "ngc581 ( m103 ) , which is located at @xmath7 , @xmath8 , was chosen as a first test object for our technique because the cluster _ and _ a sufficiently large field star region can be covered within the field of view of the telescope used . a @xmath3 image of ngc581 is shown in fig .",

    "the photometry is based on 22 ccd frames taken in johnson @xmath9 and @xmath3 filters at the 1 m cassegrain telescope of hoher list observatory .",
    "the telescope was equipped with a focal reducing system and a 2k @xmath10 2k ccd camera called holicam ( sanner et al .",

    "after standard image processing the photometry was performed with daophot ii ( stetson @xcite ) running under iraf .",

    "as crowding is not a problem in our images , the completeness in the field and cluster regions are the same so that it is not necessary to correct for completeness before the field star subtraction .    with artificial star experiments using the daophot ii routine addstar we derived the completeness function shown in fig .",

    "we included all stars with a mass of higher than @xmath33 ( corresponding to the previously mentioned value of @xmath34 or @xmath35 ) . in this range ,",

    "198 stars were selected by this criterion .",
    "the stars were divided in @xmath36 wide bins .",

    "[ n0581imfplot ] .",
    "the single star with a mass around @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) was not taken into account for the imf determination , since this single object at one end of the histogram might heavily influence the imf slope .",
    "the slope of the imf was determined by linear regression to the histogram .",
    "we obtained @xmath41 from the stars with a mass from @xmath42 to @xmath43 ( an experiment including the @xmath39 star led to @xmath44 and therefore to a difference in the exponent of more than 0.3 ! ) .",

    "ngc581 is a young open star cluster with an age of 16 myr .",
    "it is located at a distance of 2900 pc from the sun .",
    "we derived proper motions of 228 stars in the region of the cluster down to @xmath46 .",
    "77 of those can be considered members of the object . a study of the imf of ngc581 leads to a power law with a slope of @xmath2 .",
    "the results of the photometry mainly coincide with the findings of phelps & janes ( @xcite ) , however , we do not find evidence for a star formation over a period of as long as 10 myr : while phelps & janes claim the necessity of two isochrones of different ages to fit both the blue and red bright stars in their cmd , the geneva @xmath47 isochrone fits all features of our cmd sufficiently well .",
    "the imf slope might be slightly higher than scalo s ( @xcite ) figure for this mass range , as phelps & janes ( @xcite ) find a steep slope for ngc581 , too .",
    "their value of @xmath48 marks the steepest imf of their entire study of open star clusters .",
    "although their imf is based on a photometry with a deeper limiting magnitude , our determination has its advantages , too : phelps & janes only used statistical field star subtraction and no information of proper motions , which may have great impact on the high mass range and therefore might affect the slope of the imf .",
    "furthermore , they only took one single region in the vicinity of their star clusters for the field star subtraction , while we were able to use the surrounding of the cluster itself . and",
    "finally , their field of view is so small that they probably did not cover the entire cluster which , assuming the presence of mass segregation , might have flattened their imf due to a lack of low mass stars from the outer regions of the cluster .    if we would not have based part of the membership determination on the proper motions , we would have ended up with 9 more stars in the magnitude range of @xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "[ n0581vergleich ] ) .",
    "since the total star number in this region is low , this would have decreased the imf the slope to @xmath50 . within the errors ,",
    "this result would still match with our value above , however , the shape of this imf is less well represented by a power law , which is expressed by the higher error .",
    "therefore we claim that adding the information of the field star subtraction did improve the reliability of our imf study .",
