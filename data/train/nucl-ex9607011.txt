    "recent computational advances in the field of few - nucleon dynamics have fueled renewed interest in the three - nucleon and four - nucleon systems @xcite .",

    "similar calculations are currently available for the 3n continuum , and extension to the 4n continuum is under active investigation .",
    "the continuum calculations may prove especially revealing , because here exists a fundamental difference between the three- and four - nucleon systems : three - nucleon systems have no excited states whereas the four - nucleon system has many .",
    "these states ( resonances ) may exhibit sensitivity to the dynamics of the nucleon - nucleon interaction and their modification in the presence of the nuclear medium .",
    "however , confirming the existence , and determining the quantum numbers of these resonances is a challenging experimental problem .",
    "the level scheme proposed as part of a recent review article @xcite has 15 levels at excitations 2030 mev above the ground state .",
    "for the most part these resonances do not appear as sharp structure in any scattering or reaction observable , and polarization measurements are essential for determining the scattering amplitudes .",
    "while there have been many studies of single polarization observables in 4n systems , there is very little data with _ both _ polarized target _ and _ polarized beam .",
    "only two measurements have been reported . in 1966 ,",
    "passell and schermer measured the transmission of polarized thermal neutrons through a polarized @xmath2he target @xcite , and more recently , alley and knutsen studied @xmath13-@xmath2he spin - correlation data @xcite . in the first experiment , the thermal cross section is completely dominated by a single ( @xmath14 ) subthreshold resonance in the @xmath12he compound nucleus , and no information on the higher - energy resonances was obtained .",
    "the second experiment covered a much broader region in the @xmath11 continuum , but was sensitive only to the isotriplet scattering states . no previous polarized target ",
    "polarized beam experiment has fully explored a wide range of 4n excited states .    in this paper",
    "we report measurements of the longitudinal and transverse neutron total cross - section differences @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "these two spin observables are directly related to the forward elastic - scattering amplitude through the optical theorem @xcite . as such , they allow for a simple interpretation in terms of the properties of the scattering states .",

    "the formalism necessary to describe the neutron total cross section for polarized target and polarized beam has been developed and discussed in an earlier paper  @xcite . for the sake of clarity we briefly review the results of that paper in the following section .",
    "the parity - conserving , time - reversal invariant part of the forward elastic scattering amplitude allows the neutron total cross section for spin-1/2 nuclei to be expressed as @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the unpolarized neutron total cross section , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the @xmath19th projection of the beam ( target ) polarization axis , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the longitudinal and transverse total cross - section differences .",
    "the latter may be represented pictorially as @xmath20 and @xmath21 the measurements of @xmath7 and @xmath8 reported here were performed separately , with both beam and target polarized along axes longitudinal to the incident beam direction ( i.e. along the @xmath22 axis ) or transverse to the beam direction ( i.e. along the @xmath23 axis ) .",
    "hence in subsequent discussion , the superscripts used to indicate the polarization axes will be dropped .    an accurate determination of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 observables does not require an absolute measurement of the total cross section . rather , the cross - section differences may be extracted from transmission measurements of polarized neutrons through the polarized target .",

    "detailed predictions of the total cross - section differences @xmath7 and @xmath8 for @xmath46-@xmath47 scattering were presented in an earlier paper @xcite .",
    "these calculations were based on three separate analyses of @xmath9-@xmath2he scattering and reaction data @xcite , as well as a microscopic resonating - group model calculation of the 4n excited states @xcite .",
    "it was observed that , although the different sets of phase shifts provide adequate descriptions of pre - existing data , they predict quantitatively different values of both @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the present region of interest . in most instances these discrepancies could be attributed to one or two partial waves .",
    "based on this observation , we concluded that comprehensive measurements of both @xmath7 and @xmath8 , in combination with the unpolarized neutron total cross section @xmath34 , could be used to extract specific information about the partial - wave content of the resonating @xmath12he compound nucleus .",

    "values for these corrections ( @xmath63  mk and @xmath64  mk ) were determined by fitting the observed low - temperature properties of bcc solid @xmath2he @xcite .    for the measurements reported in this paper ,",
    "a @xmath2he-@xmath12he dilution refrigerator was used to cool the sample to approximately 12  mk in an externally - applied magnetic field of 7  t. the field was provided by a superconducting split - coil magnet operated in persistent - current mode .",

    "the powder was used to provide good thermal contact between the solid @xmath2he and the becu cell , ensuring a homogeneous temperature throughout the target .",
    "the solid @xmath2he sample was grown by first filling the cell with liquid @xmath2he at approximately 3  k. the liquid was then compressed to a density of 0.125  g / cm@xmath2 by increasing the @xmath2he vapor pressure to 3.6  mpa . at this density solid began to form at 1.1  k , and the sample was completely solidified at 0.83  k @xcite . with the silver powder in place ,",
    "the thickness of the solid @xmath2he sample was @xmath69  atoms / cm@xmath5 .",
    "the target polarization was extracted from the temperature of the becu sample cell , as measured by two independent thermometric standards : a @xmath71co nuclear orientation thermometer @xcite and a @xmath2he melting curve thermometer ( mct ) @xcite .",
    "the nuclear orientation thermometry required an intrinsic germanium detector to observe the 1.17  mev and 1.33  mev @xmath72  rays from @xmath71co . to avoid radiation damage from neutrons however ,",
    "the detector had to be removed from the experimental hall whenever beam was on target . therefore the @xmath71co measurements were made immediately before and after each neutron asymmetry measurement .",
    "the melting curve thermometer on the other hand , could be used throughout the neutron measurements .",
    "the output of the mct was read directly into the data acquisition computer and the temperature sampled every 100  ms .",
    "the average polarization of the target for a particular asymmetry measurement was determined from the average mct temperature during that time . with no beam on target the @xmath71co and mct",

    "the @xmath2h(@xmath3,@xmath4)@xmath2he reaction was used to produce neutrons with energy less than 4  mev because it has a negative q - value , -0.764  mev . however , safety considerations limited the maximum amount of tritium that could be used , and the resulting neutron fluxes were low .",
    "the @xmath5h(@xmath6,@xmath4)@xmath2he reaction ( q=3.269  mev ) was used at higher energies , and the neutron fluxes here were typically 1020 times greater .",
    "the polarized charged - particle beams were produced by the tunl atomic beam polarized ion source @xcite and accelerated by a tandem van de graaff .",
    "the ion source produced a polarized beam whose spin axis was parallel to its momentum . a wien filter located between the source and accelerator",
    "was used to rotate the polarized beam s spin axis to the desired orientation , longitudinal or transverse , at the neutron production target .",
    "the position of the beam was feedback - stabilized in both the horizontal and vertical planes by four sets of steering magnets .",

    "the havar window for this cell was 6.35  @xmath74 m thick , and the deuteron beam was stopped by a 0.51  mm tantalum disk .",
    "both neutron - production targets were air cooled . to eliminate the deflection of the charged particles due to the superconducting magnet , the last 1.2  m of beam pipe was constructed of soft iron and lined with a high permeability iron - nickel alloy .",

    "neutrons that were transmitted through the polarized target were detected by two liquid scintillators located at @xmath73 and surrounded by a polyethylene shield .",
    "the scintillation liquid ( bc501 ) was contained in two cylindrical aluminum containers ( 127  mm diameter , 127  mm long ) , each with an optically transparent endcap coupled to a 127  mm diameter photomultiplier tube .",
    "the cylinders were placed one atop the other , with their axes , as well the photomultiplier tubes , pointing in the vertical direction .",
    "pulse - shape discrimination ( psd ) was performed on the phototube anode signals to distinguish neutron events from @xmath72 rays .",
    "the psd was performed by commercially - manufactured modules @xcite , with pulse - height thresholds set to discriminate against low - energy neutrons .",
    "valid neutron events were counted in scalers , and stored in the computer at set intervals .",
    "the collimation / detection system was tested in two ways .",
    "first , the alignment of the target and collimator was verified by exposing x - ray films to the gammas produced by the charged - particle beam .",
    "this showed that the target completely filled the acceptance angle of the collimator .",
    "second , neutron time - of - flight measurements were performed with a pulsed beam at 10 mev .",
    "the time - of - flight spectrum showed that only neutrons of the correct energy were being counted .",
    "in addition , blocking the exit of the collimator with 30  cm of tungsten followed by 30  cm of polyethylene reduced the neutron count rate by a factor of @xmath77 , indicating that the detectors were adequately shielded from energetic background neutrons .",
    "the neutron transmission asymmetries were observed by reversing the spin of the charged - particle beam every 100 ms . for an accurate measurement",
    "it is necessary to know the ratio of the neutron fluxes produced by each spin state of the charged - particle beam . for the @xmath2h(@xmath3,@xmath4)@xmath2he reaction ,",
    "the neutron yield is proportional to the proton beam current , and it proved sufficient to count the digitized beam current in each spin state , using the ratio to normalize the neutron fluxes .",
    "such normalization does not work for the @xmath5h(@xmath6,@xmath4)@xmath2he reaction because here the yield depends on the tensor polarization @xmath78 of the deuteron beam as well as on the beam intensity .",
    "the polarized source was operated in a manner such that , ideally , @xmath78 remained constant while the vector polarization was completely reversed . in practice",

    "this monitor detector was used to normalize the number of neutrons in the _ up _ and _ down _ spin states to the same incident flux .",
    "because of its close proximity to the superconducting magnet , the monitor detector was optically coupled to a 51  mm diameter phototube by a 1  m long light pipe . due to its small dimensions ( @xmath79  mm ) , @xmath72 rays did not deposit much energy in this detector and could be separated from the neutron events by pulse height alone , without the need for pulse - shape discrimination .",

    "[ sec : background ] .",
    "the polarization of the charged - particle beam was measured with a carbon - foil polarimeter .",
    "the polarization of the neutron beam was then calculated from the polarization of the charged particles , using known polarization - transfer coefficients .",

    "acquisition into the spin - up spectra was inhibited during the spin - down portions of each eight - step sequence and vice versa .",
    "all data acquisition was inhibited 2  ms prior to and 5  ms after each spin flip to give the beam polarization time to stabilize .",
    "acquisition was also halted whenever the beam current fell above or below prescribed limits . to ensure that equal time was spent in both the up- and down - spin states , the entire eight - step sequence during which the beam current had fallen outside its limits was rejected in the final data analysis .",

    "the polarization of the liquid phase at 1  k was less than 0.5% , while its density was 8% less than the density of the solid .",
    "these measurements were performed to determine how much of the observed neutron transmission asymmetry was due to effects other than spin - dependent forces between the polarized neutron beam and polarized target nuclei .    while these background , or `` warm '' , asymmetries were typically an order of magnitude lower than the spin - spin asymmetries , they were , in general , non - zero and were subtracted from the spin - spin , or `` cold '' measurements . as discussed below",
    ", the asymmetries observed during the warm measurements were due to polarization effects associated with the incident charged - particle beams .",

    "the warm measurement at 3.65  mev was in fact consistent with zero .",
    "thus @xmath7 ( at this energy ) was determined from the cold asymmetry measurements alone , @xmath113    in the case of the @xmath5h(@xmath6,@xmath4)@xmath2he reaction we must consider two sources of background asymmetry .",
    "in addition to a vector analyzing power ( which produces an asymmetry in the neutron yield at non - zero angles ) , this reaction possesses a tensor analyzing power that affects the neutron yield at @xmath73 .",

    "this led to an asymmetry in the monitor - normalized neutron counts caused by either the vector or tensor analyzing power , or both .",
    "a vector analyzing power is parity - forbidden for a longitudinally - polarized deuteron beam , and during the transverse measurements we observed little change in the deuteron vector polarization .",
    "therefore the only correction necessary for the @xmath5h(@xmath6,@xmath4)@xmath2he measurements was one based on the _ tensor _ analyzing power . since both the background asymmetry and the asymmetry observed by the monitor detector were proportional to @xmath119 , it proved convenient to use the monitor asymmetry ( which was measured with a high degree of statistical accuracy ) to scale the warm to cold asymmetry measurements . thus , for the @xmath5h(@xmath6,@xmath4)@xmath2he measurements , @xmath120 ,                                                          \\label{deltasigl2}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) are the cold ( warm ) monitor asymmetries .    according to eqs .",
    "[ yieldt ] and [ yieldl ] , the asymmetry resulting from a given value of @xmath119 should be twice as large and of the opposite sign in the longitudinal geometry as in the transverse .",

    "transmission asymmetries for the longitudinal geometry were measured at neutron energies 3.65 , 4.95 , and 7.46 mev .",

    "briefly , the phase shifts result from two published sets of partial - wave analyses ( pwa ) of @xmath9-@xmath2he scattering data @xcite , a charge - independent @xmath10-matrix analysis of virtually all @xmath11 scattering and reaction data below excitation energies of 30 mev @xcite , and the preliminary results of a microscopic , variational calculation of the @xmath12he continuum @xcite .",
    "the latter is a multi - channel resonating group model ( mcrgm ) calculation that uses a gaussian - parameterized version of the bonn meson - exchange potential @xcite as its input .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath8 calculations have been presented and discussed in greater detail in an earlier paper @xcite .",
    "three sets of phase shifts adequately reproduce @xmath34 , only the mcrgm values are clearly too low .",
    "the mcrgm phases also produce values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 that are significantly lower than experiment .",
    "all three cases can be attributed to insufficient @xmath129-wave amplitudes , especially the @xmath130 partial wave . between neutron energies of 2 and 5 mev ,",
    "the @xmath130 wave is the dominant partial wave in all four sets of phase shifts , although there is considerable discrepancy as to its strength .",
    "the @xmath130 wave of both the mcrgm and the lisowski pwa are nearly identical to one another , but they are considerably smaller than those of the @xmath10-matrix or jany pwa analyses",
    ". consequently these two sets of phase shifts predict the lowest values of both @xmath7 and @xmath8 . to correctly reproduce @xmath34 ,",
    "the lisowski pwa compensates for its relatively small @xmath130 wave with unusually large @xmath131 waves , particularly @xmath132 . since spin - singlet states can only be formed when the beam and target spins are antiparallel to one another , lisowski _",
    "et al.s_ large @xmath132 amplitude further lessen their predictions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , the jany pwa possesses the largest @xmath130 wave , ascribing over 60% of the total ( unpolarized ) cross section at 2  mev to this particular wave .",
    "likewise the jany pwa predicts @xmath7 and @xmath8 values that are slightly higher than experiment .",
    "the @xmath10-matrix phase shifts reproduce @xmath8 at all four energies .",
    "the @xmath10-matrix prediction of @xmath7 comes closest to the measured values , although it is higher than experiment at 3.65  mev .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : s0results ] that the @xmath10-matrix also overpredicts the unpolarized total cross section @xmath34 by nearly 200  mb at this energy .",
    "one possible explanation is the @xmath133 partial wave which , in the @xmath10-matrix analysis , is much larger at 3.65  mev than in the other three analyses .",
    "while @xmath8 is completely insensitive to this partial wave , @xmath7 is extremely so .",
    "if the @xmath10-matrix 200  mb overprediction of @xmath34 is completely attributed to the @xmath133 partial wave , it should likewise overpredict @xmath7 by 400  mb ( see eq .",
    "[ dsigl ] ) .",
    "the experimental result of @xmath7 at 3.65  mev is consistent with this conclusion .",
    "the primary sources of the @xmath133 partial wave are a pair of @xmath134 resonances at 23.6  mev ( @xmath135 ) and 24.2  mev ( @xmath136 ) . according to the @xmath10-matrix analysis , both of these excited states are predominately spin - triplet in the nucleon - trinucleon channels . the @xmath7 result at 3.65  mev , in conjunction with the unpolarized neutron total cross section at that energy , may indicate that the resonance parameters associated with one or both of the @xmath134 levels are in need of slight adjustment .",
    "we have reported measurements of the polarized neutron  polarized @xmath2he total cross section . a cryogenically - polarized target consisting of nearly 1/2 mole of solid",
    "@xmath2he has been developed for these measurements .",
    "it is the largest sample of polarized @xmath2he yet utilized in a nuclear physics experiment .",
    "it is particularly well suited for neutral beams such as neutrons or ( real ) photons , where the sources of beam - related heating are minimal .",
    "measurements of the longitudinal and transverse total cross - section differences @xmath7 and @xmath8 were performed for incident neutron energies 28  mev .",
    "the results are reproduced by phase shifts obtained in a recent @xmath10-matrix analysis of @xmath11 scattering and reaction data . as such",
    "they provide additional support to the @xmath12he level scheme resulting from that analysis .",
    "however , the measurement of @xmath7 at 3.65  mev , in conjunction with the unpolarized neutron total cross section at that energy , may indicate that a modification of the @xmath10-matrix @xmath133 partial wave is necessary .",
    "none of the other three sets of phase shifts considered here are able to reproduce both the present data and previous measurements of the unpolarized neutron total cross section . in all instances we are able to trace the discrepancies to only one or two partial waves .",
    "in particular , we find clear evidence that the @xmath132 phase shift reported by lisowski _",
    "is too large .    in the future we plan to extend the present measurements to lower energies where",
