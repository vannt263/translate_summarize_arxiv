    "research in dilute atomic quantum gases remains one of the most vibrant areas in physics almost ten years after the landmark discovery of atomic bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "increasingly , new experiments are revealing the rich possibilities afforded by the internal electronic state structures of an atom , e.g. , the generation of atom entanglement in the mott phase through controlled collisions from the relative displacement of the optical lattice potentials of the respective atomic internal states @xcite and the recent observation of condensation of fermionic atom pairs @xcite",
    ".    it has been known for a long time that the spinor degrees of freedom of an atom becomes accessible if a far - off - resonant optical trap is used to provide equal confinement for all zeeman states , instead of the more widely used magnetic traps for spin polarized atoms @xcite .",
    "several earlier experiments have produced fascinating observations of spinor condensates , a superfluid with internal degrees of freedom , e.g. , with @xmath3na atoms in @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6rb atoms in @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite , spin domains and interdomain tunnelling @xcite , as well as the generation of coreless vortex states @xcite .",
    "these properties exist only because of the spinor nature of the condensate order parameter , and thus are generally not expected to occur in a magnetically trapped condensate .    despite these and other related successes with spinor condensates ,",
    "our knowledge remains limited regarding the condensation thermodynamics of spin-1 atoms . in a sense ,",
    "the spin-1 condensate constitutes a type of quantum fluid unfamiliar to many of us . on the experimental side",
    ", it remains a significant challenge to produce a spinor condensate , as evidenced by the disproportionally small numbers of spinor bec experiments in operation . in this article",
    ", we reconsider the topic of the condensation thermodynamics for a system of trapped spin-1 atoms . of particular interest to us",

    "first investigated the thermodynamics of the bec phase transition for a spin-1 gas @xcite .",
    "studied analytically the effect of a magnetic field on the transition temperature @xcite . while an attempt to find the zero - magnetic - field phase diagram was made through numerical simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite , there still exist several question marks to the overall picture of bec for a spin-1 bose gas , especially for ferromagnetically interacting atoms such as @xmath6rb . limited by the computation procedure within the bogoliubov - popov approximation , only a few data points were made available in the earlier studies by isoshima _",
    "the lack of focused experimental efforts also indirectly discouraged a detailed investigation of this problem until now .    in this paper",
    "we systematically investigate the phase diagram of a spin-1 bose gas for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions . instead of the bogoliubov approach , we will adopt the hartree - fock - popov approximation and employ a semiclassical approximation to the noncondensed atoms within the mean field theory .",
    "we will also enforce the thermodynamics for a finite trapped system with a fixed total atom number @xmath1 and a total magnetization @xmath2 .",
    "recent studies have significantly verified the accuracy of this approximation when applied to similar systems @xcite . as we will illustrate in this work",
    "our results indicate that double condensations will occur for a spin-1 gas with antiferromagnetic interactions , while triple condensations are more likely for ferromagnetic interactions .",

    "the inset shows the details of a zoomed - in plot near the minimum.,width=312 ]    figure [ rbe ] shows the lowest excitation energy @xmath138 for the three components of a @xmath6rb gas at @xmath139 , @xmath140 ( right before the condensation of the @xmath35 component ) .",
    "we see that the energy for the @xmath35 component is lower than the corresponding ones for the other two states and takes a minimum near the spatial location of @xmath141 @xmath27 m , which is at the edge of the condensed @xmath29 component .",
    "this result confirms that the @xmath35 component condenses before the @xmath34 component and surrounds the condensed @xmath29 component .",
    "we have studied the thermodynamics of bose - einstein condensation for a gas of spin-1 atoms with ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions using the mean field hartree - fock - popov theory and the semiclassical approximation for the noncondensed components .",
    "our results show that for antiferromagnetic interactions , double phase transitions persist as in a noninteracting gas : when @xmath104 , first the @xmath29 component condenses , which is followed by the condensation of the @xmath35 component on further decreasing of the temperature .",
    "the @xmath34 component never condenses . for ferromagnetic interactions , on the other hand ,",
    "our calculations reveal that the phase diagram becomes more complicated and a triple condensation scenario arises with decreasing temperatures : first the @xmath29 component condenses , which is followed by the second condensation of the @xmath35 component , and the third one for the @xmath34 component . when the @xmath29 and @xmath35 components are the only condensed ones , they are immiscible . when all three components condense and the temperature is lower than @xmath123 , they become miscible because of the presence of a large condensed @xmath34 component . we have compared the numerically computed transition temperatures with that of an ideal gas as in fig .",
    "an overall lowering of the various transition temperatures due to atom - atom interactions is seen , consistent with the case of a single component interacting bose gas , where the interaction - caused shift to the transition temperature has been actively studied @xcite .",
    "quite generally a repulsive interaction tends to lower the transition temperature for a single component bose gas @xcite . in the case of a spin-1 bose gas considered here , @xmath142 and @xmath143 constitutes an overall repulsive interaction .    finally , we note there also exists the possibility of a ferromagnetic phase transition for @xmath6rb atoms , in addition to the bose - einstein condensation as studied here .",
    "in fact , as was investigated recently by gu and klemm @xcite , the ferromagnetic transition is generally predicted to occur before , i.e. at temperatures higher than , the bose einstein condensation .",
    "the present study , however , remains unchanged because we treated the system within the global constraint of the conservation of total magnetization , distinct from that required for a separate ferromagnetic phase transition @xcite .",
    "as is evidenced from recent experiments , the total magnetization @xmath2 is well conserved , even better than the conservation of the total number @xmath1 @xcite .",
