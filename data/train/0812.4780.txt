    "one of the most surprising puzzles to emerge from the _ swift _ ( gehrels et  al . 2004 ) mission and its dynamic study of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is the lack of expected jet breaks in x - ray afterglow emission . it is vital to the entire study of grbs to understand jet geometry , because of the inferred effects on the total output energy , grb rate , afterglow structure , interactions with environment , and jet physical mechanisms .",
    "optical observations showed tens of cases of steepening in the light curves several days after the grb triggers ( frail et  al .",
    "2001 ; bloom , frail , & sari 2001 ; zeh , klose , & kann 2006 ) .",
    "this steepening was interpreted as evidence for the collimation of the burst ejecta with physical half - angle @xmath4 .",
    "the ejecta moves at relativistic velocities with a bulk lorentz factor , @xmath5 , and the radiation is relativistically beamed into an angle @xmath6 . as the ejecta sweeps up surrounding material , the fireball decelerates , with the beaming angle eventually exceeding the physical collimation angle , causing a sudden increase in the rate of decay of the flux ( i.e. the jet break ) . at the same time",
    ", sideways expansion of the ejecta with relativistic speeds also causes a sudden flux decrease ( sari , piran , & halpern 1999 ; rhoads 1999 ; zhang & mszros 2004 ) .",
    "most likely both of these effects contribute to the jet breaks , and therefore , both models must be considered .",
    "breaks are expected to be achromatic based on the assumption that the afterglow emission regions and mechanisms are the same for various spectral regimes , and should therefore only reflect ejecta geometry .",
    "achromaticity has indeed been confirmed in the optical / near - infrared bands in pre-_swift _ grbs ( kulkarni et  al . 1999 ; harrison et  al . 2001 ; klose et  al .",
    "2004 ) .    in the _ swift _ era , it is x - ray afterglow light curves that provide the most homogeneous data set to study grb afterglows . with the rapid grb triggers provided by the _ swift _",
    "-bat , and the autonomous prompt _ swift _ -xrt observations that frequently begin within 1 - 2 minutes of the trigger , x - ray afterglows have gone from sparsely sampled single power - laws ( beppo - sax era , 2006 ) to a rich database of light curves with widely varying properties and durations . a common canonical shape of the _",
    "swift _ -xrt x - ray light curves emerged ( ( 2006 ) ; zhang et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) , figure [ fig : canon ] ) with five components ( an initial steep decay , a shallow - decay `` plateau '' phase , a normal decay , a jet - like decay component , and flares ) that could be used to explain the overall structure of the afterglows .",
    "while elements of this canonical picture are seen in most x - ray afterglows , few afterglows contain all 5 components .",
    "surprisingly , fully `` canonical '' jet breaks are rarely observed in the xrt light curves ( burrows & racusin 2007 ; liang et  al .",
    "2008 ; evans et  al .",
    "2008 ) .    in this work",
    ", we assume that all x - ray afterglows have inherently similar shapes ( the canonical shape ) with deviations in behavior due to environment , electron spectral shape , spectral regime , presence of energy injection , and jet properties .",
    "we also explore observational biases such as late beginning and early ending of observation , flares , and observing gaps that lead to missing portions of individual light curves which can produce ambiguities in the identification of segments .",
    "we assume that the light curve segments following the initial steep decay ( figure [ fig : canon ] , segments ii - iv ) are due to external forward shocks .",
    "although we recognise that several alternative models have recently been proposed to explain the origin of the x - ray afterglows ( e.g. , daigne , & mochkovitch ( 2007 ) ; shao & dai ( 2007 ) ; ghisellini et  al .",
    "( 2007a ) ; liang , zhang , & zhang ( 2007 ) ; uhm & beloborodov ( 2007 ) ; liang et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) ; panaitescu ( 2008 ) ; kumar , narayan , & johnson ( 2008 ) ) , as discussed below ( see also 2007 , 2008 ) , the x - ray data can be generally interpreted within the framework of the forward shock , so that invoking non - forward - shock models is not absolutely demanded by the data .",
    "we also focus solely on the x - ray behavior of the afterglow light curves , while acknowledging that chromatic behavior inferred from optical observations provides important clues into jet properties ( liang et  al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "based on the optical afterglow observations in the pre-_swift _ era ( frail et  al .",
    "2001 ; bloom , frail , & kulkarni 2003 ) , we expected to find jet breaks occurring within several days after the bursts , with the light curves breaking to decay slopes of @xmath7 ( sari et  al .",
    "several recent studies ( burrows & racusin 2007 ; liang et  al .",

    "2008 ) have searched for jet breaks in the xrt data and agree that there is a substantial deficit relative to pre-_swift _ expectations .",
    "( 2007 ) suggests additional potential jet breaks in the sample , but is very broad in his jet break definition , attributing even breaks with shallower decays occurring after plateaus to jet breaks without discussion of the more global context of the light curves .",
    "this method does not follow the framework of the canonical picture observed in many afterglows , though it suggests that some jet breaks are buried in the existing measured breaks , which we explore in more detail .",
    "previous studies of large afterglow samples have applied only the simplest afterglow models , rather than the detailed interpretations needed to explain grbs in individual cases .",
    "for example , the end of the plateau phase is often attributed to a cessation of energy injection without considering the possibility that it might represent a jet break during energy injection ( see also 2008 ) .",
    "other model variations including a flat electron spectrum , different progenitor environments , and jet geometry and dynamics would slightly alter the properties of the canonical behavior .",
    "therefore , in this study we perform a more generalized characterization of all xrt afterglows , reexamining a wide variety of closure relations to evaluate which segments of each light curve are consistent with each family of closure relations , whether there are any jet breaks that have been previously misinterpreted , and what limits can be placed on jet break statistics and energetics .",
    "there are multiple reasons that we may not be detecting jet breaks in xrt data .",
    "we ask the following questions to explore this problem : are jet breaks subtle and buried within our observing errors ( see also , van der horst , & wijers 2008 ) ? do the jet breaks occur after the xrt observations end ? do observational biases that cause us to miss parts of the light curves result in ambiguous classifications ?",
    "could some of the breaks at the end of the plateau phases actually be jet breaks that are masked by continuing energy injection ?",
    "are those grbs for which jet breaks are not detected somehow intrinsically or observationally different than those for which they are detected ?",
    "the goal of this study is to attempt to answer these questions .",
    "we describe the data sample selection , temporal analysis , and spectral analysis in  [ sec : data ] , the closure relations in  [ sec : cr ] , the results in  [ sec : results ] , discussion and implications in  [ sec : disc ] , and conclude in  [ sec : conc ] . throughout this paper",

    "where necessary , corrections for photon pile - up were also made by excluding a central portion of the extraction region .",

    "based upon visual inspection , the user first eliminates all obvious time intervals with significant flaring .",

    "over - estimating them , we tested both @xmath30 confidence interval mapping and monte carlo simulation methods . in the monte carlo method we created 10000 simulated light curves for each grb light curve jiggling the data points by an amount drawn randomly from the poisson distributions derived from the source and background counts .",
    "each of these light curves was fit with the same method as the real light curves .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath32 confidence intervals were taken from the distributions of each fit parameter from the simulations .",
    "the broken power - law fits were not well behaved in @xmath33 contour space due to data binning , light curve gaps , and logarithmic fits , resulting in larger error estimates compared to the monte carlo method .",
    "the latter method is more free from assumptions and biases , therefore we chose to use the monte carlo light curve parameter error estimates for the following analysis .",
    "we classify each segment of the light curves in terms of the canonical form ( figure [ fig : canon ] ) using the the following criteria .",
    "if the light curve is a triple broken power - law then identification of its segments is unambiguous , and it is designated as a type i - ii - iii - iv .",
    "if the light curve is best fit by a double broken power - law , we apply the criteria that if @xmath34 then it is designated as segments i - ii - iii or if @xmath35 then it is designated as segments ii - iii - iv .",
    "if the light curve is best fit by a singly broken power - law , we apply the criteria that if @xmath34 then it is designated as segments i - ii , while if @xmath35 then it can be interpreted as either segments ii - iii or iii - iv .",

    "the single power - law distribution also differs from segments i , ii , and iv at @xmath36 level .",
    "however , the single power - law and segment iii distributions are more similar ( @xmath37 probability of begin drawn from same inherent distribution ) , suggesting that some of the single power - laws are segments iii , with others drawn from segments i , ii , and iv .",
    "this scheme has no implicit constraints on the range of temporal indices , but does leave some ambiguity in the case of a broken power - law with @xmath35 .",
    "this case is equivocal between segments ii - iii and iii - iv .",
    "we generally assume that they are cases of ii - iii when looking at sample distributions .",

    "the fireball model predicts the evolution of the spectral and temporal properties of grb afterglows as the external shocks decelerate in the external environment . these effects can be characterized by relationships between the temporal and spectral indices ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "these so - called `` closure relations '' of the fireball model depend on the physical processes in the relevant portion of the afterglow light curve , the surrounding environment , electron spectral index , cooling regime , and jet geometry ( & mszros , 1994 ; mszros & rees , 1997 ; sari , piran , & narayan , 1998 ; chevalier & li , 2000 ; dai & cheng , 2001 , see reviews by , 2002 ; zhang & mszros , 2004 ; piran , 2005 ) .",
    "we apply a large set of possible models to each segment of the light curves and use them in conjunction to narrow the list of possible physical models to explain each afterglow segment , assuming that synchrotron radiation is the dominant mechanism and including only the corresponding relevant relations .",
    "we also use them to determine the presence and properties of jet breaks in our sample of x - ray light curves .",
    "all of the analytical closure relations assume a simple spectrum with sharp breaks , whereas in reality these breaks are likely smooth ( granot & sari 2002 ) .",
    "however , unfortunately even with broadband seds for each light curve segment , the smoothness of these spectral breaks is impossible to measure except in perhaps a few special cases . in order to learn about the global properties of x - ray afterglows in a statistical sample ,",
    "we make simplifying assumptions including neglecting the smoothness of these breaks .",
    "we present an extensive set of closure relations ( table [ table : crs ] ) including those for constant density interstellar medium ( ism , @xmath42 constant ) and wind ( @xmath43 ) environments , electron spectral index cases of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and slow cooling and fast cooling regimes ( sari et  al .",
    "1998 ) . for each case",
    ", we present closure relations both with and without energy injection .",
    "these various theoretical permutations have been invoked to explain the likely physical scenarios in the general scheme and in many individual observational cases , but have never been combined on such a large sample of afterglow light curves .",
    "the constant density ism environment , the simplest plausible model , is often well fit by observations . however , the wind environment is closer to what one would expect for the medium surrounding high - mass stars near the end of their lives ( i.e. wolf - rayet stars ) .",
    "this dilemma has led to theoretical speculation of how massive star environments might appear observationally to have a constant density .",
    "( 2006 ) conducted numerical simulations of stellar wind environments where the wind exists only in a region very close to the star , and showed that the right combination of wind pressure , ism density , progenitor rotation , and metallicity , can make a wind environment appear like an ism environment when probed by the grb forward shock .",
    "however , it is difficult to constrain these conditions observationally .",
    "( 2007 ) compares the environments and interactions of sne ib / c to the expectations for the grb case , finding the main difference to be in the progenitor metallicity , ism pressure , and possibly rotation .",
    "he also finds that grb environments could produce a close termination shock outside of which the medium would be constant density .",
    "both the ism and wind environments are surely simplistic descriptions of actual grb environments , especially when considering that local examples of wolf - rayet stars like eta carinae show massive irregular winds that can be modeled by neither a constant density nor a @xmath46 environment . in this study , it is only feasible to test the simplest models , therefore we choose to include both ism and wind closure relation alternatives and determine directly which model best approximates each afterglow .    the electron spectral index , @xmath47 , is typically expected to be larger than 2 to avoid a divergent total integrated energy for harder distributions unless a high - energy cutoff is invoked .",
    "numerical modelling of electron acceleration ( achterberg et  al . 2001 ; eichler & waxman 2005 ) is also consistent with @xmath45 .",
    "however , a @xmath48 flat electron spectrum has been adapted to explain specific observations of shallow temporal decays ( panaitescu & kumar 2001 ; bhattacharya 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , we choose to include all plausible alternatives .",
    "when evaluating the closure relations for @xmath44 , we adopt the treatment described by & cheng ( 2001 ) .",
    "we evaluate sets of closure relations whose form is @xmath49 by defining a new parameter , @xmath50 , such that : @xmath51 using the measured values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , we compare the output ( @xmath50 ) to the expectation of zero .",

    "the steep decline of segment i in the canonical x - ray light curve is probably due to the tail end of the prompt emission and is governed by the curvature effect , for which emission from different viewing angles reaches the observer with different delays due to light propagation effects ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ; zhang et  al . 2006 ) .",
    "the relationship between the temporal and spectral slopes of the high latitude emission is @xmath65 or in our formulation @xmath66 and is independent of any of the environmental or other parameters that affect the closure relations for the external shock .",
    "therefore , we only use this relation to help discriminate segment i from other segments and we do not use this relation to constrain any of the burst properties explored throughout the rest of this paper . we find that @xmath67 of the segments i in our sample are consistent with this relation , with the remainder either steeper ( @xmath68 ) or shallower ( @xmath69 ) than this relation .",

    "the models in table [ table : crs ] can be used in succession throughout an individual x - ray afterglow light curve , however several models often fit equally well for any given light curve segment . after fitting each closure relation to each set of @xmath9 and @xmath10 ,",
    "we combine them to form a coherent physical model for each afterglow .",
    "while we often can not distinguish a unique set of closure relations , we can use information from one segment to exclude inconsistent relations from other segments .",
    "we assume there is no perceptible change in the circum - grb environment probed throughout an individual afterglow , and therefore if either an ism or wind environment can be excluded in any segment , we exclude it for the other segments .",
    "we do not allow transitions from slow cooling to fast cooling within any light curve .",
    "since we do not see evidence of a change of spectral index between segments in most individual afterglows , we require the spectral regime to remain constant throughout a light curve ( i.e. either @xmath79 or @xmath80 for slow cooling , or @xmath81 or @xmath82 for fast cooling ) , therefore excluding light curve breaks due to transitions of the cooling frequency through the x - ray band .",
    "theoretically , we do not expect the electron spectral index , @xmath47 , to change during an afterglow light curve .",
    "however , because we do not include the full suite of @xmath44 relations with energy injection , we are careful not to exclude a @xmath44 model just because only @xmath45 models are available to fit other segments .",
    "we eliminate models only on the the basis of their @xmath47 values being inconsistent between segments , which is especially important for those segments with @xmath83 and large error bars .",
    "we require a segment consistent with a particular isotropic model to also be consistent with a corresponding jet model in the following segment , and conversely a jet model must be consistent with a corresponding previous isotropic model in terms of environment and spectral frequency regime . similarly , any energy injection model in segment ii must be consistent with the models for the following segment ( if present ) in terms of environment and frequency regime .",
    "when a post - jet break relation with energy injection is applied , we require @xmath56 to be consistent between pre- and post - jet break segments .",
    "we also only allow jet breaks to directly precede potential segments iii or iv .",
    "ambiguous single power - laws have no restrictions on available sets of closure relations .    using these criteria , we eliminate some models to better constrain a coherent picture for each afterglow .",
    "unfortunately a unique set of models is often still unattainable , as several equally likely relations remain .",
    "in an attempt to extract any available information from the remaining closure relations , we look at constraints from families of closure relations to determine specific properties .",
    "for example , if several closure relations are consistent with a particular segment or whole afterglow but they are all ism relations , then we can conclude that this afterglow is consistent with the expectations of an ism environment .",
    "this also works for families of relations with a common spectral frequency regime , environment , and pre / post - jet break regime .",
    "our sample is broken up into four groups ( as described in  [ sec : lcfit ] ) based on their temporal properties .",
    "these groups include the i - ii - iii - iv / ii - iii - iv sample which have distinct segments iv , segments i - ii - iii , ambiguous segments ii - iii / iii - iv , and single power - laws .",
    "the latter three samples may contain jet breaks and still fit within the canonical light curve picture .",
    "the presence of observing biases can explain the missing contextual clues that would make jet break distinctions more clear . in order to avoid imposing biases on the results ,",
    "we have not attempted to distinguish jet breaks based on _ a priori _ assumptions for decay indices or break times .",
    "the fact that segments ii - iii / iii - iv light curves do not look like the canonical light curve is likely a result of two different observing biases : a late start or early end . the behavior prior to segment ii was either not observed at all due to a late observation start , or was complicated by flaring behavior making the underlying afterglow shape unclear , both leading to an unknown initial steep decline .",
    "if the observations began even later , segment i and ii would be missed , leaving only segments iii - iv .",
    "similarly , an early observation end would also lead to the observer missing the jet break .",
    "this end could be due to either a manual end of the observations because of observing contraints , or the afterglow becoming too faint for xrt detection .",
    "these two - segment ambiguous light curves may contain jet breaks as either the observed break , or with the inclusion of energy injection , the jet break would have occurred sometime prior to the start of the first segment . in this latter case ,",
    "the actual jet break time is impossible to determine because either there were no observation prior to the start of the apparent segment ii . considering the wide range of decay indices , observing times , and redshifts , these limitations are likely to have influenced the data",
    ".    apparent segments i - ii - iii show some suggestions of deviation from the canonical form , which can also be explained by observing biases . in some cases ,",
    "the temporal decay of these segments iii is substantially steeper than typical segments iii , as if they transitioned directly from segment ii to segment iv .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the segment iii is simply missing or buried in the data due to a short duration , large error bars , or gaps in the light curve with segment iv appearing to follow directly after segment ii .",
    "( 2007 ) proposed an empirical form of the canonical light curve that is made up of two falling exponential plus power - law functions that can explain the structure of most x - ray afterglow light curves .",
    "they suggest that missing phases , like that seen in the apparent ii - iv transitions , are a result of one of the two components being particularly bright , weak , or short lived .",
    "other types of light curves exist in the sample for which we do not observe jet breaks , and would not expect them to be hidden or ambiguous .",
    "these include light curves showing only segments i - ii , where the later segments presumably occurred after observations ended .",
    "another type and possible jet break sample contaminant is the so - called `` naked bursts '' which show only the initial steep decline from the prompt emission without the subsequent segments ( ii - iv ) attributed to the afterglow .",
    "this is thought to occur because the surrounding medium is not dense enough to produce the external shocks that power grb afterglows ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) .",
    "these grbs can appear as either single power - law decays or broken power - laws where the prompt emission and high latitude emission masquerade as segment ii - iii light curves in the absence of comparison to the @xmath3-ray prompt emission .",
    "three examples of possible naked grbs that have been investigated extensively are the long grbs 050421 ( godet et  al .",
    "2006 ) and 050412 ( mineo et  al . 2007 ) , and the short hard burst grb 051210 ( la parola et  al . 2006 ) . to filter out these bursts we search for any light curves that appear to be segments ii - iii , have break times @xmath84 sec , and are consistent with the high latitude closure relation ( eq .",
    "[ eq : highlat ] ) ; these should not be considered candidates for jet breaks . using these criteria ,",
    "we identify grb 060801 as another possible naked burst in addition those identified in the literature that is also a short hard grb . there may be more naked bursts in the single power - law sample like that of grb 050412 , but we have no clean way of distinguishing them , therefore we leave them for later discrimination .",
    "it is possible that additional naked bursts are present in the 29 grbs excluded from the final sample due to their faintness and limited observations which made temporal and spectral analysis not possible .    in order to learn more about these ambiguous afterglows and",
    "distinguish jet breaks , we apply the closure relations .",
    "the following section describes how we use the closure relations and the temporal behavior to identify additional jet break candidates .",
    "using the above criteria and consistency checks , we define sub - samples of x - ray afterglows that potentially contain jet breaks .",
    "large errors on @xmath9 and @xmath10 sometimes make definitive determination of afterglow properties via closure relations unfeasible .",
    "the cases where many ( pre- and post - jet break ) closure relations are consistent are evaluated using additional criteria and classified into categories based on their likelihood of containing real jet breaks .",
    "these additional criteria are based upon their resemblance to those afterglows with clear canonical jet breaks .",
    "we distinguish between those afterglows which are consistent with _ only _ post - jet break closure relations , those that are _ only _ consistent with pre - jet break closure relations , and those that are consistent with both .",
    "we divide our sample of potential jet breaks into 4 categories .",
    "the categories are the prominent jet breaks , hidden jet breaks , possible jet breaks , and unlikely jet breaks .",
    "the details of their categorical definitions follow .",
    "we define the prominent jet break class as those light curves for which we can clearly distinguish a break between segments iii and iv , with segment iv being consistent with post - jet break closure relations , consistent with the canonical morphology ( figure [ fig : prom ] ) .",
    "this conservative classification criterion requires that the light curve is composed of either segments i - ii - iii - iv or ii - iii - iv , and the final segment is consistent with post - jet break closure relations .",
    "we find 30 such afterglows , 28 of which are consistent within @xmath32 of at least one post - jet break closure relation in their segment iv after internal consistency checks .",
    "in the two inconsistent cases ( grbs 061121 and 070508 ) , all models were eliminated in the process of internal consistency checks with the @xmath32 criteria .",
    "the unusually bright grb 061121 ( page et  al . 2007 ) was triggered by a precursor , causing the choice of @xmath85 to affect the slopes , which may account for some of the deviations from the models .",
    "( 2007 ) also suggest the presence of a comptonized component .",
    "therefore , these outlier cases may not be well represented by the canonical form , have breaks due to other mechanisms such as the cooling frequency moving through the x - ray band , or are not valid with the suite of closure relations used here , and are ignored in the following analysis .    based on the canonical light curve form",
    ", we assume that segment iv is post - jet break .",
    "therefore , the post - jet break closure relations are the only models allowed in segment iv . in contrast , many closure relations are allowed by the canonical form for segments ii and iii .",
    "figure [ fig : gold_example ] shows an example of a burst in the prominent jet break category with its light curve and the closure relations that are consistent with the data .",
    "all four segments of this burst can be adequately characterized by the closure relations : segment i is consistent with the high latitude relation ; segment ii requires @xmath45 and energy injection , but is consistent with either slow or fast cooling and either ism or wind environment ; segment iii is consistent with either isotropic or jet - with - energy - injection relations ; and segment iv is consistent with either a spreading or non - spreading jet with an ism or wind environment .",
    "the resulting fits imply that the jet break time can not be unambiguously established ; if the ii - iii break is due to the cessation of energy injection then the iii - iv break is a jet break , but it is also possible that the ii - iii break is the jet break and the iii - iv break is due to the end of energy injection ( see also 2008 for a similar analysis of this grb ) .",
    "we list the properties of the prominent jet break bursts in table [ table : prominent ] .",
    "the distributions of these properties will be discussed in  [ sec : properties ] .",
    "we wish to assess the deficit of jet breaks in the xrt afterglow sample , therefore we must make a reasonable estimate of the fraction of our sample with jet breaks , accounting for a variety of observing biases . due to various observing constraints and light curve profiles , not all burst observations began with an immediate slew nor were they all observed out to a time at which the jet break is expected to have occurred .",
    "therefore , to calculate an accurate jet break fraction , we reduce our sample to only those grbs for which the observations span a time frame where we would expect a jet break .",
    "previous studies of optical jet breaks ( frail et  al . 2001 ; bloom et  al .",
    "2003 ; zeh et  al .",
    "2006 ) showed them to occur several days after the grb trigger .",
    "instead of making _ a priori _ assumptions about achromaticity or assuming similar behavior , we determine the time frame during which we would expect a jet break by studying the prominent jet break sample .",
    "the prominent jet break sample consists of 28 x - ray afterglows with @xmath86 ranging from a few minutes for those light curves that start with a segment i to an hour for those that start during segment ii , and @xmath87 ranging between 2 days and 5 months ( excluding late - time _",
    "observations ) .",
    "the important measurement from the prominent sample is the jet break time ( @xmath88 ) which ranges between 0.02 and 26.2 days ( excluding earlier breaks that suggest post - jet - breaks - with - energy - injection ) . excluding the extremely late jet break case of grb 060729 , and the extremely early jet break case of grb070328 , the latest light curve break in the whole sample is @xmath89 days , with @xmath31 occurring within 10 days",
    "therefore , we define our `` complete '' sample ( those grbs for which observations sufficiently cover a time range where a jet break could have been measured ) , to begin before 0.1 days and end after 10 days . of the 230 grbs in our sample , 82 fit these completeness criteria .",
    "the distributions of observation start , stop , break , last detection , and the jet break lower limit ( described in  [ sec : disc ] ) are shown in figure [ fig : times ] .      the prominent jet break category constitutes only @xmath90 of the total sample .",
    "we examined the remaining light curves for evidence of `` hidden '' jet breaks , identified by their closure relations rather than the light curve morphology .",
    "our hidden jet break category includes those light curves with ambiguous final segments .",
    "we consider three ambiguous cases .",
    "as noted in ",
    "[ sec : lcfit ] , broken power - laws with @xmath91 can not be distinguished _ a priori _ between segments ii - iii and iii - iv .",
    "if the final segment is only consistent with post - jet break closure relations , then we designate it as a iii - iv case with a hidden jet break .",
    "the second ambiguous case involves three segment light curves initially classified as i - ii - iii in which the final segment is steeper than typical segments iii and consequently only consistent with post - jet break closure relations .",
    "therefore , this type appears more like a i - ii - iv or a jet - break - with - energy - injection .",
    "the third ambiguous case involves single power - law light curves which are only consistent with post - jet break closure relations even though the jet break itself is not observed .",
    "we find an additional 12 light curves that fit these criteria , of which 3 are from the two - segment ambiguous sample , 9 are segments iii from the i - ii - iii sample , and none are single power - laws .",
    "figure [ fig : silver_example ] shows an example that was classified as an ambiguous ii - iii / iii - iv until we found that its final segment is only consistent with post - jet break closure relations .",
    "we list the properties of the hidden jet breaks in table [ table : hidden ] .    our classification of xrf 060218 as a hidden jet break illustrates one limitation of our methodology .",
    "using the closure relations in table [ table : crs ] , we find a post - jet break decay to be the only possible outcome . in doing",
    "so we assume that the emission is due to a purely forward shock origin .",
    "individual studies on xrf / grb 060218 ( campana et  al .",
    "2006 ; ghisellini , ghirlanda , & tavecchio 2007b ) show a strong early thermal component related to the associated sn 2006aj and the observed shock break out , followed by a possible compton component .",
    "our analysis reveals an unusually steep late - time spectral slope , which may suggest that our models are not applicable in this individual case .",
    "therefore , this break may not be due to a jet break at all .",
    "we choose treat all grbs in our sample in the same way , and our methodology did not account for possible non - power law spectral components . as a result ,",
    "a small fraction of the sample coule be mis - classified .",
    "we note that only @xmath92 of grb afterglows show evidence for thermal spectral components .",
    "we now examine the remaining light curves to search for additional jet breaks in the data set that have not been previously identified as prominent or hidden . of the remaining 187 light curves , there are 43 that are consistent with only pre - jet break relations in their last segment , and therefore classified as non - jet breaks .",
    "the remaining 144 light curves are ambiguous because they are consistent with both pre- and post - jet break closure relations .",
    "this sample includes those ambiguous segments ii - iii / iii - iv , single power - laws , and segments i - ii - iii in which segment iii is potentially post - jet break .",
    "we use the properties of the prominent jet break sample to identify possible jet breaks in the ambiguous sample .",
    "the samples of ambiguous segments ii - iii / iii - iv , segments i - ii - iii , and the prominent sample have the common feature of apparent segments ii - iii with a break in between , which is a shared distinct component that can be used to compare them .",
    "we use the prominent jet break sample as a `` control group '' for comparisons with the other categories .",
    "figure [ fig : compare23 ] shows the distributions of temporal decay indices and break times for segments ii and iii for all three groups .",
    "the temporal indices split relatively cleanly into several distinct distributions , especially in the prominent sample .",
    "there is a small amount of overlap between segments iii and iv in the prominent jet break sample , but this is not surprising considering the multitude of possible model scenarios employed to explain these light curves .",
    "the distributions for the ambiguous segments ii - iii / iii - iv are plotted assuming that they are all segments ii - iii .",
    "the broader and steeper distributions in this sample are consistent with some contamination by actual segments iii - iv .",
    "the steeper than expected segments ii and iii from the sample of segments i - ii - iii are also consistent with the hypothesis of segment iii confusion and post - jet - break - with - energy - injection .",
    "the break times between segments ii and iii , as plotted in the right - hand side of figure [ fig : compare23 ] , are also suggestive of these findings .",
    "the distributions are not nearly as narrow as those suggested by the canonical light curve form ( nousek et  al . 2006",
    "; zhang et  al . 2006 ) , but do suggest a spread to larger break times in the contaminated ambiguous ii - iii / iii - iv sample and the segments i - ii - iii sample .",
    "the break times are also dispersed due to redshift effects whose amplitude is unknown for @xmath93 of the grbs . when looking only at those grbs with known redshifts , these same distributions are narrower and more cleanly separated .    to further distinguish those potential jet breaks that are in this contaminated ambiguous group , we look at the correlations between the temporal decay slopes from different segments in the same light curves . in the left side of figure [ fig : alpha_alpha ]",
    "we plot @xmath94 versus @xmath95 , @xmath96 versus @xmath94 , and @xmath96 versus @xmath95 for the prominent sample as our `` control group '' and see a reasonably clean distinction between the light curve transitions in this @xmath97 parameter space , which can be used to classify the remaining ambiguous segments .",
    "we use the `` control group '' to determine the area of @xmath97 space for each cluster of specific segment combinations . the mean values for each cluster from the control group",
    "are indicated by the black crosses . for each ambiguous light curve , we calculate the distance in @xmath97 space to each cluster mean weighted by @xmath98 , and categorize the ambiguous segment transitions based upon their proximity to these mean values ( right side , figure [ fig : alpha_alpha ] ) .",
    "these resulting new classifications lead to 21 bursts previously in the ambiguous segments ii - iii / iii - iv or segments i - ii - iii sample that are similar in @xmath97 space to the prominent jet break sample for the segments iii - iv transition , and 26 bursts that are similar to the segments ii - iv transition .",
    "their consistency with post - jet break closure relations and temporal slopes suggest that there are indications of jet breaks in those light curves .",
    "the remaining 53 ambiguous light curves from this sample s transitions appear to be segments ii - iii and therefore probably pre - jet break . however , they could possibly be segment ii with a post - jet - break - with - energy - injection segment iii .",
    "we are unable to distinguish these cases , therefore we put these remaining afterglows into a new category called unlikely jet breaks .",
    "( these light curves are called unlikely jet breaks because their slopes are too shallow compared to the prominent jet break @xmath9s to be post - jet break . )",
    "we show example light curves for each of these newly segregated groups in figures [ fig : possible_example23]-[fig : possible_example24 ] .",
    "finally we examine single power - laws that are consistent with both pre- and post - jet break closure relations . out of the 48 afterglows in our sample that are fit by a single power - law ,",
    "none of the afterglows are solely consistent with post - jet break and not pre - jet break relations .",
    "these single power - law light curves do not easily fit into the canonical picture unless they are either a short snapshot of one segment or are the post - jet break component and therefore relevant to this study .",
    "often these light curves are plagued by a low signal - to - noise ratio and few counts , which leads to minimal information to be extracted .",
    "other light curves in this group are dominated by large flaring during part or all of their light curves , which therefore makes determination of the underlying afterglow shape impossible during that time interval .",
    "we fit only the portion of the light curves that clearly returns to the underlying non - flaring level . however , there are a few examples of outliers that do not have flares and do have strong counting statistics .",
    "the most notable and best sampled x - ray afterglow in this outlier group is that of grb 061007 which displayed a very bright exceptionally smooth single power - law .",
    "( 2007 ) showed that this must be either due to a very late - time jet break requiring enormous kinetic energy or an exceptionally early jet break ( @xmath99 ) with highly collimated outflow from a jet that includes continuous energy injection throughout .",
    "we do not exclude these isotropic models with extreme energy requirements from our global study , but these extreme energy requirements are a valid concern addressed in  [ sec : energ ] .",
    "we attempt to filter the single power - laws that are a result of a short pre - jet break segment from those that represent a post - jet break decay . in the context of the canonical x - ray afterglow",
    ", we should be able to look at the relationship between observation start and stop times , and the temporal decay to distinguish pre- and post - jet break .",
    "figure [ fig : singlepl ] shows the relationship between the time that the observations begin and the time of last detection as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "unfortunately there are only 14 redshifts measured of the 48 total grbs in this category that are consistent with at least one post - jet break closure relation . therefore , to include as many potential jet breaks as possible , the times used in the following distinctions are in the observed frame and not the rest frame .",
    "there appears to be a general trend that suggests that those single power - laws for which observations began late ( @xmath100 s ) tend to be steeper ( @xmath101 ) than those that start early and continue for a long observation .",
    "we make a cut in this parameter space and deem those afterglows that start within or traverse the time frame for which we would expect jet breaks ( from the prominent sample ) and have steep ( @xmath102 ) decays as possible jet breaks and add them to that sample .",
    "these 6 bursts are indicated in figure [ fig : singlepl ] .",
    "the remaining single power - law afterglows that appear to be pre - jet break are put into the unlikely jet break category .",
    "we present the complete sample of possible jet breaks in table [ table : possible ] .",
    "the probable jet break time for each light curve is identified as @xmath103 .",
    "however , some ambiguity still remains of whether this is the time of the jet break .",
    "therefore , we also list the @xmath86 and @xmath104 ( the time of last detection , if relevant ) because they provide limits on the jet break time if the jet break is not @xmath103 . using the completeness criteria described in  [ sec : prominent ] , we find that at least @xmath105 of the possible jet breaks and @xmath106 of the unlikely jet breaks were observed sufficiently long enough that we would expect to have seen a jet break during their observations .",
    "the 6 afterglows that are inconsistent with all closure relations after internal consistency checks , but have temporal behavior of their final segments similar to prominent segments iii - iv or ii - iv are also included in the unlikely jet break sample .",
    "the breaks in these cases may be due to origins other than those in the canonical model such as transition of the cooling frequency through the x - ray band or compton processes .",
    "they may also be contaminated by small scale flaring that is not removed by our methods .",
    "they are denoted in table [ table : possible ] by `` none '' in the requirements field .",
    "the criteria , inputs , and final memberships of the prominent , hidden , possible , unlikely , and non - jet break categories are summarized in table [ table : summary ] .",
    "the non - jet break category includes all remaining bursts , most of which are segment i - ii transitions .",
    "we evaluated the statistical significance of the jet breaks identified by closure relation distinctions by running a series of monte carlo simulations .",
    "these specific samples include those grbs for which we have a distinct segment iv , ambiguous segment ii - iii , segment i - ii - iii with no segment iv , and single power - laws .",
    "we generated 1000 mock sets of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath98 , and @xmath107 for each segment in each simulation by drawing random numbers from the gaussian distribution of each of these parameters from the real data .",
    "these 1000 sets of light curve parameters for each sample are fit with the closure relations as we did with the real data including the application of the internal consistency checks .    the monte carlo simulations are used to determine how many hidden jet breaks might result from random variations in @xmath9s and @xmath10s due to measurement errors .",
    "the fraction of hidden jet breaks in this randomized sample indicates to us how many false hidden jet breaks we would expect to see in the real sample .",
    "based on the simulations , we would have expected @xmath108 final segments only consistent with post - jet break closure relations , compared to the 12 found in the real data .",
    "therefore , at least half of these hidden jet breaks appear to be real .",
    "we measure jet opening angles using the methodology of & racusin ( 2007 ) , originally derived from ( 1999 ) and ( 2001 ) where the opening angle of a uniform jet is defined as : @xmath109 @xmath110 where @xmath4 is the inferred jet half - opening angle , @xmath111 is the jet break time in days , @xmath112 is the redshift , @xmath113 is the assumed radiative efficiency , @xmath114 is the ambient number density in @xmath115 , and @xmath116 is the rest frame isotropic equivalent energy radiated in gamma rays between 1 kev and 10 mev in units of @xmath117 ergs .",

    "the other categories of jet breaks have even narrower opening angles corresponding to even earlier potential jet breaks .",
    "these earlier breaks may be largely due to post - jet - breaks - with - energy - injection or contamination by light curve breaks that are not jet breaks at all .",
    "only 85 of our total 230 grbs have measured redshifts . for candidate jet breaks without measured redshifts ( indicated by dashes in tables [ table : prominent]-[table : possible ] ) ,",
    "we assume @xmath126 or @xmath127 , and @xmath128 ergs to get an estimate ( or limit ) on @xmath4 ( @xmath129 ; eq .",
    "[ eq : xi ] ) .",
    "the redshift values of @xmath126 or @xmath127 that we assumed for grbs without measured redshifts is the mean redshift of _ swift _ long and short grbs , respectively for our sample .",
    "these values are similar to those discussed in the literature ( jakobsson et  al .",
    "2006b ; bagoly et  al .",
    "2006 ; fiore et  al .",
    "2007 ) . however , the measurements in the literature were based on the first two years to the _ swift _ mission when the mean redshift was slightly higher .",
    "more recent estimates suggest that the redshift in the third year of the _ swift _ mission is lower .",
    "this difference in redshift has only a small impact on the derived opening angles .",
    "we use the median value of the @xmath123 distribution from those long grbs with measured redshifts to estimate @xmath4 and @xmath122 for those grbs without measured redshifts .    for those x - ray afterglows where the last light curve break is consistent with one of the post - jet break closure relations , we list the jet half - opening angle ( @xmath4 ) , model requirements , and input parameters in tables [ table : prominent]-[table : possible ] , whether we have measured or assumed the required relevant parameters .",
    "we show the distributions of measured @xmath103 , @xmath4 , and @xmath122 for all of those light curves in the prominent , hidden , possible , unlikely , and non - jet break samples in figure [ fig : energetics ] , and compare the distributions for those with redshifts and measured @xmath123 and those for which we had to assume average values .",
    "there is no significant difference between the distributions with and without measured redshifts .",
    "we can now characterize the energy budget of these grbs .",
    "using our measurements of @xmath4 and @xmath123 from the sources described above , we calculate @xmath122 , the collimated grb energies , as : @xmath130 these values and limits are listed in table [ table : prominent]-[table : nojb ] .",
    "the distribution of @xmath122 is plotted in the right panels of figure [ fig : energetics ] .",
    "compared to pre-_swift _ optical jet break measurements which tightly cluster around @xmath131 ergs ( bloom et  al . 2003 ) , our sample is less energetic , with a median value for the long bursts with estimated @xmath123 in prominent jet break sample of @xmath132 ergs .",
    "this measurement is in agreement with that obtained by & butler ( 2008 ) .",
    "there are several different observational categories of potential jet breaks that do not look like the conventional jet breaks that strictly follow the canonical form on which previous studies have focused .",
    "these categories include post - jet break segments with energy injection in segment iii where the normal isotropic models do not fit , apparent segment ii - iii light curves in which the latter segment requires a post - jet break model suggesting they are actually segments iii - iv , apparent segments ii - iii that have temporal decays suggestive of a iii - iv or even a ii - iv transition , other segments iii that require a post - jet break model and can not be fit by any of the isotropic models , and single power - laws that are apparently post - jet break .",
    "those classifications for which we are at least somewhat confident are included in the prominent , hidden , and possible jet break categories .",
    "those that have some characteristics suggestive of post - jet break decay , but have temporal decays are similar to pre - jet break decays are placed in the unlikely jet break category .",
    "perhaps the most unexpected of these categories is the post - jet - break - with - energy - injection scenario which has been suggested as an alternative option to explain specific grb afterglows ( panaitescu et  al .",
    "2006 ; oates et  al . 2007 ;",
    "schady et  al . 2007 ; de pasquale et  al .",
    "2008 ) . the idea of energy injection continuing after the jet break has intriguing implications for jet break studies .",
    "energy injection would have the effect of making the temporal decay shallower than the underlying jet break until the energy injection ends , which would then manifest as another break in the light curve .",
    "this implies that sometimes the break between segments ii and iii is not caused by the cessation of energy injection in the isotropic model but rather by continuation of energy injection through the jet break with the break to segment iv occurring only after energy injection ceases .",
    "we find 4 examples in the prominent jet break category and 7 in the hidden jet break category which require this scenario to explain our model fits , in addition to many other segments iii that are consistent with post - jet - break - with - energy - injection models .",
    "this is significantly larger than the @xmath133 that we would have expected from our monte carlo simulations .",
    "these specific bursts are indicated in table [ table : prominent]-[table : hidden ] with the alternative jet opening angle and jet break time listed for all of those for which at least one post - jet - break - with - energy - injection model is consistent .",
    "many single power - law light curves can be explained within the context of the canonical light curve formalism by observing biases ( e.g. late start times , early stop times ) .",
    "however , there are several exceptions .",
    "some simply have large errors in @xmath9 due to light curves with few bins .",
    "a few well constrained outliers remain , the most notable being grb 061007 , whose light curve extends from 80 s to nearly one million seconds after the trigger , with a continuous , well constrained , steep , smooth temporal decay .",
    "if we assume that these afterglows behave like the canonical light curve , these results imply that the steeper single power - laws are post - jet break decays where the preceding light curve segments were either missed due to a late start or masked by flaring activity . in order to gauge the likelihood of these exceptions being pre- or post - jet break , we calculate the expected collimated energy outputs limits ( @xmath122 ) in the method described in  [ sec : energ ] for these bursts if the jet breaks were prior to the start of the observations or after the end of the observations ( figure [ fig : singlepl_egam ] ) . those bursts for which the observations extend beyond the time frame for which we would expect a jet break based on the behavior of the prominent jet break category require enormous collimated energy outputs ( @xmath134 ergs ) , suggesting that the jet break was prior to the observation start .",
    "these early jet breaks are difficult to explain in terms of the canonical form .",
    "there are 10 of these single power - law afterglows that persist through the entire expected jet break time window , 3 of which have very well sampled light curves ( grb 050716 , grb 061007 , grb 061126 ) .",
    "the 2 other than grb 061007 have relatively shallow decays ( @xmath135 ) , suggesting they are pre - jet break .",
    "( 2008 ) and ( 2008 ) demonstrate inconsistencies between the optical and x - ray properties of grb 061126 suggesting an additional component in needed to explain the x - rays which is outside of the standard model .",
    "these bursts remain enigmatic and are difficult to understood in the context of the majority of _ swift _ burst .",
    "they may have exceptionally late jet breaks , or perhaps do not break at all , implying a large jet opening angle or perhaps isotropic outflow .",
    "another variation on the unusual non - canonical light curve categories are those with segments i - ii where segment ii has a slope of @xmath2 and is consistent with the normal spherical decay closure relations as well as the normal decay with energy injection relations .",
    "there are 19 light curves in our sample that fit these criteria .",
    "this deviation from the canonical behavior implies either that these grbs did not experience the energy injection phase , or that segment i was misidentified due to flaring behavior .",
    "these objects may be similar to the shallow single power - law light curves except that their steep decay was observed first .",
    "in fact , 5 of these light curves fit our completeness criteria like those exceptional single power - law cases , implying that they are unusually long lived for segments ii or iii .",
    "perhaps the lack of energy injection or cause of this phase differs somehow from that of the canonical afterglows .",
    "it is interesting to note that these x - ray light curves ( after segment i ) would have been considered normal in the pre-_swift _ era .",
    "we have unearthed many additional jet break candidates in the data , but the fundamental question remains : why do more afterglows not have obvious jet breaks ?",
    "the most straightforward and plausible explanation for the lack of conventional jet breaks in xrt light curves is simply that the observations end before the jet breaks occur .",
    "the more fundamental question is what makes these afterglows for which we do not observe jet breaks different from those for which we do observe jet breaks ?",
    "we have some cases of jet breaks at very late times ( @xmath136 s ) . at these times , the fluxes are low , and uncertainties on the data points are large , making it difficult to detect jet breaks .",
    "in fact , many light curves end before this time frame , in which case we could be missing the jet breaks completely .",
    "( 2008 ) simulated grb afterglow light curves based on real xrt data and showed that hidden jet breaks could be present in even well sampled xrt light curves .",
    "we evaluate the probability that such a bias exists within our data set by doing a similar exercise , calculating the last time at which a jet break could occur without being detectable . this time",
    "is determined by forcing an additional break into the light curve with a slope equal to @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the measured slope of the last light curve segment .",
    "we then find the earliest break time that increases the overall @xmath38 by 2.7 ( corresponding to @xmath31 confidence for one parameter of interest ) .",
    "we refer to this time as the jet break lower limit ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "we excluded light curves with segment iv from this analysis , and find that an additional @xmath140 of the light curves could not be fit in this way ; in these cases the jet break limit is the time of the last detection .",
    "the distributions of times of last detections , jet break lower limits , and times of potential jet breaks in both the observed frame and rest - frame are shown in figure [ fig : tlastdet_dist ] .",
    "the distributions of jet break times for the prominent , hidden , and possible jet break categories overlap , with the latter sample peaking at an earlier time .",
    "this might be due to contamination in the possible jet break sample by breaks that are not jet breaks .",
    "these other breaks may be from the segment ii - iii transition , or the previously mentioned jet - breaks - with - energy - injection ( between segments ii and iii ) which tend to occur earlier than other ( segment iii - iv ) jet breaks .",
    "the important thing to extract from figure [ fig : tlastdet_dist ] is that the majority of the bursts in the unlikely jet break and non - jet break categories have last detection and jet break lower limits consistent with the range of prominent jet break times .",
    "it is probable that these light curves had jet breaks after xrt observations ended or that were buried within the noise of the late time data .",
    "there are a few exceptions to this , particularly in those single power - law light curves mentioned above that would have had to have their jet breaks very early ( few @xmath141 s ) and did not break even beyond the expected jet break times .",
    "perhaps these few bursts are fundamentally different from those with jet breaks .",
    "we also included short hard grbs ( shbs ) in our study of jet breaks , treating them the same as the long bursts except in the calculation of @xmath123 .",
    "only the brightest x - ray afterglows of shbs were included in our study , which may bias the understanding of this group in terms of the faint and quickly fading subsample that did not meet our minimum requirements .",
    "the shbs were placed into similar jet break subsamples as the long grbs ( i.e. 2 prominent , 4 possible , 3 unlikely , and 4 non - jet breaks ) .",
    "the shbs have on average smaller values of @xmath123 and @xmath122 than the long bursts .",
    "those shbs that show jet breaks and similarity to the canonical model perhaps have some fundamental differences in their environments or physical mechanisms from those that simply fade quickly ( troja et  al .",
    "2008 ; sakamoto & gehrels 2009 ) .    comparing this work to other recent studies of jet breaks in x - ray afterglows ( burrows & racusin 2007 ; willingale et  al . 2007 ; panaitescu 2007 ; kocevski & butler 2008 ; liang et  al . 2008",
    "; evans et  al . 2008 ) , we find significant overlap with our jet break candidates .",
    "most differences can be attributed to differing interpretation of light curve fitting and flaring and generally more limited jet break definitions in those other studies .",
    "each study used independent jet break criteria and there were several different independent data analysis pipelines .",
    "our work builds upon these other studies with our systematic analysis of the interaction between all of the light curve regions for each burst , broad closure relation model usage , careful searches for jet breaks buried in the data , and characterization of the energetics and limits .",
    "pre-_swift _ expectations for grb x - ray afterglows have been substantially revised with the great wealth of xrt observations .",
    "while we try to categorize and classify their properties , there is still a wide range of unexplained diversity in grb afterglow properties . within the limits of theoretical expectations and observational biases ,",
    "we have attempted to survey the properties of the x - ray afterglows .    in agreement with some previous studies ( & racusin 2007 , 2008 , 2007 , & butler 2008 , 2008 ) ,",
    "we find only a small fraction ( @xmath0 ) of our total sample has a late - time break that is clearly a jet break justified by the closure relations .",
    "we find an additional @xmath142 with observational biases that make segments iv non - distinct but with a strong case for post - jet break temporal and spectral properties .",
    "some of the bursts in our sample remain ambiguous in the jet break designation . despite not being able to make absolute claims about these specific bursts , we demonstrate that there are jet breaks hidden within the data and observational biases .",
    "this suggests that there are @xmath143 more jet breaks in the xrt afterglows than previous studies have revealed and at least @xmath144 of the missing jet breaks can be attributed to observational biases .",
    "some of our light curves that require energy injection to continue post - jet break may have been previously misidentified as the end of the energy injection phase .",
    "\\(2008 ) also explores the canonical x - ray afterglow form using the xrt sample , where they find that less than half of all light curves behave canonically , and one quarter are `` oddballs '' .",
    "many of these `` oddballs '' can be explained by the scenarios we use to describe the ambiguous cases discussed in this paper . while their approach is somewhat different , their conclusions are similar to ours .",
    "our study requires post - jet break energy injection to explain 4 cases of the prominent jet break sample and 11 others in the hidden jet break category .",
    "this modification to the canonical x - ray afterglow form alters expectations from simply studying the light curve alone , and adds to the theory needed to explain the diversity of observed properties .",
    "these explanations do not solve all of the remaining problems related to jet breaks .",
    "several afterglow light curves , particularly the ones who can only be fit by a single power - law , persist with a constant slope prior to and beyond the times for which we would expect a jet break .",
    "these bursts require either an exceptionally early jet break ( sometimes before @xmath145 sec ) or an exceptionally late jet break , requiring a large jet opening angle and an enormous ( @xmath134 erg ) collimation corrected energy output .",
    "_ swift _ grbs are on average at higher redshifts , smaller jet opening angles , lower isotropic equivalent energies , and lower collimated @xmath3-ray energies compared to grbs observed prior to _ swift_. some of these effects can be attributed to the lower energy coverage and superior sensitivity of the _ swift _ -bat .",
    "however , the consequences of these observational biases towards selecting different sorts of bursts is unexpected .",
    "one of the fundamental predictions of the jet break models used in this work is achromatic behavior in a single spectral component .",
    "the jet break should be a purely geometrical effect and should therefore not be limited to the x - ray afterglows",
    ". other components of the afterglow geometry may be more closely tied to emission segments and mechanisms making direct afterglow comparison difficult .",
    "modeling of the complete spectral energy distribution would be necessary to understand how the spectral breaks might influence the chromatic light curve behavior .",
    "this would be further complicated by uncertainties in the optical extinction and x - ray absorption .",
    "these detailed spectral studies , which are beyond the scope of this work , would provide additional information if simultaneous optical , infrared , and radio observations were available to narrow down the closure relations models and better constrain the physical models .",
