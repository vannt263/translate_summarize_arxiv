    "recent development in quantum information processing and quantum computation has attracted much attention to the study of discrete quantum systems with finite degrees of freedom .",
    "the most commonly used model is an array of interacting two - level systems ( 2ls ) each of which representing a qubit . as the system almost always interacts with its environment , quantum decoherence in the system",
    "usually is the most serious obstacle of actual implementation of quantum information processors @xcite .",
    "for this reason a detailed understanding of quantum decoherence in open systems is crucial .",
    "there are a handful models useful for such studies , the quantum brownian motion(qbm ) @xcite is one , the spin - boson model @xcite is another : the system in the former case is a harmonic oscillator and in the latter case a 2ls , both interacting with an environment of a harmonic oscillator bath ( hob ) .",
    "most qubit models presently employed are the results of picking out the levels most relevant to the description of the qubit from a multi - level structure . in atom optics , internal electronic excitations",
    "are often approximated by a 2ls consisting of the ground state and the excited state .",
    "a similar model is used for the study of low temperature tunneling process where the two levels degrees of freedom represent the quasi ground states in a double well potential .",
    "the simplification to two - levels allows for detailed analytical or numerical treatment , but this remains an approximation applicable only when the effect of higher levels are negligible , e.g. , at low enough temperature when higher levels are not populated .",
    "however , in the presence of gate operation , the existence of higher levels causes a leakage of the 2ls due to transitions to other levels . some extra perturbation may be necessary to select or restrict multi - level structure into the particular levels of interest@xcite . in order to make a quantitative estimation of decoherence with a leakage effect , it is more desirable to study open system models which maintain the multi - level structure .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the aspects of realistic qubits naturally arising from qbm , taking advantage of a fairly good understanding from the detailed studies over the last few decades .",
    "in particular , we focus on harmonic qbm , which can be viewed as an @xmath0-level spin - boson model . commonly used two - level spin - boson model can be obtained by restricting the harmonic oscillator fock space to the lowest two levels .",
    "this correspondence allows for a detailed analysis of the spin - boson model from the known results of qbm .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the _ non - markovian _ aspects of decoherence .",
    "non - markovian dynamics , often neglected in the literature ( models are mainly based on a markov approximation ) for technical simplicity , is actually of crucial importance for the realistic implementations of quantum information processing .",
    "the ` effective ' model we consider here invokes a two level simplification from a multi - level structure .",
    "how realistic this is certainly depends on the way the qubits are defined and realized in the multi - level structure usually encountered in actual experimental conditions .",
    "nevertheless our model is able to capture the characteristic short time behavior common in many physical examples . beyond the commonly assumed ohmic spectrum for the bath",
    ", generic non - ohmic environments can be studied with this model .",
    "contrary to the ohmic case , the sub - ohmic environment ( including @xmath1 type ) causes nontrivial long time behavior such as anomalous diffusion or localization @xcite owing to the long range temporal bath correlation .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , the influence of slow environment can be dynamically decoupled from the system by using relatively slow pulses@xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we will mainly focus on the opposite case of supra - ohmic environments@xcite .",
    "owing to the ultra - short time bath correlations , nontrivial short - time system dynamics enters , which is particularly difficult to describe by means of other models or approximations . the decoherece time scale in the supra - ohmic environment",
    "can be much shorter than the one in the ohmic case and thus is hard to remove by external pulses .",
    "thus supra - ohmic environment can be a major obstacle for the realization of quantum computation and information processing .",
    "we need to emphasize that to fully follow the coherence of an open system where self - consistency is required , because of the back - action from the environment , we need to study non - markovian processs .",
    "we will also argue that , for a generic class of environment , markovian approximations are not strictly valid .",
    "to facilitate comparison with results in related papers we will compare our methods with other commonly used approximations to the spin - boson model , such as the born approximation and the born - markov rotating - wave approximation@xcite for two - level and multi - level systems .",

    "although the large anharmonicity also prevents the leakage in the long term , the initial large leakage we saw can not be completely eliminated for the reason we mentioned before .",
    "when we apply our formalism to the metastable state , eventually the system state will leave the harmonic oscillator phase space into other metastable states via tunneling . the harmonic approximation of coherent dynamics",
    "is expected to be accurate at initial times when the time scales associated with these nonlinear effects are large compared to the decoherence time scale . in our example , the deviation from the markovian prediction is evident in the very early stage of the system evolution up to @xmath187 $ ] even for an intermediate temperature . for the realistic implementation of qubits , the underlying potential landscape leading to the discrete energy level is already known by design@xcite .",
    "our approach based on e2l - sbm is suitable in this situation and will give a more precise estimate of the open system dynamics than the one based on the conventional 2ls approximation .",
    "in particular , our results are directly relevant to the superconducting phase qubit models @xcite . in the superconducting qubits ,",
    "the major source of decoherence is the noise induced by the interaction with the current or charge sources mainly during the qubit manipulations .",
    "we have not considered other possible sources of decoherence such as the coupling to defects or nuclear and magnetic spins .",
    "multilevel structure in the superconducting flux qubits was studied in @xcite by born - markov approximation without control fields .    for the system - environment coupling we considered in eq.([hi ] ) , the fock state is not an eigenstate of the interaction hamiltonian and is subjected to a complex decay even under the born - markov approximation as shown in sec .",
    "previous study in the high temperature limit indicates the pointer state under this system - environment coupling is a coherent state@xcite .",
    "our calculation based on the exact solution for qbm indicates that , beyond the weak coupling regime , the environment - induced effect has a crucial impact on the system dynamics at an early stage .",
    "a factorized initial condition is used to derive our main results in accord with the initialization scheme used commonly in quantum information processing @xcite . from the decoherence study of qbm in the presence of the initial system - bath correlation due to the preparation effect@xcite , we expect that our results are robust and should hold for a more general class of initial conditions .",
