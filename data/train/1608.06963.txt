    "the emergence of topological order in fractional quantum hall effect has broadened our understanding of phases of matter @xcite .",

    "were thought to be characterized by different symmetries and their possible phase transitions were associated with a broken symmetry .",
    "since the different fractional quantum hall states have exactly same symmetries @xcite , they are beyond the description of landau symmetry - breaking theory and can not be distinguished by local order parameters .",
    "microscopically , topological order corresponds to patterns of long - range entanglement @xcite .",
    "the topological entanglement entropy can be used as an nonlocal order parameter to identify the topological phases @xcite .",
    "topological orders are of basic scientifically interest not only for their topological properties such as fractional quasiparticle statistics @xcite but also for their profound application in naturally fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite .",
    "this application mainly relies on the topological robustness of degenerate ground states @xcite and their patterns of long - range entanglement @xcite .",
    "topologically ordered states can arise as degenerate ground states of certain hamiltonian of system on a riemann surface .",
    "its ground - state degeneracy depends on the genus or holes of the riemann surface . because any two orthogonal sectors in ground - state space are connected by non - contractible loop operators",

    "it protects the coherence of information encoded in this manifold . on the other hand ,",
    "the patterns of long - range entanglement make each sector robust against local perturbations as well .",
    "the effects of the former and the latter seem to be error - free similarly for phase flip and bit flip models , respectively .",
    "these properties of such systems are attractive for constructing a very robust memory register @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional spin - lattice models exhibit topological orders @xcite .",
    "however , such models usually include many - body interactions that have not been found in naturally physical systems . without this limitation ,",
    "feynman suggested that @xcite a well - controlled quantum system can be used for the efficient simulation of other quantum systems and promises to have potential applications in studying detailed quantum phenomenon of inaccessible quantum systems .",
    "quantum simulation could be realized by various physical platforms such as trapped ion @xcite , superconducting circuit @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite , and so on .",
    "there have been a lot of successful demonstrations of quantum simulation in condensed matter physics @xcite , high - energy physics , atomic physics , quantum chemistry @xcite , and cosmology ( see the review of @xcite and references therein ) .",
