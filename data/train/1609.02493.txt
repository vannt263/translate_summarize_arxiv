    "we computed stokes @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 images from the raw data using @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the instrumental polarization ( ip ) was 0.89@xmath40.05% , as measured with hd 31398 , and was subtracted from the observations of ab aur in the @xmath20-@xmath21 plane ( see appendix [ app : ip ] for more details ) .",
    "we note that at the disk center , where the highest sensitivity is achieved , the uncertainty in @xmath15 is dominated by the uncertainty associated with the ip correction ( @xmath40.05% ) .",
    "the raw data obtained for ab aur consisted of 80 frames , which permitted us to check for inconsistencies and anomalies within the data .",
    "we divided the data into a number of subsets and reduced them separately .",
    "results from different subsets were in good agreement with each other , which ruled out the possibility that the net polarization detected from ab aur arose as a result of short - term seeing or pointing fluctuations , either of which could result in movement of the psf of a bright , compact emission source during the exposure .",
    "the 10.3-@xmath1 polarization map centered on ab aur is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : data ] .",
    "the angular resolution achieved in our observation is 035 , or 50 au at 144 pc , corresponding to the full - width at half - maximum intensity of the profile for the psf standard hd 31398 .",
    "extended emission from the disk of ab aur is spatially resolved ( fig .",

    "although the disk of ab aur is not precisely pole - on , we do not observe any significant elongation in the total intensity ( i.e. , stokes @xmath19 ) image , nor do we see any prominent gaps or spiral arms resembling the features observed at other wavelengths @xcite . however , there is some structure evident in the polarized intensity ( @xmath24 ) contours , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] , which are elongated roughly along the major axis of the disk .",
    "for several widely considered dust alignment mechanisms such as radiation alignment torque ( rat ) , elongated grains are aligned with short ( spin ) axes parallel to the b - field lines @xcite .",
    "consequently , polarization due to absorption of background flux is in the same direction as the b - field , whereas polarization due to emission is orthogonal to it .",
    "hence , the polarization process must be clarified to eliminate this 90ambiguity .",
    "generally , mid - ir polarization along a particular line of sight can arise from dichroic emission , absorption , or both @xcite .",
    "( note that the process of scattering is often regarded as negligible in the mid - ir , but we will consider this process below ) . in the case of ab aur , however , the contribution of dichroic absorption to the total polarization must be very small , because the disk of ab aur is close to pole - on , with no evidence of significant mid - ir absorption from intervening material in an envelope or the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite . supporting",
    "this conclusion is that the visual extinction toward ab aur is only 0.25 mag @xcite . using the interstellar extinction law from @xcite and the empirical relation between absorptive polarization and the optical depth @xcite",
    ", we estimate that this level of visual extinction translates into polarization values of @xmath00.04% at 10.3 @xmath1 , a factor of 10 less than the observed value ( 0.44% ) .",
    "the centrosymmetric component of @xmath15-vectors in ab aur s outer disk is remarkably similar to the observation at 1.6 @xmath1 ( i.e. , fig . 3 in @xcite ) , implying that , at least for the outer disk , polarization from scattering probably contributes significantly to the total polarization we observed there .",
    "this is an unexpected result , contradicting most , if not all , previous studies on mid - ir polarization in ysos , where polarization due to scattering is found , or assumed , to be negligible near 10 @xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to test our conclusions that the observed polarization of the protoplanetary disk of ab aur is a mixture of dichroic emission and scattering , we consider radiative transfer models of the disk that take into account both of these polarization mechanisms in the mid - ir .",

    "this results in uncertainty in the phase function",
    ". therefore , during the modeling , we adjusted the value of @xmath45 until the model s level of polarization from the outer disk ( 70 @xmath23 170 au ) matched the observed polarization .      to implement dichroic emission and absorption into the model , elongated grains are needed .",

    "the absorption and scattering coefficients ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) for these two orthogonal directions are calculated using the ddscat numerical code @xcite , with the axis ratio of the oblate grains fixed at 1.5 , a value considered to be reasonable by theoretical studies @xcite . to compute the amount of polarized emission and absorption produced by a population of such oblate grains embedded in a disk , we use the ray - tracing algorithm presented in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the grain s spin ( short ) axis is parallel to the b - field , as one might expect for rat .",

    "we constructed the polarization maps from the model as follows ( zhang et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "initially , radmc-3d computes the dust temperature and stokes parameters assuming only spherical grains ( as described in section [ subsec : model ] ) .",
    "these initial images include only ( unpolarized ) thermal emission and ( polarized ) scattered emission . with this temperature distribution in place ,",
    "the spherical grains are replaced with oblate spheroids .",
    "the ray - tracing program is then carried out to compute the polarized emission and absorption along each line - of - sight covering the entire modeling space .",
    "contributions to the polarized light from polarized emission and absorption are added to the @xmath20 and @xmath21 images obtained in the first step .",
    "finally , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 images are smoothed by convolving with a psf kernel to match the actual spatial resolution ( 035 ) and then combined to generate @xmath15-vector maps for comparing with the observations .",
    "note that in the second step above , all spherical grains are replaced with oblate spheroids .",
    "this may not be the case in a real disk , where the dust population is most likely to be a mixture of spherical and non - spherical grains .",
    "however , in the computation of polarized emission and absorption , spherical grains are not distinguishable from unaligned oblate grains : the inclusion of spherical grains would have the same effect on the results as a reduced alignment efficiency of oblate grains . in our simulations ,",
    "the alignment efficiency is described by the rayleigh reduction factor @xmath59 ( see discussion in section [ sec : best - fit ] ) .",
    "hence , although we do not explicitly include spherical grains in the computation of polarized emission and absorption , their effect has been taken into account in the modeling process .      to search for models compatible with the data , we added b - fields of various configurations into the basic disk model described in section [ subsec : model ] , and then examined the resultant polarization maps .",
    "we considered all axisymmetric fields discussed in @xcite , including standard poloidal ( i.e. , all field lines are parallel to each other and also to the spin axis of the disk ) , standard toroidal ( all field lines are circular and parallel to the disk plane ) , hourglass - shaped , helically twisted , `` knigl , '' and dipole ( bipolar ) fields .",
    "we also considered tilted b - fields whose symmetric axes are not parallel with the spin axis of the disk .",
    "the goodness of fit was first evaluated visually by superimposing the model with the data in order to narrow down the parameter space .",
    "then a quantitative comparison was conducted to determine the best - fit model .",

    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "it succeeds in reproducing all major features we observed , including the centrosymmetric pattern of @xmath15-vectors in the outer disk and a more aligned pattern nearer the star .",
    "the model strongly supports the conclusion that the mid - ir polarization from the disk of ab aur contains both dichroic emission and scattered polarization . for the inner disk , thermal emission at 10.3 @xmath1 overwhelms the scattered light by a factor of 100 - 1000 , and",
    "consequently the total polarization is dominated by the dichroic thermal emission from aligned dust . at larger radii ,",
    "thermal emission drops much faster than does the scattered light , and thus , polarization arising from scattering becomes increasingly significant ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ) . in the mid - ir",
    ", most photons available for scattering are emitted from the unresolved innermost part ( @xmath60 au ) of the disk , including the very hot ( @xmath01,500 k ) and compact ( @xmath61 au ) disk inner rim @xcite . with this illumination geometry , polarization due to scattering",
    "would show the signature centrosymmetric pattern , exactly as we observed in the outer disk of ab aur .",
    "the model supports the assumption that absorptive polarization is negligible .",
    "hence , the mean p.a . of the polarization across the central",
    "05 implies that the projected b - field of the inner disk is oriented at p.a .",
    "@xmath62 73 and ( probably coincidently ) roughly aligned with the disk s major axis .",
    "we found that none of the axisymmetric configurations mentioned above could reproduce this field geometry unless some degree of field tilt was applied .",
    "however , adding the field inclination as another free parameter greatly increased the size of the parameter space , which motivated us to only focus on the two simplest configurations : tilted poloidal ( straight field lines parallel to each other but not aligned with the spin axis of the disk ) and tilted toroidal ( circular field lines with planes not parallel to the disk plane ) . with this constraint , the best - fit model we found is for a poloidal field tilted from the spin axis of the disk by @xmath033 .",
    "the polarization p.a . indicates the _ projected _ field orientation , but it does not put direct constraints on the amount of field tilt ( i.e. , the angle between field lines and the spin axis of the ab aur disk ) . however , the radiative transfer simulations allow us to estimate the amount of tilt using not only the polarization p.a . but also the degree of polarization , with some assumptions on the dust shape and the dust alignment efficiency in b - fields . in our models ,",
    "the former is characterized by the axis ratio of the grains , while the latter is quantified by @xmath59 , the rayleigh reduction factor @xcite : grains completely aligned in the field with their spin axes parallel to the field lines have @xmath63 , while randomly oriented grains have @xmath64 .",
    "the field inclination ( 33 ) in the best - fit model is obtained by assuming @xmath65 and the axis ratio of dust grains to be 1.5 .",
    "we find that the derived field inclination does not strongly depend on @xmath59 : it only varies moderately between @xmath030 to @xmath040 when the value of @xmath59 changes from 0.3 to 0.03 .",
    "however , because of these additional assumptions and model degeneracies ( see appendix [ app : degeneracy ] ) , this value of 33 is not a precise measurement of the field inclination .",
    "rather , it represents a range ( @xmath030 - 40 ) of field inclinations that are consistent with the data . despite degeneracies and uncertainties in detailed values",
    ", we believe the conclusion that the b - field must be tilted is robust .",
    "starting from the standard poloidal configuration ( i.e. , field lines oriented perpendicular to the disk plane ) , the tilted poloidal field in the best - fit model can be obtained as follows .",
    "first , the field is tilted by 27 toward the observer along the p.a .",
    "= 160 ( i.e. , the projected spin axis of the disk ) so that the field lines are now parallel to the line - of - sight ( i.e. , the observer is now looking along the field lines ) .",
    "then , the field is tilted again by 20 along the p.a .",
    "@xmath62 73 ( or 253 , which is not distinguishable in this model ) . at this point",
    ", we are viewing a poloidal field almost , but not exactly , pole - on , with the observed polarization resulting from that relatively small component of the b - field projected on to the plane - of - the - sky ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .    estimating the field inclination in the best - fit model was aided by plotting the azimuthally averaged @xmath15 and p.a . against the deprojected distance to the star ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ) .",
    "we did not conduct the conventional @xmath66 minimization , because it was too computationally expensive to cover a large range of field inclination .",
    "however , the current `` best - fit '' model ( reduced @xmath67 ) should be sufficiently close to the one that minimizes @xmath66 .",
    "the best - fit model is also compatible with a tilted dipole ( or hourglass ) field if the scale of the field is large enough that its central part approximates a tilted poloidal field . on the other hand , the tilted toroidal field",
    "is probably precluded by the observations , because it can not reproduce the polarized intensity contours elongated roughly along the major axis of the disk ( fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] ) .",
    "moreover , a tilted toroidal field would require a high and probably unphysical field inclination ( @xmath6850 from the disk plane ) to reproduce the mean polarization p.a . of the inner disk .",
    "our analysis indicates the simplest field geometry that is consistent with the data , but , of course , the actual b - field configuration can be much more complex ( e.g. , with both poloidal and toroidal components ) than the one we present here .    in the `` best - fit '' model described above , the b - field",
    "is assumed to thread the entire disk of ab aur .",
    "however , we also considered a highly compact b - field confined to the innermost part ( @xmath69 au ) of the disk .",
    "this b - field has the same orientation with respect to the disk as the best - fit field , but it only penetrates the central 20 au - diameter region . polarized thermal emission arising from such a b - field would be unresolved by canaricam , but it could appear to extend to radii larger than 10 au due to psf smoothing .",
    "this model b - field configuration therefore permits us to access in more detail the possibility that the observed central polarized light is not actually resolved spatially .",
    "the result from our simulations , which use the observed psf , implies that , compared to the observed polarization distributions ( figs .",
    "[ fig : data ] and [ fig : fit]a ) , this model predicts polarization that declines too rapidly with radius . for regions immediately outside the central resolution element , this model can only account for @xmath030% of the observed degree of polarization .",
    "hence , we conclude that the effect of psf smoothing is not sufficient to explain the observed polarization from the entire inner disk , and that a highly compact b - field configuration is not favored by our observations .",
    "our model confirms that the degree of polarization due to scattering depends strongly on the grain size , specifically , the value of @xmath40 in eq .",
    "[ eq : size_distribution ] . for observations near 10 @xmath1 ,",
    "rayleigh scattering dominates if the grain size is sub - micron . in this regime",
    ", the polarization can be as high as 100% if the scattering angle @xmath70 , but sub - micron - sized grains have very small albedo at 10 @xmath1 , and therefore their contribution to the observed polarized light is small . on the other hand ,",
    "if the grains are too large ( e.g. , comparable to the observing wavelength ) , the degree of polarization due to scattering ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) approaches zero .",
    "a quantitative analysis of this size dependence is given by @xcite . in our model",
    "we find that @xmath40 must be @xmath01 @xmath1 to correctly reproduce the level of polarization observed in the outer disk of ab aur .",
    "a higher ( lower ) @xmath40 would make polarization too high ( low ) to be reconciled with our observations .",
    "models with only one polarization component , due to either emission or scattering but not both , have also been considered .",
    "if the centrosymmetric pattern observed in the outer disk were from emission by aligned dust grains , the b - field in that region would have a significant radial component , which is in stark contrast to the b - field morphology of the inner disk .",
    "we have attempted to reproduce this field geometry with an hourglass - shaped field viewed roughly along its symmetry axis .",
    "this results in an approximately poloidal field at the disk center with an increasing radial component toward larger radii . however , it is very difficult for this configuration to match the observations , because the centrosymmetric pattern produced by such a field rapidly disappears when the line - of - sight deviates even slightly from the symmetry axis of the field .",
    "in contrast , the same pattern produced by scattered polarization is very robust and able to maintain the symmetric shape when the line of sight is inclined from the spin axis of the disk .",
    "we find that scattering alone is also unable to reproduce all the observations .",
    "the disk of ab aur is close to pole - on , and our model suggests that more than 90% of the 10-@xmath1 photons available for scattering originate in a small region close to the star ( @xmath72 au ) and",
    "unresolved at our instrumental resolution ( 50 au ) . under this illumination geometry",
    ", scattered emission would produce a clear centrosymmetric polarization pattern , not only in the outer disk but also in the inner disk , which is not observed .",
    "[ fig : fit ] shows that the degree of polarization is more or less `` flat '' inside about 70 au from the star .",
    "this is hard to explain with scattered emission that , according to our model , would result in decreasing polarization toward the disk center .    in the near - ir ,",
    "a `` polarization disk '' may result entirely from scattering in the envelope of a yso @xcite .",
    "however , in this scenario , multiple scattering ( mainly double scattering ) produces polarization vectors along the disk s major axis , which is the opposite of what we observed .",
    "in addition , our simulations confirm that the intensity of single scattering is already very small compared to thermal emission in the inner disk of ab aur , and multiple scattering is essentially negligible .",
    "it is shown by @xcite that a uniform polarization pattern aligned with the minor axis of a disk can be produced by self - scattering , given that the disk is moderately inclined ( e.g. , 45 ) and optically thin .",
    "the latter is generally true for cm - mm observations of disks .",
    "however , the disk interior of ab aur is optically thick near 10 @xmath1 and the inclination is low ( 27 ) , so our observations can not be explained by that mechanism .",
    "the mean p.a . of the 10.3-@xmath1 polarization across the inner disk of ab aur is 163@xmath43 .",
    "this is very close to the p.a . of a jet known to be associated with ab aur @xcite .",
    "although dust grains may be aligned mechanically in a jet / outflow , we have concluded that the polarization most likely originates on the disk surface rather than at the jet for the following reasons .",
    "first , deep mid - ir images suggest that the jet is not detected at 10.3 @xmath1 .",
    "this indicates that the jet does not significantly contribute to the mid - ir flux @xcite .",
    "therefore , even if dust grains are aligned in the jet outflow , they are not likely to produce any detectable mid - ir polarized emission .",
    "second , because the disk is optically thick in the mid - ir , if there were any polarization footprints left by the jet , we would only see them on the front side of the disk .",
    "this would result in a noticeable asymmetry in the polarization map between the nw and se parts of the disk , which is not observed .",
    "the 10.3-@xmath1 polarimetry probes the physically and optically thin , warm surface layer , which contains much less than 0.1% of the surface density of a protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "however , while thin , this layer is nevertheless of essential importance for mri to operate in the disk . using mid - ir polarimetry as a surface - specific probe",
    ", our observations reveal the distinctive footprint of an ordered b - field existing near the disk surface , supporting the idea that mri - induced accretion and angular momentum transport can operate through , or near , this layer .    in the ideal mhd limit ,",
    "both analytical and numerical studies of non - turbulent cores show that , if the b - field and the spin axes of the core are aligned , the formation of rotationally supported disks is suppressed @xcite , at odds with the observed abundance of ysos surrounded by protoplanetary disks . a large - scale poloidal b - field tilted relative to the protostellar / disk spin axis , along with turbulence and",
    "other non - ideal mhd effects ( i.e. , ambipolar diffusion , the hall effect , and ohmic dissipation ) , has been proposed to alleviate this `` magnetic braking catastrophe '' @xcite .",
    "our observations imply that the misalignment hypothesis may indeed be key to understanding the formation of disks like ab aur s .",
    "a tilted poloidal configuration also means that there is a vertical ( i.e. , perpendicular to the disk plane ) component in the b - field . in numerical studies of mri - driven turbulence in protoplanetary disks",
    ", it is found that , without this vertical component , it is impossible to generate sufficient mri - driven turbulence and resultant accretion rates that are high enough to be consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "we note that in rat @xcite , a favored mechanism to mutually align dust grain spin axes , there is a critical field strength below which the process can not work regardless of properties of the radiation field or the grains . on the other hand",
    ", mri can be suppressed if the b - fields are too strong @xcite . if one accepts that both rat and mri are able to operate near the disk surface of ab aur , then some constraints can be imposed on the field strength ( @xmath73 ) , which is otherwise not measurable from our present data .",
    "following @xcite , the critical field strength ( @xmath74 ) , below which grains can not be aligned in the scheme of rat , is ( using cgs units )    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the grain size , @xmath77 is the gas density , @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) is the dust ( gas ) temperature , and @xmath80 is the axis ratio of the grain . considering a grain size of 0.1 @xmath1 and @xmath80 of 1.5 , with other quantities sampled in the model at the layer of unity optical depth at 10.3 @xmath1 ( @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 au ( i.e. , the half width of the resolution element ) , where @xmath83 @xmath84 ( assuming a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 and a mean molecular weight of 7/3 ) and @xmath85 k , the critical field strength @xmath74 is about 800 @xmath86 g ( or @xmath87 t ) .    to enable mri , the b - field energy density should be lower than the thermal energy density .",
    "this criterion can be written as a condition on the plasma parameter @xmath88 , the ratio between thermal and magnetic pressure ( assuming keplerian disk ) @xcite    @xmath89    where @xmath90 , and @xmath91 ( @xmath92 the mass density , @xmath93 the isothermal sound speed , @xmath94 the boltzmann constant , @xmath86 the mean molecular weight , and @xmath95 the proton mass , all in cgs units ) . again , considering @xmath82 au on the @xmath81 surface , we have @xmath96 mg ( @xmath97 t ) . the field strength corresponding to @xmath98 ( i.e. , equipartition between thermal and magnetic energy ) should be considered an absolute maximum , which is about 30 mg ( @xmath99 t ) at the same location .",
    "therefore , we estimate that , to activate both the rat and mri mechanisms , the b - field strength must be of order of 1 - 10 mg at @xmath82 au .",
    "this field strength is significantly higher than that found for the interstellar b - field ( @xmath010 @xmath86 g ) , but comparable with those measured for much younger protostellar cores ( @xmath010 mg ) @xcite .    finally , we comment on the scattered polarization detected in the outer disk of ab aur .",
    "while commonly observed in the optical and near - ir regions , polarized scattered light has not been observed previously in the mid - ir for any protoplanetary disks .",
    "this polarization component carries no information about the b - field , but it shows that the maximum size is nicely constrained . in particular , our modeling implies that dust grains as large as @xmath01 @xmath1 are needed on the surface of ab aur s outer disk to be reconciled with the observation .",
    "this particle size is larger than that of typical interstellar grains ( 0.01 - 0.1 @xmath1 ) and likely results from grain growth , a crucial and expected step in the earliest stages of planet formation @xcite .",
    "moreover , since micron - sized or larger particles should settle toward the disk s mid - plane on timescales of @xmath010@xmath100 years @xcite , the presence of such grains near the surface of ab aur s 4 myr old disk implies vertical mixing and therefore that significant turbulence may be occurring even in the outer part of a disk like ab aur s .",
    "we present gtc / canaricam mid - ir ( 10.3 @xmath1 ) polarimetric observations with @xmath005 ( 50 au ) angular resolution of the protoplanetary disk of ab aur to explore its magnetic field .",
    "the key findings are summarized below :    1 .",
    "linear polarization is detected from the disk of ab aur out to @xmath101 12 ( 170 au ) .",
    "the polarization map shows two distinct regions , which we call the inner disk and the outer disk .",
    "polarization vectors in the inner disk ( @xmath102 au ) are approximately parallel to each other , whereas those in the outer disk ( 70 @xmath23 170 au ) form a clearly centrosymmetric pattern .",
    "the ( azimuthally averaged ) degree of polarization increases from 0.44@xmath40.05% near the star to 1.4@xmath40.4% at 170 au .",
    "we modeled the observations using radmc-3d with customized code to include polarization from emission and absorption by aligned elongated dust grains .",
    "our results show that the observed polarization is well reproduced when both polarized emission and polarization from scattering are included in the model . in the best - fit model ,",
    "the disk of ab aur is threaded by a poloidal field tilted from the spin axis of the disk by @xmath030 - 40 .",
    "polarization of the inner disk is dominated by dichroic emission from elongated grains aligned in the b - field .",
    "in contrast , polarization of the outer disk is largely due to scattering .",
    "the disk of ab aur is almost certainly optically thick at 10.3 @xmath1 , so mid - ir polarimetry probes emitting dust grains and the b - field in the warm disk surface .",
    "our observations imply that this surface layer is indeed magnetized , a crucial condition for mri to operate .",
    "furthermore , we estimate that , for both rat and mri to operate , the field strength on the disk surface should be of order 1 - 10 mg .",
    "a poloidal b - field tilted relative to the disk spin axis supports theories requiring such a misalignment to mitigate the `` magnetic breaking catastrophe '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". it also ensures a considerable vertical component of the field ( i.e. , perpendicular to the disk plane ) , which is needed to create a sufficiently high accretion rate through mri - driven turbulence as suggested by observations @xcite .",
    "significant polarization arising from scattering in the outer disk of ab aur requires micron - sized grains near the disk surface , indicating grain growth and possible lofting of these particles to the disk surface by turbulence .",
    "our study of ab aur is the first to probe b - fields in a protoplanetary disk with mid - ir polarimetry , and it demonstrates the potential of this technique . while our observations provide critical boundary conditions that must be satisfied by the b - field interior to the disk of ab aur , that interior b - field geometry remains otherwise undefined .",
    "other observing facilities , such as the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) and very large array ( vla ) observing at sub - millimeter and centimeter wavelengths , will permit probing of disk interiors all the way to the disk mid - plane , observations that will strongly complement those in the mid - ir .",

    "during the observations presented above , canaricam was mounted at the nasmyth - a focal station of the gtc . because the design of canaricam ensures a very low level of instrumental polarization ( ip ) , any ip present in the data arises predominantly from the 45 reflection off the telescope s tertiary mirror .",
    "therefore , the orientation of the ip is a function of telescope pointing and the position angle of the field - of - view ( fov ) , and is thus a known value ( accurate within a few degrees ) for every observation . the magnitude of the ip is a function of wavelength , with little temporal variation .",
    "numerous data from the commissioning and scientific operations of canaricam have confirmed that the ip is very stable .",
    "to double - check the ip in our observations , the mid - ir photometric standard hd 31398 , a bright giant of spectral type k3 with no expected intrinsic polarization , was observed along with ab aur .    the polarimetric image of hd 31398 ( the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hd31398 ] ) confirmed that both the magnitude ( 0.89@xmath40.05% ) and the orientation ( @xmath045 ) of the ip were in good agreement with the expected values .",
    "after ip subtraction using the standard procedure , the polarization of hd 31398 was essentially zero ( the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hd31398 ] ) . the same procedures to correct for ip",
    "were then applied to the ab aur data .    to further verify the accuracy of the ip correction and to look for any residual instrumental effects , we observed ab aur again on a different night .",
    "this additional data set and that presented in section [ sec : results ] are consistent with each other within the measurement uncertainties even though they were obtained with different telescope pointing and different fov position angles .",
    "this indicates that the ip correction has been applied properly , and that the polarization we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] is not instrumental .",
    "however , we chose not to combine the two data sets , because poor seeing degraded the angular resolution of the data obtained on the second night .",

    "are treated as fixed parameters , and their values are collected from the literature .",
    "we note that allowing @xmath103 and @xmath30 to change does not change our conclusion that grains significantly larger than typical ism grains are required , although the exact value of @xmath45 may vary moderately .    in the computation of emissive polarization , there are two previously noted parameters resulting in model degeneracies : the axis ratio of dust particles and the rayleigh reduction factor @xmath59 . a high degree of polarization can be a result of highly elongated dust grains with low alignment efficiency , or well - aligned particles of axis ratio close to unity . in the scheme of rat ,",
