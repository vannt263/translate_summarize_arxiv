    "descriptions of scattering in quantum field theory assume that at large times the particles are widely separated and behave like free particles .",
    "this assumption , which underlies the lsz  formalism , is incorrect for many theories .",
    "the most obvious example of this is when the incoming or outgoing system includes bound states , but it also fails if the physics is characterised by long range interactions .",
    "since most of the physics of the standard model falls into at least one of these categories ( confined quarks , massless gauge bosons ) it is very important to have a precise understanding of the dynamics of quantum field theories at large times .",
    "generally , then , it is assumed that at asymptotic times the heisenberg fields become free ones @xmath0 and similarly for @xmath1 .",
    "we should note that this behaviour can only be taken to hold as a weak limit , between matrix elements , since otherwise ( see sect .  5 - 1 - 2 of @xcite )",
    "one can show , from the kllen - lehmann representation , that the fields are free at all times .",
    "the limit in ( [ inout ] ) is sometimes discussed in the framework of an adiabatic approximation , in which the coupling constant is taken to be multiplied by a function which is one during the scattering process and approaches zero for very large ( positive or negative ) times .",
    "this is unsatisfactory since it assumes the desired answer which ought rather to emerge from the theory itself .",
    "it can also be wrong , as in the case of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "qed , the paradigm for the standard model , has long range interactions .",
    "the masslessness of the photon means that the potential between static charges falls off only as @xmath2 .",
    "it has been known for a long time  @xcite that this means that ( [ inout ] ) does not hold and that any attempt to impose such a relation generates infra - red ( ir ) divergences in the wave - function renormalisation constant of ( charged ) matter fields .",
    "this has been studied  @xcite in the relativistic theory by kulish and faddeev  ( kf ) and their general approach to asymptotic dynamics has been utilised by various authors , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "we shall now give a brief sketch of the procedure adopted by kf and what their results seem to indicate for qed .",
    "they considered the usual qed interaction hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ( conserved ) matter current . in order to carry out the lsz reduction of the @xmath5-matrix we must be in the interaction picture so that , although the time evolution of the states is determined by ( [ intham ] ) , the evolution of the fields themselves is given by the free hamiltonian .",
    "one may then insert the free field expansions in ( [ intham ] ) .",
    "these plane wave expansions are @xmath6 where the notation implies a sum over the @xmath7 indices . working in feynman gauge we have @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 . inserting these into ( [ intham ] ) results in eight terms which may be grouped according to the positive and negative frequency components of the fields .",
    "each of these pieces will have a time dependence of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 involves sums and differences of energy terms .",
    "kf claimed that , for @xmath13 , only terms with @xmath12 tending to zero contribute to the asymptotic dynamics . since the spatial integration in ( [ intham ] ) generates a momentum delta function , only four terms with @xmath14 would then have a large @xmath15-limit .",
    "this vanishing of @xmath16 can only take place in qed because the photon is massless , and it only occurs for soft photons , i.e. , for @xmath17 .",
    "this is in accord with perturbation theory : the breakdown of the @xmath5-matrix occurs for soft photons and giving the photon a small mass acts as a cut - off on these divergences .",
    "an asymptotic approximation to ( [ intham ] ) is obtained from the lowest order term of the taylor expansion , in powers of @xmath18 , of the hamiltonian .",
    "this yields @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the charge density @xmath22 according to kf therefore , the asymptotic hamiltonian is the integral over all momenta of the current associated with a charged particle of velocity @xmath23 .",
    "this non - vanishing hamiltonian finds its perturbative expression in the branch cuts , rather than poles , in the on - shell green s functions in the matter fields of qed .",
    "an attractive aspect of this theory is that it completely dispenses with the adiabatic approximation .",
    "although this discussion seems to pick up the problems in applying the lsz  scheme to qed and , in particular , correctly identifies the problem with long wavelength ( @xmath24 ) photons , it can not be regarded as the end of the story .",
    "these arguments are used extensively in other theories , such as qcd , where the physics is not well understood , and where greater reliance is put on the mathematics . on the other hand the theory is employed at the level of operators whereas it is more appropriate , in quantum field theories , to work at the level of matrix elements and weak limits .",
    "the kf approach also makes no connection between the large time limit and the separation of particles at large distance . as we shall see below",
    ", the naive application of this approach to massive @xmath25 theory would indicate that the lsz  formalism should also break down , which it very evidently does not .",
    "this paper is concerned with constructing a new approach to asymptotic dynamics within the context of weak convergence , and with appropriate physical boundary conditions corresponding to the separation of particles .",
    "we will apply it to a variety of interactions and show that it yields results which are completely consistent with what is known from explicit perturbative calculations .    in sect .  2",
    "we will show that the kf  argument can not be applied to four point interactions .",
    "3 , which is the heart of this paper , develops the method for massive  @xmath25 theory and then applies it to both the three and four point interactions of scalar qed . in this way we will see both the well known spin independence of the ir  structure in the abelian theory with massive charges and , for the three point vertex , regain the results of  @xcite",
    "a discussion of the implications of these results for perturbative calculations in the standard model is presented in sect .",
    "some technical details are given in appendices .",
    "as we have indicated in the introduction , there are objections to the kf view of asymptotic dynamics : firstly , that the statements have been framed specifically for the picture of the @xmath24 infra - red theory , which is well known to suffer from divergences , and not as a general statement on the behaviour of asymptotic limits ; secondly , and more critically , that the prescription does not translate to other quantum field theories .",
    "it is the latter objection which is the most serious and the one which we shall now demonstrate .    to be precise",
    ", we shall show that the kf argument applied to the case of massive @xmath25 theory is not sufficient to show that the asymptotic limit of the coupling term vanishes . however , @xmath25 theory is the standard textbook example of an interacting quantum field theory and its perturbation theory is straightforward  the coupling must vanish for well separated particles .    to begin then , let us take the standard free field expansion of the scalar field @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 the mass of the particle .",
    "the commutator relations are @xmath29=(2\\pi)^3\\,2e_k\\,\\delta^3({{\\boldsymbol k}}-{{\\boldsymbol k}}')\\ ] ] and the interaction part of the hamiltonian for the theory under consideration is then @xmath30 where the : : indicates normal ordering .    when the expansion ( [ fe1 ] ) is inserted into ( [ ham1 ] ) and the resulting expression is simplified , then , after normal ordering , it will be found to consist of twelve terms , each of which has an exponential term where the exponent is made up of sums and differences of the energy eigenvalues .",
    "some of these exponents are obviously non - vanishing . according to the methods of kf which were described in the introduction",
    ", the integrals containing these exponentials may be ignored .",
    "however , not all of the integrals involved have exponents which are so easily dealt with and one of these , which we shall now consider , is @xmath31 applying the methods described in the introduction , any non - vanishing asymptotic dynamics will come from those terms and those momenta for which the exponent vanishes . to this end",
    "we must determine if the equation @xmath32 has any solutions .",
    "far from this being a difficult problem , upon reflection it becomes obvious that there are infinitely many solutions !",
    "this is most easily seen by noting that the problem is equivalent to that of finding solutions to the simultaneous system of equations @xmath33 the incoming and outgoing momenta must have some connection with a scattering process so that the obvious , trivial solutions , which can be found by taking , say , @xmath34 , will be ignored .        referring to fig .",
    "[ vecs1 ] , let @xmath35 and @xmath36 now imagine pivoting the rigid triangle @xmath37 , with the line @xmath38 as the hinge , to get a new triangle which is congruent to @xmath39 if the new triangle is @xmath40 then take @xmath41 and @xmath42 the vectors @xmath43 then automatically satisfy both the conditions of ( [ exl ] ) .",
    "one can do this with any two non - parallel vectors , for example ( with @xmath44 ) take @xmath45 another example is @xmath46 and @xmath47    no physical meaning could be given to such an arbitrary set of momenta .",
    "following the arguments of kf however , we conclude that the existence of this wide range of momenta for which ( [ exp1 ] ) vanishes , indicates that the asymptotic dynamics of the system is determined by this set of points",
    ". this would suggest that problems could arise in the associated perturbation theory for massive @xmath25 theory , and this is well known to be false for this textbook example of a quantum field theory .    at this point",
    "we wish to stress that this apparent contradiction has implications beyond this simple example as there are many important quantum field theories , such as qcd and the higgs mechanism , in which four point interactions have a major role .",
    "if there is a deficiency in the understanding of the asymptotic dynamics in this simple scalar four point theory then it is difficult to see how one might proceed on this basis , with any confidence , in other theories of the standard model .",
    "it is clear from this that the kf argument needs considerable refinement if it is to be applied to the standard model .",
    "the major flaw in the kf argument is its reliance on strong operator convergence . instead of concentrating on the hamiltonian itself",
    ", we shall focus our attention on matrix elements .",
    "the limits we shall consider are weak limits and this is in keeping with the lsz formalism in quantum field theories .    if @xmath48 represents an incoming wave packet in this scattering experiment and @xmath49 is an outgoing wave packet , then the matrix element of interest is @xmath50 .",
    "this is a time dependent c - number and the elementary notion of convergence may be adopted in the investigation of its asymptotic limit . in the case of massive scalar @xmath51",
    "it will be shown that , under conditions which have a straightforward physical interpretation , its asymptotic limit is zero .",
    "this section is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "[ phi ] we shall use massive @xmath51 theory as a vehicle to study asymptotic dynamics . having established the basic method and shown that it is consistent with what is already known for @xmath25 theory , we shall then employ it to determine the asymptotic dynamics of scalar qed .",
    "there is a particularly interesting feature of scalar qed which makes the study of its asymptotic dynamics worthwhile .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian in scalar qed consists of a sum of two terms , a three point interaction term , similar to that in ( fermionic ) qed , and a four point interaction term , which has no parallel in qed , so that the dynamics of scalar qed is richer than that of fermionic qed . from perturbation",
    "theory it is known that ( fermionic ) qed and scalar qed have the same infra - red problems , so their _ asymptotic _ dynamics are the same .",
    "perturbation theory also tells us that the four point interaction term is divergence free so it must have vanishing asymptotic dynamics .",
    "we would expect this to emerge , in a natural manner , from any satisfactory theory which describes the asymptotic dynamics of scalar qed .",
    "further , since the infra - red problem is spin independent , the asymptotic dynamics of the three point interaction will , with the obvious changes , be the same in either fermionic or scalar qed .",
    "we shall begin our examination of scalar qed in sect .",
    "[ quartic ] with the quartic term , which turns out to be the easier to deal with .",
    "we shall show that its asymptotic dynamics is similar to that of the scalar @xmath25 theory and has a zero limit .",
    "after this , in sect .  [ cubic ] , we shall turn our attention to the cubic term and the infra - red problem .",
    "we shall prove that the asymptotic dynamics for the infra - red problem is exactly the same as that for a system in which the hamiltonian is derived from a current associated with a moving charged particle with known , non - trivial asymptotic dynamics .",
    "consider the following incoming and outgoing wave packets .",
    "@xmath52 with the functions @xmath53 being test functions for the wave packets .",
    "referring to ( [ fe1 ] ) , ( [ com1 ] ) , ( [ ham1 ] ) , and the expressions ( [ pks1 ] ) , one finds that @xmath54 reduces to a single integral which is proportional to @xmath55 with the exponent @xmath12 having the value @xmath56    notice that the exponent in this term has essentially the same structure as the term in ( [ trm1 ] ) which appeared to cause problems when applying the methods of kf .",
    "the difference now is that ( [ trm2 ] ) is a straightforward integral and not an operator , so that elementary methods may be applied to find the asymptotic limit .",
    "the machinery we shall employ is the _ method of stationary phase _",
    "briefly , this says that , provided there is no point in the region of integration at which all of the first order partial derivatives of @xmath12 are zero , then the integral ( [ trm2 ] ) tends to zero as @xmath57    the terms in @xmath12 have the form @xmath58 and , since @xmath59 they will all have first - order partial derivatives for all values of @xmath60 the first order derivatives of @xmath61 are then given by @xmath62    if at some point all of these are zero then , in particular , @xmath63 for all possible values of @xmath64 this implies that @xmath65 and @xmath66 so we must also have @xmath67 if we can exclude the set of points for which this condition holds from the domain of integration , then the integral in ( [ trm2 ] ) will vanish as @xmath68    in ( [ trm2 ] ) , the test functions @xmath69 for the the incoming wave packet have the variables @xmath70 as arguments .",
    "the expressions @xmath71 and @xmath72 represent the velocities of the respective incoming wave packet .",
    "experimentally , scattering is prepared by setting up the apparatus in such a way that the two beams of particles are brought together from different directions , i.e. , with different velocities .",
    "this information can be incorporated into the incoming wave packet by ensuring that the supports of the test functions exclude the possibility that @xmath67 the precise statement of the requirement is that _ the test functions @xmath69 must have non - overlapping supports in velocity space .",
    "_ this condition on the test functions , of having non - overlapping supports in velocity space , is central to the construction of the @xmath5-matrix ( see sect .",
    "13.4 of @xcite ) .",
    "to restate , if the test functions @xmath69 have non - overlapping supports in velocity space then the integral in ( [ trm2 ] ) vanishes as @xmath68 this is exactly the behaviour that one would expect for this particular scattering process but a further question remains to be answered : what constraints does this choice of test functions for the incoming wave packet impose on the outgoing wave packet ?",
    "if this picture is to display all of the features of this particular scattering process then some combinations of outgoing particles must be excluded .",
    "the outgoing particles must behave as free particles at asymptotically large times which means that , as was the case for the incoming wave packets , their test functions must also have non - overlapping support in velocity space .",
    "however , this must be a consequence of the condition imposed on the test functions for the incoming wave packet and not an independently imposed condition .",
    "the arguments of the test functions for the outgoing wave packet are @xmath73 and @xmath74 and the equality of these two variables is equivalent to @xmath75 .",
    "this is simply the expression of conservation of momentum .",
    "another principle in any scattering theory is conservation of energy . in this case",
    "this is expressed as @xmath76 finally then , we must show that the two conditions @xmath77 are incompatible with the functions @xmath69 having non - overlapping support in velocity space . since the masses of the two incoming particles are equal , the equation @xmath78 is equivalent to @xmath79 and non - overlapping in velocity space is equivalent to non - overlapping in momentum space . in this case",
    "_ we need to show that if _ @xmath80 _ then the conditions of _ ( [ con1 ] ) _ are impossible_.    again , for simplicity , let us take the mass @xmath81 the first equation in ( [ con1 ] ) means that the vectors @xmath82 are coplanar . in that case",
    ", we may choose a unit vector @xmath83 orthogonal to this plane and write @xmath84 since @xmath83 is orthogonal to the plane of @xmath85 we have @xmath86 with similar expressions for @xmath87 this means that ( [ con1 ] ) may now be written as @xmath88 from the triangle inequality we know that this is only possible when @xmath89 and @xmath90 are parallel , i.e. if there is a number @xmath91 such that @xmath92 in terms of @xmath70 and @xmath93 this can be rearranged into the form @xmath94 the only solution for this is with @xmath95 so that @xmath96    there are other possible matrix elements that are associated with the four point interaction term .",
    "there is the possibility that the incoming wave packet consists of a single field , with the outgoing wave packet made up of three fields , and there is the reverse .",
    "both of these cases may be treated in precisely the same manner as the above case , and with precisely the same conclusions .",
    "we omit the details .",
    "the interaction in scalar qed is more complicated than that of qed due to the existence of the extra term representing a four point interaction . in this section",
    "we shall study the asymptotic properties associated with this term and show that it has trivial asymptotic dynamics .",
    "this will require extending our techniques since we shall have to deal with wave packets which have massless particles as an essential part of their structure .",
    "the method of stationary phase that was used to determine the limit of ( [ trm2 ] ) , in sect .",
    "[ phi ] , was dependent upon some of the properties of the partial derivatives ( [ drv1 ] ) of the various energy eigenvalues . in the case of _ massless",
    "_ particles the energy eigenvalues , which are of the form @xmath97 are not differentiable at the origin but this will not be a barrier to the application of this technique .",
    "we begin by writing out the full , normal ordered interaction hamiltonian for scalar qed , which is @xmath98 with : : being normal ordering and where the current @xmath99 is given by @xmath100 with the obvious meaning given to the components of @xmath101 defined in ( [ cur1 ] ) .",
    "we shall work in feynman gauge and take the plane wave expansions given by @xmath102 the commutator for the photon is given by @xmath103=-(2\\pi)^32\\omega_kg_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta^3({{\\boldsymbol p}}-{{\\boldsymbol q}})\\ , . \\ ] ]    when ( [ fe2 ] ) is substituted into ( [ ham2 ] ) and rearranged , the quartic interaction will be found to consist of 12 terms , each of them with differing exponential terms corresponding to the different possible interactions .",
    "we shall consider the matrix element represented by the following diagram .",
    "@xmath104    we shall take as our wave packets the following expressions @xmath105 where the @xmath106 are the respective test functions .",
    "one then finds that the amplitude @xmath107 is a single term , constructed from @xmath108 which is an integral proportional to @xmath109 where @xmath110    notice that the einstein summation convention means that this integral is actually a sum of three integrals , with @xmath111 the incoming and outgoing charged fields must be separated , i.e. , the test functions @xmath112 and @xmath113 must have disjoint support . if not , then , by conservation of momentum , there will be no separation of the incoming and outgoing photons . in that case , no scattering will have taken place .",
    "thus it must follow that , _ for each _",
    "@xmath114 , the test functions @xmath115 must have disjoint support so that at least one of them will not have the zero vector in its support . without loss of generality ,",
    "let us suppose that this is @xmath116    the function @xmath12 will then have continuous partial derivatives in @xmath117 and these are given by @xmath118 the vanishing of these expressions for all @xmath119 would then imply that @xmath120 which is impossible , since the former is a unit vector while the latter is not .",
    "the method of stationary phase ( applied only to the variables @xmath117 ) can again be used to prove that ( [ trm3 ] ) will vanish as @xmath121    there are other possible scattering events that are described by this four point interaction hamiltonian , e.g. , when the wave packets consist of two incoming photons and two outgoing charges ( or vice versa ) .",
    "if the photons are separated according to our scheme ( their test functions have disjoint support ) , then a similar exercise will show that this picture also gives rise to vanishing asymptotic dynamics .",
    "the cubic term in the interaction hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) , which comes from the @xmath122 term in ( [ cur1 ] ) , is made up of two parts , @xmath123 and @xmath124 these two terms are similar in their structure and both contribute to the problem of infra - red divergences .",
    "we shall consider only the first of these , @xmath125 the results for @xmath126 being substantially the same .",
    "as in qed , the infra - red problem in scalar qed occurs in relation to a scattering process in which an incoming charged particle emits a photon .",
    "@xmath127    we shall consider the case when the wave packets are given by @xmath128 the matrix element will then be found to be given by @xmath129 where @xmath130 now it is easy to see why the previous method _ can not _ be applied in this case .",
    "since the photon is massless , the corresponding energy eigenvalue is @xmath10 .",
    "the expression for @xmath12 , therefore , will not have partial derivatives in @xmath131 at @xmath132 and the partial derivatives in @xmath133 will vanish when @xmath134 for any value of @xmath135 it is this regime , when @xmath136 , which gives rise to the problem of infra - red divergences and the difficulties associated with its asymptotic dynamics can not be avoided .",
    "following kf we shall compare the asymptotic dynamics of this scattering process with that governed by the scalar version of the asymptotic hamiltonian ( [ hint_as ] ) .",
    "the system that we shall take for our comparison is then the one defined the _ asymptotic _",
    "current given by @xmath137 where we omit terms which do not contribute to this matrix element .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath138 if we take the incoming and outgoing wave packets ( [ pck3 ] ) and contract , in the usual fashion , with @xmath139 then we obtain the amplitude @xmath140 where @xmath141    the asymptotic dynamics of the systems defined by the interaction hamiltonians ( [ ham2 ] ) and ( [ ham3 ] ) , and the wave packets ( [ pck3 ] ) , will then be the same if we can prove that the difference between the integrals in ( [ trm4 ] ) and ( [ term5 ] ) vanish for asymptotically large time",
    ". this amounts to showing the following theorem whose proof is given in the appendix .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath142 be defined as in ( [ trm4 ] ) and ( [ term5 ] ) .",
    "then @xmath143g({{\\boldsymbol q}})q^\\mu h_\\mu({{\\boldsymbol k}})=0\\,.\\ ] ]    this shows that the physics of scattering in scalar qed at large times is fully described by the asymptotic hamiltonian ( [ ham3 ] ) .",
    "the four point interaction vanishes and the three point one can be described using the simple current ( [ cur2 ] ) .",
    "we have thus extended the results of kf to scalar qed and proved the spin independence of the asymptotic dynamics in abelian gauge theories .",
    "it is not necessary to _ assume _ that the coupling constant asymptotically switches off .",
    "as we have seen , one can , for theories like massive @xmath25 , prove that the asymptotic dynamics is free or , for theories like qed , with rather more effort , determine the form of this asymptotic interaction .",
    "the arguments for determining the asymptotic properties of interactions in quantum field theories , proposed by kulish and fadeev  @xcite , have been improved upon and made applicable to a more general type of interaction , including four point couplings .",
    "the principle refinement of our approach to the asymptotic dynamics is that we examine the asymptotic properties of matrix elements corresponding to specific interactions rather than considering operators .",
    "this has the advantage of requiring only the machinery for the convergence of sequences of c - numbers rather than the more elaborate needs of operator convergence .",
    "in the case of @xmath25 theory it was found that , when the incoming wave packet had test functions with non - overlapping supports in velocity space , the asymptotic interaction hamiltonian is weakly vanishing .",
    "this condition on the test functions , of having non - overlapping support in velocity space , is exactly that which is required in the lsz formalism and the construction of the @xmath5-matrix .",
    "our result is in complete agreement with perturbation theory and shows why it works .    in the case of scalar qed",
    "we used our methods to show that the matrix elements associated with the four point interaction term are all asymptotically trivial which is again in line with the results of perturbation theory .",
    "for the three point interaction term of scalar qed , our methods show how the asymptotic dynamics associated with the event of a charged particle emitting a photon can be shown to be exactly the same as that of a charged particle with known non - trivial asymptotic dynamics , and this conformed to the approximation given by kf .",
    "the spin independence of this result immediately translates to the fermionic theory .    what can we learn from this work about qed ?",
    "firstly that the coupling does not switch off  at large times .",
    "kf further showed that this implies that the lagrangian matter field does _ not _ asymptotically approach the free field of the plane wave expansion .",
    "rather there is a distortion factor which expresses itself in perturbation theory in the branch cuts ( instead of poles ) in the matter field two point function .",
    "they drew the conclusion from this that it is not possible to describe charged particles in qed .",
    "although this paper supports the non - vanishing of the interaction , we feel that this last conclusion is not justified .",
    "what one needs is to find the fields which do asymptotically approach the plane wave expansion and can therefore be interpreted as particles .",
    "( it is in fact clear from the start that the lagrangian matter can not hope to do this since it is not gauge invariant . ) that such fields exist has been shown elsewhere  @xcite and that their green s functions have a good pole structure has been amply demonstrated , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "these are the physical fields which should be identified with the charged particles seen in experiment .",
    "we would like to suggest here three further areas for study : massless qed is a theory with collinear divergences and as such a playground for understanding qcd .",
    "the asymptotic dynamics of this theory  @xcite requires further study , in particular the physical asymptotic fields need to be constructed .",
    "finite temperature field theory is another area where infra - red divergences are important , here , of course , the residual asymptotic dynamics of zero temperature will be acerbated by excitations from the heat bath . finally in qcd confinement",
    "shows that the interaction does not switch off and the strong interaction between quarks and gluons is indeed supposed to grow with the separation .",
    "the application of the methods of asymptotic dynamics and the construction of physical fields at short distances  @xcite could have implications for jets production .",
    "it has though been demonstrated that there is a topological obstruction to the construction of an isolated quark or gluon  @xcite , how this relates to non - perturbative effects in the asymptotic dynamics of qcd is a topic for future work .",
    "we would like to thank emili bagan and izumi tsutsui for valuable discussions and suggestions during the course of this work .",
    "in this section we shall provide a proof of theorem  [ main ] .",

    "let us recall the form of taylor s theorem for a smooth function @xmath178 , i.e. @xmath179 thus , for a fixed value of @xmath152 and a given @xmath180 there is a @xmath181 such that if @xmath182 then @xmath183 if the choice of @xmath184 is restricted to the set @xmath185 then @xmath186 such that @xmath187 we have @xmath188 for all @xmath189        * proof *   in the following discussions the value of the functions @xmath194 in ( [ asm2 ] ) are not important and the only property that is required of them is that they are test functions . for convenience ,",
    "therefore , we shall write the integral as @xmath195 with @xmath196 being a test function .    take a fixed value of @xmath152 and write @xmath197 as in lemma  [ lem1 ] , we shall first show that @xmath198 has a zero asymptotic limit . in the latter integral",
    "we have changed the variable from @xmath184 to @xmath199 so that now we are writing @xmath200 and @xmath201 the latter expression is in a form that will allow the use of taylor s theorem .",
    "let @xmath202 be the open cover of @xmath203 given by @xmath204 and let @xmath205 be a smooth partition of unity subordinate to this cover .",
    "we write the second integral in ( [ asm5 ] ) as the sum of two integrals by incorporating this partition , i.e. @xmath206 and we shall deal with @xmath207 first .    due to the presence of @xmath208",
    "the integral @xmath207 is defined on @xmath209 .",
    "now given @xmath210 such that if @xmath211 then @xmath212 from taylor s theorem , ( see ( [ taylor ] ) and the paragraph following it ) we can find a @xmath213 such that , for all @xmath214 if @xmath215 then @xmath216 , say . then if @xmath215 , we have @xmath217 where the latter integral is well defined , is independent of @xmath15 and has been obtained from the previous one by changing the variables .    the next step is to show that the asymptotic limit of @xmath218 is zero .",
    "for this we consider the last integral in ( [ asm6 ] ) as the difference of the two obvious integrals given by their exponential terms , i.e. @xmath219 with the final forms of @xmath220 being obtained by the obvious change of variables .",
    "note that @xmath226 and this will be zero for @xmath227 the exponent of the integral in ( [ fst ] ) is @xmath228 so that @xmath229 as @xmath230 , @xmath231 tends , uniformly in @xmath232 to @xmath233 , and since @xmath234 we have @xmath235 is bounded , uniformly in @xmath236 , strictly away from @xmath237 in a neighbourhood of @xmath238 it is also easy to check that @xmath231 is non - zero for any finite value of @xmath239    we now have @xmath240 with the latter expression being obtained after integration by parts in @xmath241 and noting that the boundary terms vanish .",

    "now let us write @xmath249 since @xmath248 is smooth and @xmath250 for @xmath251 the function @xmath252 is a smooth function which has the important property that it is zero for @xmath251 i.e. , @xmath253 has its support in @xmath254    the second integral in ( [ stp2 ] ) , which we denote by @xmath255 is now @xmath256 the last integral in ( [ lim1 ] ) is now written in a form which is more convenient and which is obtained by the following changes of variables .",
    "first replace @xmath257 by @xmath74 and then replace @xmath184 by @xmath258 the form of @xmath259 then changes to @xmath260 in order to deal with ( [ lim2 ] ) we shall first have to examine the second integral in ( [ two ] ) . applying the same methods to @xmath261 as we have to @xmath262",
    "one can easily show that @xmath261 can also be written as the sum of two integrals , as in ( [ stp2 ] ) , but with the exponent @xmath12 replaced with @xmath166 and @xmath263 replaced with @xmath264 where @xmath265 thus @xmath266 c.f .",

    "first define @xmath271 as @xmath272 i.e. , the @xmath273 in @xmath274 is replaced by @xmath275 then it is straightforward to prove , along the lines of lemma  [ lem1 ] , that , for all @xmath276 we have @xmath277 as @xmath193    secondly , we must show that @xmath278 as @xmath193 this is also straightforward and can be fashioned along the lines of the proof that @xmath279 as @xmath280 ( see ( [ asm6 ] ) and the paragraph that follows it . )",
