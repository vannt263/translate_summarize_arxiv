    "the fruitful running of babar , bell , cdf and d0 in the past years provides a very fertile testing ground for the standard model  ( sm ) picture of flavor physics and cp violations .",
    "although most of the measurements are in perfect agreement with the sm predictions , there still exist some unexplained mismatches , such as the so - called `` @xmath15 , @xmath16 puzzles '' , anomalous @xmath17 mixing phase , large transversal polarization in @xmath18 , mismatching forward - backward asymmetry for @xmath19 and so on .",
    "recently , some interesting measurements of @xmath20 decays have been reported by cdf collaboration at fermilab tevantron , @xmath20 decays have attracted much more attention .",
    "especially , cdf collaboration has made the first measurement of @xmath21 decay  @xcite @xmath22    the recent theoretical predictions for these two quantities based on the qcd factorization approach  ( qcdf)@xcite , the perturbative qcd approach  ( pqcd)@xcite and the soft - collinear effective theory  ( scet )  @xcite read @xmath23 we see that qcdf  ( scenario  s4 ) and pqcd results for @xmath3 are significantly larger than cdf measurement eq .",
    "( [ cdfexp ] ) . in scet ,",
    "the contributions involving internal charm quark loops are claimed to be nonperturbative and only can be determined by fitting to the data",
    ". a recent fit analysis of charmless b decays using scet gives the result eq .",
    "( [ scetvalue ] ) , which agrees with cdf data .",
    "all of the theoretical predictions for @xmath24 agree with cdf data for large error .    for this possible branching ratio mismatch",
    ", many efforts have been done within both sm and possible new physics  ( np ) scenarios , for example refs .",
    "@xcite . a recent detailed analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that @xmath25 and factorization only remain approximately valid if the branching ratio for @xmath21 exceeds its current value by at least @xmath26 , or if a parameter @xmath27 describing ratios of form factors and decay constants is shifted from its nominal value by more than twice its estimated error .",
    "such analysis also implies that , if @xmath28 and @xmath27 persist in the future , large @xmath3 mismatch is possibly induced by np effects .",
    "a new family non - universal @xmath4 boson could be naturally derived in certain string constructions  @xcite , @xmath29 models  @xcite and so on .",
    "searching for such an extra @xmath13 boson is an important mission in the experimental programs of tevatron  @xcite and lhc  @xcite . within a model - independent formalism for a family non - universal @xmath13 model presented by ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath30 transition involving @xmath31 coupling has been widely studied .",
    "it is interesting that such @xmath4 boson behavior is helpful to resolve many puzzles in @xmath30 transition , such as `` @xmath15 puzzle ''  @xcite and anomalous @xmath17 mixing phase  @xcite .",
    "so , it is worth evaluating the effects of a non - universal @xmath4 boson on @xmath32 transition , especially the measured @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , with the constraints from @xmath33 mixing , @xmath34 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath35 decays , a ckm - like hierarchy persists in @xmath4 coupling matrix ( at least between @xmath31 and @xmath36 couplings )  @xcite . naturally , it is important to evaluate whether such hierarchy is persisted after the constraints from @xmath21 are included .",
    "in addition , the correlated decays @xmath37 and @xmath2 , which also involves @xmath38  ( @xmath39 ) transition at quark level , will be measured on the running lhc .",
    "such decays may perform an important role in testing sm and searching for np signal .",
    "especially , due to large theoretical uncertainty vanishing , the ratio @xmath40 is much more suitable to test sm and probe np  @xcite .",
    "so , we also evaluate @xmath37 and @xmath2 decays within both sm and a family non - universal @xmath13 model .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we revisit @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays in the sm within the qcdf formalism ; we mainly evaluate the effects of annihilation contributions which involve endpoint divergency . in section 3",
    ", we perform a fitting on @xmath36 couplings with the constraints from @xmath41 mixing and @xmath21 decay ; the np effects on the other decays are also evaluated .",
    "section 4 is our conclusions .",
    "theoretical input parameters are summarized in the appendix .",
    "in the sm , the effective weak hamiltonian responsible for @xmath32 transitions is given as  @xcite @xmath42 +   { \\rm h.c.},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43  ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) are products of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa  ( ckm ) matrix elements  @xcite , @xmath46 the wilson coefficients , and @xmath47 the relevant four - quark operators .    in recent years",
    ", qcdf has been employed extensively to study the b meson non - leptonic decays .",
    "for example , all of the decay modes considered here have been studied comprehensively within the sm in refs .",
    "the relevant decay amplitudes for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays within the qcdf formalism are @xmath48\\,,\\nonumber\\\\   \\sqrt{2}{\\cal a}_{\\bar{b}_s\\to",

    "the expressions for the @xmath37 and @xmath2 amplitudes are obtained by setting @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "it is noted that the qcdf framework contains estimates of some power - suppressed but numerically important contributions , such as the annihilation corrections .",
    "unfortunately , due to the appearance of endpoint divergence , these terms usually could not be computed rigorously . in a model - dependent way , there are two schemes to regulate the endpoint divergence .",
    "scheme  i : in ref .",
    "@xcite , to probe their possible effects conservatively , the endpoint divergent integrals are treated as signs of infrared sensitive contribution and phenomenologically parameterized by @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 unrestricted .",
    "the different scenarios corresponding to different choices of @xmath56 and @xmath55 have been thoroughly discussed in ref .",
    "scheme  ii : as an alternative scheme to the first one , one could quote an infrared finite gluon propagator to regulate the endpoint divergent integrals , which have been thoroughly studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in scheme  i , with the central value of the input parameters listed in the appendix , fig .",
    "[ figbrphi ] shows the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath57 with @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . as fig .",
    "[ figbrphi](a ) shows , assuming @xmath61 , the minimal @xmath3 appears at @xmath62 and @xmath63 ; assuming @xmath64 , it appears at @xmath65 , as fig .",
    "[ figbrphi](b ) shows . with the above @xmath66 values , @xmath67 and the central values of the other inputs ,",
    "corresponding above two assumptions for @xmath55 , we get @xmath68 , @xmath69 respectively , which are also significantly larger than cdf data @xmath70 . moreover , corresponding to above two assumptions , we find the direct cp asymmetry for @xmath21 is @xmath71 , @xmath72 respectively , which are also lower than cdf measurement @xmath73 at @xmath74 level .",
