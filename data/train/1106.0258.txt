    "<S> a mn@xmath0 single - molecule magnet displays asymmetric berry - phase interference patterns in the transverse - field ( @xmath1 ) dependence of the magnetization tunneling probability when a longitudinal field ( @xmath2 ) is present , contrary to symmetric patterns observed for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> reversal of @xmath2 results in a reflection of the transverse - field asymmetry about @xmath4 , as expected on the basis of the time - reversal invariance of the spin - orbit hamiltonian which is responsible for the tunneling oscillations . a fascinating motion of berry - phase minima within the transverse field magnitude - direction phase space results from a competition between non - collinear magneto - anisotropy tensors at the two distinct mn sites .    </S>",
    "<S> almost two decades of research have established single - molecule magnets ( smms ) as prototype systems for understanding fundamental quantum phenomena associated with nanoscale magnetism @xcite , as well as demonstrating their potential for future applications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the most important characteristics of smms can be modeled reliably using a giant - spin approximation ( gsa ) whereby the molecule is treated as a rigid magnetic unit with total spin , @xmath5 , weakly interacting with its enviroment . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this model accounts for the essential features of the quantum tunneling of magnetization ( qtm ) observed in these molecules , as well as its quenching due to berry phase interference ( bpi ) resulting from different tunneling trajectories @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the gsa ignores the internal couplings within a smm , thereby completely failing to account for qtm transitions that involve fluctuations of the total spin of the molecule @xcite , or otherwise obscuring intrinsic relationships that exist between qtm selection rules and the underlying molecular structure @xcite . in a recent interesting example </S>",
    "<S> , it was demonstrated that a tilting of the zero - field splitting ( zfs ) tensors in a triangular mn@xmath6 smm ( lowering the symmetry of the spin hamiltonian from @xmath7 to @xmath8 ) results in new qtm selection rules and strongly affects the transverse field dependence of the remaining forbidden qtm resonances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these observations likely explain the absence of qtm selection rules in most smms studied to date , since internal dipolar fields and/or weak sample disorder are often sufficient to cause observable relaxation at resonances otherwise forbidden by symmetry . a detailed understanding of these and related phenomena has mostly been facilitated by studies of low nuclearity smms @xcite , where exact diagonalization of the multi - spin hamiltonian enables consideration of the internal degrees of freedom of the molecule .     </S>",

    "<S> we show that this behavior results from a competition between non - collinear magneto - anisotropy tensors at the two crystallographically distinct mn ions , which is also responsible for an unusual motion of the berry - phase minima within the transverse field magnitude - direction phase space . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the asymmetry can be inverted upon reversal of the longitudinal field ( @xmath16 easy axis ) , i.e. , the bpi pattern is invariant with respect to a full inversion of the applied field , consistent with the time - reversal symmetry of the underlying zero - field hamiltonian .    </S>",

    "<S> this angle , which lies @xmath35 away from one of the crystal faces , was deduced from the two - fold modulation of @xmath36 as a function of the orientation , @xmath37 , of a 0.2  t transverse field within the hard plane ( see inset to fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath38 oscillations in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a correspond to bpi , with minima at regularly spaced field values ( @xmath39 t ) . </S>",

    "<S> note that the regularly spaced @xmath26 bpi minima are invariant under inversion of @xmath1 , i.e. , they are symmetric with respect to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this is not the case in resonance @xmath32 , for which the behavior of the qtm probability is very different . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen in fig .  2b , which illustrates the dependence of @xmath43 on @xmath1 , for @xmath44 ( the angle for which the first bpi minimum at @xmath45  t is the sharpest ) . </S>",

    "<S> the inset to ( a ) illustrates the two - fold angular modulation of @xmath38 for @xmath50  t , providing clear evidence for a significant @xmath51-order rhombic anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry of the bpi pattern of oscillations in resonance @xmath32 is inverted upon reversal of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset to ( b ) illustrates the classical anisotropy barrier generated by the non - collinear zfs tensors ( see main text for explanation ) and the different perspectives resulting from permutations of @xmath52 and @xmath53.,width=325 ]    before considering this aspect in detail , we first discuss the asymmetric nature of the bpi oscillation pattern in resonance @xmath32 . as seen clearly in fig .  2b , reversal of the longitudinal field , @xmath2 , results in a reflection of the @xmath43 bpi pattern about @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the bpi minima _ are _ in fact invariant under a full magnetic field inversion , as required on the basis of the time - reversal invariance of the spin - orbit hamiltonian responsible for this physics . </S>",
    "<S> as noted above , the symmetries of bpi patterns must respect the symmetry of the zero - field spin hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> if one considers only 2@xmath41-order zfs within the gsa , then the resulting hamiltonian necessarily belongs to the orthorhombic point group and possesses the following symmetry elements : ( 1 ) three mutually orthogonal two - fold rotation axes ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) ; ( 2 ) three mutually orthogonal mirror planes ( @xmath46 , @xmath56 ) ; and ( 3 ) an inversion center . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) guarantees invariance with respect to reversal of @xmath1 , i.e. , it enforces symmetric bpi patterns , irrespective of whether a longitudinal field is applied ( @xmath57  0 ) or not ( @xmath26 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as we show below , one must break the @xmath46 mirror symmetry in order to obtain asymmetric bpi patterns with respect to inversion of @xmath1 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , reversal of @xmath2 results in different patterns ; the time reversal symmetry then guarantees that these two patterns are mirror images . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , no matter how many spatial symmetries are broken , the time - reversal invariance of the spin - orbit interaction guarantees that the bpi minima should be invariant under a full reversal of the applied field , i.e. , simultaneous reversal @xmath2 and @xmath1 , as we have confirmed experimentally .    </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to reproduce the essential features of the experiments by introducing @xmath58-order terms into the gsa ; the @xmath46 mirror symmetry can then be broken by rotating the coordinate frames of the @xmath51 and @xmath58-order tensors . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this approach also reproduces the complex motion of the @xmath43 minima within the @xmath59 phase - space shown in fig  3 . </S>",
    "<S> however , a complete gsa analysis for mn@xmath0-bet requires many parameters and provides little insight , while the same physics can be naturally understood within a multispin description which considers the internal structure of the mn@xmath0-bet molecule . </S>",
    "<S> note that the emergence of significant higher - order anisotropy terms within the gsa is a manifestation of mixing of the ground spin state with excited states , which can only be captured within a multi - spin model  @xcite . in this context , the @xmath46 mirror symmetry may be trivially broken by rotating ( tilting ) the zfs tensors at the two inequivalent magnetic sites in the molecule so that their local @xmath11-axes no longer coincide ( this is similar to the case of the mn@xmath60 smm discussed in the introduction  @xcite ) .    to explain the experimental findings we have diagonalized the multi - spin hamiltonian , where the four mn ions are coupled according to the sketch in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> @xmath61    the first term represents the local anisotropy of the @xmath62 ion , @xmath63 being the @xmath51-order zfs tensor ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 @xmath27 @xmath66 , with @xmath67 @xmath27 @xmath68 representing the axial and rhombic anisotropies , respectively ) ; the @xmath69 are euler matrices ( defined by euler rotation angles @xmath70 , @xmath71 @xmath27 @xmath72 ) specifying the orientations of these tensors . </S>",
    "<S> the second term is the zeeman coupling to the applied field , where we assume an isotropic land factor , @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the third and fourth terms represent the exchange and dipolar interactions , respectively . these terms are also time - reversal invariant , and do not change any of the preceeding arguments . as depicted in fig .  4a , </S>",
    "<S> three independent near - neighbor exchange coupling constants , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , are considered : @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . </S>",

    "<S> [ eqn1 ] ( solid red symbols ) . </S>",
    "<S> this simulation , which takes into account the small misalignement of the experimental field rotation plane  @xcite , employed the following parameters : @xmath82  k and @xmath83  k , with the easy and hard anisotropy axes along @xmath11 ( @xmath84 ) and @xmath54 ( @xmath85 ) , respectively ; @xmath86  k @xmath27 @xmath87 , with the axes rotated with respect to the central spin by identical euler angles @xmath88 , @xmath89 ( as required by inversion symmetry ) ; @xmath90 being zero for all ions ; finally , isotropic ferromagnetic exchange constants @xmath91  k , @xmath92  k and @xmath93  k are used . </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed that these parameters are additionally constrained by the locations of hysteresis loop steps ( fig .  1 ) and extensive angle - dependent epr measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the obtained anisotropy values for the mn@xmath10 ions are very similar to related mn@xmath10 complexes  @xcite , while the @xmath94 value lies within the bounds reported for other mn@xmath9 systems  @xcite . the quantitative agreement with experiment </S>",
    "<S> is also excellent . </S>",
    "<S> the motion of the @xmath43 minima can be understood as a result of the competition between different anisotropic interactions within the molecule , without a need to invoke unphysical @xmath58 and higher order anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the angular positions ( @xmath37 ) of the @xmath32 minima move with @xmath1 , while the @xmath26 minima remain stationary , as found experimentally ( fig .  3 ) .     </S>",

    "<S> 4c , the asymmetry is reversed upon inversion of @xmath2 , as required by the time - reversal invariance of the anisotropic interactions in eqn .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqn1 ] , and observed experimentally ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial ingredient is the tilting of the zfs tensors of the external spins , @xmath99 @xmath27 @xmath100 , relative to the central spins @xmath101 @xmath27 @xmath102 , so that the @xmath46 mirror symmetry is broken . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in the inset to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b , where one observes that the classical energy landscape is invariant under full field inversion ( blue vs. black arrows ) , while this is not the case when only @xmath1 is reversed ( red vs. black arrows ) . </S>",
    "<S> the euler angle @xmath88 results in a significant projection of the relatively weak anisotropy associated with the mn@xmath9 ions into the hard ( @xmath46 ) plane . </S>",
    "<S> this , together with the finite @xmath103 parameters and the dipolar interactions , results in competing transverse interactions and to the complexity of the bpi patterns observed in fig .  3 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the dipolar interaction has a very significant effect on the energy levels of the molecule : the zfs within the @xmath104 multiplet varies by as much as @xmath105 when dipolar interactions are omitted , and the location of the @xmath106 qtm step is shifted by @xmath107 t .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by noting that asymmetric bpi patterns have been seen in other centro - symmetric smms for which a clear explanation has been lacking  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present results may help shed light on the effect that symmetric anisotropic interactions can have in magnetic systems with inversion symmetry , where a net antisymmetric interaction is strickly forbidden . </S>",
    "<S> the present work clearly demonstrates how studies of simple low nuclearity systems can address fundamental symmetry considerations related to qtm in molecular nanomagnetism . </S>"
