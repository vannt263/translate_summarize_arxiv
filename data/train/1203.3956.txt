    "high energy experiments with polarized beams and targets have opened a new window for revealing qcd dynamics and hadron structure . based on qcd",
    "factorization theorems , polarization - dependent cross sections generally can be factorized into the convolution of perturbatively calculable hard parts and universal nonperturbative ( soft ) parts which are expressed through various spin - dependent parton correlation functions . among these functions ,",
    "higher - twist spin - dependent correlation functions are poorly known in comparison to the three leading - twist ones : the spin - averaged parton distribution @xmath1 , the helicity distribution @xmath2 , and the quark transversity @xmath3  @xcite . along with leading - twist distributions ,",
    "the higher - twist correlation functions provide us with important information on the structure of hadrons , even though they do not have a probability interpretation .",
    "the best way of extracting them is to investigate spin observables which have no leading - twist contribution .",
    "a classic example is the twist-3 double spin asymmetry @xmath0 ( longitudinally polarized lepton beam , transversely polarized target ) in inclusive deep - inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) , which allows one to study the parton correlator @xmath4 . in the case of nucleon - nucleon scattering ,",
    "the double spin asymmetry @xmath0 in the drell - yan process , involving two polarized incident hadrons , has been extensively investigated for the purpose of studying higher - twist correlators  @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xmath0 for inclusive lepton production from the decay of @xmath5-bosons in proton - proton scattering and for jet production in lepton - proton scattering has been derived  @xcite . in this letter",
    "we focus on the double spin asymmetry @xmath0 for direct photon production in nucleon - nucleon scattering , which also allows one to study twist-3 spin - dependent parton distributions as leading effects .",
    "in contrast to the aforementioned processes , direct photon production contains a complete set of collinear twist-3 correlation functions in a transversely polarized nucleon .",
    "the crucial tool required for the extraction of twist-3 correlation functions is collinear higher - twist factorization , which has been established in studying transverse single spin asymmetries ( ssas )  @xcite .",
    "the exploration of ssas in hadronic reactions has a long history , starting from the mid 1970 s .",
    "in particular , the large size of the observed ssas for single inclusive hadron production  @xcite came as a big surprise and , _ a priori _ , posed a challenge for qcd , because the collinear parton model predicts the asymmetries are proportional to @xmath6  @xcite , where @xmath7 is the quark mass and @xmath8 is the transverse momentum of the final state hadron .",
    "however , significant ssas in hadronic collisions may be generated by going beyond the naive parton model and including collinear twist-3 parton correlators , as was first pointed out in  @xcite , and later on studied in more detail  @xcite .",
    "( we also note that alternative mechanisms underlying the large ssas have been proposed  @xcite . ) in the process @xmath9 , the collinear twist-3 formulation has some relation to a description in terms of transverse momentum dependent parton correlators ( tmds )  @xcite , provided that initial / final state interactions in the tmd approach are taken into account  @xcite . in particular , for semi - inclusive dis and related processes , tmds are of crucial importance ( see for instance  @xcite and references therein ) . for these reactions , also intriguing nonzero spin / azimuthal asymmetries were observed  @xcite . in the recent past , important progress was made in understanding various spin observables in terms of the collinear twist-3 approach and/or the tmd approach . to mention just one example",
    ", it was found that for certain structure functions in semi - inclusive dis the two formalisms provide the same result at intermediate transverse hadron momenta  @xcite , which can be viewed as a nontrivial consistency check .    by using the collinear higher - twist approach we are able to compute the pertinent spin - dependent cross section ( numerator of the asymmetry @xmath0 ) for direct photon production in nucleon - nucleon scattering and express it in terms of twist-3 parton distributions . in sect .",
    "ii , we briefly review the factorization formalism as it applies to the first non - leading term of an expansion in powers of @xmath10 , with @xmath11 denoting the transverse momentum of the observed photon .",
    "we also list the twist-3 correlation functions that appear in the factorization formula and provide the complete twist-3 spin - dependent cross section .",
    "we conclude the paper in sect .",
    "for definiteness we consider the process @xmath12 where we indicated the 4-momenta and the polarization states of the particles .",
    "furthermore , we define the mandelstam variables through @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . on the partonic level one has @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 representing the longitudinal momentum fractions of active partons coming from the transversely polarized nucleon and the longitudinally polarized nucleon , respectively .",
    "the generic form of the ( spin - dependent ) cross section reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 @xmath23 indicates a twist-2 ( twist-3 ) parton distribution , while @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the corresponding perturbatively calculable coefficient functions .",
    "the direct products denote convolutions in the fractional parton momenta . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ e : gen_xs ] ) gives rise to a leading non - vanishing contribution to the double spin asymmetry @xmath0 .",
    "the lowest - order contributions to @xmath25 are found from the born diagrams for the partonic process ( see figs.@xmath26[f : diagrams ] ( a1 ) , ( b1 ) ) , plus @xmath27 corrections in which an extra gluon is exchanged between the remnants of the transversely polarized nucleon and the hard partonic scattering process ( see figs.@xmath26[f : diagrams ] ( a2 ) , ( b2 ) ) . in order to isolate the twist-3 contributions to the born diagrams at this order",
    ", we employ a collinear expansion in the parton momenta .     and",
    "@xmath28 . diagrams ( a1 ) and ( b1 ) contribute to the hard part associated with the soft part @xmath29 ; diagrams ( a2 ) and ( b2 ) contribute to the hard part associated with the soft part @xmath30.__,width=453 ]    to proceed further , let us briefly review the relevant twist-3 correlation functions involved in our calculation . for the @xmath0 asymmetry we consider twist-3 correlators in the transversely polarized nucleon , together with ordinary twist-2 helicity distributions @xmath31 in the longitudinally polarized nucleon . the so - called d - type ( twist-3 ) quark - gluon - quark functions ( here denoted by @xmath32 and @xmath33 )",

    "note that our definition of these functions differs by a factor @xmath46 from the conventions used in ref .",
    "it was found that the f - type functions directly enter the qcd - description of transverse ssas in various processes  @xcite .",
    "the d - type functions and the f - type functions are not independent as they can be related to each other by means of the equation of motion  @xcite , @xmath47 where @xmath35 indicates the principal value prescription , and the function @xmath48 is given by  @xcite @xmath49_{\\alpha\\beta } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because of the relations in eqs .",
    "( [ e : df_1 ] ) , ( [ e : df_2 ] ) we may either use the d - type or the f - type functions for our calculation .",
    "however , it is mandatory to also include @xmath48 in order to completely describe the spin - dependent cross section .",
    "( see also  @xcite and references therein for a discussion about independent twist-3 correlation functions . )",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that the function @xmath48 is related to the twist-2 tmd @xmath50 describing the distribution of longitudinally polarized quarks in a transversely polarized nucleon  @xcite , @xmath51 where we used the definition of @xmath50 as given in  @xcite .    as mentioned above , the twist expansion is the key step in our calculations .",
    "the relevant technical ingredients required for such a twist-3 analysis have been well developed in the last few decades  @xcite . in the twist expansion",
    ", a set of non - perturbative matrix elements of the hadron state is analyzed according to the power counting of the associated contributions . at the twist-3 level",
    ", the following matrix elements can contribute  @xcite : @xmath52 we found it most convenient to work in the light - cone gauge ( @xmath53 ) in which only the first two matrix elements survive .",
    "the matrix element @xmath29 can be transformed into the gauge invariant matrix element @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , by partial integration , the matrix element @xmath30 can be expressed as @xmath54 and further be related to the gauge invariant matrix elements @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "these functions may then be rewritten in terms of the d - type functions by means of eqs .",
    "( [ e : df_1 ] ) , ( [ e : df_2 ] ) .",
    "our goal is to perturbatively calculate the hard scattering coefficients associated with these two soft parts .",
    "the corresponding partonic scattering processes are illustrated in fig.@xmath26[f : diagrams ] .",
    "it turns out that the hard parts are not always real .",
    "imaginary contributions occur whenever an internal parton line in the hard scattering goes on - shell .",
    "when this happens , we use the distribution identity @xmath55 while for the related calculations of transverse ssas only the @xmath56-function contribution matters , in this calculation for @xmath0 we are left with the principal value part . to be more precise",
    ", the imaginary parts always cancel between the different cut diagrams . in order to combine corresponding cut diagrams we use the symmetry properties @xmath57 of the f - type functions and the d - type functions .",

    "can be combined into the same compact form that was found for the ssas for direct photon production and inclusive pion production  @xcite .",
    "we also point out that , unlike related previous studies of other processes  @xcite , the coefficient functions for @xmath32 and for @xmath33 are different . therefore , in the present case it does not pay off to involve @xmath4 in the final result .",
    "this also means that through direct photon production , in combination with other reactions , one should in principle be able to study a compete set of twist-3 correlators for a transversely polarized nucleon .",
    "by using collinear twist-3 factorization we derived the longitudinal - transverse double spin asymmetry @xmath0 for direct photon production in nucleon - nucleon scattering .",
    "our study can be considered as the counterpart of the calculation of the transverse ssa in the same process  @xcite . measuring this observable",
    "might also open a new window to test the higher - twist approach , for instance by looking at the transverse momentum behavior of @xmath0 .",
    "also , due to the derivative term of the correlator @xmath48 , the asymmetry may be largest in the large @xmath68 region  the same kinematics for which the largest ssas in hadron production have been observed .",
    "moreover , if the gluon helicity distribution ( in the small @xmath19 region ) is very small ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , one can expect @xmath0 to be larger for @xmath69 scattering than for @xmath70-scattering .",
    "the result for @xmath0 depends on a complete set of collinear twist-3 parton correlators for a transversely polarized nucleon .",
    "it requires numerical studies to find out to what extent these correlators could , at least in principle , be separately explored by variation of the kinematics .",
    "most likely one would need the combined information from different processes to address all three twist-3 correlation functions . besides the twist-3 effect investigated in this paper , a collinear twist-3 correlator for the longitudinally polarized hadron , coupling to the transversity distribution , may also contribute to @xmath0 .",
