    "most important to our work on stability of critical points is the work of serfaty in @xcite on ginzburg - landau in simply connected planar domains .",

    "ginzburg - landau posed on a @xmath0-manifold , baraket generalizes the work of @xcite to identify the renormalized energy on compact @xmath0-manifolds without boundary in @xcite .",
    "we should perhaps note that for ginzburg - landau in @xmath19-dimensional domains , there do exist stable vortex solutions ( @xcite ) .",
    "this analysis will be presented in section 2 .",
    "the second setting we consider is the heat flow for the ginzburg - landau energy , with @xmath20 , on surfaces of revolution @xmath18 with boundary : @xmath21 here @xmath22@xmath23 , and @xmath24 is any constant unit vector .",
    "we allow the compatible initial data @xmath25 to have any number of vortices though necessarily the total degree @xmath26 in light of the dirichlet condition .",
    "we want to find conditions on @xmath2 such that as @xmath27 , all vortices are annihilated .",
    "when @xmath28 , it has been shown in @xcite that if @xmath25 is close to @xmath24 at infinity in some sense , all vortices of @xmath29 disappear after a finite time .",
    "as in @xcite , we will derive a pohozaev - type inequality on surfaces ( lemma [ pohozaev ] ) to prove a similar result when @xmath2 is a simply connected surface of revolution satisfying an extra geometric assumption that is unrelated to curvature , see theorem [ koshin ] .",
    "this work is presented in section 3 .",
    "in this section we take @xmath2 to be a simply connected compact surface without boundary , and @xmath3 be a metric on @xmath2 . consider the ginzburg - landay energy on @xmath2 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",

    "this result has been generalized to a compact manifold @xmath2 without boundary , cf .",

    ".    we will refer to these points @xmath42 as limiting vortices associates with the sequence @xmath39.the same result holds on a compact manifold with modifications , see proposition 5.5 in @xcite .    from the uniformization theorem",
    ", there is a conformal map @xmath49@xmath50 , so that the metric @xmath3 is given by @xmath51 for some smooth function @xmath52 .",
    "we recall that @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the gauss curvature on @xmath2 .",
    "then for @xmath55 , transforms to @xmath56 we may assume that @xmath57 for all @xmath58 and denote @xmath59 . with a slight abuse of terminology , we will also call the @xmath60 s limiting vortices .",
    "then @xmath34 is the harmonic map associated to @xmath61 : @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is a smooth harmonic function .",
    "we also note that the notion of convergence linking @xmath39 to @xmath9 is that of convergence of the sequence of jacobians , namely @xmath66 in the sense of distributions , where @xmath67 denotes the scalar product in @xmath68 . for euclidean domains ,",
    "the proof of this convergence of jacobians can be found in @xcite and the adaptation to the manifold setting is immediate .",
    "moreover , the renormalized energy can be defined in the following way :    given @xmath69 , let @xmath70 be the geodesic ball in @xmath2 centered at @xmath71 with radius @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "consider @xmath74 which satisfies @xmath75 to see the existence of such a solution @xmath74 , we first consider a functional @xmath76 defined for @xmath77 such that @xmath78 for each @xmath58 .",

    "finally , using the fact that @xmath84 for @xmath85 when @xmath86 , theorem 2.1 in @xcite establishes that @xmath11 can be written as @xmath87    our first main result is the following :    [ main ] let @xmath88 be a family of solutions to such that @xmath89 , and let @xmath69 be the limiting vortices for @xmath39 .",
    "suppose there exists an @xmath71 such that the gauss curvature @xmath54 is positive at @xmath71 .",
    "then for @xmath15 small enough , @xmath32 is unstable .",
    "theorem [ main ] implies that if @xmath2 has positive curvature everywhere , then there is no stable solution to having vortices for @xmath15 small enough .",
    "moreover , in this case any solution without any vortices must then be a constant ( see lemma 3.2 in the next section ) .",
    "for the special case where @xmath90 , this instability result was first obtained by contreras , @xcite    if one wants to look for an example of a stable nonconstant critical point , one might consider a surface of revolution @xmath91 obtained by rotating a smooth curve @xmath92 about the @xmath93-axis shown in figure 1 , so that the shape of @xmath91 is like an apple .",
    "indeed , one can easily construct a critical point with vortices at @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( cf .",

    "that is , using the same notation as above we shall prove    let @xmath32 be a family of critical points of @xmath1 such that @xmath119 , and @xmath120 be limiting vortices with total degree zero .",

    "since @xmath136 is compactly supported , the domain of integration reduces from @xmath118 to a compact set .",
    "consequently , the result of product - estimate derived in @xcite used in the original proof can be also applied in our case .",
    "therefore we proceed to verify .    by the change of variables @xmath150 , we have @xmath151    noting that @xmath152 is the identity map in @xmath153 and a translation along a constant vector @xmath154 in each @xmath155 , we deduce that in @xmath153 and @xmath156 , @xmath157    * -derivative of the potential term : *    from , we derive @xmath158 since @xmath159 and @xmath160 are bounded in @xmath161 , one can apply lemma 3.2 in @xcite which asserts that @xmath162 converges to a measure supported on @xmath163 .",

    "next , define @xmath174 by @xmath175 from lemma 2.2 in @xcite and elliptic estimates , we have @xmath176 then by the definition of @xmath11 , we obtain @xmath177 hence the desired result .",

    "let @xmath182 be an arbitrary vector in @xmath118 .",
