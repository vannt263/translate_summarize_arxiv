    "the determination of photospheric parameters of very hot central stars with effective temperatures around = 100000k is most comprehensively achieved from quantitative nlte model atmosphere analyses of optical _ and _ ultraviolet spectra . in particular , abundances of most metals can only be found from uv observations because the strongest spectral lines from the highly ionised species are located in this wavelength band .",
    "temperature determinations from optical spectra alone suffer from the absence of neutral helium lines , preventing the use of the hei / heii ionisation balance , which is a common tool applied to cooler central stars .",
    "in addition , the balmer line problem at these high temperatures is still unsolved , i.e. , models still can not achieve a fit to all balmer lines of a particular object at a unique value for .",
    "however , metal lines from different ionisation stages are often detectable in uv spectra , allowing precise constraints on .",
    "in this contribution we report on our progress in this field since our review presented on the last iau planetary nebulae symposium @xcite .",
    "we first present new results for hydrogen - rich central stars and then turn to the hydrogen - deficient pg1159 stars .",
    "these two groups represent separate post - agb evolutionary channels , the first representing canonical post - agb evolutionary theory , and the second probably being the outcome of a late helium - shell flash .",
    "pg1159 stars are thought to be the progeny of wolf - rayet type central stars ( [ wc ] ) , which are dealt with in the contribution by @xcite in these proceedings .",
    "as described in detail by @xcite , we have taken high - resolution uv spectra of eight very hot central stars with the stis spectrograph aboard hst : ngc1360 , ngc1535 , ngc4361 , ngc6853 , ngc7293 , abell  36 , lss1362 , and lsv@xmath04621 . from this sample",
    ", ngc1535 clearly stands out because of very strong p  cygni line profiles .",
    "it was subject to a separate study because , in contrast to the other objects , expanding model atmospheres have to be used for its analysis .",
    "the results were presented by @xcite .",
    "in essence , temperature , gravity , and wind parameters determined by previous analyses were confirmed and a contemporary analysis performed by @xcite with a different model code arrives at similar results .    from the other objects in our sample we performed a nlte analysis with our tmap code which computes",
    "line blanketed models in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we determined temperatures and gravities as well as abundances of the cno elements .",
    "when available , we have also utilized new far - uv spectra taken with fuse and optical spectra taken at different observatories ( calar alto 3.5 m , siding spring 2.3 m , hobby - eberly telescope 9.2 m ) .",
    "more details were presented by @xcite and @xcite . as an example for the fit procedure we display in fig.[fig_ngc7293_hst ] details from the hst uv spectrum of ngc7293 , showing lines from oxygen in three ionisation stages compared to models with different .",
    "it shows that temperatures can be fixed with an accuracy of the order of 5% .",
    "our new , still preliminary results for and  as compared to previous , mostly optical , analyses , can be summarized as follows .",
    "all objects , except ngc1360 , are hotter than before , roughly by 1000015000k .",
    "the most extreme case is ngc4361 , whose `` increased '' from 82000k to 126000k .",
    "we also correct for the gravities , on the average by 0.3  dex , in either direction depending from star to star . by comparison with theoretical evolutionary tracks we derived stellar masses .",
    "they range between 0.55 and 0.65  m@xmath1 and the mean mass is 0.60  m@xmath1 , in agreement with the mean mass of white dwarfs .",
    "we find essentially solar abundances for the cno elements in 5 of the 7 stars .",
    "this points at ineffective or even lacking 2nd and 3rd dredge - up events in the preceding rg and agb phases , which can be explained by the relatively low mass of the stars in our sample .",
    "according to the initial - final - mass relation of @xcite , our most massive post - agb remnant ( 0.65  m@xmath1 ) had a main - sequence mass of 3  m@xmath1 .",
    "two objects definitely show non - solar abundance patterns .",
    "the first is lsv@xmath04621 ( sh2 - 216 ) .",
    "it was previously known that this is a white dwarf central star with a helium - deficiency ( 0.1 solar ) explained by gravitational settling @xcite .",
    "we find = 93000k and = 6.9 and , in line with the he - deficiency , a depletion of cno elements between 12  dex .",
    "the second case is ngc4361 .",
    "it was realized that this is a halo - pn @xcite so we expected to find subsolar metal abundances .",
    "indeed , it is obvious already on first sight , that the iron lines are much weaker than in the other central stars and we find that n is subsolar by 1  dex .",
    "however , o is found to be solar and , even more surprising , the abundance of c is 20 times solar .",
    "this abundance pattern is similar to that found for another pop.ii object , namely k648 , the central star of the planetary nebula ps1 in the globular cluster m15 @xcite .",
    "it seems possible that carbon is enriched by @xmath2c dredged up from the stellar c / o core .",
    "our analysis of iron - group lines in the hst and fuse spectra is still on - going @xcite .",
    "we often see iron lines of two ionisation stages in one object .",
    "this will serve as an additional check for  and we will determine abundances of these heavy metals .",
    "it now seems well established that the h - deficient central stars of spectral type [ wc ] and pg1159 form an evolutionary sequence , although there still exists an embarrassing systematic difference in the he / c ratios between early and late type [ wc ] stars @xcite .",
    "there is mounting evidence that the surface composition of [ wc ] and pg1159 stars is identical to that of the intershell matter in the progenitor agb stars .",
    "the observed relative abundances of he , c , and o are consistent with this picture .",
    "it is further confirmed by the iron - deficiency found in a number of [ wc ] and pg1159 stars @xcite which can be explained by neutron captures of iron in the @xmath3c pocket where s - processing occurs . to us",
    "it seems most likely that the h - deficiency of these stars is the result of a late he - shell flash which caused ingestion and burning of the h - rich envelope @xcite .",
    "but in this case one would expect to observe systematic differences in the nebula properties of h - rich and h - deficient central stars which , however , are not evident @xcite .",
    "another problem with the late he - shell flash scenario is the simultaneous occurrence of c- and o - rich circumstellar dust about [ wc ] central stars , which is difficult to understand .",
    "an alternative scenario to explain the origin of [ wc ] stars with this double - dust chemistry is a merging event of the agb progenitor with a planet or low - mass star , causing extra envelope mixing @xcite .    whatever the cause of hydrogen - envelope mixing is ( late helium - shell flash or merging event )",
    ", results of new spectral analyses further corroborate the picture that such mixing results in the exposure of intershell matter on the surface .",
    "these are the detection of a high abundances of neon in fluorine in a large number of pg1159 stars .    for a few of the brightest pg1159 stars a neon abundance of 2% ( by mass )",
    "could be derived from the nevii  3644    line @xcite .",
    "we have extended these analyses to fainter objects using one of the vlt 8 m telescopes @xcite .",
    "in addition , we identified a hitherto unknown strong neon line in fuse spectra , nevii  973   , which allows to determine the neon abundance in pg1159 stars in a wider -  range than before .",
    "we also identified a new nevii multiplet in the optical wavelength range ( 38503910   ) . in all cases we find ne=2% , in full agreement with the neon intershell abundance in agb stars @xcite . in the upper left panel of fig.[fig_neon_fluorine ]",
    "we show as an example the nevii  973  line in the fuse spectrum of the pg1159-type central star pg1520 + 525 .",
    "the line is so strong that it is still easily seen in hydrogen - rich central stars with a solar neon abundance level , which is 20 times lower .",
    "this is presented in the lower left panel of fig.[fig_neon_fluorine ] which displays the fuse spectrum of ngc1360 . in early [ wc ] stars and in the most luminous pg1159 stars",
    "this neon line exhibits a strong p  cygni profile .",
    "formerly this line has been erroneously interpreted as the ciii  977    resonance line but it could not be matched by models because they showed too weak profiles due to high ionisation @xcite .",
    "fuse spectroscopy also allowed for the first time to identify fluorine in post - agb stars @xcite . in the right panels of fig.[fig_neon_fluorine ] we show the identification of the fvi  1139.5    line in the two central stars just discussed .",
    "we find a solar f abundance in all five analysed h - rich central stars but a wide abundance spread in the eight pg1159 stars : from solar up to 250 times solar .",
    "the f enrichment can be explained by efficient f production in the intershell of agb stars , being in quantitative agreement with nucleosynthesis calculations @xcite .",
    "the f production efficiency is strongly mass - dependent and this might be the reason for the large abundance spread observed .    we have continued to investigate the iron - deficiency in pg1159 stars .",
    "we planned to obtain high - resolution hst / stis spectra of the prototype pg1159 + 035 and the central stars of ngc7094 and abell  78 to possibly detect a nickel enrichment caused by the transformation of iron to nickel during the s - process .",
    "the observing programme was performed , except for the abell78 observation because of the fatal stis failure in 2004 .",
    "the spectra are still being analyzed .",
    "as an example of the quality of these spectra , we display in fig.[fig_pg1159_hst ] the ov  1371    line profile for pg1159 - 035 ; this illustrates that we can fix  on a few - percent accuracy level .",
    "we will also work on other trace elements in pg1159 stars to see if their abundances are compatible with stellar evolution models .",
    "in this respect , the fuse spectra are , again , a rich source of information .",
    "for instance , in fig.[fig_phosphorus ] we display a detail from the spectrum of pg1424 + 535 , a relatively cool and high - gravity pg1159 star ( = 110000k , = 7 ) .",
    "it is located on the wd cooling sequence and its nebula has probably long being dispersed .",
    "we identify lines from silicon , sulfur , and phosphorus ; however , their abundances still remain to be determined @xcite .    as a final remark ,",
    "we note that the high - resolution spectroscopy performed with the hot central stars reveals problems with the available atomic data .",
    "many of the ovi lines and the newly identified optical nevii multiplet appear at wavelength positions clearly deviating from atomic line lists . in a positive sense",
    ", these spectra can be used to improve our knowledge about the term structure of highly ionised metals . on the other hand , many lines detected in the uv spectra remain unidentified even today ."
