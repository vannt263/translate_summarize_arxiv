    "the neutrino capture on free nucleons affects the @xmath0-process by changing @xmath8  so called the `` @xmath21 effect '' .",
    "as the temperature decreases to @xmath62 , @xmath21 particles form by assembling from free neutrons and protons , while the number ratio of free neutrons to free protons is locked by neutrino capture on free nucleons in the intense neutrino flux . as a result",

    "this plays , however , only a minor ( but non - negligible ) role in the `` realistic '' neutrino winds .",
    "for example , the increase of @xmath8 (= 0.40 , initially ) from @xmath64 to 2.5 ( at the onset of @xmath0-process ) is no more than 0.03 for the winds in model  c (   2.1.1 ) .",
    "note that this effect is of importance only at later phase ( @xmath65  erg  s@xmath41 ) , where the longer dynamic timescale as well as the shorter distance from the neutrino sphere at @xmath62 results in relatively larger neutrino fluence regardless of the lower @xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "neutrino spallation reactions on @xmath66he may also affect the nucleosynthesis because of the large abundance of @xmath21 particles in the high - entropy wind @xcite .",

    "3b - c and in many other `` successful '' @xmath0-process calculations , one worrisome aspect of the neutrino wind scenario is a large overproduction of @xmath74 ( closed neutron shell , @xmath75 ) nuclei synthesized through @xmath21-process by a factor of @xmath76 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "this originates from the moderately high entropy ( @xmath77 ) ejecta with a large @xmath34 before the @xmath0-process epoch ( @xmath78  erg  s@xmath41 ) ( fig .  2 ) .",

    "as can be seen , no overproduction of the @xmath97 nuclei appears in this abundance curve for both @xmath42 and @xmath98 cases .",
    "in fact , the harmful overproduction at @xmath74 is now replaced with the appropriate production of the @xmath84-nuclei @xmath88mo @xcite .",
    "this is due to the dominance of the matter with @xmath99 at the early phase of neutrino winds assumed here .",
    "however , the amount of the @xmath0-processed material seen in fig .",
    "5 is about one order smaller ( and the third peak abundances are also deficient in this case ) than that in figure  3c , since the @xmath0-process does not take place when @xmath33 is high ( and thus @xmath34 is large ) as in   2.1 , owing to the high @xmath8 at the early phase . given the neutrino wind is the major production site of the @xmath0-process nuclei , therefore , it is not evident if merely the proton richness in the neutrino - heated ejecta at the early phase solves the overproduction problem .",
    "a most probable implication is that the neutrino winds from a _ typical _ proto - ns ( e.g. , @xmath42 and @xmath43  km ) are responsible for the production of _ only _ light @xmath0-process nuclei such as sr , y , and zr , and no heavier than the second peak ( @xmath52 ) as can be seen in fig .",

    "this is still of importance , however , since there are increasing evidences that at least two different astrophysical sites exist for the origins of `` light '' and `` heavy '' @xmath0-process nuclei ( see   3.3 ) . nevertheless , a possibility of the production of species beyond the second ( @xmath52 ) and third ( @xmath53 ) peaks with a very _ compact _ proto - ns ( e.g , @xmath101 km as for models  b and c in figs .  2 and 3 )",
    "can not be ruled out .",
    "in fact , many eoss meet this condition , @xmath102 km , near their maximum masses ( @xmath103 , see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent measurements of ns masses in binary systems also support the presence of such massive nss @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that a proto - ns s mass could be slightly larger than the maximum mass of a cold star because of its extra leptons and thermal energy . in this case ,",
    "collapse to a black hole would take place ( after the @xmath0-process ) on a diffusion time of a few 10  s , which might have occured in sn  1987a @xcite .    if the neutrino winds were _",
    "really _ the major production site of the heavy @xmath0-process nuclei , therefore , the progenitor would have a relatively large mass , e.g. , @xmath104 . on the other hand",
    ", the lighter @xmath0-process nuclei would be supplied from low mass progenitors ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "this difference may reflect the change of a core structure with the progenitor mass , i.e. , the steep density gradient with the small iron core ( @xmath106 ) for a star of @xmath107 and the mild density gradient with the massive iron core ( @xmath108 ) for a star of @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the very massive progenitors would suffer from a significant `` fallback '' of the matter once ejected , resulting in , perhaps , no ejection of @xmath0-processed material @xcite .",
    "hence , the progenitors for the origin of the heavy @xmath0-process nuclei may be limited to a small mass range , e.g. , @xmath109 .",
    "this would make such an event relatively rare , accounting only about @xmath110 of all core - collapse sn events .",
    "this ( moderate ) rareness does not cause a problem , but rather is needed from galactic chemical evolution as discussed in   3.2 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the implications above are all based on the assumption of spherical symmetry as well as on the arbitrary chosen @xmath8 .",
    "there have been no qualitative studies of @xmath0-process in asymmetric neutrino winds nor with an accurate determination of @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , conclusions described here might be modified by the future works based on more _ realistic _ modelings of neutrino winds with multidimensional hydrodynamics as well as with an accurate treatment of neutrino transport .",
    "it is interesting to note that recent two - dimensional simulations demonstrate that hydrodynamic instabilities can lead to low - mode ( @xmath111 ) asymmetries of the fluid flow in the neutrino - heated layer behind the sn shock @xcite .",
    "this provides not only a natural explanation for aspherical mass ejection and for pulsar kicks but shows some promise as the yet unknown explosion mechanism of core - collapse sne @xcite .",
    "such multi - dimensional effects may have to be taken into account in the future work , since the @xmath0-process takes place relatively close to the core ( @xmath112  km ) where the asymmetry plays a significant role . the strong magnetic field",
    "( `` magneter - like '' strength such as @xmath113  g , three orders of magnitude larger than the typical value ) in a proto - ns has been also suggested to increase entropy and thus help the @xmath0-process even with @xmath114 @xcite ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "such sn events account for no more than a few % of all sn events .",
    "this might be , however , still in reasonable agreement with the constraint from galactic chemical evolution (   3.2 ) .",
    "if a massive star explodes hydrodynamically at core bounce prior to the delayed neutrino heating , the ejecta keeps its neutron richness due to electron capture , @xmath115 , which may lead naturally to @xmath0-processing regardless of the relatively low entropy , @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "this is one of the reasons that this scenario , `` prompt explosion '' has been still considered to be a possible explanation for the @xmath0-process origin , despite difficulties in achieving such an explosion by self - consistent hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "in fact , many previous works have suggested that even the sne near their lower - mass end ( @xmath117 ) , which form small iron cores ( @xmath106 ) , have difficulties in achieving hydrodynamic explosions .",

    "one of the most remarkable findings related to the spectroscopic studies of galactic halo stars in the last decade is the discovery of several extremely metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] \\equiv \\log ( n_a / n_b ) - \\log ( n_a / n_b)_\\odot$ ] , where @xmath162 indicates abundance of @xmath163 . ] @xmath164 ) , @xmath0-process - enhanced ( [ eu / fe]-process elements , since @xmath165 of its solar abundance originates from @xmath0-process @xcite . ] @xmath166 ) stars , whose abundances of neutron - capture elements are in excellent agreement with the scaled solar @xmath0-process curve . as can be seen in fig .",
    "11 , the neutron - capture element abundances in cs  22892 - 052 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath167 and [ eu / fe ] @xmath168 ) @xcite show an outstanding concordance with the scaled solar @xmath0-process abundance curve , in particular between the second and third @xmath0-process peaks ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "the appearance of _ purely _ @xmath0-processed matter - process - enhanced , extremely metal - poor _ carbon _ stars are not considered here , whose atmosphere might have been polluted from the former agb companions in binaries @xcite . ] in the atmosphere of such old halo stars in the galaxy strongly support the idea that the production of @xmath0-process nuclei is associated to short - lived massive stars , perhaps , core - collapse sne @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the uniqueness of the abundance patterns of neutron - capture elements demonstrates the _ universality _ of the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis that occurs in , perhaps , a unique astrophysical site .",

    "another notable discovery is the detection of uranium in cs  31082 - 001 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath170 and [ eu / fe ] @xmath171 ) @xcite , which can be regarded as a precise cosmochronometer in addition to th previously used for age dating @xcite (   3.4 ) . on the other hand , however , the significantly high th and u ( and low pb ) abundances compared to those in cs  22892 - 052 clearly show that the universality does _ not _ hold beyond the third @xmath0-process ( pt ) peak , which makes the age dating assuming the `` universality '' of the @xmath0-process abundance pattern questionable .",
    "this _ non - universality _ of the @xmath0-process beyond the pt - peak has been further confirmed by additional findings of th - rich stars @xcite .",
    "it is not clear from currently available data that the _ universality _ holds down to the elements near the first @xmath0-process peak , e.g. , sr , y , and zr , owing to the deficiencies of a few elements between the first and second @xmath0-process peaks , as can be seen in figs .",

    "another striking feature of the observed neutron - capture element abundances in extremely metal - poor stars is their large dispersions that can not be seen in any other elements @xcite . in fig .",
    "13 , the observed eu abundances ( as representative of heavy @xmath0-process elements ) relative to iron taken from the recent literature are plotted .",
    "the dispersion for the measured values ranges about two orders of magnitude at [ fe / h ] @xmath172 , which is in contrast to the exceedingly small scatters for @xmath21 and iron - peak elements @xcite .",

    "13a ) , the predicted area in which stars are detected ( shown by the grey image ) is small and close to the average stellar abundance ( thick - solid line ) and the ism value ( thick - dotted line ) .",
    "most of the observed stars distribute out of its 90% confidence interval ( thin - solid line ) .",

    "in fact , this is rather similar to the observed abundances of @xmath21 elements with exceedingly small dispersion ( e.g. , mg ) , which have only mild dependence of the yields on the progenitor mass .",
    "in contrast , large dispersions are predicted for cases  b - d .",
    "this is explained as follows .",
    "the star formed by the sn that undergoes @xmath0-process inherits the large amount of eu .",
    "this results in the higher [ eu / fe ] than the ism value . on the other hand",
    ", the star formed by the sn without @xmath0-process but with fe ejecta has the [ eu / fe ] value below the ism line . as a result , a large dispersion of the [ eu / fe ] values appears .",

    "13a - d clearly demonstrate that the limited mass range ( @xmath188 of all sn events ) of the progenitor stars that undergo the @xmath0-process naturally explain the observed large star - to - star scatters of the @xmath0-process elements relative to iron . in addition , a small ( or no ) iron production strengthens the dispersion owing to the appearance of stars with high [ eu / fe ] values , which can be seen in case  b. a significant difference among these three cases appears , however , in the areas with the sub - solar [ eu / fe ] ( @xmath189 ) values near [ fe / h ] @xmath190 .",
    "stars with low [ eu / fe ] values must appear if the @xmath0-process elements originate from sne near their lower - mass end ( fig .",
    "13b ) owing to their delayed appearances , as also predicted by an earlier work @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "few stars are expected to appear in this region for case  d , since the ism is initially enriched with the @xmath0-process elements by massive stars .",
    "case  c with the intermediate mass range of sne lies between cases  b and d. most of the observed stars , in particular when including those with the lowest [ eu / fe ] values at [ fe / h ] @xmath191 ( large double circles in fig .",

    "most of these stars distribute below the average line , but still within the 90% confidence interval ( fig .",
    "13c ) . for case  d ,",
    "many observed stars are out of the 90% confidence interval .",
    "this might support the sne near their lower - mass end , e.g. , collapsing o - ne - mg cores from @xmath118 stars (   2.2 ) , as the astrophysical @xmath0-process site , although its explosion mechanism ( i.e. , `` prompt '' or `` delayed '' ) can not be constrained .",
    "the little production of @xmath21 and iron - peak elements in this site @xcite is also consistent with the observed small scatters of these elements in extremely metal - poor stars @xcite , by adding only @xmath0-process elements to the formed star .",
    "it should be noted that the slightly shifted mass range , e.g. , @xmath192 , which corresponds to the sne from collapsing _ iron _ cores near their low - mass end with the relatively small ejection of @xmath21 and iron - peak elements , would result in a similar outcome .",
    "the sne from more massive progenitors , e.g. , @xmath177 ( case  c ) , as proposed to be a possible case in the neutrino wind scenario (   2.1.4 ) , can not be excluded either , with the current limited number of stars having the measured eu values .",
    "further detections of eu in the stars at [ fe / h ] @xmath193 without any selection biases , are highly desired . on the other hand , the sne near their high mass end , which may include `` pair - instability sne '' or `` collapsars '' , are less likely to be the origin of heavy @xmath0-process nuclei .",
    "it is interesting to note that the large @xmath0-processed material per event owing to the limited mass range would increase the chance of direct detection of @xmath0-process elements in nearby sn remnants by future observations .",
    "in particular , detection of gamma - ray emission from the decay of @xmath0-process nuclei would prove that the sne with certain masses are the @xmath0-process site @xcite .",
    "it should be cautioned that the ism is assumed to be _ homogeneous _ in the current models , which must be _ inhomogeneous _ to some extent at the early galactic history .",
    "the chemical evolution study with a fully inhomogeneous ism model shows that the stars with low [ eu / fe ] values ( such as in fig .",
    "13b ) always appear as far as the sne that undergo @xmath0-processing are restricted to a certain progenitor mass range , even if the range is assumed to the high - mass end ( @xmath194 , see fig .  3 in * ? ? ?",
    ". on the other hand , such a model results in large star - to - star scatters of other elements , e.g. , [ @xmath21/fe ] @xcite , which conflicts with the recent spectroscopic studies of extremely metal - poor stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this might imply that the ism at the early galaxy was efficiently mixed ( i.e. , close to the homogeneous ism ) , as far as in the region where stars formed .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as more measurements of neutron - capture elements in stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath193 , will be needed before drawing any firm conclusions .",
    "if `` ns mergers '' instead of sne were taken as the major @xmath0-process site in the current chemical evolution model , the result would be in disagreement with the observed stellar abundances , as examined in a recent work @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the expected small event rate @xmath195  yr@xmath41 @xcite ( i.e. , the large @xmath0-process amount per event to be the dominant @xmath0-process origin ) with the long period needed for a coalescence results in an extremely large scatter of [ eu / fe ] as well as a significant delay of its appearance . the same may hold for aics , whose event rate is estimated to be similar @xcite .",

    "15 shows the [ pd / ba ] values as a function of [ sr / ba ] for extremely metal - poor stars ( @xmath196 \\le -2.3 $ ] ) .",
    "note that for stars in this metallicity range , no @xmath1-process contribution to ba abundances are thought to occur , which is consistent with their mostly pure solar @xmath0-process ratios of ba / eu . the stellar sample is taken from the recent literature , along with the five stars ( large double circles ) obtained from our recent observations with subaru / hds @xcite . by definition ,",
    "the [ sr / ba ] value increases with the contribution of weak @xmath0-process to the stellar abundances , when compared to the solar @xmath0-process value ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "the [ pd / ba ] value would increase linearly with [ sr / ba ] ( with the slope of unity ) if the pd abundances were in proportion to those of sr . on the other hand ,",
    "[ pd / ba ] would show no increase if the pd abundances were in proportion to those of ba .",
    "the observed stars show a mild correlation with the slope less than unity , indicating pd originates from _ both _ the weak and main @xmath0-processes .",
    "the chemical evolution model described in   3.2 @xcite is used to determine the fractions of the weak r - process component to the _ total _",
    "( i.e. , both the weak and main @xmath0-processes ) production of sr , pd , and ba . here",
    ", the weak and main @xmath0-process sites are assumed to be the stars of @xmath118 and @xmath197 , respectively ( changes of these mass ranges do not affect the result qualitatively , see * ? ? ?",
    ". a reasonable fit to the observed stars can be obtained when the fractions of the weak @xmath0-process component to sr , pd , and ba are assumed to be 60% , 10% , and 1% , respectively ( fig .  15 ) .",
    "thus , the _ typical _ weak @xmath0-process may synthesize mainly lighter nuclei up to @xmath198 ( @xmath199 ) .",
    "however the number of the sr - rich stars with the measured pd abundances is so small ( two measured values and one hard upper limit ) that more observations will be needed before drawing the conclusion .",
    "this boundary mass estimated here is significantly smaller than @xmath200 that is suggested by the meteoritic analysis @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the main @xmath0-process may produce _ all _ the @xmath0-process nuclei with the solar @xmath0-process - like distribution but , perhaps , with slightly underabundant lighter nuclei when subtracting the weak @xmath0-process component . as can be seen in fig .",
    "15 , there is currently no observed star that shows strong excess of _ only _ heavy @xmath0-process elements with @xmath154 ( i.e. , with significantly low [ sr / ba ] and [ pd / ba ] values compared to the solar @xmath0-process ratios ) as suggested in previous studies @xcite .",
    "a few actinides such as @xmath201th and @xmath202u are regarded as potentially useful cosmochronometers because their long radioactive decay half - lives ( @xmath201th : 14.05  gyr ; @xmath202u : 4.468  gyr ) are significant fractions of the expected age of the universe .",
    "the excellent agreement of the relative abundances of neutron - capture elements in cs  22892 - 052 with the solar @xmath0-process pattern (   3.1 ) initially suggested that th might serve as a precise cosmochronometer @xcite .",
    "the time that has passed since the production of th observed now in the atmosphere of such an old halo star can be regarded as a hard lower limit on the age of the universe .",
    "one advantage of the actinide chronology is that , once the initial and current values of an actinide relative to an stable @xmath0-process element ( @xmath0 ) , e.g. , eu , in the star are specified , the age of the star depends only on the half - life of its actinide determined in the laboratory .",
    "that is , one is not forced to invoke complex models of galactic chemical evolution , which no doubt involve large uncertainties in themselves .",
    "the _ initial _ production ratio of th/@xmath0 has been usually determined by fitting theoretical nucleosynthesis results to the solar @xmath0-process pattern , with the assumption that the @xmath0-process pattern is _ universal _ over the actinide region in all astrophysical environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , there are an increasing number of evidences that the universality does not hold for actinides by the discoveries of th - rich halo stars @xcite whose th / eu values are higher than that of the solar @xmath0-process ratio",
    ". these _ old _ halo stars would be younger than the solar system if the initial th / eu were taken to be universal .",
    "theoretical studies of @xmath0-process calculations also support the _ non - universality _ of the @xmath0-process abundances beyond the pt - peak nuclei ( @xmath203 ) , as can be seen in fig .  8 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , any age estimates that demand the universality of the @xmath0-process pattern may in fact be unreliable .     in the prompt explosion model @xcite as described in   2.2 .",
    "the surface of the o - ne - mg core is at mass coordinate zero .",
    "ages of cs  31082 - 001 , @xmath204 ( filled squares ) and @xmath205 ( filled circles ) inferred by these ratios , are also shown . ]     in the prompt explosion model @xcite as described in   2.2 .",
    "the surface of the o - ne - mg core is at mass coordinate zero .",
    "ages of cs  31082 - 001 , @xmath204 ( filled squares ) and @xmath205 ( filled circles ) inferred by these ratios , are also shown . ]",
    "the discovery of the second highly @xmath0-process - enhanced halo star cs  31082 - 001 @xcite has provided a powerful new tool for age determination by virtue of the detection of uranium . because the half - life of @xmath202u is one - third that of @xmath201th , uranium can , in principle , provide a far more precise cosmochronometer than thoriumu may have mostly @xmath21 decayed away because of its relatively short half - life ( 0.704  gyr ) . ] .",
    "furthermore , we are able to determine the initial @xmath0-process abundance curve in a star with the constraint that the ages derived from _ both _ the ratios th/@xmath0 and u/@xmath0 ( or u / th ) provide the same value .",
    "this `` u - th cosmochronology '' that does not assume the universality of the @xmath0-process abundance pattern is a far more reliable age - dating technique than that with solely th-@xmath0 .",
    "16 shows the ages of cs  31082 - 001 derived from various chronometer pairs , comparing the abundances obtained from the spectroscopic analysis @xcite and the theoretical estimate @xcite based on the neutrino wind model ( @xmath60 and @xmath43  km ) as described in   2.1 . here",
    ", @xmath8 is taken to be a free parameter , which can be constrained to be @xmath206 so as the ages obtained from , e.g. , th / eu and u / th give the same value .",
    "17 shows the ages derived from the ratios th / eu and u / th based on the prompt explosion model of a collapsing o - ne - mg core as described in   2.2 , as functions of the ejecta mass @xmath145 .",
    "the free parameter here , @xmath145 , can be constrained to be @xmath207 or @xmath208 , where both ages from the ratios th / eu and u / th give the same value .",
    "interestingly , the ages of cs  31082 - 001 derived from the above two different astrophysical scenarios are the same ",
    "@xmath209  gyr ( the error only includes that arising from the observations ) .",
    "this demonstrates that chronometric estimates obtained using the u - th pair are mostly independent of the astrophysical conditions considered , since these species separated by only two units in atomic number .",
    "as far as the u - th pair is concerned , therefore , the ingredients of nuclear data @xcite as well as the estimated observational errors , rather than the @xmath0-process site , are crucial for the age determination .",
    "note that the replacement of the nuclear mass formula ( see   2.4 ) from dm applied here @xcite to frdm @xcite or the recent microscopic models ( hfb-2 and hfb-7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) results in only small changes in age of the star ( @xmath210  gyr )",
    ". the uncertainties in fission reactions may not affect the age significantly as far as the contribution of the fission fragment is not dominated in the final @xmath0-process abundances .",
    "it should be noted that there is a serious problem , that is , the measured pb abundance is substantially lower than the scaled solar value as can be seen in fig .",
    "12 @xcite and also than the theoretical estimates @xcite .",
    "improved observational determination of the u / th ratio in cs  31082 - 001 as well as the measurement of bi ( in addition to pb ) that is produced mainly by @xmath21-decay from actinides , and the identification of a greater number of highly @xmath0-process - enhanced , metal - poor stars , will be obviously needed before regarding the age - dating technique with the u - th pair considered here to be confident .",
    "the astrophysical @xmath0-process site is still unknown .",
    "recent theoretical works of @xmath0-process calculations suggest some scenarios , in particular the `` neutrino wind '' or the `` prompt explosion '' arising from the core collapses of massive stars , or the `` ns merger '' to be promising , although all these involve severe problems that remain to be solved .",
    "on the other hand , recent galactic chemical evolution studies as well as spectroscopic studies of extremely metal - poor halo stars imply the @xmath0-process origin to be the core - collapse sne from the restricted progenitor - mass range ( possibly near their lower - mass end ) .",
    "in addition , the presence of the `` weak '' @xmath0-process that produces only lighter @xmath0-process nuclei is suggested , while the `` main '' @xmath0-process may produce all @xmath0-process nuclei up to the actinides species .",
    "all these studies of @xmath0-process calculations and galactic chemical evolution in the last decade have shown remarkable progresses toward better understanding of the @xmath0-process , and the ongoing works will shed light on this long - standing mystery .",
