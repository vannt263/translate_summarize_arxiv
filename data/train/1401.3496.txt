    "the study of quasinormal modes has a long history@xcite .",
    "vishveshwara@xcite first presented the idea of quasinormal modes .",
    "chandrasekhar and detweller@xcite studied the quasinormal modes of schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the study of quasinormal modes started with black hole stability problem which concern the evolutions of black hole perturbations .",
    "the evolution of wave fields around a black hole consists of roughly three stages@xcite .",
    "the first is an initial wave burst coming directly from source and is dependent on the initial form of the original wave field .",
    "the second part involves damped oscillations called quasinormal frequencies , which is independent of the initial value of the wave but depends on the background black hole spacetime . because of radiation damping , the normal frequencies are complex .",
    "the last stage is the power law tail which arises because of back scattering of long range gravitational field@xcite .",
    "it is believed that the presence of black hole can be inferred using this quasinormal waves .",
    "thus recently the study of quasinormal modes becomes important as a number of gravitational wave detectors are expected to start operating soon .",
    "usually the quasinormal mode frequencies are damped complex frequencies and thus we must employ the numerical methods to evaluate them . unlike the case of gravitational , electromagnetic and scalar perturbations , the dirac field is more complicated to evaluate .",
    "the third order wkb method@xcite is utilized for computation of quasinormal modes in the present study .",
    "@xmath0 dimensional black holes are the simplest toy model of general @xmath1 black holes in general theory of relativity .",
    "one example of @xmath0 black holes is the btz black holes@xcite .",
    "the scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations can be analytically studied for such black holes@xcite , but it is difficult in the case of dirac field .",
    "such studies using wkb method are there in the literature .",
    "another type of @xmath0 black holes is charged dilaton black holes .",
    "quasi normal modes of charged dilaton black hole is studied@xcite .",
    "a special case of such black holes is the msw black holes .",
    "it is a one parameter family of chargeless black holes proposed by mandal et .",
    "previously we have studied the thermodynamics and spectroscopy of msw black hole@xcite    here in the present work we study the massless dirac quasinormal modes of msw black holes using wkb approximation . the paper is organized as follows in section .",
    "2 we introduce the msw black hole . in section .",
    "3 we discuss the dirac field in msw space - time background . in section .",
    "4 we evaluate the quasinormal modes and finally in section .",
    "5 give the conclusions .",
    "the metric for msw black hole is given by ( @xmath2 system of units ) @xmath3 where u(r ) is given by@xcite @xmath4 this metric has a zero at ( ie the horizon ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the cosmological constant , @xmath7 is a constant factor , @xmath8 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "]    in this section we consider the dirac field in msw background space - time . the dirac equation in a general background space - time",
    "can be written as@xcite @xmath9\\phi = m\\phi,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the mass of the dirac field , @xmath11 are the curvature dependent dirac matrices and are represented in terms of tetrad field as @xmath12 @xmath13 represent the standard flat space dirac matrices , which satisfy @xmath14 @xmath15 , the tetrad field is defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 being the minkowski metric .",

    "we can take the tetrad as @xmath23 the spin connection satisfy the equation @xmath24=\\frac{\\partial \\gamma^{\\nu}}{\\partial x^{\\mu}}+\\gamma^{\\nu}_{\\mu \\rho}\\gamma^{\\rho}.\\ ] ] we solve equation ( 10 ) for spin connection @xmath18 and is given by @xmath25 and hence @xmath26 becomes    ]    @xmath27.\\ ] ]    therefor the dirac equation becomes @xmath28+i\\frac{\\gamma_{3}}{r}\\partial_{\\phi}-m\\right]\\phi=0.\\ ] ] this equation can be transformed using tortoise coordinates to schrodiger like equations as , @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the tortoise coordinate , @xmath32 and",
    "@xmath33 are the two wave functions of the dirac equation .",
    "@xmath34 are given by    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is a function of @xmath37 related to the potential .",
    "the same set of equations repeat with @xmath38 changed to @xmath39 . putting together",
    "we get @xmath40 @xmath41 the effective potential can be derived from this as @xmath42 for our metric given by eq.(@xmath43 ) the potential can be written as @xmath44    the potential is plotted for different values of k is given in figure     fig.(3 ) shows the dependence of potential on the angular momentum quantum number k. it is of barrier form and the barrier increases in height as the k value increases .",
    "in order to evaluate the dirac quasinormal modes we use the wkb approximation method developed by schutz , will and iyer@xcite . comparing with other numerical methods this method has been found to be accurate up to around one percent for both real and imaginary parts .",
    "the equation for computing the quasinormal modes @xmath45 is given by , @xmath46-i(n+\\frac{1}{2})(-2v_{0}'')^{\\frac{1}{2}}(1+\\omega),\\ ] ] where @xmath47,\\ ] ] and @xmath48,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 , and @xmath50 substituting the potential @xmath51 obtained from ( eq.20 ) in eq.(21 ) we get the complex quasinormal modes for massless dirac field in msw space - time . the values are listed in tables and plotted .",
    "fig.(1 ) and fig.(2 ) represent the quasinormal mode frequencies for different values of @xmath7 .",
    "the figures show that the real part of complex frequencies slightly increase , while the magnitude of imaginary part of frequencies increases rapidly with mode number @xmath52 for the same value of @xmath37 .",
    "this indicates that the higher modes decay faster than the low lying modes .",
    "in this work we have studied the quasinormal modes of a chargeless @xmath0 black hole called msw black hole .",
    "the complex frequencies are found out and tabulated .",
    "graphs are plotted for various values of the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the modulus value of imaginary part of the frequencies increases with increasing mode number showing that the radiation is damping which in turn shows that the black hole is stable against massless dirac perturbations .",
    "real values of the frequencies increases in this case contradictory to the normal @xmath1 black holes .",
    "cho@xcite obtained the dirac quasinormal modes of schwarzschild black hole using wkb approximation method.they showed that the real part of quasinormal modes increases with angular momentum quantum number @xmath37 and for a particular @xmath37 , the real part of quasinormal modes decreases with increasing @xmath52 .",
    "jiliang@xcite got the quasinormal modes of schwarzschild black hole using continued fraction and hill - determinant methods and obtained an increasing real part . in both cases the imaginary part increases with mode number showing damping and thus black holes in @xmath1 dimensions are stable against dirac perturbation .",
    "this result agrees with the present work for @xmath0 black hole .",
