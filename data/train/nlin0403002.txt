    "incompressible fluid turbulence in two dimensions has always been a subject of interest because of its relative simplicity and broad applications in geophysical problems .",
    "although the theory of two - dimensional ( 2d ) turbulence is not strictly applicable to a geophysical fluid , the third ( vertical ) dimension in many geophysical systems can nevertheless be `` removed '' , and the resulting 2d equations are thought to be quantitatively adequate for describing the large - scale horizontal motion .",
    "some systems in this category , which receive considerable attention , are the surface quasi - geostrophic ( sqg ) equation , describing the motion of a rotating stratified fluid @xcite ; the `` rotating shallow flow '' ( rsf ) equation , governing the motion of a thin fluid on a rotating domain @xcite ; and the charney  hasegawa ",
    "mima equation , governing the potential vorticity of an equivalent - barotropic fluid @xcite . except possibly for the last equation",
    ", these systems , together with the more familiar 2d navier  stokes ( ns ) equations , can be studied within a unified framework by a family of models ( known as the @xmath0 turbulence equations ) indexed by a parameter @xmath4 @xcite . like the 2d ns system ,",
    "the nonlinear transfer of @xmath0 turbulence conserves two quadratic invariants : @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the streamfunction power spectrum , @xmath9 is a real number , and @xmath10 is the wavenumber .",
    "note that @xmath11 is the kinetic energy spectrum , and @xmath12 is the kinetic energy .",
    "the statistical dynamics of unbounded 2d ns turbulence are believed to achieve a quasi - steady state which simultaneously exhibits a direct enstrophy cascade to high wavenumbers and an inverse energy cascade to low wavenumbers . according to the classical theory formulated by kraichnan @xcite , leith @xcite , and batchelor @xcite ( hereafter referred to as klb ) , if the system is excited around a ( forcing ) wavenumber @xmath13 ,",
    "the dual cascade is supposed to carry virtually all of the energy input to ever - lower wavenumbers , down to wavenumber @xmath14 , and the enstrophy input to a high wavenumber @xmath15 , around which the enstrophy is dissipated .",
    "analyses based on kolmogorov s phenomenology predict that the energy spectrum scales respectively as @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the energy- and enstrophy - cascading ranges ( also known as inertial ranges ) .",
    "the klb theory , when applied to @xmath0 turbulence , implies the possibility that @xmath18 cascades to low wavenumbers and that @xmath19 cascades to high wavenumbers .",
    "these ( possible cascading ) invariants correspond to different physical quantities for different flows . for sqg turbulence , the direct - cascading candidate is the energy . for rsf turbulence ,",
    "the direct - cascading candidate is the palinstrophy . when @xmath20 , the enstrophy becomes the inverse - cascading candidate .",
    "ns turbulence features the energy and enstrophy as the possible inverse- and direct - cascading quantities , respectively .    despite numerical evidence confirming the realization of an inverse energy cascade and of the kolmogorov ",
    "kraichnan @xmath16 spectrum @xcite , the dual cascade remains conjectural .",
    "no convincing evidence exists of a direct enstrophy cascade .",
    "rather , there exist some negative results with respect to this problem . in particular , for a bounded system in equilibrium , a direct enstrophy cascade",
    "is excluded @xcite . for an unbounded system ,",
    "a direct enstrophy cascade is prohibited for all weak inverse energy cascades @xcite . by `` weak '' , it is understood that the inverse cascades do not carry virtually all of the energy input to the large scales .",
    "this behaviour is presumably the dynamical behaviour for finite - reynolds number turbulence .",
    "the questions then arise whether the inverse energy cascade can become `` strong '' in the limit of infinite reynolds number and whether a direct enstrophy cascade can then be realizable .",
    "this study generalizes various previous results for the 2d ns system @xcite to @xmath0 turbulence and re - examines the dual - cascade hypothesis under the general framework of the latter case .",
    "also , some new results on related issues , such as the non - conservative transfer of quadratic quantities other than the invariants , are reported .",
    "first , the derivations of some a priori estimates for the dissipation terms of the quadratic invariants are presented .",
    "second , the result of tran and shepherd @xcite is generalized to the present problem , showing that under the influence of a viscous operator , the invariants satisfy @xmath21 .",
    "third , the conservative transfer of the quadratic invariants and the non - conservative transfer of other quadratic quantities are examined .",
    "the former consideration is essentially a reformulation of the dual - cascade hypothesis .",
    "it is shown that even in the limit of infinite reynolds number , the inverse cascade of @xmath18 could become strong , carrying virtually all of the injection of @xmath18 to ever - larger scales , in the complete absence of a direct cascade of @xmath19 .",
    "this study does not attempt an alternative to the classical dual - cascade theory , but is concerned with the plausibility of the dual - cascade hypothesis .",
    "a constraint on the spectral slopes for fluids in equilibrium is obtained by extending the derivations of tran and bowman @xcite to the present case .",
    "finally , the results from numerical simulations of ns turbulence are presented , confirming the realization of an inverse energy cascade in the absence of a direct enstrophy cascade .",
    "these numerical results suggest that for high reynolds numbers , the turbulence would become non - direct - cascading by evolving through a transient direct - cascading stage .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the equation of motion governing @xmath0 turbulence and its conservation laws .",
    "section 3 presents the derivations of the upper bounds on the asymptotic averages of the dissipation of quadratic invariants and the dynamical constraint @xmath21 .",

    "section 6 presents a constraint on the spectral slopes of the kinetic energy spectrum for fluids in equilibrium .",
    "section 7 reports the results from numerical simulations of 2d ns turbulence , confirming the realization of a weak inverse energy cascade in the complete absence of a direct enstrophy cascade .",
    "the paper ends with some concluding remarks in the final section .",
    "the term `` @xmath0 turbulence '' refers to a general class of 2d incompressible fluid turbulence , in which the conserved scalar @xmath22 is advected in a velocity field with stream function @xmath23 . here , @xmath0 is a positive number , and @xmath24 is the 2d laplacian .",
    "the equation governing the fluid motion is @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the generalized viscosity coefficient , @xmath28 is the degree of viscosity , and @xmath29 is the forcing . the stream function @xmath30 is related to the fluid velocity @xmath31 by @xmath32 .",
    "this family includes the three physically realizable fluid systems , which are the focus of this work .",
    "the case @xmath1 corresponds to the sqg equation from the geophysical context , describing the motion of a stratified fluid with small rossby and ekman numbers @xcite .",
    "the familiar 2d ns system corresponds to @xmath2 .",
    "the case @xmath3 corresponds to the rsf system , governing a shallow flow on a rotating domain with uniform internal heating @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear term in ( [ governing ] ) obeys the conservation laws @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the spatial average . as a consequence , the two quadratic quantities @xmath35 and @xmath36 are conserved by nonlinear transfer .    in this study",

    "more restrictive conditions on @xmath29 and specific values of @xmath39 for the particular cases to be considered will be stated in due course .",
    "in particular , @xmath40 represents molecular viscosity as in the ns case .",
    "the sqg system has @xmath41 as the physical dissipation mechanism ; other values of @xmath39 have also been considered for numerical purposes in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is not well understood how the dynamics would depend on the degree of viscosity @xmath39 .",
    "nevertheless , there appears to be a belief that @xmath42 ( for large positive values of @xmath39 ) globally acts on the small scales , hence the name `` small - scale dissipation '' .",
    "this belief is associated with the concepts of direct cascade and of dissipation range and is incorrect if a direct cascade is not realizable .",
    "for example , for 2d ns turbulence in equilibrium , with @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) the only form of dissipation , the dissipation of energy ( enstrophy ) occurs mainly in the large scales ( around the forcing scale ) @xcite .",
    "this example means that there exists no dissipation range well separated from the forcing scale and that the viscous operator @xmath42 would have to be correctly termed `` large - scale dissipation '' . in this case",
    ", the degree of viscosity @xmath39 plays an important role in the spectral distribution of energy @xcite .",
    "the problem of nonlinear transfer and spectral distribution of quadratic quantities such as energy and enstrophy is best handled in wavenumber space .",
    "hence , it is convenient to formulate the present problem accordingly .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath44 , which represents the power density of @xmath45 ( for real @xmath9 ) associated with the wavenumber @xmath10 , is defined by @xmath46 is the fourier transform of @xmath23 , and the integral is over all wavevectors @xmath47 having magnitude @xmath10 . in this paper , most results apply to both unbounded and periodic ( bounded ) cases ; the integral over continuous wavenumbers is then understood as the corresponding sum over discrete wavenumbers for the bounded case .",
    "the evolution of @xmath48 is governed by @xmath49 here , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are , respectively , the spectral transfer and input functions .",
    "( see @xcite for the familiar ns case . ) by virtue of the conservation laws ( [ conservation ] ) , the transfer function @xmath50 satisfies @xmath52",
    "in this section , several a priori estimates of some relevant dynamical quantities are derived , and their implications for power - law scaling of the energy spectrum are discussed .",
    "the results obtained include upper bounds on the asymptotic averages of the dissipation of @xmath18 and @xmath19 and an upper bound on @xmath19 in terms of @xmath18 and the forcing wavenumber .    on multiplying ( [ governing ] ) by @xmath23 and @xmath22 and taking the spatial averages of the resulting equations , noting from the conservation laws that the nonlinear terms identically vanish , one obtains evolution equations for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath53 using the cauchy ",
    "schwarz and young inequalities and because the forcing spectral support is confined to the wavenumber interval @xmath54 $ ] , one obtains the upper bounds on the injection terms in ( [ eevolution ] ) and ( [ zevolution ] ) : @xmath55 the substitution of ( [ forcebounds ] ) in ( [ eevolution ] ) and ( [ zevolution ] ) yields @xmath56 these inequalities readily admit the upper bounds on the asymptotic averages of @xmath57 and @xmath58 : @xmath59 for a time - independent forcing @xmath29 , the asymptotic average on the right - hand sides of ( [ evolbound1 ] ) and ( [ evolbound2 ] ) reduces to @xmath60 .",
    "the upper bound ( [ evolbound1 ] ) on the asymptotic average of @xmath57 is interesting , particularly for the unbounded case .",
    "this bound prohibits the spectrum @xmath61 [ @xmath48 ] from acquiring a spectral scaling not shallower than @xmath63 [ @xmath64 in the limit @xmath65 because otherwise , a divergence of @xmath57 would entail .",
    "this means that a constant inverse flux of @xmath18 ( if it is realizable ) ought to proceed toward @xmath14 ( in the limit @xmath66 ) via a spectrum @xmath48 shallower than @xmath67 .",
    "this observation is intuitively obvious from the physical point of view : the proceeding of a sustainable inverse cascade is incompatible with a persistent increase in the dissipation of the inverse - cascading quantity .",
    "note that the critical scaling @xmath68 ( for @xmath69 ) may be realizable only down to a finite wavenumber @xmath70 and necessarily corresponds to an asymptotic absolute equilibrium of @xmath18 .    for the ns system ( @xmath2 and @xmath40 ) , @xmath71 ( the enstrophy ) is the dissipation agent of the energy @xmath12 .",
    "the above analysis implies that the enstrophy ( energy ) spectrum in the inverse - cascading region is no steeper than @xmath63 ( @xmath17 ) .",

    "this constraint is mathematically interesting in the bounded case , as the inequality is in the opposite sense to sobolev - type inequalities . in an unbounded domain where @xmath18 may grow unbounded whether or not an inverse cascade exists , ( [ dynconstraint2 ] ) becomes obvious .",

    "<S> two - dimensional turbulence governed by the so - called @xmath0 turbulence equations , which include the surface quasi - geostrophic equation ( @xmath1 ) , the navier  stokes system ( @xmath2 ) , and the governing equation for a shallow flow on a rotating domain driven by a uniform internal heating ( @xmath3 ) , is studied here in both the unbounded and doubly periodic domains . </S>",
    "<S> this family of equations conserves two inviscid invariants ( energy and enstrophy in the navier  stokes case ) , the dynamics of which are believed to undergo a dual cascade . it is shown that an inverse cascade can exist in the absence of a direct cascade and that the latter is possible only when the inverse transfer rate of the inverse - cascading quantity approaches its own injection rate . </S>",
    "<S> constraints on the spectral exponents in the wavenumber ranges lower and higher than the injection range are derived . for navier </S>",
