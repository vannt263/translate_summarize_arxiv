    "europa was observed over three nights in 2011 september 18 - 20 with the osiris integral field spectrograph and adaptive optics system on the keck ii telescope @xcite .",
    "observations were acquired at four orbital orientations within one europa orbit , and give nearly complete latitude / longitude coverage .",
    "spectra were obtained at moderate resolution ( r  @xmath5  3800 ) in the infrared h and k bands ( 1.473 - 1.803 and 1.956 - 2.381 @xmath3 m ) , at the 0.035@xmath6  pixel@xmath7 setting , and an angular resolution coarser than the detector resolution by a factor of @xmath42 .",
    "the disk of europa was @xmath41.03on the sky , yielding an average surface resolution of @xmath4150  km per spatial element .",
    "the osiris grid has a field of view 0.56@xmath82.24 , so that the entire disk of europa was captured with two exposures per spectral band .",
    "see table  [ table1 ] for the relevant orientations observed . for details regarding calibration , initial data reduction , and a complete journal of observations ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in addition to the calibration from @xcite , we make an extra correction to most accurately match spectra to specific locations on the surface .",
    "this task is slightly complicated by each hyperspectral full - disk consisting of four separate exposures , an east and west limb in the h and k bands ( table  [ table1 ] ) . due to europa s rotation , exposures in h and k separated by @xmath41 hour",
    "are offset in longitude by @xmath46@xmath9 or @xmath41.6 osiris pixels at the sub - observer point .",
    "to partially account for this , we use a lambertian surface to normalize each h and k observation to normal incidence .",
    "we then generate an artificial grid with the same resolution as osiris , centered at the average sub - observer longitude of the four exposures .",
    "the full h and k spectrum of each location in the new grid is obtained by nearest interpolation of the original exposures .",
    "this results in a spatial error between h and k spectra of @xmath101 osiris pixel or @xmath113.8@xmath9 longitude at the sub - observer point .",
    "in order to coherently map the surface composition of europa , we first seek the smallest number of unique observed surface spectra which , when linearly combined , can be used to optimally model all of the spectra on the surface of europa . while past efforts at such modeling have relied on matching laboratory - derived spectral libraries @xcite , or supervised selection of surface spectra @xcite , we instead take a purely empirical approach in order to remove preconceived assumptions on potential surface compositions .",
    "mathematically , we define the @xmath12 end members as the spectra at @xmath12 different locations which , when used as the basis set in a linear least - squares fit of the separate spectrum at each spatial location , minimizes the sum of the square of the residuals across the entire surface of europa . with this definition ,",
    "our task is then to determine @xmath12 , the appropriate number of end members , and what each end member spectrum is .",
    "there is an extensive literature on the subject of end member extraction and many possible approaches , and no single approach is preferred for all situations .",
    "we chose to develop our own unsupervised linear unmixing routine tailored for the osiris data set .",
    "we first filter out all spectra with obvious systematic noise , and those observed at more than 60@xmath9 from the sub - solar point .",
    "this leaves 1,591 high quality spectra from the four observations combined .",
    "we bin these to a spectral resolution of 10  nm for computational feasibility .",
    "we input all spectra into k - means algorithm @xcite to find @xmath12 cluster center spectra .",
    "we then find the observed spectra most similar to the @xmath12 cluster centers , and set these as the initial guesses for candidate end members .",
    "this initial degree of similarity is determined by the spectral angle mapping ( sam ) metric @xcite , where the angle @xmath13 between spectra is small for similar spectra and large for dissimilar spectra , and is defined : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are spectra .",
    "we take these @xmath12 spectra as candidate end members , and model each of the 1,591 observed spectra as a linear combination of the @xmath12 candidate spectra . for each of the 1,591 fits ,",

    "we hold all but one of the end member candidates fixed and substitute the remaining candidate with other observed spectra . as before ,",
    "the substituted spectrum and fixed candidates are used to model all 1,591 observed spectra , and the rms of each of the 1,591 fits is summed to give the total rms . if the substituted spectrum yields a lower total rms than the previous candidate , it becomes the new candidate .",
    "we iterate through all observed spectra to find the best new candidate .",
    "the process is repeated successively , alternating which end member is being substituted for .",
    "the process ends when the end members have converged , which occurs when a new candidate is not found for @xmath17 successive attempts .",
    "this process is illustrated for the @xmath18 case in the ternary plot in figure [ ternary ] .",
    "the end member candidates take turns to converge to the best end members at the corners of the plot .    ]    to determine the most appropriate @xmath12 , we use the simple approach of analyzing a range of @xmath12 and examining the successive residual maps . once the residual deviation has dropped to the level of noise , spatial structure in the residual maps",

    "there is significant spatial structure in the residual maps , indicating compositional regions where the model is inadequate with one or two end members .",
    "the rms level drops significantly from @xmath19 ( total rms = 42.7 ) to @xmath21 ( total rms = 23.6 ) and from @xmath21 to @xmath18 ( total rms = 11.4 ) , removing nearly all spatial coherence in the residual map .",
    "@xmath22 ( total rms = 9.9 ) and @xmath23 ( total rms = 9.4 ) give only small improvements over @xmath18 . remaining structure in the @xmath18 residuals may indicate further end members , however any further end members would be much less significant , and it is unclear if the remaining structure is related to the physical surface or to systematic noise , so we conservatively choose @xmath18 as the optimal case . as a test of convergence , we repeat the routine for @xmath18 using random initial candidates instead of the cluster center candidates . in 50 tests with random initial guesses ,",
    "the routine converged to only two results .",
    "both results are qualitatively and quantitatively similar .",
    "the better result has slightly lower total rms and was reached for 39 ( 78% ) of the random tests , and is the same result reached when using the initial guess from k - means + sam .",
    "with the approach outlined in the previous section , we find evidence for three distinct compositional units .",
    "their geographic distributions are given by their fractional weights in the linear mixture model ( fig .",
    "[ spec ] ) .",
    "their orthographic projections at the time of observation are shown in figure  [ ortho ] , and their cylindrical projections are shown in figure  [ latlon ] .",
    "component  1 dominates the trailing hemisphere bullseye region , component  2 dominates the leading hemisphere upper latitudes , and component  3 dominates several regions with unique shapes across the leading hemisphere equatorial regions .",
    "the most distinct regions of component  3 clearly rotate between the two september  19 observations ( fig .",
    "[ ortho ] ) , further confirming their existence .",

    "though the end members occupy only one spectral pixel each , linear combinations of these three adequately reproduce all observed spectra across the surface , and yield compositional regions with impressive spatial coherence .        ]",
    "it is interesting that component  3 was not discovered previously in nims data .",
    "though more geographically limited , nims low resolution data do reach the anti - jovian regions dominated by component  3 @xcite . however , previous work investigating compositional distributions at low spatial resolution @xcite focus on ice vs. hydrate fractional abundance , and do not attempt to distinguish between different hydrate species .",
    "the distinction between different hydrated minerals has been explored in nims high resolution data @xcite , which lacks the necessary surface coverage distinguish global trends .",
    "in fact , the anti - jovian regions dominated by component  3 are distinguishable in nims low resolution data , but were not previously recognized as a distinct composition .",
    "western powys regio particularly stands out in several water - ice abundance maps @xcite , but was not recognized as distinct from the dominant non - ice component centered on the trailing hemisphere bullseye .",
    "western powys and the adjacent chaos region at 180 w longitude are most noticeable in the quality of fit map in plate  2 of @xcite , where the poorer quality of fit is clearly associated with these regions , indicating a distinct composition .",
    "these regions are also seen in @xcite , which maps the sulfuric acid abundance and average hydrate abundance to nims low resolution data ; the regions corresponding to component  3 stand out in average hydrate abundance but not in sulfuric acid abundance .",
    "thus nims data are consistent with our results .",
    "the observed spectra of the three compositions are shown in fig .",
    "we model each hyperspectral pixel as a linear combination of these three end member spectra , and find that the entire surface at the @xmath4100  km scale is sufficiently described by a mixture of these three components .",

    "component  1 resembles a darkened and broadened ice spectrum .",
    "the features of component  2 are the least distorted and have the strongest band depths , indicating that this component has the greatest fraction of pure water - ice .",
    "component  3 resembles a flattened water - ice spectrum with slightly broadened and shifted features .",
    "distorted water - ice spectra such as this suggest hydrated species @xcite , though the lack of additional features makes a unique identification difficult",

    "gray lines show the true spectral resolution ; colored spectra are binned to a resolution of 1  nm .",
    "the nims europa hydrate spectrum @xcite is overplotted in black and scaled for comparison .",
    "note the similarity of nims to component  1 , though at a much coarser resolution.[spec ] ]    the geographic distribution of each component is a strong indication of its identity .",
    "the distribution of component  1 is globally symmetric , centered on the trailing hemisphere equator .",
    "this is consistent with the known patterns of enhanced irradiation and bombardment from the jovian magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "this strongly suggests that component  1 is exogenous , or initially endogenous but heavily altered by exogenous processes .",
    "component  2 dominates the leading hemisphere polar regions , consistent with the known distribution of pure water ice or deposited water ice frost @xcite . unlike components  1 and 2 , the distribution of component  3 is not globally symmetric , nor is it consistent with regions known to be compositionally distinct .",
    "the shapes of the regions dominated by component  3 are revealing ; they are markedly similar to geologic units of chaos as mapped by @xcite , to within the angular resolution of our observations .",
    "though the spectral pixel identified as component  3 is located within western powys regio , it also dominates the abundance in other regions ; tara regio chaos in particular is reproduced remarkably well ( figs .",
    "[ ortho ] , [ latlon ] , @xmath485  w ) .",
    "chaos regions are believed to represent areas of recent interaction with the subsurface , and a variety of mechanisms have been proposed including widescale diapiric upwelling @xcite , melt - through @xcite , and lens - collapse @xcite .",
    "thus , the association of component  3 with chaos suggests an initially endogenous composition , less altered by exogenous processes than the trailing hemisphere .",
    "the trailing hemisphere is also covered with large chaos regions , in which we see no evidence for component  3 .",
    "our interpretation is that component  3 contains the greatest fraction of salts derived from the subsurface , possibly a brine or evaporite deposit .",
    "the lack of component  3 on the trailing hemisphere is due to enhanced exogenous alteration , where the surface has been coated with a layer of irradiation products , primarily sulfuric acid hydrate @xcite .",
    "an endogenous composition likely exists at greater depth in trailing hemisphere chaos regions , where it is shielded from exogenous processes and nir remote sensing .    it was suggested from nims spectra that hydrated salts are abundant on europa s surface , particularly na- and mg - sulfates @xcite .",
    "laboratory spectra of these salts have been used extensively to model high spatial resolution nims data @xcite . following these analyses ,",
    "we perform similar linear mixture modeling to the osiris data .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fits ] . in the fits",
    "shown , we include h@xmath0so@xmath1 hydrate , mirabilite ( na@xmath0so@xmath2410h@xmath0o ) , hexahydrite ( mgso@xmath246h@xmath0o ) , bloedite ( na@xmath0mg(so@xmath1)@xmath254h@xmath0o ) , mgso@xmath1 brine , and water ice at grain sizes of 50 , 75 , 100 , 250 , and 1000 @xmath3 m .",
    "the fit to component  1 is generally satisfying .",
    "this method finds that component  1 is dominated by h@xmath0so@xmath1 with lesser amounts of the modeled salts and water ice , consistent with an exogenous interpretation .",

    "the result for component  3 is 42% bloedite , 37% 50  @xmath3 m h@xmath0o ice , 11% mirabilite , 10% h@xmath0so@xmath24nh@xmath0o , and @xmath101% mgso@xmath1 brine , hexahydrite , and h@xmath0o ice at 75 , 100 , 250 , and 1000  @xmath3m.[fits ] ]    though this result is enticing , the quality of the spectral fit is unacceptably poor ( fig .",
    "[ fits ] ) .",
    "although a linear mixture of these species is able to match the coarse continuum level , it is not able to fit the shape and depth of distinct features in the h band , or the distorted shape of the 2.2  @xmath3 m peak in the k band .",
    "this remains true even when we relax the constraints of the linear mixture model : in the fits shown , we include a dark neutral substance with a spectral slope , and do not restrict the sum of the components to match 100% .",
    "figure  [ nonice ] compares the observed spectra to the laboratory spectra .",
    "conversely , figure  [ nonice ] shows significant differences between component  3 and the hydrated sulfate salts considered .",
    "each of these salts possesses distinct features that should be seen in the observed spectra , if they were present in abundance .",
    "though the results of linear mixtures with these salts are consistent with an endogenous interpretation , the individual sulfate salts considered can not be present in abundance .    ]    at the observed wavelengths , the defining spectral characteristics of component  3 are the distortion of water - of - hydration features and the lack of additional , non - water - ice features .",
    "thus the species making up component  3 must share these characteristics .",
    "one possible alternative composition is anhydrous chloride salts such as nacl , kcl ( fig .",
    "[ salt ] ) . note that the term anhydrous is relative , e.g. baking at 400@xmath9c for days is not sufficient to remove all of the bound water , so residual features persist @xcite .",
    "in the case of nacl , the anhydrous phase is more spectrally similar to the observed spectra than the brine phase ( figures 1 and 4 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the chlorate and perchlorate salts from @xcite possess distinct spectral features not seen in the observed spectra .",
    "anhydrous salts could indeed be present on europa s surface ; evaporite deposits are speculated to result from exposure of a brine to europa s surface conditions through the processes of sublimation , freezing , and flash evaporation @xcite . a search through the literature of published spectra at conditions relevant to europa and spectral resolution comparable to osiris revealed naclo and naoh @xcite , which are conceivable radiolytic products of a nacl - h@xmath0o substrate , and nahco@xmath27 brine @xcite , which is a plausible endogenous species .",
    "other carbonate salts are also plausible , but must be investigated at appropriate conditions and moderate spectral resolution .    ]",
    "the traditional view that europa s endogenous non - ice component is dominated by mg - sulfates traces back at least as far as @xcite , which found the system mgso@xmath1-na@xmath0so@xmath1-h@xmath0o to be the favored product of aqueously differentiated carbonaceous chondrites in conditions expected for icy satellites .",
    "this served as a working hypothesis for early nims investigations such as @xcite , which found an expected spectral agreement between nims and sulfate salts .",
    "this story was further supported by chondrite - leaching experiments @xcite and subsequent geochemical modeling @xcite .",
    "later nims investigations showed that the spectra are better explained by mixtures of sulfuric acid and hydrated salts , but still focus solely on sulfate salts @xcite .",
    "these results made for a satisfying , consistent story . however , there are many caveats to this story , and a growing body of work is challenging the traditional view .",
    "the spectroscopic argument set in motion by early nims investigations relied on an even smaller spectral library than exists today , among which hydrated sulfate salt minerals were one of the few items .",
    "furthermore , nims investigations face the challenge of low spectral resolution ; the spectral similarity amongst hydrated species makes the ability to spectrally distinguish between them difficult , and this difficulty is exacerbated at low spectral resolution , where small features are smoothed out and the subtle but significant shape of the continuum is less apparent .",
    "osiris observations show that the nir moderate resolution spectra of the entire surface resembles water - ice , precluding the possibility for species with distinct non - ice spectral features .",
    "the only exception to this is the 2.07  @xmath3 m feature attributed to epsomite @xcite .",
    "ironically , the identification of epsomite challenges the case for endogenous sulfates , due to the geographical association of epsomite with exogenous and not endogenous processes . the osiris spectra are in good agreement with similar observations from @xcite , which resolve ice and non - ice units and find equally smooth , featureless spectra .",
    "@xcite also conclude that higher resolution spectra are inconsistent with the crystalline hydrates considered .",
    "geochemical models predicting surface composition also claim a large degree of uncertainty .",
    "@xcite notes that sufficiently alkaline conditions during aqueous alteration would stabilize mg and fe in mg / fe - hydroxides , preventing significant amounts of mg in the solution , or that sufficiently acidic conditions could favor more abundant carbonates in solution .",
    "@xcite explores a wide variety of alternative surface compositions , and for example notes that the hydrothermal processes causing a nacl ocean on earth could also occur on europa under the right conditions .",
    "@xcite raise many objections to the models favoring a mgso@xmath1-dominated system , including a possibly incorrect initial composition , the irrelevant conditions of chondrite leaching experiments of @xcite , and the difficulty of forming sulfate in reducing conditions .",
    "however , though surface and ocean composition are certainly related , the exact relationship is uncertain ; an alternative surface composition suggests but does not necessarily require an alternative ocean composition .",
    "for example , @xcite point out that freezing leads to brines of different composition than the ocean , and that endogenous surface salts may only be the end member of a compositional stratification throughout the ice shell .",
    "europa s known atmospheric composition further challenges the traditional view .",
    "the tenuous atmosphere is produced by sputtering of surface material @xcite ; thus surface and atmosphere compostion are intimately related .",
    "the presence of na @xcite and k @xcite in the sputtered atmosphere is established , and their relative abundances provide a compelling argument for an endogenous source @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the non - detection of atmospheric mg @xcite constrains its surface abundance and challenges the traditional view of an endogenous surface component dominated by the mg cation .",
    "enceladus may represent an analogous environment to europa , and enceladus plume composition also suggests an alternative salty component .",
    "na , k , cl , and co@xmath27 have all been detected , whereas mg and so@xmath1 have not @xcite .",
    "using a geochemical model based on the empirical evidence , @xcite favor an enceladus ocean composition of na - cl - co@xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , recent work by @xcite shows that irradiated alkali halides such as nacl can describe the yellow to brown colors and coarse continuum level of europa s visible spectrum .",
    "the formation of similar color centers in sulfate salts is less certain but many sulfates bleach to white rapidly after irradiation or stay colorless in the visible even after irradiation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hand , k.  p. et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "previously , the darker colors seen by _ galileo _ solid state imager ( ssi ) were attributed to a mixture with an unknown associated species that is featureless in the infrared @xcite .",
    "this work further supports that the traditional view of europa s endogenous surface composition must be reconsidered .",
    "we find evidence that europa s surface consists of three distinct compositional units at the @xmath4100  km scale .",
    "we identify the endogenous composition based on association with geologic chaos units , and show that its spectrum is inconsistent with hydrated sulfate minerals at moderate resolution .",
    "the implications of alternative salts for habitability are intriguing but difficult to interpret , even with a complete knowledge of surface composition and subsurface exchange .",
    "we can speculate that the dominant ocean salt has implications for salinity , which may be a limiting factor for the origin of life and the ability for life to thrive .",
    "though the salinity of the europan ocean is only marginally constrained , an ocean dominated by na@xmath28 and cl@xmath29 could imply a lower salinity compared to mg@xmath30 and so@xmath31 , by a factor of @xmath43 for the upper limit of measured ocean conductivity @xcite .",
    "we can also speculate that biological processes , if present , may manifest themselves in the endogenous surface composition .",
    "for example , a europan biosphere supported by sulfate reduction @xcite could result in an ocean depleted in sulfate , if the supply of sulfate is the limiting factor for biomass production .",
    "this scenario is likely inconsistent with a surface abundant in endogenous sulfate .",
    "similarly , a europan biosphere supported by methanogenesis could yield a relatively reduced methane - rich ocean or a relatively oxidized sulfate- and bicarbonate - rich ocean @xcite , leading to an endogenous surface enhaced in the respective species .",
    "however , abioligical processes are likely able to explain surface composition as well , and such interpretations should be favored while definitive evidence for biological activity is lacking .",
    "we find evidence for three distinct compositions across europa s surface at the @xmath4100 km scale , from hyperspectral observations with keck ii osiris and adaptive optics .",
    "the first component dominates the trailing hemisphere bullseye and the second component dominates the leading hemisphere upper latitudes , consistent with regions previously found to be dominated by irradiation products and water ice , respectively .",
    "the third component is geographically associated with large geologic units of chaos , suggesting an endogenous identity .",
    "this is the first time that the endogenous hydrate species has been mapped at a global scale .",
    "europa s moderate resolution surface spectra in the nir are ubiquitously smooth , distorted water - ice spectra .",
    "the spectrum of component  3 is not consistent with linear mixtures of the current spectral library .",
    "in particular , the hydrated sulfate minerals previously favored possess distinct spectral features that are not present in the spectrum of component  3 , and thus can not be abundant at large scale .",
    "one alternative composition is chloride evaporite deposits , possibly indicating an ocean solute composition dominated by the na@xmath28 and cl@xmath29 ions .",
    "the traditional view that europa s non - ice endogenous surface is dominated by hydrated mg - sulfates must be reconsidered .",
    "higher resolution surface spectra at greater geographic coverage , as well as insight from new laboratory irradiation experiments , atmospheric composition , and analogy to enceladus all point toward a new understanding of europa s endogenous hydrate .",
