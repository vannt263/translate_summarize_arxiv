    "the inelastic hard spheres model  @xcite without energy input , initially prepared in a homogeneous state , exhibits , after a rapid transient , a regime characterized by homogeneous density and a probability distribution of velocities that depends on time only through the total kinetic energy ( global granular temperature @xmath0 ) , i.e. a scaling velocity distribution .",
    "this is the so called _ homogeneous cooling state _ ( hcs ) or haff regime  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown by several authors  @xcite that this state is unstable with respect to shear and clustering instabilities : structures can form that seem to minimize dissipation , mainly in the form of velocity vortices and high density clusters .",
    "these instabilities grow on different space and time scales , so that one can investigate them separately .",
    "several theories have been proposed to take into account the emergence of structures in granular gases .",
    "some of these are more fundamental , because derive the correlation functions directly from the kinetic equations  @xcite ; others , that assume the validity of the hydrodynamic description , deserve the name of mesoscopic theories  @xcite ; others are phenomenological theories that suggest analogies with burgers equation  @xcite or spinodal decomposition models  @xcite or mode coupling theories  @xcite",
    ". some of these theories can describe the behavior of the cooling granular gas far deeply into the correlated regime , giving predictions for the asymptotic decay of energy . in this paper , after a brief summary of the results of these theories , we show how the departure from the hcs can be well modeled by a class of models obtained placing on a lattice the original homogeneous inelastic maxwell model .",
    "these models have the disadvantages of being conceived under the assumption of negligible density fluctuations and therefore can be useful only in the description of the first instability , i.e. the growth of velocity fluctuations . in section 2 we review the hcs , its instabilities and the existing theories . in section 3",
    "we briefly discuss the inelastic maxwell model  @xcite , which is a starting point for the introduction of the inelastic lattice maxwell models ( ilmm ) . in section 4 and in section 5 the analysis and results of the ilmm in one and two dimensions",
    "are reviewed  @xcite . finally in section 6 conclusions are drawn .",
    "a cooling granular gas in @xmath1 dimensions is defined as an ensemble of @xmath2 grains , i.e. hard objects ( rods if @xmath3 , disks if @xmath4 , spheres if @xmath5 ) of linear size ( diameter ) @xmath6 , placed in a volume @xmath7 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the grains evolve freely and interact with each other through instantaneous binary inelastic collisions . the rule that gives the velocities after the collision as functions of the velocities before the collision is the definition of the particular granular gas model . in this case",
    "we use the model with constant restitution coefficient without rotational degrees of freedom and set the mass of the grains @xmath8 .",
    "other models have been considered in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the collision rule between a particle with velocity @xmath9 and one with velocity @xmath10 for this model is :    @xmath11\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}\\ ] ]    where the primed velocity is the post - collisional one , @xmath12 is the unit vector in the direction joining the centers of colliding particles , and @xmath13 is the restitution coefficient and takes values between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "when @xmath16 the collision is elastic .",
    "usually ( in numerical or real experiments ) granular gases are prepared in a homogeneous situation : uniform - random positions of grains , gaussian or uniform - random initial velocity with no preferred direction .",
    "it happens that , if the system is large enough or the inelasticity large enough , the imposed homogeneity is broken after a certain time .",
    "the more accepted scenario is a two time homogeneity breaking : at a time @xmath17 the velocity field becomes unstable to the formation of shear bands , then at a time @xmath18 the density field becomes unstable toward the formation of high density clusters .      a granular gas evolving from a homogeneously random state loses memory of its initial condition after a time of the order of one collision per particle and rapidly enters the homogeneous cooling regime .",
    "this regime is expected to be well described by the granular boltzmann equation ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "this means that in this regime the total probability density function ( p.d.f . ) at collision is factorisable in one - particle p.d.f.s : @xmath19 .",
    "the kinetic definition of hcs is given by the homogeneity ansatz plus the scaling ansatz for the one particle distribution function :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the thermal velocity defined by @xmath23 with @xmath24 the granular temperature ; here we have assumed that @xmath25 and also that @xmath26 . if the eq .",
    "is inserted in the boltzmann equation an equation for the temperature is obtained :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the time dependent collision frequency , while @xmath29 is the time independent cooling rate .",
    "these two functions can be approximated , using the maxwellian approximation @xmath30 , by @xmath31 and @xmath32 :    @xmath33    in this case the solution of the temperature equation reads :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the mean free time at the initial temperature @xmath36 and    @xmath37    is the cumulated collision number obtained from the definition @xmath38 .",
    "eq . is known as haff s law  @xcite .",
    "corrections to the constants appearing in eq .",
    "stem from a more careful consideration of the hcs : when the volume fraction is non negligible the enskog - boltzmann equation should be employed instead of boltzmann equation .",
    "this is identical to the boltzmann equation but for a multiplicative constant in the collision integral that takes into account static density correlations due to the fact that the gas is not perfectly dilute .",
    "very recently it has been shown  @xcite that there are also small velocity correlations which must be considered and that modify the molecular chaos hypothesis : with this correlations the law @xmath39 is still valid but more precise corrections to the constant @xmath40 appear .",
    "the haff law can be also derived in the framework of granular hydrodynamics  @xcite : in the hcs hydrodynamics can be considered valid as a consequence of homogeneity of the density and velocity field and of the slow temperature decay .",
    "the evolution of the ( space uniform ) temperature field is exactly the same as in eq .  .",
    "kinetic arguments , linear stability analysis of hydrodynamic equations and numerical simulations lead to the evidence that the hcs is unstable .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that large scale fluctuations of velocity and density can grow exponentially breaking the homogeneity of the system . the fact that the fluctuations arise at large scale means that , if the system is small enough , the hcs lasts forever .",
    "moreover the minimum scale of formation of fluctuations depends upon inelasticities and is smaller at larger inelasticities : this means that for a quasi - elastic gas it is necessary to take a very large volume to observe the breaking of homogeneity .     for shear ( @xmath41 ) , heat ( @xmath42 ) and sound ( @xmath43 ) modes versus @xmath44 for inelastic hard disks with @xmath45 at a packing fraction @xmath46 .",
    "the dashed line indicate the imaginary parts of the sound modes . here",
    "@xmath6 is the diameter of a particle .",
    "( from orza et al .",
    "@xcite)[apfig_disp_rel ] ]    the linear stability analysis of hydrodynamics gives a good description of the instability of fluctuations .",
    "the procedure is applied to the fields rescaled with respect to the homogeneous cooling state , i.e. @xmath47 ( being @xmath48 the average density ) , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and therefore any instability or emerging structure is not absolute but relative to this decaying reference state .",
    "moreover the instabilities are studied in @xmath51 space ( the space of fourier modes ) and , when @xmath52 , the velocity field is decomposed in a parallel component @xmath53 and in @xmath54 orthogonal components @xmath55 with respect to the vector @xmath51 . in figure  [ apfig_disp_rel ]",
    "we report the results of such an analysis , taken from the literature  @xcite .",
    "this analysis shows that the evolution of fluctuations of normal velocity components ( shear modes , @xmath56 ) are not coupled with any other fluctuating component . at the same time , the remaining components are coupled together .",
    "the rate of decay / growth for the shear mode reads @xmath57 where @xmath58 depends on the transport coefficients appearing in the hydrodynamics .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for detailed calculations of this correlation length . at low values of @xmath59 ( in the so - called `` dissipative range '' )",
    "also the heat mode is `` pure '' , as it is given by the longitudinal velocity mode @xmath60 only , with eigenvalue @xmath61 ; in this range the sound modes are combination of density and temperature fluctuations .",
    "the most important result of this analysis is that @xmath62 and @xmath63 are _ positive _ below the threshold values @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively , indicating two linearly unstable modes with exponential ( in @xmath66 , i.e. the time measured by the cumulated number of collisions per particle ) growth rates .",
    "here we have used the notation @xmath67 .",
    "the shear and heat instabilities are well separated at low inelasticity ( i.e. low @xmath68 ) , as @xmath69 while @xmath70 , so that @xmath71 .",
    "it is also important to note that the linear total size @xmath72 of the system can suppress the various instability , because the minimum wave number @xmath73 can be larger than @xmath74 or even than @xmath75 .",
    "when fluctuations grow , structures emerge . in molecular dynamics simulations",
    "these structure appear as shocks in @xmath3 , or vortices and clusters in @xmath4 . in @xmath76 , a detailed analysis of structure factors ( from fluctuating hydrodynamics  @xcite or ring kinetic theory  @xcite )",
    "has established that all the main correlation lengths ( which indicate the typical size of structures _ in the rescaled fields _ ) should grow as @xmath77 . in particular this",
    "is expected for the size of vortices @xmath78 and the size of clusters @xmath79 : this again shows that , at small inelasticities @xmath68 , the size of clusters grows more slowly than that of vortices .      after a brief transient during which the instabilities grow exponentially in @xmath66 with the rates given above , the description suggested by linear stability analysis ceases to be meaningful .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) , in the absence of experiments ( the cooling granular gas being a reference model and not a real system ) , are the more reliable tools , but they are very cpu - time consuming : to obtain a decent statistics of the asymptotic dynamics of a granular gas , large enough to observe instabilities , md simulations must be carried on for days . to our knowledge a definitive clear picture of the asymptotics of this model is still lacking ( with month - lasting simulations isobe  @xcite has obtained what he called the `` final state '' , which resembles 2d turbulence , but this was done in a quasi - elastic limit ) .    on the other side",
    "there are effective models that can grasp the essence of the phenomena with particular assumptions . here",
    "we rapidly review some of these :    * brito and ernst have shown by means of a mode - coupling  @xcite theory that the asymptotic energy decay should follow a diffusive form @xmath80 . *",
    "wakou et al .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that the evolution of the flow field of a granular fluid , neglecting the convective term @xmath81 , can be cast in the form of a time dependent ginzburg - landau equation for a non - conserved order parameter .",
    "the energy functional has a _ continuous _ set of degenerate minima , having the shape of a mexican hat . when the convective term is added , only subsets of admissible solutions are selected out of this infinite set of minima . in two dimensions",
    "only _ two _ distinct minima survive : therefore the @xmath4 cooling granular gas , during the formation of instabilities , greatly resembles the spinodal decomposition for a non - conserved order parameter ( model a universality class , in the hohenberg - halperin classification  @xcite ) . *",
    "ben - naim et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the cooling granular gas in @xmath3 , discovering that , after the homogeneous ( haff ) phase , it asymptotically becomes independent of the value of inelasticity @xmath68 and maps onto the sticky gas model .",
    "for such a sticky gas the asymptotic temperature decay is proportional to @xmath82 , when density clusters and velocity shocks form .",
    "the velocity field of the sticky gas  @xcite is described by the inviscid limit of the burgers equation  @xcite .",
    "the relation to the burgers equation is useful to establish an estimate of the tails of the asymptotic velocity distribution @xmath83 ( independent of @xmath13 ) , which reads @xmath84 .",
    "the md simulations have revealed only slight deviations from the gaussian , and the authors have imputed the discrepancy from the expected behavior to the smallness of the constant in front of @xmath85 .",
    "more recently it has been conjectured  @xcite that the burgers equation describes the flow velocity @xmath86 of a cooling granular gas for arbitrary values of the inelasticity @xmath68 in generic @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "this conjecture implies that the asymptotic behavior of the cooling inelastic gas is independent of @xmath68 ( as it always falls in the universality class of the sticky gas ) and that the upper critical dimension for the disappearance of the inelastic collapse is @xmath87 .",
    "however md simulations in @xmath88 seem to show that the shear instability and the inelastic collapse do not disappear  @xcite .",
    "to better illustrate the analysis of the inelastic lattice maxwell models ( ilmm ) we start with a brief description of the homogeneous inelastic maxwell model ( imm ) .",
    "the definition of the model is given in terms of its boltzmann equation , which , for scalar velocities ( @xmath3 ) , reads :    @xmath89    with @xmath90 .",
    "the imm can be introduced in different ways : ( a ) its boltzmann equation can be regarded as the master equation of a simple stochastic process inspired to a model put forward by s.ulam",
    "@xcite : the process consists in the evolution of an ensemble of @xmath2 velocities , at each time step ( corresponding to @xmath91 , so that @xmath66 increases of @xmath15 after averagely one collision per particle ) two velocities are chosen at random with uniform distribution and are changed according to the inelastic collision rule ; ( b ) the associated boltzmann equation can be considered the inelastic generalization of the equation for elastic maxwell molecules  @xcite ; ( c ) its boltzmann equation can be derived from the ordinary boltzmann equation for inelastic hard spheres assuming that the term @xmath92 in the collision integral can be approximated by @xmath93 , as suggested by bobylev et al .  @xcite .",
    "the recent surge of interest for this model has been triggered by the discovery of an exact solution  @xcite for the @xmath3 case ( eq .  ) and the appearance of computable power law tails in the solutions of @xmath52 cases .",
    "@xcite . in a previous paper",
    "ben - naim and krapivsky  @xcite showed that eq .",
    "could not have a scaling solution with finite moments : in fact , a scaling form    @xmath94    with @xmath95 , imposes a temporal dependence of the higher moments ( if finite ) :    [ apscaling - moments ] @xmath96    does not depend on time .",
    "but they found that    @xmath97    this result does not exclude the existence of a scaling solution   but requires a solution with diverging moments of order @xmath98 , i.e. very large algebraic tails . in this case standard methods  @xcite based on fourier transform fails due to the singularity in @xmath99 corresponding to such algebraic tails .     versus @xmath100 for different values of @xmath13 from the simulation of the inelastic maxwell model in 1d ( left ) and 2d ( right ) .",

    "in 1d , the chosen initial distribution ( exponential ) is drawn ( same result with uniform and gaussian initial distribution ) . in 2d the distributions still present power - law tails , but the power depends upon @xmath13 : for @xmath101 the pdf tends to a maxwell distribution .",

    "the problem of a scaling solution has been recently addressed in  @xcite .",
    "assuming a solution with large algebraic tails , it is possible to compute the asymptotic exponent as a solution of a transcendental equation .",
    "such equation depends explicitly on the restitution coefficient , indicating that the tail exponent varies with @xmath13 ( and correctly diverges for @xmath101 , corresponding to the recovering of the maxwell distribution for the elastic case ) .",

    "the debate on the asymptotic energy seems to be still open , even if there are strong indications of a universal ( independent of @xmath13 ) decay of the form @xmath150",
    "a recent work of isobe  @xcite demonstrates that many features of the `` last '' stage resemble the dynamics of 2d turbulence .",
    "the ilmm in @xmath4 is identical to that in @xmath3 except for the fact that the particles have a @xmath108-components vector velocity @xmath151 and that they are placed on a triangular @xmath152 lattice , i.e. every particle has @xmath153 neighbors .",
    "the dynamics is the same as in @xmath3 ; the kinematic constraint here reads @xmath154 .     and @xmath155 ( @xmath156 sites ) .",
    "the bold dashed line @xmath157 is a guide to the eye for the asymptotic energy decay , while the light dashed line is the exponential fit corresponding to the haff law @xmath158 .",

    "the asymptotic decay reads @xmath163 .",
    "both this measurement and the decay observed in the @xmath3 case , are compatible with a universal law @xmath164 as for a purely diffusive field .     and",
    "the distributions are rescaled in order to have unit variance .",
    "the initial distribution is a gaussian . the distribution becomes broader in the uncorrelated phase ( first regime ) , and then turns back toward a gaussian .",
    "[ apfig_vdist_2d ] ]    the rescaled velocity pdf s ( see figure  [ apfig_vdist_2d ] ) , which are initially gaussian , become non - gaussian in the haff regime , with larger tails , but return gaussian in the late stage .",
    "the analysis that follows shows that , in the late stage , the velocity field is far from being homogeneous : the global velocity pdf is strongly influenced by this homogeneity and its gaussian form could be simply the signature of the presence of many independent domains ( i.e. it is just the distribution of the average velocities of these domains ) .    in the figures  [ apfig_vorticia_2d ] and  [ apfig_vorticib_2d ] we show the presence of vortices in the velocity fields .",
    "the second figure represents the same system at a later time , demonstrating the coarsening of vortices ( their number reduces and their size increases ) .    ) and longitudinal ( @xmath166 ) structure functions for @xmath167 and @xmath45 ( system size @xmath156 sites , times ranging from @xmath168 to @xmath169 ) .",

    "the analysis of the structure factor , shown in figure  [ apfig_sf_2d ] , is performed for two systems at different inelasticities .",
    "the common feature is a good collapse of different time curves if plotted against @xmath129 which is the signature of a domain growth ( diameter of the vortices ) @xmath177 .",
    "the elasticity however changes dramatically the other features : the more elastic system has a gaussian structure factor at large scale ( low values of @xmath59 ) and a plateau at small scales , i.e. quasi - elastic collisions randomize neighbour velocities while the effect of inelasticity induces a structure at large scale .",
    "the less elastic system does not present such a plateau , but a decay @xmath178 at small scales which is analogous to the porod law  @xcite expected from the presence of defects in a phase ordering process .",
    "the difference between transversal and longitudinal component ( more appreciable in the quasi - elastic system ) is coherent with the theoretical analysis discussed in the introduction , which predicts an earlier and stronger correlation for the transversal compoenent .    .",

    "both the longitudinal and transverval components are distributed with non - gaussian tails , but the longitudinal component presents also a strong asymmetry : this means that preferentially there are strong velocity differences in the direction of growing longitudinal velocity .",

    "later , @xmath191 reaches an `` aging '' regime and depends only on the ratio @xmath192 .",
    "this _ tti _",
    "transient regime is similar to what occurs during the coarsening process of a quenched magnetic system : the self - correlation of the local magnetization @xmath193 for @xmath194 shows a _ tti _ decay toward a constant value @xmath195 that is the square of the equilibrium magnetization , indicating that the local magnetization is evolving in an ergodic - like fashion .",
    "thereafter the self - correlation decays with the _ aging _ scaling law indicated above .",
    "obviously , when @xmath196 , the _ tti _ transient regime disappears . in our model the behavior of the self - correlation is even more subtle , as the cooling process imposes a ( slowly ) decreasing `` equilibrium '' temperature @xmath196 : this progressively erodes the _ tti _ regime and better resembles a finite rate quench .",
    "the same dependence on the _ tti _ manifests itself in the angular auto - correlation , shown in figure  [ apfig_ac_2d ] :    @xmath197    the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath198 suggests that the initial direction of the velocity induces a change in the velocities of the surrounding particles , which in turn generates , through a sequence of correlated collisions , a kind of retarded field oriented as the initial velocity .",
    "as @xmath199 increases the maximum is less and less pronounced .    the behavior of the energy decay ( @xmath164 ) , the law of growth of domains ( @xmath177 ) and the `` aging '' form of the two - times self - correlations , as well as the gaussian velocity pdf s and the gaussian form at large scale in the structure factors , are strong evidence that the model behaves similarly to a system governed by the diffusion equation :    @xmath200    where @xmath201 is a suitable field depending on the velocity field ( it could be a scalar , for example the @xmath202-component of the vorticity field @xmath203 ) .    , for two different values of the restitution coefficient .",
    "the power - law regime corresponds to the correlated regime .",
    "the measured exponent @xmath204 is , with this precision , equal to the persistence exponent numerically measured in the diffusive dynamics.[apfig_pers_2d ] ]    to perform a further check of this conjecture , we have measured the persistence exponent  @xcite of the model , which is very sensitive to the class of universality .",
    "we have counted the number @xmath205 of sites where the @xmath206 velocity component never changed sign from the starting time of the dynamics up to time @xmath66 . in the correlated regime",
    "we observe @xmath207 with @xmath204 which is equal , up to this precision , to the persistence exponent numerically measured for the diffusive dynamics .    ,",
    "defined as function of the coarse graining size @xmath6 for @xmath159 ( incoherent regime ) and @xmath160 ( correlated regime for both choices of @xmath13 ) : the system is the same of figure  [ apfig_energia_2d ] . in the correlated regime",
    "the more elastic case presents a plateau at intermediate wavelengths , indicating a well defined _",
    "mesoscopic _ temperature , and therefore a clear separation between the microscopic and the macroscopic scales.[apfig_tempint_2d ] ]    in the spirit of verifying the possibility of a hydrodynamic ( mesoscopic ) description of this model , we have also analysed the average local granular temperature @xmath208 , defined as :    @xmath209    where @xmath210 means an average on a region of linear size @xmath6 .    if we call @xmath180 a characteristic correlation length of the system , since when @xmath211 the local average tends to the global ( zero ) momentum , then @xmath212 .",

    "the behavior of @xmath215 in the uncorrelated ( haff ) regime and in the correlated ( asymptotic ) regime for two different values of @xmath13 is presented in figure  [ apfig_tempint_2d ] . for quasi elastic systems",
    "@xmath215 exhibits a plateau for @xmath216 that identifies the strength of the internal noise ( see also the plateau in the structure factor , figure  [ apfig_sf_2d ] ) and indicates the mesoscopic scale necessary for a hydrodynamics description . the local temperature ceases to be well defined for smaller @xmath13 , revealing an absence of scale separation between microscopic and macroscopic fluctuations in the strongly inelastic regime  @xcite .",
    "we have analysed essentially three different problems with a strong interconnection , in the framework of the physics of cooling granular gases .",
    "our first step ( imm ) was to demonstrate that a simplified 1d version of the boltzmann equation for inelastic gases can be exactly solved by a @xmath217 with power law tails .",
    "however , realistic granular systems never show such large tails : the key feature that must be added to this oversimplified model is a realistic topology .",
    "therefore our second step ( ilmm , @xmath3 ) was to embed the imm on a @xmath218 lattice .",
    "the @xmath217 changes dramatically and becomes identical to those measured in md simulations , also in the velocity - correlated stage .",
    "moreover , the ilmm allows for a study of spatial correlations , resulting in shock - like structures very similar to the one observed in md and strong analogies with the md structure functions .",
    "our last step ( ilmm , @xmath4 ) has been the passage from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , which mainly results in the appearance of vortices .",
    "vortices are ubiquitous in granular gases experiments and simulations .",
    "the ilmm simply produces vortices as a result of the competion between the parallelizing effect of inelastic collisions and the constraint given by the conservation of total momentum .",
    "moreover , a large set of evidences ( energy decay , structure factors , gaussian velocity pdf s , aging self - correlations , persistence exponent ) indicate that the dynamical behavior of the system is compatible with a diffusion equation , even if short scale defects ( appearing as shocks , internal noise and tails _  la _ porod in the structure functions ) make this model richer ."
