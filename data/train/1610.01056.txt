    "in a laboratory that has equations on a blackboard and devices on a bench , a fair question is how do the equations and the devices connect ?",
    "the terms of the equations act as words of a language used in the laboratory .",
    "people say or write these terms along with non - mathematical words ( _ e.g. _  ` screwdriver ' ) while they work with devices , an activity wittgenstein characterized as a _ language game _",
    "recently we brought the writing of equations and the using of devices into a common language game .",
    "this allowed us to prove that deciding to describe a particular laboratory situation by a particular quantum mechanical model takes something beyond logic and measured data , something aptly called a _ guess _ @xcite .    here",
    "are three examples of questions in quantum cryptography resolvable only by augmenting equations and data by guesswork :    \\1 .",
    "alice and bob interpret some equations as describing a transmitter and a receiver for quantum - cryptographic key distribution .",
    "how do they make or buy devices that behave in accord with those equations ?",
    "bob uses quantum - electrodynamics to define photons in terms of creation operators , and bob s photodiode detector feeds current blips into an audio amplifier so he hears and counts them . under what circumstances",
    "does counting blips give him a claim to say he counts photons ?",
    "alice and bob experiment with a transmitter and a receiver linked by an optical fiber , and their results agree with the predictions of a model in which it is proved they are secure against undetected eavesdropping using individual attacks .",
    "what use can they make of that proof ?",
    "we will show that quantum states are by no means ` plainly visible ' in the devices of experiments on quantum cryptography ; rather there is a gap , as pictured in figure 1 , between states as terms in equations and results recorded from devices on a laboratory bench . to show this gap and its bridging by guesswork",
    ", we will sketch a conceptual framework in section 2 , and then turn in section 3 to quantum cryptographic key distribution as an appealing arena for examples .",
    "cryptographers know that relying on a theory does not bind one s enemy to rely on the same theory .",
    "they know too",
    "that abstractions endemic to theories are likely targets for cryptographic attack , so they can well imagine that a proof of the security of quantum key distribution might not be the last word @xcite . by seeing gaps in physics where logic can not reach and guesses are indispensable , we will see both limitations to proofs of the security of quantum key distribution and opportunities to improve security .",
    "preliminary to showing how guesses bridge the gap between equations and experiments , we introduce the concept of a quantum mechanical model of an experimental trial ; we also attend to _ trial - to - trial management _ and introduce the _ envelopment of one model by another _ as a building block for sections [ sec:3 ] and [ sec:4].=-1      quantum mechanics provides language in which to write equations for various probabilities and to relate these equations logically to one another .",
    "proofs of qkd security apply equations for probabilities as models of devices expected to be used to communicate keys .",
    "quantum mechanical operators and state vectors are germane to qkd security only as they appear as components in equations that define probabilities in models that someone applies to actual or anticipated devices .    to test a model of qkd one",
    "subjects the devices to a run of experimental trials , each of which involves setting up devices and recording results . in order that trials of devices can test a model ,",
    "the model must speak of the devices , and for this the operators and state vectors must somehow be linked to these devices .    appreciating the need to link state vectors to devices",
    "requires you to resist a temptation . in planning a test of a model that involves quantum states , avoid picturing yourself ` in a hilbert space of these states , ' an intangible world disconnected from the world of prisms and fibers on a bench . instead ,",
    "look at how you can use quantum states in calculations . momentarily set aside the picture of state vectors as denizens of a hilbert - space world , and notice how you write characters for quantum states into a computer memory , preferably the memory of the same computer that manages the devices during a run of experimental trials .",
    "this puts your writing of quantum states and calculating with them into a common world with the handling of prisms and fibers .    that still leaves the problem of how to attach state vectors and operators , as terms in equations of a model , to devices in a laboratory .",
    "one goes half way by deciding to attach states and operators as terms in equations to various settings of the knobs and levers by which the devices are configured in a trial , to get state - valued functions and operator - valued functions of the knob and lever settings @xcite . to complete the attachment",
    ", one has to decide which device settings go with which states and operators .",
    "once accomplished , the attachment of the states and operators to device settings converts the usual quantum mechanical probabilities of outcomes for given states and operators to probabilities of outcomes for given device settings . with this trick one gets equations interpreted as asserting something about devices .",
    "the first kind of model to consider can be called a quantum - mechanical model of devices or , for short , qm - model . later we will use models of this type as a foundation on which to build some other kinds of models .",
    "a qm - model @xmath0 consists of a triple of functions that , in combination , generate probabilities of outcomes for various set - ups of devices . simplifying the full description given in appendix a",
    ", one can view these functions as follows .",
    "( 1 ) state preparation is expressed by a function @xmath1 from the domain of set - ups of devices to state vectors ; ( 2 ) evolution over a time duration is expressed by a function @xmath2 from the domain of set - ups of devices to unitary operators ; and ( 3 ) a measurement process that generates results is expressed by a function from set - ups of devices to operators , most generally in the form of a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) as a set of detection operators , one for each possible outcome , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this triple of functions generates probabilities of outcomes as a function of set - up , asserted by model @xmath0 , according to the usual rule : @xmath4 where the subscripts @xmath0 indicate that the functions to which they are attached are particular to model @xmath0 so another model would involve other functions .    analyzing the receipt of a cryptographic key from the standpoint of quantum mechanics ,",
    "one is interested in the question the other way around . given an outcome , bob ( or eve ) wants to know what state alice transmitted , a subject addressed by quantum decision theory via bayes rule @xcite .      in order to describe the set - up of devices sufficiently to prove the need for guesswork in choosing a model for qkd , we restrict ourselves to describing only a part of setting up that can be controlled by a classical digital process - control computer ( cpc )",
    "this part is described by the commands transmitted from the cpc to actuators internal to these devices .",
    "such commands call , for example , for a stepping motor to rotate a polarizer to a certain angle .",
    "the same cpc serves to record the writing of qm - models in which set - ups are expressed as cpc - commands and to execute quantum - mechanical calculations involving these models .",
    "( the proof of proposition  1 in section [ sec:3 ] assumes only that some choices of set - up can be cpc mediated , not that everything in setting up an experiment is cpc mediated . )",
    "as pictured in figure 2 , the cpc :    \\(1 ) provides an investigator with a display by which to experience results of trials reported by the devices to the computer ;    \\(2 ) gives the investigator a keyboard by which to operate the computer ;    \\(3 ) makes a record of what the investigator does ( such as entering equations into programs that , when executed , control the devices ) ; and    \\(4 ) ( in various ways ) allows feedback from the devices to modify the equations @xcite .",
    "section [ sec:3 ] presents examples in which devices are controlled jointly by alice , bob , and eve , each via a cpc ; in this case a ` command ' is taken to be the concatenation of commands from the three cpcs of alice , bob , and eve , respectively .",
    "in testing a qm - model against results of experimental trials , one tests the probability distribution calculated from the model against relative frequencies extracted from measured results .",
    "any such test of the probability distribution tests the triple of functions that define the model , but only in the combination of equation ( 1 ) ; one can not test any of the functions separately without assuming the others . in particular",
    ", one can not test quantum states independently of the other two functions . when the probabilities of a model @xmath0 are found to closely match relative frequencies of outcomes for the various settings used in a run of experimental trials of devices ,",
    "one can still ask what other models agree as well with the same relative frequencies .    to sharpen this question",
    "we define the first of two relations among qm - models . by restricting the set of commands of a qm - model to a subset ,",
    "one generates what can be called a restriction of the qm - model .",
    "when an experiment confirms a qm - model , it actually confirms , at most , the restriction of the qm - model to commands tested , and often these are a small subset of the commands of the model .",
    "suppose model @xmath0 is such a restriction , and that it generates probabilities that closely match the relative frequencies of a run of trials",
    ". then any model @xmath5 agrees with the experimental trials if and only if it agrees with this model @xmath0 .",
    "hence we want to know : what models other than model @xmath0 predict the same probabilities as does @xmath0 concerning the settings covered by @xmath6 ?",
    "( notice that this question is made possible by the attachment of states and operators to settings of devices . ) as we shall see , for any qm - model @xmath0 a large set of other qm - models , defined by a variety of triples of functions , produce the same probabilities for settings of @xmath6 . as a result ,",
    "a tight screening of probability distributions by experiments induces only a loose screening of state- and operator - valued functions .",
    "this looseness in the testability of quantum states limits the role of proofs in quantum cryptography .    to clarify this looseness",
    "we introduce the concept of an _ envelopment _ of one model by another .",
    "let @xmath7 be the set of outcomes for model @xmath0 .",
    "given two qm - models @xmath0 and @xmath5 , suppose there is a function @xmath8 from a subset of @xmath9 to @xmath10 , with the property of preserving probabilities in the sense that : @xmath11 we say such a function @xmath8 _ envelops",
    "_ @xmath0 by @xmath5 .",
    "an enveloping model @xmath5 need not preserve inner products of quantum states of model @xmath0 , and for this reason the inner products of quantum states can not be determined from experimental results without augmentation by guesswork . in the case to be discussed in section [ sec:3 ] ,",
    "there is no ` mixing ' by the mapping @xmath8 , which is to say there exist functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 such that @xmath14 , and the envelopment of model @xmath0 by model @xmath5 exhibits the provocative inequality : @xmath15 with implications for security shortly to be developed .",
    "for quantum key distribution using the protocols bb84 @xcite or b92 @xcite , published arguments for the security of the key @xcite assume a qm - model @xmath0 ( augmented by bayes rule ) , according to which , at each trial , alice s transmitter receives a command @xmath16 from some finite set of possible commands and ` prepares a unit state vector ' @xmath17 . in both early work that ignores noise and",
    "in later work that accounts for noise ( and invokes privacy amplification @xcite ) , claims of security assume that inner products of the ` unit state vectors ' that alice can transmit are experimentally verifiable without regard to what devices eve might invent .",
    "the argument is that , given suitable magnitudes of inner products @xmath18 , any snooping by eve disturbs alice s states in ways alice and bob can almost surely detect as an increase in the error rate in bob s reception or the rate of inconclusive outcomes @xcite or both ( when they compare notes publicly , at the sacrifice of some of the bits of the key ) .    to what extent can experimental results on devices confirm a model @xmath0 that , based on inner products , asserts security of qkd ?",
    "alice and bob need to be secure not just against an attack by snooping devices that they use when they play eve s part in red - blue exercises , but against all of the attacks , within some class , that a real eve might invent .",
    "are alice s inner products verifiably independent of eve s inventions ?    to claim experimental confirmation of the security implied by inner products of model @xmath0 is to claim that    1 .",
    "the probabilities calculated from model @xmath0 match closely the relative frequencies of experimental results , and 2 .",
    "no other qm - model ( say one with smaller inner products ) that challenges that security produces the same probabilities that match those relative frequencies .",
    "although attachments of models of quantum cryptography to actual devices have been questioned @xcite , the possibility of enveloping a model @xmath0 by a model @xmath5 having smaller inner products went unnoticed , with the consequence that the need to make the claim ( b)no model with smaller inner products fits the experimental results  also went unnoticed .",
    "the published arguments for security assume `` any attack that eve might invent '' is equivalent to `` any qm - model that eve might implement that has the inner products of model @xmath0 '' .",
    "thus the experimental confirmation of security depends on the notion that inner products are experimentally testable .",
    "the trouble is that , as shown in section [ sec:2 ] , experiments can not test states and their inner products _ per se _ but only the probabilities they generate . for example , suppose a run of experimental trials shows a close match to the probabilities of a qm - model @xmath0 that speaks of certain inner products @xmath19 . do these trials ` demonstrate ( _ e.g. _ single - photon ) states ' having these inner products ?",
    "the answer is `` _ no _ , '' because for any model @xmath0 there is always an envelopment by an alternative model @xmath5 that produces probabilities in agreement with @xmath0 concerning the experimental results that alice and bob have on hand , but generates these probabilities on the basis of different states with smaller inner products . because of its smaller inner products , the model @xmath5 points to something outside of model @xmath0 that , if eve can do it , allows her to eavesdrop undetected .      among widely used models of the security of quantum key distribution against undetected individual attacks",
    ", there are two cases to consider , corresponding to eve measuring alice s signal directly , or , using a probe , indirectly . deferring models of eve s use of a probe to appendix b",
    ", we consider an individual eavesdropping attack in which eve measures alice s signal and tries to transmit a signal to bob , aiming to match what would have come from alice .",
    "any model @xmath0 asserting security against this attack rests on an inner product for alice s possible states .",
    "we now show how to envelop model @xmath0 by a model @xmath5 having a smaller inner product but producing the same probabilities as model @xmath0 .",
    "the model @xmath0 assumes that the command set @xmath6 consists of concatenations of a command @xmath16 from alice to determine a state vector and a command @xmath20 from eve to select a povm .",
    "these commands produce alice s state vector @xmath21 , and eve s measurement expressed by a povm @xmath22 which has a detection operator @xmath23 acting on @xmath24 , associated with outcome @xmath25 .",
    "model @xmath0 implies that the conditional probability of eve obtaining the outcome @xmath25 given her command @xmath20 and alice s command @xmath16 is @xmath26 implying that the error rate for eve in distinguishing among alice s commands , asserted by model @xmath0 , depends on the inner products @xmath27 .",
    "* proposition 1 * 1em _ given any such model @xmath0 with inner products @xmath19 and given any @xmath28 , there is a model @xmath5 that gives the same conditional probabilities of eve s outcomes for all her commands belonging to @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 while @xmath31 _",
    "_ proof _ : motivated by the idea that , unknown to alice , her transmitter signal might generate an additional `` leakage '' into an unintended spurious channel that eve reads , we construct the following enveloping model @xmath5 which assumes :    1 .   the same set of commands for alice , 2 .   a larger hilbert space @xmath32 in which alice produces vectors @xmath33 , with @xmath34 ; 3 .   a larger set of commands for eve , @xmath35 ( disjoint union ) ; 4 .   a povm - valued function of eve s commands to her measuring instruments , with detection operators @xmath36    according to model @xmath5 , if eve chooses any measurement command of @xmath29 , equation ( [ eq : p_alpha ] ) holds .",
    "but model @xmath5 speaks not of the vectors @xmath37 but of other vectors having an inner product of magnitude @xmath38 we can choose the unit vectors @xmath39 at will ; in particular nothing excludes choosing them so that @xmath40 , @xmath41 , from which the proposition follows .",
    "@xmath42      models of the form of model @xmath5 with its @xmath43 thus match any data that match model @xmath0 while denying security of the key . given the two qm - models , @xmath0 and @xmath5 , that disagree about cryptographic security while agreeing about probabilities for commands of @xmath6 , one would like to decide between the conflicting models by an experiment .",
    "but , without guesswork , this is impossible , for the enveloping model @xmath5 is no description of instruments on hand ; instead , it is a picture of behavior that eve might try to achieve by inventing a snooping device not yet known . nor",
    "does model @xmath5 ( nor any qm - model ) say of itself how to implement it , because it speaks only of states and operators rather than of the prisms and optical fibers that one can find in a supply room .",
    "implementing model @xmath5 would require invention and discovery , such as gaining access to a channel carrying leakage states @xcite .",
    "for this reason there can be no positive experimental test of the inner products of quantum states , nor of claims of cryptographic security based on such inner products . indeed , to claim security against ` all the eavesdropping devices that eve might invent ' for individual attacks is to misuse the word ` all ' ; by confusing ` all devices ' described by a model @xmath0 with ` all the models ' consistent with experiments that accord with probabilities expressed by model @xmath0 .",
    "it is for this reason that the application of a model to actual devices takes guesswork .",
    "the notion that experiments can determine alice s inner products independent of eve s inventions is faulty , because it confuses experimental validation of probabilities , which is possible , with experimental validation of inner products of quantum states , which , as we have shown , is impossible to disentangle from guesswork .    in more practical terms , to experimentally confirm qkd security by ` seeing a single - photon state , '",
    "one must see the absence of correlated signals that accompany it , which eve might receive , and nothing in alice and bob s modeling and experiments can exclude a real eve from finding such a signal in a place alice and bob never thought to look , such as light emitted by alice s transmitter in a spurious frequency band @xcite .",
    "it is often advantageous to introduce feedback into a run of trials , using the outcome of one trial in setting up a next trial , as illustrated in figure 3 . by studying trial - to - trial adjustment brought about by feedback loops designed using qm - models",
    ", we will win fresh insight into the bridging of equations and devices of experimental trials .",
    "the typographical view of equation writing introduced in section [ sec:2 ] , with cpcs as equation holders , allows one to view a feedback loop as a special sort of device , a device containing an equation - holding cpc which a scientist uses to link equations of qm - models ( and other equations ) to operations of other devices .",
    "this picture opens up a place in theoretical physics in which to investigate trial - to - trial adjustment .    to define a feedback loop",
    ", a designer specifies a _ control function _ that maps results of completed trials and other records on hand to actions to be taken in response to these .",
    "the specification of the control function can make use of qm - models .",
    "but neither a qm - model nor a schrdinger equation expresses a place in which an outcome from one trial can enter to influence a state preparation at a subsequent trial ; on the contrary , trial - to - trial adjustments of devices take place in a space outside of qm - models , so to speak . to deal with feedback in a quantum context",
    ", one has to implant qm - models as components of larger models , which we call _ control _ models , which contain control functions that express how a cpc responds to outcomes .",
    "its need for feedback cements quantum physics into a classical environment of cpcs that command the devices and record the results .      in a feedback situation , cpcs that accompany other devices or are embedded in them are part of the experimental instrumentation , and so are their files housing the equations that define a control function .",
    "these files of equations are used not for analysis but to define actions of devices , which puts an end to any categorical distinction between equations and devices .",
    "this poses a question of just what one compares with what in an experimental trial , for one can not , in this situation , compare an ` equation as something unphysical ' against ` behavior of physical devices free of equations ' .",
    "one does , however , compare predictions calculated from a qm - model and other equations of a control model with experimental trials in which the same equations take part in programs of cpcs that control the devices . _",
    "i.e. _ , one compares a ` use of equations and guesses to make a prediction ' against ` behavior of devices controlled by cpcs programmed using the same equations ' ( and possibly other equations as well ) .",
    "quantum cryptography provides an arena for examples of trial - to - trial adjustments , pertaining to timing . in quantum key distribution ,",
    "bob s receiver is intended to detect a sequence of signals transmitted by alice .",
    "bob s receiver ( as well as eve s snooping devices ) depends on keeping in step with the signals of the sequence transmitted by alice . besides the need to correlate detections with alice s acts of transmission",
    ", there can be a need to gate a receiver off except in a narrow time interval around the arrival of each signal .",
    "keeping the receiver in step with the signals arriving from the transmitter requires one or another use of results of one trial to regulate the receiver timing for another trial .",
    "that is synchronization , an important form of trial - to - trial adjustment . for understanding synchronization",
    ", it is necessary to look for a quantum description of reception that describes a receiver only imperfectly timed .",
    "this leads us to the notion of a receiver that measures , or at least estimates , the time difference between the arrival of a signal and the gating of its detector , a time difference we call _",
    "skew_. for a quantum - mechanical model to express this additional distinction of temporal skew in detection , it has to allow for a larger variety of quantum states than did models @xmath0 and @xmath5 above , with the skew as an additional argument , which entails expanding the dimension of the hilbert space beyond that of model @xmath0 .    to glimpse an expanded model @xmath44 that envelops the model @xmath0 of section [ sec:3 ] , and that allows a designer to picture timing ,",
    "suppose a receiver is designed to expect the @xmath45-th signal at reading @xmath46 of its clock , and that the clock is fast by a _ skew _",
    "@xmath47 ; then the signal arrives not at clock reading @xmath46 but in a small interval around @xmath48 . to allow for skew",
    ", model @xmath44 must have a hilbert space @xmath49 , of dimension higher than that of @xmath24 ( if that is finite ) , along with states @xmath50 that are functions not only of alice s commands in @xmath51 , but also of the skew @xmath47 of bob s clock .",
    "we conclude that for model @xmath0 to accord with the behavior of an imperfectly synchronized receiver , there must be an envelopment @xmath8 of model @xmath0 by such a model @xmath44 with the property that : @xmath52    an interesting topic for future work is the elaboration of models such as @xmath44 and their application to more subtle forms of synchronization , with which alice and bob can advance their cause by making it more difficult for eve to make guesses necessary to eavesdropping . for example if alice and bob manage to synchronize of bob s receiver while alice transmits using a deliberately irregular clock rate , eve has a problem determining when to gate her snooping receiver .",
    "to base qkd security only on proofs is to forget the crucial point that proofs are purely mathematical .",
    "a proof of a proposition asserting security shows that the proposition , written as an equation , follows from assumptions by logic , without guesswork .",
    "prominent in the assumptions are inner products . in simple and rough terms , a proof of qkd security shows that if alice s transmitter is modeled by a certain inner product between two possible states , then the model says : ` any individual eavesdropping attack is detectable . ' but do we buy the assumption on which the conclusion of the model rests ? can one decide this by applying logic to experimental tests of the model ?",
    "more precisely , suppose relative frequencies of outcomes obtained in a run of experimental trials agree with the probabilities calculated from the inner products assumed in the model : do we then buy the model ?",
    "we have tried to avoid garbling logical connections within mathematics , on one hand , with the application of that mathematics to actual devices on the other . by analyzing not just a single model but a multiplicity of models ( all purely mathematical ) we made plain a security issue : for any experimental data on hand , more than one model can fit them perfectly , and among the models that fit the data are models with widely differing inner products .",
    "thus choosing one of these models while rejecting others requires reaching outside the measured data and the logic of models , as asserted by our proposition 1 .",
    "because inner products , central to qkd security , vary widely over those models that exactly fit the measured data , the measured data can not determine the value of the inner product . therefore the inner product is not measurable , and assuming that any model , with its inner products , applies to particular devices reaches beyond logic into the realm of guesswork .    like any proof , our proof of proposition 1 clarifies the effect of rules of logic .",
    "this proof escapes the question `` are we sensible to apply it to cryptography '' because we do not apply it to devices _ per se _ , but use it only to elucidate the logic of _ arguments _ about cryptography , arguments that , as it turns out , overlook choices of model that are apparent once the model that asserts security has been set in the context of a language game in which it competes with other models .",
    "the world of cryptography , as we have described it , is a multi - model world in which each side must guess to choose models that guide actions . by recognizing feedback , as in section 4 , we show choices of models , with their guesswork , that enter responses to experimental results , and",
    "hence enter the use of outcomes to manage experiments .",
    "records in the memory of a computer used in a feedback loop can reflect guesses within a structure of equations and devices . by introducing cpcs , with their capacity to mediate between a scientist and devices and to record guesses as choices of models used in device - controlling programs ,",
    "we make a beginning toward exploring the structure of guesswork in the bridging of equations to devices .    .",
    "we thank howard e. brandt for reading an early draft and giving us an astute critique , indispensable to this paper .",
    "we thank john lowry , donald nicholson , bahaa saleh , alexander sergienko , malvin teich , and tai t. wu for contributing substantially to this paper .",
    "this work was supported in part by the air force research laboratory and darpa under contract f30602 - 01-c-0170 with bbn technologies .",
    "to formally present _ qm - models _ and the enveloping of one by another , it is convenient to introduce a category having structures of equations of qm - models as its objects @xcite .",
    "we abuse language by calling these structures qm - models .",
    "any qm - model @xmath0 consists of : a domain @xmath6 of commands from cpcs ( which we interpret as commands that set up devices ) , a set of possible outcomes @xmath7 , a hilbert space @xmath24 , and a triple of functions , namely ( 1 ) @xmath53 , ( 2 ) @xmath54unitary operators on @xmath55 , and ( 3 ) @xmath56semipositive hermitian operators on @xmath55 , subject to the constraint that makes @xmath57 work as a positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) , namely that @xmath58 where the * 1 * denotes the identity operator on @xmath24 .",
    "the triple of functions defines a probability distribution on outcomes given the set - up @xmath59 by the rule @xmath60 in the examples in the paper , the state preparation expressed by @xmath61 depends only on a command and not on an outcome , as does the unitary transform @xmath62 ; in that case equation ( [ eq : rule ] ) becomes @xmath63 we remark that if the devices are controlled by more than one cpc , as is the case in cryptographic examples , then the command @xmath64 that specifies a set - up of devices is a composite of commands from the various cpcs .",
    "for example if the set - up is established by the three cpcs of alice , bob , and eve , respectively , a command @xmath64 has the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes concatenation of the commands from the three parties .",
    "the single set @xmath10 , which expresses the possibilities of set - ups of devices for a run of trials along with the possible outcomes , is the domain for all three functions that represent state preparation , evolution , and measurement .",
    "sometimes one wants to suppose that one device prepares a state , another device is responsible for evolution , and a third measures . by adding assumptions beyond those by which we defined a qm - model",
    ", one can generate a specialization of a qm - model that expresses such a notion , as if the function @xmath61 had a domain distinct from that of @xmath62 and @xmath57 .",
    "for example , one can specialize a qm - model so that the state @xmath67 depends only on @xmath16 and not on the commands @xmath68 and @xmath20 ( concatenated with it to form @xmath69 , nor on the outcome @xmath70 in @xmath7 .",
    "a function @xmath71 can always be written as a function @xmath61 on @xmath10 for which variation of the argument @xmath70 in @xmath7 makes no change in the value of the function , and similarly , variation in the @xmath20 and @xmath68 parts of @xmath64 make no change ; for this reason , we can ( and do ) look at a function @xmath72 of one variable as a special case of the function @xmath67 of two variables . a reason to formulate all three functions with the more general domain @xmath10 is that , as discussed in @xcite , the supposition that one device prepares a state independent of other devices is unprovable ; it is introducible only as an additional assumption .",
    "in addition , including the @xmath7 factor in the domain of @xmath73 allows the modeling of randomness in state preparation .    given two models @xmath0 and @xmath5 of the category , a _ morphism _ from @xmath5 to @xmath0 is defined by a function @xmath8 from a subset ( not necessarily proper ) of @xmath9 to @xmath10 , with the property of preserving probabilities in the sense that : @xmath74    given such a morphism , qm - model @xmath5 will be said to _ envelop _ qm - model @xmath0 , and the morphism will be called an _",
