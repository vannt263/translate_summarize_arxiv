    "moreover , there are reasons to believe that the present day half - light radii are faithful records of the characteristic sizes of the proto - gc clouds ; thus , measurements of half - light radii provide unique constraints on the properties of the gcs at the time of their formation ( murray & lin 1992 ) .    until recently",

    "van den bergh , morbey & pazder ( 1991 ) found a scaling relation of the form @xmath11 based on an analysis of 98 galactic gcs .",

    "an interesting result to emerge from these studies is the realization that the half - light radii of metal - rich gcs in luminous early - type galaxies appear to be @xmath13 smaller than those of their metal - poor counterparts  a finding that has alternatively been interpreted as the result of projection effects ( larsen & brodie 2003 ) or the combined effects of mass - segregation and the dependence of stellar lifetimes on metallicity under the assumption that their half - mass radius is constant ( jordn 2004 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the fields of view have been typically too small to explore possible dependencies of @xmath0 on projected @xmath10 ; only in one galaxy ( ngc 4365 ) has a clear increase of @xmath0 with projected @xmath10 been found in the outermost regions ( larsen et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the prospects for using the sizes of gcs for distance estimation dates back at least to the work of shapley & sawyer ( 1927 ) , who state that `` measures of diameter [ of gcs ] are chiefly useful in the determination of relative distances '' .",

    "as mentioned in  1 , gc half - light radii are believed to reflect the physical conditions of the proto - gc clouds at the time of their formation .",
    "thus , any systematic variations in half - light radius can provide potentially powerful insights into the mechanism(s ) of gc and galaxy formation .",
    "the various factors that can , in principle , affect the half - light radii of gcs can be naturally divided into factors that change @xmath0 individually in each gc , factors that affect the gc system _ within _ a galaxy , and factors that change it _ across _ galaxies . in",
    "what follows , we shall refer to these factors as _",
    "internal _ , _ local _ and _ global _ factors .",
    "the variables we will use to parameterize internal effects are the gc colors , @xmath70 , and @xmath6-band magnitudes .",
    "local factors will be parameterized using the variables @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the effective radius obtained from our isophotal analysis ( ferrarese et  al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) , and the underlying @xmath6-band surface brightness of the galaxy , @xmath73 , at the position of each gc .",
    "note that @xmath73 is preferred over its @xmath17-band counterpart because it is a better tracer of the underlying stellar mass and is less sensitive to dust obscuration .",
    "finally , global parameters are taken to be the absolute blue magnitude of the host galaxy , @xmath74 , and its corresponding color , @xmath75 ( binggeli , sandage & tammann 1985 ; ct et  al .",
    "2004 ; ferrarese et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "we use our sbf distance moduli ( mei et  al .",
    "2005bc ) to calculate absolute magnitudes on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis .",
    "many of these properties are highly correlated , so the extraction of the intrinsic dependence on each of them is not entirely straightforward .",
    "for example , not only are @xmath74 and @xmath75 correlated , but both quantities are themselves correlated with the mean color of the gc systems and the fraction of gcs which belong to the metal - rich component ( with brighter and redder systems having a higher fraction of metal - rich gcs ; e.g. , peng et  al .",
    "moreover , the dependence of the average half - light radius , @xmath2 , on @xmath70 ( see below ) will affect the inferred dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath73 through differing proportions of metal - rich and metal - poor gcs as a function of radius : i.e. , red and blue gcs are often found to have different spatial distributions , with the latter having a more extended spatial distribution ( kissler - patig et  al .",

    ", we actually calculate its value using the biweight location estimator ( beers et  al .",
    "likewise , the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath70 will also influence the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath74 , as more luminous galaxies have redder gc systems .",
    "our approach will therefore be to first isolate the various dependencies ( i.e. , internal , local and global ) on environment , and then to  correct \" the observed @xmath0 so that subsequent correlations are unaffected the preceeding dependencies .",
    "we will indicate the successively corrected half - light radii by adding primes ( i.e. , @xmath76 ) and will denote the final corrected @xmath0 ( in which all environmental dependencies have been accounted for ) with a hat : @xmath77",
    ". our goals in this portion of the analysis are twofold .",
    "first , the individual correlations hold potentially important clues to the processes of gc formation and evolution (   [ sec : th ] ) . and second , we will show that  once the various dependencies on gc color , galaxy color and underlying surface brightness are taken into account  @xmath78 is remarkably constant across our sample , and thus appears to be a promising  standard ruler \" for distance estimation (   [ sec : distance ] ) .",
    "one of the most remarkable properties of gcs is that their size appear to be independent of their mass : i.e. , studies of the galactic gc system show that @xmath79 ( mclaughlin 2000 ) .",
    "in fact , this relation is equivalent to one of the defining equations of the `` fundamental plane '' of gcs , namely , that gc binding energy scales with luminosity as @xmath80 ( mclaughlin 2000 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : rhz ] , we show @xmath0 versus @xmath6-band magnitude for our sample of gcs .",
    "a regresssion analysis shows that the linear coefficient in the function @xmath81 is not significant for this sample , meaning that , as expected , gc radii in the acsvcs are independent of luminosity .",
    "we have also performed fits of this same functional form for all galaxies individually .",

    "it is apparent that , across the factor of 350 in luminosity spanned by our sample galaxies , there is no evidence for a variation in the gc size with luminosity . it should be noted that this statement applies only to those clusters brighter than the turnover of the gc luminosity function ( @xmath82 ) due to the construction of the sample . to the extent that the @xmath6-band luminosity reflects gc mass , this finding provides strong evidence that @xmath79 .    on the other hand , previous _",

    "while requiring the gcs to lie in a restricted range of color will not , in principle , entirely eliminate any dependency , it will certainly reduce it to a very small level .",

    "to quantify variations of @xmath119 with color , we must have enough gcs in any given color bin to get an accurate measure of the mean behavior .",

    "the motivation for this condition is that adding galaxies which have purely metal - poor gc systems adds no information to the characterization of the @xmath119 color dependence ; indeed , because of uncertainties in the measured distances , such galaxies would add scatter only in the blue population while contributing few or no red gcs .",
    "figure  [ fig : gzrh ] shows the resulting gc samples , which in some cases consist of a single galaxy .",
    "also shown are the best - fit linear relations , @xmath124 ( transformed to @xmath119 ) , the median values of @xmath119 in bins of @xmath125 along with their 99% confidence intervals , and a model from jordn ( 2004 ) with central potential , which is the gravitational potential at the center of the cluster normalized by a characteristic velocity variance .",
    "a value of @xmath126 is comparable to a value of @xmath127 for the concentration of a single - mass isotropic king ( 1966 ) model , with the concentration increasing with @xmath128 . ]",
    "@xmath126 , normalized such that the model at [ fe / h]@xmath129 coincides with the median @xmath119 at @xmath130 mag .",
    "it is apparent that the @xmath119 show a significant correlation with @xmath70 for all of the subsamples in figure  [ fig : gzrh ] . except for the group of bluer galaxies shown in the bottom left panel ,",
    "the behavior is very consistent , with    @xmath131    valid in the range @xmath132 .",
    "the bluer bin shows a somewhat shallower behavior , with a slope of @xmath133 , but still within @xmath134 of the mean behavior of the redder galaxies . because the bluer bin required 25 galaxies for its construction ,",
    "it is much more prone to uncertainties arising from errors in the measured distances .",
    "futhermore , these galaxies contain few red gcs , so their usefulness in probing the relation between @xmath119 and @xmath70 is limited .",
    "we will therefore assume that the behavior exhibited by galaxies with @xmath135 is valid universally , and will use this relation to perform the final correction of the gc half - light radii ( see below ) .",
    "it is remarkable how well a single model from jordn ( 2004 ) , with @xmath126 , does in matching the data in figure  [ fig : gzrh ] . with the possible exception of the bin containing the bluest galaxies",
    ", it reproduces the observed trends very well . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , only two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed tendency for red gcs to be smaller than their blue counterparts .",
    "larsen & brodie ( 2003 ) proposed that this effect could be the consequence of projection effects , combined with the differing spatial distributions of the red and blue gcs .",
    "the red gcs are observed to be more centrally concentrated so that , if the gcs follow a relationship between galactocentric distance and @xmath2 which is similar to that of gcs in the milky way , projection effects can lead to the red gcs appearing systematically smaller ( due to the fact that they are , on average , physically closer to the galaxy center ) .",
    "as noted by larsen & brodie ( 2003 ) , however , this mechanism requires some fine - tuning to work .",
    "jordn ( 2004 ) , on the other hand , has proposed that the observed size difference can be explained as the consequence of mass segregation within individual gcs , combined with the dependence of stellar lifetimes on metallicity .",
    "simply stated , if the half-_mass _ radii are assumed to be independent of metallicity , the half-_light _ radii will , at fixed age , differ because the brightest stars , which dominate the overall light profile , will be more massive in red ( metal - rich ) gcs and thus more centrally concentrated .",
    "we can use our new measurements to discriminate between these alternatives .",
    "first , we note that our observations point to a significantly shallower relation between @xmath0 and galactocentric radius in early - type galaxies than the one observed in our galaxy .",
    "this latter relation was assumed by larsen & brodie ( 2003 ) and is necessary for the projection mechanism to explain the observed trend .",
    "using shallower relations they found that projection effects are unable to reproduce the observed size difference .",
    "thus , our measurements seem to rule out projection effects as the primary mechanism responsible for the observed difference , although it is certainly possible that they play some part in its origin .",
    "in addition , the importance of projection effects is expected to depend on the fraction of the galaxy surveyed , as they are expected to decrease strongly beyond one effective radius of the gc system , and to disappear entirely as @xmath136 ( larsen & brodie 2003 ) .",
    "the galaxies with @xmath135 span an enormous range in @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the upper radii for inclusion of gcs in each galaxy and @xmath72 is the effective radius of the galaxy light .",
    "these galaxies have @xmath139 , with a median of @xmath140 and an interquartile range of @xmath141 . that the observed difference in @xmath0 is observed to be nearly identical among these galaxies argues strongly for a mechanism that is independent of projection effects .",
    "it might be argued that the fact that the decrease in size seems to be milder for the bluest galaxies is consistent with at least some variation due to projection effects .",
    "but the distribution of @xmath137 for the galaxies in the bluest bin is not extremely different from those in the redder ones , having @xmath142 , a median of @xmath143 and an interquartile range of @xmath144 .",
    "thus , it would be fortuitous that the change of regime occurs between samples with median @xmath137 of @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the mechanism of jordn ( 2004 ) seems to fare better , despite the fact that it is a clear oversimplification to compare the data with a single model with @xmath126 . in reality",
    ", gcs will span a range in @xmath128 , and there could well exist a systematic difference in the average central potential of gcs belonging to the blue ( low - luminosity ) galaxies .",
    "as we show in figure  [ fig : gzrh ] , a model with @xmath147 for the bluer bin is able to reproduce the observations quite well . in any case , the overall conclusion to be drawn from the data in figure  [ fig : gzrh ] is that , whatever is responsible for the size difference between red and blue gcs does , this difference does not seem to arise mainly from projection effects but is instead the result of some property intrinsic to the gcs .",
    "having systematically explored the variations in half - light radii with a number of internal , local , and global factors , we now use the observed dependencies to correct the individual @xmath0 measurements to the expected value for a gc with color @xmath148  mag , at an underlying surface brightness of @xmath108 mag  arecsec@xmath8 , in a galaxy with @xmath5 mag . in other words , we assume that only the mean of the @xmath0 distribution is changing to the above scaling relations , so that the corrected radii , @xmath77 , are given by    @xmath149 + 0.17[(g - z)-1.2]}. \\label{eq1}\\ ] ]    we plot @xmath150 for our sample galaxies , in both arcseconds and parsecs , against @xmath70 and @xmath74 in figure  [ fig : rhcor ] .",
    "it is clear that @xmath150 is remarkably constant across our sample galaxies . as such",
    ", this quantity appears to be a  standard ruler \" , suitable for use as an extragalactic distance indicator .",
    "we shall explore this issue in more detail in  [ sec : distance ] .",
    "we emphasize that none of the dependencies discussed above are likely to be due to selection effects .",
    "compact clusters at large galactocentric radii ( or , equivalently , at low surface brightness ) would be readily detected and measured in our survey .",
    "the inner radial cut imposed on each galaxy ensures that we are highly complete for extended gcs .",
    "the decrease in @xmath111 with galaxy color could be suspected to be due to contamination preferentially affecting the small gc systems of faint , blue galaxies .",
    "however , we have accurate estimates of the expected contamination measured directly from our control fields ( peng et  al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) so this is unlikely to be the case .",
    "while from an observational point of view , the local and global factors can be separated naturally , they could in principle arise from a single relation which determines @xmath0 . as a simple illustration ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath0 is related to the surface mass density , @xmath151 , through the relation @xmath152^{-x}$ ] , where @xmath153 denotes the galaxy surface brightness and @xmath154 its mass - to - light ratio .",
    "clearly , in this case    @xmath155    the mass - to - light ratio will vary systematically with both the galaxy luminosity and color .",
    "taking @xmath156 from cappellari et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we get    @xmath157    where we have used the fact that @xmath158 . under this simple hypothesis",
    ", a value of @xmath159 would be a reasonable description of the observations ( cf . eqs 4 and 8) .",
    "this simple example serves to show that empirical trends can guide our theoretical understanding of both gc formation and galactic structure .",
    "we will now explore the implications of the observed global behavior for models which make quantitative predictions regarding the half - light radii of gcs and their dependence on environment .",
    "our finding that the half - light radii of gcs show clear correlations with some properties of their host galaxies should not obscure the remarkable fact that over a factor of @xmath160 in galaxy luminosity , @xmath2 varies by only @xmath161 ( after accounting for internal and local factors ) .",
    "clearly , one could assume that , to first order , @xmath2 is constant : @xmath162 .",
    "thus , our results demonstrate that any paradigm for the formation of gcs should predict an exponent @xmath163 in the relation @xmath164 which is very close to zero . in this section",
    ", we show that two possible hypothesis for the origin of the observed @xmath0 of gcs do lead to roughly this result .",
    "it should be stressed at the onset , however , that the level of theoretical understanding we have on process of gc formation is sketchy at best .",
    "indeed , the observations are far ahead , in the sense that they provide an increasingly clear , albeit sometimes puzzling , set of constraints to which any theory of gc formation must conform .",
    "it has been suggested that the half - light radii of gcs reflect the structure of self gravitating proto - gc clouds which , at the time of gc formation , were in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding gas .",
    "the structure of such clouds has been calculated by mclaughlin & pudritz ( 1996 ) , who determine that their limiting radius satisfies the relation @xmath165 ( cf .",
    "equation 2.11 in mclaughlin & pudritz 1996 ) , where @xmath166 is the pressure of the ambient gas .",
    "if we posit that the average @xmath0 observed today is linearly related to @xmath167 , then it follows that @xmath168 , where we assume that gcs of differing masses that form at approximately the same radius in a galaxy come from clouds with differing velocity dispersions .",
    "it is immediately apparent that this hypothesis is in strong conflict with observations due to the factor @xmath169 .",
    "the observational evidence presented in  3 argues for @xmath170 . to resolve this discrepancy",
    "one might propose that the star formation efficiency scales as some power of the proto - gc cloud binding energy ( e.g. , ashman & zepf 2001 ) .",
    "while such a scaling relation could , in principle , erase the mass dependence , there is no physical basis to justify such a scaling . in any case",
    ", we will carry on by supposing that a mechanism exists to render this pressure support picture viable , and examine what this scenario predicts for the global behavior of @xmath2 with host galaxy luminosity .",
    "we begin by supposing that @xmath171 .",
    "if the ambient pressure is distributed like the dark matter , then averaging over an entire galaxy gives    @xmath172    where @xmath173 and @xmath174 are the virial mass and virial radius of the dark halo .",
    "we assume now that early - type galaxies all formed at similar large redshifts .",
    "the halos should then have the same average density , or @xmath175 .",
    "since the circular velocity at the virial radius is given by @xmath176 , we have then that @xmath177 and therefore we expect @xmath178 .    in order to progress further , we assume now that the dark matter halos are described by nfw profiles ( navarro , frenk & white 1995 ) . then the circular velocity @xmath179 profile is    @xmath180 ^ 2 =   \\frac{1}{x}\\frac{\\ln ( 1+cx)-cx/(1+cx)}{\\ln ( 1+c ) - c/(1+c)},\\ ] ]    where @xmath181 and @xmath182 is the concentration parameter .",
    "this velocity profile implies a peak circular velocity at radius @xmath183 , at which point the value is    @xmath184\\ ] ]    where the second approximation is accurate to within @xmath32 in the range @xmath185 .",
    "furthermore , simulations show ( bullock et  al .",
    "2001 ) that @xmath186 and thus @xmath187 .",
    "therefore , @xmath2 is related to the peak circular velocity of the halo through    @xmath188    finally , ferrarese ( 2002 ) connects @xmath189 to the _ stellar _ velocity dispersion of the central bulge by    @xmath190    and the faber - jackson relation has @xmath191 so ultimately    @xmath192    note that a scaling relation of the form of equation  [ eq : press ] can also be obtained much more simply by assuming that @xmath193 , and as consequence @xmath194 and @xmath195 . in both cases , we get a very mild dependence of @xmath2 with @xmath196 , albeit stronger than that which is observed .",
    "we note that if we had assumed that the average ambient pressure of the proto - gc clouds comes from gas distributed as the present - day starlight and used fundamental plane scaling relations , we would get a similar dependence but of opposite sign .",
    "that is to say , in this case we would posit    @xmath197    where @xmath72 is the effective radius of the galaxy light .",
    "the galactic fundamental plane scalings of @xmath198 and @xmath199 ( haegan et  al . 2005 and references therein ) then give @xmath200 .",
    "overall , it seems fair to conclude that the pressure hypothesis predicts roughly @xmath201 , in accord with the observations from  3 .",
    "an alternative hypothesis is that the half - light radii of gcs are proportional to their tidal radii , @xmath202 .",
    "this runs immediately into the problem of the non - homologous nature of gcs .",
    "in fact , the king concentration parameter @xmath182 is correlated with the gc mass through the rough relation @xmath203 , which could be the reflection of an original `` fundamental line '' ( mclaughlin 2000 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 in a king model is a function of @xmath182 times @xmath202 so that , via the dependence of @xmath182 on @xmath204 , it follows that a simple proportionality between @xmath0 and @xmath202 for all gcs can not be appropriate .",
    "also , there is no clear mechanism to physically transmit the information from the tidal regions to determine the half - light radius .",
    "finally , if the @xmath202 are determined by the tidal field of the host galaxy , then we would have @xmath205 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "thus , we would need to identify a mechanism that erases the mass dependence as in the pressure hypothesis above .",
    "assuming that such a mechanism exists , what would this hypothesis predict for the global behavior ? in this case @xmath2 should be related to the mean density of the galaxy s dark matter halo , or @xmath206 therefore , this picture would also predict a roughly constant @xmath2 across galaxies .",
    "it is interesting that both hypotheses predict roughly the observed global behavior .",
    "we conclude that the current observations can not discriminate between these two scenarios .",
    "indeed , the observational constraints seem to be ahead of what our limited knowledge of gc formation can predict , although it is clear that fundamental aspects of gc formation are encoded in them .",
    "in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : distance ] , we plot @xmath2 in arcseconds versus inverse distance , @xmath207 , for those galaxies in our sample with sbf distance measurements ( mei et  al .",
    "if @xmath2 is constant in physical units , then we expect @xmath208 at low redshift ( the dashed line ) .",
    "although the vast majority of our sample galaxies are located at very nearly the same distance ( i.e. , the mean virgo cluster distance of @xmath209 mpc ; mei et  al .",
    "2005c ) , two galaxies in our sample give us some additional leverage to test this idea : ( 1 ) vcc  731 ( ngc  4365 ) is a member of the virgo w cloud ( de vaucouleurs 1961 ) and has an sbf distance of @xmath2100.6 mpc ( mei et  al .",
    "2005c ) ; and ( 2 ) ngc  4697 , a non - member of the virgo cluster which lies in the foreground , with an sbf distance of 11.3@xmath2110.5 mpc ( tonry et  al . 2001 ; mei et  al",
    ". 2005c ) .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with our new measurement of 11.3 mpc . ]",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : distance ] reveals a scaling of @xmath2 with @xmath212 which has roughly the expected form , albeit with appreciable scatter for some of the fainter virgo members .",
    "note , however , that the half - light radii plotted in this panel have not been corrected for any dependence on gc or host galaxy properties as discussed in  3 . in the bottom panel of this figure",
    ", we plot the average corrected half - light radii , @xmath78 , against inverse distance .",
    "the dashed line , @xmath213 , is drawn so that @xmath78 has a value of @xmath214 at our adopted mean distance of virgo ( mei et  al .",
    "note that line is _ not _ a fit , although it accurately predicts the measured @xmath78 for both vcc  731 and ngc  4697 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath78 has the potential to be a powerful standard ruler for distance estimation .",
    "but as the upper panel of figure  [ fig : distance ] shows , even without any correction the directly measured @xmath2 can be a useful distance indicator when restricted to the luminous galaxies ( a class to which both vcc  731 and ngc  4697 belong ) . and trading some accuracy for simplicity",
    ", the mild nature of the required corrections means that a directly measured @xmath2 can give a rough distance measurement for any early - type galaxy .",
    "it should be noted that at least two other galaxies in the acsvcs have celestial positions close to the w cloud : vcc  571 and vcc  575 . while they do not have enough gcs remaining after the selection process described in   [ sec : obs ] to be included in our sample ( they are left with just 3 gcs each ) , their measured @xmath78 are nevertheless consistent with membership in the w cloud .",
    "more specifically , vcc  571 has @xmath215 , while vcc  575 has @xmath216 .",
    "an sbf distance is available only for vcc  575 , which confirms that it is at a similar distance as vcc  731 .",
    "while the number of gcs used to measure @xmath78 for vcc  575 is indeed low , it is reassuring that its measured value is consistent with it being at the distance of the w cloud ( @xmath217 mpc ) , lending additional support to the validity of using @xmath78 as a distance indicator .",
    "the position in the sky and the measured @xmath78 for vcc  571 suggest that it is indeed a member of the w cloud .",
    "we now put forward the following method and calibration for the use of gc half - light radii in distance estimation .",
    "if a set of @xmath218 are measured on a given galaxy they should first be individually corrected for their color , underlying surface brightness and the host galaxy color by computing @xmath219 according to equation  [ eq1 ] .",
    "the surface brightness can be measured from the same frame where the gcs are detected and analyzed , and all of the quantities needed to perform the correction are distance independent . then ,",
    "if the median of the @xmath219 is @xmath78 in arcseconds , the distance in mpc follows from    @xmath220    where the uncertainty reflects the uncertainty in the assumed mean virgo distance and the psf systematics .",
    "while the expression above is in principle applicable to any early - type galaxy within the color / luminosity range spanned by our sample galaxies [ i.e. , @xmath221 and @xmath222 , in practice this technique would be applied almost exclusively to luminous giants which have populous gc systems , and where large samples of gcs can be easily accumulated and contamination is less of an issue .",
    "additionally , in equation  [ eq1 ] measurements of the @xmath125 colors for the gc and galaxy are required , which would entail observing in these same bandpasses or transforming the color in hand to @xmath125 , which would add some uncertainty .",
    "needless to say , this also means that observations in at least two bands are needed to perform the correction .",
    "thus , we note that for luminous galaxies ( i.e. , those with @xmath223 mag ) a distance may be obtained without the benefit of color information by correcting the set of @xmath224 with the following approximation to equation  [ eq1 ] :    @xmath225    the distance then follows by applying equation  [ eq2 ] . the additional uncertainty incurred by this approximation",
    "if applied to a giant elliptical can be estimated to be of order a few percent .",
    "of course @xmath74 wo nt be known beforehand and it would not be possible to know if the approximation is valid . in practice , this complication can be circumvented by applying the method only to the @xmath23 brightest early - type members of a given galaxy cluster .",
    "what accuracy can be expected from this method ?",
    "the rms deviation from a constant value @xmath226 among our virgo galaxies is @xmath227 ( where vcc  731 has been excluded ) .",
    "thus , a single measurement can be expected to give a distance with external accuracy of @xmath228 .",
    "it is interesting to see that using our sample of @xmath78 we can already set an _",
    "upper _ limit to the depth of virgo ( once again , excluding the background w cloud ) .",
    "assuming that @xmath78 is strictly constant and neglecting observational uncertainties , the observed dispersion translates into a distance dispersion of @xmath229 mpc , or a 1-@xmath9 line - of - sight _ depth _ of 3.4  mpc . while this finding is in good agreement with several previous measurements of the depth of virgo around m87 ( e.g. , west & blakeslee 2000 , neilsen & tsvetanov 2000 , jerjen et  al .",
    "2004 ) , it effectively rules out the claim of young & currie ( 1995 ) that the virgo cluster has a very elongated distribution ( extending from @xmath12 8 - 20 mpc ) along the line of sight .",
    "thus , this approach complements previous evidence against this claim from sbf measurements ( jerjen et  al .",
    "2004 ; mei et  al .",
    "2005c ) .      up to now",
    "we have relied on our sbf distance measurements to establish the physical size of gcs in virgo and to provide a calibration for the use of half - light radius as a distance indicator .",
    "being reliant on sbf means that our distance measurement method is tied to the primary calibrators of the sbf method itself , and in particular to the calibration of the cepheids . in this section ,",
    "we calibrate the method using the milky way gc system only , thereby providing a simple geometric calibration of the method which is largely independent of any other extragalactic distance measurement method .",
    "first , we note that all of the dependencies used above to compute corrected radii , @xmath219 , are independent of our sbf distances .",
    "thus , we keep the form of these dependencies intact and attempt derive the zeropoint for the physical size using the milky way gc system . of course , this approach faces has the difficulty of estimating the parameters needed for the corrections for the milky way , and the complication that our galaxy is a disk system as opposed to the early - type galaxies targeted in the acsvcs .",
    "these caveats notwithstanding , we now estimate a rough zeropoint to provide a direct calibration .    the quantities needed to determine @xmath78 for galactic gcs are the @xmath125 colors of the gcs and the galaxy itself , and the surface brightness profile in @xmath6 . instead of working with the latter , we choose to use @xmath230 , where for the effective radius we adopt the value given by de vaucouleurs & pence ( 1978 ) , @xmath231 kpc",
    "we then use the harris ( 1996 ) catalog of galactic gcs to obtain the @xmath0 , [ fe / h ] and galactocentric distances @xmath101 . in order to estimate their @xmath125 colors , which are not directly available",

    "while this calibration should be viewed with some caution ( being based on a late - type galaxy for which we do not have a direct measurement of its global characteristics ) , it is comforting to see that the distance of virgo is in good agreement with other methods .",
    "moreover , because this estimate circumvents several of the problematic issues involved in other methods used to establish virgo s distance , such as the metallicity dependence of the period - luminosity relation for cepheid variables and the distance modulus to the large magellanic cloud , it provides a largely independent confirmation of the cepheid / sbf distances .",
    "so far we have examined only the dependencies and properties of a location parameter of the distribution of gc half - light radii in early - type galaxies .",
    "in fact , in applying the various corrections to the set of @xmath224 , we have tacitly assumed that only @xmath2 was changing and that the _ shape _ of the @xmath0 distribution is invariant .",

    "the distribution is noticeably skewed , with an excess on the right side of the peak .",
    "we emphasize that the distributions shown in figure  [ fig : rhdist ] are rather uncertain for @xmath241  pc , as the measurements in that regime begin to suffer from biases to slightly larger @xmath0 , due to the fact that the gcs are close to being unresolved .",
    "this difficulty notwithstanding , the decline toward small @xmath0 is certainly real .",
    "unfortunately , the data do not allow us to characterize the regime @xmath241  pc accurately , so the following discussion should be taken to apply to the range @xmath242 pc only .",
    "note that the upper radius is imposed by our sample selection ; in practice , this limit is set by the difficulty of distinguishing extended gcs from background galaxies .",

    ", there appears to be no sudden upturn in the distribution for @xmath241  pc or @xmath243  pc ( see , e.g. , figure  12 of haegan et  al .",
    "2005 ) , so it is clear that the bulk of the distribution lies in the regime accesible to us .",
    "we have devised an analytical distribution function @xmath244 with four parameters which is able to describe the observed distribution of @xmath238 , such that the probability of finding a gc with @xmath238 in an interval of width @xmath245 around @xmath77 is given by @xmath246 .",
    "the form of this function is @xmath247 where    @xmath248,\\ ] ]    @xmath249 , @xmath250 and @xmath251 can be derived as the distribution of extreme values for independent identically distributed random variables .",
    "while this fact might hold some clue as to the physical basis for the observed distribution , we use it here strictly as a statistical modelling function without an _ a priori _ physical justification . ] .",
    "the equivalent form of this distribution in terms of @xmath77 , such that the probability of finding a gc with @xmath77 in an interval @xmath252 around @xmath77 is given by @xmath253 , is @xmath254    where    @xmath255^{-1/\\tilde{\\beta } } \\exp ( -(x/\\tilde{\\mu})^{-1/\\tilde{\\beta}}),\\ ] ]    @xmath256 , @xmath257 and the parameters @xmath258 are related to the ones in @xmath244 by the relations @xmath259 , @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "these functions satisfy @xmath262 .",
    "we have obtained the best - fit parameters @xmath263 and @xmath264 via maximum - likelihood for the various subsamples shown in figure  [ fig : rhdist ] as well as for the combined sample of gcs . the resulting functions , convolved with a gaussian with @xmath265 in order to faithfully compare them with the density estimates , are shown in figure  [ fig : rhdist ] with a thick dashed curve .",
    "the function is able to produce a close match to the observed distributions .",
    "the maximum - likelihood parameters obtained for each galaxy subsample are fairly consistent with the parameters inferred for the combined sample of all galaxies .",
    "this is true despite the fact that uncertainties arising from the effect of distance uncertainties in combining the @xmath237 values for several galaxies are not included in the formal error estimates .",
    "the parameters for the combined sample , with uncertainties reflecting the dispersion of the values inferred for all galaxy color bins , are @xmath266 and @xmath267 we conclude that the observed distribution of @xmath77 is well represented by single distributions of the form    @xmath268    or , equivalently ,    @xmath269    we now examine the applicability of the proposed function to the case of the galactic gc system . in figure",
    "[ fig : mwrhdist ] we show a gaussian kernel density estimate with @xmath270 of the distribution of @xmath271 for all gcs in our galaxy satisfying @xmath272 pc and @xmath102 mag , along with the 99% confidence bands .",
    "the individual @xmath224 have been corrected as described in ",
    "[ sec : distance ] .",
    "we also show the best - fit form of @xmath244 shown in equation  [ eq : bf ] and convolved with a gaussian with @xmath273 as a dashed curve . without any adjustment",
    "the form of the @xmath77 distribution determined from our sample of early - type galaxies is able to reproduce satisfactorily the form observed in the milky way although the mean value is differs slightly .",
    "the dash - dotted curve shows the same curve after setting @xmath274 , and shows a very good agreement .",
    "this exercise supports the flexibility of the proposed form for describing the gc size distributions in galaxies of widely different mass and morphological type .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that we have only modelled the _ observed _ distribution of @xmath77 , which is the convolution of the intrinsic distribution with the error distribution .",
    "if the measurement uncertainties are large compared to the width of the underlying distribution , then the observed distribution might be telling us more about the measurement errors than the actual distribution of @xmath237 .",
    "however , as noted in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] , the typical random uncertainties for our sample are of order @xmath275 or @xmath276 pc at the mean distance of virgo , with the systematic uncertainties estimated to be of the same order .",
    "the magnitude of the errors will thus affect the width of the observed peak to some extent , although the extended , high-@xmath237 tail will be largely unaffected .    to investigate the effect of random uncertainties in a more quantitative way",
    ", we have taken the best - fit function of the form of equation  [ eq : jt ] for vcc1316 ( m87=ngc  4486 ) and determined the best match , via least squares , of a function with this same form but convolved with a normal distribution with @xmath277 pc in order to simulate the effect of the errors .",
    "the use of a single galaxy for this comparison ensures that we consider only random uncertainties : i.e. , we are probing only the shape of the distribution , and not the absolute value of its location parameter .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhdistconv ] shows the result of this exercise .",
    "this figure demontrates that the inferred intrinsic distribution shares the same features as the one after convolution , suggesting that the observed distribution is indeed revealing intrinsic properties .",
    "additionally , the fact that @xmath244 also provides a close match to the galactic data , which has a completely independent error distribution , further shows that the form of @xmath244 traces the intrinsic properties of the @xmath237 distribution .",
    "strictly speaking , the above analysis has relied on gcs that are brighter than the peak of the gc luminosity function , so our results apply in that regime only .",
    "while it is reasonable to expect the distribution to apply to the less luminous gcs , this claim needs to be tested . indeed ,",
    "if we considered all galactic gcs in figure  [ fig : mwrhdist ] , then the agreement would be somewhat worsened due to the presence of a larger proportion of faint , extended clusters . while the form of the distribution is still well described by @xmath244 ,",
    "the shape and location parameters need to be changed somewhat from those presented in equation  [ eq : bf ] .",
    "in particular , the extended high-@xmath237-tail becomes more important when the fainter gcs are included in the analysis , which is reflected by the larger @xmath278 ( i.e. , 0.16 , as opposed to the value of 0.12 obtained when only the bright gcs are considered ) .",
    "the form of the distribution presented above should serve are a useful constraint for models of gc formation and numerical simulations of their dynamical evolution .",
    "any viable picture of star formation in clusters should produce an observed size distribution that is consistent with the form of @xmath244 , at least for gcs brighter than the luminosity function turnover .",
    "the fact that its form seems to be uniform across the wide range in luminosity and color spanned by acsvcs program galaxies strongly suggests that some quite generic mechanism determines @xmath244 , while the location of the distribution is set by the local properties of the gc system and/or its host galaxy .",
    "we have analysed the half - light radii of gcs in early - type galaxies using the exceptional dataset provided by the acs virgo cluster survey .",
    "we have presented evidence that the average half - light radii @xmath2 of gcs belonging to early - type galaxies increases with galactocentric distance or , alternatively , with decreasing surface brightness .",
    "this dependence is significantly shallower than that observed in our galaxy .",
    "for the first time , we report an increase in @xmath2 with decreasing galaxy color ( @xmath12 decreasing luminosity ) , albeit with modest statistical significance . in agreement with previous observations ,",
    "we find strong evidence that @xmath2 is independent of the luminosity ( mass ) of gcs .",
    "we also find @xmath2 to be @xmath1 smaller for red ( metal - rich ) than for their blue ( metal - poor ) counterparts .",
    "this trend is better explained by a mechanism that is intrinsic to gcs rather than to projection effects . as such",
    ", the observations favor the picture in which this difference follows from the combined effects of mass segregation and the metallicity dependence of stellar lifetimes under the assumption of invariant average half-_mass _ radii ( jordn 2004 ) .",
    "we have discussed the predictions of two simple pictures for the origin of the @xmath0 of gcs : one based in the idea that they are determined by the average ambient pressure surrounding proto - gc clouds , and other that @xmath0 is related to the tidal radius set by the gravitational field of the host galaxy .",
    "both pictures are roughly consistent with the observed behavior , @xmath279 , although some elements of the theoretical framework are lacking in both scenarios .",
    "while our level of understanding of gc formation is still in its infancy , it is clear that the observations of the @xmath0 of gcs can provide important insights into the physical mechanisms which have shaped their formation and evolution .",
    "we have studied the form of the observed distribution of gc half - light radii in early - type galaxies . once corrected for a variety of dependencies on color , radius and surface brightness",
    ", the form of this distribution is remarkably consistent across the range of color and luminosity spanned by our sample of galaxies .",
    "we introduce simple analytic expressions ( equations  [ eq : j ] and [ eq : jt ] ) which satisfactorily describe the form of the @xmath77 distribution in our sample galaxies and in the milky way .",
    "future theories of gc formation and evolution should be able to produce results consistent with this form when predicting the observed distribution of @xmath0 .",
    "once corrected for dependencies on color and surface brightness , the mean half - light radii of gcs can be used as a standard ruler for distance estimation .",
    "specifially , we find a constant value of @xmath280 pc for a gc with color @xmath281 , in a galaxy with color @xmath5 , and at an underlying @xmath6-band surface brightness of @xmath7 mag arcsec@xmath8 . a first attempt at a geometric calibration of this method based on the galactic gc system gives an independent distance to the virgo cluster of 16@xmath2112.3 mpc . while these conclusions rest heavily on two datapoints besides the bulk of galaxies in virgo ( vcc  731 and ngc  4697 ) , the ongoing acs fornax cluster survey ( jordn et  al",
    ", in preparation ) , which is similar to the acsvcs but focusing on 43 early - type members of the fornax cluster , will be invaluable in this regard by adding many additional datapoints at @xmath282 mpc ( tonry et  al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "while not as efficient some other distance indicators , such as sbf , the use of @xmath78 as a distance indicator could , in principle , offer some advantages that could render it a valuable complement to other gc - based method such as the gc luminosity function .",
    "for instance , half - light radii are expected to remain roughly constant during the evolution of a gc .",
    "this is certainly not the case for luminosity , which will be affected by age and metallicity , quantities which are not necessarily known _ a priori_. additionally , it is not necessary to go past the turnover of the luminosity function if enough clusters to accurately determine @xmath283 can be accumulated up to brighter magnitudes .",
    "assuming one could measure @xmath78 up to @xmath284 of the psf fwhm of a diffraction - limited telescope of diameter @xmath285 at a wavelength of @xmath286 , this technique could be applied out to distances of @xmath287 mpc ( @xmath288 m ) , @xmath289 mpc ( @xmath290 m ) and @xmath291 mpc ( @xmath292 m ) , illustrating the prospect for its implementation with future observing facilities . in practice",

    "what is observed at the detector is an integral over each pixel of the psf - convolved object ; note that we include in the term psf the effects of the telescope optics and detectors .",
    "the exact nature of the physical effects that give rise to the observed light distribution are of no concern to us here , as long as we have an empirical way of determining the final distribution on the detector of the light from a celestial point source . with this definition of the psf , @xmath293 , the observed flux @xmath294 at a given pixel in the detector",
    "is given by        if @xmath296 can be described parametrically by a set of parameters @xmath298 , and if a model for @xmath293 is available , then the parameters in @xmath298 can be simply estimated by @xmath299 minimization of the observed two - dimensional light distribution minus a predicted model . because the family of steady - state dynamical models presented by king ( 1966 ) are known to provide an excellent match to the observed light profiles of most galactic gcs , we have chosen to parameterize @xmath296 by these models",
    "king models are a one - parameter family indexed by the central potential , @xmath128 , or equivalently , by the concentration , @xmath300 , where @xmath202 is the tidal radius ( the point at which the density is zero ) and @xmath301 is the core radius ( the point at which the density falls to roughly half of its central value ) .",
    "in addition to @xmath182 , there are two arbitrary scaling factors : the total magnitude , @xmath302 , and one related to spatial scale .",
    "the latter is typically taken to the core radius , but we choose to work with the half - light radius @xmath0 . for king models ,",
    "the ratio @xmath303 is uniquely determined by the concentration , so the choice of either is equivalent .",
    "there is no analytic expression for the spatial density corresponding to the lowered maxwellian phase space distribution assumed by king ( 1966 ) , but the density is easily obtained by an integration of poisson s equation .",

    ", a library of king - model density profiles was constructed , computed in a grid of 300 equally spaced points in @xmath128 ranging from @xmath305 to @xmath306 , which corresponds to the range @xmath307 .",
    "this library is read into memory at the start of kingphot and a model of a given @xmath182 is obtained by spline interpolation between the two closest models in the library .    to represent @xmath293",
    ", we adopt the method implemented in the daophot ii program ( stetson 1987 ; 1993 ) .",

    "the psfs for the current work were determined empirically using moderately crowded fields in the galactic gc 47 tucanae as described in jordn et  al .",
    "( 2004a ) .    given the adopted king model , the corresponding model parameters , and the psf model , the predicted light distribution at the detector can be obtained by calculating the convolution in equation  [ eq : conv ] .",
    "the convolution is performed via a fast fourier transform using routines from the fastest fourier transform in the west library ( fftw ; frigo & johnson 2005 )    let us denote the observed data at a pixel @xmath308 by @xmath309 , and the prediction of a psf - convolved king model centered at position @xmath310 in the detector by @xmath311 .",

    "these radial weights are included to assist convergence as discussed in stetson ( 1987 ) .",
    "initially , the parameters for all gcs were determined using @xmath321 pixels .",
    "our simulations show that for extended clusters , with @xmath322 , the measured @xmath0 starts to suffer from biases ; for larger gcs , we increased the value of @xmath323 and redetermined the best - fit parameters .",
    "this was repeated until the condition @xmath324 is met or @xmath325 pixel .",
    "this condition is satisfied for all gcs considered in this analysis .",
    "minimizations were carried with cern s minuit package .",
    "the minimization was done in two steps .",
    "first , a simplex ( nelder & mead 1965 ) minimization algorithm was used , followed by a variable metric method with inexact line search ( migrad ) . in the simplex minimization the concentration is held fixed at @xmath326 , a typical value for galactic gcs ( harris 1996 ) . the starting values for the parameters @xmath327",
    "are obtained from sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) while @xmath0 is set to @xmath328 , roughly the angle subtended by @xmath329 pc at the virgo distance . after the simplex minimization , the center @xmath310 is fixed while @xmath182 is allowed to vary . before starting the migrad minimization , a grid search is done in @xmath330 and the minimization",
    "is started at the parameters that give the lowest @xmath299 in this grid search .",
    "this procedure is done to avoid biasing the final result by the choice of fixing @xmath182 in the simplex minimization and to avoid converging to a local , rather than a global , minimum .",
    "after migrad is run , the best fit parameters are recorded . to estimate the uncertainties a bootstrap procedure is used . from the oberved data @xmath309 within the fitting radius , a random set of @xmath309",
    "is generated and the minimization is re - run , 50 times , with this new set .",
    "the output parameters recorded , and the @xmath316 of the recovered parameters is taken to represent the uncertainties .    to test the performance of this code ,",
    "it has been run on a set of simulated gcs to which an appropriate amount of instrumental and poisson noise has been added .",
    "for all combinations of @xmath330 in the grid @xmath331 and @xmath332 pc ( at the distance of virgo ) , 15 objects were simulated and the best - ft parameters recorded .",
    "this was done for instrumental magnitudes of @xmath333 ( for a 1s exposure ) , with a fitting radius of @xmath334 wfc pixels .",
    "the relevant results of these simulations are summarized in figure  [ fig : app ] , where we show the average @xmath335 ( for all simulated @xmath182 values ) . here",
    ", @xmath336 is the difference between the recovered and input @xmath0 , two sets of error bars are shown for each point , slightly displaced .",
    "the one to the left shows the observed @xmath316 of @xmath335 while the one to the right indicates the average uncertainty of @xmath335 returned by kingphot .",
    "instrumental magnitudes can be transformed into @xmath6-band ones by @xmath337 .",
    "thus , only the four uppermost panels of figure  [ fig : app ] are relevant to the present work ( due to the construction of the sample ; see equation  [ sel1 ] ) .",
    "we conclude on the basis of these simulations that the performance of kingphot is , for observational material similar to the acsvcs , largely unbiased for @xmath338 pc . at the same time",
    ", it is apparent that , for @xmath339 pc , there are always systematic biases which are of order @xmath340 .",
    "it is also apparent is that a bias arises when the intrinsic @xmath0 approaches @xmath318 , as is revealed by the rightmost point in each panel .",
    "these bias , however , is avoided if @xmath341 , so it is necessary that this condition is satisfied _ post - facto _ by iteratively adjusting @xmath318 as we have done ( see above ) .",
    "finally , the uncertainties returned by kingphot agree very well with the observed dispersion on the @xmath335 values , and thus we conclude that our bootstrap procedure estimates the uncertainties properly .",
    "needless to say , such simulations can provide information only on the intrinsic performance of the code , and neglect sources of error arising from inaccuracies in the assumed forms for @xmath296 or @xmath293 .",
    "uncertainties arising from systematic errors of this sort can be estimated from the independent measurements in the two bandpasses ( see  2 ) .",

    "<S> we have measured half - light radii , @xmath0 , for thousands of globular clusters ( gcs ) belonging to the one hundred early - type galaxies observed in the _ acs virgo cluster survey _ and the elliptical galaxy ngc  4697 . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the dependencies of the measured half - light radii on both the properties of the gcs themselves and their host galaxies reveals that , in analogy with gcs in the galaxy but in a milder fashion , the average half - light radius increases with increasing galactocentric distance or , alternatively , with decreasing galaxy surface brightness . </S>",
    "<S> for the first time , we find that the average half - light radius decreases with the host galaxy color . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that there is no evidence for a variation of @xmath0 with the luminosity of the gcs . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find in agreement with previous observations that the average @xmath0 depends on the color of gcs , with red gcs being @xmath1 smaller than their blue counterparts . we show that this difference is probably a consequence of an intrinsic mechanism , rather than projection effects , and that it is in good agreement with the mechanism proposed in jordn ( 2004 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss these findings in light of two simple pictures for the origin of the @xmath0 of gcs and show that both lead to a behavior in rough agreement with the observations . after accounting for the dependencies on galaxy color , galactocentric radius and underlying surface brightness </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the average gc half - light radii @xmath2 can be successfully used as a standard ruler for distance estimation . </S>",
    "<S> we outline the methodology , provide a calibration for its use , and discuss the prospects for this distance estimator with future observing facilities . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath3 pc for gcs with @xmath4 mag in a galaxy with color @xmath5 mag and at an underlying surface @xmath6-band brightness of @xmath7 mag arcsec@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> using this technique , we place an upper limit of 3.4  mpc on the 1-@xmath9 line - of - sight _ depth _ of the virgo cluster . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we examine the form of the @xmath0 distribution for our sample galaxies and provide an analytic expression which successfully describes this distribution . </S>"
