    "these observations revealed a luminous x - ray source , with a flat x - ray spectrum perhaps indicative of a soft x - ray cut - off due to absorption .",
    "we now present the _ xmm - newton _  observations of pks  0537@xmath1286 .",
    "values of @xmath10  kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 and @xmath11 have been assumed and all fit parameters are given in the quasar rest - frame .",
    "pks  0537@xmath1286 was observed during orbit 51 of the cal - pv phase of _ xmm - newton_. processing was performed using the xmm sas ( science analysis software ) .",
    "the initial data files were processed with the emchain and epchain scripts , using the latest known calibration .",
    "x - ray events corresponding to patterns 0 - 12 for the 2 mos cameras ( similar to grades 0 - 4 in _ asca _ ) were used ; for the pn , only pattern 0 events ( single pixel events ) were selected .",
    "for the mos detectors , electronic noise was screened out by rejecting events with negative e3 values . known hot or bad pixels were also removed during screening .",
    "we refer the reader to turner _",
    "et al . _  ( 2001 ) for an in - depth description of the epic - mos instruments , whilst a detailed account of the epic - pn detector can be found in strder _",
    "et al . _  ( 2001 ) .",
    "the non x - ray background remained relatively low throughout the observations , so it was not necessary to filter events on time .",
    "we also found no variability in the source count rate during the observation .",
    "the screening process yielded 19.2 ksec of data for mos-1 , 28.0 ksec for mos-2 and 38 ksec for the pn detector .",
    "source spectra were extracted from circular regions of 30  radius for the pn ( to avoid the edge of the chip ) and 1  radius for the mos .",
    "background spectra were taken from an identical circular region , offset from the source position .",
    "the majority of source counts fall onto these source regions ( at least 80% for the pn and @xmath1290% for the mos ) , whilst the background count rates are very low ; @xmath13  cts  s@xmath3 , @xmath14  cts  s@xmath3 and @xmath15  cts  s@xmath3 for the pn , mos-1 and mos-2 respectively .",
    "the net source count rates obtained are 0.257@xmath160.004  cts / s , 0.268@xmath160.003  cts / s and 0.513@xmath160.004  cts / s , for mos-1 , mos-2 and the pn respectively . at this level , even in full - frame mode ,",
    "photon pile - up is negligible .",
    "we do not consider the rgs data in this paper , as the count rate is too low ( @xmath17  cts / s ) for a reliable analysis of the dispersed spectrum .",
    "the background subtracted epic spectra were fitted , using xspec v11.0 , with the latest response matrices produced by the epic team ; the systematic level of uncertainty is @xmath18% .",
    "spectra were binned to a minimum of 20 counts per bin , to apply the @xmath19 minimisation technique .",
    "all subsequent errors are quoted at 90% confidence ( @xmath20 for 2 interesting parameters ) .",
    "we initially fitted the individual x - ray spectra from the 3 epic detectors , to check for consistency between the datasets . from a simple power - law fit",
    "it was found that the photon index agreed for all 3 detectors ( @xmath21=1.25 - 1.30 ) and that the relative normalisations were consistent to within 5% .",
    "therefore we proceeded to fit all three datasets simultaneously , assuming a galactic column of @xmath22 ( elvis _ et al . _",
    "the epic spectrum is plotted in figure 1 and the results from a power - law fit to the broad - band data are shown as fit 1 ( in table 1 ) .",
    "clearly a power - law is a good fit ( @xmath23 ) , with no obvious continuum curvature present .",
    "we note that the power - law photon index of @xmath4 is considerably flatter than the mean quasar index ( e.g. reeves & turner 2000 ) , even for radio - loud quasars which have a typical mean of @xmath24 . the observed broad - band ( 0.2 - 10 kev ) flux is 3.1@xmath25  erg  @xmath26  s@xmath3 , which , under the assumption of isotropic x - ray emission , corresponds to a luminosity at @xmath0 of 2.2@xmath27 erg  s@xmath3 ( 0.8 - 40 kev in the qso frame ) .",
    "this makes pks  0537@xmath1286 one of the most luminous known quasars in the universe .",
    "we also searched the spectrum for signs of photoelectric absorption .",
    "there are several reported cases in the literature of excess x - ray absorption towards high z quasars , from _ rosat _  and _ asca_observations ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the excellent soft x - ray response of the epic instruments allows us to place very tight limits on the amount of obscuring material .",
    "however we found no excess absorption towards pks  0537@xmath1286 , the power - law extending un - broken down to 0.2 kev .",
    "a confidence contour plot is shown as figure 2 ; we place a 90% upper limit on the intrinsic column of @xmath28 , which in the quasar rest frame ( at z=3.104 ) corresponds to @xmath29 .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the relative brightness of pks  0537@xmath1286 allows us , for the first time , to search for signs of the iron k@xmath30 emission line in a high redshift quasar .",
    "we restricted our search to the 1 - 2 kev band , where the iron k line should appear at this redshift ; conveniently the throughput of the _ xmm - newton _  epic instrument reaches a maximum in this band .",
    "we initially fixed the line width at @xmath31  ev and the result is shown as fit 2 .",
    "a narrow fe k line is detected ( equivalent width ew=33ev , qso frame ) , at 95% confidence for 2 parameters , whilst the line peaks at 6.15@xmath160.15  kev ( or 1.5 kev observed - frame ) .",
    "a close up of the epic pn and mos data , illustrating the line detection at @xmath0 , is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the confidence contours to the line , from a fit to the mos and pn data , are also shown in figure 4 .",
    "although the line energy is consistent with neutral material , the apparent redshift of the line may indicate an origin from the inner quasar accretion disk ( fabian _ et al . _",
    "1989 ) or from reprocessing in infalling matter .",
    "the velocity width of the line is not well constrained , with an upper limit of @xmath32  ev .",
    "the line emission is considerably weaker than the fe lines observed in seyfert  1 galaxies ( nandra _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) and in some radio - quiet quasars ( reeves & turner 2000 ) .    finally we tried to constrain the iron k absorption edge , which in disk reflection models ( e.g. george & fabian 1991 ) is predicted to accompany the iron k line .",
    "we fixed the edge energy at 7.1 kev , consistent with neutral iron .",
    "we obtained a value of @xmath33 , although the edge is only detected at 90% confidence ( see fit 2 ) .",
    "since the proposed iron k line ( observed at 1.5 kev ) lies near the al - k@xmath30 line , at 1.487 kev , in the detector background , we have checked to see whether this can contribute towards the observed fe line flux at 1.5 kev . to do this",
    "we extracted a large source - free background region , of 4radius , from the pks  0537@xmath1286 pn field , and then measured the strength of the al k@xmath30 line directly .",
    "we re - normalised the background fluxes ( from an area 63 times larger ) , to the size of our source extraction region .",
    "it was found that the total integrated count rate from the al k@xmath30 line was @xmath34  ct  s@xmath3 , compared to the quasar line count rate of @xmath35  ct  s@xmath3 .",
    "thus we can conclude that that the al k@xmath30 line contributes only @xmath64% of the quasar line flux , _ before background subtraction_. note that at 1.5 kev , the total background count rate is @xmath361% of the total quasar count rate .",
    "there are also no strong variations in background , across the central chips , for either the mos or pn .    as a final check",
    ", we also used a long closed - filter pn observation ( in orbit 59 ) to estimate the background count rate from the al k@xmath30 line .",
    "we found that the total flux in the al line ( for an area the size of the pn source extraction region ) was @xmath37  ct  s@xmath3 , consistent with the value given above , corresponding to only 5% of the quasar line counts .",
    "therefore it is highly unlikely that the background subtraction at 1.5  kev contributes towards the detection of the quasar iron k line .",
    "having detected these weak iron k features , we next tried to constrain the properties of the compton reflection ` hump ' , particularly as the _ observed _ emission extends up to 40 kev in the quasar rest frame .",
    "we used the pexrav model in xspec ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) , assuming a disk inclination of 30 and a high energy cut - off equal to 100  kev .",
    "we left r , the fraction of material ( of @xmath38  steradian solid angle ) that is irradiated by the x - ray source ( where r=@xmath39 ) , as a free parameter in the fits .",
    "the results are given as fit 3 .",
    "we find a best - fit value for the reflection continuum of r@xmath40 , indicating that the reflecting material subtends a solid - angle lower than the 2@xmath41 steradians expected from an accretion disk geometry .",
    "the small amount of reflection ( with r@xmath60.25 ) , is consistent with the low equivalent width of the iron k line .",
    "we note however , that our assumption for the high energy cut - off of the hard x - ray power - law may effect the fits . to test this we tried two additional fits , one with a cut - off at 250  kev and one fit with no high energy cut - off ( fits 4 - 5 ) . for the former",
    "we find that the reflection component is even weaker ( r@xmath42 ) , whilst with no cut - off the value of r is consistent with zero ( r  @xmath43 ) .",
    "comparing the statistics of fits 3 - 5 , there is a preference for very weak reflection and no high energy cut - off , although the differences are not significant .",
    "finally we tried fixing r at 1 in our fits . in this case , whatever cut - off energy was assumed , the fit obtained was always considerably worse ( by @xmath44 , or at @xmath45% confidence ) .      in figure 5 , we compile all the published multi - wavelength data on pks  0537@xmath1286 , together with the _ xmm - newton _  spectrum . the sed ( spectral energy distribution ) of pks",
    "0537@xmath1286 is extreme when compared to a typical radio - loud quasar ( elvis _ et al . _  1994 ) . in pks",
    "0537@xmath1286 the majority of the observed quasar power is radiated in the x - ray band ( typically in agn the x - ray emission is only 5% of the bolometric luminosity ; e.g. elvis _ et al . _",
    "the optical - uv emission is also relatively weak in comparison to the x - rays ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "however this is consistent with the observations of other high redshift blazar - like agn ( see fabian _ et al . _  1999",
    ") , where a strong , but flat , x - ray emission component is also seen .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  observations have showed that pks  0537@xmath1286 is an extremely luminous quasar , with a particularly flat x - ray spectrum and weak iron k emission and reflection features .",
    "indeed the total power output of pks  0537@xmath1286 is dominated by the x - ray emission .",
    "a likely interpretation is that the x - rays mainly arise through the inverse compton emission associated with a relativistic jet . in this scenario",
    "relativistic electrons ( or positrons ) in the jet compton upscatter either the low energy synchrotron photons produced in the jet ( synchrotron self compton - jones , odell & stein 1974 , ghisellini , maraschi & treves 1985 ) or alternatively the thermal optical / uv photons from the accretion disk ( external inverse compton - ghisellini & madau 1996 ) .",
    "this can naturally account for the hard spectrum of pks  0537@xmath1286 , as in the x - ray band we are observing the onset of this inverse compton component , presumably extending out to @xmath47-ray energies .",
    "as it appears that we can rule out a scenario whereby all of the primary x - ray emission originates above the accretion disk , we instead tried to fit the data with two continuum emission components ; a ` seyfert - like ' steep power - law ( with @xmath21 fixed at 1.9 ) originating from near the accretion disk , and a hard , bright jet component with a flat x - ray slope ( i.e. @xmath48 as before ) .",
    "we modified the seyfert - like power - law with a continuum reflection component ( assuming r=1 ) and also added a narrow iron k line of equivalent width 150  ev . although poorly constrained , we obtained a good fit to the data when the seyfert - like component was typically 4 - 5 times weaker than the flat jet component . thus in pks",
    "0537@xmath1286 we may be observing two x - ray components ; the steep seyfert - like emission from near the disk , responsible for the iron k line , and the hard component from the jet , which considerably dilutes the disk reflection and line features .",
    "this provides a possible explanation for the apparent weakness of the iron k line and compton reflection hump , when compared to other observations of seyfert galaxies and quasars .",
    "if the relativistic jet is orientated close to the line - of - sight , as expected in unification schemes for quasars ( antonucci 1993 ) , then any disk reflection features can be diluted due to doppler boosting of the featureless x - ray continuum , through the bulk motion of the jet .",
    "this is consistent with other observations of x - ray luminous , predominantly radio - loud quasars , where the strength of the iron line is diminished ( the so - called ` x - ray baldwin effect ' - iwasawa & taniguchi 1993 ) . for pks  0537@xmath1286 , at a redshift of @xmath0 , any iron k emission features are redshifted into a more favourable part of the epic bandpass , where the effective area is near its maximum . _ this has enabled us to detect a weak iron k line in pks  0537@xmath1286 ; indeed at @xmath0 this is the most distant iron k emission line detected to date .",
    "_ the limited statistics do not allow the line width or shape to be constrained .",
    "however , the median energy of 6.15  kev implies reprocessing in ` cold ' matter close to the central black hole or from infalling material at @xmath49  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "clearly , more detailed studies with _ xmm - newton _  of other high redshift quasars , both radio - loud and radio - quiet , are required to explore this .",
    "past studies with _ rosat _  and _ asca _  have showed that several high redshift radio - loud quasars appear to show intrinsic x - ray absorption , above that from our own galaxy ( see bechtold _",

    "correlations involving samples of quasars ( reeves _ et al . _",
    "1997 , reeves & turner 2000 ) have showed that this apparent excess absorption is correlated with object redshift , with many high z quasars requiring substantial absorption columns ( up to @xmath50  @xmath26 ) , whilst low z quasars remain unabsorbed .",
    "recently even , evidence has been presented for substantial soft x - ray absorption towards one blazar - like object ( gb  1428 + 4217 ) at @xmath51 ( boller _ et al . _  2000 ) . at present",
    "the nature of this absorption is unclear , but it could be related to the dense galactic - scale environments proposed in the early evolutionary stages of quasars ( see fabian 1999 ) . alternatively in some objects",
    "the x - ray absorption may originate from intervening damped lyman-@xmath30 systems , which are thought to be associated with the disks of young protogalaxies ( e.g. wolfe _ et al . _",
    "1994 ) .    from the published optical ( rest frame uv ) spectrum",
    ", it is known that pks  0537@xmath1286 has substantial uv absorption , with at least two different lyman - limit systems observed close to the known redshift of the quasar ( wright _ et al . _",
    "1978 , osmer _ et al . _",
    "the velocities of these systems are @xmath52 and 40000  km  s@xmath3 , _ blueshifted _ with respect to the quasar .",
    "the latter system has a very deep lyman - continuum cut - off at 912a ( rest frame ) , where the quasar continuum flux drops close to zero .",
    "so it perhaps seems surprising at first that in this _ xmm - newton _  observation we detect no intrinsic x - ray absorption towards pks  0537@xmath1286 .",
    "however in order to measure appreciable line - of - sight x - ray absorption ( of the order @xmath53",
    "@xmath26 ) , one would have to encounter a damped lyman-@xmath30 system .",
    "we can now rule this scenario out in pks  0537@xmath1286 , and note the chance coincidence of such a system out to @xmath54 is @xmath620 - 30% ( e.g. steidel 1992 ) .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  observation is in contrast to some earlier _ asca _  and _ rosat",
    "_  observations of pks  0537@xmath1286 , where a low energy x - ray cut - off had been claimed ( reeves & turner 1997 , cappi _ et al . _",
    "one possibility is that the absorption is variable ; we note the ` warm ' absorbers observed in low z agn are known to vary ( e.g. mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , otani _",
    "et al . _  1996",
    "; ngc 3227 , george _ et al . _",
    "it is also possible that if the absorption is associated with a high velocity system , the absorbing material may move out of the line - of - sight . finally , the photon statistics on the earlier _ asca_and _ rosat _",
    "observations were quite poor , so it is possible that the earlier detection was spurious . we conclude that it will be particularly important to utilise future _ xmm - newton _   observations to estimate the frequency of these ` absorbed quasars ' , as a probe of some of the most distant matter in the universe , and to determine the environments of some of the earliest quasars .",
