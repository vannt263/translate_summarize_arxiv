    "the general assembly of the united nations formally established the united nations university - unu - in 1972 and approved the university charter and resolution in december 1973 .",
    "unu s academic work was launched in september 1975 ( unu , 2016a ) .",
    "+ on unu s website it is stated : _",
    "`` the mission of the un university is to contribute , through collaborative research and education , to efforts to resolve the pressing global problems of human survival , development and welfare that are the concern of the united nations , its peoples and member states . '' _ ( unu , 2016b ) .",
    "+ in addition , article i , paragraph 2 of the university charter states : _ `` the university shall devote its work to research into the pressing global problems of human survival , development and welfare that are the concern of the united nations and its agencies , with due attention to the social sciences and the humanities as well as natural sciences , pure and applied . '' _ ( unu , 2016c ) .",
    "+ in practice , unu faces three main tasks : ( i ) to perform interdisciplinary research to cope with imperative global problems ; ( ii ) acting as a `` think tank '' transferring research results into concrete operation instructions ( recommendations ) for the united nations ( un ) and its member states ; and ( iii ) to establish and execute postgraduate trainings .",
    "all three tasks are , of course , dependent of and intertwined with the necessity of providing and developing appropriate capacities and facilities ( unu , 2016d ) .",
    "+ it is certainly of interest to analyse unu s scientific acitivities from a bibliometric point of view , i.e. ( i ) to investigate unu s overall productivity and citation performance , ( ii ) to determine unu s degree of interdisciplinarity and ( international ) cooperation , and ( iii ) to have a look at the thematic subjects unu is dealing with .",
    "+ the bibliometric investigation presented here uses publication and citation data from the web of science database ( wos ) .",
    "it is therefore restricted to papers published in scientific journals indexed in the wos .",
    "papers were retrieved and downloaded with all bibliographic data from the web of science ( wos ) on october 11 , 2016 , using an appropriate unu - specific address search profile .",
    "+ for the analysis of unu s paper output and its distribution to different document types all retrieved records were included .",
    "unus research was analysed from research - relevant papers only , i.e. papers indexed as article , proceedings paper , or review .",
    "the citation performance of unu s papers was measured applying the percentile rank index ( pri ) developed by pudovkin and garfield ( pudovkin and garfield , 2009 ) .",
    "this version of a percentile rank index was called pg - pri ( stegmann , 2014 ) . because no other pri methods are involved here , `` pg - pri '' and `` pri '' are used synonymously . + for the pg - pri calculation of an individual paper its citation rank among its `` paper peers ''",
    "must be determined .",
    "therefore , the citation data of all papers of the same document type published in the same journal in the same year are required , i.e. the respected journal - year pairs had to be retrieved and downloaded from the wos which was done between the 13^th^ and 16^th^ october 2016 .",
    "pg - pris of unu papers were calculated only for papers of the document type article published prior to 2014 .",
    "+ the calculation of pg - pri and determination of the global ( expected ) average pri have been described ( pudovkin and garfield , 2009 , pudovkin et al . , 2012 ,",
    "stegmann , 2014 ) . briefly , after determination of the position ( citation rank ) of a paper in the corresponding paper set ( the year volume of the respective journal ) , its pg - pri value was calculated according to the formula @xmath0 where n is the number of papers in the year set of the journal and r is the citation rank of the paper .",
    "r=1 is the top rank ( most cited paper ) with pri=100 . for determination of the global ( expected ) average pri",
    "the unu articles were ordered according to the number of papers published in the corresponding journal - year set .",
    "the average pri was calculated according to the formula @xmath1 where n is the number of papers published in the journal - year pair at the median position of the ordered set .",
    "+      to measure the diversity of unu s research shannon s entropy formula ( also known as _ shannon diversity index _ ) ( shannon , 1949 , p. 681 ) was applied to journals , scientific ( sub)fields ( wos categories ) , and keywords of unu s research papers .",
    "the entropy ( diversity ) _ h _ is calculated according to the formula @xmath2 with @xmath3 where s is the number of species ( species richness ) ( e.g. , journals ) , n~i~ the number of individuals in species i ( the abundance of species i , i.e. the number of papers in journal i ) , n the total number of all individuals ( papers ) , and p~i~ the relative abundance of species ( journal ) i , calculated as the proportion of individuals ( papers ) of species ( journal ) i to the total number of individuals ( papers ) .",
    "ln is the natural logarithm .",
    "the maximal diversity is equal to the logarithm of s : @xmath4      to identify the topics of unu s research the wos subject categories ( record field sc ) to which the publishing journals are assigned and the keywords ( record field de : author keywords , record field i d : keyword plus^^ , assigned during the indexing process ) were extracted and analysed . for cluster analysis of keywords the co - word analysis technique described by callon et al .",
    "( 1991 ) was applied .",
    "a detailed description of the algorithm can be found in stegmann and grohmann ( 2003 ) .",
    "the same thresholds were applied as in stegmann ( 2014 ) , i.e. a minimal frequency of 4 ( ( occurrence of a keyword in at least 4 records ) , a minimal cosine similarity of 0.2 , and a minimal ( maximal ) cluster size of 3 ( 10 ) distinct keywords . to label a cluster ( besides its number )",
    "the keywords contained in it were ranked according to the product of link strengths ( cosine values ) and frequency ; the keyword with the highest product was selected as cluster name ( stegmann , 2014 ) .",
    "extraction of record field contents , clustering , data analysis , calculations and visualisation were done using homemade programs and scripts for perl ( version 5.14.2 ) and the software package r version 3.2.3 ( r core team , 2015 ) .",
    "all operations were performed on a commercial pc run under ubuntu version 12.04 lts .",
    "figure 1 shows un s paper output .",
    "a total of 1314 papers were retrieved and downloaded from the wos .",
    "although unu s academic work began in 1975 ( see introduction ) , a continous paper output seems to start only after 1995 .",
    "one reason may be that it certainly takes some time until freshly founded academic institutions are able to do real research apart from administrative and management tasks such as recruitment of staff and purchase of necessary equipment .",
    "another reason might be that initially unu s researcher perhaps did not use in their paper publications an unu - specific institutional address with the consequence that those papers can not be found by an unu - specific address search in the wos .",
    "on unu s website publications are listed from 1994 onward ( ( unu , 2016e ) .",
    "a quick survey of the years 1994 and 1995 reveals that many of the papers are `` research memoranda '' and have not been published in regular scientific journal . in the more recent years , however , unu s paper output is strongly increasing , culminating for now in nearly 200 papers published in 2015 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "* total no . of papers : 1314 ( 77.4% articles , 7.3% editorials , 5.19% proceedings papers , 4.3% reviews , 2.7% book reviews , 3.1% other ) . [ fig : fig01 ]    more than three - fourths of unu s paper output are of document type article ( figure 1 ) , indicating a strong research orientation of unu s institutes .      for the analysis of the international standing of unu s research articles the percentile rank indexing method of pudovkin and garfield ( 2009 ) was applied ( pg - pri , see methods ) .",
    "652 articles published before 2013 were found .",
    "they are distributed to 569 journal - year article sets .",
    "these sets were retrieved , and the articles of each set were ranked according to the number of cites they had received at the time of retrieval ( see methods ) .",
    "thus , the citation rank of each of the 652 unu articles was determined .",
    "figure 2 displays the pg - pri value of each of the 652 research articles of unu .",
    "the median of unu s papers as well as the expected global average are also marked .",
    "the median of unu s papers ordered according to the number of papers published in the correponding journal year sets ( see methods ) is between 326 and 327 , i.e. 326.5 .",
    "the number of papers in the journal - year sets at position 326 and 327 of the ordered sets are 70 and 71 , thus the number of papers at the median position is 70.5 .",

    "+ all of the topics listed in tables 6 - 9 obviously mark and identify ( global ) problem areas which are not only worthwhile to be worked on but also demand , on one hand , immediate ( political ) actions in order to prevent irreversible damages of existing social and ecologic systems , and on the other hand , require amply research efforts for sustainable problem solutions .",
    "+ from the research diversity results ( see above ) and the journal , subfield and keyword data shown in table 3 - 9 and figure 4 one certainly may draw the conclusion that unu is engaged in research on sustainability , environment , economics , public administration , and many other topics .",
