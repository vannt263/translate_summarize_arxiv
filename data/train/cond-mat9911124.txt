    "the reaction - diffusion process @xmath5 has been discussed for a long time .",
    "this conceptually simple process displays a rich variety of phenomena ( nonclassical reaction kinetics , clustering and segregation , front formation ) and , depending on the interpretation of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( particles , quasi - particles , topological defects , chemical reagents , etc . )",
    ", it provides a model for a number of phenomena in physics , chemistry , and biology .    in many cases of interest ,",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are ions ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and these ions are initially separated from each other .",
    "an example we shall discuss below is the formation of liesegang bands where an electrolyte @xmath8 diffuses into a gel column containing another electrolyte @xmath9 .",
    "the concentration of @xmath6-s is taken to be much larger than those of the @xmath7-s , thus the reaction front @xmath4 moves along the column .",
    "an appropriate choice of reagents then leads to quasiperiodic precipitation ( @xmath10 ) in the wake of the front ( fig.1 ) .",
    "= 0.155    [ fig1 ]    in general , the background ions ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) are expected to play a role in a process described above . nevertheless , the usual approach is to neglect them and consider only a contact interaction between neutral reagents @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this approximation is based on the argument that the background ions provide only screening and , furthermore , the screening length is much smaller than the scale of concentration variations relevant in the formation of a macroscopic pattern .",
    "although the argument sounds compelling , one should note that the background ions may generate macroscopic effects even if the screening length is negligible .",
    "indeed , if the mobility of one of the background ions ( @xmath2 in the liesegang case ) is much smaller than the other mobilities then the motion and the properties of the reaction front are altered .",
    "since the properties of the reaction front are crucial in determining the pattern one expects that the presence of background ions gives rise to macroscopic changes in the observed patterns .",
    "our aim with this work is to verify the above expectation and to investigate how the diffusion and front formation are affected by unequal mobilities of background ions .",
    "more precisely , we shall study the time evolution of ion - concentrations in the process a^^-+a^^++b^^++b^^- c+a^^++b^^- [ process ] where the reaction product @xmath11 is assumed to vanish from the system .",
    "the process starts at @xmath12 form an initial condition where the electrolytes @xmath8 and @xmath13 are separated and their concentrations ( @xmath14 ) are constant in the left ( @xmath15 ) and right ( @xmath16 ) half - spaces , respectively a^-(x , t=0)=&a^+(x , t=0)=a_0&(-x ) + b^+(x , t=0)=&b^-(x , t=0)=b_0&(x ) [ initcond ] where @xmath17 is the step function .",
    "such an initial state with @xmath18 is actually used in liesegang experiments , and this choice is also motivated by the fact that investigations of front formation from such initial state have proved to be instrumental in understanding the @xmath5 process @xcite .    the study of motion of ions is not an easy task and we must simplify the problem to make it tractable .",
    "we believe , however , that our approximations listed below are appropriate at least for the description of the liesegang experiments .    1 .",
    "it is assumed that the phenomena can be described by reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "this appears to be a correct assumption for reactions taking place in a gel where convection is absent .",
    "2 .   the screening length is assumed to be negligible and screening is taken into account by enforcing local electroneutrality . at characteristic ion - concentrations ( @xmath19 ) present in liesegang experiments , the screening length is indeed small ( @xmath20 ) compared both to the characteristic diffusion length ( @xmath21 ) and to the width of the reaction zone ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "further discussion can be found in sec.[electroneutral ] .",
    "3 .   the concentration profiles are assumed to depend only on one spatial coordinate ( @xmath23 in fig.1 ) .",
    "although a one dimensional geometry can be set up in experiments on liesegang phenomena ( the length of the gel column can be made much larger than its width ) , one should note that the finite extent of the sample in the transverse direction poses nontrivial problems with edge effects .",
    "it appears , however , that these effects can be neglected since the final pattern is usually one dimensional to a good accuracy .",
    "the mobility of the reagents and of the background ions are , in general , different . for simplicity",
    ", we shall consider the case with one of the background ions having a significantly distinct diffusion coefficient d_a = d_b = d_bd = d_a .",
    "[ diffconstant ] this is just a technical assumption to keep the number of parameters small and , this also appears to be the most interesting case for liesegang phenomena where @xmath18 .",
    "once the above approximations are made one arrives at a problem that can be studied numerically and , in some limits , analytically .",
    "the process is now simple enough so that the numerical analysis is not hindered by computer time and memory problems , or by difficulties arising from discretization .    in order to arrive at the results",
    ", we shall proceed as follows .",
    "first we discuss how to take into account the electroneutrality constraint in the reaction - diffusion equations ( sec.[electroneutral ] ) .",
    "then the case without reaction is studied and we show that interesting concentration profiles emerge even in the pure diffusion process ( sec.[noreaction ] ) .",
    "the effects of reactions are considered in ( sec.[reactionfront ] ) where the properties of the reaction front are calculated .",
    "finally , the implications for understanding the liesegang phenomena is discussed in sec.[lieseimpli ] .",
    "in a medium such as a gel , the ions move by diffusion and , in the presence of an electric field @xmath24 , the flux of ions @xmath25 is given by the nernst - planck relation @xcite @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the concentration of @xmath28-th ions of integer charge @xmath29 , @xmath30 is their diffusion coefficient , and @xmath31 is a constant combined of the temperature @xmath32 , the gas constant @xmath33 , and the faraday number , @xmath34 .",
    "the potential @xmath35 is determined from the poisson equation = - _ i z_i n_i [ poisson ] where @xmath36 is the permittivity of free space while @xmath37 is the dielectric constant of the system .",
    "an important quantity in ionic diffusion is the debye length @xmath38 that gives the characteristic length - scale associated with charge inbalances r_d= , [ r_d ] where @xmath39 is the characteristic scale of ionic concentrations . in a liesegang experiment ,",
    "one usually has @xmath40 and the process takes place in an aqueous medium ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "thus @xmath42 and one can see that @xmath38 is much smaller than the scale of the macroscopic pattern ( e.g. the width of the bands , @xmath43 ) . as a consequence , one can use the electroneutrality approximation that consists of replacing eq.([poisson ] ) by the constraint _",
    "i z_i n_i = 0 .",
    "[ enconstraint ] denoting now the rate of reaction of the @xmath28-th ion with the others by @xmath44 and assuming that the reaction does not violate electroneutrality ( @xmath45 ) , eq.([nernstplanck ] ) together with the constraint ( [ enconstraint ] ) yields the following equations for the time - evolution of the concentration fields _",
    "t n_i= d_i - r_i(\\{n } ) [ eqiondiff ] where the appropriately scaled electric field that arises from the electroneutrality constraint is given by = .",
    "[ elfield ] it should be noted that there is an extra term in @xmath46 if a steady global current flows through the system .",
    "such a current is not present in the liesegang problem and , trying to keep the discussion as simple as possible , we shall assume that the global current is zero .",
    "for the process of actual interest ( [ process ] ) , reaction takes place only between the ions @xmath0 and @xmath1 and their rate of reaction is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the rate constant .",
    "thus the above equations in a one dimensional geometry take the form _",
    "t a^-&= & d - ka^-b^+ [ 1deq1 ] + _ t b^+&= & d - ka^-b^+ [ 1qeq2 ] + _ t a^+&= & d [ 1qeq3 ] + _ t b^-&= & d [ 1deq4 ] with = .",
    "[ 1de ] equations ( [ 1deq1]-[1de ] ) together with the initial conditions ( [ initcond ] ) provide the mathematical formulation of our problem .    before turning to the solution of the above equations",
    "let us mention that the diffusion - reaction problem of ions in one - dimensional geometry can be tackled numerically without assuming the electroneutrality condition .",
    "the only difficulty is that the discretization of space must be on a finer scale than the debye length and so , in the range of physical parameters where @xmath38 is exceedingly small , the calculation becomes impractical .",
    "one expects ( and we verified it for some cases ) that the solution of the full problem approaches the solution of the corresponding `` electroneutral '' problem as @xmath38 is decreased .",
    "let us begin the analysis of eqs.([1deq1]-[1de ] ) by considering the case of no reactions ( @xmath49 ) and let us further restrict our study to the case of @xmath18 corresponding to the liesegang initial conditions .",
    "the limit of @xmath50 is especially simple and treated in textbooks . in this case",
    ", the two ions @xmath0 and @xmath2 must move together thus an electric field is generated that slows down the more mobile ions and accelerates the slower ions .",
    "the result is an effective diffusion with a diffusion coefficient @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the presence of a small amount of @xmath7-s ( @xmath18 ) does not significantly change the motion of @xmath6-s .",
    "the ions @xmath0 and @xmath2 can separate now but only by an small amount that is compensated by the motion of @xmath7-s . on fig.[fig : noreaction1 ] , we can see the results for the case of @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( slow background ions @xmath54 ) .",
    "= 0.3    = 0.295    = 0.32    the electric field is mainly generated by the motion of the majority @xmath6 ions and , in turn , this field is the determining factor in the motion of the minority @xmath7 ions .",
    "since this field , shown in fig.[fig : noreaction1]b , moves the @xmath54 ( @xmath0 ) ions in the @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) direction , similar effect is felt by the @xmath7 ions .",
    "indeed , as one can see in fig.[fig : noreaction1]c , the @xmath1-s are repelled from the region the @xmath6 ions moved into , while the ions @xmath57 are pulled through this region . as a result",
    "a region emerges where the ionic and diffusive drift of the @xmath7-s are in opposite directions .",
    "it should be noted that the profiles shown in fig.2 keep their shape in time .",
    "the pictures at @xmath58 are obtained from those at @xmath59 by rescaling the @xmath23-axis by a factor @xmath60 .",
    "this numerical observation is the consequence of the fact that the debye length is zero and the initial conditions ( [ initcond ] ) do not contain any length - scales . as a consequence ,",
    "all the length - scales are diffusive lengths proportional to @xmath61 .",
    "the above argument can be seen to work explictely in the limit @xmath62 where an analytic calculation @xcite gives the concentration profiles that can be expressed through error functions of argument @xmath63 .",
    "the complexity of concentration profiles shown in fig.2a and 2c suggest that if reactions are switched on between the ions @xmath0 and @xmath1 then the emerging reaction front may be rather different from the case of neutral reagents .",
    "this is what we shall study in sec.[reactionfront ] .",
    "the full reaction - diffusion process is described by eqs.([1deq1]-[1de ] ) and the solution of these equations with initial condition ( [ initcond ] ) provides the description of the reaction front .",
    "indeed , once the concentration profiles are known , the location and the time evolution of the production of @xmath4 particles is given by r(x , t)=ka^-(x , t)b^+(x , t )",
    ". [ reactionrate ] the properties of @xmath64 are well known for the case of neutral reagents ( @xmath65 ) @xcite . in that case , the reaction takes place in a narrow , moving region whose width is much smaller than the diffusive scales .",
    "the motion of the reaction zone is ` diffusive ' characterized by a diffusion constant @xmath66 x_f = .",
    "[ x_f ] another important feature of the front is that it leaves behind a density of @xmath67-s @xcite c_0=_0^r(x , t)dt , [ c_0 ] that is independent of @xmath23 .",
    "the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath68 can easily be determined for the neutral case by exploiting the smallness of the width of the reaction zone .",
    "the reaction zone is replaced by a point where the diffusion equations are supplemented by boundary conditions and as a result the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath68 are given as functions of @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the presence of a localized , diffusive front is an essential ingredient in the theories of liesegang phenomena , and the parameters of the front ( especially @xmath66 and @xmath68 ) are known to influence the properties of the patterns .",
    "thus the next step is now to find out how the above picture is modified as a result of the ionic character of the reagents .",
    "eqs.([1deq1]-[1de ] ) with initial condition ( [ initcond ] ) can be studied by straightforward numerical methods and one finds that the localized - diffusive - front picture does hold and , furthermore , the scaling properties ( [ x_f]-[c_0 ] ) also remain valid when the ionic interactions are switched on .",
    "the actual values of the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath68 , however , are affected by the presence of background ions .    in order to understand how these results arise ,",
    "let us begin with the numerical observation that the reaction front remains narrow even if the ionic interactions are switched on .",
    "indeed , for characteristic values of @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xcite , we find that the width is in the mesoscopic range ( @xmath22 ) at all times available in a liesegang experiment .",
    "thus , on diffusive length - scales , the reaction zone can be treated as a point ( as in the neutral case ) and one arrives at equations with no reaction terms _",
    "t n_i= d_i .",
    "[ n_i ] the reactions are taken into account by the following boundary conditions at the front a^-(x_f)=b^+(x_f)=0 , +    conditions is that the concentrations of the reagents are zero at the front and the flux of ions @xmath0 and @xmath1 to the reaction zone are equal .",
    "let us now suppose that @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the solutions of the above equations ( [ n_i]-[boundcond ] ) with the initial condition ( [ initcond ] ) .",
    "then one can easily verify that the front - position @xmath78 and the concentrations @xmath79 also solve the same problem for an arbitrary @xmath80 ( note that the initial conditions do not contain any length - scale ) .",
    "thus the functions @xmath77 and @xmath76 must satisfy the conditions @xmath81 and @xmath82 . as a consequence , we find that the concetration profiles obey the following scaling form n_i(x , t)=_i ( ) [ phi ] and the front moves diffusively even if the ionic interactions are taken into account x_f ~. [ xf-2 ] the above relationship ( [ xf-2 ] ) defines the diffusion constant @xmath66 through @xmath83 .",
    "the scaling of the concentrations ( [ phi ] ) together with equation ( [ 1de ] ) imply scaling for the electric field ( x , t)= ( ) .",
    "[ psi ]    these scaling results allow us to investigate the production of the @xmath67 particles .",
    "the number of the @xmath67-s arising in the reaction zone in a unit time is given by the flux of one of the reagents ( e.g. @xmath84 ) entering the front . according to eqs.([phi]-[psi ] )",
    "@xmath84 at @xmath85 is proportional to @xmath86 and the velocity of the front decays in time in the same way , @xmath87 .",
    "it follows then that the density of the @xmath67-s emerging in the wake of the front is a constant c===c_0 [ c0 - 2 ]    the results ( [ phi]-[c0 - 2 ] ) given by the above analytical argument have been confirmed by computer simulations .",
    "an example of such numerical calculation can be seen in fig.[fig : reaction ] .",
    "= 0.33    having established the same scaling properties of the front ( [ xf-2],[c0 - 2 ] ) as in the case of neutral reagents , we turn now to the actual values of the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath68 .",
    "since the motion of the reagents is modified by the electric field ( [ psi ] ) , one expects that @xmath66 and @xmath68 will depend not only on the properties of the reagents but on the properties of the background ions , as well .",
    "we studied the effect of the background ions by changing the diffusion coefficient @xmath88 ( [ diffconstant ] ) and keeping all the other parameters ( @xmath89 ) fixed .",
    "the numerical results for @xmath66 and @xmath68 as functions of @xmath88 , are shown in fig.[fig : front ] .",
    "as one can see , @xmath68 is does not change significantly in the physically relevant range of @xmath90 ( fig.[fig : front]b ) .",
    "the reason for this insensitivity of @xmath68 is that the density of the reaction product for @xmath18 and @xmath91 is mainly determined by the concentration @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "= 0.33    = 0.33    the parameter @xmath66 is much more sensitive to the mobility of the counter ions as shown in fig.[fig : front]a .",
    "although the motion of the front is determined by the interplay of all four types of ions and the process is rather complex , the result in fig.[fig : front]a can be easily understood . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the main effect comes from the counter ions @xmath92 slowing down or speeding up of the motion of the @xmath0-s .",
    "if the diffusion coefficient @xmath88 is smaller than @xmath93 , the @xmath0 ions are pulled back by the @xmath92-s ( otherwise the slow @xmath92 ions would form positive charge density in the left region ) thus fewer @xmath0 particles enter the front which yields a smaller value of @xmath66 .",
    "similar argument leads to the opposite effect for the case of @xmath94 .",
    "the case ( @xmath95 ) is special in the sense that the electric field ( [ 1de ] ) vanishes and the result corresponds to the case of neutral reagents .    in the next section we turn to the theory of liesegang phenomena in order to demostrate the relevance of the above results in the description of a relatively simple pattern - forming process .",
    "liesegang patterns described in sec.[introduction ] have been much investigated for about a century  .",
    "the gross features of _ normal _ patterns in reproducible experiments are rather simple , namely the distance between consecutive bands @xmath96 increases with band order @xmath97 and the positions of the bands obey a _ spacing law _  : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is called the spacing coefficient and @xmath100 .",
    "currently , the liesegang phenomenon is mainly studied as a nontrivial example of pattern formation in the wake of a moving front and the theories of normal patterns revolve around the calculation of @xmath101 .",
    "the main feature of these theories is that the precipitate appears as the system goes through some nucleation- , spinodal- @xcite , or coagulation @xcite , thresholds .",
    "most of these theories are rather complicated , however , and have been developed only recently to the level that @xmath101 can be investigated in detail and , in particular , its dependence on the initial concentrations @xmath69 and @xmath70 can be determined , and connection can be made to the experimentally established matalon - packter law .",
    "none of the above theories address the question of how the liesegang patterns are affected by the presence of background ions although the existence of such an effect is expected .",
    "indeed , let us take , for example , the expression for @xmath101 obtained in a simple version of the _ nucleation and growth _ theory [ see eq.(25 ) in @xcite ] p , [ peq ] where @xmath102 is the diffusion coefficient of the @xmath67 particles while @xmath103 is the threshold concentration of @xmath67-s . the meaning of @xmath66 ( diffusion coefficient of the @xmath67-s ) and @xmath68 ( the concentration of @xmath67-s left behind the front ) is the same as defined in this paper . as one can see from ( [ peq ] ) , the spacing coefficient depends both on @xmath66 and @xmath68 .",
    "thus , on the basis of our results ( see fig.[fig : front ] ) , we expect @xmath101 to be affected by the background ions .    in order to put our expectation on a firmer basis , we calculated @xmath101 numerically employing a recent theory @xcite where the addition of the background ions is straightforward .",
    "the main ingredients in this theory are i ) a moving reaction front that leaves behind the particles @xmath67 , and ii ) a cahn - hilliard type phase - separation dynamics for the @xmath67 particles .",
    "this theory yields the spacing law , and the results for @xmath101 are in agreement with the matalon - packter law .",
    "thus it appears to be a good candidate for the description of the liesegang process .",
    "since the reaction front enters the description only as a source in the cahn - hilliard equation [ see eq.(3 ) in @xcite ] , one can study the effect of background ions by modifying the source according to what has been described in sec.[reactionfront ] .",
    "the results of our numerical work for a particular case with @xmath52 ( the parameters in the cahn - hilliard equation were set to unity ) is displayed in fig.[space - coeff.fig ]    = 0.33    [ space-coeff.fig ]    as can be seen from fig.[space - coeff.fig ] , @xmath101 does depend on @xmath88 and , actually , @xmath101 can change by a factor five compared to the neutral case ( @xmath104 ) provided @xmath88 decreases by a factor ten .",
    "one can also observe that the ionic effect is larger when the counterion @xmath105 is slower than @xmath0 .",
    "these obsevations and the overall picture is in agreement with the result ( [ peq ] ) obtained in the _ nucleation and growth _ theory .",
    "indeed , @xmath68 is weakly dependent on @xmath88 thus the main effect comes from @xmath66 . as fig.[fig : front ] shows , @xmath66 is a smooth , monotonically increasing function of @xmath88 and this translates through eq.([peq ] ) into a monotonically decreasing @xmath106 .",
    "we have thus shown that the backgroung ions can not be neglected in the description of the liesegang phenomena unless the diffusivities of the ions are roughly equal .",
    "although this conclusion appears to complicate the description significantly , the reassuring aspect of the result is that all the complications can be absorbed into the parameters ( @xmath66 and @xmath68 ) of the front . as a consequence ,",
    "previous ideas about the pattern formation remain intact apart from the need of taking account of the renormalization of the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath68 .",
    "a general conclusion we can draw from the present work is that the dynamics of reaction fronts is strongly altered if the diffusivities of the reacting ions differ significantly from those of the background ions .",
    "this conclusion is based on the nontrivial density profiles found in a study of the the simplest reaction scheme @xmath5 and assuming negligible screening length ( electroneutrality approximation ) .",
    "we believe , however , that some aspects of our results ( the reaction front can still be characterized by effective diffusion constant and it still leaves behind a constant density of reaction product ) are robust since they appear to follow from more general considerations and thus they should be applicable to the more complicated cases .",
    "we thank m. droz , p. hantz , l. szilgyi , and m. zrnyi for useful discussions . this work has been supported by hungarian research funds ( grants otka t 029792 and fkfp-0128/1997 ) .",
    "in addition to the spacing law , there is also a time - law and width law .",
    "the former states that the time of appearance @xmath108 of the @xmath97 band is related to the position of the band by @xmath109 while the latter relates the width and the position of the bands ( @xmath110 ) ."
