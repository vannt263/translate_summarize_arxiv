    "the study of the probability distribution of the primordial density fluctuations in the universe is one of the most fundamental challenges in the present day cosmology .",
    "the determination of this probability distribution could constrain the ensemble of cosmological theories of the formation of primordial density fluctuations . in particular ,",
    "standard inflationary theories establish that these density fluctuations are gaussianly distributed @xcite .",
    "so the detection of some non - gaussian features would question these kinds of theories .",
    "a powerful tool in the determination of cosmological parameters is the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the primordial density fluctuations left their imprint in the cmb because of the thermal equilibrium existing before matter  radiation decoupling . in this manner",
    ", the initial density fluctuations led to anisotropies in the cmb , and these inherited the probability distribution of the former . in short , testing cmb gaussianity is equivalent to testing the gaussianity of the primordial fluctuations and hence the validity of standard inflation .    for these reasons there is great interest in the implementation of statistical methods to analyse the gaussianity of current and future cmb data . a representative sample of these methods ( containing real - space statistics , wavelets and fourier - based analyses )",
    "have been recently applied to probe the gaussianity of the data from the wmap mission @xcite .    in this paper , we shall concentrate on the smooth tests of goodness of fit developed by @xcite .",
    "these methods have been already adapted to cmb data analysis , and applied @xcite to the study of the gaussianity of maxima data @xcite .",
    "we further adapt this method here to deal with data from interferometers .    with their intrinsic stability ( only the correlated signal is detected ) and their ability to reject atmospheric signals ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "interferometers have proved their worth in ground - based observations of the cmb . over the last few years",
    "several interferometers have provided high - sensitivity measurements of the power spectrum at intermediate angular scales . in particular , these experiments include the very small array ( vsa , @xcite ) , dasi @xcite and cbi @xcite ; for a more detailed compilation of interferometric experiments measuring the cmb , e.g. @xcite .",
    "these instruments sample the fourier modes of the measured intensity , so they provide a direct measurement of the power spectrum on the sky and allow us to study the gaussianity directly in harmonic space .",
    "non - gaussianity analyses have been already performed on interferometer datasets @xcite . in the first case",
    "these analyses are mainly based on real - space statistics ( they are applied to the maximum - entropy reconstructed maps in real space ) ; while in the second case , the analysis is performed in fourier space by computing the bispectrum in a similar way to the computation of the power spectrum .",
    "we follow the second approach and present here the smooth tests of goodness - of - fit adapted to the study of the gaussianity of interferometric data directly in the visibility space , so we test directly the gaussian nature of the fourier modes on the sky .    since an interferometer measures complex quantities ( visibilities ) , we present two different analyses in this paper , one on the real and imaginary parts , and another on the phases .",
    "the experimental data are a combination of the signal plus noise . in principle",
    ", it would be desirable to analyse data in which signal dominates over the noise ; that is , data with a high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "one suitable approach to select only data with high signal - to - noise ratio is the transformation of the data into signal - to - noise eigenmodes @xcite .",
    "this formalism allows us to eliminate the data dominated by noise .",
    "moreover , as we explain below , the signal - to - noise eigenmodes are not correlated , allowing the direct implementation of the method .    as it is shown below",
    ", our method looks for deviations with respect to the null hypothesis ( gaussianity ) in statistics related to the measured moments ( mean , variance , skewness , kurtosis , ... ) of the visibility signal - to - noise eigenmodes .",
    "thus , it is clear that the test is specially tailored for detecting non - gaussian signals directly in the fourier domain .",
    "this gaussianity analysis of the fourier components completes the analysis of gaussianity in the real space , given that some non - gaussian detection in the fourier space could indicate some degree of non - gaussianity in the real space and vice versa ( a linear transformation of gaussian variables is also gaussian ) .",
    "in fact , for example , the analysis of gaussianity directly in the fourier space by means of the bispectrum has demonstrated to be a powerful tool in the detection of the @xmath1 parameter @xcite .",
    "then , the analysis in fourier space could detect non - gaussianity that , in principle , should be more evident in real space . as an illustration of this fact , we will show how our method detects the non - gaussianity of a cosmic strings map directly in fourier space , even though it seems more natural to search the non - gaussian features of these objects in real space .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "smooth tests of goodness - of - fit are introduced in section [ section_2 ] .",
    "we focus our interest in the statistics developed by @xcite and their application to the gaussian and uniform distributions that we are going to test . in section [ section_3 ]",
    "signal - to - noise eigenmodes are reviewed and applied to the case of interferometer observations .",
    "the simulations we are using are described in section [ sec : vsa ] , where the very small array ( vsa ) is taken as a reference experiment .",
    "the application to gaussian simulations is described in section [ sec : gauss ] .",
    "the power of the test in discriminating between gaussian and non - gaussian signals affected by gaussian noise is studied in section [ section_4 ] .",
    "we consider three kinds of non - gaussian simulations : those performed using the edgeworth expansion introduced by @xcite , a string simulation created by @xcite and @xmath2 simulations with a @xmath1 coupling parameter .",
    "finally , section [ section_5 ] is dedicated to discussion and conclusions .",
    "in this section we present the smooth tests of goodness - of - fit and the work of @xcite applied to a gaussian and a uniform variable .",
    "let us suppose @xmath3 independent realizations , @xmath4 , of a statistical variable @xmath5 ( @xmath6 .",
    "our aim is to test whether the probability density function of @xmath5 is equal to a prefixed function @xmath7 .",
    "the smooth tests of goodness - of - fit are constructed to discriminate between the predetermined function @xmath7 and another that deviates smoothly from the former and is called the _ alternative density function_. we consider an alternative density function given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a parameter vector whose @xmath10th component is @xmath11 and there exists a value @xmath12 such that @xmath13 .",
    "the alternative function deviates smoothly from @xmath7 when @xmath9 is displaced from @xmath12 .",
    "the probability density function of the @xmath3 independent realizations of @xmath5 is given by @xmath14 .",
    "given these realizations , we calculate the estimated value of @xmath9 by means of the maximum likelihood method and denote this value by @xmath15 .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 is defined such that    @xmath17    where @xmath16 is a measurement of the difference between @xmath15 and @xmath12 and is therefore a test of the hypothesis that @xmath18 .",
    "assuming @xmath15 to be close to @xmath12 and @xmath3 to be very large ( @xmath19 ) , the quantity @xmath16 is equal to the so - called _ score statistic _ @xcite ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the vector whose components are @xmath22 , with the log - likelihood function defined as @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is the transposed vector of @xmath25 and the components of the matrix @xmath26 are equal to @xmath27 .    among all the possible choices of alternative density functions",
    ", we select that presented in the work of @xcite .      in the work of @xcite",
    "an alternative density function is defined as    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is a normalization constant and the @xmath30 functions are orthonormal on @xmath31 with @xmath32 ( note that @xmath33 ) .",
    "it can be demonstrated that the score statistic associated with the @xmath34 alternative is given by    @xmath35    note that the previous @xmath36 quantity is not the @xmath10th component of the vector @xmath25 in expression ( [ eq:001 ] ) ( although they are closely related ) .",
    "we denote the two quantities with the same letter to follow the notation of @xcite .",
    "as equation ( [ eq:001 ] ) shows , the expression ( [ eq:004 ] ) gives the score statistic only when the distribution of the data is @xmath7 ( because the condition @xmath37 is imposed ) . in this case",
    "( that is , when the distribution of the data is equal to the prefixed one ) , the @xmath38 statistic is distributed as @xmath39 when @xmath19 .",
    "this holds because @xmath36 is gaussianly distributed when @xmath19 ( the central limit theorem ) .",
    "moreover , it is easy to prove that the mean value of @xmath40 is equal to unity , independently of the value of @xmath3 .",
    "we see that we can work with the @xmath38 quantities or alternately with @xmath40 ( if the distribution of the data is equal to @xmath7 , these are distributed following a @xmath41 function ) .    in this paper",
    "we apply these statistics to two cases : on one hand , to the real and imaginary parts of the visibilities and on the other hand to the phases of the visibilities . in the first case ,",
    "the function @xmath7 is a gaussian distribution , and in the second case the distribution is a uniform .      if @xmath7 is a gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance , the @xmath30 functions are the normalized hermite  chebyshev polynomials @xmath42 with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and , for @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath40 statistics are given by : @xmath48 ^ 2   /24",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 is the estimated moment of order @xmath50 .",
    "bearing in mind the relation between the @xmath40 and the @xmath38 quantities , we see that the statistic @xmath38 is related to moments of order @xmath51 , so that this test is _ directional _ ; that is , it indicates how the actual distribution deviates from gaussianity . for example , if @xmath52 and @xmath53 are small and @xmath54 is large .",
    "the data then have a large @xmath55 value because of the relation between @xmath55 and @xmath54 .",
    "then , the data have a large skewness value .",
    "this holds for all distributions and not only for the gaussian case .",
    "these expressions ( or the equivalent @xmath38 ) are used in @xcite to test the gaussianity of the maxima data .",
    "the skewness and the kurtosis of these data are constrained in @xcite using the same method .",
    "the smooth test of goodness - of - fit applied to the uniform distribution was developed by the first time by @xcite , and his work is the starting point of the work of @xcite .",
    "if we want to test whether @xmath7 is a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath56 $ ] , we define @xmath57 and then we test if @xmath58 is a uniform variable in @xmath59 $ ] . in this case",
    "we take the legendre polynomials : @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath46 .",
    "thus the normalized functions are @xmath63 with @xmath64 . in this case :    @xmath65 ^ 2 /64",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath66 . as in the gaussian variable case",
    ", we see that the test is directional : deviations in the estimated moments @xmath67 from the expected values for a uniform distribution give deviations in the statistics .",
    "if we assume a small field size ( where the flat - sky approximation of the observed region is valid ) , an interferometer measures complex visibilities at a frequency @xmath68 ( the van cittert  zernicke theorem ) : @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the angular position of the observed point on the sky and @xmath71 is a baseline vector in units of the wavelength of the observed radiation ( monochromatic radiation is assumed , and hereinafter we omit the dependence on the frequency , @xmath68 ) .",
    "@xmath72 is the primary beam of the antennas ( normalized to @xmath73 ) , and the function @xmath74 is the brightness distribution on the sky , which can be easily translated into temperature contrast values @xmath75 for the case of the cmb .",
    "if we denote by @xmath76 the fourier transform of @xmath77 and by @xmath78 the cmb power spectrum ( in units of brightness , @xmath79 ) then the correlations between the visibilities observed at @xmath80 and @xmath81 are given by    @xmath82    where @xmath83 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath76 .",
    "these quantities can be computed semi - analytically as described in @xcite , who show how to perform a maximum - likelihood analysis to extract the cmb power spectrum from interferometer observations .",
    "note that for the common case in which the primary beam can be approximated by a gaussian function @xmath84 , it can be demonstrated that the real and the imaginary parts of the observed complex visibilities are uncorrelated and thus independent , if the gaussianity of the cmb holds .",
    "our aim is to test if the visibilities are gaussianly distributed .",
    "this can be done by analysing the real and imaginary parts of the visibilities or studying their phases .",
    "the following subsections explain how we work with the data .",
    "we work with signal - to - noise eigenmodes as they are defined in the work of @xcite .",
    "let us suppose an observed variable @xmath85 , where the subscript @xmath34 denotes a pixel or a position in the space where that variable is defined ( for example the real or the imaginary parts of the visibility @xmath86 are measured in the position @xmath87 of the called @xmath0 space ) .",
    "this variable is the sum of a signal and a noise component ( @xmath88 ) whose respective correlation matrices have components given by @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the brackets indicate average to many realizations .",
    "the signal - to - noise eigenmodes are defined by    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the called _ square root matrix _ of the noise correlation matrix ( i.e. @xmath93 ) and @xmath94 is the rotation matrix which diagonalizes the matrix @xmath95 .",
    "the eigenvalues of this diagonalization are denoted by @xmath96 . in the case we are studying",
    ", the noise has zero mean and is not correlated , i.e.   @xmath97 , so the components of @xmath92 are @xmath98 .",
    "( [ eq:003 ] ) gives us _ transformed _ signal and noise @xmath99 and @xmath100 such that : @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "so , the correlation matrix of @xmath104 is given by @xmath105 with @xmath106 .",
    "we now have a clear characterization of the signal - to - noise relation of our ( transformed ) data .",
    "the noise dominates over the signal if @xmath107 .",
    "so signal - to - noise eigenmodes @xmath104 with a very low value of the associated eigenvalue @xmath96 are very much dominated by the noise and we do not want to include them in our analysis . this is the main interest of this approach , but there is another interesting point : the signal - to - noise eigenmodes are uncorrelated data .",
    "this latter fact will be very useful in the application of the tests of gaussianity described in this paper as explained in the next subsection .",
    "we write the visibilities in terms of their real and imaginary parts : @xmath108    testing the gaussianity of the visibilities is equivalent to testing the joint gaussianity of their real and imaginary parts . as indicated above , when the primary beam is gaussian , the real and imaginary parts are independent if the gaussianity of the cmb holds .",
    "our data to be analysed are the set of real parts of the visibilities which are correlated among them ( that is : @xmath109 ) and imaginary parts which also are correlated ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "moreover , we only have one realization .",
    "the test here presented works with a large amount of independent data ( see the hypothesis in the deduction of the score statistic , section 2 ) . to convert our correlated ( and then dependent ) data to a sample of independent data we proceed in the following way .",
    "given the real part of the visibilities , we perform the transformation in signal - to - noise eigenmodes ( expression [ eq:003 ] ) and define the variable @xmath111    these new data are uncorrelated and normalized ( zero mean , unit dispersion ) .",
    "we operate in the same way with the imaginary parts and add the resulting quantities to those obtained with the real parts .",
    "finally , we have the @xmath112 data ( @xmath113number of visibilities ) which are uncorrelated and normalized . moreover , if the visibility distribution is multinormal then the @xmath114 data are independent and gaussian distributed with zero mean and unit dispersion . then",
    ", if gaussianity holds , the @xmath112 data fulfill the hypothesis of the smooth tests of goodness - of - fit and their @xmath40 statistics must have a @xmath115 distribution .",
    "the test is then applied to the @xmath114 quantities .",
    "the analysis can be performed on the visibility phases .",
    "it is well - known that if the visibility , @xmath116 , is gaussianly distributed , its phase has a uniform distribution .",
    "the phases of the visibilities are not independent because there are correlations of the real parts among themselves , and among the imaginary parts ( the real and imaginary parts are not correlated if the primary beam is a gaussian function ) .",
    "thus , and for the case of a gaussian primary beam , given two points @xmath117 and @xmath118 in the @xmath0 plane , the joint probability of finding the phase value @xmath119 in @xmath117 and @xmath120 in @xmath118 is given by    @xmath121    where :    @xmath122    thus @xmath123 .",
    "as an example , we have calculated the form of the previous probability for the particular case @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the plot is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .     and",
    "@xmath120 in the positions @xmath117 and @xmath118.,width=321 ]    the statistics of subsection 2.3 can not be applied directly to the phases because these are not independent .",
    "we therefore construct a related independent quantities in the following way .",
    "we decorrelate the different visibilities so that , under the assumption of gaussianity , they will be independent . to do this we proceed as in the previous section : we decorrelate the real parts of the visibilities . that transformation gives us the quantities @xmath126 .",
    "we proceed in the same way with the imaginary parts and obtain the associated quantities @xmath127 . in this way",
    ", we have the complex number @xmath128 .",
    "these quantities are independent for different @xmath10 .",
    "we calculate the phase of each one and apply to them the statistics explained in subsection 2.3 for a uniform variable .",
    "to illustrate the method described above , in what follows we apply it to simulated observations with the very small array .",
    "the vsa is a 14-element heterodyne interferometer array , operating at frequencies between 28 and 36 ghz with a 1.5 ghz bandwidth and a system temperature of approximately 30  k , sited at 2400  m altitude at the teide observatory in tenerife ( see @xcite for a detailed description ) .",
    "it can be operated in two complementary configurations , referred as the compact array ( which probes the angular range @xmath129 150900 ; see @xcite for observations in this configuration ) and the extended array ( @xmath130 = 3001500 ; see @xcite and @xcite for observations in this configuration ) . for the simulations in this paper",
    ", we will use as a template experiment the extended array configuration , which corresponds to the antenna arrangement shown in figure [ fig_ant ] .",
    "the observing frequency is 33  ghz , and the primary beam at this frequency has a fwhm of 2.1@xmath131 ( corresponding to a @xmath132 diameter of the aperture function of @xmath133 ) . for the vsa",
    ", the shape of the antenna can be approximated by a gaussian function , so we can calculate the correlation matrix using the expressions ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) presented in @xcite .     to a tilting table hinged along its northern edge . ]",
    "we use a template observation corresponding to @xmath1344  hr integration time , and we explore several values of @xmath135 .",
    "the corresponding noise level will be simulated by adding to each visibility a random gaussian number with an amplitude of @xmath1368  jy per visibility ( one channel , one polarization ) in an integration time of 1  min , to reproduce the observed sensitivity of the vsa .",
    "thus , in a single day s 4  hr observation we get an rms of @xmath13654  mjy / beam in the real - space map .",
    "a simulated 1 day vsa file typically contains  25000 64 s visibilities . in order to perform the analyses here ,",
    "we proceed to bin these data into cells of a certain size , as described in @xcite . for the analyses carried out in this paper ,",
    "we have used a bin size of 9@xmath137 , where @xmath137 is the wavelength of the measured signal , which is similar to that used for the power spectrum evaluation in @xcite .",
    "we have explored different values of the bin size , and the number has been chosen according to two criteria .",
    "if the bin size is too small , the signal - to - noise ratio per pixel is very low . on the other hand , for large bin sizes",
    ", the number of binned visibilities is too small to apply the test .",
    "the value of 9@xmath137 provides both a reasonable number of visibilities and good power in the detection .",
    "nevertheless , we have checked that small variations in this number ( using values from 9 to 14@xmath137 ) do not produce significant changes .",
    "our template observation of the vsa contains a total of 895 visibility points after binning in 9@xmath137 cells .",
    "this template will be used throughout the paper .",
    "in this section we calibrate the method by using simulated gaussian observations .",
    "it can be shown that the correlation matrix of the real parts of the visibilities can be written as @xmath138 with @xmath139 , where @xmath140 are the signal - to - noise eigenvalues and @xmath141 is the rotation matrix defined in subsection [ sec:002 ] . to generate gaussian simulations with the desired correlation we start with a set @xmath142 ( @xmath143number of visibilities ) .",
    "the real parts of the visibilities are given by @xmath144 .",
    "in an analogous way we construct @xmath145 . after that",
    ", a gaussian realization of the noise is added to each visibility .",
    "given the simulated visibilities we decorrelate their real and imaginary parts as explained in subsection [ sec:002 ] .",
    "after that , we calculate the distributions of the @xmath40 quantities ( subsection [ sec:001 ] )",
    ". as we have gaussian simulations , if the amount of data is relatively large , these distributions must be very close to @xmath41 functions as it is explained above .",
    "the form of the distributions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and they are compared with @xmath41 functions normalized to the number of simulations used ( dashed line ) .",
    "we have used 10000 simulations of a vsa field , with a noise level corresponding to @xmath146  hr for each one .",
    "this is the typical noise level achieved in a single - field vsa observation @xcite .",
    "we bin these data using a cell size of 9@xmath137 , to obtain 895 binned visibilities . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] the mean value and the standard deviation ( @xmath147 ) of the distributions is compared with the same quantities of the @xmath41 distribution .    as mentioned above , the mean value of the @xmath40 must be equal to 1 independently of the number of data . from table",
    "[ tab1 ] we see that the convergence to this value is very accurate .",
    "the value of the standard deviation must be @xmath148 only when the number of data tends to infinity ( asymptotic case ) . in the case",
    "we are simulating ( 895 visibilities ) we see that the values of the standard deviation are very close to the @xmath41 values ( only @xmath149 seems to separate slightly from the asymptotic value ) .",
    "the vsa fields we are analysing have a number of visibilities between @xmath1361000 and @xmath1364000 and then the approximation to the @xmath41 functions will be better than the case shown in table [ tab1 ] . because of that , we can approximate the @xmath40 to @xmath41 distributions in a very accurate way .",
    "we then suppose the distributions to be @xmath41 for the @xmath40 statistics or @xmath39 for the @xmath38 .",
    "we have applied to these simulations the method described for the phases and we also find @xmath41 distributions for the @xmath40 statistics .",
    "the advantage of this assumption is that we do not have to make simulations to calculate the statistical distributions for every vsa field for the gaussian or uniform null hypothesis .",
    "we have checked that the distribution of the @xmath40 statistics is also very close to @xmath41 functions even when the number of data is @xmath136200 . in the following sections we cut data with low signal - to - noise eigenvalues and",

    "in this section , given our template of a vsa observation , we generate non - gaussian simulations of the visibilities and add the ( gaussian ) vsa noise to them .",
    "we analyse three kinds of non - gaussian simulations .",
    "first , we consider simulations created by means of the edgeworth expansion in the visibility space ; in second place , we analyse a cosmic strings simulation ; finally , @xmath2 simulations are considered as an exercise to estimate the power of the test to constrain the @xmath1 parameter .    in order to characterize the power of the method in each of these cases",
    ", we use the `` power of the test '' .",
    "roughly speaking , the power , @xmath154 , of a given test at a certain significance level @xmath50 ( @xmath155 ) is parameterized as the area of the alternative distribution function outside the region which contains the @xmath156 area of distribution function of the null hypothesis ( the gaussian case ) .",
    "thus , a large value of @xmath154 for a prefixed small value of @xmath50 indicates that the two distributions have a small overlap , so we can distinguish between them ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for definiteness , in what follows we adopt for the significance levels the values @xmath157 ( i.e. significance levels of 5% and 1% respectively ) , so we shall quote these pair of values for each one of the cases considered .",
    "we first construct simulations with a certain degree of non - gaussianity by using the edgeworth expansion @xcite .",
    "we then analyse these simulations and calculate the power of the test to discriminate between a gaussian distribution ( the null hypothesis ) and a distribution with skewness and kurtosis injected via the edgeworth expansion ( the alternative hypothesis ) .",
    "the aim is to quantify which signal - to - noise level is required to detect a certain degree of non - gaussianity in the data with our method .",
    "we have two options in preparing these simulations : we can inject the skewness and kurtosis either in real space or in visibility space . if we include the non - gaussianity through the edgeworth expansion in real space , this non - gaussianity is diluted when we transform to the fourier ( or visibility ) space ( this is illustrated in appendix a ) .",
    "thus , we decide to inject the skewness / kurtosis directly in fourier space , and calibrate our method in terms of the ability to detect deviations of the moments of the signal - to - noise eigenmodes of the visibilities with respect to the gaussian case .",
    "a similar approach has been adopted by other authors ( e.g. in @xcite they explore the non - gaussianity of the visibilities simultaneously to the estimation of the power spectrum , by using a modified non - gaussian likelihood function ) .    to use non - gaussian simulations with given skewness / kurtosis in fourier space generated from the edgeworth expansion is not motivated by any physical model , but it is a reasonable approach to calibrate the power of a non - gaussianity test because these non - gaussian maps are easy to prepare with specified statistical properties . moreover",
    ", systematic effects could introduce a non - gaussian signal in the visibilities which could be mimic with the edgeworth expansion .",
    "the probability distribution of these systematic effects could be , for example , asymmetric and , in a first approximation , this fact can be modeled by a distribution with a non - zero skewness .",
    "in addition , the distribution could be more peaked or flat that the gaussian one , and that can be modeled by a distribution with a non - zero kurtosis . in this manner",
    "the edgeworth simulations are taken as a benchmark to quantify the power of our method to detect some kind of non - gaussian signals .",

    "when we introduce some degree of non - gaussianity ( skewness or kurtosis ) by means of the edgeworth expansion in the visibilities , it is clear that each eigenmode will show a different degree of non - gaussianity which will depend on the associated signal - to - noise eigenvalue .",
