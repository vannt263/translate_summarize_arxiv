    "creation of entangled states is essential for quantum computation and communication where most qubit operations can not be performed through the manipulation of separable states @xcite . since the electron spin is a natural two - level system the production and manipulation of spin qubit pair entanglement attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "two electron spin qubits , each localized in one of two adjacent semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) , can be coupled via the heisenberg exchange interaction due to virtual electron tunneling between the dots @xcite .",
    "the description of electrons by the spin degrees of freedom alone is a simplification valid when the electrons are localized and the charge fluctuations are negligible . in general , in any realistic solid - state device , spin entanglement is closely connected to the orbital degrees of freedom of the carriers which can be traced out if not measured @xcite .",
    "following the analysis of the use of entangled electron spin pairs in solid - state structures @xcite , an intense activity was aimed toward understanding the physical mechanisms that produce spin - entangled electrons in mesoscopic conductors .",
    "the coherent manipulation of a single electron spin in a qd and the controlled correlation of two spins located in isolated dots have already been demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "the interaction of qubit pairs with the environment is in general a complicated many - body process and its understanding is essential for experimental and theoretical solid - state qubits @xcite .",
    "such a system is often represented by a two - level system , or spin-1/2 , interacting with an otherwise homogeneous , and often one - dimensional medium with gapless excitations .",
    "some versions of this model are equivalent to the kondo model , motivating studies of ground state entanglement of an impurity spin with the conduction electrons and the role of the kondo effect . this entanglement can be easily expressed exactly in terms of the impurity magnetization @xcite .",
    "it was found that the kondo effect plays a significant role in spin qubit double - quantum dot ( dqd ) @xcite .",
    "recently , the transport properties of triple quantum dots ( tqd ) in various configurations have been investigated @xcite . in a serial tqd ,",
    "different kondo regimes can be sampled by measuring the conductance .",
    "the transition from local - moment to molecular - orbital regime can be observed in the evolution of correlation functions @xcite . in a system containing a central interacting dot c attached to the leads and two non - interacting dots @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ", there is a sizable splitting of the kondo resonance @xcite and a two - stage screening of the magnetic moment was found .",
    "the inter - dot hopping introduces the kondo - assisted transport and may induce a quantum phase transition @xcite . the possibility of a robust underscreened kondo effect in tqd",
    "has also been recently discussed @xcite .    in this work",
    "we concentrate on thermodynamic and transport properties and their relation to entanglement for three electrons confined in three adjacent dots forming a ring ; one of the dots is attached to metallic leads , fig .",
    "we study the case in which the dots are singly occupied on average .",
    "the kondo effect can switch on the entanglement due to the interplay between the inter - dot spin - spin correlations and various kondo - like ground states .",
    "we find conditions for entangled and unentangled states between the dots .",
    "the results differ from those in the dqd configurations in which the kondo interaction reduces the entanglement between the dqd qubits @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "ii introduces the model and numerical method . in sec .",
    "iii numerical results are presented and summarized in a phase diagram and effective model in sec .",
    "we consider a solid - state qubit system built from a triangular tqd . we model it by the three - impurity anderson hamiltonian .",
    "the concurrence will be used as the measure of spin entanglement @xcite .",
    "we tune the parameters so that each dot is approximately singly occupied .",
    "the total spin is conserved in this system , thus the concurrence is related to spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "the hamiltonian has three parts : @xmath2 .",
    "the isolated dots are described by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the occupation of dot @xmath5 with spin @xmath6",
    ". only one energy level @xmath7 is taken into account in each quantum dot  other levels are assumed to be much higher in energy .",

    "the hybridization strength is @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    to properly describe the kondo effect @xcite",
    ", impurity problems need to be solved using nonperturbative methods , such as the numerical renormalization - group ( nrg ) . the nrg @xcite consists of a logarithmic discretization of the continuum of states of the conduction - band electrons , followed by a mapping to a one - dimensional chain hamiltonian with exponentially decreasing hopping constants . as a consequence of the logarithmic discretization ,",
    "the hopping along the chain decreases exponentially , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the discretization parameter and @xmath29 is the index of the site in the chain .",
    "this provides the opportunity to diagonalize the chain hamiltonian iteratively and to keep only the states with the lowest lying energy eigenvalues , since the energy scales are separated . knowing the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues",
    ", we can calculate thermodynamical and dynamical quantities directly ( _ e.g. _ , spectral functions using their lehmann representation ) .",
    "the method is reliable and rather accurate .",
    "calculations in this work are performed with a discretization parameter @xmath30 , four values of the twist parameter @xmath31 , and the truncation energy cutoff of @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the characteristic energy scale at the nth nrg iteration .",
    "since the nrg is a well - established numerical method with a relatively broad literature , we do not give the details of the implementation here but refer to ref . @xcite .",
    "in this work we use the nrg ljubljana code @xcite .",
    "our goal is to analyse the entanglement of a qubit subsystem attached to external reservoir .",
    "a similar study of dqds has shown that at low temperatures and low magnetic field , the kondo effect acts as a source of entanglement destruction @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , in the present triple quantun dot system , the kondo effect enables the entanglement , as shown in the following",
    ".    quantum entanglement of two - qubits in a pure state @xmath34 can customarily be quantified by the wootters concurrence @xcite @xmath35 two qubits are fully entangled , @xmath36 , if they are in one of the bell states : @xmath37 or @xmath38 .    in tqd ,",
    "the qubits are coupled to a fermionic bath , therefore the two - qubit system ab is in a mixed state and appropriate generalization for concurrence is given by the wootters formula @xcite . moreover , in the system considered there are also charge fluctuations , thus the state may be outside the simple manifold of spin degrees of freedom .",
    "nevertheless , the concurrence can still be consistently defined for such system . in the presence of axial spin symmetry",
    ", it can be given as @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the electron spin raising operator for dot @xmath41 , @xmath1 and @xmath42 is the projection operator onto the subspace where dot @xmath43 is singly occupied by one electron with the spin @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 are probabilities for the spins to be aligned in the same ( parallel ) and opposite ( antiparallel ) directions , respectively .",

    "each of the dots is almost perfectly singly occupied .",
    "it should be noted that contrary to some double qd systems here exact single occupancy of identical dots in general can not be achieved for a common value of @xmath77 since the system is asymmetric and , furthermore , it is not particle - hole symmetric due to the lack of bipartiteness of the lattice .",

    "similar behavior , known as a dark - spin state , occurs in tqd ring in presence of an in - plane electric field due to decoupling of the spin in one of the dots @xcite . on the other hand , for @xmath86 ,",
    "the concurrence is zero and ferromagnetic correlations between dots @xmath0 and @xmath1 dominate , forming an effective @xmath87 impurity at low temperatures which undergoes partial kondo screening , yielding a residual uncompensated spin-@xmath88 .",
    "in addition to the concurrence , spin and charge correlation functions , abrupt changes also occur in thermodynamic properties . in fig .",

    "this is the reason for different behavior of critical @xmath136 and @xmath137 in this regime .    in summary ,",
    "the spin entanglement of electron pairs in a triangular tqd , one dot being attached to non - interacting leads , is quantitatively analyzed in the regime of two competing many - body effects , namely the kondo effect and the direct exchange interaction .",
    "in contrast to dqd configurations in which the kondo effect suppresses the entanglement @xcite , in this case , the kondo effect  in which a single spin in the dot c is screened by conduction electrons in an attached metallic lead - induces entanglement between the spins in the dots @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "there are two regimes of interest , depending on the ratio of the interdot couplings @xmath138 . on the one hand , for @xmath139 , spins in the dots @xmath0 and @xmath1 are always maximally entangled and the central dot c is in the kondo regime with conduction leads , thus the entanglement is switched on due to the kondo effect . for stronger interaction regime @xmath140",
    "this result is expected as a consequence of the quantum phase transition observed in tqd with triangular topology @xcite .",
    "our analysis reveals that the switching between unentangled and perfectly entangled qubit pairs @xmath0 and @xmath1 persists also in the regime of substantial charge fluctuations , either @xmath103 or @xmath101 . in the regime of low @xmath110 there is a strong renormalization of @xmath141 , which can be understood within a simple analytically solvable pure spin model where the tqd is anti - ferromagnetically coupled to an additional singly occupied quantum dot .",
    "the induction of the singlet formation @xmath61-@xmath127 acts as switching of the entanglement between the dots @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a similar manner as the formation of the kondo singlet in the original tqd system analyzed numerically .",
