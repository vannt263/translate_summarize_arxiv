    "the cores of galaxy clusters have been a long standing puzzle since the early x - ray observations . initially gas in the cores of clusters was thought to cool , condense , and flow toward the center , as long as the cooling time was less than the age of the universe .",
    "most ( @xmath22/3 ) galaxy clusters in the local universe satisfy this condition , with early estimates of their accretion rates as high as @xmath3 .",
    "the problem with this interpretation was that the mass sink for all this supposedly cooling and condensing gas has never been found ( the classical cooling flow problem or  mass - sink problem  , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "x - ray observations with  and  have established that there is little evidence for emission from gas cooling below @xmath2/3 ( the new ",
    "spectroscopic @xmath4 problem ",
    "just when gas should be cooling most rapidly it appears not to be cooling at all ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "a compensating heat source must therefore resupply the radiative losses and many possibilities have been proposed , including thermal conduction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , energy released by mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and heating by an active agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "agn feedback heating has become the most appealing solution to the problem ( for a recent and detailed review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the following reasons : 1 ) the high incidence of clusters with short central cooling times means they can not be a transient phenomenon , requiring a heating rate which closely matches the cooling rate .",
    "this is difficult to explain , unless heating rates are coupled to cooling rates .",
    "agn feedback is a natural vehicle to provide the coupling if the agn is fed by cooled or cooling gas @xcite ; 2 ) there is clear observational evidence for agn heating in cool core clusters , since a majority ( @xmath271% ) harbour radio sources @xcite .",
    "following the launch of , `` cavities '' in the icm of a similar fraction of cool core clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been found which correlate with the radio emission of the central agn .",
    "these have been interpreted as bubbles of relativistic plasma inflated by the radio jets causing @xmath5 heating @xcite .",
    "together with weak shocks associated with the outburst , long expected in models of jet - fed radio lobes @xcite and finally detected in deep  observations , as for example , in m87 @xcite , hydra a @xcite and ms 0735 + 7241 @xcite , the energies provided by the agn are not only comparable to those needed to stop gas from cooling , but the mean powers of the outbursts are well correlated with the powers radiated @xcite ; 3 ) agn feedback has broader astrophysical implications for galaxy formation , explaining the truncation of the high end of the galaxy luminosity function and the symbiosis of black holes and spheroids , forming an impressive coherent picture .",
    "but we are far from a clear understanding , since `` some loose ends remain '' @xcite .",
    "entropy can offer more direct insights into the processes that add and remove thermal energy from the gas .",
    "motivated by a study of entropy profiles in a sample of cool core clusters @xcite , @xcite proposed a framework for agn heating in line with the features discussed above and able to explain the observed core entropy profiles with episodic outbursts of @xmath6 erg s@xmath7  occurring on a @xmath8 yr timescale .",
    "stronger outbursts like those seen in hydra a and ms 0735 + 7241 , which are rarer and longer lasting may also play a role in extending the time between outbursts and in elevating the intra - cluster entropy beyond the core region of clusters .",
    "another clue comes from the  observations of two radio - quiet ( at 1.4 ghz in the nvss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) clusters by @xcite : a 1650 and a 2240 .",
    "both clusters were classified as strong cooling flows by @xcite , but their central cooling times ( @xmath9 yr ) are much longer than the central cooling times of cooling flow clusters with current radio activity ( @xmath10 yr ) ; they also have flatter core entropy profiles with larger values of central entropy ( 30 - 40 kev @xmath1 ) compared to ones ( @xmath11 kev @xmath1 ) of the sample with active radio central galaxies .",
    "either the gas in these clusters experienced such a dramatic episode of feedback heating sometime in the past that it has not required any additional feedback for @xmath12 yr or mergers have kept the gas from cooling and condensing appreciably since the central galaxies were formed , as for example shown in the simulations by @xcite .",
    "the fact that signs of agn feedback appear only in those cool cores that currently require feedback has been interpreted as strengthening the case for agn heating . in this scenario",
    "there is a clear dichotomy between active and radio quiet clusters : one would expect the cluster population to bifurcate into systems with strong temperature gradients and feedback and those without either @xcite .",
    "a different scenario for another radio quiet cluster , a 644 , in the sample of @xcite was proposed by @xcite . in that paper",
    "a merger scenario was proposed to explain the properties of the radio - quiet clusters a 644 and a 2589 , which have almost isothermal temperature profiles and abundance profiles that decrease at large radii .",
    "@xcite suggested that the center offsets observed in these clusters ( @xmath1360 kpc a 644 ; @xmath1310 kpc a2589 ) indicated that they are settling down from a past merger event .",
    "the larger offset and central ( 50 kpc ) disturbance in a644 indicates it is at an earlier stage after the merging .",
    "the cluster a2029 could represent an interesting later stage for these objects .",
    "since a2029 has a cool core , a very small center offset ( @xmath134 kpc , smaller than a644 and a2589 ) , with a wat , yet its image morphology is otherwise highly relaxed , cooling has advanced further and the feedback episode has just started .",
    "it is interesting to note that of the objects in @xcite as listed in @xcite lacking either an emission line nebula or a strong radio source , two without emission lines and radio activity ( a 644 and a 1689 , for the latter see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and one with emission lines but a weak radio source ( a 2142 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show signs of merger activity .",
    "in this paper we present the properties of the low - mass cluster awm4 at @xmath14=0.0317 which is a clear counter - example to the dichotomy proposed by @xcite .",
    "all distance - dependent quantities have been computed assuming = 70 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , = 0.3 and = 0.7 . at the redshift of @xmath15 1corresponds to 38 kpc .",
    "all the errors quoted are at the 68% confidence limit .",
    "is a poor cluster whose x - ray emission is extended and regular ( see fig.[fig.source ] ) and the peak of the x - ray emission is coincident with the dominant giant elliptical ngc 6051 .",
    "it has a bolometric luminosity ( 0.1 - 100 kev ) of @xmath16  and a mass weighted temperature of @xmath17 kev within 455 kpc , and a mass of @xmath18  within @xmath19 kpc .",
    "it therefore lies at the low end of the mass and temperature range defining clusters of galaxies .",
    "28 galaxy members have been identified , most are absorption line systems with a strong concentration of early - type galaxies in the center and with a smooth gaussian velocity distribution centered at the velocity of ngc 6051 ; the velocity dispersion of the system is @xmath20 km s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "ngc 6051 is considerably brighter than the galaxies around it and recent deep @xmath21-band imaging ( zibetti et al .",
    ", in preparation ) has established the fossil nature of this system , according to the definition of @xcite .",
    "the  data ( see fig.[fig.profiles ] , upper right panel ) show a clear abundance gradient , from @xmath22   ( in the units of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at 400 kpc to @xmath23 in the inner 20 kpc , another indication of a fairly relaxed system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "ngc 6051 harbors a powerful radio source with 1.4 ghz flux of @xmath24 mjy ( from the nvss catalog , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and spectral index @xmath25 ( calculated using radio fluxes from 26.3 mhz to 10.55 ghz taken from ned and from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) corresponding to a total radio luminosity of @xmath26 erg s@xmath7  in the energy band 10 mhz - 10 ghz .",
    "radio contours taken from the first 1.4 ghz radio image @xcite are also shown in fig.[fig.source ] .    given its relaxed appearance both in the x - ray and in the optical we included the object in our sample of 16 bright relaxed groups / poor clusters observed by either  or  and chosen to be among the candidates best - suited for the application of the hydrostatic equilibrium approximation to measure their mass profiles @xcite , where the details of the analysis of the available   observation of  can be found .",
    "the  data show a unique temperature profile ( see fig.[fig.profiles ] , upper left panel ) for a relaxed object , with an isothermal core out to 200 kpc ( as found also in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and then a decline at large radii .    to characterize quantitatively the entropy profile , determined by computing the adiabatic constant @xmath27 ( see fig.[fig.profiles ] , lower left panel ) , we follow @xcite and fit both a simple power law of the form @xmath28 and the same power law plus a central constant @xmath29 .",
    "we find @xmath30  and @xmath31 with @xmath32/dof = 107/7 for a single power law fit and @xmath33 , @xmath34  and @xmath35 with @xmath32/dof = 7/6 for a power law plus constant fit .",
    "the elevated central entropy of  is reflected in the long central cooling time ( calculated as @xmath36 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* see lower right panel of fig.[fig.profiles ] ) , @xmath37 gyr in the inner bin .",
    "in this regard   shares the same characteristics of the two radio - quiet clusters , a 1650 and a 2244 , of @xcite and would be consistent with the hypothesis that a major past agn outburst has completely erased the cool core .",
    "but the current 1.4 ghz radio activity implies a recent ( not much more than @xmath38 yr ago , the upper limit to the characteristic lifetime , i.e. synchrotron age , of the radio source ) feeding of the central black hole , which is unlikely to come from the ambient hot gas which has an order of magnitude longer cooling time .",
    "the anomalous nature of , compared to the objects in the sample of @xcite , stands out clearly in a plot of central entropy versus 20 cm radio power ( calculated as @xmath39 where @xmath40 , neglecting the k - correction term ) , as it can be seen in fig.[fig.sradio ] .",
    "we did not plot the two radio quiet objects of @xcite because a homogeneous comparison with data at 1.4 ghz is needed : for example a central radio source has been detected in a 1650 with a sensitive observation at 327 mhz by @xcite , but this can be explained as the old remnant of the previous very active agn . on the contrary",
    "the  data for awm 4 suggests a surprising lack of low entropy gas surrounding an active and bright radio source at 1.4 ghz , although they can not rule out its presence at scales smaller than the inner 20 kpc .",
    "for the clusters in the @xcite sample , even though the entropy profiles are more detailed because of the higher spatial resolution of , they still rely on temperature determinations in inner bins with widths ranging from 7 kpc ( a 262 , z=0.0163 ) to 32 kpc ( pks 0745 - 191 , z=0.1028 ) with 4 objects out of 9 with inner bins with width @xmath41 kpc .",
    "our investigation of current  data shows no statistically significant surface brightness or spectral variations in the core at a level greater than @xmath42 ( as it is also the case for the temperature variations quoted in * ? ? ?",
    "* see their table 5 ) . in this section",
    "we will discuss possible scenarios to explain the characteristics of this peculiar source .",
    "there is a clear observational dichotomy between cool core ( cc ) , relaxed clusters and non - cool core ( ncc ) , disturbed clusters .",
    "this is not only based on the central temperature gradient or central cooling time , but also for example on the degree of regularity of morphologies ( as measured by power ratios , which strongly correlates with the strength of the cooling , as measured for local and moderate redshift clusters : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the presence / absence of a central abundance gradient @xcite . a possible new class of objects can include systems like a 1650 and a 2244 , which have all the characteristics of relaxed objects but lack a cool core due to a strong episode of agn feedback .",
    "regardless of this possible last class , it is commonly assumed that mergers can transform cc clusters into ncc ones , depending on factors such as the initial strength of the cooling core , how off - center the merger is and the mass - ratio of the merging system @xcite .",
    "there is still debate and controversial results from simulations regarding the effectiveness of mergers in disrupting cool cores and being responsible for the cc / ncc dichotomy @xcite .",
    "the inability of current hydro - dynamical simulations in reproducing realistic cool cores may be one of the reason for these controversial results . nevertheless , it is crucial to discuss a merger hypothesis for the properties of .",
    "the central radio source has some similarities with a wide - angle - tail ( wat ) source , which it has been argued can be shaped by icm ram pressure produced in cluster mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is a well motivated hypothesis for some of the most relevant cases like the ones presented in @xcite which present clear evidence of disturbed x - ray morphologies , but it can not hold in cases like the one of .",
    "small scale disturbances due to accretion of small mass objects , like the simulations described in @xcite can reproduce the characteristic x - ray spiral structure seen for example in the core of perseus and provide the necessary relative icm motions to explain the wat - like jet bending .",
    "alternatively jet bending can result from instabilities , preexisting radio plasma , as discussed for hydra a @xcite , or by jet precession , as in the spectacular case of the cluster rbs797 @xcite .",
    "a good comparison can be made with the recent  observation of the prototypical wat host cluster a 1446 @xcite : in this cluster there is a complex x - ray morphology in the inner 200 kpc and there is a flat abundance profile , a sensitive indicator of an ongoing merger .",
    "has very different properties in the x - rays and in the optical , in particular its fossil property would be difficult to understand in a recent major merger scenario .",
    "the same conclusion has been reached by @xcite .",
    "clearly given the spatial resolution of the  data , the possibility of the accretion of a low - mass object , like a small group , a cool galaxy corona , able to survive stripping and thermal evaporation @xcite , or even a gas rich dwarf galaxy , can not be ruled out as the cause of cooled gas that triggered the radio jet in .",
    "it is also useful to compare  with the suggested evolutionary scenario discussed in @xcite",
    ". systems like a 644 are just settling down from a major merger to establish the initial cooling / feedback loop and there is no radio emission until the core is basically relaxed .",
    "a possible interpretation is that  would instead have represented the final stage of the cycle of agn feedback , like a 1650 and a 2244 , if it were not for a small - merger / accretion related event .",
    "the limits posed by the  image to the center offset is @xmath43 kpc , but this determination is hampered by low  spatial resolution ( the psf fwhm on - axis corresponds to 2 kpc at the redshift of the source ) .",
    "it is still possible to reason along the lines of the model for example of @xcite but we have to allow the previous agn outflow of @xmath44 ( capable of raising the central entropy to the observed @xmath45 ) of having been not able to completely stop cooling near the very core , much alike the cool coronae observed in ngc 3842 ( in a 1367 ) and ngc 4874 ( in coma ) by @xcite . in these sources",
    "if the agn mechanical power , associated with the observed radio emission , has the same magnitude observed in cool core clusters , it would have completely disrupted the observed x - ray soft coronae .",
    "remaining cooling gas ( or gas supplied by stellar mass loss ) could have triggered the current outburst : assuming the energy released by accretion onto a black hole to be @xmath46@xmath47 with @xmath48 we have @xmath49 , where @xmath50 ; an accretion rate as low as 0.017  could sustain a total mechanical luminosity of @xmath51 , a thousand times higher than the radio luminosity .",
    "measurements of x - ray cavity sizes and surrounding gas pressure have provided unique estimates of the ratio of jet power to synchrotron power .",
    "the jet power determined from x - ray cavity data shows a clear correlation with synchrotron power ( core plus lobes ) ; the median ratio of jet ( cavity ) power to synchrotron power is @xmath52 , with mean @xmath53 owing to large ( ranging from a few to a few thousand ) scatter ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* in particular their fig.7 ) ; this is interestingly on the high side of theoretical expectations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given its current radio luminosity the central radio source in awm 4 can well provide up to @xmath54 erg s@xmath7  of mechanical energy into the icm .",
    "these luminosities would be sufficient to carve x - ray cavities in the icm : if for example the mechanical luminosity associated with the radio jets in awm4 is @xmath55 erg s@xmath7  and assuming an enthalpy of @xmath56 , appropriate for cavities dominated by relativistic particles , and a duration of the outburst of @xmath57 years , the energy created would result in a pair of spherical cavities with radius @xmath133.5 kpc located within @xmath1320 kpc from the center , perhaps coincident with the inner bright radio `` knots '' at 21  ( 13 kpc ) and 34  ( 21 kpc ) from the center .",
    "cavities of these sizes would produce a level of contrast in surface brightness above 30% , which is the contrast of evident bubbles like the ones in a 2052 and hydra a. if cavities are detected in , it would establish that agn mechanical heating has taken place in the past @xmath8 yr , given the fact that any cavities that might be seen today may only have come from the currently visible radio jet : for example the buoyancy time scale for a bubble of 3.5 kpc at r=21 kpc is @xmath58 yr , calculating the gravitational acceleration as @xmath59 using the mass profile derived in @xcite ; using instead @xmath60 where @xmath61km / s @xcite is the stellar velocity dispersion of the central galaxy would result in @xmath62 yr .",
    "another indication of the energy of the previous outburst which has disrupted the cool core of  comes from the analysis of @xcite . by comparing",
    "the observed peaked iron abundance profile for a sample of groups and clusters , including perseus , with the prediction of a simple model invoking the metal ejection from the bcg and the subsequent diffusion of metals by stochastic gas motions , they found for  the largest value of the diffusion coefficient , implying the strongest level of gas mixing .",
    "provides an early critical test to the new born theory of agn feedback , and it exposes our poor understanding of the details of the fueling and triggering of agn outbursts , including the part , if any , played by mergers , as for example highlighted in the future issues to be addressed by @xcite .",
    "we must understand the new cycle of heating and cooling of a relaxed galaxy cluster , as depicted for example in the agn feedback loop by @xcite , and its connection to the pre-  loop of mergers and relaxation in cool cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
