    "we report on four measurements by the cdf experiment  @xcite of processes involving heavy quark production . all use data recorded at center of mass energy 1.96 tev at the fermilab tevatron collider during run ii .",
    "the structure of jets derives from the gluon emissions from the primary parton involved . in heavy quark jets ,",
    "the quark decay must be modeled as well as the underlying event .",
    "multi - gluon emission is difficult to calculate so is often approximated by parton shower models .",
    "jet shape is known to depend upon whether the primary parton is a quark or a gluon , and it is also expected to depend upon flavor .",
    "it is expected to depend as well upon the production mechanism ; for example , the @xmath2 and @xmath3 from gluon splitting are expected to be often in the same jet  @xcite , producing a broader jet than does flavor creation .",
    "measurement of jet shapes casts light on all these aspects of jet evolution and heavy flavor production .    to address the question of whether the fraction of @xmath2-jets originating from gluon splitting , and its evolution , is well described by contemporary models ,",
    "we define the jet shape , a measure of the fraction of total jet transverse momentum @xmath4 , inside a given radius in the space of rapidity @xmath5 and azimuthal angle @xmath6 .",
    "this is @xmath7 , the fraction of total @xmath4 in cone @xmath8 carried by particles in subcone @xmath9 , averaged over an ensemble of jets , normalized to 1 , and defined such that @xmath10 and particles outside the cone are excluded .",
    "the @xmath2-jet event selection begins with triggers based solely on calorimeter transverse energy @xmath11 .",
    "trigger level 1 requires one calorimetric trigger tower above a threshold between 5 and 10 gev .",
    "level 2 seeks clusters about the level 1 towers among adjacent towers above 1 gev and requires that at least one cluster exceed a threshold between 15 and 90 gev .",
    "level 3 applies the run 1 cone algorithm  @xcite and imposes @xmath12 greater than 20 to 100 gev .",
    "the jet minimum @xmath4 requirement is set to ensure that only events for which the trigger is @xmath13 efficient are used .",
    "offline the jets are reconstructed by the midpoint cone algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the selection of b - jets is then enhanced by requiring a secondary vertex .",
    "because @xmath2 s tend to be found near the jet axis , the search for them uses a cone of radius @xmath14 in @xmath15 space .",
    "tracks are ranked by reconstruction quality , including the contribution from the distance @xmath16 of closest approach to the primary vertex .",
    "the algorithm next attempts to reconstruct a secondary vertex , beginning with the highest quality track .",
    "if this succeeds , a cut is placed on the significance of the two - dimensional projection along the jet axis of the distance between the primary and secondary vertices .",
    "general event quality cuts follow , including a rejection of multiple interactions ( there must be one and only one primary vertex with @xmath17 cm ) , a rejection of cosmics based on the significance of the missing @xmath18 , and a requirement of jet centrality : @xmath19 .",
    "the jet @xmath20 is corrected to the hadron level by matching hadron and calorimeter level jets in monte carlo , a correction that increases the @xmath20 by 20% to 10% with no change in jet shape .",
    "the requirement of the secondary vertex tag biases the measured jet shapes by demanding clean , well - defined tracks .",
    "an @xmath9-dependent correction for this is needed .",
    "there are additionally corrections for the presence of non-@xmath2 jets misidentified as @xmath2-jets , corrections for detector effects ( for example , the number of calorimeter towers scales with @xmath4 ) , and a correction for the presence of a second @xmath2 quark in the jet .",
    "the data are fitted to two-@xmath2 and one-@xmath2 templates separately . the final function to be fitted",
    "is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the unfolding factor @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the measured jet shape for the tagged sample , @xmath25 is the measured inclusive jet shape , @xmath26 is the purity of @xmath2 s in the tagged jet sample , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 correct for biases to the jet shape arising from the secondary vertex requirement .",
    "the data are compared to predictions by pythia , with tune a  @xcite , and herwig v 6.506  @xcite .",
    "the principle systematics are associated with the choice of monte carlo model , the effect of the calorimeter model , the jet energy calibration , and assumptions about the @xmath29-quark content of the jets .",
    "the results of the study  @xcite , for integrated luminosity 300 pb@xmath30 , are shown in figure  [ unfold2 ] , for 4 bins in @xmath4 . in each bin , the data are compared to the pythia prediction for inclusive jets as well as the pythia and herwig predictions for single @xmath2 production and for single @xmath2 production with the default fraction diminished by 20% .",
    "one sees that the data are incompatible with the inclusive prediction : the jet shapes are evidently influenced by the presence of heavy quarks , and @xmath31-jets are broader .",
    "one also sees that the data jets are broader than the pythia and herwig defaults ; the leading order models underestimate the fraction of @xmath2 s from gluon splitting and the fraction of jets with two @xmath2 s .",
    "-jet shapes for four @xmath4 bins .",
    "the data are shown as open squares where the error bars represent the statistical and total uncertainties .",
    "the statistical uncertainties are smaller than the squares .",
    "the data are compared to pythia tune a ( solid lines ) and herwig ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the uppermost solid curve is the inclusive prediction ; the next solid curve , and the uppermost dashed curve , are the predictions with the default @xmath32 fraction ; and the lowest solid curve and lowest dashed curve are the predictions with the default 1@xmath2 fraction diminished by 20%.[unfold2],width=510 ]",
    "the mechanism for producing heavy vector mesons in hadron collisions is not well understood .",
    "cdf run i data on production cross sections for prompt @xmath34 and @xmath0 were one to two orders of magnitude above predictions by color singlet models .",
    "subsequent theoretical efforts  @xcite with adjusted production matrix elements match the cross section but predict increasing transverse polarization with production @xmath4 that is not confirmed by the data  @xcite .",
    "new approaches  @xcite have been proposed .",
    "the @xmath0 is a good testing ground for studying charmonium hadroproduction as there are no significant charmonium states above it to produce feeddown .",
    "the goal of this study is a measurement of @xmath35 for @xmath36 gev / c .",
    "the data selection begins with muons reconstructed in four layers of the central tracking chamber and matched to three to four hit tracks in the muon detector .",
    "events that pass the dimuon trigger , which requires two opposite sign tracks , each with significant @xmath4 , are required to have three hits in the silicon vertex detector svx ii .",
    "the @xmath0 mass and lifetime are fit with a lifetime function , and requirements are placed on the dimuon mass , @xmath37 gev / c@xmath38 , and rapidity @xmath39 .",

    "the signal is modeled with the crystal ball function  @xcite , a gaussian core with a low side tail .",
    "the mass background is modeled with a first order polynomial . the prompt signal",
    "is separated from the feeddown with a @xmath41-fit . the prompt signal",
    "is given by a double gaussian centered on zero .",
    "the long - lived signal is modeled by an exponential convoluted with a gaussian .",
    "the lifetime background is modeled by a prompt double gaussian plus symmetric , positive-@xmath41 , and negative-@xmath41 long - lived components .",
    "the likelihood function is given by @xmath42 , where the @xmath43 s are fractions of signal ( @xmath44 , from the total number of candidates in the fit ) , prompt ( @xmath45 ) , symmetric long - lived background ( sym ) , positive-@xmath41 long - lived background ( + ) , and negative-@xmath41 long - lived background(- ) .",
    "the @xmath46 s are probability density functions for signal mass @xmath47 , linear mass background @xmath48 , prompt signal double gaussian proper time @xmath49 , an exponential convolved with a gaussian for @xmath2-decay signal @xmath50 , and lifetime backgrounds ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ) .",
    "the efficiency calculation is given by the product of six terms whose values range from 95.3% to 99.9% .",
    "the acceptance calculation is complicated by the fact that acceptance depends upon polarization per @xmath4 bin , yet cdf polarization data on the @xmath0 are too weak for direct application .",
    "the @xmath34 polarization , for which strong cdf data exist , are , however , expected to correlate highly with prompt @xmath0 polarization , so after confirming that the @xmath34 and @xmath0 polarization data are consistent , cdf applies the @xmath34 polarization values to the @xmath0 @xmath4 bins .",
    "monte carlo @xmath0 samples are generated with fixed polarizations at the extreme values of 0 and -1 and with flat distributions in @xmath4 , @xmath54 , and @xmath6 .",
    "these samples are simulated in the cdf detector and reconstructed .",
    "we compute the product of geometrical acceptance and trigger efficiency , @xmath55 , where for @xmath56 generated events , @xmath57 survive geometric and reconstruction requirements and @xmath58 survive the trigger . @xmath59",
    "ranges from 0.0053 to 0.2548 .",
    "we interpolate the data to intermediate polarization values predicted from the @xmath34 data .",
    "the principle systematic uncertainties on this measurement are associated with the luminosity , the reconstruction efficiency , the dimuon trigger efficiency , and the @xmath0 polarization .",
    "the variation of the prescale during the course of collecting integrated luminosity 1.1 fb@xmath30 produces an effective integrated luminosity of 954 pb@xmath30 .",
    "the resulting prompt @xmath0 differential cross section is shown in figure [ gdiff3 ] .",
    "one sees that in all three cases , the run i result is confirmed with an order of magnitude more statistics .",
    "the measured value of @xmath35 is @xmath60  nb . the ratio of the run ii to the run i result , for identical ranges in @xmath4 , is @xmath61 .",

    "continued comparisons , at higher @xmath4 and with increased statistics , may motivate further improvements .",
    "this study considers events whose primary vertex has @xmath17 cm , whose missing @xmath11 is not significant , and whose kinematical variables lie in the range @xmath64 gev / c and @xmath65 , with jets reconstructed with the midpoint cone algorithm and heavy flavor jets tagged via their secondary vertices . the jet energy corrections are based on minimum bias events which measure the @xmath4 deposited in the calorimeter , as a function of the number of primary vertices , and indicate a value of @xmath66 gev / c per extra vertex .",
    "monte carlo events from pythia 6.203 , with tune a and the cteq5l parton distribution function set , are used to correct the measured energy for effects of partially instrumented regions and calorimeter nonlinearities .",
