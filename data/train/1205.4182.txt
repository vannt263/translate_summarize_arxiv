    "the most general qq quantum secret sharing protocol can be understood as a map from a quantum secret state of dimension @xmath0 , @xmath16 to a multipartite state @xmath17 , shared between the players @xmath18 , encoded onto some logical basis @xmath19 , which is designed such that authorised sets of players can access the secret and unauthorised sets of players can not . without loss of generality",
    "we take @xmath20 to be an orthonormal basis .",
    "an encoding onto a non - orthogonal basis can be understood as some preprocessing taking the state input @xmath21 to a state @xmath22 corresponding to the non - orthogonal encoding , and then following the map above . a mixed state encoding can always be purified into a map as above , followed by tracing out of some systems ( in which case the number of active players would be less than @xmath1 , we discuss such examples and their relation to our results in section [ sec : qecc ] ) . in this way",
    "this encoding formally represents the most general scheme .    for any such scheme ,",
    "we extend to rcq sharing classical secrets by introducing what we call a channel state between system @xmath3 held by the dealer and the players systems @xmath18 , which can be thought of as the dealer preparing a maximally entangled state and sending half through the encoding above , latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }   \\label{eqn : channel state }    this is a maximally entangled state between @xmath3 and the players , and can be understood as a channel from the dealer to the players . in the qq case this channel",
    "is used to teleport the secret from the dealer s qubit to the players ( that is , it acts simply as an encoding process for the most general scheme ) . in the rcq case",
    "this channel is used to establish a secure random key between the dealer and the players ( as per the ekert quantum key distribution protocol @xcite ) . in both cases",
    "it is the choice of the logical basis @xmath19 gives rise to the access structure .",
    "the rcq extension we present using this idea covers all known rcq schemes @xcite ( up to possible reordering of public communication steps , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for the rcq extension it will be useful to define generalized pauli operators , that are for prime dimension @xmath0 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , and @xmath0 is the dimension of the secret . for the moment we will consider prime dimensional case and",
    "later we will see how the results also work for non - prime dimension .",
    "we further denote @xmath27 as the eigenstates of @xmath28 for @xmath29 and as the eigenstate of @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "the channel state can then be expanded as @xmath32 are also orthonormal and complementary , that is @xmath33 when @xmath34 .",
    "we will first describe the protocols , then make precise what we mean exactly by authorised and unauthorised sets for both qq and rcq , and security for the rcq protocol in section [ sec : access ] .",

    "the dealer prepares a channel state ( [ eqn : channel state ] ) , then does an extended bell measurement over @xmath3 and @xmath36 and appropriate corrections , leaving the state of the @xmath1 qudits as @xmath37 2 .",
    "the dealer sends qudit @xmath38 of the resultant state to player @xmath38 .",
    "3 .   players in authorised set @xmath5 follow a prescribed decoding operation @xmath39 .",
    "the protocol is then defined by encoding basis @xmath19 , and decoding operations @xmath39 for each authorised set @xmath5 .",

    "[ fig : qq ] ) .    * rcq protocol : * the rcq protocol does not directly distribute a secret classical message from the dealer to the players , rather it is a protocol to establish a secure key between the dealer and the players , such that only authorised sets of players can access the key . in this sense",
    "it may be considered more accurately as secret key sharing .",
    "this key can then be used by the dealer to share a secret message such that it can only be read by authorised sets of players .",
    "the rcq protocol is an extension of those presented in @xcite , to the more general case not necessarily using graph states .",

    "the dealer prepares a channel state ( [ eqn : channel state ] ) and sends qudit @xmath38 to player @xmath38 .",
    "the dealer randomly chooses a @xmath43 and measures qudit @xmath3 among the bases : @xmath44 for @xmath29 or @xmath30 if @xmath31 .",
    "we denote the result @xmath45 .",
    "the state of the players is then projected to @xmath46 3 .   _",

    "the protocol is defined by encoding basis @xmath19 , and measurements @xmath47 for each authorised set @xmath5 . at the end , if the protocol is not aborted during the security step , the dealer and the authorised set share a secure key which can be used to distribute a classical secret securely .",
    "we now define what it means to say sets of players are authorised or unauthorised for both rcq and qq protocols . for later proofs comparing the two protocols it will be useful to also talk about equivalent information theoretic conditions . for this we define the channel @xmath53 from system @xmath36 to subset of players @xmath5 as the encoding procedure in qq giving state ( [ eqn : q secret graph state ] ) followed by tracing out all but the players @xmath5 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : qq ] ) .",
    "we first look at the qq case . + * qq authorised sets * we say a set of players @xmath5 is _ authorised _ if they can perfectly access the quantum secret , that is , if there exists a decoding procedure @xmath39 acting only on those players , which can perfectly recover the secret input state @xmath21 .",
    "if the quantum information is accessible through the channel @xmath53 , then the quantum mutual information between two halves of a maximally entangled state after one half has been sent down the channel is maximal @xcite .",

    "* rcq authorised sets * we say a set of players @xmath5 is _ authorised _ if it can access the secret , that is , if after the dealer has distributed the channel state ( [ eqn : channel state ] ) and measured it ( up to step 2 in the protocol ) , there exists a ( possibly joint ) measurement on their systems which allows them to discover the dealers measurement result @xmath45 for each setting @xmath62 .    to rewrite this in information theoretic language",
    ", it suffices to consider the channel from the dealer to the players @xmath5 , where for each @xmath62 , the dealer sends a specific chosen state @xmath63 to the players encoding the classical information @xmath45 , chosen according to a uniform distribution . the ability , or not , of a set of players to access this classical information is equivalent to them being able to discover the dealer s measurement result in the rcq protocol . in terms of the action of the channel @xmath53 above , this corresponds to a set of inputs @xmath64 , where @xmath65is a fourier transform of rank @xmath0 , @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "that is , each @xmath63 , corresponds to an input state @xmath67 .",
    "thus to verify that this channel works perfectly for each such message , we are interested in the classical information that can be transmitted for a random distribution over the alphabet for a given @xmath62 , which we denote @xmath68 .",
    "we use holevo information defined over a quantum channel @xmath53 by : if the classical information is accessible through the quantum channel @xmath53 perfectly , then the holevo information @xmath69 , which must be true for all @xmath62 , for all authorised sets @xmath5 .",
    "+   + * rcq unauthorised sets * we say a set of players @xmath5 is _ unauthorised _ if the dealer s result @xmath45 is completely denied to them , that is , if the reduced state @xmath60 of those systems has no dependence on @xmath45 for all @xmath62 . in information",
    "theoretic terms , for the channel @xmath53 and the set of inputs above , this is equal to saying that @xmath70 for all @xmath62 .",
    "+   + * rcq security * for rcq protocols there is the additional condition of security .",
    "we say an authorised set @xmath5 is _ secure _ if the key generated by the protocol between dealer @xmath3 and players @xmath5 is perfectly secure .",
    "note , that in order not to impose potentially impossible restrictions on @xmath5 s measurements , in these schemes a set @xmath5 is treated as one party , hence security is not guaranteed against cheaters within the set @xmath5 .",
    "we expect such cheats can be overcome for all graph state schemes , but leave it to further work . as with all qkd schemes , an authenticated classical channel between @xmath3 and @xmath5 is required .",
    "security will be shown against general attacks in a way which tolerates noise , as shown for a qudit extension of the ekert protocol in @xcite .",
    "previously security was only shown against intercept resend attacks @xcite ( although to some extent cheating players within @xmath5 could be tolerated ) .",
    "we now explore the relationship between the existence of protocols for rcq and qq as described above .    for the qq and rcq schemes defined as above from a channel state @xmath71 , with logical basis @xmath20 , the following relationships hold .",
    "[ prop 123 ] + 1 .",
    "a qq authorised set , is a rcq authorised set .",
    "a qq unauthorised set is a rcq unauthorised set .",
    "a rcq authorised set is a qq authorised set .",
    "proof : @xmath72 and @xmath73 are clear since the access of the classical information is a special case of the quantum information .",
    "we directly deduce @xmath74 from the lemma @xmath72 of @xcite , which says that @xmath75    if a set @xmath5 can access in the rcq protocol , after going through the associated quantum channel @xmath53 , the classical information is accessible in at least two mutual unbiased bases @xmath76 and",
    "@xmath77 , this means that @xmath78 , hence @xmath79",
    "moreover from its definition we have @xmath80 .",
    "hence @xmath81 , which means that the information is quantumly accessible .",
    "@xmath82    we note that it is not true that a rcq unauthorised set is automatically qq unauthorised , for example the @xmath13 rcq threshold schemes @xcite are only @xmath83 .",
    "however , as we will see additional mixing can address this and further , for pure state qq the unauthorised sets exactly determined by the authorised sets , so that the connection between qq and rcq is exact .",
    "we will now show that a valid access structure for a rcq protocol implies a secure key distribution .",
    "a rcq authorised set is a rcq secure set .",
    "proof : from proposition [ prop 123].3 a rcq authorised set is qq authorised , hence there exists a decoding map @xmath39 .",
    "then we notice that the action of @xmath39 takes the channel state to a maximally entangled state between @xmath3 and @xmath42 . to guarantee security",
    "we can define the measurements @xmath47 as first @xmath5 does @xmath39 , then measures @xmath84 for @xmath29 or @xmath85 if @xmath31 . for security",
    ", one can consider the step @xmath39 simply as part of the channel distributing the entangled state .",
    "the remaining part of the measurements coincide exactly with those in the extended six state protocol in @xcite , hence security follows directly from there .",
    "note that the same connection holds if only two measurement settings were chosen , so in both directions two settings are sufficient to show equivalence . however , more settings can allow for better noise tolerance @xcite .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : rcq ] . also , these measurements may not be the only ones allowing for a secure protocol .",
    "indeed , the measurements in the rcq schemes of @xcite are local , and not of the form here , yet , the statistics can be shown to be equivalent and security is still guaranteed .",
    "we summarize these results in the table [ table ] .",
    "[ table ]    .relationships between rcq and qq protocols ( proposition 1 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from these results we can immediately see that the schemes presented in @xcite allowing for all qq access structures can be used to give new rcq protocols allowing for all access structures . furthermore this can be done using high dimensional graph states @xcite .",
    "we note again at this point that the equivalence presented here does not include all possible schemes for sharing classical secrets .",
    "this is clear since the equivalence presented also implies access structures violating no - cloning can not work for rcq schemes .",
    "in particular the use of qkd plus shamir schemes does not prohibit access structures with more than one accessing set .",
    "hence such schemes can not be connected in a simple way to qq schemes .",
    "indeed this fact ( as well as their possible intrinsic interest discussed at the end of this paper ) , is why we concentrate on rcq schemes , so that we may make general , yet interesting statements of equivalence .    at this point",
    "we return to the question of dimensionality .",
    "in fact , with a small modification to considering the rcq protocol for only two bases ( the @xmath86 and @xmath31 bases ) , propositions 1 and 2 work for all composite dimension also .",
    "this follows from the proofs and the fact that the security in @xcite , and lemma ( [ bb ] ) , works for any dimension by restricting to these two bases .",
    "we now clarify the relationship between qq , rcq and quantum error correcting codes ( qecc ) .",
    "a qecc encodes a space of dimension @xmath87 onto @xmath1 systems ( or shares ) , such that errors on some subsets of systems can be tolerated .",
    "a distance @xmath3 means that the code can tolerate the loss of @xmath88 shares ( systems ) , or @xmath89 arbitrary errors at unknown locations . for shares of dimension @xmath0 we denote a qecc as @xmath90 .",
    "clearly one can use such an encoding as a qq , and in the language of ramp schemes , if each share is a player , this means that @xmath91 . which players are unauthorised is apriori not given for a code and must be checked ( see e.g. @xcite .",
    "similarly it is clear that any qq scheme is a qecc with @xmath92 .",
    "it was noticed in @xcite that for the case of error correcting protocols encoding onto pure states , the situation becomes much simpler .",
    "it turns out that in this case it can be seen that the tolerance of a code to the loss of a set of shares @xmath93 is exactly equivalent to the same set @xmath93 not getting any information whatsoever about the encoded information .",
    "when used for qq this means its ramp scheme parameter is @xmath94 . but by no cloning @xmath95 .",
    "thus for all qq with pure state encodings @xmath96 . for threshold schemes this reduces to @xmath97 as was explicitly stated in @xcite ( see also @xcite for linear codes and @xcite for uses and applications to non - threshold schemes for qubits ) .",
    "furthermore , it gives a general relationship : a pure state qecc protocol @xmath90 is equivalent to a qq ramp scheme where all shares are considered as players with parameters @xmath98 .",
    "that is all such qecc are qq ramp schemes with those parameters , and vice versa .",
    "we can then ask what else is imposed by the relationship with error correction .",
    "one important question is that of share size .",
    "it can easily be seen that the singleton bound implies that for ( perfect ) threshold schemes with pure state encoding @xmath99 .",
    "hence , when @xmath87 is a power of @xmath0 , ( as is the case for many codes , including all stabiliser codes ) , the only non trivial encoding satisfies @xmath100 and all pure state ( perfect and ideal ) threshold schemes must be mds codes ( of dimension @xmath72 ) ( see also @xcite for a rigourous information theorical based proof in both directions ) .",
    "this implies something that has been shown for small @xmath1 cases in @xcite , which is that , for all pure state perfect threshold qq secret sharing schemes encoding a secret equal to the size of each share ( that is ideal schemes ) , the dimension of each share must scale with @xmath1 , @xmath101 this bound , as explained in @xcite , follows from the fact that the code saturates the quantum singleton bound .",
    "moreover , the quantum mds conjecture for such codes , also cited in @xcite , states that it would scale as badly as @xmath102 .",
    "this result extends the bounded maximal length given by theorem @xmath103 of @xcite to qudit systems .",
    "we note that the above results need only hold for pure state error correcting codes .",
    "the general schemes in this work have used pure state encoding . however , as mentioned earlier , mixed states encodings can also exist , though they will have purifications which can be phrased in our framework ( hence in some sense they are also covered ) .",
    "it is interesting to consider what exactly our results mean for the mixed state schemes .",
    "the first thing that we can say is that the relationships between qq and rcq will still hold in the mixed case .",
    "we have to be a bit careful by what we mean , but if we define both protocols in terms of the map @xmath39 from the original secret state @xmath104 held by the dealer to the encoded version held by set of players @xmath5 ( whereby qq is a direct use of @xmath39 and rcq is equivalent to the dealer sending half a maximally entangled state through @xmath39 then doing the measurements ) and take the information theoretic definitions of authorised , unauthorised and secure given in section [ sec : access ] , the proofs for equivalence in section [ sec : equivalence ] follow through directly .",
    "on the other hand , there do of course exist mixed state schemes which do not satisfy the error correction restrictions for pure state schemes above .",
    "indeed , as pointed out in @xcite , it is possible to go from @xmath105 to @xmath106 threshold schemes by throwing away @xmath107 systems . clearly these mixed schemes to not satisfy @xmath96 .",
    "such schemes were used in @xcite to show that all qq threshold schemes can be achieved using quantum reed solomon codes .",
    "it is these schemes which when translated to rcq schemes ( through our general relationship above ) show all threshold ( not violating no cloning ) schemes are possible for rcq also .",
    "note also that this approach of discarding shares clearly holds in the rcq extensions presented in this work , hence a qq @xmath4 mixed state scheme implies a rcq @xmath4 mixed state scheme .",
    "another set of schemes has been developed recently which do not satisfy the dimension restriction ( [ eqn : q bound ] ) @xcite .",
    "the idea of these schemes is to take pure state error correcting schemes , which are necessarily @xmath98 ramp schemes , thus guaranteed quantum access to at least @xmath8 , and add classical mixing on top to increase @xmath9 arbitrarily ( where classical information is distributed via classical secret sharing protocols over secure channels ) .",
    "since the original quantum codes are no longer threshold schemes , they do not have to saturate the singleton bound , and hence do not have to satisfy ( [ eqn : q bound ] ) .",
    "however , even in this case it seems there are some restrictions on share size @xcite .",
    "note also that both these sets of schemes can be purified , and their purifications clearly fall into our generalized schemes and must satisfy the above still , and although such purifications are impractical , this fact imposes restrictions on the mixed protocols also .",
    "on the one hand , the error correction codes which were used to provide arbitrary access structures for qq @xcite , can , through the generalised scheme presented here , be used for rcq , hence all access structures ( not contracting the no cloning theorem ) become possible .",
    "in addition we have seen that the mapping from qq to rcq allows for standard qkd security proofs to be used , implying full security within the authorised sets ( where previously it was only known for limited attacks ) .    as was remarked in the introduction ,",
    "applying simple qkd plus existing classical secret sharing schemes solves the same problem of an untrusted channel between the dealer and players as does rcq .",
    "nevertheless , we believe it interesting to study the existence of rcq protocols in their own right - aside from the usefulness as a theoretical tool through the connection to qq and qecc , they may be used as building blocks for more involved protocols .",
    "for example one may imagine using the redundancy of information present in rcq in order to realise a more noise tolerant bipartite qkd - all the shares belong to one player bob - so that bob recover the information in the presence of noise ( including erasure ) , i.e. a kind of quantum error corrected qkd .",
    "one may also imagine using rcq as a means to authenticate a quantum channel using an authenticated classical channel - the only way that the correlations shared at the end of the rcq protocol ( that is , correlated measurement results ) , between the dealer and authorised set @xmath5 , can be correct ( i.e. close to equal ) is if the quantum channel is close to perfect between the dealer and @xmath5 ( indeed this is the essence behind the link to qq ) .",
    "this could be used in combination with qq as a way to test the channel and then use it for qq for example . in this setting having both schemes using the same resources as presented here would make such combinations more practical in terms of both implementation and how they could be used together .    in the other direction ,",
    "these results give a method for searching for error correcting codes starting from rcq schemes .",
    "checking the access structure ( or error correcting capability ) for rcq can be more straightforward than checking the qq case .",
    "we have seen that checking the access structure for only two bases suffices , for any dimensional system , to guarantee access ( tolerance to loss ) for quantum information too . in particular for graph state schemes",
    ", many tools have recently been developed to phrase the conditions for secret sharing in solely graphical language , which have been used to search for new schemes @xcite which are therefore valid qq and qecc schemes , and put bounds on the parameters that can be achieved . through the general connection shown in this work , such techniques",
    "can also be used to search for quantum error correcting codes , in particular for higher dimensional codes which are seen to be necessary for the most efficient codes and general access structures .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge discussions on the topics of this research with simon perdrix , gilles zemor and thank vlad gheorghiu for comments .",
    "we particularly thank francesco buscemi for discussions and pointing out reference @xcite and anthony leverrier for explaining security proofs .",

    "<S> we will develop this connection to show equivalence of schemes , which will lead to new rcq schemes , tighter security of rcq schemes , and bounds on what qq schemes are possible , as well as providing a different approach to searching for error correcting codes .    in this work we present the most general qq secret sharing scheme for sharing a quantum secret and its extension to a rcq scheme , which formally encompass all quantum existing secret sharing schemes . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the existence of such a qq implies the extension to rcq case has the same access structure , and similarly , if there exists a rcq scheme of this type , the quantum version is also a valid qq secret sharing scheme ( propositions 1 and 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to use the qq schemes from @xcite for the extended rcq scheme , allowing all access structures ( not violating the no cloning theorem ) . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalence further allows for security amongst authorised sets for the rcq scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we then clarify the equivalence between the secret sharing protocols and quantum error correction , showing that all ramp schemes are error correcting schemes and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> several restrictions are thus imposed from the theory of error correction , notably , that for pure state qq threshold schemes , the size of the share must scale with the size of the network ( something which is also true in the fully classical setting ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we start in the next section by describing the protocols . </S>",
    "<S> then in section [ sec : access ] we give precise definitions of the requirements of authorised and unauthorised sets in terms of the information that can obtain . in section [ sec : equivalence ] we show how the qq and rcq schemes are related to each other , summarized in table i. then in section [ sec : qecc ] we elaborate on the relationship with error correction and finish with discussions in section [ sec : discussion ] . </S>"
