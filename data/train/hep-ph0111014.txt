    "cdf has recently presented results on the production of combinations involving at least one photon and one lepton ( @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) in @xmath7 collisions at @xmath8 , using 86 pb@xmath9 of tevatron 1994 - 95 data @xcite . in general the results",
    "were consistent with the standard model ( sm ) , however 16 photon - lepton events with large @xmath2 were observed , with @xmath10 expected .",
    "moreover , 11 of these events involved muons ( with 4.2 @xmath11 0.5 expected ) and only 5 electrons ( with 3.4 @xmath11 0.3 expected ) , suggestive of a lepton flavour violating asymmetry involving muons .    what can such a process be ?",
    "a natural framework with explicit flavour violating couplings is provided by r - violating supersymmetry @xcite , which contains operators with a complicated flavour structure in the superpotential w_rpv=_ijk l_il_j|e_k+_ijkl_iq_j|d_k+ ",
    "_ ijk|u_i|d_j|d_k+_i l_i h_2 [ eq : superpot ] where @xmath12 @xmath13 are the left - handed lepton ( quark ) superfields while @xmath14 and @xmath15 contain the corresponding right - handed fields , and @xmath16 generation indices .",
    "the second of the above terms is of particular interest , since it can lead to resonant slepton production in hadron - hadron collisions @xcite , via the diagram that appears below .",
    "( 200,70 ) ( 30,5)(60,25 ) ( 60,25)(30,45 ) ( 60,25)(90,25)3 ( 90,25)(120,5 ) ( 90,25)(120,45)3 ( 120,45)(150,35)3 ( 120,45)(150,65)32 ( 32.5,2.5)@xmath17 ( 32.5,45)@xmath18 ( 122.5,5)@xmath6 ( 100,40)@xmath19 ( 75,32.5)@xmath20 ( 152.5,32.5)@xmath21 ( 152.5,62.5)@xmath22    such a resonance would lead to enhanced cross sections with a rich final state topology , which , as we are going to show , can explain the cdf anomaly . what would then be the structure of the associated operator ?",
    "r - violating couplings have upper bounds coming from various flavour - violating processes @xcite . therefore , to get the requisite number of events to explain the observed anomaly , a sizable cross section is required which would then imply a process with valence quarks in the initial state .",
    "since the events are seen in the muon channel , the operator can be specified to be @xmath23 , which generates the couplings @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( and charge conjugates ) , along with other supersymmetrised copies involving squarks .",
    "this coupling , @xmath4 , is constrained from @xmath26 @xcite to be @xmath27 @xcite .    upon production , sleptons ( in our case , smuons or sneutrinos )",
    "can in general decay via a large variety of channels @xcite if they are kinematically accessible . however , the crucial observation is that r - violating supersymmetry by itself may not account for the observed anomaly , because of the fact that the anomaly is observed in a channel where a photon is produced .",
    "however , if the gravitino ( present in all models where supersymmetry is gauged ) is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) it is too long - lived to decay within the detector @xcite .",
    "thus , the gravitino , @xmath21 , provides the missing energy signature since it is electrically neutral and interacts rather weakly with matter . if the neutralino , as is often the case , is dominantly photino , then the decay @xmath28 can dominate @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath29 event recorded by cdf  @xcite can be explained by such a decay  @xcite .",
    "since at the moment there is neither enhancement in the two - fermion final state , nor observation of chains of cascade decays , the most natural explanation is that the r - conserving decay mode of the smuon which produces the lightest neutralino dominates over the rest while subsequently @xmath30 .",
    "the competing r - parity violating decay modes of @xmath31 and @xmath32 leading to @xmath33 or @xmath34 final states become negligible ( as is the case here ) when @xmath4 and @xmath35 are both small enough .",
    "smuon decay into two jets via the r - parity violating mode is essentially unobservable because of the huge 2 jet background .",
    "for example , for a resonance mass of 200 gev , only a @xmath36 pb is excluded at 95% c.l .",
    "this will not provide a restrictive bound upon our scenario .",
    "it is worth stressing the clarity of the signatures , but also of future predictions in the case of a resonant process .",
    "moreover , the presence of both slepton and sneutrino resonances are in principle to be expected , and we provide a prediction for @xmath37 events . the higher statistics in run ii of the tevatron should allow verification our model .",
    "the new aspect of the model we present here compared to previous studies of resonant slepton production at hadron colliders  @xcite , is to marry the gravitino lsp scenario with r - parity violating supersymmetry .",
    "this marriage has been considered before in the context of dark matter  @xcite .",
    "we use the isasusy part of the isajet7.58 package  @xcite to generate the spectrum , branching ratios and decays of the sparticles . for an example of parameters , we choose ( in the notation used by ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath38 , @xmath39 ev , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and scan over the bino mass @xmath42 and the slepton mass @xmath43 gev .",
    "the values of @xmath4 and @xmath44 are dictated by the need to have the decays shown in fig .",
    "[ feynman ] being dominant .",
    "however , there are ranges of values in the @xmath45-violating coupling and the gravitino mass where this decay chain is obtained .",
    "in fact , the acceptable ranges are an order of magnitude in @xmath4 and two orders of magnitude in @xmath44 . @xmath6 together with other flavour diagonal soft supersymmetry breaking parameters are set to be so heavy that any superparticles except the first two generation sleptons , the lightest neutralino and the gravitino are too heavy to be produced or to contribute to cascade decays in tevatron data .",
    "they therefore do not appear in this analysis .",
    "we have checked that this is true over a large volume of parameter space .",
    "we emphasise that this is a representative hyperplane in the supersymmetric parameter space and not a special choice .",
    "we use herwig6.3  @xcite including parton showering ( but not including isolation cuts ) to calculate cross - sections for single slepton production .",
    "a @xmath22-in - active - region cut requires that the photon _ not _ have rapidity @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "the region @xmath48 is also excluded because it is not instrumented .",
    "fiducial photon detection efficiency was set to be 81@xmath49 , whereas for the muons it is 66@xmath49 for @xmath50 and 45@xmath49 for @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath2 and the @xmath1 of both the muon and photon were required to be greater than 25 gev .",
    "( 6,2.3 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 3,0 )    we calculate the difference in log likelihood between our model and the sm given by each kinematical variable that was presented in ref .",
    "this provides 95@xmath49 c.l .",
    "limits upon @xmath42 and @xmath52 .",
    "we show the viable regions for the energy distributions : @xmath53 , @xmath2 , the mass @xmath54 and transverse mass @xmath55 distributions @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and various transverse angular separations @xmath60 , where @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 , defined as the distance in @xmath63 space between the muon and the photon , is also used .",
    "it is not possible to take correlations between these different kinematical variables into account because we do not possess the multi - dimensional data .",
    "therefore we resort to examining each one in turn and see to what extent each region overlaps .",
    "[ scans ] shows that all of the 95@xmath49 confidence level regions overlap at @xmath64 gev , @xmath65 gev , indicating that our model is in good agreement with all of the observed kinematical properties of the events .",
    "the region at the bottom the plots is ruled out by lep2 from neutralino pair production  @xcite .",
    "the most discriminating kinematical variable is @xmath66 , which favors our model over the sm at the 3.3@xmath67 level at the best fit point @xmath68 gev and @xmath69 gev .",
    "we refer to this point as `` the best fit point '' from now on , and examine its properties more closely .",

    "we have displayed the relevant sparticle masses .",
    "all other sparticles are heavier than 1900 gev , and thus do not interfere with our analysis . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the corrected cross - section of 0.091 pb corresponds to 7.8 events additional to the 4.2@xmath71 predicted by the sm for 86 pb@xmath9 of luminosity , adequately fitting the excess of events quoted by cdf at run i.    we now determine the rate of single sneutrino production at run i. the process is : @xmath72 followed by @xmath30 .",
    "this would appear to mimic @xmath73 production , where @xmath74 . to compute the cross - section for this process",
    ", we use the cuts used by the d0 experiment in their @xmath37 analysis @xcite . with their cuts",
    ", we predict a supersymmetric cross - section of @xmath75 pb for the @xmath76 process at the run i energy , which corresponds to about 0.7 events for the 14 pb@xmath9 data analyzed by the d0 experiment .",
    "the d0 experiment observed 4 events over a sm background of 1.8@xmath110.2 events but with a much bigger background coming from cosmic ray sources which is estimated to be 5.8@xmath111.0 .",
    "as far as we are aware , the analysis has not yet been done with the full run i tevatron data but we would expect about 5.4 events for a 100 pb@xmath9 data sample .    we perform the above analyses for run ii ( at @xmath77 tev ) for the best fit point in order to make predictions for observable supersymmetric cross sections : @xmath78 which , ought to be observable with good statistics . since the numbers for the cuts and the efficiencies at run ii are not available , we have simply used those that the cdf experiment used in their @xmath79 analysis at run i. to that extent , these numbers are only indicative .",
    "for example , with an integrated luminosity of 2 fb@xmath80 , these cross - sections would correspond to  and  events , respectively .",
    "we predict 0.8 expected selectron pairs at run i. thus , the discrepancy with respect to the sm  @xcite from the observation of an @xmath81 event in the run i data is vastly ameliorated .",
    "r - parity conserving production processes such as these will be observable at run ii providing more independent checks upon our scenario .",
    "one expects an identical number of smuon pairs , leading to a @xmath82 final - state .",
    "this final state has not yet been observed by cdf , but we note that combining the @xmath81 and @xmath83 channels , our model still vastly ameliorates the discrepancy with respect to the sm .",
    "we have demonstrated that r - parity violating supersymmetry with a light gravitino can explain an anomalously high measured cross - section for the @xmath79 channel .",
    "we have provided possible tests for this hypothesis , in the form of susy cross - sections for the @xmath37 channel , and predictions for the cross - sections of both channels at run ii of the tevatron collider .",
    "the @xmath37 channel looks particularly promising because it will allow an independent check of our scenario .            for some of the earlier references ,",
