    "_ _ what is the structure of massive - star interiors and of compact stars ?",
    "_ how are cosmic isotopes created and distributed ? _ _ how does cosmic - ray acceleration work ? _ _ how is accretion linked with jets ? _ answering these questions will provide the basis to understand the larger astrophysical scales , like the interstellar medium evolution in galaxies , the supernova - fed gas in galaxy clusters , and the cosmic metallicity evolution .",
