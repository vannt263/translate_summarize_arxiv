    "we can also consider the small - mass limit @xmath4 under the condition @xmath282 , and the approximate expression of @xmath1 becomes @xmath283 which can remain positive by virtue of the existence of the logarithmic term @xmath284 .",
    "we evaluate numerically the integrals in the expression of @xmath1 , and the field - mass dependence is shown in fig .",
    "note that the maximum excitation of @xmath1 occurs at @xmath7 , and the peak amplitude denoted by @xmath285 is estimated to be @xmath286 .",
    "we can clearly see a resonance behavior of the polarization amplitude for massive fields with the compton wavelength @xmath28 of order of @xmath33 and also the tail part given by eq .",
    "( [ tail ] ) in the mass range of @xmath5 .",
    "we have studied vacuum polarization of quantized scalar fields in reissner - nordstrm background by means of the euclidean space green s function . in particular , the renormalized expression @xmath1 at the event horizon @xmath26 has been derived by revealing the contribution of the @xmath94 mode , which can cancel the logarithmic divergence .",
    "we have found the dependence of @xmath1 on field mass @xmath3 : ( 1 ) the tail part observed in the large - mass limit @xmath5 becomes equal to the dewitt - schwinger approximation .",
    "( 2 ) for small - mass fields a suppression of temperature - induced excitation due to the coupling between @xmath3 and @xmath13 occurs according to @xmath287 , where the massless part with the amplitude proportional to the black - hole temperature @xmath173 is given by @xmath288 .",
    "we can expect that mass - induced excitation becomes important for massive fields with @xmath289 .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to investigate in detail various aspects of the @xmath3-@xmath13 coupling in the case that both @xmath32 and @xmath131 are of order of unity .",
    "( 3 ) our main result therefore has been to show a resonance behavior of mass - induced excitation of vacuum polarization around nearly extreme reissner - nordstrm black holes with @xmath175 : if the compton wavelength @xmath28 of a massive field is of order of the black - hole radius @xmath33 , the amplitude of vacuum polarization has a peak at the resonance mass given by @xmath7 .",
    "there should be a critical temperature @xmath290 of black holes in the range @xmath291 , below which a resonance peak of @xmath1 is observed in the field - mass dependence .",
    "( if @xmath292 , the polarization amplitude monotoneously decreases with increase of @xmath3 . )",
    "though the value of @xmath293 remains uncertain within the analysis presented here , it is sure that dominant fields as quantum perturbations near the schwarzschild horizon should be massless , while nearly extreme holes will have a quantum atmosphere dominated by fields with a resonance mass .",
    "the peak amplitude given by @xmath294 at the nearly extreme reissner - nordstrm horizon is not so smaller than the massless part given by @xmath295 at the schwarzschild horizon with the same area @xmath2 .",
    "( if compared under the same black - hole mass @xmath20 , the former becomes slightly larger than the latter evaluated by @xmath296 . ) considering a black hole evolving toward the zero - temperature state with a fixed radius @xmath33 , we conclude that the mass @xmath3 of dominant fields generating vacuum polarization shifts from @xmath4 to @xmath297 as the contribution of mass - induced excitation becomes important , without changing the polarization amplitude so much .",
    "quantum back - reaction due to massive fields @xcite will become very important for nearly extreme ( low - temperature ) black holes .    the authors wish to thank y. nambu for helpful discussions .",
