    "achieving full control over the internal quantum states as well as the collision energy of the reaction partners to probe the detailed state - to - state dynamics and energy dependence of chemical processes has been one of the long - standing aspirations in gas - phase chemical studies . in the past",
    ", a range of experimental methods has been developed to address these objectives , e.g. , internal cooling of the reactants in supersonic expansions , experiments with crossed molecular beams at variable relative velocities and laser preparation of the reactants in specific quantum states ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and literature cited therein ) .",
    "very recently , new techniques have been established which allow the preparation of molecules at extremely low translational temperatures @xmath3  k and at the same time enable an unprecedented degree of control over their kinetic energy @xcite . in conjunction with the simultaneous preparation of the molecules in well - defined rotational - vibrational and even hyperfine states ,  cold molecules ",
    "methods are now starting to pave the way for studies of collisional processes and chemical reactions in new physical regimes and at levels of detail and sensitivity which have not been possible before @xcite .    whereas most efforts have so far concentrated on neutral molecules , techniques for cooling and controlling molecular ions",
    "have recently made impressive progress as well . from an experimental perspective , the sensitivity of the ion motion to weak stray electric fields in the apparatus renders the precise control of their kinetic energy difficult .",
    "this problem can be overcome by trapping the ions and cooling them sympathetically to millikelvin temperatures by the interaction with co - trapped laser - cooled atomic ions @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "the ions localize in space to form ordered structures usually referred to as `` coulomb crystals '' in which it is possible to observe , manipulate and address single ions @xcite .",
    "moreover , the preparation of molecular ions in well - defined quantum states is experimentally challenging and indeed only a handful of reaction studies with rotationally state - selected ions have been reported thus far ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "only very recently it has become possible to prepare coulomb - crystallized molecular ions in well - defined internal quantum states @xcite , so that a simultaneous control over the kinetic energies , positions and internal states of the ions can now be achieved .    in the present article ,",
    "we report the first study of a chemical reaction with rovibrationally state - selected coulomb - crystallized molecular ions .",
    "we investigate the prototypical symmetric charge - transfer ( ct ) reaction @xmath4 between state - prepared sympathetically - cooled n@xmath2 ions and internally cold n@xmath1 molecules from a supersonic expansion at a well - defined collision energy .    the mechanism and kinetics of this reaction",

    "this observation was rationalized in terms of a symmetric sharing of the charge between the two n@xmath1 moieties in the n@xmath5 reaction complex so that the probability for ct amounts to 50% upon its breakup .",
    "vibration - to - vibration ( v - v ) and vibration - to - translation ( v - t ) energy transfer occurring during ct have been investigated in this system both experimentally and theoretically , see refs . @xcite and references therein .",

    "the present work is the first to achieve rotational state selection of the reactant ions and rotational resolution in the analysis of the product - ion state populations allowing to gain insight into the dynamics of translation - to - rotation ( t - r ) energy transfer occurring during ct .",
    "the coulomb - crystal technology employed in the present study enabled us to monitor reactive collisions in small ensembles of 20 to 30 state - selected , spatially localized n@xmath2 ions with single - particle sensitivity .",

    "this result indicates that product ions over the whole range of rotationally excited states probed in the present study were generated as a consequence of ct between n@xmath2+n@xmath1 .",
    "because the neutral products leave the trap , no conclusions on their rotational - state distribution can be drawn .",
    "the observed redistribution of population in the ensemble of coulomb - crystallized n@xmath2 ions is the result of a sequence of ct reactions with neutral molecules from the beam .",

    "the ensemble of originally state - selected n@xmath2 ions in the coulomb crystal is lost and replaced with rotationally excited product ions .",
    "close inspection of the data in fig .",
    "[ pops ] reveals two important details .",
    "first , already in the beginning of the experiment when most of the reactive collisions occur with ions in @xmath50 , the generation of ions in all rotational levels probed in the present study can be observed .",
    "this observation suggests that the production of product ions is feasible over a broad range of rotational states by reactions with n@xmath2 in @xmath50 .",
    "the relevant rates appear to be of a similar magnitude , at least over the range of product states probed in the present study .",
    "second , for a specific rotational level @xmath14 , there appears to be a slight preference for the generation of the @xmath16 spin - rotational component in comparison to the @xmath55 component .",
    "the data were analyzed in terms of kinetic models taking into account ct collisions of the initially prepared n@xmath56 reactant ions as well as consecutive reactions of the product n@xmath2 ions , see fig .",
    "[ models ] .",
    "because the number density of neutral n@xmath1 in the molecular beam is much larger than the number density of the n@xmath2 ions in the trap , pseudo - first - order kinetics was assumed in both models .",
    "based on the observation that all product rotational states probed in the present study ( @xmath57 ) seem to be produced with similar rates , it was assumed in a first model that all processes of the form n@xmath58n@xmath59n@xmath60n@xmath61 ( bars indicate the rotational quantum numbers after the decay of the reaction complex ) occur with the same @xmath62 , see fig .",
    "[ models ] ( a ) .",
    "the complete loss of population from the manifold of states with @xmath63 was taken into account by an effective loss rate constant @xmath64 . in the absence of detailed information on the neutral product state distribution , @xmath62 and @xmath64",
    "represent effective rate constants averaged over all neutral product states .",
    "the spin - rotational level populations @xmath65 were obtained from the set of rate equations @xmath66 where @xmath67 represent degeneracy factors ( see fig .",
    "[ models ] ) .",
    "the initial state populations @xmath68 were also treated as a fit parameter , accounting for the uncertainty in determining the starting time of the measurement following the re - alignment of the molecular beam after ion loading ( see sec . [ expt ] ) .",
    "the fit of this model to the experimental data yielded the pseudo - first - order rate constants @xmath69  s@xmath8 and @xmath70  s@xmath8 . because the density of neutral molecules in the molecular beam is not precisely known , it was not possible to obtain second - order rate constants from these results .",
    "previous rate measurements with thermal samples of n@xmath1 gas leaked into the chamber @xcite were consistent with the result obtained by frost et al .",
    "@xcite that the total ct rate amounts to one half of the langevin collision rate @xmath71  @xmath7  s@xmath8 .",
    "the time - dependent populations of the @xmath72 states computed with the kinetic model using the fitted parameters are shown in fig .",
    "the agreement between calculated and experimental level populations is satisfactory given the spread of the measured level populations .",
    "the agreement vindicates the assumption that the state - specific rate constants do not ( or only weakly ) depend on the rotational state of the product ion within the uncertainty limits of the present measurement and the range of states studied .",
    "the kinetic model also reproduces the preferential generation of ions in the @xmath16 compared to the @xmath55 spin - rotational components of the same @xmath14 state suggesting that this effect is caused by the higher statistical weight of the @xmath16 components .    to check the validity of this model , its main simplification , i.e. , the restriction to a ",
    "universal  state - to - state rate constant @xmath62 , was relaxed . in a second kinetic model",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ models ] ( b ) ) , different rate constants @xmath73 and @xmath74 for reactions connecting states with different and like spin - rotational labels @xmath75 , respectively , were assumed to account for the preferential production of product ions in the @xmath16 levels . the fit yielded rate coefficients @xmath76  s@xmath77  s@xmath8 and @xmath78  s@xmath8 .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath73 and @xmath74 agree with each other and with the value of @xmath62 within the uncertainty limits , supporting the conclusion that the increased production rates of ions in the @xmath16 levels is indeed solely caused by the higher statistical weights associated with these channels .",
    "quasi - classical trajectory calculations were performed to interpret the experimental findings and gain further insight into the energy - transfer mechanisms involved in the reaction .",
    "initial states for the trajectory calculations correspond to semi - classically quantized states of rotating morse oscillators @xcite . in the experiment",
    "the molecules are exclusively in their ground vibrational state ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the initial rotational angular momentum @xmath14 of n@xmath2 ions was set to zero as prepared in the experiment whereas that of n@xmath1 was randomly sampled according to the experimentally measured distribution ( see sect .",
    "[ expt ] ) .",
    "initial coordinates and momenta were generated by randomly sampling the phase - space distribution of the rotating morse - oscillators and the spatial orientation of each molecule was taken from a uniform distribution within @xmath80 steradian .",
    "the magnitude of the angular velocity for a given vibrational phase was set to the angular momentum calculated from @xmath81 and its direction was randomly sampled from a uniform distribution in the plane perpendicular to the axis of the molecule .",
    "impact parameters @xmath82 were between 0 and 15  @xmath83 in steps of 1  @xmath83 , and in steps of 0.2  @xmath83 between 12 and 13  @xmath83 where the opacity function drops to zero ( see below ) .",
    "the initial separation of the center of mass of the two molecules was 20  ( @xmath84 ) , for which the intermolecular interaction energy was less than @xmath85  ev . according to the langevin - gioumousis - stevenson ( lgs ) model of ion - molecule reactions the rate does not depend on the relative velocity of the partners @xcite .",
    "therefore , the relative velocity of the colliding molecules was set to the calculated beam flow rate ( 787 m / s ) without dispersion .    to validate the simulations , the probability of complex formation and the probability of ct",
    "were determined for a range of impact parameters @xmath82 based on 5001000 trajectories at each value ( see figure [ reac ] ) . according to our quasi - classical model",
    ", the probability for ct was found to be 50% ( within the statistical uncertainty ) up to impact parameters @xmath86 .",
    "the ct probability starts dropping slowly between 10 and 12 @xmath83 , and above 12  @xmath83 it decays steeply to zero around 13  @xmath83 .",
    "the probability of complex formation is 100% up to 9  @xmath83 and drops proportionally to the ct probability . once the complex is formed , the probability for ct is @xmath87% regardless of the impact parameter .",
    "this finding is expected based on symmetry arguments and considering that rapid charge - redistribution takes place before the complex decays .",
    "it is also in agreement with previous experimental results @xcite .    from the integrated opacity function",
    "an integral cross section for ct of @xmath88 was obtained .",
    "multiplication with the relative velocity ( 787 m  s@xmath8 ) yields @xmath89 @xmath7s@xmath8 for the second order rate coefficient for ct .",
    "this value compares favorably with previous experimental results of @xmath90 @xmath7  s@xmath8 , @xmath91 @xmath7  s@xmath8 and @xmath92 @xmath7  s@xmath8 obtained for the ct reaction between @xmath93n@xmath94 and @xmath95n@xmath96 @xcite .    the lifetime of the complex was determined as the time difference between the last and the first crossing of the surface separation radius @xmath97 ( see sect .",
    "[ theo_pes ] ) . as figure [ life ] suggests , the median lifetime of n@xmath5 is @xmath21 ps and does not or only slightly depends on @xmath82 .",
    "lifetimes up to 100 ps are found for 94% of the trajectories which qualitatively agree with previous estimates @xcite .",
    "the salient quantity which can be extracted from the trajectories to aid in the interpretation of the experimental results is the distribution of rotational angular momentum @xmath98 of the n@xmath2 products after complex formation and decay .",
    "figure [ jdist ] reports @xmath98 and suggests that for the majority ( 97% ) of cases @xmath99 . on energetic grounds , a total of 0.045  ev is available in collisional energy for the reactants , and the initial rotational quantum number of n@xmath1 can be as high as 3 ( corresponding to a rotational energy of @xmath100  ev ) , which implies @xmath101 .",
    "the n@xmath2 products are predominantly formed in excited rotational states , which supports the experimental findings of depletion of the n@xmath2 ground state population caused by reactive collisions with the molecules in the beam .",
    "note that the theoretical product state distribution can not be compared directly with the experimental findings reported in fig .",
    "[ pops ] , because the n@xmath2 ions probed in the experiment result from a sequence of ct reactions , whereas the simulations only reflect single collision events .    however , the trajectory calculations clearly reproduce the rotational excitation of the products observed in the experiment and reveal the mechanisms of the underlying t - r energy transfer occurring during ct .",
    "the reactant molecules approach each other in a random orientation and are accelerated towards the potential well of the linear reaction complex .",
    "the torque exerted while forcing the reactants towards a linear configuration excites a counter - rotation of the n@xmath1 moieties which results in highly excited bending and torsional vibrations of the complex .",
    "moreover , anharmonic couplings lead to a practically complete redistribution of the available energy over all vibrational degrees of freedom during the lifetime of the complex . upon its breakup , large - amplitude bending and torsional",
    "vibrations are converted into product rotations .",
    "representative trajectories , projected on the pes , are shown in fig .",
    "[ pes ] to illustrate this effect .",
    "close inspection of the trajectories reveals the likely presence of additional processes resulting in the rotational excitation of the products , including rotation - vibration coupling , back scattering and recrossing which all may contribute to the final state distribution . under the present experimental conditions , the orbital angular momentum of complex - forming collisions",
    "is computed to be @xmath102 which is available for conversion into rotational motion of the reaction complex .",
    "coriolis forces may lead to a coupling of the complex rotation to its internal motion , providing another mechanism for the transfer of angular momentum to the fragments .",
    "furthermore , the trajectories shown in fig .",
    "[ pes ] suggest that a wide range of scenarios is possible .",
    "they include direct mechanisms , illustrated by the blue trajectory , and can range to bound states with almost full redistribution ( randomization , i.e. ivr ) of the internal energy as shown for the orange trace .",
    "this is reminiscent of the situation recently encountered in the vibrationally induced photodissociation of sulfuric acid where all regimes from prompt reaction to complete ivr were found , depending on the amount of internal energy made available to the molecule @xcite .",
    "in the present study we have demonstrated for the first time ion - molecule reaction studies with state - selected coulomb - crystallized molecular ions using the symmetric ct reaction n@xmath2+n@xmath1 as an example . by rotational state selection of the reactant ions and their localization in space by sympathetic cooling in an ion trap , their internal and translational motions were completely controlled . by simultaneously cooling the neutral co - reactants to the lowest rotational states and collimating their kinetic - energy distribution in a supersonic molecular beam ,",
    "ion - molecule reactions were performed with an unprecedented degree of control over both the collision energy and internal states of the reaction partners .",
    "the analysis of the product - ion rotational state distribution yielded for the first time information on t - r energy transfer occurring during ct .",
    "the experimental results were analyzed and interpreted by making contact with quasi - classical trajectory simulations on a full - dimensional pes .",
    "the simulations reproduced the experimental findings and yielded important insights at an atomistic level into the mechanisms underlying t - r energy transfer .",

    "<S> state - selected coulomb - crystallized molecular ions were employed for the first time in ion - molecule reaction studies using the prototypical charge - transfer process @xmath0 as an example . by preparing the reactant ions in a well - defined rovibrational state and localizing them in space by sympathetic cooling to millikelvin temperatures in an ion trap , state- and energy - controlled reaction experiments with sensitivities on the level of single ions were performed . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results were interpreted with quasi - classical trajectory simulations on a six - dimensional potential - energy surface which provided detailed insight into translation - to - rotation energy transfer occurring during charge transfer between n@xmath1 and n@xmath2 .    </S>",
