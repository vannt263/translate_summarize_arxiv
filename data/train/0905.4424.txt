    "since the pioneering work of simkin ( 1974 ) , major advances in the measurement of stellar orbits in early - type galaxies have been made . the first quantities to be measured were the line - of - sight rotation velocity ( v@xmath3 ; which can be considered a measure of ordered motion within a galaxy ) and velocity dispersion ( @xmath4 ; a measure of the random motions ) . by combining these two measures with photometric ellipticity ( @xmath5 ) it was possible to probe the anisotropy of stellar orbits in galaxies ( binney 1978 ) .",
    "further progress was made in this field when , in the 1980s , bender ( 1988 ) showed that although the isophotal shapes of early - type galaxies were well described by ellipses , small variations from ellipticity could be used to categorise them as either ` boxy ' or ` discy ' , and that these variations relate directly to the stellar orbital isotropy .",
    "the combination of surface photometry and detailed kinematics were therefore demonstrated to provide significant insights into the global structure of galaxies .",
    "more recently , higher order moments of the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) have been measured ( e.g. bender 1990 ; rix & white 1992 ; gerhard 1993 ; van der marel & franx 1993 ) .",
    "these characterise deviations from a pure gaussian shape , e.g. skewed and symmetric deviations , denoted h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 respectively .",
    "such parameters can indicate kinematic substructures , such as embedded stellar discs .",
    "the development of integral field units ( ifus ) , such as the sauron instrument , have given new impetus to this field , as these provide 2-d maps of the losvd .",
    "this allows the definition and estimation of a number of important new parameters that can be averaged over the surface of a galaxy in a self - consistent way .",
    "perhaps the most important of these is the ` spin ' parameter ( @xmath6 ) which is a proxy for the projected angular momentum per unit mass .",
    "applied to the sauron galaxy sample of 48 early - type galaxies , it was used to show that a dichotomy exists between ` slow- ' and ` fast- ' rotators ( emsellem et al . 2007 ) .",
    "trends between photometric and kinematic axis ratios and position angles have also been shown to vary with @xmath6 ; with slow - rotators often exhibiting strong misalignments .",
    "these observations provide new clues to the formation mechanisms of these differing galaxy types ( krajnovi et al .",
    "2008 ; cappellari et al . 2007 ; thomas et al . 2007 ) .",
    "statler & smecker - hane ( 1999 ) used a different approach to building 2-d maps of the losvd in ngc  3379 . using long - slit spectroscopy along four position angles",
    ", they were able to reconstruct a model of the 2-d kinematics by making suitable interpolations between their observed axes . however , such studies are rare due to the large amount of telescope time required to observe multiple position angles out to large radii .    despite these advances ,",
    "most observations typically reach to less than one effective radius , with only a handful of studies extending this coverage up to 23 r@xmath7 ( but see saglia et al .",
    "1993 ; graham et al . 1998 ; mehlert et al .",
    "2000 ; proctor et al .",
    "2005 ; sanchez - blazquez et al . 2006 ; forestell & gebhardt 2008 ) .",
    "however , such outer regions potentially provide key information regarding the physical properties of galaxies .",
    "for example , radii within 1  r@xmath7 only sample 50% of the baryonic mass and @xmath2 10% of the angular momentum of an idealised galaxy with an r@xmath8 like light profile and a flat rotation profile .",
    "the situation is even worse when considering the distribution of total galaxy mass ( including dark matter ) .",
    "for instance , the simulations of dekel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) show that only @xmath25% of the total mass is contained within 1  r@xmath7 ( see also mamon & lokas 2005 ) .",
    "furthermore , the signatures of some formation mechanisms only become apparent at large galacto ",
    "( e.g. mcmillan , athanassoula & dehnen 2007 ; weil & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "a means to probe the kinematics in the outer regions of early - type galaxies , and hence include a significant fraction of a galaxies angular momentum and mass , is therefore highly desirable .",
    "in this paper we measure stellar losvds from deep multi - object spectroscopic observations and develop a new technique for their analysis .",
    "specifically , we measure rotation velocity , velocity dispersion and the gauss - hermite coefficients h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 , out to @xmath23 r@xmath7 in five nearby early - type galaxies . by extending the region studied to such radii we encompass more than 85% of the baryonic mass , 30% of the angular momentum and 15% of the total mass , a significant increase in the fractions so surveyed in galaxies . to achieve this we exploit the large aperture of the keck telescope , the high sensitivity of the deimos instrument at 8500  @xmath9 and the strong calcium triplet absorption features at these wavelengths .",
    "even with this configuration , exposures of @xmath2  2  hours are required for our analysis .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows : in section [ odr ] we outline the observations and data reductions , detailing the technique by which we extract the host galaxy spectra . in section",
    "[ anal ] we outline our new kinematic analysis technique .",
    "results are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "we discuss our findings in section [ discuss ] , and present our conclusions in section [ concs ] .",
    "the galaxies in our sample were selected with the intention of obtaining spectra of their globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "the galaxies are all nearby , early - types with moderately rich gc systems .",
    "the selection also had the requirement that recession velocities were such that the calcium triplet lines would not generally be adversely affected by strong sky lines .",
    "the main science goal was to obtain gc kinematics , and hence probe the mass profile of their host galaxy halos .",
    "initial results for ngc 1407 from the 2006 nov . run",
    "have recently been reported in romanowsky et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "the data used in this work are from three observing runs using deimos on the keck-2 telescope .",
    "the first observing run was carried out in 2006 nov . using the 1200  l / mm grating centered at @xmath27500  @xmath9 and a 1 arcsec slit .",
    "this allows coverage of the calcium triplet at 8498 , 8542 and 8662  @xmath9 at a resolution of @xmath21.5  @xmath9 .",
    "the second run was carried out in 2007 nov . and the third in 2008 april , both using the same instrument setup as the first run .",
    "seeing was @xmath20.5 to 0.8 arcsec on all nights .",
    "a total of five galaxies were observed ( ngc  821 , ngc  1400 , ngc  1407 , ngc  2768 and ngc  4494 ) .    between two and six independent masks",
    "were observed per galaxy and the 16 x 5 arcmin field - of - view allowed the observation of @xmath280 - 120 spectra in each mask .",
    "however , only @xmath220% of these were at radii from which the signal of the background host galaxy was sufficient for the extraction of spectra ( see table [ fits ] ) .",
    "[ thumbnails ] shows the positions of slits from which host galaxy spectra were extracted .",
    "we note that it was only possible to measure recession velocities in some of the outermost slits , i.e. velocity dispersion and higher order moments are not presented for some of the outermost positions ."
