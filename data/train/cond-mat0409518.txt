    "kinetic lattice - gas models are a valuable tool for the modeling of nucleation and growth of adsorbate layers.@xcite in electrochemical systems , due to the presence of solvents and counter ions , common models are often more severe simplifications compared to surface science in ultra - high vacuum .",
    "it is also more difficult to estimate model parameters from first principles.@xcite though such estimations might seem desirable , they are not mandatory , and simpler ones , for example by fits to experiments , may be used , at least as a start.@xcite in spite of these complications , successful applications of the method to electrochemical systems are encouraging  ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "in addition , taking a more fundamental point of view , such truly microscopic models  and the equivalent two - dimensional ising models  may be compared to prevalent theories of nucleation and growth like the kolmogorov ",
    "avrami ( kjma ) theory of phase transformations,@xcite thus enabling one to investigate the latter s validity and underlying assumptions.@xcite the validity of the kjma theory has been established not too far below the critical temperature over a wide range of magnetic fields ( corresponding to supersaturation in the lattice - gas language).@xcite however , only spin - flip ( adsorption / desorption ) moves have been included in the dynamics . in the present work ,",
    "we extend these numerical studies to the effects of lateral adsorbate diffusion to nearest - neighbor positions ( corresponding to spin - exchange moves in magnetic language ) .",
    "our work is also inspired by recent electrochemical pulse experiments on the dynamics of the processes that occur after lifting the @xmath0 reconstruction of the au(111 ) surface.@xcite in that study , during a short positive pulse of the electrode potential , the reconstruction is lifted immediately , and excess au atoms are released onto the then ( @xmath1 ) substrate , where they quickly nucleate and form islands .",
    "after the pulse , the surface slowly reconstructs again , consuming the excess ions . during this process",
    ", however , the adsorbate structure still undergoes post - deposition dynamics , where small islands tend to decay faster , and large islands gain in size before they eventually decay .",
    "however , we emphasize that the connection of our model to these experiments is only qualitative . as the source for the adsorbate ,",
    "we use ions from the solution , whose supersaturation can be pulsed .",
    "moreover , we neglect the geometry of the surface and the dynamics of the lifting and reconstruction process . also , the peak coverages in our simulations are much higher than in the experiment .",
    "we rather focus on the general characteristics of the growth and subsequent decay of submonolayer adsorbates with attractive interactions during and after a pulse of their supersaturation , and how these characteristics compare to the kjma theory .",
    "though we keep the model as simple as possible , nearest - neighbor diffusion is an essential characteristic of the experimental system and must be included in the dynamics of the model .",
    "we shall not repeat here the discussion of the theory of the decay of metastable phases ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) , but only give a brief summary . the kjma theory in its simplest form describes the decay of a metastable phase to an equilibrium phase , driven by a difference in free energy , from simple basic assumptions : negligibly small nuclei form at random and subsequently grow isotropically to larger droplets .",
    "an extended volume is defined as the sum of the volumes of all droplets , which grow and overlap freely , even upon collision .",
    "since the nucleation events are completely random , they can also occur in the already transformed volume .",
    "the true transformed volume is the space covered by at least one droplet . due to the randomness of the process",
    ", the relation between the extended volume fraction @xmath2 and the ( true ) transformed volume fraction @xmath3 can be shown to be  @xcite @xmath4 assuming a constant radial growth velocity @xmath5 and a constant nucleation rate @xmath6 ( corresponding to continuous nucleation ) , the extended volume is , in two dimensions , @xmath7 at time @xmath8 after the beginning of the phase transformation .",
    "continuous nucleation is often associated with homogeneous nucleation due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "another case , initial nucleation , where all the nuclei are present at the very beginning of the transformation , is often associated with heterogeneous nucleation at defects . in the case of continuous nucleation , thermal fluctuations that lead to the formation of small droplets obey metastable thermodynamics , and knowledge of the size dependence of the free energy  @xmath9 of compact small droplets",
    "is needed . in a mesoscopic description , which should hold sufficiently below the critical temperature ,",
    "this is obtained as a sum of a surface and a volume term . in two dimensions , this becomes @xmath10 for a cluster with effective radius @xmath11 and surface tension  @xmath12 along a primitive lattice vector at equilibrium ( whose zero - field ising analog is known exactly  @xcite ) . the difference in coverage @xmath13 between the two",
    "degenerate equilibrium phases corresponds to the difference of the spontaneous magnetization of the two degenerate phases at zero field in the ising model.@xcite the use of the zero - field values is believed to be justified , and a recent publication  @xcite supports the point of view that the surface tension is not strongly field dependent ( though that study addresses a lower temperature ) .",
    "conversely , the use of the macroscopic surface tension for microscopic structures is questionable , and more accurate expressions are a matter of research  @xcite and are sought in this paper as well .",
    "the free energy has a maximum at the critical droplet size ( volume ) @xmath14 .",
    "the existence of this maximum is the reason why the phase transformation is activated . on average , when smaller than @xmath14 ,",
    "the droplets tend to dissolve , and when greater than @xmath14 , they tend to grow .",
    "the critical droplet size is a statistical quantity and is less sharply defined the flatter the shape of the maximum of the free energy .",
    "the velocity and the ratio of nucleation and growth are influenced by lateral mass transport . in ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) and under the impact of a constant flux of the adsorbate ,",
    "desorption may often be neglected ( irreversible growth ) . in electrochemistry ( ec ) , where the control parameter is the electrochemical potential , quasi - equilibrium is established for the subcritical fluctuations , so that desorption has to be included in a model description ( reversible growth ) . as a consequence , in uhv ,",
    "surface diffusion is generally the only means of lateral mass transport , while in ec , it can as well occur through the solution by independent desorption and adsorption events at different locations . in surface science , it has long been established that diffusion introduces correlations between clusters , since it reduces the nucleation probability in the vicinity of existing islands.@xcite recent publications have addressed this violation of the basic assumptions of kjma kinetics.@xcite since the number of nucleation events is effectively _ diminished _ , phase transformation is slowed down .",
    "however , it has not been considered that the enhanced mass transport can _ increase _ the nucleation and growth rates , resulting in an acceleration of phase transformation .",
    "thus , truly microscopic model calculations are desirable , and we provide them in this paper .",
    "this microscopic approach distinguishes our work from most other studies that aim at generalizing the kjma theory .",

    "we describe the electrochemical deposition of ions onto a metal surface in terms of a square lattice - gas model with attractive nearest - neighbor interactions .",

    "we choose this dynamic for the sake of consistency with earlier work.@xcite other dynamics that are commonly used in studies of electrochemical adsorption , such as the one - step dynamic  @xcite and the transition dynamic algorithm  @xcite also contain a _ local _",
    "transition barrier and are commonly known as arrhenius dynamics . for further discussion and applications of such dynamics ,",
    "see , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "two kinds of elementary steps are considered : an adsorption / desorption step , which corresponds to a non - conserved order parameter , and a diffusion step to a nearest - neighbor position , which conserves the order parameter.@xcite a new configuration is chosen by randomly picking a lattice site and proposing a trial step : either , with probability @xmath33 , an adsorption / desorption step or , with probability @xmath34 , a diffusion step to a randomly chosen nearest - neighbor position .",
    "thus , the ratio of the diffusion attempt probability to the adsorption / desorption attempt probability equals @xmath35 .",
    "explicitly , we propose adsorption when we choose an empty site for an adsorption / desorption step , and desorption when we choose an occupied site  there is no second - layer growth . when we choose an empty site for a diffusion step , the initial configuration is maintained  vacancies do not diffuse . only after attempting an adsorption /",
    "desorption step is the simulation clock updated by one monte carlo step ( mcs ) ; hence , a higher diffusion rate @xmath35 does not slow down the time scale for adsorption / desorption , which is the physically relevant time scale for the phase transformation .",
    "after @xmath36 mcs , the simulation time thus has increased by one _ monte carlo step per site _  ( mcss ) .",
    "hence , one mcss means in our simulations one adsorption / desorption attempt per site .",
    "we start our simulations with an empty lattice , set the electrochemical potential to @xmath37 , and let the system relax toward the stable configuration .",

    "every calculation is the average over 100 independent simulation runs .",
    "one of our goals is the understanding of the electrochemical deposition and subsequent dissolution of metal adsorbates after short pulses of the electrode potential . to that end , in addition to the constant - potential simulations described in the previous paragraph , we perform potential - pulse simulations for values of @xmath35 from @xmath39 to @xmath40 starting from a metastable low - coverage configuration ( result of an equilibration at @xmath41 ) , set @xmath37 and wait until a certain coverage @xmath42 is reached .",
    "then , we switch back to @xmath41 , at which the adsorbate desorbs again , and let the system equilibrate .",
    "in this section ,",
    "we present the results of our model simulations for the constant - potential and the potential - pulse cases . snapshots of the adsorbate morphology at different time steps  ( fig .
