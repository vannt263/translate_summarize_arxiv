    "the unit quaternions form a group that is isomorphic to su(2 ) , and therefore they have the ideal mathematical structure to represent ( pure ) spin-1/2 quantum states , or qubits . but while a unit quaternion @xmath0 is effectively a point on a 3-sphere , a qubit @xmath1 is often represented as a point on a 2-sphere ( the bloch sphere ) . such dimensional reduction results from ignoring the global phase of the spinor @xmath2 , dropping to a projective hilbert space where @xmath2 and @xmath3 correspond to the same qubit @xmath1 ( in this case , a hopf fibration @xcite ) .",
    "this paper examines certain symmetries and natural operations ( evident on the full 3-sphere ) that have been obscured by this usual reduction ; after all , a 3-sphere has a different global geometry than does a circle mapped to every point of a 2-sphere .    despite widespread agreement",
    "that the su(2 ) symmetries of the 3-sphere are more applicable to qubits than are 2-sphere symmetries , the project of analyzing qubits on the full 3-sphere has been generally neglected .",
    "the likely reason is that such an analysis might imply that the global phase has some physical meaning , against conventional wisdom . to avoid this potential conclusion the global phase",
    "is typically removed at the outset .",
    "but the topological mismatch noted above means there is no continuous way to remove this phase from all points on the 3-sphere . this issue might be seen as a reason to at least temporarily retain the global phase when analyzing spin-1/2 states or equivalent two - level quantum systems .    as further motivation ,",
    "note that geometric ( berry ) phases @xcite are routinely measured in the laboratory , in seeming contradiction to the orthodox position that global phases are irrelevant .",
    "the typical response here is to deny that single - particle hilbert spaces are appropriate for measuring relative phases , but nevertheless such phases _ can _ be computed in a single - spinor framework ( see section 5.2 for further discussion ) .",
    "this paper takes the position that the predictions of quantum theory would be the same whether global phase is a meaningless gauge or an unknown hidden variable , and the latter possibility is enough to motivate this line of research .",
    "even if global phases are canonically meaningless , they still can be important to research that strives to extend and/or explicate quantum theory .",
    "several independent researchers have hit upon using the global phase as a natural hidden variable with a role in probability distributions @xcite , and having a richer single - qubit structure may be useful for ongoing efforts to explain quantum probabilities in terms of natural hidden variables @xcite . but for any such work it is important to look at the full 3-sphere , to avoid defining a hidden variable in terms of a globally ill - defined parameter .",
    "for those readers unconcerned with such foundational questions , one can still motivate the 3-sphere viewpoint where it is mathematically advantageous to represent and manipulate spinors in quaternionic form ( even if the global phase is eventually discarded ) .",
    "these applications are developed in the next two sections .",
    "section 2 defines a useable map between spinors and unit quaternions that conveniently provides a direct quaternion - to - bloch - sphere mapping . right- and left- quaternionic multiplications",
    "are shown to correspond to rotations on the bloch sphere , with particularly surprising results for left - multiplications .",
    "after developing dynamics in section 3 , one immediate application is a dramatic simplification of issues related to time - reversal .",
    "specifically , one can time - reverse an arbitrary spin-1/2 state via a simple left - multiplication , without either complex - conjugating the state vector or including such a conjugation as part of a time - reversal operator .",
    "this permits a straightforward , classical - style analysis of the time - symmetry of the schrdinger - pauli equation .",
    "section 4 looks at further ramifications motivated by this 3-sphere viewpoint .",
    "it is shown that a ( seemingly ) necessary symmetry - breaking in the schrdinger - pauli equation ( the sign of @xmath4 ) looks quite unnatural when framed in terms of quaternions .",
    "this broken symmetry is related to the choice of _ which _ hopf fibration one uses to reduce the 3-sphere to the quantum state space . in section 4.3 , restoring this symmetry motivates an alternative second - order dynamical equation , encoding standard dynamics but containing a richer hidden structure .",
    "the extra parameters naturally encode the choice of hopf fibration , avoiding the broken symmetry while maintaining a clear connection to ordinary quantum states .",
    "combined with the global phase , these new parameters comprise either a larger gauge symmetry or a natural space of hidden variables . section 5 then discusses and expands upon all of these results .    surveying the literature ,",
    "the closest analog to the analysis in section 2 concerns transformations of plane - wave electromagnetic signals , translated into four - dimensional euclidean space via an extended jones calculus .",
    "@xcite ( that approach used normalized real 4-vectors instead of unit quaternions , but this is not an essential difference . ) while it seems doubtful that the novel digital signaling applications motivated by that research might be applicable in a quantum context , it nevertheless demonstrates that a quaternionic viewpoint can yield new perspectives on a well - understood system .",
    "it has also been noted that the standard mathematics for spinors looks awkward when expressed in quaternionic form , most explicitly in work by adler @xcite . in this prior work , adler focuses on the complex inner product , and proposes a quaternionic replacement while leaving the dynamics unchanged .",
    "such a step has the effect of halving the state space , and motivates the field of quaternionic quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "but apart from the initial motivation , it should be noted that the present paper does not follow this path in any way . far from extending the traditional machinery of quantum mechanics into the domain of quaternionic inner products , this work simply explores the evident symmetries of the 3-sphere , and tries to preserve such symmetries while maintaining a map to standard spin-1/2 quantum states .",
    "it turns out that this goal can best be accomplished via a dramatically _ enlarged _ state space ; a one - to - many mapping from qubits to quaternions .",
    "a qubit can be represented by any point along the surface of the bloch sphere , with the north and south poles corresponding to the pure states @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "( qubits here are assumed to be pure ; a later discussion of mixed states will be framed in terms of distributions over pure states , never as points inside the bloch sphere . ) for a given point @xmath7 on the sphere ( in usual spherical coordinates ) , the corresponding qubit is defined by @xmath8 as noted above , the global phase is not encoded in a qubit , so @xmath1 and @xmath9 correspond to the same physical state .",
    "the distinction between a spinor and a qubit , as used in this paper , is that spinors distinguish between such global phases . here",
    "a spinor is defined as @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and imposed normalization @xmath12 .",
    "multiplying @xmath2 by @xmath13 results in a different spinor , albeit one that corresponds to the same qubit .",
    "it is crucial to note that there is not a globally - unique way to decompose @xmath2 into the three angles @xmath14 , where the first two represent the location of the qubit on the bloch sphere .",
    "for example , attempting @xmath15 results in a coordinate singularity for qubits on the z - axis , leading to many possible values of @xmath16 .",
    "this reflects the fact that @xmath2 naturally represents a point on a 3-sphere , and the global geometry of a 3-sphere is not simply a phased 2-sphere . and if @xmath16 can not be globally defined , it can not be neatly removed without consequences .",
    "this point is clearer when the spinor is rewritten as a quaternion .",
    "there are many ways to accomplish this , but an obvious choice is the invertible map @xmath17 defined by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "( a short primer on quaternions can be found in the appendix . ) explicitly , this map reads @xmath20=\\bm{q}=re(a)+\\bm{i}im(a)+\\bm{j}re(b)+\\bm{k}im(b).\\ ] ]    .",
    "the states can be ( left)-multiplied by a global phase term @xmath21 , so there are many spinors ( and quaternions ) at a given point on the sphere .",
    "for example , @xmath22 is also at @xmath5 , and @xmath23 is also at @xmath6.,width=377 ]    normalization is enforced by restricting @xmath0 to unit quaternions , @xmath24 . from this",
    "it should be evident that the space of all unit quaternions lies on a unit 3-sphere , and so , therefore , does the space of all normalized spinors .    the previous point concerning the ambiguity of @xmath16 can also be made clearer in a quaternionic context . under the map",
    "@xmath25 , the quaternionic version of ( [ eq:3phase ] ) is    @xmath26    from which it is evident that if @xmath27 , only the combination @xmath28 can be assigned a unique value . despite this ambiguity , ( [ eq : q3phase",
    "] ) can always be used to find the corresponding bloch sphere unit vector @xmath29 in spherical coordinates .",
    "but if @xmath0 is not already of the form in ( [ eq : q3phase ] ) , it would seem to be easier to find @xmath29 by inverting the map @xmath25 ( [ eq : qdef ] ) and using standard spinor analysis ( which involves discarding the global phase ) .    a more elegant method for finding the bloch sphere unit vector @xmath29 _ without _ passing through the spinor representation is to generate a unit pure quaternion @xmath30 ( with no real component ) and then map @xmath30 directly to @xmath29 in cartesian coordinates .",
    "assuming the map @xmath25 , this can be done via @xmath31\\equiv\\hat{\\bm{q}}_k\\hat{x}-\\hat{\\bm{q}}_j\\hat{y}+\\hat{\\bm{q}}_i\\hat{z}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath32 is the @xmath33-component of @xmath30 , _ etc .",
    "_ , and this last equation is easily invertible , @xmath34 $ ] , given the cartesian components of @xmath29 .",
    "the former equation ( [ eq : qhat ] ) , however , is not invertible ; inserting the form of @xmath0 from ( [ eq : q3phase ] ) into ( [ eq : qhat ] ) , one finds that the global phase @xmath16 always disappears exactly .    but",
    "despite the mathematical elimination of @xmath16 when mapping to the bloch sphere , this quaternionic perspective still permits a geometrical interpretation of the global phase .",
    "this is because eqn .",
    "( [ eq : qhat ] ) is known to represent a rotation @xmath35 on the 2-sphere of unit pure quaternions ( as further discussed in the appendix ) .",
    "the different global phases , then , apparently correspond to _ different _ rotations that will take @xmath33 to the same @xmath30 .",
    "these rotations can also be mapped on the bloch sphere itself .",
    "first , write @xmath0 in the most natural form of an arbitrary unit quaternion ; @xmath36 where @xmath37 is another unit _",
    "pure _ quaternion , and @xmath38 is an angle . to interpret ( [ eq : qhat ] ) as a rotation on the bloch sphere , simply map all of the pure quaternions to the bloch sphere using eqn ( [ eq : fdef ] ) ; @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath40 $ ] , @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "eqn ( [ eq : qhat ] ) then indicates that the bloch sphere vector @xmath29 can be found by rotating the vector @xmath42 by an angle @xmath43 around the axis @xmath44 . just as there",
    "many rotations that will take one vector into another , there are many quaternions that correspond to any given vector @xmath29 .",
    "this implies that the most natural reading of the spin-1/2 state in the form of the quaternion @xmath0 is not a mere vector on a 2-sphere , but rather as a _ rotation _ on a 2-sphere .",
    "this rotation can be _ used _ to generate a particular vector @xmath29 , but it also contains more information not available in @xmath29 , such as the angle @xmath38 .",
    "this angle is distinct from the global phase @xmath16 ( as the latter can not be precisely defined in a global manner ) .      for a spinor represented as a unit vector on the bloch sphere",
    ", a rotation of that vector by an angle @xmath45 around an arbitrary axis @xmath46 can be achieved by an operation of the complex matrix : @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is the usual vector of pauli matrices , defined in the appendix .",
    "there is a simple correspondence between @xmath49 and an exponential quaternion , due to the strict parallel between @xmath50 and the three imaginary quaternions @xmath51 .",
    "( see the appendix and table 1 for further details on this point . )",
    "assuming the map @xmath52\\!\\!=\\!\\!\\bm{q}$ ] defined above , a right multiplication by @xmath53 , @xmath54 , or @xmath55 on a unit quaternion @xmath0 rotates the corresponding bloch sphere vector @xmath29 by an angle @xmath45 around the positive @xmath56 , @xmath57 , or @xmath42 axes ( respectively ) .",
    "more generally , a right multiplication by @xmath58 effects a rotation of an angle @xmath45 around the arbitrary axis @xmath59 $ ] such that : @xmath60 = \\bm{q } e^ { -\\hat{\\bm{n } } \\frac{\\gamma}{2 } } .\\ ] ] this simple relationship can also be seen from eqn ( [ eq : qhat ] ) ; as @xmath61 , one finds @xmath62 .",
    "again , this is a rotation of @xmath30 on the 2-sphere of unit pure quaternions , which can be mapped to the bloch sphere via ( [ eq : fdef ] ) .    as every unit quaternion can be written in the form @xmath58 , and as we are only interested in transformations that keep @xmath0 normalized , there are no other right - multiplications to consider .",
    "table 1 lists some useful special rotations , corresponding to quantum gates ( assuming the use of the @xmath25 map from spinors to quaternions ) .",
    ".[tab1 ] some common single - qubit gates are presented in terms of a right - multiplied quaternion ( assuming the use of the map @xmath25 ) . for @xmath63-rotations ,",
    "the two possible directions yield a different sign outcome .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ , < \" , ]      from a quaternion - based viewpoint , one would expect no essential difference for left - multiplication as compared to right - multiplication ; given the above results , left - multiplication should merely encode another class of rotations .",
    "but right - multiplications have seemingly spanned the range of possible unitary operators , so a spinor - based perspective might find it surprising that there is another type of transformation at all .",
    "indeed , in some quaternion - based approaches to quantum spin @xcite , left - multiplications have simply been left undefined , despite the clear meaning of such operations in the quaternion algebra .",
    "the resolution of this apparent disagreement lies in the fact that left - multiplications map to non - unitary operators and/or global phase shifts .",
    "( this was recently detailed in an analysis of electromagnetic plane - waves , concerning these same left - isoclinic rotations in 4d euclidean signal space @xcite . )",
    "some left - multiplications correspond to anti - unitary operators , making this mathematics particularly useful for analysis of time - reversed spin-1/2 systems .",
    "the connection between quaternions and time - reversal of spin-1/2 states has been known for some time @xcite , but utilizing generic left - multiplications ( as opposed to simply a special time - reversal operator ) allows for a deeper analysis of the relevant symmetries .    except for a measure - zero set of ( unitary ) phase - change operators and ( anti - unitary ) time - reversal operators , most of the quaternionic left - multiplications correspond to operators that are merely non - unitary .",
    "a famous theorem by wigner @xcite indicates that such operators must take pure states into mixed states , and such operators have already found significant application in quantum information theory .",
    "here a new motivation presents itself , via the quaternion mathematics .",
    "given that there is no essential difference between quaternionic left- and right - multiplication , every symmetry evident in the right - multiplication sector should have an equally important symmetry in the left - multiplication sector .",
    "( recall the original motivation of this paper was to see if perhaps the bloch - sphere viewpoint had obscured particular features evident on the full 3-sphere . )    as before , we shall assume the map @xmath64\\!\\!=\\!\\!\\bm{q}$ ] , and enforce the continued normalization of @xmath0 by only multiplying exponential quaternions .",
    "using the notation @xmath65 , the simplest case is the left multiplication @xmath66 , which simply changes the global phase of @xmath0 .",
    "eqn ( [ eq : qhat ] ) indicates that this does not lead to any bloch sphere rotation , because @xmath67 .",
    "this same equation offers a geometrical interpretation of a general left - multiplication @xmath68 .",
    "recall that ( [ eq : qhat ] ) implies @xmath0 does not merely encode a bloch vector @xmath29 , but instead a _ rotation _ of the vector @xmath42 , with many different rotations ( @xmath0 s ) that can take @xmath42 to the same @xmath29 ( corresponding to different global phases ) .",
    "now , a left multiplication on @xmath0 can be viewed as two consecutive rotations ; @xmath69 in other words , @xmath68 serves to _ first _",
    "rotate @xmath70 $ ] , before the rotation encoded by @xmath0 can be executed . and",
    "as rotations do not commute , one can not calculate @xmath71 $ ] without knowing _ which particular rotation _",
    "@xmath0 encodes .",
    "different global phases of the original @xmath0 will therefore lead to a different final bloch vector @xmath72 , even if @xmath29 and @xmath68 are exactly known .",
    "such a transformation is neither unitary nor anti - unitary , but may be mathematically useful even if it is not physically possible .",
    "the two exceptions to this ambiguity are when the central term in ( [ eq : qprime ] ) is either @xmath33 or @xmath73 .",
    "the former case has been discussed above ; this is just a global phase shift .",
    "the latter case can be realized by a left multiplication of ( say ) @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",
    "the net effect of such a left - multiplication would be a simple minus sign ; @xmath76 , inverting the original bloch sphere vector .",
    "it follows that both @xmath77 and @xmath78 act like the anti - unitary time - reversal operator @xmath79 ( when used to left - multiply a quaternion ) .",
    "if one insists on thinking of @xmath0 as simply encoding a vector @xmath29 on the bloch sphere ( rather than as a rotation ) , it is still possible to interpret left - multiplications as a rotation of @xmath29 around a sometimes - unknown axis .",
    "a general left multiplication of @xmath0 by @xmath80 is equivalent to rotating the bloch sphere vector @xmath29 by an angle @xmath45 around some axis . but",
    "this rotation axis @xmath81 is no longer given by @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "indeed , @xmath81 is not even computable from knowledge of the vector @xmath29 ; it depends on the entirety of @xmath0 . still , if the global phase @xmath16 is completely unknown , instead of one particular rotation axis @xmath81 , there are instead many possible rotation axes , @xmath82 .",
    "these possible axes form a circle on the bloch sphere , and @xmath29 passes through the center of this circle .",
    "the result is that @xmath68 corresponds to a cone of possible rotation axes ( assuming the global phase is unknown ) .",
    "the angle of this cone can be determined from the relationship @xmath83 in other words , the angle between the @xmath84-axis and @xmath46 is the half - angle of the cone produced by the possible values of @xmath81 . in the special case",
    "that @xmath85 , this cone angle is zero . in this case , the only possible rotation axis for @xmath29 is @xmath29 itself , or no rotation at all ; this corresponds to a global phase change , with no state change .",
    "the other special case is when @xmath86 lies in the quaternionic @xmath87 plane , which means that @xmath46 lies in the @xmath88 plane of the bloch sphere .",
    "the angle between @xmath42 and @xmath46 is then always @xmath89 . in this case , the possible rotation axes @xmath82 form a great circle : the equator corresponding to a pole defined by @xmath29 . a @xmath90 rotation around _",
    "any _ of these axes will send @xmath91 , exactly reversing the direction of the bloch sphere vector , regardless of @xmath16 .",
    "( again , this corresponds to an anti - unitary operation , @xmath79 . ) in general , for the map @xmath64=\\bm{q}$ ] , this reversal is equivalent to any left - multiplication of the form @xmath92=e^{[\\bm{j } cos(\\delta ) + \\bm{k } sin(\\delta)]\\pi/2 } \\bm{q}\\ ] ] for any angle @xmath93 .",
    "one convenient left - multiplication of this form is at @xmath94 , or @xmath95 , which will be used as the time - reversed representation of @xmath0 in the next section .",
    "when it comes to the equations that describe the dynamics of a charged spin-1/2 state in a magnetic field , quaternions also provide a useful and simplifying framework . in a magnetic field @xmath96 ,",
    "the standard schrdinger - pauli equation for @xmath97 reads ( in spinor form ) @xmath98 here @xmath45 is the gyromagnetic ratio .    because of the correspondence between the three components of @xmath50 and the imaginary quaternions @xmath99 , this matrix algebra can be trivially encoded in the quaternionic version of the schrdinger - pauli equation , which simply reads @xmath100 here @xmath101 is a pure quaternion defined in terms of the three components of @xmath102 ; @xmath103    but these equations are unsatisfactory in that they only describe the geometric phase , and this is not measureable on its own ; only the combined dynamic plus geometric phase can be detected .",
    "an inclusion of even the simplest and most fundamental dynamical phase ( say , a constant - energy term @xmath104 , where the energy @xmath105 might include a rest mass ) dramatically changes these equations . indeed , in the limit @xmath106 , this would be the only surviving phase .",
    "inclusion of this simplest dynamic phase would appear as an extra term @xmath107 on the right side of ( [ eq : sspe ] ) .",
    "the corresponding quaternionic equation ( [ eq : qspe ] ) is @xmath108 crucially , while @xmath101 enters as a right - multiplication , a quaternionic @xmath33 enters as a left - multiplication .",
    "somehow , one particular pure quaternion @xmath109 has been singled out by the dynamics , over @xmath110 etc .",
    "the source of this asymmetry can be traced back to the original map @xmath25 , defined in section 2 ; other choices would have resulted in a different final term of ( [ eq : spe ] ) . to see this ,",
    "define a different map @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is any unit quaternion . under this alternate map ,",
    "one finds a new representation of the spin state @xmath113 , related to the old representation by @xmath114 ( or , equivalently , @xmath115 ) .",
    "using this in ( [ eq : spe ] ) , and left - multiplying by @xmath112 , results in @xmath116 here the unit quaternion @xmath117 is guaranteed to be pure .",
    "one can also consider alternate maps of the form @xmath118 , but as detailed in section 2.2 , this is merely a rotation of the entire coordinate system , and only changes the map @xmath119 between the pure quaternions and the bloch sphere ( [ eq : fdef ] ) .",
    "( also , it changes the inverse of this map , which shows up in @xmath101 via ( [ eq : bdef ] ) . ) the most general map , @xmath120 , then , defines both the coordinate system in which the bloch sphere is embedded and the pure quaternion @xmath117 in the dynamical equation ( [ eq : vspe ] ) .",
    "one example of the value of quaternionic equations can be found by examining the issue of time - reversal .",
    "applied to the standard ( [ eq : sspe ] ) , one finds a series of decisions requiring substantial care and expertise to get correct : does the non - unitary time - reversal operator @xmath79 apply to such differential equations , or merely to instantaneous states ? does the sign of @xmath4 change along with the sign of @xmath121 , or is conjugation itself a way of effecting @xmath122 ?",
    "are the pauli matrices all time - odd , or just the imaginary @xmath123 ? is energy time - odd or time - even ?",
    "this section argues that such questions become far more straightforward when applied to ( [ eq : spe ] ) , and might even provide fresh insights to curious fermionic features such as @xmath124 .    for the quaternionic equation , it turns out that one can use the same logic as time - reversal in classical physics ;",
    "no complex conjugations are required .",
    "namely , one first changes the sign of all the time - odd physical quantities , then changes the sign of @xmath125 in all of the differential equations , and finally looks to see if the transformed equation has the same form as the original equation .",
    "( if so , one has time - symmetric physical laws . ) in the case of ( [ eq : spe ] ) , the only time - odd quantities are the magnetic field @xmath101 and the angular momentum encoded by @xmath0 .",
    "importantly , classical energy is time - even ( recall , @xmath126 might represent a rest mass term , @xmath127 ) , and should not change sign under time reversal .",
    "section 2.3 showed that one can reverse the direction of any arbitrary spin direction encoded by @xmath0 via @xmath128 .",
    "if one also takes @xmath129 and changes the sign of the time - derivative on the left side of ( [ eq : spe ] ) , this equation becomes @xmath130 another left - multiplication by @xmath77 therefore restores the exact form of ( [ eq : spe ] ) , because @xmath131 .",
    "therefore the schrdinger - pauli equation is time - symmetric , in precisely the same sense as classical physics .    if one performs this time - reversal twice , and demands the same left - multiplication on @xmath0 for each time - reversal , one has ( say ) @xmath132 , matching the @xmath124 operation from ordinary quantum physics . but",
    "from a classical perspective , such an equation appears baffling ; surely if one performs two time - reversals on any given history @xmath133 , it should be a logical imperative that one recovers the original @xmath133 , not a phase - reversed version .",
    "a solution to this quantum - classical disconnect could plausibly lie in the ambiguity of exactly _ which _ quaternion should be used to implement time - reversal  or better yet , a removal of this ambiguity entirely .    looking at the more general ( [ eq : vspe ] ) , one obvious strategy would be to associate time - reversal directly with a change of the sign of @xmath117 , rather than any particular left - multiplication on @xmath0 .",
    "if such a step were meaningful , it would immediately solve the above problems ; two time - reversals would then end up back at the original solution , with no extra phase shift .",
    "unfortunately , at this point , such a step does not seem to be possible , as @xmath117 is only defined in terms of the choice of @xmath112 used in the map @xmath134 , and the ambiguity of how to choose @xmath112 remains .",
    "( one could equally well choose @xmath135 or @xmath136 to change the sign of @xmath117 . )",
    "but if one follows through the proposals in the next section , it is possible to extend the dynamics such that @xmath117 does indeed have independent physical meaning as a time - odd parameter , raising the possibility that @xmath124 could be reconciled with the classical meaning of time - reversal .      in section 3.1",
    ", we noted that use of the map @xmath25 singled out @xmath33 as a special quaternion , and a careful reader might have noticed that this was also the case throughout section 2 .",
    "the quaternion @xmath33 corresponds to the unit vector @xmath70 $ ] , which played several special roles . in section 2.1 , @xmath42 was the starting vector for the natural interpretation of @xmath0 as a rotation . in section 2.3 , the unit vector @xmath42 appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cone ] ) .",
    "note that it was a left multiplication of @xmath137 that changed the global phase , but any pure quaternion other than @xmath33 in the exponent led to a non - unitary transformation of @xmath0 .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize section 2 to work for any map @xmath138 between spinors and quaternions .",

    "the results of section 2 go through for the general map @xmath134 .",

    "if one treated the wavefunction as purely time - even ( or purely time - odd ) , the analysis normally applied to classical physics equations ( as described in the previous section ) would reveal a formal time - aysmmetry .",
    "this is because @xmath146 represents energy , a time - even quantity , and time - reversal would lead to a different equation , with different solutions @xmath147 : @xmath148    this issue has a well - known resolution ; if the wavefunction is also complex - conjugated along with sending @xmath122 ( or more - generally , @xmath149 ) , then this conjugated state @xmath150 will solve the original ( [ eq : sse ] ) .",
    "but even with this resolution , a broken symmetry remains ; what chooses the sign of @xmath4 in ( [ eq : sse ] ) , and why should such a choice be necessary in the first place ?",
    "almost everyone would agree that this choice is a mere convention , and that equivalent physical predictions would have results if schrdinger had picked the opposite sign for @xmath4 in his original equation .",
    "but the fact that such a choice was necessary in the first place is an indication of a broken symmetry .    avoiding",
    "this choice is possible , but only by going to the second - order ( klein - gordon ) equation ; @xmath151 with the general solution @xmath152 .",
    "( here @xmath147 and @xmath153 are not related to each other , giving @xmath154 twice as many free parameters as either @xmath147 or @xmath153 alone . ) but despite the symmetries and relativity - friendly nature of this equation , it yields solutions with no obvious single - particle interpretation  in particular , solutions for which @xmath155 and @xmath156 are both non - zero .",
    "( for another perspective , see @xcite . )",
    "if such solutions are rejected as unphysical , that forces one to reduce the relevant equation down to either ( [ eq : sse ] ) or ( [ eq : trse ] ) , and that choice would seem to be a _",
    "necessary _ broken symmetry .",
    "the arguments in the previous subsection do not properly go through for a spin-1/2 system , and this is most clearly seen from the perspective of quaternionic qubits . for simplicity , first consider the zero - field limit ( @xmath157 ) . eliminating this magnetic field term from ( [ eq : spe ] )",
    "one might seem to still have a ( quaternionic ) @xmath33 present , but as discussed above , this stems from the choice @xmath25 of how one maps the spinor to the quaternion @xmath158 . a more - general map @xmath134 yields ( [ eq : vspe ] ) , or in the zero - field case , @xmath159 as before",
    ", @xmath126 could represent a rest mass ( @xmath160 ) , and @xmath117 is an arbitrary pure unit quaternion .",
    "the usual link between the standard - form schrdinger equation ( [ eq : sse ] ) and the time - reversed schrdinger equation ( [ eq : trse ] ) carries over to the quaternions .",
    "specifically , replacing @xmath161 with @xmath162 is accomplished via the equivalent of time - reversing the spin - state , @xmath128 .",
    "but in this form it is clear that @xmath163 are not the only two options ; depending on the choice of map @xmath134 , @xmath117 could be _ any _ pure unit quaternion , spanning a smoothly - connected 2-sphere of possible values . far from being a clearly broken symmetry ( as is the disconnected @xmath164 sign on the complex @xmath4 ) , one might now ask whether this enlarged and connected symmetry must be broken at all .    given the above analysis",
    ", the symmetry _ must _ be broken , because one must choose _ some _ map @xmath134 to interpret @xmath0 and to define @xmath117 in ( [ eq : vspe ] ) and ( [ eq : vspe2 ] ) .",
    "the freedom of such a definition lies on a 2-sphere , and is larger than the usual u(1 ) phase freedom ; this is less surprising if one notices that there is also the same freedom when choosing a particular hopf fibration @xcite . also note that the generator of a transformation between different choices of @xmath117 is a left - multiplication , and is therefore nonunitary , as per section 2.3 . if a gauge is fixed ( for example ,",
    "setting @xmath161 by fiat ) , then one can ignore this symmetry in the space of left - multiplications and proceed as usual .",
    "however , the question remains whether this symmetry must be broken at all , especially as it is not merely choosing a sign convention for a complex @xmath4 .",
    "one can avoid breaking this symmetry without ever using a non - unitary transformation , so long as the particular value of @xmath117 has a physical meaning and does not appear in ( or change ) the form of the dynamical equations .",
    "as in the case of the klein - gordon equation , this goal can naturally be accomplished by extending ( [ eq : vspe2 ] ) to the second - order dynamical equations familiar from classical field theory ; @xmath165 in the case of the klein - gordon equation , this is thought to be unacceptable because the larger solution space contains solutions that do not reduce to those of the first - order equation .",
    "but for the special case of qubits , at least , this concern disappears .",
    "so long as one constrains @xmath0 to be a _ unit _ quaternion , every solution to this equation will also solve ( [ eq : vspe2 ] ) for some pure unit quaternion @xmath166 .",
    "@xcite ) will instead solve @xmath167 .",
    "but this caveat goes away for microscopically - varying magnetic fields ; all unit - quaternion solutions to ( [ eq : bkge ] ) will solve ( [ eq : vspe ] ) . ] the larger solution space does indeed have new free parameters , but those parameters are the unit quaternion @xmath112 that defines the map @xmath134 and also defines @xmath166 via ( [ eq : vdef ] ) .",
    "if all maps to the standard schrdinger - pauli dynamics are indistinguishable ( as implied by the above discussion ) , then @xmath112 is either a choice of gauge or a hidden parameter .",
    "this result is not specific to the zero - field case .",
    "adding back the magnetic field , the second - order version of ( [ eq : vspe ] ) can be found by taking a derivative and eliminating @xmath117 ; @xmath168 this looks a bit more cumbersome than the first - order ( [ eq : spe ] ) , but notably it also results from a simple real lagrangian density ( see ( [ eq:2ndl ] ) below ) , and yields solutions that exactly map onto the standard schrdinger - pauli equation .",
    "@xcite ( the unit quaternion condition can also be imposed via @xmath169 , and the unit quaternion @xmath112 encodes the new constants of the motion .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this second - order equation on a 4-component quaternion raises the question of whether this is an alternate path to dirac s extension of 2-spinors to 4-spinors .",
    "after all , a first - order differential equation on a 4-component complex spinor has solutions with 8 free real parameters , just like the solutions to ( [ eq : bkge ] ) .",
    "but at this level the only constraint on a dirac spinor is an overall normalization , leaving 7 available parameters ( 6 if one ignores the global phase ) . here ,",
    "apart from normalization at some reference time @xmath170 , the solution space is constrained by the additional normalization conditions @xmath171 and @xmath172 , reducing the solution space to 5 free real parameters , counting the phase . and every one of these solutions can be made to map back to the original spin-1/2 system ; there is no room for antimatter solutions , even in this expanded space .    of these five parameters",
    ", three can be made to correspond to @xmath173 .",
    "the remaining 2 parameters are encoded in @xmath174 , and are of course time - odd ; these can be made to correspond to @xmath117 , and they determine which map @xmath134 should be used to interpret @xmath175 .",
    "( there is also a time - odd ( dynamic ) phase term in @xmath112 , but this naturally combines with the time - even ( geometric ) phase term in @xmath176 to determine a single parameter that corresponds to the net global phase . )    the immediate result of this expanded dynamics is that @xmath117 now encodes the time - odd parameters , and its sign should be changed upon time - reversal .",
    "this not only further simplifies the time - reversal analysis of ( [ eq : vspe ] ) above , but provides a non - operator technique for time - reversal , such that two time - reversals always exactly cancel .",
    "further implications of this expanded dynamical equation ( [ eq : bkge ] ) will be discussed in section 5.3 .",
    "most of the results from the first three sections do not require or imply any new physics ; they simply follow from a reversible map @xmath64=\\bm{q}$ ] between spinors and quaternions",
    ". these results will be of the most interest to the widest audience ( even those not interested in foundations ) and they will be summarized here first . a discussion of the more speculative implications will follow .    in the traditional spinor representation",
    "there is a clear mathematical distinction between a state @xmath10 and a unitary operator that acts on this state as a 2x2 matrix @xmath177 .",
    "in addition , there are non - unitary operators that can not even be written in matrix form , such as the time - reversal operator @xmath79 .",
    "mapping spinors onto the unit quaternion @xmath178 reframes all of these distinctions , as both states and operators can now be written as unit quaternions .",
    "there are still more operators than states , because the most general linear transformation of @xmath0 requires both left- and right- multiplications , @xmath179 .",
    "still , it is notable that all unitary operators can be represented as a quaternion right - multiplication only ( @xmath180 ) , so long as one does not demand control over the global phase .",
    "( the most general unitary 2x2 matrix has four real parameters , and the unit quaternion @xmath181 has three ; the missing parameter can be traced to the global phase of @xmath182 . )    since all 2x2 unitary operators @xmath177 correspond to a rotation on the bloch sphere , all quaternionic right multiplications also correspond to such a rotation .",
    "specifically , right - multiplying by @xmath183 is a rotation around the @xmath46 axis by an angle @xmath45 , where @xmath59 $ ] as given by ( [ eq : fdef ] ) .    furthermore , couched in the language of quaternions , the state itself is effectively just another unitary operator .",
    "in particular , the state @xmath184 is perhaps most naturally interpreted as a _ rotation _ rather than a vector , a rotation that takes the z - axis ( @xmath42 ) to the state s standard vector representation on the bloch sphere ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "there are many such rotations that will result in any given state vector , exactly corresponding to the many possible global phases of @xmath0 .",
    "the global phase can be shifted by a quaternionic _ left _ multiplication , @xmath185 .",
    "other left multiplications by unit quaternions @xmath68 correspond to non - unitary operators .",
    "in particular , any left - multiplication of the form shown in ( [ eq : tdef ] ) corresponds to the anti - unitary time - reversal operator @xmath79 .",
    "other non - unitary operators ( which have found use in quantum information theory ) are guaranteed not to change the normalization of @xmath0 so long as @xmath68 is also a unit quaternion .",
    "such operators take pure states to mixed states , because that the resulting state vector is as ill - defined / unknown as the global phase of @xmath0 .",
    "besides simplifying the dynamic equations of a spin state in a magnetic field , the ability to implement anti - unitary transformations via left - multiplication offers a view of time - reversal compatible with a classical perspective .",
    "specifically , it becomes far more straightforward to reverse all of the time - odd parameters in the dynamical equations , making the time - symmetry more clearly evident .",
    "although there are many ways to implement time - reversal via a left - multiplication , all of them conform to the usual @xmath124 if the _ same _ left - multiplication is applied twice .",
    "the results summarized in section 5.1 hold whether or not global phase is a mere gauge , but the status of global phase is important for the results discussed below .",
    "therefore , a short discussion of this topic seems appropriate here .",
    "the global phase of a single - particle quantum state is either a choice of gauge or an unknown hidden variable .",
    "although most physicists have come down in favor of the former option , there is no experimental evidence either way .",
    "indeed , we can not even probe down to the compton scale at which these phases would fluctuate .",
    "( for an electron , this phase frequency is @xmath186 , and @xmath187 is several orders of magntitude shorter than the shortest laser pulses . )",
    "it is rare to even see this @xmath188 oscillation explicitly in quantum equations , because it is typically removed _ on the assumption _ that global phases are irrelevant .",
    "of course , photons have lower - frequency oscillations than electrons , but this point only sheds further doubt on the notion that this phase is mere gauge . in the classical limit , the global phase of an electromagnetic wave is indeed meaningful , and in the quantum limit phase issues are necessarily addressed via quantum field theory .",
    "the failure of quantum - mechanical states to fully describe photons is arguably an indication that phases are a bit more important than quantum mechanics would have us believe .",
    "finally , note that even in the absence of a measurement on the time - scale of an oscillation , another way to probe oscillations is via a reference oscillator . and",
    "of course , there is an enormous body of experimental evidence that such relative phases are indeed meaningful . one simple explanation for this fact would be that single - particle states have a meaningful global phase , and such experiments are measuring relative values of this phase .",
    "unfortunately , this analysis is confounded by the tensor - product structure of multiparticle quantum states , making this point inconclusive .",
    "still , according the so - called @xmath1-epistemic approaches to quantum theory @xcite , this tensor product structure naturally arises for states of knowledge , not the underlying ( hidden ) states of reality . and with the experimental fact of relative phase measurements requiring some underlying explanation , @xmath1-epistemic approaches ( at least ) might be more inclined to see phase as a hidden variable rather than mere gauge .    these arguments are certainly not conclusive , but if global phase",
    "_ could _ be a hidden variable , it is certainly not advisable to immediately dismiss it up front . and",
    "if one does not discard the phase , the quaternion form of spinors is arguably the best way to see how the phase is interrelated with the qubit .",
    "( indeed , the fact that these two can not be cleanly separated is another reason to keep the phase . )",
    "the chief implication of this viewpoint is that it appears more natural to extend the dynamics , as outlined in section 4.3 ; this issue will now be discussed in detail .",
    "sections 3 and 4 demonstrated that when the standard dynamical equations for a spin-1/2 state in a magnetic field are written in quaternionic form , the first - order equations reveal a broken symmetry .",
    "namely , one particular pure unit quaternion @xmath117 must be singled out from all others ( for the map @xmath25 used in most of the above analysis , this corresponds to @xmath189 . )",
    "another way to see this broken symmetry is via the lagrangian that would generate the schrdinger - pauli equation . for a spin-1/2 state @xmath2 ,",
    "given an arbitrary hamiltonian @xmath146 , the inner - product form of the corresponding lagrangian @xcite can be written as @xmath190    taking the imaginary part of this last inner product may look reasonable in such a form , but the inner product structure looks quite unnatural when framed in terms of quaternions @xcite . in quaternionic form , under the map",
    "@xmath25 , the last term in ( [ eq : ketl ] ) looks instead like @xmath191 , where the special pure quaternion @xmath33 makes an explicit appearance .",
    "the ultimate source of this broken symmetry is the very @xmath192 hopf fibration procedure that motivated this paper .",
    "there are an infinite number of ways to reduce a 3-sphere to a 2-sphere , each corresponding to a particular choice of @xmath117 . and crucially , this choice must be made before the lagrangian can even be written down .",
    "in other words , the symmetry that relates the possible different hopf fibrations is not evident at the level of the lagrangian or the dynamics of @xmath2 ; it is only evident on the higher - level representation of @xmath193 , where the unit quaternions reside .",
    "furthermore , this symmetry need not be broken at all .",
    "so long as one is willing to extend the lagrangian ( and dynamics ) to a second - order form , it becomes easy to write a harmonic - oscillator - like lagrangian in terms of quaternions , without reference to any particular hopf fibration : @xmath194 remarkably , if @xmath0 is constrained to remain a unit quaternion ( which can be imposed via @xmath195 ) , there is no obvious new physics implied by this higher - order form .",
    "of course , @xmath133 will have a richer structure , in that it will obey the second - order differential equation ( [ eq : bkge ] ) and it will require more initial data to solve .",
    "( instead of merely an initial value of @xmath0 , it will require initial values of both @xmath0 and @xmath196 . ) but these additional parameters turn out to be equivalent to the original ( arbitrary ) choice of @xmath117 , so _",
    "whatever _ they happen to be , the resulting dynamics can always be cast back into the first - order form ( [ eq : vspe ] ) .",
    "the choice of map @xmath134 between spinors and quaternions is no longer an arbitrary choice , but is determined by the now - meaningful ( and effectively hidden ) parameter @xmath117 .    as discussed in section 4.3 ,",
    "this expanded dynamics does not encompass any new solutions that might be interpreted as antimatter , and therefore this is not a disguised form of the dirac equation . looking at the level of the lagrangians ( [ eq : ketl ] ) and ( [ eq:2ndl ] ) , it seems this procedure is instead analogous to the extension from the ( first - order ) dirac equation to the ( second - order ) feynman - gell - mann equation , or `` second order fermions '' as they are known in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the above proposal has no spatial component in the equation , merely spin ; through this analogy , one might call the solutions to ( [ eq : bkge ] ) `` second order qubits ''",
    ".    the most obvious implication of these second order qubits is that the hidden parameter space is much larger than a mere global phase .",
    "now it also includes the two free parameters in @xmath117 .",
    "indeed , with 3 free hidden parameters now corresponding to the same point on the bloch sphere , the hidden sector is now _ larger _ than the measurable sector .",
    "( if one considers the phase `` half - measureable '' , via relative phase measurements , then this might fall under the umbrella of theories in which one can know exactly half of the ontological parameters , as in @xcite . ) a future publication will discuss potential uses of this large hidden variable space in the context of entangled qubits .",
    "a more immediate consequence of this formalism is that it strongly indicates that quantum states evolving like @xmath197 should not be interpreted as having less energy than standard @xmath198 states , but instead exactly the same energy .",
    "classical physics is perfectly clear on this fact ( there are no negative - energy - density classical fields ) , but the single - time - derivative form of ( [ eq : sse ] ) has obscured the time - even nature of energy when it comes to quantum systems .",
    "second order ( quaternionic ) qubits , on the other hand , have a time evolution that goes like @xmath199 , demonstrating a smoothly continuous set of solutions that pass from @xmath200 to @xmath162 . in order for the sign of the energy to flip , one of the intermediate solutions must either have zero energy or some strange discontinuity that would destroy the above symmetries .    finally , it is worth stressing that when going from first - order to second - order , despite the dramatic change in the lagrangian and the dynamical equations , there are remarkably few physical consequences . given the @xmath201 normalization constraint , there are no new spurious solutions that can not be interpreted as a standard spin-1/2 state , no unusual dynamics that would lead to a new prediction .",
    "in fact , even though this procedure was motivated by viewing the global phase as more than mere gauge , at this point there seems no reason why one could not view the entire hidden parameter sector ( the phase plus @xmath117 , or @xmath112 ) as a new , larger gauge to be fixed .",
    "such a project is beyond the scope of this paper , but would be interesting to explore .",
    "although it is standard practice to remove the global phase of a given spinor , there is no continuous way to do this to the space of _ all _ spinors , even if one separately keeps track of a phase parameter @xmath16 .",
    "this means that one can not choose phase factors for all qubits that would vary continuously over the entire bloch sphere .",
    "@xcite    one possible reading of this topological fact is that the global phase of a spin-1/2 state should be treated as mere gauge , simply because it can not be universally defined . but following this logic",
    ", there should be no reason to use spinors at all ; one would simply represent spin-1/2 states as points on a 2-sphere , and use so(3 ) rather than su(2 ) .",
    "the reason this is not done is because it would throw away valuable phase information ; for example , the geometric phase accumulated by a precession around the bloch sphere .",
    "( again , considering that these berry phases are in fact measureable , it seems reckless to assume they are a meaningless gauge . )    instead , we argue that a cleaner approach is to not remove the global phase at _ any _ stage of the analysis . given this ,",
    "the most natural mathematical object to encode the state space of a spin-1/2 particle is a unit vector on a 3-sphere , or a unit quaternion .",
    "symmetries of the state space are then the same as the symmetries on the 3-sphere .",
    "but from this starting point , it appears difficult to map a unit quaternion to a ( well - defined ) spin - state on the bloch sphere without breaking these very symmetries .",
    "specifically , choosing one particular hopf fibration is equivalent to choosing a special pure quaternion , which then makes the original phase look discontinuous over the reduced state space ( perhaps encouraging one to again discard it ) .",
    "remarkably , there is an alternate path , that does not require breaking any symmetries or discarding any phases .",
    "the essential idea is to expand the state space to include _ two _ quaternions , orthogonal to each other on the 3-sphere .",
    "( these two quaternions correspond to @xmath0 and @xmath196 for second order qubits , and their orthogonality @xmath202 ensures the @xmath203 normalization is preserved . ) for a given @xmath0 , the allowed values of @xmath196 then lie on a @xmath204-sphere , and @xmath196 effectively encodes _ which _ hopf fibration one should use to map @xmath0 to the bloch sphere .",
    "after this map has been performed , the same dynamics on the bloch sphere is recovered , no matter which particular @xmath196 generated the map in the first place .",
    "from this perspective the possible values of @xmath196 might be seen as a enlarged gauge group . but given the real second - order lagrangian ( [ eq:2ndl ] ) that naturally generates the equations of motion relating @xmath0 and @xmath196 , it would be a stretch to treat the former as ontological and the latter as a gauge .",
    "an alternative viewpoint is that @xmath196 is effectively a hidden variable , one that may find uses in novel approaches to quantum foundations .",
    "one minimal example of a new direction that may be inspired by such a viewpoint results from rewriting the traditional bloch sphere vector @xmath39 $ ] in terms of the canonical momentum of the lagrangian @xmath205 . from ( [ eq:2ndl ] )",
    "one finds @xmath206 ; then using ( [ eq : vqhat ] ) and the effective dynamical equation ( [ eq : vspe ] ) , it transpires that @xmath30 is simply @xmath207 . in other words , in the second - order qubit framework , the traditional quantum state @xmath208 $ ] naturally encodes the very underlying phase - space product crucial to the `` old '' quantum theory , but does not encode which particular phase - space orbit is hidden in @xmath133 and @xmath209 .    even without enlarging the state space to this extent ,",
    "viewing spinors in quaternion form has other advantages , most notably a straightforward way to implement time - reversal via left - multiplication .",
    "more general non - unitary transformations also become easily available , which may be of interest to the field of quantum information ( as well as any foundational proposals in which pure states naturally become mixed , via some new non - unitary process ) . finally , note",
    "that this recasting of quantum states allows pure states to have the same mathematical structure as generic ( but phaseless ) unitary operators ; these can both correspond to unit quaternions . in quaternion form , then , a spin state is more naturally viewed as a _",
    "rotation _ ; perhaps unsurprising , given that these states encode angular momentum , but an interesting perspective nonetheless .",
