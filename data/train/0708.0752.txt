    "a collision between two atoms is a fundamental physical process and can be described by a few partial scattering waves for ultracold atoms . at a sufficiently low temperature the kinetic energy of colliding atoms becomes less than the centrifugal barrier , and only the @xmath0-wave scattering is possible .",
    "the @xmath0-wave scattering length is an essential parameter for describing ultracold collisions .",
    "it also governs the static and dynamic properties of quantum degenerate gases like a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) or a degenerate fermi gas ( dfg ) of fermionic atoms in different spin states .",
    "since the @xmath0-wave scattering length is very sensitive to the ground state interatomic potential , especially at short internuclear distance , the precise _ ab initio _ calculation of the scattering length is very difficult , and therefore we must resort to experimental determination .",
    "the most powerful approach for determining the scattering length is to measure the binding energy ( @xmath19 ) of the last few bound states in the molecular ground state , since the energy @xmath19 is closely related to the @xmath0-wave scattering length .",
    "so far , the binding energies were measured via two - color photoassociation ( pa ) spectroscopy for li @xcite , na @xcite , k @xcite , rb @xcite , cs @xcite and he @xcite .",

    "if a laser field @xmath20 is resonant to a bound - bound transition , it causes an autler - townes doublet .",
    "this effect is detected as a reduction of a rate of a free - bound pa transition driven by the other laser field @xmath21 .",
    "this scheme is called autler - townes spectroscopy , and it is also explained in terms of the formation of a dark state . if both lasers are off - resonant and the frequency difference matches @xmath19 , these lasers drive a stimulated raman transition from the colliding atom pair to a molecular state in the electronic ground state . in this raman spectroscopy ,",
    "the resonance is detected as an atom loss .",
    "the @xmath0-wave scattering length of two colliding atoms is determined by the adiabatic born - oppenheimer interaction potential @xmath22 between the two atoms , which is very well approximated at large interatomic separation @xmath23 by the van der waals contribution , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the van der waals coefficient due to the dipole - dipole interaction .",

    "one of the unique features of yb atoms is a rich variety of isotopes with five spinless bosons ( @xmath2yb , @xmath4yb , @xmath8yb , @xmath12yb , @xmath14yb ) and two fermions ( @xmath6yb with the nuclear spin @xmath45 and @xmath10yb with @xmath46 ) , which enables us to study various mixtures of degenerate gases of yb atoms .",
    "in fact , recently , a bec @xcite and a dfg @xcite of yb atoms have been achieved .",
    "another distinct feature of yb atoms is the simple electronic ground state of @xmath47 symmetry .",
    "therefore , the ground molecular state of yb has only one potential of @xmath48 molecular symmetry with no electronic orbital and spin angular momenta .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of an alkali dimer which has spin - singlet @xmath49 and spin - triplet @xmath50 ground states with a complicated hyperfine structure .",
    "these two unique features of the yb system , that is , the existence of rich variety of isotopes and one simple isotope - independent molecular potential , offers the possibility to systematically check the scattering length theory with an unprecedented precision .",
    "if we can be confident in the theory , then it would enable us to determine the scattering lengths of all possible isotope pairs which are not measured experimentally .",
    "so far , to determine the @xmath0-wave scattering length of @xmath12yb , one - color pa spectroscopy was performed @xcite , which gave the result of @xmath51 nm . from the cross - dimensional rethermalization technique , the absolute value of the scattering length for @xmath10yb was estimated as @xmath52 nm @xcite , assuming that the spin was completely unpolarized",
    ". however , these two values are not enough for a rigorous test of the theory .    in this paper , we report an accurate determination of the @xmath0-wave scattering lengths for all yb isotopes including those for different isotope pairs . by using two - color pa spectroscopy with the intercombination transition @xmath53 , we successfully determined the binding energy @xmath19 of twelve bound states near the dissociation limit of four homonuclear dimers comprised of bosonic atoms ( @xmath4yb@xmath54 , @xmath8yb@xmath54 , @xmath12yb@xmath54 , and @xmath14yb@xmath54 ) and two dimers comprised of fermionic atoms ( @xmath6yb@xmath54 and @xmath10yb@xmath54 ) .",
    "the spectroscopically measured binding energies are in excellent agreement with theoretical calculations based on a simple model potential that was fit to the data .",
    "the calculated @xmath0-wave scattering lengths for the six isotopes obey the mass - scaling law with very good precision .",
    "moreover , this excellent agreement allows us to accurately determine the scattering lengths of all twenty - eight different isotopic combinations .",
    "in addition , we can reveal scattering properties of other partial waves such as @xmath55- and @xmath56-wave scatterings and energy dependence of the elastic cross sections .",
    "these results are an important foundation for future research , such as the efficiency of evaporative cooling , stability of quantum gases and their mixtures , and the clock shift @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup was almost the same as our previous experiment of one - color pa spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "all the experiments were performed at about 1 @xmath57k , where only the @xmath0-wave scattering is possible .",
    "atoms were first collected in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) with the intercombination transition @xmath53 at @xmath58 nm .",
    "the linewidth and saturation intensity of the transition were @xmath59 khz and @xmath60 mw/@xmath61 , respectively .",
    "the laser beam for the mot was generated by a dye laser whose linewidth was narrowed to less than @xmath62 khz .",
    "the dye laser was stabilized by an ultralow expansion cavity , whose frequency drift was typically less than @xmath63 hz / s .",
    "the number , density and temperature of atoms in the mot were about @xmath64 , @xmath65 @xmath66 and 40 @xmath30k , respectively .",
    "then the atoms were transferred into a crossed far - off resonant trap ( fort ) .",
    "the number , density and temperature of atoms in the fort were about @xmath67 , @xmath68 @xmath66 , and 100 @xmath30k , respectively . to reach lower temperatures ,",
    "evaporative cooling was carried out by gradually decreasing the potential depth of the horizontal fort beam to several tens of @xmath57k in several seconds .",
    "evaporative cooling worked rather well for the bosonic isotopes , @xmath4yb , @xmath8yb and @xmath12yb and for the fermionic isotope @xmath10yb .",
    "typically @xmath69 atoms at the temperature of about 1 @xmath30k finally remained in the trap and the density was between @xmath68 @xmath66 and @xmath70 @xmath66 , although optimized evaporation ramps and efficiency for each isotope were different .",
    "in particular , we observed rapid atom decay for @xmath8yb due to three - body recombination .",
    "the steeper evaporation ramp was needed for @xmath8yb to obtain enough number of atoms .",
    "it is also noted that an unpolarized sample of @xmath10yb enabled us to perform efficient evaporative cooling even at a low temperature via elastic collisions between atoms with different spins .",
    "for the bosonic @xmath14yb and fermionic @xmath6yb isotopes , however , the evaporative cooling did not work well . in order to cool @xmath6yb and @xmath14yb , we performed sympathetic cooling with bosonic @xmath12yb  @xcite .",
    "bichromatic mot beams for simultaneous trapping of two isotopes in the mot were generated by an electro - optic modulator ( eom ) , of which the modulation frequency corresponds to the isotope shift .",
    "typically @xmath71 atoms for @xmath6yb and @xmath72 atoms for @xmath14yb at the temperature of about @xmath73 @xmath57k finally remained in the trap .",
    "the bosonic isotope of @xmath2yb was hard to collect in the mot due to its small natural abundance of 0.13 percent , although there are no fundamental difficulties for @xmath2yb in principle .",
    "after the evaporative cooling , the two lasers , @xmath21 for the free - bound transition and @xmath20 for the bound - bound transition , were simultaneously applied to the atoms in the trap for about 30 ms .",
    "these beams were focused to a @xmath62 @xmath57 m diameter . the schematic setup for the pa lasers is represented in fig .  [ fig : palaser ] .",
    "the two laser beams were prepared by splitting one laser beam for the mot and therefore had the same frequency linewidth and stability as the mot beam .",
    "the relative frequency was controlled by acousto - optic modulators ( aoms ) .",
    "the two laser beams were coupled in the same optical fiber .",
    "a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) and a half - wave ( @xmath74 ) plate after the optical fiber were inserted to fix the polarization of both lasers in the same direction .",
    "finally , the pa laser beams were aligned to pass through the atoms in the fort by using a ccd camera for absorption imaging .",

    "the efficient evaporative cooling for @xmath4yb , @xmath10yb , and @xmath12yb is consistent with the large scattering lengths : @xmath152 nm for @xmath4yb , @xmath153 nm for @xmath10yb , and @xmath154 nm for @xmath12yb .",
    "inefficient evaporative cooling for @xmath6yb and @xmath14yb is also consistent with the small scattering lengths @xmath155 nm for @xmath6yb and @xmath156 nm for @xmath14yb . on the other hand ,",
    "we have successfully used sympathetic cooling to cool @xmath6yb and @xmath14yb with @xmath12yb , for which the respective mixed - isotope scattering lengths are 22 nm and 2.9 nm .",
    "the extremely large value of @xmath157 nm for @xmath8yb would explain very rapid atom decay observed for this system , which could be due to three - body recombination .",
    "using the three - parameter model potential , we can also calculate the collisional properties of other partial waves at non - zero collision energies .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma ] shows the energy - dependent cross section for the collision of like isotopic species .",
    "the cross section can be resonantly enhanced by a shape resonance , caused by the existence of quasibound rovibrational levels supported by the centrifugal barrier .",
    "a @xmath56-wave shape resonance exists for @xmath12yb as already pointed out in refs .",
    "our model predicts a broad peak in the collision cross section near @xmath158 mhz , or @xmath159 @xmath57k , which is off - scale in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] .",
    "we found that a low energy @xmath55-wave shape resonance also exists for @xmath10yb , giving rise to a peak in the cross section near @xmath160 @xmath57k .",
    "the @xmath0-wave contribution to the cross section becomes zero when the @xmath0-wave collisional phase shift is zero .",
    "such a zero as a function of energy results in a ramsauer - townsend minimum in the cross section .",
    "this minimum is especially evident when the collision energy is so small that other partial waves make negligible contributions to the cross section , this effect occurs at very low collision energy when the scattering length has a small negative value , as for @xmath6yb and for @xmath14yb .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma ] shows the calculated cross section minima near 2 @xmath57k and 25 @xmath57k for these respective species .",
    "this effect explains why evaporative cooling is found to be inefficient for these isotopes .",
    "in conclusion , we report the accurate determination of the binding energies of the twelve least bound states in the ground molecular potentials for six yb isotopes and the accurate determination of the @xmath0-wave scattering lengths for all possible combination of the isotopes based on a simple three - parameter model potential .",
    "the model parameters are based on fitting a very limited set of the experimental data , making use of only three binding energies : two bound - states of @xmath12yb@xmath54 and one bound - state of @xmath14yb@xmath54 .",
    "fitting this limited set of data allows us to reproduce the other nine binding energies with an accuracy of about 100 khz and to determine the 28 scattering lengths for the different isotope combinations with an accuracy of about a few percent for most cases .",
    "in addition , we can calculate the energy - dependent elastic scattering due to other partial waves such as @xmath55- and @xmath56- waves .",
    "these results provide an important foundation for future research with yb atoms on such topics as the efficiency of evaporative cooling , the stability of quantum gases and their mixtures , and clock shifts .",
