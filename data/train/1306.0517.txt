    "bandwidth selection is a key issue in kernel density estimation that has deserved considerable attention during the last decades .",
    "the problem of selecting the most suitable bandwidth for the nonparametric kernel density estimator introduced by @xcite and @xcite is the main topic of the reviews of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , among others .",
    "comprehensive references on kernel smoothing and bandwidth selection include the books by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "bandwidth selection is still an active research field in density estimation , with some recent contributions like @xcite and @xcite in the last years . + kernel density estimation has been also adapted to directional data , that is , data in the unit hypersphere of dimension @xmath0 .",
    "due to the particular nature of directional data ( periodicity for @xmath1 and manifold structure for any @xmath0 ) , the usual multivariate techniques are not appropriate and specific methodology that accounts for their characteristics has to be considered .",
    "the classical references for the theory of directional statistics are the complete review of @xcite and the book by @xcite .",
    "the kernel density estimation with directional data was firstly proposed by @xcite , studying the properties of two types of kernel density estimators and providing cross - validatory bandwidth selectors .",
    "almost simultaneously , @xcite provided a similar definition of kernel estimator , establishing its pointwise and @xmath2 consistency .",
    "some of the results by @xcite were extended by @xcite , who studied the estimation of the laplacian of the density and other types of derivatives . whereas the framework for all these references is the general @xmath0-sphere , which comprises as particular case the circle ( @xmath1 ) , there exists a remarkable collection of works devoted to kernel density estimation and bandwidth selection for the circular scenario .",
    "specifically , @xcite presented the first plug - in bandwidth selector in this context and @xcite derived a selector based on mixtures and on the results of @xcite for the circular asymptotic mean integrated squared error ( amise ) .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed a product kernel density estimator on the @xmath0-dimensional torus and cross - validatory bandwidth selection methods for that situation .",
    "another nonparametric approximation for density estimation with circular data was given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in the general setting of spherical random fields @xcite derived an estimation method based on a needlet basis representation .",
    "+ directional data arise in many applied fields . for the circular case ( @xmath1 ) a typical example is wind direction , studied among others in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the spherical case ( @xmath3 ) poses challenging applications in astronomy , for example in the study of stars position in the celestial sphere or in the study of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite . finally , a novel field where directional data is present for large @xmath0 is text mining @xcite , where documents are usually codified as high dimensional unit vectors .",
    "for all these situations , a reliable method for choosing the bandwidth parameter seems necessary to trust the density estimate .",
    "+ the aim of this work is to introduce new bandwidth selectors for the kernel density estimator for directional data .",
    "the first one is a rule of thumb which assumes that the underlying density is a von mises and it is intended to be the directional analogue of the rule of thumb proposed by @xcite for data in the real line .",
    "this selector uses the amise expression that can be seen , among others , in @xcite .",
    "the novelty of the selector is that it is more general and robust than the previous proposal by @xcite , although both rules exhibit an unsatisfactory behaviour when the reference density spreads off from the von mises . to overcome this problem , two new selectors based on the use of mixtures of von mises for the reference density",
    "are proposed .",
    "one of them uses the aforementioned amise expression , whereas the other one uses the exact mise computation for mixtures of von mises densities given in @xcite .",
    "both of them use the expectation - maximization algorithm of @xcite to fit the mixtures and , to select the number of components , the bic criteria is employed .",
    "these selectors based on mixtures are inspired by the earlier ideas of @xcite , for the multivariate setting , and @xcite for the circular scenario .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ kdebwd : sec : kdedir ] presents some background on kernel density estimation for directional data and the available bandwidth selectors .",
    "the rule of thumb selector is introduced in section [ kdebwd : sec : ruleofthumb ] and the two selectors based on mixtures of von mises are presented in section [ kdebwd : sec : mixtures ] .",
    "section [ kdebwd : sec : comparative ] contains a simulation study comparing the proposed selectors with the ones available in the literature .",
    "finally , section [ kdebwd : sec : data ] illustrates a real data application and some conclusions are given in section [ kdebwd : sec : conclusions ] .",
    "supplementary materials with proofs , simulated models and extended tables are given in the appendix .",
    "denote by @xmath4 a directional random variable with density @xmath5 .",
    "the support of such variable is the @xmath0-dimensional sphere , namely @xmath6 , endowed with the lebesgue measure in @xmath7 , that will be denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "then , a directional density is a nonnegative function that satisfies @xmath9 .",
    "also , when there is no possible confusion , the area of @xmath7 will be denoted by @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the gamma function defined as @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "+ among the directional distributions , the von mises - fisher distribution ( see @xcite ) is perhaps the most widely used .",
    "the von mises density , denoted by @xmath14 , is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the directional mean , @xmath17 the concentration parameter around the mean , @xmath18 stands for the transpose operator and @xmath19 is the modified bessel function of order @xmath20 , @xmath21 this distribution is the main reference for directional models and , in that sense , plays the role of the normal distribution for directional data ( is also a multivariate normal @xmath22 conditioned on @xmath7 ; see @xcite ) . a particular case of this density sets @xmath23 , which corresponds to the uniform density that assigns probability @xmath24 to any direction in @xmath7 .",
    "+ given a random sample @xmath25 from the directional random variable @xmath4 , the proposal of @xcite for the directional kernel density estimator at a point @xmath26 is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a directional kernel ( a rapidly decaying function with nonnegative values and defined in @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 is the bandwidth parameter and @xmath31 is a normalizing constant .",
    "this constant is needed in order to ensure that the estimator is indeed a density and satisfies that @xmath32 as usual in kernel smoothing , the selection of the bandwidth is a crucial step that affects notably the final estimation : large values of @xmath33 result in a uniform density in the sphere , whereas small values of @xmath33 provide an undersmoothed estimator with high concentrations around the sample observations . on the other hand ,",
    "the choice of the kernel is not seen as important for practical purposes and the most common choice is the so called von mises kernel @xmath34 . its name is due to the fact that the kernel estimator can be viewed as a mixture of von mises - fisher densities as follows : @xmath35 where , for each von mises component , the mean value is the @xmath36-th observation @xmath37 and the common concentration parameter is given by @xmath38 .",
    "+ the classical error measurement in kernel density estimation is the @xmath39 distance between the estimator @xmath40 and the target density @xmath5 , the so called integrated squared error ( ise ) . as this is a random quantity depending on the sample , its expected value , the mean integrated squared error ( mise ) ,",
    "is usually considered : @xmath41{\\right]}}={\\mathbb{e}{\\left[}{\\int_{\\omega_{q } } { \\left(\\hat f_h({\\mathbf{x}})-f({\\mathbf{x}})\\right)}^2\\,\\omega_{q}(d { \\mathbf{x}})}{\\right]}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which depends on the bandwidth @xmath33 , the kernel @xmath28 , the sample size @xmath42 and the target density @xmath5 . whereas the two last elements are fixed when estimating a density from a random sample , the bandwidth has to be chosen ( also the kernel , although this does not present a big impact in the performance of the estimator ) .",
    "then , a possibility is to search for the bandwidth that minimizes the mise : @xmath43 to derive an easier form for the mise that allows to obtain @xmath44 , the following conditions on the elements of the estimator ( [ kdebwd : kernel_directional ] ) are required :    1 .",

    "this idea was employed first by @xcite considering mixtures of multivariate normals and by @xcite in the circular setting .",
    "+ the second improvement is concerned with the error criterion for the choice of the bandwidth . until now , the error criterion considered was the amise , which is the usual in the literature of kernel smoothing . however , as @xcite showed for the linear case and @xcite did for the directional situation , the amise and mise may differ significantly for moderate and even large sample sizes , with a potential significative misfit between @xmath99 and @xmath92 . then",

    "obviously , the problem of this new approach is how to compute exactly the mise , but this can be done if the reference density is a mixture of von mises .",
    "+ the previous two considerations , improve the reference density and the error criterion , will lead to the bandwidth selectors of asymptotic mixtures ( ami ) , denoted by @xmath100 , and exact mixtures ( emi ) , denoted by @xmath101 . before explaining in detail the two proposed selectors , it is required to introduce some notation on mixtures of von mises .",

    "a common feature of all these densities is that they are rotationally symmetric , that is , their contourlines are @xmath161-spheres orthogonal to a particular direction .",
    "this characteristic can be exploited by means of the so called tangent - normal decomposition ( see @xcite ) , that leads to the change of variables @xmath163 where @xmath164 is a fixed vector , @xmath165 ( measures the distance of @xmath166 from @xmath153 ) , @xmath167 and @xmath168 is the semi - orthonormal matrix ( @xmath169 and @xmath170 , with @xmath171 the @xmath0-identity matrix ) resulting from the completion of @xmath153 to the orthonormal basis @xmath172 .",
    "the family of rotationally symmetric densities can be parametrized as @xmath173 where @xmath174 is a function depending on a vector parameter @xmath175 and such that @xmath176 is a density in @xmath177 , for all @xmath178 .",

    "a reasonable solution to this ( for a fixed choice of @xmath174 and @xmath153 ) is to evaluate once the quantile function in a dense grid ( for example , @xmath145 points equispaced in @xmath185 ) , save the grid and use it to interpolate using cubic splines the new evaluations , which is computationally fast .    extending these ideas for rotationally symmetric models ,",
    "two new directional densities are proposed .",
    "the first one is the directional cauchy density @xmath186 , defined as an analogy with the usual cauchy distribution as @xmath187 where @xmath153 is the mode direction and @xmath17 the concentration parameter around it ( @xmath23 gives the uniform density ) .",
    "this density shares also some of the characteristics of the usual cauchy distribution : high concentration around a peaked mode and a power decay of the density .",
    "the other proposed density is the skew normal directional density @xmath188 , @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the skew normal density of @xcite with location @xmath191 , scale @xmath192 and shape @xmath193 that is truncated to the interval @xmath177 .",
    "the density is inspired by the wrapped skew normal distribution of @xcite , although it is based on the rotationally symmetry rather than in wrapping techniques .",
    "a particular form of this density is an homogeneous `` cap '' in a neighbourhood of @xmath153 that decreases very fast outside of it .",
    "+ non rotationally symmetric densities can be created by mixtures of rotationally symmetric .",
    "however , it is interesting to introduce a purely non rotationally symmetric density : the projected normal distribution of @xcite . denoted by @xmath194 , the corresponding densityis @xmath195 where @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "sampling from this distribution is extremely easy : just sample @xmath200 and then project @xmath4 to @xmath7 by @xmath201 .",
    "+ the whole collection of models , with @xmath202 densities in total , are detailed in table [ kdebwd : tab : models ] in appendix [ kdebwd : ap : models ] .",
    "figures [ kdebwd : fig : circ ] and [ kdebwd : fig : sph ] show the plots of these densities for the circular and spherical cases .      for the circular case , the comparative study has been done for the @xmath202 models described in figure [ kdebwd : fig : circ ] ( see table [ kdebwd : tab : models ] to see their densities ) , for the circular selectors @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath86 , @xmath78 , @xmath82 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 and for the sample sizes @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 and @xmath97 . due to space limitations ,",
    "only the results for sample size @xmath209 are shown in table [ kdebwd : tab : cir ] , and the rest of them are relegated to appendix [ kdebwd : ap : tables ] .",
    "+ in addition , to help summarizing the results a ranking similar to ranking b of @xcite will be constructed .",
    "the ranking will be computed according to the following criteria : for each model , the @xmath191 bandwidth selectors @xmath210 considered are sorted from the best performance ( lowest error ) to the worst performance ( largest error ) .",
    "the best bandwidth receives @xmath191 points , the second @xmath211 and so on .",
    "these points , denoted by @xmath212 , are standardized by @xmath191 and multiplied by the relative performance of each selector compared with the best one .",
    "in other words , the points of the selector @xmath213 , if @xmath214 is the best one , are @xmath215 .",
    "the final score for each selector is the sum of the ranks obtained in all the twenty models ( thus , a selector which is the best in all models will have @xmath202 points ) . with this ranking , it is easy to group the results in a single and easy to read table .",
    "+ in view of the results , the following conclusions can be extracted .",
    "firstly , @xmath85 performs well in certain unimodal models such as m3 ( von mises ) and m6 ( skew normal directional ) , but its performance is very poor with multimodal models like m15 ( watson ) . in its particular comparison with @xmath83 , it can be observed that both selectors share the same order of error , but being @xmath85 better in all the situations except for one : the uniform model ( m1 ) .",
    "this is due to the `` extra term '' commented in section [ kdebwd : sec : ruleofthumb ] : its absence in the denominator makes that @xmath216 faster than @xmath85 when the concentration parameter @xmath217 and , what is a disadvantage for @xmath218 , turns out in an advantage for the uniform case . with respect to @xmath100 and @xmath101 , although their performance becomes more similar when the sample size increases , something expected , @xmath101 seems to be on average a step ahead from @xmath100 , specially for low sample sizes . among the cross - validated selectors , @xmath219 performs better than @xmath73 , a fact that was previously noted by simulation studies carried out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath220 presents the most competitive behaviour among the previous proposals in the literature when the sample size is reasonably large ( see table [ kdebwd : tab : rankcirsph ] ) .",
    "+ the comparison between the circular selectors is summarized in the scores of table [ kdebwd : tab : rankcirsph ] .",
    "for all the sample sizes considered , @xmath101 is the most competitive selector , followed by @xmath100 for all the sample sizes except @xmath221 , where @xmath219 is the second .",
    "the effect of the sample effect is also interesting to comment .",
    "for @xmath221 , @xmath219 and @xmath85 perform surprisingly well , in contrast with @xmath220 , which is the second worst selector for this case .",
    "when the sample size increases , @xmath85 and @xmath83 have a decreasing performance and @xmath220 stretches differences with @xmath100 , showing a similar behaviour .",
    "this was something expected as both selectors are based on error criteria that are asymptotically equivalent .",
    "the cross - validated selectors show a stable performance for sample sizes larger than@xmath221 .",
