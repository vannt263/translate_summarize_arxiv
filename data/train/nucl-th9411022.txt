    "in order to derive the effective @xmath1 and @xmath2exchange potentials we use the same procedure as in ref .  @xcite ; namely , we first perform dispersion integrals over the unitarity cut using as input the @xmath0 amplitudes derived in the foregoing section .",

    "alternatively , we could have used a method proposed by frazer and fulco @xcite and applied by hhler and pietarinen @xcite .",
    "here , one first constructs combinations @xmath118 corresponding to vector ( @xmath119 ) and tensor ( @xmath120 ) coupling amplitudes    [ gamma ] @xmath121 @xmath122    and then performs the dispersion integrals over the unitarity cut , @xmath123 differences in the resulting potentials originate from the additional @xmath5dependence in @xmath124 compared to @xmath117 . despite this fact , since @xmath124 have the same analytic structure as @xmath117 , both methods would in principle lead to the same results provided all cut contributions would be taken into account in the dispersion integrals .",
    "indeed , diagrams included in correlated two  pion exchange also give rise to left hand cuts . in the example shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : rhobox ] the @xmath125 intermediate state is the source of a branch cut in the complex @xmath5 plane extending from @xmath126 to @xmath127 . in fact , there is an infinite number of such left hand cuts generated by all processes contributing to correlated correlated two ",
    "pion exchange and it is by far impossible to include these pieces .",

    "( cutting off the integration over the unitarity cut at @xmath128 turns out to play a minor role only . )",
    "these differences can be nicely demonstrated by parametrizing the resulting potentials in terms of effective @xmath5dependent @xmath2coupling strengths @xmath129 defined by @xmath130 where @xmath124 is either obtained by inserting @xmath131 calculated using eq .",

    "( [ gamma ] ) is rather weak , the resulting @xmath138 does not differ much .",
    "but the factor of @xmath5 in @xmath119 leads to a much smaller @xmath139 if @xmath124 are dispersed .      our model for correlated @xmath19 exchange",
    "is supplemented by direct and exchange pole diagrams involving the nucleon and @xmath53isobar , and is then unitarized by means of a relativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "it has been shown in that paper that , based on the quasiempirical input for the @xmath0 process , a good description of all @xmath7 partial waves is obtained by adjusting open form factor parameters . in that paper , @xmath2 exchange as defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f1disperse ] ) has been used .",
    "we first want to discuss what happens when we now replace the quasiempirical input for correlated @xmath19 exchange by our dynamical model .",
    "the slight increase in the @xmath1channel potential ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sigpot ] ) leads to comparably weakly modified phase shifts .",
    "this effect can be compensated by a small readjustment of the cutoff parameter ( introduced in addition for the @xmath1 potential , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , from 1200 mev to 1120 mev . there is almost no change in the @xmath2 channel provided the same ansatz is used as in ref .",
    ". therefore a quantitative description of @xmath9 and @xmath10 waves is obtained with precisely the same values for parameters in pole and exchange diagrams as in ref .",
    "@xcite ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : spwaves ] ) .",
    "corresponding scattering lengths and volumes are given in table [ tab : sl ] .",
    "however , a dramatic change occurs if the @xmath2exchange potential is evaluated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammadisp ] ) .",
    "there is a strong reduction in the @xmath140 phase shift predictions , with smaller modifications in other partial waves ( dashed lines of fig .",
    "[ fig : spwaves ] ) .",
    "the latter can be eliminated by suitably readjusting parameters in the pole and exchange diagrams , but the discrepancy in @xmath140 essentially remains .    in view of this situation , one may ask if the @xmath7 data can discriminate between the different formulations for @xmath2 exchange . within the strict confines of our model , it could be argued that it does . on the other hand , the discrepancy could be an indicator of the absence of an important ingredient still missing in the @xmath140 interaction .",
    "indeed , there is empirically well  established resonant structure in that partial wave at higher energies , which can not be reproduced by either model .",
    "one source for the required additional attraction in @xmath140 is the strong coupling of this partial wave to the reaction channel @xmath141 .",
    "a second source of attraction is provided by @xmath142 ( 1535 , 1650 ) pole diagrams in the @xmath7 interaction .",
    "if direct coupling of the form @xmath143 is assumed at the @xmath144 vertex this process gives rise to attraction in the @xmath140 partial wave of @xmath7 scattering starting from the @xmath7 threshold .    to demonstrate the power of these additional degrees of freedom , in fig .",
    "[ fig : refit ] the result of a simple calculation starting from the second model for @xmath145 exchange is plotted where an additional @xmath146 pole diagram has been included .",
