    "after the discovery of superconductivity in lafeaso @xcite , the finding of iron - chalcogenide superconductor @xmath7-fese@xmath8 @xcite has stimulated another intensive studies on the iron - based superconductors .",
    "although the iron - chalcogenides and iron - pnictides have similar crystal and electronic structures , they show many differences either in superconductivity or in magnetism .",
    "for instance , the former has lower @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) @xcite  and a larger magnetic moment of the fe ion in fete@xmath11se@xmath8 ( @xmath12 ) , while the latter , _ e.g. _ la-1111 , has much higher @xmath13 @xcite  but has a smaller magnetic moment ( @xmath14 ) for the fe ion@xcite .",
    "even the magnetic orders are different , one is bi - collinear and the other is collinear .",
    "recently , k , cs or rb intercalated fese superconductors a@xmath0fe@xmath15se@xmath16 are found .",
    "it is shown that @xmath9 of this system can be enhanced above @xmath17 @xcite . in this system , as the atomic ratio of fe : se is not 1:1 , which used to be in iron - chalcogenides , iron deficiency is produced . as a result , in addition to the enhancement of @xmath9 , a @xmath18  iron vacancy ordered pattern illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lattice_245 ] is formed when the composition is close to k@xmath0fe@xmath19se@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the vacancy ordering is followed by the magnetic transition at lower temperature @xmath20 to the block antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phase with a big moment 3.31@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "although the afm state is observed in superconducting k@xmath22fe@xmath1se@xmath16 , evidence of nanoscale phase separation from x - ray diffraction is reported @xcite .",
    "previous theoretical works @xcite on superconductivity in the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 system were based on the band structure of kfe@xmath2se@xmath2 in which the hole pocket around @xmath23  is absent and only electron pockets are present at m. such fermi surface tomography was supported by arpes @xcite .",
    "however , since there is no experimental evidence @xcite showing the existence of the @xmath24 pattern in kfe@xmath2se@xmath2 , the validity of these approaches is questionable .",
    "in fact , because of the @xmath25 pattern , the symmetry group changes from _ i4/mmm _ to _ i4/m _ and both the unit cell and the brillouin zone ( bz ) change as well . the underlying band structure should be very different .",
    "indeed , the first - principles calculations of the @xmath24 vacancy ordered lattice structure @xcite indicate that a hole pocket at @xmath26  appears in the nonmagnetic state and as expected it loses the reflection symmetry in the _ x - y _ plane .",
    "the presence of a hole pocket at @xmath23 point indicates that the physics that drives superconductivity could be very different .",
    "it thus calls for a close examination based on an appropriate hamiltonian to model the ternary iron selenide k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 .    in this paper",
    ", we construct a two - dimensional tight - binging model with three @xmath27 orbitals for the k@xmath22fe@xmath1se@xmath2  system with the @xmath18 vacancy ordered pattern being explicitly included . based on the general tight - binding model @xmath28 with symmetry imposed by the vacancy order",
    ", we fit the dispersion relation of @xmath28 to that of the non - magnetic state from the first - principles calculations of ref .",
    "two hole pockets and two electron pockets emerges in the fitted tight - binding model .",
    "the constructed band model , when combined with generalized hubbard interactions , yields a spin susceptibility that shows a large peak around the @xmath5-vector ( @xmath6 ) for the block - checkerboard afm state .",
    "furthermore , competition of different magnetic states is found but the block - checkerboard afm state gets enhanced with larger hund s rule coupling and wins out at the end .",
    "the implication of our results to the mechanism of superconductivity is discussed . in particular",
    ", we argue that the spin fluctuations at @xmath5=(@xmath6 ) suggest that in analogy to spin - fluctuations in high @xmath9 cuprates , the interblock fluctuations of spins might play an important role in the mechanism of superconductivity occurring in this system .",
    "we start by considering the vacancy - ordered structure with right - handed chirality @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ lattice_245 ] . in this ordered state ,",
    "the unit cell includes four iron atoms ( without considering se ) , which we denote as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 and three * *  * * @xmath27 * *  * * orbitals ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ) are considered in each iron",
    ". therefore we have 12 species of electrons in a unit cell .",
    "we will suppress spin indices and denote the electron operators collectively as a vector by @xmath36 with @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes the annihilation operator of electron for orbital @xmath39 at site @xmath40 with @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 standing for @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "we will use @xmath46 and @xmath47 as the coordinates of this system and @xmath48and @xmath49 as the nearest fe - fe directions .      in previous works , the dft band structure of the parent compound kfe@xmath2se@xmath16",
    "in which only electron pockets appear at m tamaier , fawang , yzhou , tdas1,mazin is employed .",
    "however , the parent compound kfe@xmath2se@xmath2  does not have the same hopping parameters as those in the vacancy - ordered k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "for example , there is no hopping between fe atoms and vacancies .",
    "here we shall strictly enforce the @xmath3  vacancy - ordered structure and construct a tight - binding model with nearest neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) fe - fe hoppings , which will be classified as intra- and inter - cell ones .",
    "as the vacancy ordering appears , the reflection symmetry is lost but the four - fold - rotational symmetry is left intact . the system is invariant under 90@xmath50 * *  * * rotations around the center of a unit cell , which is the position of se ( if the vacancy position is taken as the rotation center , the rotation has to be followed by a @xmath51 operation : the reflection @xmath52 ) .",
    "a general hopping hamiltonian @xmath28 with vacancy order being included can be written down by imposing the 90@xmath53 right - handed rotation symmetry : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 accompanied with @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 . due to its massive form",
    ", the general form of @xmath28 is relayed to the appendix .",
    "after fourier transformation , in the momentum @xmath61 space , it takes the form @xmath62where @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 is a @xmath66 matrix .",
    "detailed characterization of all hopping parameters are tabulated in table [ intra_t ] and table inter_t in appendix .",
    "these parameters are obtained by fitting energy dispersions ( in the folded bz ) to the results of x. w. yan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained by the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in which the main features are four hole pockets at @xmath23 and four electron pockets at x in the nonmagnetic state .",
    "our fitting gives two hole and two electron pockets , which capture basic features of this system .",
    "[ ek ] shows our fitting results in the unfolded bz ( ( a ) and ( c ) ) , and in the folded bz ( ( b ) and ( d ) ) . in the folded bz ,",
    "there are two hole pockets around ( @xmath67 ) and two electron pockets around ( @xmath68 ) ; in the unfolded coordinate , one hole pocket will move to ( @xmath6 ) and electron pockets to @xmath69(@xmath70 ) .",
