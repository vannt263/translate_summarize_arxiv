    "<S> since the hubbard s works of 60 s , a great progress has been achieved in understanding electronic structure of systems with strong on - site interaction . </S>",
    "<S> last time , the role of the kondo effect has been discussed within the large-@xmath1 approach ( @xmath1 is space dimensionality ) which reduces the initial periodic hubbard model to an effective anderson impurity model @xcite . besides the hubbard bands , an important role in the formation of density of states ( dos ) </S>",
    "<S> picture belongs to a peak at the fermi level , which was found for both half - filled and doped case ( the latter case is considered in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that this approach meets with a number of computational difficulties ( e.g. , consideration of finite temperatures is needed , and the low - temperature limit is non - trivial ) . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the spectrum in large-@xmath1 approaches is confirmed by the monte - carlo calculations . on the other hand , this feature was not reproduced by most preceding analytical approaches . in particular , the hubbard - iii approximation @xcite does not take into account contributions of fermi - like excitations in a proper way because of its single - site character . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis of this approximation was performed in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite within the large-@xmath2 ( @xmath2 is nearest - neighbor number ) expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> in the present paper we present a treatment that is based on the method of equations of motion for the many - electron hubbard operators @xcite and is much more simple than the large-@xmath1 approach . as the zero order this approach reduces to the simplest hubbard - i approximation . </S>",
    "<S> general expressions for @xmath3-corrections were obtained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the terms with the one - particle occupation numbers ( which just describe the kondo effect ) were neglected in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and only a classical approximation was considered in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we start from the @xmath0-@xmath1 exchange model with the large @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling parameter @xmath4 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the band energy , @xmath7 is the heisenberg hamiltonian of the localized - spin system , @xmath8 are the pauli matrices . in the limit @xmath9 ( here and hereafter @xmath10 ) , it is convenient to pass to the atomic representation of the hubbard operators @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( the second term in ( [ eq : h0 ] ) ) takes the diagonal form @xcite . for the electron concentration @xmath13 after performing the procedure of projection onto the corresponding state space , </S>",
    "<S> the one - electron fermi operators @xmath14 are replaced by the many - electron operators @xmath15 these are expressed in terms of the @xmath16-operators as @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the empty states and @xmath19 are the singly - occupied states with the total on - site spin @xmath20 and its projection @xmath21 ( which survive at @xmath9 ) , @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of the @xmath0-@xmath1 exchange interaction yields a constant energy shift only and can be omitted , so that we obtain @xmath23 for @xmath24 we have to pass to the `` hole '' representation by introducing new localized spins @xmath25 , and the hamiltonian takes the same form ( [ eq : h ] ) with the replacement @xmath26 . for @xmath27 , @xmath28 </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) coincides with that of the hubbard model in the case of the infinite on - site repulsion @xmath29 with the replacement @xmath30 and the almost half - filled band , so that @xmath31 with @xmath32 the hole concentration . </S>",
    "<S> thus we do not need to discuss the hubbard model separately ( physically , both models describe the local - moment situation ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the one - particle green s function for ferromagnetic ( fm ) state in the energy representation , @xmath33 using the commutation relations for for the operators @xmath34 and spin operators ( cf . refs .  </S>",

    "<S> \\label{eq : b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the longitudinal fluctuations can be neglected in the saturated fm region @xcite , but are important in the paramagnetic region ( the corresponding results are obtained from the above formulas at @xmath47 ) which is considered hereafter . </S>",
    "<S> the equation for the chemical potential reads @xmath48    to smear the logarithmic dos singularity at the fermi level , one has to take into account spin dynamics which is determined by the hamiltonian @xmath49 ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the normalized spectral spin function @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the bose function . in the far paramagnetic region ( where spin correlations can be neglected ) </S>",
    "<S> we can use the simplest spin - diffusion approximation with @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the spin diffusion constant ( in fact , the results depend weakly on the concrete form of spin dynamics ) . </S>",
    "<S> then we have to put in ( [ eq : egf ] ) @xmath54 to simplify numerical calculations , we average the spectral function ( [ eq : k ] ) in  @xmath55 , @xmath56 which is sufficient to obtain qualitatively valid results . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this approximation ( which is in spirit of the large-@xmath1 or large-@xmath2 expansion ) reproduces correctly the low - frequency behavior of spin fluctuations which is important near the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath57 and @xmath58 do not depend on  @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> we have taken below @xmath60 ( @xmath61 is the transfer integral ) .    in the far paramagnetic region </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath62 then we obtain for @xmath27 @xmath63    the results of numerical calculation of the single - particle density of states @xmath64 for the semielliptic bare dos are shown in fig .  [ fig:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that pronounced density of states peaks occur at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> the peaks are smeared by both including spin dynamics and finite temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that , unlike the large-@xmath1 approach @xcite , the limit of zero temperature makes no difficulties .    as well as for small-@xmath65 kondo problem , </S>",
    "<S> the `` kondo effect '' is connected with the fermi functions ( which were not treated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and is a quantum effect that is small in @xmath66 . unlike the fm case , where the singularity has one - sided form and non - quasiparticle ( incoherent ) contributions to the density of state plays main role @xcite , the logarithmic contribution is symmetric with respect to the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> note that after formal expansion in @xmath3 the contributions to the green s function with the fermi functions are canceled in the paramagnetic phase to first order @xcite .    as discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the approximation ( [ eq : a ] ) , ( [ eq : b ] ) leads to some formal difficulties connected with occurrence of an additional singularity of the green s function in the complex plane . </S>",
    "<S> this can result in the violation of analytical properties , in particular , of the normalization condition @xmath67 where @xmath68 the analytical properties turn out to be different for the cases of positive and negative @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath69 the singularity lies in the upper half - plane , and for @xmath70 in the lower one , so that the normalization condition is violated for @xmath71 although this violation is numerically not too large ( see table  [ tab:1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this difficulty does not seem to lead to unphysical conclusions in our simple approximation , since the results for the dos picture in both the cases are qualitatively similar . </S>",
    "<S> however , it should be stressed that this problem has a rather general character and is typical for most calculations which use the many - electron hubbard representation ( or related slave - boson and slave - fermion representations which include constraint conditions ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is connected with the @xmath59-dependence of `` perturbation '' ( band energy @xmath6 ) , which changes its sign in the band , and a complicated structure of the green s fucntion ( the simple dyson equation is not valid ) . by these reasons , </S>",
    "<S> the signs of the corresponding imaginary parts are not fixed ; the problems increase when using self - consistent procedures . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , such a difficulty should occur in the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) for the anderson model where an expansion in the hybridization @xmath72 is constructed . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , this problem is usually misregarded since the normalization condition is practically never verified .    the approximation ( [ eq : egf ] ) , ( [ eq : a ] ) , ( [ eq : b ] ) has an unpleasant physical drawback : dos has the `` van hove '' singularities at the energies , corresponding to the edges of the hubbard - i band @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to remove this drawback , we renormalize self - consistently the bandwidths in the resolvents ( i.e. , in the denominators in ( [ eq : a : k ] ) , ( [ eq : b : k ] ) ) and in the fermi functions by replacing @xmath73 due to this self - consistency procedure , the band edges in the resolvents coincide with those for the total green s function ( [ eq : egf ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding numerical results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2].the analytical properties for @xmath69 are not violated ( table [ tab:1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is in spirit of large-@xmath74 expansion and retains the quasiparticle picture , unlike the hubbard - iii aproximation and the self - consistent approximation considered below which yield a strongly incoherent behavior .    finally , we discuss also the `` true '' self - consistent approximation where the exact green s functions are included into resolvents </S>",
    "<S> . then we have to replace in the denominators of ( [ eq : a : k ] ) , ( [ eq : b : k ] ) @xmath75 and to make the corresponding renormalization of the distribution functions @xmath76 one can see that the dos picture ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] ) becomes somewhat smeared even in the absence of spin dynamics , but the smearing is not so strong as in the fm case @xcite . in this self - consistent approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the analytical properties are violated for both @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( table  [ tab:1 ] ) .    to conclude , we have analyzed formation of the `` kondo '' peak in narrow - band systems at the fermi level within a simple analytical approach . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results demonstrate sharp energy dependence of the density of states near @xmath77 . as well as in the standard kondo problem </S>",
    "<S> , one can expect strong temperature dependences of thermodynamic and transport properties ( e.g. , an enhancement of the effective electron mass ) . </S>",
    "<S> this problem needs further investigations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , summation of higher - order perturbation corrections with the use of slave boson and fermion representations would be of interest .    </S>",
