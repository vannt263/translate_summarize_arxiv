    "thanks to the use of the uhao adaptive optics system ( roddier et al .",
    "@xcite ) , high resolution ground - based images were obtained ( @xmath10.15 in august 1995 and @xmath10.25 in november 1995 ) . the sun s crossing lasted from november 17@xmath2 to 21@xmath3 1995 .",
    "it was accompanied by three earth ring plane crossings ( 1995 may 22@xmath4 , august 10@xmath2 , and 1996 february 11@xmath2 ) .",

    "@xcite ) . + the unusual viewing of the rings during these events provides a rare opportunity to detect faint structures such as small satellites , clumps , or arcs , that are usually lost in the glare of the bright main rings . in this paper , we focus our attention on the azimuthal structure of the f ring .",
    "located at the roche limit of saturn and bounded by two shepherding satellites pandora and prometheus , the f ring is very intriguing .",
    "the voyager images revealed its complex radial and azimuthal structure including multiple strands , clumps and braids .",
    "interactions with saturn s satellites might explain some features , but they are not completely understood .",
    "+ during the 1995 ring crossing observing campaign , the f ring appeared populated with numerous features , either point - like or longitudinally extended .",
    "the observation of two point - like objects ( s/1995 s1 and s/1995 s3 ) was reported by bosh & rivkin ( @xcite ) during the may crossing . during the august crossing",
    ", our team discovered at least 6 new features with semi - major axes compatible with the f ring ( roddier et al .",
    "@xcite ; ferrari et al .",
    "at least one of them was identified as an arc - like object . during the same period",
    "three objects ( s/1995 s5 , s/19995 s6 and s/1995 s7 ) were detected by n96 . finally , during the november crossing , two wide arcs ( @xmath5 and 10-long ) were observed by n96 .",
    "the brightest was also seen by poulet et al .",
    "( @xcite , hereafter p2000 ) .",
    "the most striking aspect of those discoveries is that no evident correlation can be found between features observed in may , august and november ( n96 , bosh & rivkin 1996 , p2000 ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report the detection of 4 arcs in the region of the f ring on november 20@xmath2 .",
    "the same features can be seen in some hst images taken 24 to 36 hours later .",
    "these images have been already presented in n96 . by combining both sets of data ,",
    "accurate orbital solutions are derived .",
    "the data processing of cfht and hst images is presented in the first section .",
    "results are presented in the second section and discussed in the final section .",
    "images were taken at the 3.6 m cfh telescope during four nights from 1995 november 17@xmath2 to 20@xmath2 .",
    "three near - infrared filters ( j , h and k ) , which correspond to the absorption bands of methane were used to significantly reduce the strong scattered light of saturn .",
    "a k band image is presented in fig  [ fig.1 ] .",
    "the best observing conditions were obtained during the last night , the main rings being darkest . during the nights of november 17@xmath2,18@xmath219@xmath2",
    "the stronger brightness of the main rings was not favorable for the detection of dim objects .",
    "consequently only images of november 20@xmath2 were considered .    at this time the sun was about 0.01 below the rings , and",
    "the earth was at 2.67above the ring plane , looking at the unlit face .",
    "160 images of the west ansa were obtained from 5h to 8h45 ut . at this time",
    ", there was no satellite on the east ansa bright enough for the adaptive optics tracking system to work properly . in consequence ,",
    "the cfht data set contains only images of the west ansa .",
    "the resolution has been checked on every image by extracting the point spread function ( psf ) of satellites tethys , enceladus , dione and mimas . the full width at half maximum of the psf is on average 0.25 ( 1670 km at saturn ) on the whole data set , ranging from 0.19to 0.33 .",
    "the size of one pixel in arcsecond is determined by comparing the angular separation of all pair of major satellites ( given by the ephemeris ) with their separation in pixels as measured on the plates .",
    "the result is robust : one pixel subtends 0.035 ( @xmath1 233 km at saturn ) .",
    "the exposure times ranged from 15 s to 30 s. + in order to make a comparative study of two complementary data sets , we have also used the hst images presented in n96 , retrieved from the ftp site of the space telescope science institute .",
    "they consist of twenty planetary camera images of both ansae ( 10 images for each ansa ) , taken with filters centered at 890 nm , between 10h ut and 18h ut on november 21@xmath3 , at the end of the sun s crossing .",
    "the resolution is 0.1(668 km at saturn ) .",
    "the scale of the plates is taken from holtzman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) : one pixel subtends 0.045 ( @xmath1304 km at saturn ) .",
    "exposure times range from 300s to 500s . as a consequence",
    ", satellites appear smeared due to their keplerian motion .",
    "our data processing has been designed for the detection of faint objects in the f ring . as a consequence",
    "we have not made a photometric study ; indeed many images with different exposure times and different filters are combined indiscriminately .",
    "a longitudinal profile of the f ring was built to reveal new objects . to this purpose",
    "the following data processing steps were applied to both cfht and hst images : ( i)astrometry , ( ii)extraction of the f ring profiles , ( iii ) subtraction of the f ring background and the correction of geometry and illumination effects .      in cfht images , the center of saturn and orientation of the planet s north pole axis",
    "is determined by a least square fit to the positions of satellites tethys , enceladus , mimas and dione ( using the ephemeris of the bureau des longitudes in paris ) .",
    "however mimas and tethys could not be used in one third of images in which they are observed too close to each other , not suitable for an accurate determination of their center . in these images",
    "the point of maximum elongation of the cassini division and of the f ring were used to better constrain the orientation of saturn s equatorial axis .",
    "the residual on satellites position measurements is 0.09 ( @xmath12.6 pixels or 600 km ) , and reflects a combination of pointing and ephemeris errors .",
    "+ in hst images , the astrometry has not been done using satellites because of their elongated appearance .",
    "the sharp inner edge of the cassini division was used instead as a reference .",
    "located at 117577 km from the center of saturn , it is known to be slightly eccentric due to the close 2:1 resonance with mimas .",
    "the resulting radial excursion ( 2ae ) is only 150 km , representing 0.5 pixel , or 0.02 ( porco et al .",
    "the center of saturn as well as the orientation of the axes are determined by fitting an ellipse with twenty points picked by eye on the reference edge .",
    "corrections of the geometrical distortion for wf / pc2 camera ( wf / pc2 instrument handbook version 5.0 , provided by the stsci ) is included only when new objects are measured , for the need of their orbit determination .",
    "the astrometric error is determined from the residuals of the cassini division fit .",
    "it is 0.035(@xmath10.8 pixel or 240 km at saturn ) .",
    "the correction for geometrical distortion is about 1 pixel , representing less than @xmath6 on the f ring longitudinal profile , not detectable in fig  [ fig.2 ] and fig  [ fig.3 ] .      from -55 to + 55 around maximum elongation ,",
    "pixel counts are summed perpendicularly to the equator axis , in a box centered on the f ring ( defined as a circle of radius 140200 km and projected onto the ring plane ) with the same width as the psf . for each image , an intensity profile of the f ring",
    "is obtained as a function of longitude , measured from the point of maximum elongation . the extremity of the ansa ( within 5 pixels around maximum elongation ) is not considered because the scans become parallel to the ring in this region .",
    "the scattered light of saturn is estimated in the neighborhood of the integration box , outside the f ring , and systematically subtracted .",
    "profiles are then corrected for effects of the different filters and for different exposure times : each profile is multiplied by a normalization factor in order to keep at the same median level of brightness a reference zone of the f ring , chosen to be between 0 and 45 before maximum elongation .",
    "because of the low opening angle of the rings system , the reference zone is slightly contaminated by the a ring beyond 25  from maximum elongation .",
    "however we have checked that all profiles do not present systematic deviations in the reference zone after this operation .",
    "a synthetic median profile ( smp ) of the f ring is built by taking the median value of all profiles at each longitude relative to elongation .",
    "the smp is a template of the f ring .",
    "it is subtracted from all profiles in order to reveal local brightness variations .",
    "+ the apparent brightness of the f ring changes along its path around the ansa due to geometrical effects ( the length of a ring segment included in one pixel depends on longitude ) and probably to shadowing by the a ring ( n96 ) .",
    "indeed the f ring brightness decreases abruptly after maximum elongation on the west ansa , as noticed in n96 . to correct for these effects and maintain embedded features at a constant level of brightness ,",
    "all profiles are divided by the smp .",
    "taking into account the subtraction of the f ring background , all profiles are processed according to the formula : final profile @xmath7 .",
    "dividing by the smp increases noise in dim regions .",
    "this method preserves the brightness of objects within 20% before and after their passage through the maximum elongation ( as observed on arcs b , c and on the 10  arc of n96 , see below ) and allows tracking of objects .",
    "each ( final ) profile is precessed to the standard epoch of november 21.5 tdt ( terrestrial dynamic time ) at saturn , with a mean orbital motion of @xmath8/day ( n96 ) .",
    "this allows direct comparison with n96 results .",
    "finally a mean longitudinal profile is computed by averaging all precessed profiles .",
    "+ the resulting cfht and hst profiles are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] . the derived hst full azimuthal profile ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.2].c ) is in close agreement with the one published in n96 , in terms of the positions of objects and relative brightnesses , although our profile may appear somewhat noisier than the one published in n96 . in this profile ,",
    "the correction for the distortion of the wf / pc2 camera has not been considered , resulting in an azimuthal error less than @xmath10.6 .",
    "the vertical axis is scaled such that the maximum intensity of pandora , as observed in the processed profiles , equals 1 .",
    "in this section the f ring azimuthal profile obtained from cfht observations is described and compared with the hst profile .",
    "orbital solutions for four detected structures are then calculated .        the complete azimuthal coverage of the data set ranges between 50 to 230 .",
    "but the region extending from 50 to 80has been covered by only a few suitable images ( @xmath110 ) and is deeply embedded in the very strong scattered light of saturn s globe . apart from pandora appearing at 62",
    ", nothing is detected below 80 .",
    "janus contaminates cfht profiles around 210 longitude .",
    "the region of interest then extends between 80 and 200  ( fig  [ fig.2].a ) . in this range ,",
    "the average error bar ( @xmath9 ) is about 4% of pandora s brightness . +",
    "two structures ( b and c ) are detected with more than @xmath10 confidence level , with mean central longitudes of 135and 177respectively .",
    "the b object is the `` 7  arc '' in n96 .",
    "their maximum brightness is 30% to 40% of pandora s . compared to the @xmath11-azimuthal extension of a point - like source due to the psf ( as observed for pandora ) , it is clear that b and c are azimuthally extended objects .",
    "the b object has a fwhm of @xmath1 7 .",
    "it is observed before ( from 5h10 to 6h30 ut ) and after its passage through maximum elongation ( from 7h40 to 8h45 ut ) .",
    "feature c has a fwhm of 10 .",
    "it is detected during 20 minutes before maximum elongation ( from 5h10 to 5h30 ) and during 80 mn after maximum elongation ( from 5h50 to 7h10 ut ) .",
    "a few other bumps also seem to appear with lower confidence level ( @xmath12 - 3@xmath12 ) below 120  and at 124 , 163and 190 . only two of them may be tracked on many images with a keplerian motion .",
    "the a object , located at 124 , is nearly marginal here and seems to extend from 117to 129and has an intensity about 15% of pandora s .",
    "it is detected from 5h50 to 6h40 ut ( @xmath1 30 images ) .",
    "the d object ( located at 190 ) may be followed from 5h40 to 6h20 ut .",
    "its azimuthal shape is uncertain because of numerous nearby artifacts on the images where it is detected .",
    "comparison of cfht and hst profiles indicates that at least structures b and c lasted over a 24 to 36 hours time interval .",
    "indeed both profiles are in good agreement within @xmath9 ( see fig .  [ fig.2].a and fig .  [ fig.2].b ) . because of the small number of images , the noise varies significantly with longitude in the hst profile , depending on the number of images covering each region .",
    "it is on average @xmath1 6% of pandora s brightness .",
    "the azimuthal extension of a point - like object is also 3(measured on pandora and prometheus ) , but here it is mainly due to smearing .",
    "objects b and c are present in both profiles . the shape and position of object b fits particularly well .",
    "c appears slightly narrower in the hst profile , but both are compatible within @xmath9 in intensity .",
    "its fwhm is about 9 in the hst profile . + a better signal to noise ratio",
    "is simply obtained by averaging cfht and hst profiles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] ) .",
    "the new error bar at @xmath9 is @xmath13of pandora s brightness , which improves by factors 1.2 and 1.8 upon the signal to noise ratio of cfht and hst profiles respectively . in the averaged profile the confidence level of objects b and c increases to @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "objects a and d , that were marginal in the cfht profile , appear now at @xmath16 and @xmath10 respectively , showing these are real structures . whereas the shape of a is in good agreement between cfht and hst profiles , the shape of d is more peaked in the hst profile , and is centered at 192 .",
    "features below 120and at 164are comparable to the error bar in the averaged profile .",

    "the evolution of the f ring may critically depend on its two shepherding satellites , pandora and prometheus ( see for example : dermott @xcite ; showalter & burns @xcite ; lissauer & peale @xcite ) . during the 1995 crossings",
    ", prometheus was lagging its expected position by @xmath1 19 ( n96 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that an encounter of the f ring with prometheus may have happened in between 1991 and 1994 ( murray & giuliatti winter @xcite ) due to the precessional variation of the orbits owing to saturn s oblateness .",
    "the dynamical consequence of this encounter on the structure of the f ring is not currently known .",
    "it might result in breaking of the strands and in the creation of structures in the inner regions of the f ring .",
    "indeed a massive body is able to scatter its environment inside three hill s radii ( nishida @xcite ; ida & makino @xcite ) that is about 300 km for prometheus ( assuming a mass ratio of @xmath31 between prometheus and saturn ) . then in case of an instantaneous close approach to the f ring , estimated at @xmath32 km ( murray & giuliatti winter @xcite ) , prometheus might be able to perturb the ring over a distance of 300 km , i.e. about the full width of the f ring .",
    "such a model has been recently considered ( abstract of showalter et al .",
    "@xcite ; p.d .",
    "nicholson , private communicaton ) , and first results show that prometheus may perturb a portion of the f ring after each close encounter .",
    "however the resulting radial displacement seems to be about 1 kilometer only .",
    "+ in addition , during the interaction , prometheus at its apocenter is close to the f ring s pericenter , yielding strong relative velocities of @xmath1 30 m / s . such high - velocity encounters may result in catastrophic disruption of bodies initially in the f ring .",
    "the inner region of the f ring may be consequently populated with fragments especially if a belt of kilometer - sized moonlets exists between prometheus and pandora , as originally suggested by cuzzi & burns ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have reported observations of the crossing of saturn s ring - plane by the sun , on 1995 november 20@xmath2 , made with the 3.6 m cfh telescope , using the uhao adaptive optics system .",
    "four azimuthally extended structures ( a , b , c , d ) have been detected , with central longitude at epoch of 123 , 136 , 177 and 193  ( see table  [ table2 ] ) , on 1995 november 21.5 tdt at saturn .",
    "these structures have been also seen one day later in hst images ( n96 ) .",
    "the combination of both cfht and hst data sets provides an accurate estimate of their orbit .",
    "a circular orbital fit locates them between 140020 km and 140080 km , with error bars of 120 km on average .",
    "the mean circular orbit is 140060 @xmath18 60 km , that is consistent with the orbit of another bright arc observed at the same epoch ( p2000 ) .",
    "however , this represents a significant discrepancy ( @xmath33 ) with previous estimates of the f ring s radius derived from voyager images ( located at @xmath34 km on average ) .",
    "if the five arcs observed in november 1995 belong to a f ring core , this would imply a radial restructuring or a spreading of the f ring between 1980 and 1995 , whose explanation has still to be found . in order to understand the f ring s dynamics ,",
    "better spatial resolution and longer time baselines observations are required .",
    "the cassini encounter in 2004 will probably be a major step in the understanding of the f ring mysteries ."
