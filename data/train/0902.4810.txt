    "<S> furthermore , the case @xmath25 is considered . in the chosen metric gauge , </S>",
    "<S> the squared riemann tensor is given by : @xmath26 the main difficulty in solving the system numerically is the fact that the metric function @xmath11 has a coordinate singularity at the event horizon , making the numerical calculation `` through '' the horizon intricate . </S>",
    "<S> this is why the computation process was divided into two parts . </S>",
    "<S> first , the gm - ghs solution ( [ eq:08 ] ) was taken as the initial condition at infinity . </S>",
    "<S> solutions for the metric functions and the dilaton outside the event horizon were found . </S>",
    "<S> then , the results near the horizon were taken as new initial conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of metric the functions @xmath11 and @xmath13 , together with the dilaton exponent @xmath27 , were investigated under the event horizon of the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> it differs significantly depending on the black hole charge . if the charge is zero or small the metric function @xmath11 is defined only for @xmath28 ( @xmath29 being smaller than the event horizon radius @xmath30 ) . in this case , there exist two mathematical branches : one is physical ( and displayed on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f:01 ] ) , ranging from @xmath7 to infinity , and the other one is an artifact , ranging from @xmath7 to @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> if the value of the charge is larger than a critical value @xmath31 , the inner singularity does not exist anymore and , as it can be seen on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f:01 ] ( right ) , @xmath11 exhibits a local minimum . </S>",
    "<S> when the black hole charge increases from zero , a phase transition occurs at @xmath32 such that the inner singularity disappears ( being relpaced by a local minimum for @xmath11 ) and an inner horizon forms at @xmath33 . </S>",

    "<S> the situation when the black hole charge reaches its critical value and the metric function @xmath11 begins to exhibit a local minimum instead of a singularity at @xmath38 was considered in more details . </S>",
    "<S> it was checked that in this case the value of the curvature invariant does not diverge anymore . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore obvious that the local minimum of the metric function @xmath49 is intrinsically non singular .    when @xmath39 ( _ i.e. _ when the @xmath29 singularity vanishes ) , the important point is @xmath33 , where @xmath13 vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> it was numerically checked that the curvature invariant diverges at this point . </S>",
    "<S> so , it can be conjectured that @xmath50 becomes a singular horizon inside the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath37 , this horizon belongs to the nonphysical branch of the considered system of equations . </S>",
    "<S> near the singular horizon @xmath33 ( when @xmath51 ) , the curvature invariant diverges significantly more rapidly than near the singularity @xmath29 ( when @xmath37 ) .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f:04 ] , the curvature invariant is shown as a function the the metric function @xmath13 which , in the chosen metric , has the intuitive meaning of the radius of a two - sphere . in the same plot the asymptotic dependence of the curvature invariant from the radial </S>",
    "<S> coordinate @xmath14 in the neibourhood of the discussed particular points is written down . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic behavior of the metric function @xmath13 in those regions can be expressed as follows @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the numerical expansion coefficients .    </S>",
    "<S> so the divergence of the curvature invariant in terms of metric function @xmath13 is given by @xmath54    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f:05 ] , the three - dimensional dependance of the curvature invariant as a function of the charge @xmath45 and the radial coordinate @xmath14 are displayed . + </S>",
    "<S> this establishes the internal structure of a maxwell - gauss - bonnet black holes . </S>",
    "<S> it can also be noticed that the regularization of the internal structure , which is expected by some models of `` cosmological natural selection '' @xcite and is predicted by loop quantum gravity @xcite , does not happen in gauss - bonnet gravity , even for highly charged black holes . </S>"
