    "nuclear water vapor megamasers currently provide the only direct means to map gas in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) on size scales of @xmath20.11  pc .",
    "nearly all of the observational work on h@xmath3o megamasers to date has focused on the @xmath4 rotational transition at 22.235 ghz from the ortho - h@xmath3o molecule .",
    "more than 160 galaxies have been detected in this line so far , the result of some @xmath24000 galaxies surveyed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "about 130 of the detections are associated with agn , where they are called megamasers because of their large apparent luminosities .",
    "the physical conditions that give rise to maser activity at 22 ghz are also compatible with masing in other transitions of the h@xmath3o molecule , many of which fall in the submillimeter wavelength band ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite presented the first observations of h@xmath3o megamaser emission in a transition other than the 22 ghz , detecting maser emission at 183 ghz and ( tentatively ) at 439 ghz towards the galaxy ngc 3079 .",
    "this galaxy had previously been known to host strong 22 ghz masers , with vlbi observations confirming that the 22 ghz emission originates from the galactic nucleus ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "though the signal - to - noise of the ( sub)millimeter detections ( @xmath27@xmath5 for the 183 ghz transition ) was too low to permit detailed study , the maser emission appears to arise from several narrow ( spectrally unresolved ) features spanning a velocity range comparable to that of the 22 ghz emission .    the 183 ghz transition was also detected towards arp 220 by @xcite , where it displays a very broad ( @xmath2350  km  s@xmath6 ) and almost featureless spectral line structure .",
    "interestingly , this galaxy has not been detected in 22 ghz emission ( e.g. , ) , suggesting that the masing gas has a low density ( @xmath7  @xmath8 ) and temperature ( @xmath9  k ) . from consideration of these physical conditions and the observed line width ,",
    "@xcite interpret the 183 ghz masers in this galaxy as likely originating from a large number ( @xmath210@xmath10 ) of dense molecular cores rather than being associated with the galactic nuclei .",
    "more recently , @xcite used alma to detect 321 ghz h@xmath3o megamaser emission towards the circinus galaxy , another strong 22 ghz nuclear megamaser host ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the circinus observation was sufficient to showcase the richness of the high - frequency maser spectrum , opening up for the first time the possibility of using submillimeter masers in ways that had heretofore been restricted to the 22 ghz transition .    in this paper",
    "we report the first detection of submillimeter maser emission from ngc 4945 , and we present a new calibration of the maser spectrum for the circinus galaxy .",
    "we note that @xcite offer a parallel analysis of the ngc 4945 data presented here .",
    "the observations and data reduction procedures are described in  [ observationsandreduction ] , and in  [ discussion ] we discuss the submillimeter emission and compare the 321 ghz masers to those at 22 ghz . throughout this paper",
    "we quote velocities using the optical definition in the heliocentric reference frame .",
    "we have analyzed archival cycle 0 alma observations of five galaxies that are known to have strong ( peak @xmath11  mjy ) 22 ghz water maser emission associated with a central agn : ngc 1068 @xcite , ngc 1386 @xcite , ngc 4945 @xcite , circinus @xcite , and ngc 5793 @xcite .",
    "all targets were observed at a rest - frame frequency of 321.226 ghz ( alma band 7 ) , which corresponds to the @xmath12 rotational transition of ortho - h@xmath3o at an energy of @xmath13  k above ground .",
    "ngc 5793 was further observed at a rest - frame frequency of 325.153 ghz , corresponding to the @xmath14 rotational transition of para - h@xmath3o at an energy of @xmath15  k above ground .",
    "the total bandwidth for each dual - polarization observation was 1.875  ghz , which was split into 3840 channels spaced contiguously every 0.488  mhz ( corresponding to a velocity resolution of @xmath20.5  km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "the longest baselines for these observations were @xmath2360 meters ( corresponding to a typical resolution of @xmath2@xmath16 ) , and there were between 18 and 25 antennas present ( see table [ tab : info ] ) .",

    "+      initial imaging was performed using casa task ` clean ` with natural uv weighting ; after using ` uvcontsub ` ( specifying line - free channels ) to remove the continuum contribution , we separately imaged the line and continuum emission .",

    "we found that a solution interval of 1 minute ( averaging both polarizations ) was optimal , yielding sufficiently continuous solutions ( i.e. , consecutive phase solution jumps of @xmath32 ) to confidently interpolate the phases .",

    "the resulting continuum image is shown in figure [ fig : continuum_contours ] , and the spectrum extracted from the ( spatially unresolved ) line - only data cube is shown in figure [ fig : circinus_321ghz_spectra ] .",
    "the maser emission in ngc 4945 is not sufficiently strong for self - calibration , so we used the continuum emission instead .",
    "because the continuum emission in ngc 4945 is spatially resolved , we only used the longest baselines ( @xmath33  m , corresponding to the unresolved , point - like nuclear component of the emission ) to determine the phase solutions that were then applied to the spectral line data ; no such baseline restrictions were imposed when self - calibrating the continuum image itself .",

    "the resulting noise level of @xmath34  mjy  beam@xmath6 is thus larger than what one would nominally expect from a sensitivity calculation .",
    "the rest of the reduction procedure matches what was done for circinus ( see  [ circinusreduction ] ) . to account for the sizable ( @xmath2@xmath35 ) offset of the emission center from the phase center",
    ", we used ` impbcor ` to apply a primary beam correction prior to extracting a spectrum from the data cube .",
    "the continuum image and spectrum for ngc 4945 are shown in figures [ fig : continuum_contours ] and [ fig : ngc4945_321ghz_spectra ] , respectively .",
    "the continuum structures for ngc 5793 and ngc 4945 are both elongated in one direction ( spanning @xmath24@xmath36  pc in ngc 5793 , and @xmath29@xmath37  pc in ngc 4945 ) , and both appear to have substantial substructure .",
    "both of these galaxies are edge - on spirals , and the elongation axes of the submillimeter continua are aligned with the large - scale optical major axes ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the continuum in ngc 4945",
    "is also resolved along the minor axis , spanning @xmath21.5@xmath38  pc .",
    "all of this indicates that the continuum emission in these galaxies traces the galactic disks , rather than originating from , e.g. , a molecular torus region around the central agn ( though there may be a contribution to the emission in the centermost regions from such material ) .    at these wavelengths",
    "( @xmath39  @xmath40 m ) , the continuum in ngc 5793 and ngc 4945 is likely dominated by optically thin thermal ( i.e. blackbody ) emission from large dust grains ( see , e.g. , ; ) .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of such emission is typically modeled as a modified blackbody function ( e.g. , ) , with the free parameters being the optical depth @xmath41 , the dust temperature @xmath42 , and the power - law index of the dust opacity @xmath43 . with only a single sed point per galaxy",
    ", we must assume fiducial values for two of these parameters ( e.g. , @xmath43 and @xmath42 ) to allow for a measurement of the third ( e.g. , @xmath41 ) .",
    "further assumptions are then necessary to convert the optical depth to , e.g. , a total interstellar medium ( ism ) gas mass , @xmath44 .    fortunately , @xcite have developed an empirical calibration of the relationship between dust emission and ism gas mass .",
    "as long as the emission is measured in the rayleigh - jeans tail , the authors found that the calibration is relatively insensitive to whether the ism is dominated by atomic or molecular gas , if the galaxy is normal or undergoing a starburst , or whether the dust lies in the inner or outer regions of the galaxy .",
    "rewritten in a suitable form , the conversion is given by    @xmath45    here , @xmath46 is the luminosity distance to the galaxy , @xmath47 is the observing wavelength , @xmath48 is the observed flux density , @xmath49 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath50 is the dust opacity per unit mass of ism , and @xmath42 is the dust temperature .",
    "most of the underlying physics here is contained in @xmath50 , which the authors calibrated using _ planck _ data to be    @xmath51    when calculating gas masses , we use the results from to fix @xmath52 , and we adopt a dust temperature of @xmath53  k ( following @xcite ) .",
    "we measure the total continuum flux density for each galaxy using a circular aperture centered on the continuum peak , and we estimate the uncertainty using the dispersion of integrated flux densities measured in 15 non - overlapping , identical apertures that are offset from the continuum emission in the same image .",
    "the results from these measurements are presented in the bottom portion of table [ tab : info ] .",
    "the gas masses estimated from the 321  ghz and 325  ghz observations of ngc 5793 are broadly consistent , while the estimate for ngc 4945 is somewhat lower .",
    "ngc 1068 , ngc 1386 , and circinus all show continuum emission considerably more centrally - concentrated than in ngc 5793 and ngc 4945 , so it is likely that agn contributions to the continua for these galaxies are not negligible . disentangling the thermal ( i.e. , blackbody ) and nonthermal ( e.g. , electron - scattered synchrotron , free - free ) components of the emission is nontrivial , and requires multi - frequency observations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    for ngc 1068",
    ", we can compare our observations to those of , who used alma to map the continuum at 349  ghz down to a @xmath54 level of @xmath55  mjy  beam@xmath6 .",
    "though this is a factor of @xmath23 more sensitive than the map presented in this paper , we see consistent continuum structure and amplitude in the circumnuclear region ( i.e. , the region containing emission stronger than our sensitivity threshold ) between the two observations .",
    "the 321 ghz maser detection in ngc 4945  which represents the first time such emission has been seen in this galaxy  is considerably fainter than in circinus ( figure [ fig : ngc4945_321ghz_spectra ] ) .",
    "individual maser features are detected at the @xmath245@xmath5 level , though the entire complex between 650 km  s@xmath6 and 750 km  s@xmath6 is detected at @xmath2@xmath56 in integrated intensity .",
    "we have calculated an isotropic luminosity using    @xmath57    here , @xmath46 is the distance to the galaxy , @xmath58 is the line rest frequency , and @xmath59 is the flux density as a function of velocity @xmath60 .",
    "scaled to convenient units , this equation becomes    @xmath61    adopting a distance to ngc 4945 of 3.7 mpc @xcite , the observed flux of @xmath62 jy  km  s@xmath6 corresponds to an isotropic luminosity of @xmath63 l@xmath64 .",
    "though the flux density of individual features is down by a factor of @xmath2100 from what is observed at 22 ghz ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the isotropic luminosity is only lower by a factor of @xmath210 .",
    "insofar as we are able to discern spectral structure , we see that it appears to match reasonably well with previous observations of ngc 4945 at 22 ghz ( top panel of figure [ fig : ngc4945_321ghz_spectra ] has been reproduced from @xcite ) .",
    "the increasing feature strength with increasing velocity and the overall appearance of 23 dominant features are both reminiscent of the 22 ghz spectra . however , the 321 ghz features at @xmath2687  km  s@xmath6 and @xmath2726  km  s@xmath6 ( with possibly a third at @xmath2660  km  s@xmath6 ) do nt map one - to - one with regions of 22 ghz emission . rather , and quite intriguingly , the 321 ghz peaks fall precisely where the 22 ghz emission drops off .",
    "unlike with circinus , the origin of the 22 ghz emission from ngc 4945 is not yet well understood .",
    "@xcite made a vlbi map of ngc 4945 at 22 ghz using the southernmost antennas of the vlba , and they found the spatial distribution of the masers to be approximately linear and distributed across @xmath250  mas ( @xmath20.9  pc ) from one end to the other .",
    "this  in particular the roughly symmetric location of redshifted and blueshifted emission to either side of the systemic velocity  is suggestive of masers situated in an accretion disk .",
    "the limited antennas available for mapping such a low declination source ( @xmath65 ) resulted in the map being rather incomplete ( i.e. , there were several systemic and blueshifted features that were too faint to map ) , but it is the best available for this source .",
    "when measuring the positions of the 321 ghz maser spots , we found them to be spatially coincident ( within the measurement uncertainties ) .",
    "if the intrinsic distribution of the 321 ghz masers matches that of the 22 ghz masers , this is consistent with what we would expect for the @xmath20.5@xmath66 beam and low signal - to - noise of the observations .",
    "working under the assumption that the 321 ghz emission traces material with the same kinematics as the 22 ghz , the observed 321 ghz features correspond only to the redshifted gas in the accretion disk .",
    "if the 321 ghz spectral structure follows that of the 22 ghz emission , then the undetected blue and systemic features would be slightly below our detection threshold .",
    "the low signal - to - noise in the current observations precludes any detailed characterization of this system , which must await higher sensitivity , better angular resolution observations than those presented here .",
    "@xcite discovered the 321 ghz maser in circinus .",
    "here we re - examine the data , using strong maser lines to apply phase self - calibration ( see  [ circinusreduction ] ) .",
    "the new calibration improves the snr by a factor of @xmath22 compared the initial analysis",
    ".    published 22 ghz spectra of circinus ( e.g. , top panel of figure [ fig : circinus_321ghz_spectra ] , reproduced from @xcite ) show that the bulk of the maser emission occupies velocities between @xmath2250650 km  s@xmath6 more or less contiguously , though often with a notable paucity of features near the systemic velocity .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter g03 ) observed circinus between 1997 and 1998 using the australia telescope long baseline array .",
    "they detected two populations of masers , one arising from a warped accretion disk and the other associated with a wide - angle , bipolar outflow .",
    "the 321 ghz masers are weaker in flux density by a factor of @xmath230100 compared to their 22 ghz counterparts .",
    "although the maser flux at 22 ghz is subject to interstellar scintillation @xcite , this effect should be almost completely absent at 321 ghz ( at such a high frequency , the diffractive scale of the turbulence will be much larger than the fresnel scale ; see @xcite ) . at a distance to the galaxy of 4.2  mpc ( measured by @xcite using the tully - fisher relation )",
    ", the observed flux of @xmath67  jy  km  s@xmath6 corresponds to an isotropic luminosity ( via equation [ eqn : isotropicluminosity ] ) of @xmath2104  l@xmath64 ; this is roughly a factor of four larger than the isotropic luminosity of the 22 ghz masers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the 321 ghz and 22 ghz spectra share broad structural similarities .",
    "both have maser emission spanning comparable total velocity ranges and consolidated primarily into two groups located on either side of the systemic velocity , and in both cases the blueshifted group of features is weaker and sparser than the redshifted group .",
    "we can also see that the region around the systemic velocity in the 321 ghz spectrum is devoid of obvious features  either because no maser features exist at these velocities , or because they are below our detection threshold  which is reminiscent of the same segment of the 22 ghz spectrum .",
    "the vlbi maps from g03 show that the extent of the 22 ghz maser emission in circinus is roughly @xmath68  mas ( @xmath2@xmath69  pc ) , but as with ngc 4945 the 321 ghz maser spots are spatially co - located within our measurement uncertainties .",
    "though the absolute astrometric precision for alma observations is typically limited to @xmath20.05 arcseconds without taking special calibration steps ( @xcite ; ) , the relative uncertainty in point - source position within the same primary beam ( as a fraction of the half - power beam width ) is inversely proportional to the snr ( see , e.g. , ) .",
    "future high - resolution alma observations should thus have little difficulty mapping the 321 ghz masers in circinus .    in lieu of a high angular resolution map",
    ", we can use the information contained in the spectrum to glean some understanding of the spatial distribution of the masers . by applying a threshold proximity of 1 mas between any individual maser spot and the disk midline , g03",
    "were able to assign a rough classification to each maser as originating from either the disk or the outflow .",
    "in doing so , they found that the outflow masers dominated the emission between @xmath2300600 km  s@xmath6 , and that disk maser emission dominated blueward of @xmath2300  km  s@xmath6 and redward of @xmath2600  km  s@xmath6 ( see figure 6 in their paper ) . with this picture from g03 as a guideline , we can compare the spectral distribution of the 22 ghz masers to that of the 321 ghz masers .",
    "their similar overall spectral structure suggests that the 321 ghz and 22 ghz masers are tracing roughly the same material .",
    "this is to be expected from consideration of the physical conditions required for strong maser activity in these transitions . @xcite",
    "have performed a thorough exploration of the relevant parameter space ( i.e. , gas density , kinetic temperature , and dust temperature ) and found that the 321 ghz transition shares an optimal gas density ( @xmath70 @xmath8 ) and collisional pumping scheme ( i.e. , low dust temperature ) with the 22 ghz transition , though it prefers a somewhat larger kinetic temperature of @xmath71 k ( compared to @xmath72 k for the 22 ghz transition ) .",
    "this could explain the apparent excess of 321 ghz maser emission between @xmath2650750 km  s@xmath6 , which is not typically seen in 22 ghz spectra ( though we note that 22 ghz emission has been seen out to velocities as large as @xmath2900 km  s@xmath6 , albeit with a much lower flux density than the bulk of the emission ; see @xcite ) . under this interpretation",
    ", the 321 ghz emission redward of 650 km  s@xmath6 originates in the accretion disk at radii interior to where 22 ghz emission is found .",
    "we see no features in the 321 ghz spectrum between @xmath2300500 km  s@xmath6 , which is a spectral range dominated by outflow emission at 22 ghz .",
    "either the 321 ghz emission does not trace the outflow at all or the 321 ghz outflow masers in this velocity range are much fainter than their 22 ghz counterparts ( i.e. , down by a larger factor from the higher - velocity emission to either side ) . if the 321 ghz masers in fact only trace the disk emission , then the features detected between @xmath2500600 km  s@xmath6 indicate that some of these masers must originate farther out in the disk than the 22 ghz masers .",
    "higher angular resolution observations will be able to discern whether any of the 321 ghz maser originate in the outflow or if they are all associated with the disk .",
    "the possible high - velocity maser features  seen at @xmath21070  km  s@xmath6 and @xmath21130  km  s@xmath6 in the 321 ghz spectrum  coincide with an atmospheric line ( see figure [ fig : circinus_321ghz_spectra ] ) and may represent elevated noise .",
    "we present 321 ghz alma observations of ngc 5793 , ngc 1068 , ngc 1386 , ngc 4945 , and the circinus galaxy .",
    "all galaxies are detected in continuum emission , and circinus and ngc 4945 also display h@xmath3o megamaser emission . for ngc 4945",
    "these data represent the first detection of submillimeter megamaser activity , while for circinus we confirm the results of @xcite , with an updated calibration . in both cases",
    "the 321 ghz spectra appear structurally comparable to those of the 22 ghz masers .",
    "the continuum emission in ngc 5793 and ngc 4945 is well - resolved and spatially extended along the optical major axes of these galaxies , which are both edge - on spirals .",
    "this continuum is likely dominated by thermal emission from dust grains in the disk , and we use the observed fluxes to derive approximate ism masses . for the other three galaxies ,",
    "the continuum emission is centrally - concentrated and thus likely contains a substantial non - thermal component from the agn .",
    "though the 22 ghz maser emission in circinus is associated with both the accretion disk and a molecular outflow , it is unclear whether the 321 ghz emission traces both environments or just the disk .",
    "furthermore , we have reason to believe that the 321 ghz masers trace the accretion disk at smaller radial separations from the central smbh than the mapped 22 ghz masers do .",
    "this can be confirmed by future alma observations of circinus , which should seek to obtain a map of the maser features at the highest possible angular resolution .",
