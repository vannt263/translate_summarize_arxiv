    "extracting the parameters , such as masses , widths , and form factors , associated with the @xmath6 and @xmath7 resonances ( collectively referred to as @xmath5 ) from the data of meson - production reactions is an important task for understanding quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the nonperturbative domain .",
    "it is usually done by performing a comprehensive partial - wave analysis of @xmath8 and @xmath9 reactions with various final states including @xmath8 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 etc . within the on - shell @xmath15-matrix approaches  @xcite and the dynamical - model approaches  @xcite . here , the unitarity is a key essential element in accomplishing such a comprehensive analysis and making a reliable extraction of resonance parameters , because it not only ensures the conservation of probability in multichannel reaction processes but also properly defines the analytic structure of the scattering amplitudes in the complex - energy plane .",
    "the latter is crucial for extracting from the data correctly the resonance parameters defined at the poles of scattering amplitudes .    among the @xmath5 resonance parameters , transition amplitudes for the photo- and electro - excitation of the nucleon to @xmath5 resonances , @xmath16 ,",
    "have been a particular focus of interest in the @xmath5 spectroscopy because of its crucial role in understanding the electromagnetic properties as well as the quark - gluon substructure of @xmath5 resonances ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "in fact , the dynamical - model studies  @xcite of photon- and electron - induced meson - production reactions off the proton target revealed the large meson - cloud effect on the transition amplitudes at low @xmath17 whereas it decreases when @xmath17 is increased , implying that the ( constituent ) quark - gluon core of @xmath5 surrounded by dense meson clouds at long distance scales gradually emerges at shorter distance scales . in this",
    "regard , new extensive measurements of @xmath18 with @xmath19 are planned at clas12  @xcite , aiming at precise determinations of the @xmath20 transition amplitudes in the @xmath17 region where such a transition to the `` core - dominated '' region is expected to occur .",
    "however , for the @xmath4 @xmath5 resonances , the @xmath16 transition amplitudes for both the proton ( @xmath21 ) and neutron ( @xmath22 ) are necessary to uniquely determine the isospin structure of the photo- and electro - excitation couplings .",
    "the information on such isospin - decomposed transition amplitudes are also important for investigating the neutrino - induced reactions in the @xmath5 resonance region ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) because those are the basic ingredients for constructing the vector - current matrix elements associated with the weak interactions .",
    "the analysis of the photo- and electro - production reactions on both the proton and neutron targets is required to determine the isospin structure of the @xmath16 transition amplitudes for the @xmath4 @xmath5 resonances @xmath5 resonances , the @xmath20 and @xmath23 transition amplitudes are the same , and thus in principle only the data for either the proton- or neutron - target reaction is required .",
    "however , it is still highly desirable to have the data for both reactions so that one can have more constraints on the transition amplitudes for @xmath24 @xmath5 resonances as well . ] , and such combined analyses have been done so far by several analysis groups  @xcite within the coupled - channels framework .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we reported on the @xmath5 parameters extracted within the dynamical coupled - channels ( dcc ) model developed in ref .",
    "our approach is to fit the meson production data and to also search for the resonance poles by solving the following coupled integral equations for the partial - wave amplitudes , @xmath25 , which are specified by the total angular momentum @xmath26 , parity @xmath27 , and total isospin @xmath28 ( these indices are suppressed in the following equations ) , @xmath29 with @xmath30 here , the subscripts @xmath31 represent reaction channels considered , for which the @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 channels are the resonant components of the three - body @xmath10 channel .",
    "[ indices for the orbital angular momentum ( @xmath35 ) and total spin ( @xmath36 ) of each reaction channel are suppressed . ]",
    "@xmath37 is the green s function of channel @xmath38 ; @xmath39 is the mass of the @xmath40th bare excited nucleon state @xmath41 in a given partial wave ; the hadron - exchange potential @xmath42 is derived from the effective lagrangians by making use of the unitary transformation method  @xcite ; the energy - dependent @xmath43 term  @xcite is the effective one - particle - exchange potential that is derived with the projection operator method  @xcite and produces the three - body @xmath44 cut ; the vertex interaction @xmath45 defines the @xmath46 decay ( note @xmath47 ) .",
    "similar approach is also taken in ref .",
    "the differences between our approach and the other coupled - channels analyses @xcite , which only consider the on - shell matrix elements of @xmath48 , have been discussed in detail in refs .",
    "here we only mention that these models can be qualitatively obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : teq ] ) by keeping only the on - shell part of the propagator @xmath49 , and refs .",
    "@xcite further replace the hadron - exchange interaction @xmath50 by phenomenological forms such as the polynomials of on - shell momenta . if the data are _ complete _ ( as explained , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the high accuracy fits can be achieved , all approaches are acceptable for extracting the resonance pole positions",
    ". however , more investigations are needed to examine under what ideal conditions all approaches should give the same resonance parameters defined at the poles of the scattering amplitudes .",
    "furthermore , it is practically impossible to get _ complete _ data .",
    "thus it is essential to impose theoretical constraints on both the determinations of the partial - wave amplitudes and the extractions of @xmath5 parameters .",
    "this is accomplished in our approach by implementing the well - established hadron - exchange mechanisms , as defined by @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : veq ] ) , in the fits .",
    "this also allows us to provide interpretations of the structure of the extracted @xmath5 resonances , such as the meson - cloud effects on the @xmath16 transitions .    for the calculations of the @xmath9 reaction amplitudes , we use the so - called helicity-@xmath51 mixed - representation  @xcite , in which the initial @xmath9 state is specified by their helicities , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , while the final meson - baryon state is specified by @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath26 and @xmath28 as in eq .",

    "we note that the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : teq2 ] ) runs over only hadronic meson - baryon channels .",
    "we take @xmath9 channel perturbatively since the electromagnetic interactions are much smaller than the strong ones and their effect on the resonance parameters are expected to be just the order of isospin breaking .",
    "the potential @xmath57 is again derived from the effective lagrangians by making use of the unitary transformation method . on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite the potential for electromagnetic interaction is simply parametrized with polynomials .    in our previous work",
    "performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we analyzed the available data of @xmath58 reactions in the region of @xmath59 2.1 gev .",
    "then 24 physical @xmath5 resonances , which are defined at the poles of the scattering amplitudes in the complex energy plane , were successfully extracted .",
    "their properties , including the @xmath2 transition amplitudes , were also extracted by evaluating the residues of the scattering amplitudes at the resonance poles .    as a first step towards understanding the isospin structure of the photo- and electro - excitation of the nucleon to the @xmath4 @xmath5 resonances , in this work we extend our previous dcc analysis  @xcite by further including the available data of @xmath0 photoproductions off the neutron and making a combined analysis of meson production reactions off the proton and neutron targets .",
    "we then present the extracted @xmath60 transition amplitudes , together with the improved results for resonance pole masses , @xmath8 elastic residues , and the @xmath2 transition amplitudes . in this work ,",
    "we focus on studying the transition amplitudes at the photon point , @xmath61 .",

    ", we also present the results obtained by the bonn - gatchina ( boga ) analysis  @xcite for a comparison .",
    "the results from ours and boga show a reasonable agreement for the transition amplitudes , for which the boga analysis assigns relatively small uncertainties for the extracted amplitudes . in particular , our results for the first @xmath120 ,",
    "@xmath121 , and @xmath122 resonances , which correspond respectively to @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 in the pdg notation , are in good agreement with the boga results .",
    "however , some disagreement is also seen for several @xmath5 resonances .",
    "the boga analysis gives positive @xmath126 for the second @xmath120 resonance , while in our analysis @xmath126 is negative and very small . to obtain a more conclusive result for this transition amplitude , however , we would also need to take into account @xmath127 photoproduction data , as discussed in ref .",
    "we hope to make this extended analysis by directly analyzing @xmath128 reactions , rather than analyzing the @xmath129 data provided by other experiment / analysis groups , and this will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the origin of a significant disagreement in the transition amplitudes for the @xmath130 resonances would also come from a couple of reasons : ( a ) the pole mass of the second @xmath130 resonance from two analyses is different ; i.e. , @xmath131 mev from our analysis and @xmath132 mev from boga .",
    "since the value of the residue has a strong correlation with the pole mass and more sensitive to the analysis model used in each analysis , one should first determine the pole mass well to accomplish a precise determination of the residues .",
    "( b ) the @xmath130 resonances are found to give a small contribution to the @xmath133 reactions within our dcc model , and thus the @xmath60 transition amplitudes are not well constrained by the @xmath133 data .",
    "therefore , to get more convergent results , we would need to further include the data associated with the other meson photoproductions off the neutron , such as @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath15 productions , into our fits to get convergent results .",

    "combining the @xmath60 and @xmath2 transition amplitudes listed in tables  [ tab : helicity_p ] and  [ tab : helicity_n ] , we can obtain the isovector ( @xmath136 ) and isoscalar ( @xmath137 ) parts of the @xmath62 amplitude for @xmath28=1/2 @xmath5 by using the following well - known relations : @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are helicity amplitudes for @xmath64 and @xmath63 transitions , respectively .",
    "the resulting values of the isospin - decomposed transition amplitudes within our current dcc analysis is presented in table  [ tab : helicity_n - iso ] as a reference .",
    "in this work , we have extended our dcc analysis  @xcite of the @xmath58 reactions by further including the data for pion photoproductions off the neutron target , @xmath133 , in the fits .",
    "the helicity amplitudes for the @xmath60 transition , defined by the residues of the poles of the scattering amplitudes , have then been extracted . through this combined analysis of both the proton- and neutron - target reactions ,",
    "the resonance pole masses and the @xmath2 transition amplitudes extracted from our previous analysis  @xcite have also been revised accordingly .",
    "our results allow an isospin decomposition of the @xmath101 transitions , which is needed for testing the hadron structure calculations and investigating the neutrino - induced reactions  @xcite .",
    "the extracted @xmath60 transition amplitudes are compared with the results of the boga analysis .",
    "it is found that two results are consistent with each other overall .",
    "however , some significant disagreements also exist for several @xmath5 resonances , implying that further extensions of both analyses to analyze more complete data on the neutron target will be needed to make progress .",
    "as mentioned throughout this paper , in our current analysis we have used the @xmath141 data extracted from the @xmath142 data by other experiment / analysis groups . in most experimental analyses , the @xmath133",
    "cross sections and polarization observables are extracted by simply applying momentum cuts to the deuteron data and choosing the kinematics where the quasi - free mechanisms are assumed to dominate the reaction processes .",
    "effects of the nucleon fermi motion inside the deuteron have also been included in some analyses , but final @xmath143 interactions are usually neglected . on the other hand , several theoretical investigations  @xcite have shown that the @xmath143 final - state interaction has very large effects on the @xmath144 reaction .",
    "similar large effects are expected also for the other neutral - meson productions such as @xmath145 with @xmath146 . to make further progress in the study of the @xmath5 spectroscopy ,",
    "an approach for investigating these meson production reactions off the deuteron must be developed .",
    "since the accuracy of the extracted @xmath133 data depends on the way of unfolding the many body effects from the raw data , it is highly desirable to analyze directly the data of @xmath142 reactions based on a well - developed reaction model .",
    "the dcc model employed in our analysis is particularly useful for the analysis of @xmath147-d and also @xmath147-nuclei reactions since the necessary off - shell amplitudes are readily available . to complete such a analysis , a method to describe",
    "the @xmath143 dynamics in the @xmath7 and higher @xmath5 resonance region has to be explored .",
