    "cosmology has entered a precision era .",
    "the premier cosmological dataset is the anisotropies and polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "this is not only due to the highly accurate data , but also because of its simple theoretical description , which allows accurate calculations .",
    "present cmb codes like camb  @xcite and class  @xcite are typically 0.1% accurate and , together with contemporary data , provide a determination of basic cosmological parameters to the percent level ( and substantially better for the case of curvature )  @xcite .",
    "a puzzling result from current cmb measurements is that the hubble parameter @xmath0 is significantly smaller than the value measured locally  @xcite .",
    "parameter estimation from the cmb is extremely sensitive to the angular diameter distance @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the redshift of the last scattering surface .",
    "more precisely it depends on the angular size of the sound horizon , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the sound horizon at last scattering .",
    "the planck collaboration  @xcite has reported @xmath7 ; hence it measures this scale with an accuracy of better than @xmath8 .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath6 is slightly worse , about @xmath9 , which is also the accuracy of @xmath3 .",
    "these numbers indicate that a change of @xmath10 percent in @xmath3 is critical for parameter estimation of the cmb at the present level of accuracy .",
    "most calculations of the cmb anisotropies are performed within first - order perturbation theory and only cmb lensing requires a second - order analysis including first - order angular deflection of first - order temperature anisotropies and polarization . in this work",
    "we consider the homogeneous change in the angular diameter distance due to the presence of structures in the universe , up to second order in perturbation theory .",
    "we argue that it is critical to include this change at the present level of accuracy , as it induces a change in the mean distance to the last scattering surface which is larger than the current measurement error . including",
    "this change could remove the the tension between the values of @xmath0 obtained by cmb observations and by local measurements .",
    "this change then affects other parameters which depend on @xmath0 .",
    "for example , @xmath11 is well determined by the cmb , and so a change in @xmath12 implies @xmath13 moves significantly away from its naive value inferred without inclusion of this relativistic second - order correction .",
    "( here @xmath12 is defined by @xmath14kms@xmath15mpc@xmath15 . )    the observed angular diameter distance at observed redshift @xmath16 in direction @xmath17 is [ bdjscksjdb ] d_a(z_s , n)&=&11+z_s + & = & |d_a(z_s)[1+(z_s , n ) ] , [ da ] which has a perturbation @xmath18 about the the background distance @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the comoving distance ( in the background geometry ) to the source at observed redshift @xmath16 and @xmath21 is the conformal hubble rate .",
    "the perturbation @xmath18 arises from the fact that the universe is not homogeneous and isotropic , but contains cosmic structures which induce fluctuations in the geometry . at linear order in perturbation theory",
    ", the lensing convergence @xmath22 produces no change in the mean value @xmath23 ( although it does give a variance )  @xcite . at second order , however , nonlinear effects give a relativistic correction to the distance - redshift relation that a typical observer would expect .",
    "this correction can be calculated from the ensemble average : [ ens ] d^_a(z_s ) = d_a(z_s , n)=|d_a(z_s)[1+(z_s ) ] , where we assume statistically isotropic gaussian initial perturbations , so that there is no dependence on directions ( all directions receive the same correction ) .",
    "if it is not correctly taken into account , the shift in the ` background ' distance - redshift relation by @xmath24 could result in a shift in the inferred cosmological parameters which appear in the distance - redshift relation .",
    "we begin by anticipating that this correction is imposed by conservation of flux , and we show rigorously in the appendices that this follows from purely geometrical arguments using the geodesic deviation equation for null geodesics .",
    "gravitational lensing conserves the total photon flux @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the luminosity distance .",
    "this is a fully nonlinear and general result based on the analysis of lightrays in curved spacetime . in the case of the cmb",
    ", this implies that a spatial average of the flux must be conserved from one time to the next .",
    "because the cmb is emitted when the universe is very smooth , this implies that we should expect @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the value in the background .",
    "since @xmath29 , this implies the average of @xmath30 should be close to its background value at the same observed redshift .",
    "this means , @xmath31 , where the approximate equality means there are no significant corrections , i.e. , no corrections as large as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the matter over - density .",
    "we expand perturbatively , d_a^-2=. the linear term vanishes on average by definition : @xmath34",
    ". then , flux conservation implies , on average , @xmath35 and consequently [ e : delta ] ( ) ^2=^2 . where @xmath36 is the usual linear lensing convergence .",
    "this is actually the leading contribution to the expected change to large distances .",
    "we prove this remarkably simple and important result in a variety of ways in several appendices .",
    "it implies that the total area of a sphere of constant redshift will be larger than in the background .",
    "physically this is because a sphere about us in redshift space is not a sphere in real space   lensing implies that this ` sphere ' becomes significantly crumpled in real space , and hence has a larger area .",
    "when interpreted as a shift to the background geometry , this would have important implications for the analysis of the cmb .",
    "an observed patch of the cmb sky such as a hot or cold spot of a fixed observed angular scale will correspond to a physical area which is larger than the background value , since the distance to it is larger .",
    "effectively , it is the angular size of these hot and cold spots , combined with a theoretical model for calculating both the distance to the cmb and the sound horizon scale at last scattering , that determine many key parameters of the cosmological standard model .",
    "consequently , we anticipate a shift in the inferred background cosmology when aggregated lensing is taken into account .    here",
    "we quantify this shift for a flat @xmath37cdm ( concordance ) background , see the result plotted in  fig .",
    "[ sdjhbcsdb ] , and we explore the potential consequences for precision cosmology . at low redshifts",
    "the change to @xmath38 is small ( @xmath39 ) , negative and dominated by local effects ( from coupled velocity and sachs - wolfe terms ) .",
    "recently @xcite have estimated the effect of this change on @xmath0 and especially on its variance measured with low-@xmath40 data .",
    "for @xmath41 the change becomes positive and is dominated by second - order lensing effects .",
    "it grows monotonically until last scattering , and the distance to the cmb is increased by about one percent .     to the distance",
    "[ see ] for a fiducial model @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the correction is negative for @xmath44 , purely from the local contribution . at higher",
    "redshift the shift arises from the aggregated lensing term  . for @xmath45 the corrections grow @xmath46 , and are similar to an open @xmath37cdm model with @xmath47 ( grey ` curved ' , shown for high @xmath40 ) . ]",
    "if this shift is not taken into account , the distance - redshift relation for flat @xmath37cdm will appear to be that of a slightly open model ( @xmath48 ) , due to the slight shrinking of objects relative to the background . at high redshift @xmath45 ,",
    "the effective distance is similar to an open @xmath37cdm model . at the cmb redshift , measurement of one value @xmath3",
    "requires a change in @xmath0 in the background model to account for this shift .",
    "the incorporation of perturbations to the monopole of the local @xmath49 relation was first considered in  @xcite using a series expansion , where it was speculated to produce large contributions from small - scale power .",
    "( we discuss the contribution of small - scale power below . ) a later study in  @xcite used ` lightcone averaging ' to analyze the monopole of the magnitude - redshift relation at low to moderate redshift .",
    "the effect was predicted to be small , consistent with our low redshift results , but in contrast with @xcite .",
    "none of these works consider the impact on cosmological parameter estimation from cmb observations . here",
    "we focus on high-@xmath40 , where the aggregation of lensing events is more significant .",
    "we use ensemble averaging , so that specifically considering the monopole is unnecessary when the perturbations are statistically isotropic .",
    "the approach here is significantly simpler than the results obtained in the papers cited above .",
    "the details of the calculation , including four independent derivations of the main formula ( [ e : delta ] ) , are presented in the appendices .",
    "the second - order perturbation of @xmath50 about a flat @xmath37cdm background in the poisson gauge has been given in  @xcite based on the sachs equations ( see also  @xcite for another approach ) .",
    "assuming no anisotropic pressure and no vectors and tensors at linear order means the first - order modes are determined by a separable potential @xmath51 , normalized such that @xmath52 . here",
    "@xmath53 is conformal time and @xmath54 denotes today .",
    "the perturbation @xmath55 splits into local terms evaluated at either the source or observer , local times integrated terms , and integrated terms  @xcite .",
    "the key local terms are not revelevant for us , and are discussed in appendix  [ lsadvbasdb ]",
    ".    the key integrated terms at second - order are those with a total of 4 screen - space derivatives which do not form part of a 2-divergence in the screen space .",
    "( a pure 2-divergence gives zero contribution to the ensemble average . ) in appendix  [ derivation1 ] we derive this result from the well known sachs equation .",

    "the amplitude is positive , implying larger distances , and grows roughly linearly in @xmath40 reaching near percent - level around @xmath79 , thereafter growing proportional to the volume [ roughly approximated by ] reaching around 1% by @xmath80 .",
    "this is the aggregated lensing signal . a higher matter density or hubble constant increases the amplitude of @xmath24 , while increasing the baryon fraction or including a tilt to @xmath81 decreases it by tens of percent .",
    "the convergence of the sum in   is very slow , reflecting the sensitivity to the accumulation of many small - scale lensing events .",
    "we can attempt to estimate the convergence rate analytically to determine the modes that are important .",

    "consequently for percent - level accuracy we need @xmath84mpc@xmath15 .",
    "this seems reasonable , but actually overestimates the convergence rate significantly . including the logarithmic amplification of small - scale power in a more accurate transfer function slows the convergence so that percent accuracy is achieved for only for @xmath85 , while @xmath86 is only 10% accurate .",
    "this slow convergence remains also when baryons are included or small - scale power is amplified by a factor of 2 according to  @xcite .",
    "_ this implies that modes down to 10kpc scales in principle contribute to the aggregated lensing effect , and can not be neglected .",
    "since the power spectrum is not precisely modelled on these scales , we present our results for the linear , analytical approximation to the power spectrum given in ref .",
    "this in general underestimates the true power spectrum on small scales , however , most of the effect accumulates at high @xmath40 where linear theory is accurate , so our key results should be correct",
    ".    one may ask whether we should add an ultraviolet cutoff to smooth away small scale power in @xmath87 .",
    "this is appropriate when binning data and calculating correlation functions , for example , as the data sample effectively smooths over the linear matter distribution .",
    "this is not the case for the cumulative relativistic correction considered here , which is effectively a sum over all possible lensing events to give an ensemble average .",
    "note also that , neglecting the mild time dependence of @xmath87 the expression in is positive definite and smoothing does nor reduce it .",
    "the physically relevant dark matter free - streaming cutoff is @xmath88 , but this does not change our results . a larger uv - cutoff   equivalent to smoothing @xmath87   simply investigates a different ensemble of universes with different lensing properties on small scales , quite unlike the real universe , and underestimats the size of the effect ( linear theory with no cutoff still slightly underestimates it , but not by much ) . for small objects like snia",
    "it is clear we need high @xmath89-modes as the lightrays probe such small scales  @xcite . for a diffuse background like the cmb it is tempting to assume that the cmb light effectively smooths the matter distribution on the scale of observation .",
    "that is true at linear order , but not at second order , where the lensing effects accumulate and do not cancel in the same way .",
    "mathematically , if we smooth @xmath90 over a solid angle on the sky , we would eventually integrate against a window function in @xmath91 ; but this integral simply drops out after applying the spherical harmonic addition theorem , making no difference to @xmath24 .",
    "this is not the same as a cutoff in @xmath89 , which smooths @xmath87 itself , not @xmath90 .",
    "consequently , it is important not to smooth the potential , and include power down to the smallest relevant scales .",
    "we now explore the potential effects on parameter estimation from the cmb under the assumption that the correction from aggregated lensing can be interpreted as a monopole shift in the distance .",
    "this assumption requires further justification , as we discuss in the conclusions , and it is likely that our parameter estimates will be shifted when the full effects of aggregated lensing are taken into account . we leave this for further work .",
    "if the distance to the cmb is changed by a homogeneous factor @xmath92 , @xmath93 , features in the cmb are simply rescaled .",
    "more precisely , within the flat sky approximation which can be used for @xmath94 , the cmb power spectrum @xmath95 changes as  @xcite c_(1 + _ * ) ^2c_(1 + _ * ) .",
    "we find that the shift in the distance to the cmb is well approximated by _ * = 0.63 _",
    "m^1.1f_b+1.8 h^2.5f_b+3 n_s^5 e^-0.28_b/0.0222 where the baryon fraction is @xmath96 .",
    "this is accurate to about 1% in the vicinity of the planck parameter values , and 10% accurate well outside that range .    using the planck parameters for @xmath97 , @xmath12 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( as independent gaussian distributed values from ` planck+lensing ' , table 2 in  @xcite , and setting @xmath100 ) we find ( z_*)_*= 0.0102850.00074 .",
    "hence aggregated lensing leads to a change of about 1% in the distance to the cmb which is extremely important for cmb parameter estimation .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath12.5@xmath2 error on the planck estimation of the distance , so we anticipate that background parameters dependent on this distance shift by about 2.5@xmath2 .",

    "one might be surprised that a 1% shift in @xmath50 yields such a large ( about 5% ) shift in @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "however , a short calculation shows that this is to be expected : at fixed @xmath109 , neglecting curvature and radiation we have d_a(z _ * ) & = & _ 0^z _ * + ( z _ * ) & = & _ 0^z_*. where @xmath114kms@xmath15mpc@xmath115mpc . if we want to absorb a change in @xmath50 as a change in the background value of @xmath12 we use the fact that the background value of the distance needs to be reduced by @xmath55 from its observed value : d_a^&=&|d_a(|h)(1 + )   +    & = & |d_a(h ) + h_h we require a change in @xmath12 , @xmath116 given by _",

    "the cmb data remains consistent with a minimal flat @xmath112cdm model .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard calculation of distance where it is difficult to relieve the tension between local measurements of @xmath0  @xcite and the value from cmb observations .    clearly , the analysis presented here is not definitive for several reasons .",
    "first , as mentioned above , the planck measurements of cosmological parameters are not independent and especially the planck value of @xmath109 is not completely independent of the distance @xmath50 .",
    "we have also assumed a simple linear transfer function  @xcite .",
    "a full likelihood analysis should be performed with @xmath24 properly included .",
    "furthermore , aggregated lensing not only leads to a average shift in the distance to the cmb but @xmath55 is actually direction dependent  @xcite .",
    "we expect its fluctuations to be imprinted as additional fluctuations in the cmb .",
    "however , since the dominant contribution comes from very small scales , we expect them to show up mainly at high @xmath122 and we believe that the effect on the mean distance discussed here is the dominant one in present cmb experiments . to do a fully consistent analysis , which combines second order fluctuations in the distance with temperature perturbations , a 3rd order boltzmann solver would be needed . a interesting future project which is ( far ! ) beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we also note that higher - order contributions to @xmath24 will be small , though ultimately necessary as observations improve .",
    "we anticipate they will be dominated by terms such as @xmath123 , which will lead to a percent level correction to our second - order correction .",
    "thus , the main contribution to aggregated lensing is from  .",
    "we have demonstrated an important overall shift in the distance redshift relation when the aggregate of all lensing events is considered , calculated by averaging over an ensemble of universes . this result is a consequence of flux conservation at second - order in perturbation theory .",
    "this is a purely relativistic effect with no newtonian counterpart   and it is the first quantitative prediction for a significant change to the background cosmology when averaging over structure  @xcite .",
    "the extraordinary amplification of aggregated lensing comes mainly from the integrated lensing of structure on scales in the range @xmath124mpc , although structure down to 10kpc scales contributes significantly .",
    "we have estimated the size of the effect using a linear transfer function which slightly underestimates power on small scales at high redshift , so this provides a robust lower limit to the overall amplitude .",
    "higher - order corrections from relativistic perturbation theory will enter @xmath125 , making the main contribution in general .",
    "this isotropic shift is particularly important for high redshift , apparently giving a change to the distance to the cmb of one percent .",
    "what does this mean ?",
    "we have argued that the shift can be interpreted as a change to the inferred background cosmology . assuming that observations of the cmb really measures the area distance implies that fitting to the minimal @xmath112cdm model leads to an underestimation of the hubble parameter by 5% .",
    "we have considered the consequences for analysing the cmb , and have argued that parameter estimation could be strongly affected  ",
    "parameter constraints can be shifted by more than @xmath126 . because the shift @xmath24 increases the distance relative to the background , the corrections to the background to compensate for this increase in distance",
    "are achieved by increasing @xmath12 . in particular , we have shown that a higher @xmath12 is naturally preferred over the low value found by planck  @xcite , in line with local data  @xcite . for current and future redshift surveys , the effective model yields sub - percent changes to the curvature , and dark energy parameters , which will eventually be important for precision cosmology of the coming decade .",
    "of course , our analysis is rather simplistic .",
    "we have calculated the expected correction to the distance of an infinitesimal spot on the cmb sky and extrapolated up to sound - horizon scales .",
    "we have assumed that the cmb temperature map directly measures the distance to last scattering , when in fact it is inferred indirectly .",
    "the full correction to the background parameters corresponding to aggregated lensing   a change to the global distance from the sum of all lensing events   may well give quite different results .",
    "nevertheless , as our simple consideration has led to 5% difference in the estimated hubble parameter , and 10% in @xmath13 , it is clear that 2nd order aggregated lensing has to be included in a cmb calculation which aspires to a precision of 0.1% . beyond linear perturbation theory ,",
    "the correspondence between the expectation value of observables and the averaged background model becomes very subtle to define precisely .",
    "we have shown that it could lead to important corrections to the background when asking , what is the distance to the  cmb ?     + * acknowledgements : * special thanks to camille bonvin , antony lewis and fabien schmidt for extensive and very helpful discussions .",
