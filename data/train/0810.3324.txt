    "there are two main reasons for revisiting soft @xmath5 high energy interactions at this time .",
    "* a. *  to predict soft processes at the lhc we need a reliable model .",
    "a detailed analysis performed in the late sixties @xcite showed that there could be different scenarios for the high - energy behaviour of the interaction amplitude .",
    "in the ` weak coupling ' regime the total cross section @xmath6 , and in order not to violate unitarity , and to satisfy the inequality @xmath7 the triple - pomeron vertex must vanish when @xmath8 , that is @xmath9 . in this case , the large logarithm coming from the integration over the mass of the system produced in diffractive dissociation ( @xmath10 ) is compensated by the small value of the mean momentum transferred through the pomeron @xmath11 .",
    "on the other hand , for ` strong coupling ' , with @xmath12 with @xmath13 , the inequality ( [ eq:1 ] ) is provided by a small value of the rapidity gap survival factor @xmath14 which decreases with energy .",
    "the present diffractive data are better described within the ` strong coupling ' approach , and here we show predictions for the lhc for this scenario .",
    "however , the possibility of the ` weak coupling ' scenario is not completely excluded yet .",
    "therefore , it is quite important to study the different channels of diffractive dissociation at the lhc in order to reach a final conclusion and to fix the parameters of the model for high - energy soft interactions .    *",
    "b. *   the second reason for studying soft interactions arises because it may not be an easy task to distinguish the production of a new object at the lhc when it is accompanied by hundreds other particles emitted in the same event . for the detailed study of the new object , @xmath15 , it may be better to select the few , very clean , events with the large rapidity gaps ( lrg ) on either side of the new object @xcite .",
    "that is to observe the exclusive process @xmath16 .",
    "in such a central exclusive process ( cep ) the mass of @xmath15 can be measured with very good accuracy ( @xmath17 gev ) by the missing - mass method by detecting the outgoing forward protons . moreover",
    ", a specific @xmath18 selection rule @xcite reduces the background and also greatly simplifies the spin - parity analysis of @xmath15 . however , the cep cross section is strongly suppressed by the small survival factor , @xmath19 , of the rapidity gaps .",
    "thus we need a reliable model of soft interactions to evaluate the corresponding value of @xmath14 .",
    "the total and elastic proton - proton cross sections are usually described in terms of an eikonal model , which automatically satisfies @xmath20-channel elastic unitarity . to account for the possibility of excitation of the initial proton , that is for two - particle intermediate states with the proton replaced by @xmath21",
    ", we use the good - walker formalism @xcite . already at tevatron energies the absorptive correction to the elastic amplitude , due to elastic eikonal rescattering , is not negligible ; it is about 20% in comparison with the simple one pomeron exchange .",
    "after accounting for low - mass proton excitations ( that is @xmath21 s in the intermediate states ) the correction becomes twice larger ( that is , up to 40% ) .",
    "next , in order to describe high - mass diffractive dissociation , @xmath22 , we have to include an extra factor of 2 from the agk cutting rules @xcite .",
    "thus , the absorptive effects in the triple - regge domain are expected to be quite large .",
    "the previous triple - regge analyses ( see , for example , @xcite ) did not allow for absorptive corrections and the resulting triple - regge couplings must be regarded , not as bare vertices , but as effective couplings embodying the absorptive effects . since the inelastic cross section ( and , therefore , the absorptive corrections ) expected at the lhc are more than twice as large as that observed at fixed - target and cern - isr energies , the old triple - regge vertices can not be used to predict the diffractive cross sections at the lhc .",
    "thus , it is necessary to perform a new triple - regge analysis that includes the absorptive effects explicitly .",
    "cross section @xmath23 data obtained in the strong triple - pomeron coupling fit , where @xmath24 .",
    "the individual triple - regge contributions are also shown.,height=566 ]    [ fig1 ]    together with e.g.d.s.luna , we fitted @xcite the fixed - target fnal , cern - isr and tevatron data that are available in the triple - regge region .",
    "we included ` @xmath25 ' , ` @xmath26 ' , ` @xmath27 ' , ` @xmath28 ' and @xmath29 contributions , assuming either the ` strong ' or ` weak ' coupling scenarios for the behaviour of the triple - pomeron vertex . to account for the absorptive corrections we used a two - channel ( good - walker ) eikonal model , which describes well the total , @xmath30 , and elastic , @xmath31 , @xmath5 and @xmath32 cross sections .    in the ` strong ' coupling case , a good @xmath33dof=167/(210 - 8)=0.83",
    "was obtained .",
    "the quality of the description to a sample of the data can be seen in fig.1 , where the various triple - regge contributions to the cross section are also shown . in comparison with the old triple - regge analysis @xcite",
    ", we now have about a twice larger relative contribution of the ` @xmath26 ' term .",
    "this is mainly due to the inclusion in our analysis of the higher - energy tevatron data .",
    "since the absorptive effects are included explicitly , the extracted values of the triple - reggeon vertices are now much closer to the _ bare _ triple - regge couplings .",
    "in particular , the value @xmath34 is consistent with a reasonable extrapolation of the perturbative bfkl pomeron vertex to the low scale region @xcite ; here @xmath35 is the pomeron - proton coupling .",
    "note also that these values of ` @xmath25 ' and ` @xmath26 ' vertices allow us to describe the hera data @xcite on inelastic @xmath36 photoproduction , @xmath37 , where the screening corrections are rather small .",
    "the ` weak ' coupling scenario leads to a larger @xmath33dof=1.4 and to a worse description of the @xmath38 process at the lowest values of @xmath39 . at the lhc energy",
    "the ` weak ' coupling fit predicts about 3 times smaller inclusive cross section @xmath40 at @xmath41 in comparison with that predicted in the ` strong ' coupling case .",
    "since the triple - pomeron vertex ( [ eq:2 ] ) turns out to be rather large , the contribution of the so - called ` enhanced ' diagrams , with a few vertices , is not negligible .",
    "moreover , we can not expect that more complicated multi - pomeron interactions , driven by the @xmath42 vertices , which describe the transition of @xmath43 to @xmath44 pomerons , will not affect the final result .",
    "it looks more reasonable to assume that @xmath45 than to assume that @xmath46 for any @xmath47 .",
    "thus we need a model which accounts for the possibility of multi - pomeron interactions ( with arbitrary @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) .    while the eikonal formalism describes the rescattering of the incoming fast particles , the enhanced multi - pomeron diagrams represent the rescattering of the intermediate partons in the ladder ( feynman diagram ) which describes the pomeron - exchange amplitude .",
    "the ladder - type pomeron amplitude may be generated by the evolution equation ( in rapidity , @xmath48 , space ) @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the two - dimensional vector in impact parameter space and @xmath51 is the slope of the pomeron trajectory .",
    "@xmath52 is the probability to emit new intermediate partons within unit rapidity interval ; the pomeron intercept @xmath53 .",
    "the solution of ( [ eq:3 ] ) , @xmath54 , is the opacity ( at point @xmath55 ) , corresponding to the incoming particle placed at @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "it looks natural to account for absorptive effects by including on the r.h.s . of ( [ eq:3 ] )",
    "the factor @xmath58 , where the subscripts @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote the opacities of the beam and the target incoming hadrons .",
    "we thus have the evolution equations @xmath61 @xmath62 where here @xmath63 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath64 accounts for the fact that the absorptive cross section for the intermediate parton , @xmath65 , may be different from that for the incoming particle ( proton ) . since the equations ( [ eq:3]-[eq:5 ] ) describe the interaction amplitude and not the cross section we have a factor @xmath66 in the exponent . in terms of multi - pomeron vertices , the absorption factors , @xmath67 , in ( [ eq:4],[eq:5 ] )",
    "correspond to @xmath68 note that , since the intermediate parton may be absorbed by the interaction with the particles ( partons ) from the wave function of both beam or target hadron , we now need to solve the two equations , ( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "this is done iteratively .",
    "the resulting solution solution can then be used in the eikonal formulae to determine all soft @xmath5 interactions .    in comparison with our previous model @xcite",
    ", we now include a non - zero slope ( @xmath69 ) of the pomeron trajectory .",
    "the incoming proton wave function is described by three good - walker eigenstates , that is we use a 3-channel eikonal for the rescattering of fast particles .",
    "the transverse size squared of each eigenstate is proportional to the corresponding absorptive cross section ; @xmath70 .",
    "that is we assume that the parton density at the origin is the same for each eigenstate .",
    "the shape of the pomeron - nucleon vertex is parametrised by the form factor @xmath71 , whose fourier transform , @xmath72 , plays the role of the initial conditions for @xmath73 .",
    "next , we allow for four different @xmath39-channel states , which we label @xmath74 : one for the secondary reggeon ( @xmath75 ) trajectory and three pomeron states ( @xmath76 ) to mimic the bfkl diffusion in the logarithm of parton transverse momentum , @xmath77 @xcite . to be precise , since the bfkl pomeron @xcite is not a pole in the complex @xmath78-plane , but a branch cut , we approximate the cut by three @xmath39-channel states of a different size",
    ". the typical values of @xmath79 in each of the three states is about @xmath80 gev , @xmath81 gev and @xmath82 gev .",
    "thus the system ( [ eq:4],[eq:5 ] ) is replaced by @xmath83 @xmath84 the transition factors @xmath85 were fixed by properties of the bfkl equation . in the exponents , the opacities @xmath86 ( @xmath87 )",
    "are actually the sum of the opacities @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) with corresponding coefficients ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "clearly the number of parameters in such a model is large .",
    "therefore , instead of a straightforward fit of the data , we adjust the majority of parameters in reasonable intervals and demonstrate that such a model allows us to reproduce all the available data on diffractive cross sections , @xmath90 .",
    "the quality of the description is demonstrated in fig.2 , where we also present the prediction for elastic cross section at the lhc energy @xmath91 tev .",
    "dependence of the elastic @xmath5 cross section data .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines are the contributions at the lhc energy from the elastic scattering of the largest size ( @xmath92 ) and the smallest size ( @xmath93 ) components .",
    "interestingly , we see that the complete set of eikonal contributions gives a smooth prediction for the elastic cross section in this @xmath39 interval at the lhc energy.,height=680 ]    [ fig2 ]    the values of the parameters that we use are : @xmath94 gev@xmath95 , @xmath96 gev@xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 gev@xmath95 , @xmath100 and , for each of 3 components of the pomeron , @xmath101",
    ". the pomeron intercepts are consistent with the expectations of resummed nll bfkl which gives @xmath102 practically independent of the scale @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the slopes of the pomeron trajectories are : @xmath103 gev@xmath95 for the large size pomeron component , @xmath104 gev@xmath95 for the second component ( @xmath105 ) , and @xmath106 for the smallest size pomeron component .",
    "ths model , which we have tuned to describe the available data , allows us to predict , in principle , all features of soft @xmath5 high energy interactions .",
    "let us consider the cross section for beam particle diffractive dissociation ( with a rapidity gap up to @xmath48 ) .",
    "first recall the usual eikonal relations @xmath107 for each impact parameter point @xmath50 , the desired cross section for single dissociation is proportional ( i ) to the elastic parton @xmath108 cross section @xmath109 ; ( ii ) to the probability to find the intermediate parton @xmath65 in the interval @xmath110 , that is @xmath111 ; ( iii ) to the amplitude @xmath86 of the parton @xmath112 beam interaction ; ( iv ) to the gap survival factor @xmath113 ( where @xmath114 ) .",
    "the resulting cross section reads @xmath115 @xmath116 where @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) are the coordinates in the impact parameter plane with respect to the target ( beam ) hadron .",
    "expression ( [ eq : sd ] ) must be averaged over the components ( that is the good - walker eigenstates ) of the beam and target hadrons and summed over the different @xmath39-channel states ( @xmath119 ) with appropriate normalisation factors @xmath120 .",
    "the energy behaviour of the diffractive cross sections , and of the multiplicities of the secondaries produced by the @xmath39-channel pomeron components of different sizes , are shown in fig.3 .",
    "cross sections and ( c ) the cross sections of dissociation to a fixed @xmath121 state , where @xmath24 . plot ( d ) shows the parton multiplicity ( solid lines ) and the number of ` colour tubes ' ( dashed ) produced by the pomeron components of different size.,height=680 ]    [ fig3 ]    note that , starting with the same ` bare ' intercepts ( @xmath122 ) , after the absorptive correction , the contribution of the large - size component becomes practically flat , while the small - size contribution , which is much less affected by the absorption , continues to grow with energy .",
    "such a behaviour is consistent with experiment , where the density of low @xmath79 secondaries is practically saturated , while the probability to produce a hadron with a large transverse momentum ( say , more than 5 gev ) grows with the initial energy .",
    "after accounting for absorptive effects the new triple - regge analysis leads to a rather large triple - pomeron vertex @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "this indicates that in order to describe diffractive processes at the lhc we must use a model which includes multi - pomeron interactions .",
    "we construct such a model in which the absorption of the intermediate partons is described by conventional - like factors @xmath125 . in terms of the multi - pomeron vertices",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath126 .",
    "the model reasonably well reproduces available diffractive data on @xmath127 using the parameters : @xmath122 , @xmath128 gev@xmath95 , @xmath98 .",
    "it thus leads to the hope that there is a smooth matching between the perturbative qcd treatment of the pomeron and the multi - pomeron description of soft interactions .",
    "since the screening corrections caused by the ` enhanced ' multi - pomeron diagrams , that is by the high - mass dissociation , slow down the growth of the cross section with energy , the model predicts a relatively low total cross section at the lhc energy , namely @xmath129 mb  @xcite .",
    "predictions for lhc soft interactions are shown in figs . 2 and 3",
