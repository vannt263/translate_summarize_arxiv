    "inspired by the pioneering global fits of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix developed by the ckmfitter group @xcite and the utfit collaboration @xcite for the interpretation of flavor - physics results from the @xmath3 factories and the tevatron , we outline the prospects for the elucidation of physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) via a global fit of neutron @xmath0 decay observables , including the lifetime and the energy - dependence of the angular correlation coefficients .",
    "our global fit , which we term @xmath4fitter , employs a maximum likelihood statistical framework which accounts for both experimental and theoretical uncertainties , with the latter arising primarily from the poorly known weak hadronic second - class currents .",
    "the elucidation of a `` @xmath2 '' law @xcite in the mediation of low - energy weak interactions played a crucial role in the rise of the standard model ( sm )  @xcite .",
    "a variety of well - motivated sm extensions speak to the possibility of new dynamics at the fermi scale , which we identify via @xmath5 , and , concomitantly , to tangible departures from the @xmath2 law in low - energy weak processes , be it through scalar or tensor interactions , or right - handed currents .",
    "alternatively , e.g. , new , light degrees of freedom could appear and yield violations of the @xmath2 law  if probed at sufficient experimental resolution . at the same time , an ongoing vigorous experimental program for precision measurements of neutron @xmath0 decay observables with cold and ultracold neutrons @xcite exists with an overarching goal of realizing bettered assessments of the limits of the sm .",
    "the experimental effort focuses on measurements of two general types of observables : angular correlation coefficients , which parametrize the angular correlations between the momenta of the various decay products and/or the spin of the initial state neutron or electron in the differential decay rate , and the neutron lifetime @xmath6 . of the future experimental plans reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the claim of ultimate precision rests with the perc experiment @xcite , for a sensitivity of up to @xmath7 precision .",
    "the angular correlation coefficients @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath3 , and @xmath11  @xcite , of which only @xmath8 , @xmath10 , and @xmath3 are measured to be nonzero  @xcite , describe the distribution in electron and neutrino directions and electron energy in neutron decay . since the nucleon mass is markedly larger than the neutron - proton mass difference , a recoil expansion of the differential decay rate of the neutron in terms of the ratio of various small energy scales to the nucleon mass is extremely efficient .",
    "the @xmath8 , @xmath10 , and @xmath3 correlation coefficients in this order , which we denote with a `` @xmath12 '' subscript , are functions only of @xmath13 in the sm , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the weak axial - vector and vector coupling constants ; this is tantamount to the @xmath2 law .",
    "note that for consistency with earlier work @xcite , we employ a @xmath16 sign convention , so that the sign of the @xmath17 terms in the weak currents are chosen opposite to that of the particle data group @xcite .",
    "we also assume that @xmath18 is real , which has been established beyond our assumed level of sensitivity in the observables we consider  @xcite .",
    "thus , extractions of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 from the measured parameters @xmath8 , @xmath10 , and @xmath3 determine @xmath18 in the sm , which , by itself , is a fundamental parameter of the weak interaction . using the measured values for @xmath6 and @xmath18 determines @xmath15 and @xmath14 independently .",
    "the former , once radiative corrections are applied  @xcite , yields the ckm matrix element @xmath22 .",
    "a neutron - based value for @xmath22 @xcite is not yet competitive with the result extracted from measurements of the @xmath23 values in superallowed @xmath24 nuclear @xmath0 decays @xcite .",
    "such efforts are nevertheless well - motivated in that they are not subject to the nuclear structure corrections which must be applied in the analysis of @xmath24 transitions .",
    "we set such prospects aside and focus on the possibility of discovering dynamics beyond the sm through an assessed quantitative violation of the @xmath2 law .",
    "we consider neutron beta decay observables exclusively , though the framework  and fits  we employ can readily be enlarged to encompass all low - energy semileptonic processes involving first - generation quarks .",
    "this is possible because we can employ , rather generally , a single , quark - level effective lagrangian , at leading power in @xmath25  @xcite , for all such processes  @xcite , where we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a review . to realize this we need",
    "only assume that new physics appears at an energy scale @xmath26 in excess of the scale @xmath27 , crudely that of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 masses .",
    "this allows the construction of an effective lagrangian in terms of operators of mass dimension @xmath30 with @xmath31 @xcite , where the nonobservation of non - sm invariant operators in flavor physics  @xcite , allows us to impose sm electroweak gauge invariance in its construction . at leading power in @xmath25 , there are then precisely ten dimension - six operators describing the semileptonic decay of the @xmath30 quark .",
    "the coefficients of these operators can be determined , or at least constrained , through a global fit of @xmath0 decay observables  in neutrons and nuclei  and of meson decay observables as well .",
    "this quark - level description , upon matching to a nucleon - level effective theory  @xcite , yields a one - to - one map to the terms of the effective hamiltonian constructed by lee and yang @xcite , admitted by lorentz invariance and the possibility of parity violation @xcite .",
    "the latter framework is employed in the usual analysis of the angular correlations in beta decay  @xcite . the construction of the underlying quark - level effective theory allows the inclusion of meson observables on the same footing .",
    "global fits of the lee - yang coefficients have been made to beta decay observables , particularly of the phase - space - integrated angular correlation coefficients  @xcite . as we develop explicitly",
    ", the advantage of the current approach is that we can take theory errors into direct account in the optimization procedure .",
    "we focus on the simultaneous fit of the angular correlation coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath10 in neutron decay and of the neutron lifetime to limit the appearance of tensor and scalar interactions from physics bsm , in part because the theory errors in this case are spanned by the ill - known nucleon matrix elements of particular local operators , which presumably and eventually can be computed in qcd using the techniques of lattice gauge theory .",
    "the empirically determined correlation coefficients and neutron lifetime , fixed to some precision , can be used to set limits on new dynamics . in this regard",
    "it is natural to focus on the fierz interference term @xmath9 because it is linear in new physics couplings .",
    "that is , it is possible to discover evidence of scalar or tensor interactions , through a measurement of @xmath9 in excess of the @xmath32 level expected in the sm from recoil - order effects @xcite . to date",
    "there have been no published results for @xmath9 in neutron @xmath0 decay , although several efforts are underway .",
    "searches for scalar and tensor interactions have also been pursued via measurements of the decay electron s transverse polarizations with respect to the neutron spin @xcite , though no new experiments of such ilk are currently planned .",
    "information on @xmath9 can be gleaned in different ways .",
    "its presence modifies the shape of the electron energy spectrum in the differential decay rate , and direct searches probe that .",
    "it is also subsumed in measurements of the energy dependence of the @xmath8 , @xmath10 , and @xmath3 correlation coefficients @xcite , so that we wish to consider the additional experimental observables offered by ( electron ) energy dependence with some care .",
    "the latter pathways offer `` indirect '' access to @xmath9 and require greater statistical control than spectral shape measurements for fixed sensitivity to scalar and tensor interactions .",
    "however , they are also less sensitive to systematic errors , both experimental and theoretical . in this first paper",
    "we focus on access to scalar and tensor interactions through measurements of @xmath8 , @xmath10 , and @xmath6 , as we now explain .",
    "the @xmath2 description of neutron @xmath0 decay includes contributions from six possible weak hadronic currents which give rise , at recoil order , to energy - dependent expressions for the angular correlation coefficients .",
    "however , the most recent extractions of @xmath18 from @xmath10 @xcite , which yield , at present , the most precise determination of @xmath18 , have assumed the validity of the conserved - vector - current ( cvc ) hypothesis ( i.e. , the cvc value for the weak magnetism coupling ) and neglected second - class currents .",
    "this is certainly reasonable at the current level of experimental precision , although measurements of @xmath10 at the @xmath33% level of precision are , in principle , sensitive to the weak magnetism coupling , which contributes to the asymmetry at the @xmath34% level . with the anticipated increased sensitivity to @xmath8 , @xmath10 , and @xmath3 in next - generation experiments",
    ", we note that precise measurements of the energy dependence of the @xmath8 and @xmath10 correlations offer the possibility to test cvc and to search for second - class currents independently @xcite . in @xmath4fitter",
    "we fit the energy dependence of the angular correlation coefficients directly and thus need not assume either the validity of the cvc hypothesis or the absence of second - class currents , yielding a framework for a robust test of the validity of the @xmath2 description of neutron @xmath0 decay .",
    "the outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , we review the formalism for the analysis of neutron @xmath0 decay observables in sec .  [",
    "sec : formalism ] .",
    "we then briefly review in sec .",
    "[ sec : uncertainties ] the experimental status of , or limits on , the various sm parameters relevant to our global fit , such as second - class currents .",

    "[ sec : likelihood ] , where we discuss the construction of our likelihood function , as well as the inclusion of experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we illustrate the prospects of our global fit with a few numerical examples employing the frequentist , or specifically @xmath35fit @xcite , statistical procedure , reserving the use of alternative statistical procedures for later work .",
    "we then show examples of the results from @xmath4fitter fits to monte carlo generated pseudodata in sec .",
    "[ sec : example_fits ] under various scenarios , and we quantify via these examples the statistical impact that future improvements in the precision of neutron @xmath0 decay observables should have on the assessment of the validity of the sm .",
    "we also discuss the extent to which theoretical uncertainties in the presently poorly known second class contributions limit such assessments , and we can extract from such studies the precision to which they should be established to obviate that impact .",
    "finally , we conclude with a brief summary in sec.[sec : summary ] .",
    "if we suppose the low - energy , effective weak interaction , employing explicit @xmath4 and @xmath37 degrees of freedom , is mediated by the ten dimension - six operators enumerated by lee and yang @xcite , then the differential decay rate for neutron @xmath0 decay takes the form @xcite @xmath38\\ , , \\label{eq : w_angular_distribution}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we refer to ref .",

    "the @xmath11 term is a naively time - reversal - odd observable : a value for @xmath11 in excess of the @xmath49 level attributed to sm final - state interaction effects @xcite would reveal the existence of new cp - violating interactions at the lagrangian level ( assuming cpt holds ) . the current level of experimental precision places stringent constraints on any such new effects @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we report expressions for the correlation coefficients which include the tree - level new physics of the lee - yang hamiltonian and the contributions of the usual @xmath2 terms through recoil order . in realizing this",

    "each of them are then compared with a corresponding theoretical calculation of that quantity , @xmath174 .",

    "the set of @xmath176 parameters would include @xmath189 though we note that @xmath73 does not appear in @xmath0 decay observables computed through nlo precision .",
    "consequently we set @xmath190 in all that follows ; we refer the reader to the reviews of refs .",
    "@xcite for information on this quantity . in the next section where we show results from example fits for different scenarios , we define for each scenario which of the @xmath191 parameters are to be considered a free or calculated parameter .",
    "we note a subtlety in regards to @xmath18 : if it is a fit parameter , rather than a calculated one , it can be modified by the appearance of a right - handed coupling emergent from physics bsm  @xcite .",
    "thus the determined value of @xmath18 from a fit of neutron beta decay observables need not be equivalent to the calculated value of @xmath192",
    ". however , present lattice calculations of @xmath14 are of rather poorer precision than empirical determinations .",
    "the above sets could , of course , be trivially expanded to accommodate measurements of other observables ; for example , the @xmath181 set could include measurements of the neutrino asymmetry @xmath3 and ( direct ) measurements of the fierz interference term @xmath193 ( via spectral shape measurements ) , and/or the @xmath176 set could include @xmath193 .",
    "as per the usual prescription @xcite , we define our @xmath194 function in terms of a likelihood function @xmath195 for the @xmath176 parameter set as @xmath196 following the @xmath35fit framework @xcite , we define @xmath195 to be the product of an `` experimental likelihood '' function , @xmath197 , and a `` theoretical likelihood '' function , @xmath198 , @xmath199    the experimental likelihood function is defined in the usual way to be the product of the likelihood functions for each of the @xmath200 experimental results , @xmath201 where , in the ideal case , the individual likelihood functions are taken to be gaussian , @xmath202\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath203 denotes the statistical uncertainty of the @xmath184th experimental result .",
    "of course , the individual experimental likelihood functions must account for systematic errors , and the formalism for the inclusion of such within the context of the @xmath35fit framework is described in detail in refs .",
    "however , a detailed discussion of the impact of experimental systematic errors is beyond the scope of this paper , as the focus of our first paper is on the statistical impact of a global fit and the limitations on such from theoretical uncertainties .    in principle , a theoretical likelihood function could similarly be defined as the product of likelihood functions for each of the @xmath204 calculated parameters , @xmath205 and under the assumption that the @xmath204 values are gaussian distributed , the theoretical likelihood would , by definition , contribute to the @xmath194 .",
    "such a formulation might not be appropriate for the treatment of the @xmath204 parameters , for which the underlying probability distributions are certainly not known .",
    "however , it may well be possible to bound the value of each @xmath204 parameter on theoretical grounds , such that the parameter may reasonably assume any value over an allowed range of @xmath206 $ ]",
    ". it would be highly unlikely that the true value of the parameter would fall outside of this range .",
    "thus , given the lack of knowledge on the underlying distributions of the @xmath204 parameters , the proposal of the @xmath35fit scheme @xcite is to redefine the @xmath194 function so that the theoretical likelihood does not contribute to the @xmath194 , while the @xmath204 parameters are permitted to vary freely within their pre - defined allowed ranges . in particular",

    "thus , the central challenge of such an analysis in refs .",
    "@xcite is to define the @xmath209 $ ] allowed ranges carefully because : ( i ) the fit results for the @xmath178 parameters can be interpreted as valid only if the `` true '' values for the @xmath180 parameters fall within the allowed ranges ; and ( ii ) choosing the allowed ranges to be too wide ( i.e. , too conservative ) could mask the discovery of new physics .",
    "after construction of the @xmath194 , a global fit can be then be pursued under two different types of analyses : ( i ) determining values for the sm parameters ; and ( ii ) assessing the validity of the sm .",
    "here the goal is neither to assess the validity of the sm nor to search for evidence of new physics . instead",
    ", the sm is assumed to be valid , and the global fit is employed , optimally , to determine values for all of the @xmath176 parameters . in this case , the minimum value of @xmath210 , computed according to eq .",

    ".    however , in practice , it may not be possible , or feasible , to determine values for all of the @xmath176 parameters .",
    "the @xmath180 parameters , notably the second - class couplings , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and the induced pseudoscalar coupling @xmath73 , serve as examples .",
    "we let @xmath217 denote the @xmath218 subset of @xmath176 parameters for which the goal is to determine confidence levels ; the remainder of the @xmath219 parameters are denoted @xmath220 .",
    "note that the set of @xmath220 parameters may not be identical to the set of @xmath180 parameters .",
    "confidence levels on the @xmath217 parameter set are then determined by first computing _ at each point _ in the @xmath217 parameter space the minimal value of the @xmath194 function , @xmath221 , obtained by allowing the @xmath220 parameters to vary .",
    "the minimal value of @xmath222 at that point in the @xmath217 parameter space is then computed according to @xmath223 the confidence levels are then obtained from @xmath224      under the minimization scheme just described for the determination of sm parameters , the sm is assumed to be valid by definition . in principle",
    ", a test statistic for assessing the validity of the sm would be the value of @xmath211 obtained when all of the @xmath175 are varied , where a confidence level on the sm could be defined as @xmath225    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : neutron_lifetime_chi_square_g25 ]    we then perform a simultaneous fit to the @xmath226 new physics data set in which @xmath227 , i.e. , with only a single free parameter .",
    "we use the cvc value for @xmath71 and set @xmath228 to zero .",
    "as we have already noted , a simultaneous fit to the @xmath229 data set only yields excellent values for @xmath230  albeit , with significant pulls on the fitted values for @xmath18 .",
    "the neutron lifetime is relatively insensitive to new scalar or tensor physics , because such new physics only enters quadratically in the @xmath143 parameter , noting eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau_lambda_vud ] ) .",
    "therefore , we would expect a simultaneous fit to an @xmath231 data set in the presence of new scalar and tensor interactions to return a poor value for @xmath230 .",
    "indeed , the results of such an analysis are shown in table [ tab : neutron_lifetime_chi_square ] , where we show the fitted values for @xmath18 , the @xmath230 from the fit , and the probability for that @xmath230 value , for different assumed experimental errors on the lifetime . as can be seen , the probability for the validity of the sm , which we quantify via the statistic @xmath232 , as per sec .",

    "a precision in the neutron lifetime of 0.07  s would yield a probability of @xmath237 , which is slightly more stringent than the requirement for a @xmath238 result , i.e. , a probability of @xmath239 .",
    "finally we turn to an examination of the impact of a non - zero second - class coupling @xmath75 on the ability to falsify the @xmath2 law of the sm .",
    "it has been the usual procedure to ignore certain recoil corrections in the determination of @xmath6 , as per eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau_lambda_vud ] ) , but we expect that a non - zero value of @xmath75 could be important in this context , so that we include the recoil correction in @xmath75 , as per eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau_g2 ] ) , as well .",
    "we perform a simultaneous fit to the @xmath226 new physics data set in which @xmath227 and @xmath240 , where @xmath75 is permitted to vary over different particular ranges , with @xmath71 equal to its cvc value and @xmath156 .",
    "the empirical limits on @xmath75 are markedly weaker than the existing direct theoretical estimate , noting @xmath241 @xcite with @xmath118 @xcite , so that we perform simultaneous fits using @xmath75 in the following ranges : @xmath242 $ ] , @xmath243 $ ] , and @xmath244 $ ] .",
    "the fit results , as well as the determined abilities to falsify the sm , as a function of the error in the determined neutron lifetime , are shown for these ranges of @xmath75 in tables [ tab : neutron_lifetime_chi_square_g2s ] , [ tab : neutron_lifetime_chi_square_g21 ] , and [ tab : neutron_lifetime_chi_square_g25 ] , respectively .",
    "nonzero values of @xmath75 impact the ability to falsify the sm in every case , and the inclusion of the recoil corrections to @xmath6 are also of importance . in the last case , in which @xmath244 $ ] , the ability to falsify the sm with improving precision in the neutron lifetime has been completely eroded .",
    "evidently it is important to determine @xmath75 to the greatest accuracy possible in order to be able to falsify the @xmath2 law of the sm .",
    "in summary , we have developed a maximum likelihood statistical framework , which we term @xmath4fitter , in which we make simultaneous fits to various neutron @xmath0 decay observables .",
    "although a number of global fits to @xmath0 decay data have previously been developed @xcite , the novel approach embedded in our technique is that simultaneous fits to the energy dependence of the angular correlation coefficients allow for a robust test of the validity of the @xmath2 structure of the sm in the presence of theoretical uncertainties , whereas fits based on integral quantities do not . to our knowledge",
    "ours is the first study of the quantitative ability to falsify the sm and particularly the @xmath2 law , after the manner of refs .",
    "@xcite , in the context of neutron beta decay observables .",
    "our study has consisted of fits to the @xmath8 and @xmath10 angular correlation coefficients , as well as to the value of the neutron lifetime .",
    "we believe that studies of the @xmath3 angular correlation coefficient , as well as of @xmath193 through the electron energy spectrum in @xmath0 decay , will offer important complementary information ; and such , as well as any additional , concomitant theoretical uncertainties , can be incorporated in our analysis framework as well . in our current study",
    "we have focused on the role of second - class current contributions , most notably on the impact of a non - zero @xmath75 coupling , on the ability to identify physics bsm . in the course of developing our analysis procedure",
    ", we have discovered that certain recoil effects to the neutron lifetime , contrary to the usual view @xcite , can have an impact on our fit results . moreover , the precise form of the recoil corrections depends on experimental details , revealing that the corrections change with a finite experimental acceptance , such as in experiments which extract a value of the lifetime from measurements of the decay electrons and/or protons .",
    "such considerations warrant further detailed study .",
    "we have explicitly shown that it is possible to _ discover _ physics bsm , at @xmath238 significance , in neutron @xmath0 decay observables using experiments which are _ currently _ planned or under construction .",
    "this is subject to the following conditions ; namely , that ( i ) tensor interactions are not much smaller than the constraint which emerges from the dalitz analysis of pion radiative @xmath0 decay @xcite , ( ii ) the value of @xmath75 can be sharply restricted , and ( iii ) results of 0.03% precision can be realized for @xmath8 and @xmath10 , in concert with a sub-@xmath245 determination of the neutron lifetime .",
    "in our study we have assumed that @xmath246 , so that using @xmath247 @xcite and noting @xmath248 , this would be commensurate with the appearance of physics bsm at an energy scale of at least @xmath249 @xcite .",
    "we note that existing direct limits on tensor couplings from nuclear @xmath0 decay are much weaker than those from radiative pion decay @xcite ; perhaps new physics effects could be different in pion and neutron decays .",
    "we note , however , that under the assumption that bsm effects appear at energies in excess of @xmath250 such effects can only occur from operators beyond mass - dimension six and ought be suppressed .",
    "our current analysis framework is also suitable to the discovery of new scalar interactions as well .",
    "we have shown that theoretical uncertainties in @xmath75 can mitigate the gains made in falsifying the sm through the inclusion of precision @xmath6 results .",
    "we thus advocate for a determination of @xmath75 using lattice gauge theory techniques ; we suppose that lattice measurements of @xmath71 and @xmath74 in neutron decay would be useful , too .",
    "these considerations are quite independent of how information on @xmath193 is determined .",
