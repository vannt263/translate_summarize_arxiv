    "one of the difficulties encountered in modelling self - gravitating systems is set by the potential theory . in general , to calculate the gravitational potential associated with a matter distribution of arbitrary shape , one has to use numerical methods . on the other hand , it is convenient to have a set of analytical potential - density pairs that provide a description of gravitating systems , in particular , for those that deviate from spherical symmetry .",
    "a survey of such models can be found in @xcite , chapter 2 .",
    "a simple way to construct axisymmetric potential - density pairs that represent discs is the image method that is usually used to solve problems in electrostatics .",
    "this method was employed in the context of the newtonian gravity first by kuzmin @xcite , who derived a very simple potential - denstity pair of a disc ( section [ sec_disc ] ) .",
    "several years later , evans & de zeeuw @xcite showed that any axisymmetric disc can be constructed by superposing simple kuzmin discs with different weights .",
    "the image method has also been adapted to and used in general relativity to generate several exact solutions of einstein s equations that represent discs ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "another technique to construct new solutions in the newtonian gravity was introduced by appell @xcite who considered the complexification of the potential of a point mass .",
    "this method , known as _ complex - shift method _",
    ", was also used in general relativity @xcite , but see some misinterpretations in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "more recently , the complex - shift method has been applied to spherical and axisymmetric newtonian parent systems to generate new analytical axisymmetric and triaxial potential - density pairs @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we use the complex - shift method to derive potential - dentity pairs for non - axisymmetric flat discs and rings and their `` inflated '' versions . in section [ sec_complex ] ,",
    "we summarize the method of complexification . in section [ sec_disc ]",
    ", we complex shift the kuzmin - toomre family of discs to derive a family of non - axisymmetric flat discs .",
    "the members of this class are then superposed to generate further non - axisymmetric flat distributions of matter that can be interpreted as complex - shifted rings .",
    "this is done in section [ sec_ring ] . in section [ sec_tri_disc ]",
    ", we use a general transformation to `` inflate '' the previous non - axisymmetric flat systems to generate triaxial potential - density pairs .",
    "we derive a generalized pair that includes an example studied by ciotti & marinacci @xcite . in section [ sec_im ] , we show that the imaginary part of a complex - shifted system can be superposed to another potential - density pair to generate physically acceptable systems which are not symmetrical with respect to a coordinate axis . at last ,",
    "in section [ sec_discuss ] we summarize our results .",
    "in this section , we briefly expose the idea of the complex - shift method .",
    "the formalism is similar to the presented by ciotti & giampieri @xcite and ciotti & marinacci @xcite .",
    "we start by considering a gravitational potential @xmath0 and an associated density distribution @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the position vector .",
    "we also assume that @xmath1 satisfies the poisson equation @xmath3 the basic idea of the complex - shift method is to obtain new potential - density pairs by a displacement of a given potential - density pair ( the parent system ) on the imaginary axis .",
    "the complexified potential is defined as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the imaginary unit and @xmath6 is a real shift vector .",
    "since the complex shift is a linear transformation and the poisson equation is a linear partial differential equation ( pde ) acting on the @xmath7 vector , it follows that @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the shifted mass density . by separating the real and imaginary parts of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , one obtains two real potential - density pairs .",
    "unfortunately , there is no guarantee that the resulting pairs describe physically acceptable ( i.e.  everywhere positive ) gravitating systems .",
    "in fact , ciotti & giampieri @xcite have shown that the imaginary part of the complex - shifted density always changes sign because the total mass of the complexified potential - density pair coincides with the total mass of the seed density distribution , and thus @xmath12 .",
    "however , the real part can be positive everywhere .",
    "this usually happens for a finite domain of the shift vector @xmath6 .",
    "in this section , we apply the complex shift to the kuzmin - toomre family of discs @xcite to generate flat distributions of matter without axial symmetry .",
    "we begin with the first member of this family , which was the simple model derived by kuzmin .",
    "the potential in the usual cylindrical coordinates @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a non - negative parameter .",
    "using poisson equation ( [ eq_poisson ] ) , the discontinuous normal derivative on @xmath16 introduces a surface density of mass @xmath17 which for the potential ( [ eq_phi_kuz ] ) results @xmath18 the result of a complex shift of an axisymmetric potential depends not only on the length but also on the direction of the shift vector @xmath6 .",
    "we are interested in the equatorial shift of the potential ( [ eq_phi_kuz ] ) , where without loss of generality we make a shift along the @xmath19-axis , @xmath20 .",
    "the complexified potential ( [ eq_phi_kuz ] ) reads @xmath21 to evaluate the square root , we denote @xmath22 .",

    "we now use the family of non - axisymmetric thin discs discussed in the previous section to construct structures that can be considered as non - axisymmetric flat rings .",
    "the idea is to use superpositions of different members of the kuzmin - toomre family of discs to generate rings ( zero mass density at the origin ) , as was done recently by vogt & letelier @xcite .",
    "let us briefly recall the main point of that work .",

    "however , consider a shift @xmath65 and evaluate the resulting complex density at the origin .",
    "we get @xmath66 which is non - zero and even negative when @xmath67 is odd .",
    "this indicates that in order to generate non - axisymmetric ring structures we should consider the superposition of complex - shifted kuzmin - toomre discs .",
    "we go back and apply a shift to equation ( [ eq_sigma_ad ] ) , evaluate it at @xmath68 , @xmath69 and write the superposition @xmath70 now we impose the condition that the sum ( [ eq_sum_2 ] ) be zero . noting that @xmath71^{m - k } \\left ( 1- \\frac{a^2}{b^2 } \\right)^k= \\left ( -1+\\frac{a^2}{b^2}+1-\\frac{a^2}{b^2 } \\right)^m=0 \\mbox{,}\\ ] ] and comparing with ( [ eq_sum_2 ] ) , we get @xmath72 if we denote the surface density of the _ _ n__th - order shifted kuzmin - toomre disc by @xmath73 , then the superposition @xmath74 will be the equivalent to complex - shifted `` rings '' with zero surface density at the origin , and if @xmath75 the superposition reduces to the sum ( [ eq_sigma_sum ] ) .",

    "<S> the complex - shift method is applied to the kuzmin - toomre family of discs to generate a family of non - axisymmetric flat distributions of matter . </S>",
    "<S> these are then superposed to construct non - axisymmetric flat rings . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider triaxial potential - density pairs obtained from these non - axisymmetric flat systems by means of suitable transformations . the use of the imaginary part of complex - shifted potential - density pairs is also discussed .    _ </S>",
