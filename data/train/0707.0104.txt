    "it is generally believed that the pairing necessary for high-@xmath3 superconductivity in cuprates involves the interplay between doped charges and antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin correlation . in this sense , the study of lightly doped , insulating af state is important to understand the pairing mechanism because density of the carriers can be sufficiently low so that the interaction between them is small relative to their interaction with @xmath4 spins .",

    "such giant anisotropy in resistivity induced just by changing b direction within @xmath0 plane should be related to the magnetic structure and magnetic moment induced by b because the magnetic field along cu - o - cu or cu - cu just changes the spin structure and induces the different magnitude of the magnetic moment . to understand the jump in mr with b close to the cu - o - cu direction , the mr at 5 k is measured with rotating b in clockwise direction and in anti - clockwise direction , respectively .",

    "therefore , the fourfold symmetry in magnetization and the jump in magnetization are related to the magnetic structure of nd@xmath2 .",
    "in the other hand , the fourfold symmetry shown in fig.5 indicates a magnetic ordering of nd@xmath2 .",
    "the spontaneous ordering of the nd@xmath2 subsystem at low temperature due to nd@xmath2-nd@xmath2 interaction remains controversial .",

    "recently , an abnormal peak around 5 k observed in ultrasonic measurement is explained to be somehow related to local magnetic domains@xcite .",
    "since the nd@xmath2-cu@xmath11 and nd@xmath2-nd@xmath2 interactions are opposite , the former is dominated above 5 k and makes nd@xmath2 parallel to cu@xmath11 as shown in fig.8(a ) , while the later is dominated below 5 k and makes nd@xmath2 prefer to be perpendicular to cu@xmath11 as shown in fig.8(b ) . due to the frustration of the nd@xmath2 magnetic subsystem arising from the competition between nd@xmath2-cu@xmath11 and nd@xmath2-nd@xmath2 interaction , the local magnetic domain is formed with",
    "nd@xmath2 not parallel to cu@xmath11 magnetic moment below 5 k. the magnetic structure of nd@xmath2 subsystem with magnetic moment of nd@xmath2 perpendicular to cu@xmath11 can be stabilized by the external field .",
    "the observed fourfold symmetry below 5k in magnetization could arise from the reorientation of nd@xmath2 spin .",
    "richard et al . have given evidence that the magnetic structure below 5 k has anisotropic field - dependence@xcite .",
    "as shown in fig.7 , the field dependent magnetization of x=0.025 sample at 2 k shows an anomaly at 0.6 t and 3.6 t for both cu - cu and cu - o - cu directions , respectively .",
    "however , no such anisotropy is observed above 5 k. to make the anisotropy clear , the magnetization at 2 k subtracted the 5 k magnetization is shown in fig.7(b ) .",
    "such anomaly has been attributed to spin - reorientation of nd@xmath2 in nd@xmath9cuo@xmath10@xcite .",

    "similar result has been reported in nd@xmath34cuo@xmath10@xcite .",
    "recently , a crossover from antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic configuration induced by high magnetic field is proposed by richard et al.@xcite .",

    "as shown in fig.2 and fig.6 , the giant anisotropy in mr below 5 k coincides with the magnetic ordering of nd@xmath2 with the same fourfold symmetry .",
    "these results indicate that the fourfold symmetry of mr results from spin ordering of @xmath4 , and the spin ordering of nd@xmath2 enhances the fourfold symmetry in mr below 5 k and leads to a giant anisotropy in mr .",
    "it is evident that the jump of out - of - plane mr with b along cu - o - cu direction shown in fig.2 is related to the sudden change in magnetization shown in the inset of fig.5 . therefore , the change of mr below 5 k relative to high temperature mr can be mainly ascribed to the ordering of nd@xmath2 spin .",

    "but the fitting parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 show a systematic change with increasing external field as listed in table 1 .",
    "change of the scaling behavior is closely related to the change of magnetic structure of nd@xmath2 induced by external field since the increase of external field from 6 t to 12 t can not lead to change of magnetic structure of @xmath4 subsystem .",
    "it is supported by the fact that the change of in - plane mr with increasing magnetic field is much smaller than that of out - of - plane mr , and the anisotropy of out - of - plane mr is much larger than that of in - plane mr as shown in fig.2 .",
    "richard et al.,@xcite pointed out that the magnetic structure of nd@xmath2 subsystem can change from antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic configuration at certain critical magnetic field .",
    "it is possible that the evolution of scaling parameters listed in table 1 is related to the change of magnetic structure of nd@xmath2 .",
    "it is well known that the neighboring @xmath0 plane with antiferromagnetic configuration is separated by nd - o layer.@xcite as discussed above , the magnetic structure of nd@xmath2 subsystem can be turned by external field . therefore , the out - of - plane transport can be switched by magnetic field assuming the nd - o layer as a barrier . in this sense , this phenomenon can be well understood with `` spin valve '' effect .",
    "the magnetic excitations are different with b along cu - cu and cu - o - cu directions because the magnetic structure is more frustrated around cu - o - cu@xcite . in `` spin valve",
    "'' picture , the different magnetic excitations in nd@xmath2 layer lead to different transport along c - axis . therefore , the spin - flop transition is the key to understand the giant anisotropy of out - of - plane mr .",
    "thermal conductivity results indicate that in - plane magnetic field can result in a close of anisotropic gap ( @xmath12 0.3mev ) which leads to additional heat conduction@xcite .",
    "the critical magnetic field is about 4.5 t and 2.5 t in cu - o - cu and cu - cu direction , respectively .",
    "the closure of anisotropic gap corresponds to spin - flop transition for cu@xmath11 spin .",
    "this result indicates that the spin - flop transition can lead to a closure of anisotropic gap . at low temperature below 5 k",
    ", another gap related to spin - flop transition of nd@xmath2 is closed under high magnetic field and this gap is anisotropic .",
    "the gap can be estimated with b=@xmath38/g@xmath39@xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , the gap is about 0.5 mev with magnetic field along cu - o - cu direction .",
    "this spin - flop should originate from nd@xmath2 subsystem because magnons from @xmath4 have energy above 5 mev@xcite , and four optical nd magnon branches lie in the range 0.2 to 0.8 mev@xcite .",
    "the study on magnetic structure under high magnetic field at low temperature is lacking .",
    "this picture needs further experimental investigation to confirm .",
    "these results give a strong evidence that a nontrivial correlation between charge and af ordering background exists , the charge transport can be affected not only by cu@xmath11 spins but also nd@xmath2 spins , especially below 5 k.    the huge changes in resistivities as induced by the in - plane magnetic field seem to be a highly nontrivial phenomenon .",
    "note that the applied in - plane magnetic field should only affect the spins of the system via the zeeman effect without directly influencing the orbital motion of charge carriers in the in - plane case , and presumably with only a weak orbital effect for the out - of - plane case as the resistivity itself is divergent at low temperature .",
    "it thus implies the existence of some kind of strong  entanglement \" between the spin and charge degrees of freedom such that by tuning the magnetic ordering with an in - plane magnetic field can result in a big enhancement of resistivities seen in the measurements .",
    "furthermore , the large mr behavior in this insulating regime also strongly suggests that the divergence of resistivities at low - temperature may not be simply a conventional localization effect due to disorders since spin structures can affect resisitivities so much .",
    "although the microscopic mechanism remains unclear , the novel spin - charge entanglement does exist in strongly correlated models .",
    "for example , in the t - j model , a so - called phase string effect has been shown @xcite to be present as a non - local mutual frustration between the charge and spin degrees of freedom induced by doped charge carriers moving in an antiferromanget .",
    "in fact , the localization of the charge carriers in the magnetic ordered phase has been interpreted@xcite based on such a phase string effect and it is thus conceivable that the change of the spin structure may strongly affect the resistivities via the phase string effect .",
    "the scaling between in - plane and out - of - plane mr is strongly dependent on spin structure of nd@xmath2 which emerges at low temperature since strong cu@xmath11-nd@xmath2 interaction and can be easily tuned by external magnetic field .",
    "it provides a good chance to show a evidence for the spin - charge entanglement .",
    "in this paper , we study anisotropic magnetoresistance ( mr ) and magnetization with rotating magnetic field ( b ) within @xmath0 plane in lightly doped af @xmath1 . _ a giant anisotropy _ in mr",
    "is observed , and the c - axis resistivity can be tuned by about one order of magnitude just with changing b direction .",
    "these results provide evidence to support the spin - flop transition of nd@xmath2 ions induced by high magnetic field .",
    "the change of magnetic structure induced by different external field leads to a systematic evolution of the scaling behavior between in - plane and out - of - plane mr .",
    "`` spin valve '' effect is used to well understand the out - of - plane mr behavior .",

    "<S> we have studied anisotropic magnetoresistance ( mr ) and magnetization with rotating magnetic field ( b ) within @xmath0 plane in lightly doped af @xmath1 . _ a giant anisotropy _ in mr </S>",
    "<S> is observed at low temperature below 5 k. the c - axis resistivity can be tuned about one order of magnitude just by changing b direction within @xmath0 plane and a scaling behavior between out - of - plane and in - plane mr is found . </S>",
    "<S> a `` spin valve '' effect is proposed to understand the giant anisotropy of out - of - plane mr and the evolution of scaling parameters with the external field . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the field - induced spin - flop transition of nd@xmath2 layer under high magnetic field is the key to understand the giant anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that a novel entanglement between charge and spin dominates the underlying physics . </S>"
