    "the study of how order arises in nature is in the center of interest in several areas of physics , especially in thermodynamics and statistical physics .",
    "a special focus is on the question , how order can emerge , even in or due to the presence of quenched disorder .",
    "one type of system , which has attracted a lot of attention during the last decades , are spin glasses@xcite .    in this work",
    ", the transition from one ordered phase , the ferromagnetic phase , to another ordered phase , the spin - glass phase , is studied for a four - dimensional random - bond ising model .",
    "the model is studied by means of ground - state calculations , using the _ genetic cluster - exact approximation ( cea ) _ method .",
    "this approach has the advantage that one does not encounter ergodicity problems or critical slowing down like when using algorithms which are based on monte - carlo methods . to the author s knowledge ,",
    "there are no numerical studies of the four - dimensional random - bond ising model ( except at @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , for two@xcite and three@xcite dimensions , the random - bond ising model has been studied numerically at @xmath8 already , resulting in critical values @xmath9 for square lattices respectively @xmath10 for cubic lattices .",
    "the model treated here consists of @xmath11 ising spins @xmath12 on a hypercubic lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes a sum over pair of nearest neighbors .",
    "systems with quenched disorder of the bonds @xmath15 are studied .",
    "the ferromagnetic - spin glass transition is driven by increasing the fraction @xmath16 of antiferromagnetic ( @xmath17 ) ( af ) bonds . for low concentration @xmath16 ,",
    "the system is ferromagnetically ordered , while for intermediate values of @xmath16 , spin - glass order arises . for very high concentration",
    ", the system shows af ordering .",
    "=    in previous work , the model has been studied using high - temperature series expansions@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figphasediagram ] the schematic phase diagram is presented .",
    "the line connecting the multicritical point @xmath18 with @xmath19 starts vertically@xcite at the multicritical point .",
    "therefore , @xmath20 can be expected .",
    "the values previously obtained for the concentration at the multicritical point are @xmath21 ( ref . ) , @xmath22 ( ref . ) and @xmath23 ( ref . ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : next , the algorithm to generate spin - glass ground states in four dimensions is briefly explained .",
    "then , the results describing the ferromagnetic - spin glass transition are presented and finally a summary is given .",
    "from the computational point of view , the calculation of spin - glass ground states is very demanding , because it belongs to the class of the np - hard problems @xcite .",
    "this means that only algorithms are available , for which the running time on a computer increases exponentially with the system size . only for the special case of a planar system without magnetic field , e.g. a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions in at most one direction ,",
    "exist efficient polynomial - time `` matching '' algorithms@xcite .    for higher dimensions ,",
    "one must rely on exact methods like branch - and - bound @xcite or branch - and - cut@xcite , which are able to treat only small systems .",
    "for that reason , recently some heuristics have been introduced . by using a hierarchical approach@xcite",
    "one can calculate true ground states in four dimensions up to size @xmath24 , while for @xmath25 it is not clear whether true ground states were found@xcite .",
    "the method applied here@xcite , is able to calculate ground - states in four dimensions up to size @xmath26 .",
    "the technique is based on a special genetic algorithm @xcite and on cluster - exact approximation @xcite which is an optimization method designed especially for spin glasses .",
    "now a brief description of the techniques are given .",
    "genetic algorithms are biologically motivated .",
    "an optimal solution is found by treating many instances of the problem in parallel , keeping only better instances and replacing bad ones by new ones ( survival of the fittest ) .",
    "the genetic algorithm starts with an initial population of @xmath27 randomly initialized spin configurations (= _ individuals _ ) , which are linearly arranged in a ring .",
    "then @xmath28 times two neighbors from the population are taken ( called _ parents _ ) and two _ offspring _ are created using the so called triadic crossover @xcite .",
    "then a mutation with a rate of @xmath29 is applied to each offspring , i.e. a fraction @xmath29 of the spins is reversed .",
    "next , for both offspring the energy is reduced by applying the cea .",
    "this algorithm constructs iteratively and randomly a non - frustrated cluster of spins , whereas spins with many unsatisfied bonds are more likely to be added to the cluster .",
    "the non - cluster spins act like local magnetic fields on the cluster spins .",
    "for the spins of the cluster , an energetic minimum state can be calculated in polynomial time by using graph - theoretical methods @xcite : an equivalent network is constructed @xcite , the maximum flow is calculated @xcite and the spins of the cluster are set to the orientations leading to a minimum in energy .",
    "this minimization step is performed @xmath30 times for each offspring .    afterwards each offspring is compared with one of its parents .",
    "the pairs are chosen in the way that the sum of the phenotypic differences between them is minimal .",
    "the phenotypic difference is defined here as the number of spins where the two configurations differ .",
    "each parent is replaced if its energy is not lower ( i.e. better ) than the corresponding offspring .",
    "after this creation of offspring has been performed @xmath28 times , the population is halved : from each pair of neighbors the configuration which has the higher energy is eliminated .",
    "if not more than 4 individuals remain , the process is stopped and the best individual is taken as result of the calculation .",
    "the whole algorithm is performed @xmath31 times and all final configurations which exhibit the lowest energy are stored , resulting in @xmath32 statistical independent ground - state configurations . by comparison with an exact method , it was shown@xcite that genetic cea , with an appropriate choice of the parameters ( @xmath27 , @xmath33 , @xmath30 , @xmath29 ) , indeed calculates true ground states .",
    "the probability that a certain ground - state configuration is found by this method is not equal for all ground states @xcite , i.e. the algorithm imposes a bias . in this work",
    ", the magnetization is the main quantity of interest . to test , how large the influence of this bias is , for @xmath25 , @xmath34 , where fluctuations of the magnetization are the largest , 64 realizations were considered . for each realization , ( biased ) ground states were generated using 200 independent runs .",
    "next , for each realization a ( thermodynamically correct ) set of ground states was generated in such a way that each configuration contributes with the same probability@xcite .",
    "for both sets of ground states the magnetization was evaluated . for the biased set",
    "an average value of @xmath35 was obtained , while the correct thermodynamic result is @xmath36 .",
    "this shows that the influence of the bias on the result of the magnetization is small .",
    "please note that that is in contrast to other quantities like the distribution @xmath37 of overlaps : the overlap @xmath38 between two independent ground states @xmath39 , @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 .",
    "when measuring the fraction @xmath42 of small overlaps , one obtains an average value @xmath43 for the biased set of states , while the from the correct thermodynamic treatment one obtains quite a different result @xmath44 .",
    "hence , when restricting the measurement to quantities depending solely on the magnetization , it is sufficient to use the biased data .",
    "this allows much shorter running times , because only few ground states per realization are needed .",
    "with the genetic cluster - exact approximation , it it possible@xcite to obtain ground - states for four - dimensional systems up to @xmath26 . since the study of the transition involves the calculation of a binder cumulant , it is necessary to average over many samples of the disorder .",
    "for that reason , only sizes @xmath45 were considered in this work .",
    "a mutation rate of @xmath46 was used .",
    "the other simulation parameters are shown in tab .",
    "i.    .simulation parameters : @xmath47 = system size , @xmath27 = initial size of population , @xmath33 = average number of offspring per configuration , @xmath30 = number of cea minimization steps per offspring , @xmath48 = typical computer time per ground state on a 80mhz ppc601 , @xmath49 = total number of realizations of the random variables . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     systems with concentrations of the antiferromagnetic bonds in the range @xmath50 $ ] were treated . for each realization @xmath51 independent runs were performed .",
    "the resulting ground - state energy as a function of the parameter @xmath16 is shown in fig .",
    "[ figenergy ] for different system sizes . for small concentrations @xmath16 , the ground state is mainly ferromagnetic .",
    "it follows that all the af bonds are not satisfied , so the ground state energy increases linearly with @xmath16 like @xmath52 . for larger concentrations ,",
    "the ground - state energy approaches the @xmath7 limit . with increasing @xmath47 the ground state energy decreases , because the periodic boundary conditions impose less constraints on the system . for @xmath53 and @xmath7",
    "a ground state energy of @xmath54 was found@xcite .",
    "=    from fig .",
    "[ figenergy ] is clear that the energy as function of concentration is not a suitable quantity for determining the critical concentration @xmath55 , where the ferromagnetic behavior disappears . for this purpose the binder cumulant @xcite @xmath56_j } { [ \\langle m^2\\rangle]_j^2}\\right)\\ ] ] for the magnetization @xmath57",
    "is evaluated . the average @xmath58 denotes the average over different ground states of a realization , while @xmath59_j$ ] is the average over the disorder . in fig .",
    "[ figbinder ] the binder cumulant is shown for @xmath60 . to keep the figure clear , only the largest error bar is shown .",
    "all curves intersect near @xmath61 .",
    "because of the huge numerical effort , the simulations are restricted to small system sizes , which prevents a more accurate result .    only few studies concerning the four - dimensional random - bond model",
    "have been performed before . using high - temperature series expansions for the location of the multicritical point @xmath18 , values of @xmath21 ( ref . ) , @xmath22 ( ref . ) and @xmath23 ( ref . )",
    "were determined .",
    "these results compare well with the value of @xmath55 obtained here , indicating that the the line connecting @xmath62 with @xmath18 is vertical , or nearly so , as expected@xcite .",
    "=    for the binder cumulant the following finite - size scaling relation is assumed @xcite    @xmath63    by plotting @xmath64 against @xmath65 with correct parameters @xmath66 the datapoints for different system sizes should collapse onto a single curve near @xmath67 .",
    "the best results were obtained for @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in fig .",
    "[ figbinderscale ] the resulting scaling plot is shown .",
    "it is possible to change the value of @xmath33 in a wide range without large effects on the scaling plot .",
    "thus , here a value of @xmath70 is estimated .",
    "this is compatible with the value @xmath71 found by a high - temperature series expansion@xcite at the multicritical point .",
    "although there is no direct correspondence between the @xmath8 ferromagnetic - spin glass transition and the finite temperature ( @xmath7 ) paramagnetic - spin glass transition at @xmath72 , it is remarkable that by monte - carlo simulations@xcite of four - dimensional spin glasses near @xmath73 a similar value of @xmath3 was found . finally , it should be pointed out , that the result given above is not compatible with the corresponding exponent for four - dimensional bond percolation@xcite of @xmath5 .    =    in fig .",
    "[ figmag ] the behavior of the average magnetization @xmath74_j$ ] is shown as a function of @xmath16 for different system sizes .",
    "=    this quantity has the standard finite - size scaling form @xcite @xmath75 by plotting @xmath76 against @xmath65 with correct parameters @xmath77 the datapoints for different system sizes should collapse onto a single curve near @xmath67 .",
    "the best result was obtained using @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath78 .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ figmagscale ] for @xmath60 . from variations of the value @xmath79 ,",
    "the value of the exponent @xmath4 is estimated .",
    "again , this values significantly differs from the exponent @xmath80 found@xcite for the order parameter of the four - dimensional bond - percolation .",
    "the ferromagnetic - spin glass transition of the four - dimensional random - bond ising model was studied at @xmath8 using ground - state calculations .",
    "the genetic cluster - exact approximation method was applied .",
    "because of the high computational effort , only small systems of size @xmath81 could be studied .",
    "since the ground - state problem is np - hard , it is very unlikely that significantly larger sizes can be studied in the near future .    by evaluating the binder cumulant , a critical concentration of @xmath2",
    "was found , which is comparable to values which were obtained by high - temperature series expansions .    using a finite - size scaling analysis ,",
    "the critical exponents for the divergence of the correlation length @xmath3 and for the magnetization @xmath4 were determined .",
    "hence , the transition is clearly in a different universality class than four - dimensional bond percolation .",
