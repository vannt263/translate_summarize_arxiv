    "the theoretical interpretation of the properties of glasses is highly debated .",
    "there are two extreme viewpoints :    * one approach , the random first order transition ( rfot ) theory @xcite , which uses mostly the replica method @xcite as its central tool , assumes that the dynamical properties of glasses do reflect the properties of the appropriate static quantities ( like the franz - parisi potential @xcite ) : for a review see @xcite . *",
    "the other approach ( kinetically constrained models , ( kcms ) assumes that the glass transition is a purely dynamical phenomenon without any counterpart in static quantities @xcite .    the mean field version the rfot approach predicts the presence of a _ dynamical transition _ ( identified with the mode - coupling transition @xcite ) at a nonzero temperature @xmath0 , whereupon the configuration space of the glass - former splits into a collection of metastable states .",
    "below @xmath0 , the system will remain trapped inside a metastable state . beyond mean field theory the dynamical transition @xmath0 becomes a cross over point : at @xmath0 the correlation time and the dynamical correlation length become very large , but finite . below the @xmath0",
    "the dynamical correlation time becomes very large and it becomes comparable to the human timescales , leading to the phenomenological glass transition . in the kcm approach the glass transition is a phenomenon originated only by constraints on the dynamics , while the rfot picture views the off equilibrium states as metastable , _ thermodynamic states _ , they can be identified with the minima of a suitable _ equilibrium _ free - energy functional and can then be studied using a modified equilibrium formalism , generally built on the replica method .    according to replica formalism",
    ", the system explores the whole collection of possible states , with lower and lower free - energy , as the temperature is lowered from @xmath0 to another temperature @xmath1 ( the kauzmann temperature ) where the states with the lowest free energy are reached .",
    "most rfot models ( but actually not all , since @xmath2 for some models ) predict then an equilibrium phase transition at @xmath1 , with a real divergence of the relaxation time .    to test this scenario ,",
    "it would be necessary to perform experiments and simulations at various temperatures in this range , but then one must face the problem of equilibrating the glass - former at temperatures @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the phenomenological glass transition temperature ) , where it is by definition impossible to do so . indeed , a simple estimate shows that the increase of the equilibration time below @xmath0 is so sharp that one can not get nearer to @xmath1 than @xmath5 without falling out of equilibrium , making for us impossible to get a good look at the lowest states : only the high free - energy states near @xmath0 can be probed experimentally .    some progress in this direction has been made recently both in experiments @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite , with the introduction of the so - called vapor deposition technique , which allows one to obtain extraordinarily stable glasses ( usually referred to as ultrastable glasses @xcite ) in a relatively short time , even for temperatures much lower than @xmath0 .",
    "first numerical simulations on an ultrastable glass of binary lennard - jones mixture seem to support the existence of a thermodynamic phase transition @xcite . on the theoretical side",
    ", the intrinsic out - of - equilibrium nature of glass poses another challenge , since the methods of equilibrium statistical mechanics can not be used in the usual way , requiring , in principle , to resort to dynamical tools .",
    "this strategy is actually viable , and was used for example by keys et .",
    "al in @xcite , where a suitably tuned east - model has been shown to reproduce well the experimental behavior observed in dsc ( differential scanning calorimetry ) experiments on different glass - former materials , for example the glycerol @xcite and the boron oxide @xcite .",
    "this approach however has the drawback of being phenomenological in nature .",
    "the recent introduction @xcite of a semi - realistic soluble model for glasses ( the mari - kurchan model , mk ) gives us the possibility to address both the equilibration and the theoretical problem .",
    "it allows us to obtain equilibrated configurations also beyond the dynamical transition and deep into the glass phase , using the so - called _ planting _",
    "method @xcite . moreover , it is in principle solvable in the replica method , allowing us to study the metastable glassy states with a _ static _",
    "formalism , without having to solve the dynamics .",
    "our aim is to use this model to simulate slow annealing experiments usually performed on glasses and ultrastable glasses , in order to compare the numerical outcomes with experimental results and theoretical predictions in the replica method .",
    "we consider the potential energy of the family of models introduced by mari and kurchan ( mk model ) @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 are @xmath8 @xmath9-dimensional vectors , representing particles positions , and the particles move in a @xmath9 dimensional cube or size @xmath10 , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the main feature of the model are the variables @xmath11 : they are @xmath12 quenched random vectors , called _ random shifts _ , independently drawn out from an uniform probability distribution inside the cube .",
    "the function @xmath13 could be in principle any interesting short - ranged repulsive pairwise interaction .",
    "the main effects of the random shifts is to destroy the direct correlation among the particles that interact with a given particle @xcite .",
    "this makes the computation of static quantities very simple , because in the mayer expansion of the grand - canonical potential only the tree diagrams survive in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "the idea is quite old @xcite , it had important application to turbulence , but it has only recently been applied to glasses",
    ".      here we will summarise analytical and numerical results obtained by mari and kurchan for this model . in the following @xmath14",
    "will denote the diameter of spheres .",
    "in hard - sphere systems the potential @xmath15 is infinite at distances less the @xmath14 and the role of inverse temperature is played by the _ packing fraction _ @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the volume of the @xmath9-dimensional sphere of diameter @xmath14 ; we will call it density absorbing the multiplicative factor in its definition .",
    "the hamiltonian contains random terms and the interesting quantities have then to be averaged over these parameters .",
    "we can define the _ annealed _ entropy @xmath18 and the _ quenched _ entropy @xmath19 given by @xmath20 the computation of @xmath18 can be easily done and one finds @xmath21 the presence of the @xmath22 term is due to the fact that in this model particles are distinguishable for a given realisation of random shifts .",
    "a more interesting quantity is the _ quenched _ entropy . in this model",
    "one finds that @xmath23 in the liquid phase , i.e. below the kauzmann transition density @xmath24 .",
    "the kauzmann transition is avoided in the thermodynamic limit : the total entropy @xmath25 grows as @xmath22 while the vibrational entropy is a non - decreasing function of @xmath26 that diverges in the infinite - density limit .",
    "this implies that the configurational entropy contains a term proportional to @xmath27 and thus the value @xmath28 where the configurational entropy vanishes diverges logarithmically in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "using standard termodynamic relations one can derive from the liquid - phase equilibrium equation of state @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the pressure .    for what concerns the radial distribution function ,",
    "one has to take the random shifts into account : @xmath31 where the bracket average is computed using the ensemble distribution function ( gibbs - boltzmann distribution at equilibrium ) while the bar average is computed using the random shifts probability distribution .",
    "the result is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the usual heaviside step function .",
    "this result is the same obtained with high dimensional hard - spheres @xcite , but the mean - field nature of the model has allowed us to get it in any number of spatial dimensions .",
    "the equilibrium pressure is related to density by the usual relation for hard spheres @xcite @xmath34 from which , using , the equilibrium equation of state can be derived again .",
    "the model is interesting because in spite of the extreme simplicity of the statics ( a feature that it has in common with facilitated models ) the dynamics is extremely complex . at high densities",
    "there is glass phase that in the thermodynamic limit is separated from the liquid phase by a mode coupling transition .",
    "this transition exists only if we embed the model in a space with an infinite number of dimensions @xmath9 ; when @xmath35 , hopping effects destroy the transition which becomes only a crossover region @xcite .",
    "+ accurate simulations @xcite give an higher value for the mode - coupling dynamical density , i.e. @xmath36 . a more careful analysis of the properties of the system near the putative mode - coupling transition can be found in @xcite , where the effects of hopping are carefully studied .",
    "other features , like a violation of stokes - einstein relation and dynamical heterogeneities , are present in this model @xcite .",
    "when a glass is gradually heated during dsc experiments thermodynamic quantities , like the internal energy , continue to follow the glassy behavior also in the liquid phase , until the so - called onset temperature @xmath37 is reached . for @xmath38",
    "the system gradually approaches equilibrium ; during this relaxation process the specific heat reaches a maximum value , higher than the equilibrium one .",
    "the value of @xmath37 quantifies the stability of the initial glass and is considerably higher for glasses prepared through the vapour deposition technique than ordinary glasses aged for many months @xcite .",
    "the vapour deposition procedure has been recently mimicked by a computer algorithm , and numerical simulations over a lennard - jones binary mixture showed the same behavior @xcite .",
    "we aim to study numerically this deviation from equilibrium in the liquid region and the subsequent relaxation process in the mk model . in the mk model",
    "we are able to obtain equilibrium configurations beyond the dynamic transition via a special procedure , allowed only by the presence of random shifts , the so - called _ planting _ @xcite method . basically planting consists in two steps : the generation of a random configuration of sphere positions , independently drawn out from the uniform distribution over the volume , and the generation of the random shifts configuration @xmath39 so that the non - overlap condition imposed by the hard - sphere potential energy is satisfied for every pair of spheres ( see si for all details ) .",
    "the mean - field nature of the interaction guarantees that planted configurations are equilibrated @xcite .",
    "the planted glass in the mk model , like vapour - deposited ultrastable glasses in real world , is the best possible starting point for the study of the deviation from equilibrium in the liquid phase .",
    "we start from a planted configuration and mimic respectively heating in dsc experiments on our hard - sphere system by running adiabatic step - wise decompression scans , where the system performs jumps between different density values and a large number of monte carlo steps for each density value , in order to reach thermalisation .",
    "we refer to si for all other simulation details .",
    "we present now the results of numerical simulations , based on monte carlo method , of a system composed by @xmath40 spheres of diameter @xmath41 in @xmath42 dimensions , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the outcome of the planting technique is a thermalized initial configuration at a certain density @xmath43 .",
    "we discuss now the effects a density jump @xmath44 on @xmath45 , where @xmath46 ( decompression ) .",
    "results for @xmath47 and @xmath48 are shown in fig .",
    "[ rdf_times ] . when spheres radius is decreased , particles originally in contact separate , causing a drop of @xmath45 in the contact region @xmath49 .",
    "while the system evolves at the new density value @xmath50 , gradually particles return in contact , causing the filling of the contact zone . in the glass phase",
    "this filling can only be partial for realizable time scales . in the liquid region and for densities sufficiently far from the dynamical transition , it is possible to see a complete filling .",
    "we consider now the following decompression protocol : we start from a planted configuration at @xmath47 , we jump to @xmath51 and wait @xmath52 steps , then we jump to @xmath53 and we wait again @xmath52 steps , then @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in fig .",
    "[ g1_vs_k ] it is shown the temporal behaviour of @xmath56 for various values of @xmath57 .",
    "we do not see structural relaxation for @xmath58 ( liquid phase ) : the system , after a partial , fast relaxation process reaches the metastable plateau and it has not enough time to escape . when @xmath59 , the lifetime of the original metastable state is smaller than @xmath52 steps and we observe a clear structural relaxation , corresponding to the complete filling of the contact zone .     between the excess pressure @xmath60 and the equilibrium value @xmath61 for various @xmath57 values in the liquid phase , for the decompression protocol with @xmath47 , @xmath51 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "we do not show the curves for @xmath62 ( planted configuration , @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 , not comparable with @xmath65 because the system reaches @xmath66 after a larger density jump . only for @xmath59 we can observe a clear sign of structural relaxation , while for higher densities",
    "the system remains trapped in the original metastable state.[g1_vs_k ] ]      to study the behaviour of the relaxation time as a function of density in the liquid phase and evaluate the dynamic glass transition density @xmath67 , we turn our attention to another observable , the mean square displacement @xmath68 ( msd ) of spheres from their initial positions : @xmath69 since we are interested only in relaxation time , we start from a thermalised configuration at @xmath47 and we jump directly to the density value @xmath57 we are studying .",
    "we stress that in equation @xmath70 is physical position of sphere @xmath71 immediately after the density jump .",
    "we let the system evolve for @xmath72 steps at this density @xmath57 .",
    "for @xmath73 , as expected in a glassy system not too far from its dynamical glass transition , we can observe a two - steps relaxation process .",
    "the system reaches a metastable plateau after about @xmath74 steps , then remains trapped in it for long time , after which it escapes . for each value of density",
    "we fitted the msd s escape from the plateau with a power law function and obtained a value of the relaxation time ( see si for all details ) .",
    "we fitted the resulting curve of @xmath75 as a function of @xmath57 , displayed in fig .",
    "[ relaxation ] , with the power law behaviour @xmath76 , obtaining in this way @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "one can notice that the value for @xmath79 is not too different from the one obtained in @xcite performing a similar analysis on the relaxation time , while the value of @xmath80 is definitely smaller than @xmath67 , but not too far from the one obtained in @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ g1phi_variousk ] we represent the behaviour of the _ reduced pressure @xmath81 _ as a function of density for a decompression protocol with starting density @xmath47 and a constant density - jump amplitude @xmath82 .",
    "we have different curves for different values of the number @xmath72 of montecarlo steps performed at each density value .",
    "we see a deviation from equilibrium independent from the decompression rate for sufficiently high @xmath57 . for values well above @xmath67 , for example @xmath83",
    ", the system is in the glass phase , so relaxation takes place inside the original metastable state and pressure deviates from its equilibrium value .",
    "this deviation continues for the largest density values below @xmath67 , for example @xmath84 : the system continues to relax inside the original metastable state , having yet no sufficient time to reach equilibrium .",
    "when density is sufficiently low , the lifetime of the original metastable state becomes smaller than @xmath72 and the onset of relaxation towards equilibrium takes place .",
    "the relatively sharp pressure reclimb is dependent on decompression rate , and it is faster for slower rates .    the decompression protocol adopted for our system , composed by hard spheres , is equivalent to the typical dsc s heating scans , with two crucial differences : ( a ) in dsc experiments we move toward the glassy phase by decreasing the temperature : in the case of hard spheres the inverse of the density plays the same role of the temperature .",
    "( b ) the starting configurations of the dynamics are fully equilibrated and this corresponds only to the case of dsc with infinitely slow cooling speed and relatively fast heating speed .",
    "the observed deviation of pressure from equilibrium for @xmath73 is qualitatively the same phenomenon typically observed in dsc experiments .",
    "one point is important to notice : in dsc experimental heating data the relaxation toward equilibrium for @xmath38 is gradual and smooth @xcite , internal energy and enthalpy are continous at the onset point and the specific heat gradually reaches its maximum value , while in fig .",
    "[ g1phi_variousk ] the reclimbing of pressure seems relatively sharp , probably signaling an underlying singularity ( with infinite compressibility ) .     in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] curves for different values of @xmath80 are represented , corresponding to different metastable states .",
    "the performed scans start from a planted configuration , corresponding to a point on the equilibrium line , and lead the system to a pressure lower than the equilibrium value during decompression .",
    "as expected , during decompression the relaxation of pressure towards equilibrium is sharp and it starts at a lower onset density the higher is @xmath80 , i.e. the more stable is the original glassy configuration : the system has memory of the inital state of the glass ( _ hysteresis _ ) .",
    "this effect is analogous to what is observed in ultrastable real glasses @xcite : the more stable is the initial glass obtained via vapour deposition , the longer is the deviation from equilibrium in the liquid phase and , as a result , the higher is the onset temperature .",
    "when we compress the system ( only from @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] ) , we see that the pressure becomes higher than the equilibrium one , as expected .",
    "this effect mirrors what happens in decompression and the two sets of data concerning decompression and compression scans from @xmath47 join smoothly , as expected .",
    "so far we have shown how the mk model allows to prepare the system in a glass state , even at densities much higher that the dynamical one , without incurring in the problem of extremely large equilibration times .",
    "in addition , this model has another remarkable advantage : it is in principle solvable , thanks to its mean - field nature : the interaction network is tree - like ( or alternatively without loops ) in the thermodynamic limit , like in van der waals liquids @xcite , and thus it also allows for a ready comparison between numerics and analytic computations .",
    "in particular , it allows us to perform computations in the replica method .",
    "although the mk model is soluble , it actual analytic solution is exceedingly complex @xcite , so we have to resort to make some approximation : here we assume that the cages have a gaussian shape @xcite .",
    "in the replica approach to the glass transition @xcite , it is assumed that for densities @xmath85 the configuration space can be unambigously splitted in subsets , denoted as metastable glassy states .",
    "these states are theoretically identified with the local minima of a suitable functional , which plays in this context the same role of the thouless - anderson - palmer ( tap ) free energy in spin glasses @xcite . in a mean field situation and in the thermodynamic limit , where metastable states live forever",
    ", the system becomes then immediately trapped in one of these states and fails permanently to attain relaxation ( the so - called mode coupling transition ) . on the other hand , out of mean field or with finite system size",
    ", the system will be finally able to hop out of the state @xcite and relax , although an extremely large time will be needed to do so @xcite .",
    "the most important feature of these metastable states is that they are degenerate , this is , they can have the same free entropy .",
    "in fact , if one fixes a density @xmath86 and a value @xmath87 for the free entropy , it is possible to see that the number of states that share it ( in the functional picture , the number of minima which all have the same height @xmath87 ) scales exponentially with the size of the system , @xmath88 .",
    "this causes the total free entropy of the system to gain an extra term to take into account this fact : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is called _ complexity _ ( or alternatively configurational entropy ) , a central quantity in replica theory .",
    "larger than the largest number of performed monte carlo steps at each density value , i.e. @xmath52 steps ) so they were discarded in the fit .",
    "blue line is the fit result.[relaxation ] ]     as a function of density during compression and decompression scans .",
    "different colours correspond to different values of the planting density @xmath80 .",
    "points are the results of the monte carlo numerical simulations , lines are the analytical results obtained from the replica method within the isocomplexity assumption , as described in the text .",
    "black line represents the equilibrium pressure ( eq . ) and",
    "black arrows indicate the direction of experimental time , which runs from right to left during decompression scans ( points above the equilibrium line ) and from left to right during compression ( points below the equilibrium line ) .",
    "[ comparison ] ]      the replica method provides us with a standard procedure to compute the complexity and also the in - state entropy @xcite .",
    "its concrete application to hard - sphere systems is described in full - detail in section iii of @xcite , here we recall it briefly .",
    "it consists in introducing @xmath91 independent replicas of the system and forcing them to occupy the same metastable state .",
    "the entropy of the replicated system becomes then @xmath92 where @xmath87 is the free entropy of the state . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the partition function will be dominated with probability 1 only by the states with the entropy @xmath93 that satisfies the optimum condition @xmath94 the in - state entropy @xmath95 of those states and their complexity @xmath96 can then be derived using the following relations : @xmath97}{\\partial m } , \\label{complexityformula}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the function @xmath90 can then be reconstructed from the parametric plots of @xmath95 and @xmath98 .",
    "the replica formalism has been applied to the study of infinite dimensional hard - spheres in the series of papers @xcite , with remarkable success . however ,",
    "those results concern only the properties of the glass - former after equilibration , while our numerical results concern the glass former when it is still trapped inside a metastable state , _ before _ equilibration takes place .",
    "indeed , one could argue that , for experimental and practical purposes , getting predictions for this regime is even more important than the study of the equilibrium solution for infinite waiting times .",
    "this program however poses a challenge since in principle it requires to solve the dynamics for different preparation protocols . to this day ,",
    "the only first - principles dynamical theory for glass formers is the mode coupling theory @xcite , which performs well near the dynamical transition but notoriously fails at higher densities , forcing one to use phenomenological models for the description of the high density ( or low temperature ) regime , as done by keys et al . in @xcite .",
    "we present here a computation which has the advantage of being both fairly simple and _ static _ in nature .",
    "since the system is trapped in a single metastable state during the simulation , it is clear that its physical properties are determined only by the in - state entropy @xmath99 of that single state .",
    "we can easily determine @xmath93 at the beginning of the experiment , when the system is at equilibrium and it corresponds to @xmath100 , but it is nontrivial to determine it when the density is changed and the system falls out of equilibrium , as allows us to compute only quantities related to the states that dominate the partition function .",
    "indeed , we can see that for every density @xmath57 we can choose @xmath93 at our leisure simply by appropriately tuning the parameter @xmath91 , but in principle we still have no way of knowing what is actually the state the system is trapped into , i.e. we lack a criterion to choose a function @xmath101 consistent with the requirement that the system remains trapped in a single metastable state @xcite .    in order to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we assume that every state can be followed in density without any crossings between states , or bifurcations , or spinodal points @xcite ; this means that the number ( and thus the complexity ) of states that share the same value @xmath87 of the in - state entropy is a _ conserved quantity _ during the experiment , and can then be used as a label for the states .",
    "this method is usually referred to as _ isocomplexity _ @xcite .    in summary , to choose @xmath101",
    "we impose that @xmath102 this assumption is false in most cases .",
    "for example it has been recently shown that for infinite - dimensional hard spheres a full replica symmetry breaking ( frsb ) scenario holds for sufficiently high density @xcite , invalidating the isocomplexity hypothesis . the only exact method to tackle the problem",
    "would then be the _ state following _ approach , which uses the two - replica potential as central tool @xcite .",
    "however , this method is far more complex and its application goes beyond the scope of this paper , thus we limit ourselves to the isocomplexity assumption , referring to @xcite for the complete state - following computation . for a systematic comparison of the different approaches in the context of p - spin glasses ,",
    "see @xcite .     plane for @xmath103 .",
    "green line is the clustering line.[isocomplexitym ] ]    we refer to the si for the details of the computation of the isocomplexity lines displayed in figure [ isocomplexitym ] .",
    "once the potential @xmath104 has been obtained , one can compute the desired physical observables using standard thermodynamic relations @xcite .",
    "final results for pressure during decompression and compression are shown in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] and compared to simulation results .",
    "there is a good agreement between analytical and numerical curves , especially for density values not too far from @xmath80 .",
    "we studied a mean - field model of glass transition , the mk model .",
    "we were able both to obtain a stable glass , thanks to the planting technique , and to study numerically and analitically ( within replica method and isocomplexity assumption ) the variations of pressure caused by relatively fast changes of density .",
    "we showed , both numerically and analitically , that qualitatively this model displays the same behaviour of experimental ultrastable glasses , reported in @xcite .",
    "our model seems to show a first - order phase transition when evading from metastable equilibrium ( see @xcite and the si ) .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the experiments that show that the melting of ultrastable glasses @xcite has some features in common with first order transitions .",
    "we have also shown that the rfot approach , together with the replica method , is able to qualitatively describe the process of glass formation through a slow annealing , with very little computational cost and without resorting to _ a posteriori _ phenomenological considerations .",
    "our results can be compared to the dsc experiments where cooling is much slower than heating and as a result the cooled configurations ( before heating ) may be approximated with equilibrium configurations .",
    "we can study this situation in the mk model just because we can plant a thermalised equilibrium configuration at the density we prefer .",
    "the very interesting problem of understanding the behaviour of dsc experiments when the cooling speed is the same ( or faster ) than the heating speed is not studied in this paper : in this situation analytic computations could be done only if we had under analytic control the dynamics , a goal that has not yet been reached .",
