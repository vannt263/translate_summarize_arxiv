    "<S> on various regular lattices ( simple cubic , body centred cubic .. ) decorating an edge with an ising spin coupled by bonds of strength @xmath0 to the original vertex spins and competing with a direct anti - ferromagnetic bond of strength @xmath1 can give rise to three transition temperatures for suitable @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> other random bipartite lattices such as the penrose tiling are more akin to the regular square lattice and require multiple decoration to have any affect .    </S>",
    "<S> the application of various classes of transformations , such as duality , star - triangle , and decoration - iteration to the ising model on regular two dimensional lattices has been exhaustively investigated in the past @xcite both as a means of obtaining solutions on new lattices and as a way of modelling the physical properties of substances with more complicated behaviour than simple ferromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> the decoration - iteration transformation acts exclusively at the level of the bonds in the lattice , so it knows nothing about the larger scale structure . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore still applicable on lattices which exhibit some form of geometrical disorder . in this short note </S>",
    "<S> we look at the effect of a decoration - iteration transformation on an ising model on just such a class of lattices . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a model with competing ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic interactions living on an ensemble of random quadrangulations ( i.e. coupled to two - dimensional quantum gravity ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic decoration - iteration transform is shown in fig.1 , where summing over the central spin @xmath3 with couplings @xmath0 gives rise to a new effective coupling @xmath4 between the primary vertex spins @xmath5 @xmath6 = a \\exp ( k \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2),\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9 . </S>",

    "<S> \\label{en}\\ ] ] along with an equation for the normalisation factor @xmath13    it was pointed out by nakano @xcite that generically the form of the transformation in both equs.([e2a],[en ] ) meant that _ three _ transitions could occur for an ising model . whether this behaviour actually occurred or not depended on the critical temperature values for a given lattice , along with the value of @xmath2 and the degree @xmath11 of iteration . for the singly decorated model , the minimum value of @xmath4 in equ.([e2a ] ) , for instance , </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath14 which is attained as @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> since this is larger than the critical value of the coupling at the anti - ferromagnetic transition on the square lattice @xmath16 the @xmath17 curve can at best intersect the ferromagnetic transition value @xmath18 and only one ( ferromagnetic ) transition will be in evidence in the decorated model . </S>",
    "<S> a generic curve displaying this behaviour is shown in fig.3 , which is for @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that @xmath17 does not dip below the line at @xmath20 , but does cross @xmath18 . as @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> is increased still further @xmath17 eventually becomes monotone decreasing , attaining @xmath21 as @xmath15 , so even the ferromagnetic transition disappears .    </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is strongly lattice dependent since we are looking for intersections of the @xmath17 curve with the critical values of the coupling . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath22 for the simple cubic lattice and @xmath23 for the body centred cubic lattice , these will display multiple transitions when the @xmath17 curve cuts through the anti - ferromagnetic critical coupling values for sufficiently large @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath0 is decreased ( i.e. the temperature is increased ) following the @xmath17 curve then takes one from a ferromagnetic phase via a paramagnetic phase to an anti - ferromagnetic phase and finally to a paramagnetic phase again . </S>",
    "<S> one thus has a sequence of one ferromagnetic and two anti - ferromagnetic transitions .    in short , for a lattice with an anti - ferromagnetic critical coupling of sufficiently small modulus , @xmath24 , multiple transitions are to be expected when competing direct and decorated bonds are present . for @xmath11-fold decoration </S>",
    "<S> the minimum value of @xmath17 tends to @xmath25 as @xmath15 , so @xmath26 is sufficient to induce a triple transition in even the square lattice ising model .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the case of the ising model coupled to 2d quantum gravity as an example of the application of decoration - iteration transformations on geometrically disordered lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the partition function for the ising model on a single planar graph @xmath27 with @xmath11 vertices is just @xcite @xmath28 the coupling to gravity is incorporated by introducing a sum over some class of planar graphs @xmath29 @xmath30 the grand canonical partition function for this model @xmath31 where @xmath32 can be expressed as the free energy @xmath33   </S>",
    "<S> \\right ) \\label{matint}\\ ] ] of a matrix model , where we have specifically given the potential which generates @xmath34 graphs and @xmath35 are @xmath36 hermitian matrices . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath37 limit is taken to pick out planar graphs .    </S>",
    "<S> the model as defined above has spins living on the vertices of @xmath34 planar graphs and has a critical coupling of @xmath38 , @xmath39 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it displays no anti - ferromagnetic transition , because both odd and even loops are present . </S>",
    "<S> the decoration process outlined above will thus not induce multiple transitions since there is no anti - ferromagnetic line for the curve @xmath17 to cross . </S>",
    "<S> it is a similar story for both @xmath40 planar graphs and their dual triangulations .    </S>",
    "<S> however the dual to the @xmath34 graphs , random quadrangulations , are rather more amenable to decoration . </S>",
    "<S> we can see from fig.4 that , although the number of squares round a vertex is arbitrary , the fact that every face is a square means that the random quadrangulation is bipartite and hence would be expected to have an anti - ferromagnetic transition . </S>",
    "<S> this has been confirmed both by direct simulation @xcite and by studies of the fisher ( temperature ) zeroes of the partition function @xcite . the critical coupling for the ferromagnetic transition on the random quadrangulations is given by the dual of the @xmath34 value , namely @xmath41 and the anti - ferromagnetic value by its inverse , @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> if we translate these back to @xmath4 we find @xmath43 for the ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic critical couplings respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we can immediately see that since @xmath24 it is now possible for the curve for a singly decorated @xmath17 to cross the anti - ferromagnetic line for a suitable @xmath2 value . in fig.5 </S>",
    "<S> we show @xmath17 for @xmath44 , where the three transition points may be seen . </S>",
    "<S> all of the transitions will display the @xmath45 @xcite exponents @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , unlike the regular square lattice , the ising model with singly decorated and competing bonds on random quadrangulations will display a sequence of one ferromagnetic and two anti - ferromagnetic transitions as the temperature is increased .    </S>",
    "<S> as we have noted , the decoration results are lattice dependent since they deal with critical temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the ensemble of random quadrangulations we discussed above includes degenerate gluings of the squares along multiple edges , since the original @xmath34 graphs do not exclude self - energy and vertex correction diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> no analytical results are available for an ensemble of `` regular '' random quadrangulations , where no multiple gluings are allowed , but the simulation of @xcite gave an estimate of @xmath47 , which lies outside the range for multiple transitions with a single decoration . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we would _ not _ expect to see the sequence of transitions discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> however , doubly decorated bonds have a minimum of @xmath17 at @xmath48 and thus would give rise to multiple transitions for these regular random quadrangulations , just as they do for the regular square lattice ising model .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible , of course , to elaborate the decoration procedure in various ways @xcite . introducing a higher spin @xmath3 which can take values @xmath49 as the decorating spin and taking its interaction with the ising spins to be @xmath50 gives an effective coupling @xmath51\\ ] ] ( where we have again allowed for a direct anti - ferromagnetic bond ) . </S>",
    "<S> for this higher spin decoration @xmath17 still looks broadly similar to figs.3,5 , but increasing @xmath52 has the effect of deepening the minimum in @xmath17 and hence allowing multiple transitions where decoration by a spin one - half ising spin would be insufficient .    </S>",
    "<S> the ising models discussed here have been living on an annealed ensemble of random quadrangulations since the sum over graphs in equ.([sum ] ) is at the level of the partition function and not the free energy . </S>",
    "<S> they therefore represent a very particular sort of annealed geometrical disorder . a natural elaboration of the discussion here is to consider the effects of similar , but quenched , geometrical disorder . </S>",
    "<S> although there have been no investigations of the case of quenched ensembles of @xmath34 graphs or random quadrangulations , simulations of various spin models on quenched ensembles of @xmath40 graphs or their dual triangulations strongly suggest that there is little , if any change , in the critical couplings by comparison with the annealed ensemble @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the preceding discussion of the effects of the decoration - iteration transformation could therefore be carried over verbatim  on quenched random quadrangulations ( allowing degenerate gluings ) a competing anti - ferromagnetic and decorated ferromagnetic bonds would be expected to give rise to multiple transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> other models with quenched geometrical disorder can also be subjected to the same treatment . </S>",
    "<S> a penrose tiling is just such a case , since it is composed of rhombi and hence displays an anti - ferromagnetic transition . </S>",
    "<S> the critical couplings here are @xmath53 @xcite , so as for the square lattice ising model and the regular random quadrangulations higher decoration , or higher spin decoration , would be required to force the system to display multiple transitions . on </S>",
    "<S> the penrose tiling all of the transitions would be in the onsager universality class .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have seen that geometrical disorder is no hindrance to carrying out a decoration - iteration transformation and inducing multiple transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the critical coupling on ( annealed ) random quadrangulations means that a single decoration is sufficient to have an effect . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that quenched random quadrangulations would show a similar effect . </S>",
    "<S> it might be of some interest to explore the effect of some of the other `` classic '' transformations , such as decoration - iteration in field or star - triangle , for the ising model coupled to 2d quantum gravity ( i.e. living on planar random graphs or their duals ) since , at least implicitly , the solution in field is available . </S>"
