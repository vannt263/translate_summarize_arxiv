    "our main result concerns the crossover temperature @xmath240 , at which the ( classical and quantum ) corrections to the leading divergent gaussian specific heat become equal to the landau mean - field discontinuity in the specific heat . when the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 is larger than @xmath240 , the gaussian fluctuations ( and especially the quantum ones ) cause a ( surprising ) decrease in the ginzburg region , by a factor which can be as large as @xmath260 [ see eq .",
    "( [ tg0 ] ) ] .",
    "however , when @xmath1 is smaller than @xmath240 , the landau mean - field discontinuity becomes smaller than the contribution from the fluctuations , so that the ginzburg criterion implies an almost vanishing gaussian specific heat .",
    "therefore , one should no longer use the specific heat to deduce the ginzburg criterion .    in three dimensions we estimate @xmath261k , which is rather low .",
    "however , @xmath240 increases at lower dimensions , which casts doubts on the use of the ` standard ' ginzburg criterion for low transition temperature superconductors in those dimensions .    it should be noted that we derived the ginzburg criterion above @xmath1 , based on the specific heat .",
    "other derivations of the ginzburg criterion are mainly below @xmath1 , e.g. comparing the fluctuations in the order parameter to its average value , @xcite or comparing the ordering free energy in a coherence volume to @xmath262.@xcite in ref .",
    "we compared the persistent current due to the gaussian fluctuations to that generated by the quartic term in the gl free energy .",
    "all of these criteria give the same scaling with the basic physical parameters of the problem , but yield different prefactors .",
    "future work should consider the effects of quantum fluctuations on these other criteria .",
    "it should also be noted that similar correction terms arise in all phase transitions ( even without the quantum fluctuations ) .",
    "we hope that our paper will stimulate more discussion of such corrections in other cases .",
