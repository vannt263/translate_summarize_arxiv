    "in the quest to construct large - scale quantum information processors , in particular quantum computers , decoherence is still the main obstacle to realization .",
    "decoherence is the degradation of quantum information due to inevitable interactions with the environment .",
    "early skepticism @xcite concerning the viability of quantum computation ( qc ) in the presence of decoherence was overcome by the discovery of quantum error correcting codes ( qeccs),@xcite that flourished into a comprehensive theory that incorporates all elements of quantum computation.@xcite a qecc relies on an encoding of quantum information into the state of several quantum bits ( qubits ) , and a closed - loop , active error diagnosis and correction procedure.@xcite in principle , it is possible to correct arbitrary errors using sufficiently large qeccs.@xcite in practice , however , this may require a very large overhead , especially in terms of qubit resources.@xcite this is troubling in light of the substantial difficulties associated with generating and controlling systems with very large numbers of qubits .",
    "in addition , the theory of qeccs is rather abstract , in that it presumes that one can execute certain logical operations , but does not refer to the underlying hamiltonians governing specific physical systems .",
    "hence it is of interest to explore alternatives to qeccs , that are more economical in qubit resources , and that are direcly tailored to specific quantum computer proposals .",
    "here we review our recent progress in developing such an alternative , `` encoded recoupling and decoupling '' ( erd),@xcite and report on some new results .",
    "erd is based on a combination of encoding quantum information into a decoherence - free subspace ( dfs ) @xcite ( for a review see ref .  ) , and the application of fast and strong dynamical - decoupling ( or `` bang - bang '' , bb ) pulses.@xcite the dfs encoding provides a first layer of protection against decoherence , while the bb pulses are used to efficiently reduce the remaining decoherence .",
    "the encoded `` recoupling '' part of erd refers to the application of control operations that enact universal quantum logic , in a manner that is fully compatible with the dfs encoding and the bb  pulses , and takes into account the experimentally available control resources , such as the underlying system hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the utility of erd as a general method for quantum simulation , universal qc , and decoherence suppression has also been stressed and explored by viola.@xcite our work builds in part on earlier efforts to combine universal qc with dfs encoding ( without bb pulses).@xcite    the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in section  [ decoherence ] with a brief formal summary of decoherence .",
    "we then give in section  [ dfs ] a simple example of a dfs encoding , protecting against collective dephasing .",
    "section  [ logic ] shows how to perform universal qc on this encoding .",
    "we then briefly and formally review the dynamical decoupling method , in section  [ decoupling ] .",
    "the methods are then combined in sections  [ createdfs],[leakage - elim ] , where we show how bb pulses can eliminate decoherence sources beyond collective dephasing . in section  [ offres ]",
    "we present a new and somewhat surprising result : the elimination of off - resonant transitions , that will typically be induced by bb pulses , via bb pulses .",
    "section  [ all ] shows how to combine all the pieces together , by including logic gates with the bb pulses .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the dynamics of an open quantum system coupled to a bath is formally obtained from the time - ordered evolution @xmath0 under the combined system - bath hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the identity operator , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is the internal hamiltonian for the system ( bath ) alone , @xmath5 is an externally applied control hamiltonian , @xmath6 is the system - bath interaction hamiltonian , and the @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are operators acting on the system ( bath ) .",
    "the @xmath7 play the role of error generators in qc . making the standard assumption of initially decoupled system and bath , one traces over the bath degrees of freedom in order to obtain the time - evolved reduced system density matrix : @xmath9 ,   \\label{eq : rhot}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 [ @xmath11 is the initial density matrix of the system [ bath ] .",
    "as is well - known , @xmath12 is in general a mixed state : @xmath13<1 $ ] , indicating that the environment has decohered the system ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "we briefly review the simplest example of a dfs .",
    "suppose that a system of @xmath14 qubits ( two - level systems ) is coupled to a bath in a symmetric way , and undergoes a dephasing process .",
    "this can be described by the system - bath hamiltonian @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the pauli-@xmath17 matrix acting on the @xmath18th qubit and @xmath19 is an arbitrary bath operator . under this interaction qubit @xmath18",
    "undergoes the transformation @xmath20 which ( after @xmath21 ) puts a random phase @xmath22 between the basis states @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( eigenstates of @xmath25 with respective eigenvalues @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "this can also be described by the matrix @xmath28 acting on the @xmath29 basis .",
    "as implied by ( [ eq : hcol - deph ] ) , we assume that the phase has no space ( @xmath18 ) dependence , i.e. , the dephasing process is invariant under qubit permutations .",
    "since the errors can be expressed in terms of the single pauli spin matrix @xmath30 of the two - level system , this example is referred to as `` collective phase damping '' , or `` weak collective decoherence''.@xcite the more general situation when errors involving all three pauli matrices are present , i.e. , dissipation and dephasing , is referred to as `` strong collective decoherence '' , @xcite or just `` collective decoherence''.@xcite without encoding a qubit initially in an arbitrary pure state @xmath31 will decohere .",
    "this can be seen by calculating its density matrix as an average over all possible values of @xmath22 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a probability density , and we assume the initial state of all qubits to be a product state . for a gaussian distribution , @xmath34 ,",
    "it is simple to check that @xmath35 the decay of the off - diagonal elements in the computational basis is a signature of decoherence .",
    "let us now consider what happens in the two - qubit hilbert space .",
    "the four basis states undergo the transformation @xmath36 observe that the basis states @xmath37 and @xmath38 evolves under the dephasing process as @xmath39 and the overall phase thus acquired is clearly unimportant .",
    "this means that the 2-dimensional subspace @xmath40 of the 4-dimensional hilbert space of two qubits is _ decoherence - free _ ( df ) .",
    "the subspaces @xmath41 and @xmath42 are also ( trivially ) df , since they each acquire a global phase as well , @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "since the phases acquired by the different subspaces differ , there is decoherence _ between _ the subspaces .    for @xmath45 qubits",
    "a similar calculation reveals that the subspaces @xmath46 and @xmath47 are df , as well the ( trivial )  subspaces @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "more generally , let @xmath50 in a computational basis state ( i.e. , a bitstring ) over @xmath14 qubits .",
    "then it is easy to check that any subspace spanned by states with constant @xmath51 is df , and can be denoted @xmath52 in accordance with the notation above .",
    "the dimensions of these subspaces are given by the binomial coefficients : @xmath53={\\binom{k}{\\lambda _ { k}}}$ ] and they each encode @xmath54 qubits .",
    "the encoding for the `` collective phase damping '' model discussed here has been tested experimentally .",
    "the first - ever experimental implementation of dfss used the @xmath55 subspace to protect against artifially induced decoherence in a linear optics setting.@xcite the same encoding was subsequently used to alleviate the problem of external fluctuating magnetic fields in an ion trap quantum computing experiment @xcite , and figures prominently in theoretical constructions of encoded , universal qc.@xcite",
    "next we show how to perform universal qc on the encoding @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 denote the standard pauli matrices @xmath58 , acting on the @xmath59th physical qubit ( we will use both notations interchangeably ) . in ref .",
    "it was shown that for the code @xmath60 the encoded logical operations ( involving the first two physical qubits ) are    @xmath61    these operations form an @xmath62 algebra ( i.e. , we think of them as hamiltonians rather than unitary operators ) .",
    "we use a bar to denote logical operations on the encoded qubits . in refs .",
    "@xcite these logical operations were denoted by @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and a detailed analysis was given on how to use typical solid - state hamiltonians ( heisenberg , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 models , defined below ) to implement quantum logic operations using this dfs encoding .",
    "e.g. , the term @xmath67 is the spin - spin interaction in the @xmath66 model , and @xmath68 represents a zeeman splitting .",
    "a static zeeman splitting and a controllable @xmath66 interaction can be used to generate a universal set of logic gates .",
    "similar conclusions hold when the @xmath66 interaction is replaced by a heisenberg @xcite or @xmath65 interaction,@xcite or even by a heisenberg interaction that includes an anistropic spin - orbit term.@xcite we remark that , as first shown in refs .",
    ", the various types of exchange interactions can be made universal also without any single - qubit terms ( such as a zeeman splitting ) , by encoding into three or more qubits,@xcite a result that has been termed `` encoded universality''.@xcite    the two - qubit gate can be expressed as follows : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath2 is the identity operator . in the context of trapped - ion qc,@xcite",
    "the phase @xmath71 is the phase of the driving laser at the @xmath59th qubit , while @xmath72 is proportional to the rabi frequency , and can be set over a wide range of values.@xcite introducing the operators @xmath73 ( denoted @xmath74 , @xmath75 respectively in refs .  )",
    "we can express    @xmath76    where @xmath77 @xmath78 .",
    "it is simple to check that @xmath79 and @xmath80 annihilate the code subspace @xmath81 and have non - trivial action ( as encoded @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) on the orthogonal subspace @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , upon restriction to the dfs we can write : @xmath85 the fact that @xmath86 depends only on the relative phase @xmath87 is crucial in the trapped - ion context : this quantity can be controlled by adjusting the angle between the driving laser and the interatomic axis , as well as by small adjustments of the trap voltages ( which , in turn , control the trap oscillation frequency , and hence the qubit spacing ) , whereas it is much harder to control the absolute phase @xmath71,@xcite and hence also @xmath88 .",
    "this is why the code subspace @xmath89 enjoys a preferred status over the subspace @xmath90 .",
    "the hamiltonians in eq .",

    "the following unitary gate was introduced , which is particularly suitable for qc using trapped ions : @xmath96 this gate can be used to entangle two dfs - qubits .",
    "it involves simultaneous control over two phase differences @xmath97 , and thus control over the motion of two pairs of qubits .",
    "the case @xmath98 was used in ref .   to demonstrate entanglement of four trapped - qubit qubits , but this choice is not unique .    for general exchange hamiltonians a different method is required .",
    "we review the encoded recoupling method introduced in ref .  .",
    "the exchange interaction quite generally has the form @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101    the isotropic ( heisenberg ) case corresponds to @xmath102 .",
    "the @xmath66 model is the case @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",

    "a summary of qc proposals that fall into each category can be found in ref .  .",

    "typically has control over only one type of parameter out of the set @xmath110 .",
    "let @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , and @xmath113 .",

    "( [ eq : identity ] ) that the operation of `` conjugating by @xmath114 '' , @xmath116 causes @xmath115 s sign to be flipped .",

    "for simplicity let us consider just the case @xmath120 .",
    "then we can rewrite @xmath121 where we have omitted a constant term .",
    "the important point is now that @xmath122 and @xmath123 satisfy @xmath62 commutation relations .",
    "therefore by using recoupling through `` conjugation by @xmath124 '' we can selectively turn on and off the single - encoded - qubit rotation @xmath123 and the encoded - ising interaction @xmath125 .",
    "this example of `` encoded selective recoupling '' establishes that encoded universal computation in the @xmath65 model can be done using control over the @xmath117 parameters alone .",
    "next , consider the @xmath66 model , with controllable @xmath126 , but fixed @xmath127 . to implement encoded single - qubit operations",
    ", we can use the same encoded recoupling method as for the @xmath65 model . as for encoded two - qubit operations",
    ", we now no longer have the @xmath128 terms .",
    "since the @xmath66 model with nearest - neighbor interactions can be shown not to be universal,@xcite we turn on also next - nearest neighbor @xmath126 terms ( these can still be nearest - neighbor in a 2d hexagonal geometry ) .",
    "first note that @xmath129 .",
    "now assume we can control @xmath130 ; then , using conjugation by @xmath131 : @xmath132 .",

    ", @xmath134 again acts as @xmath135 , i.e. , as an encoded @xmath136 .",
    "this establishes universal encoded computation in the @xmath66 model .",
    "taken together , the results in this section show how universal qc can be implemented using qubits encoded into a dfs offering protection against collective dephasing , while using only reasonable models of physically controllable hamiltonians .",
    "we now move on to a discussion of how to reduce additional sources of decoherence .",
    "we briefly review the dynamical decoupling method , introduced in ref .  , and further developed in refs .  .",

    "the cycle time is @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the number of symmetrization operations , and @xmath141 is the time that the system evolves freely between operations under @xmath142 .",
    "the symmetrized evolution after a single cycle is given by @xmath143 where the evolution under @xmath144 has been neglected during application of the pulses @xmath145 , which quantifies the sense in which these pulses have to be fast and strong ( for details see , e.g , refs .  ) .",

    "one can then retain only the first order magnus term , approximating @xmath152 by @xmath153 is the projector into the centralizer @xmath154 of @xmath155 , defined as @xmath156 since the pulses @xmath157 are unitary the centralizer equals the commutant in this case : @xmath158=0,\\;\\forall v_{j}\\in \\mathcal{g}\\}.   \\nonumber\\ ] ] it is clear that @xmath159 commutes with the adjoint action @xmath160 for all @xmath18 , so that if @xmath161 is generated by @xmath162 , the evolution will proceed without the operators @xmath7 affecting the system as errors : the evolution has been _ symmetrized _ with respect to @xmath161.@xcite for a geometric interpretation of this symmetrization see ref .  , where it was also pointed out that while the bb pulses should have the effect of rotating @xmath163 to the vertices of a symmetric object , they need in fact not form a group .",
    "one of the important advantages of the dfs encoding @xmath164 is that it is immune to collective dephasing . however , other sources of decoherence inevitably remain . in this and the following section",
    ", we algebraically classify all additional decoherence effects and show how they can be eliminated .",
    "first , let us analyze the effect of breaking the collective dephasing symmetry , by considering a system - bath interaction of the form @xmath165 where @xmath166 are arbitrary bath operators [ compare to eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcol - deph ] ) ] .",
    "this describes a general dephasing interaction on two qubits .",
    "the source of such dephasing during storage can be long wavelength , randomly fluctuating ambient magnetic fields,@xcite that randomly shift the relative phase between the qubit @xmath23 and @xmath24 states through the zeeman effect .",
    "the interaction can be rewritten as a sum over a collective dephasing term @xmath167 and another , differential dephasing term @xmath168 , that is responsible for errors on the dfs : @xmath169 here @xmath170 and @xmath171 . if @xmath172 were zero then there would only be collective dephasing and the dfs encoding would offer perfect protection . however , in general @xmath173 , and the dfs encoding will not suffice to offer complete protection .",
    "the crucial observation is that , since @xmath174 [ recall eq .",
    "( [ eq : bars ] ) ] , the offending term causes _ logical _ errors on the dfs.@xcite as shown in refs .",
    ", then the problem of @xmath175 can be solved using a series of pulses that symmetrize @xmath176 such that only the collective term remains .",
    "to do so note that since the offending term @xmath177 , it anticommutes with @xmath178 . at the same time @xmath179 commutes with @xmath180",
    "this allows us to flip the sign of the offending term by using a pair of @xmath181 pulses in @xmath179 , while leaving only the collective term .",
    "evolution with the flipped sign followed by unaltered evolution leads to cancellation of the offending term .",
    "specifically:@xcite    @xmath182    or , in terms of gates : @xmath183 where @xmath184 was defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ubar ] ) .",
    "this equation means that the system - bath coupling effectively looks like collective dephasing at the end of the pulse sequence .",
    "thus , the system is periodically ( every @xmath185 ) projected into the dfs .    in order for the the procedure described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sym ] ) to work , the gate @xmath186 must be executed at a timescale faster than the cutoff frequency associated with the fluctuating ( magnetic ) fields causing the differential dephasing term in @xmath187 .",
    "so far we have discussed creation of collective dephasing conditions on a single dfs  qubit .",
    "however , it is essential for the reliable execution of an entangling logic gate to have collective dephasing over all four qubits participating in the gate , even if only two are coupled at a time . a procedure for creating collective _ decoherence _ conditions over blocks of @xmath188 and @xmath189 qubits was given in ref .",
    "here we show how to do the same for a block of 4 qubits with collective dephasing .",
    "let us start with a general dephasing hamiltonian on @xmath148 qubits , and rewrite it in terms of nearest - neighbor sums and differences : @xmath190 where @xmath191 .",
    "as noted above , @xmath192 , so that to eliminate all nearest - neighbor differences of the form @xmath193 we can use the collective decoupling pulse @xmath194 :    @xmath195    or , in gate terms :    @xmath196 e^{-ih_{sb}\\tau } \\left [ \\bigotimes_{j=1}^{n/2}\\bar{u}_{2j-1,2j } ( \\frac{\\pi } { 2},0)\\right ] = e^{-i2\\tau \\sum_{j=1}^{n/2}\\left ( z_{2j}+z_{2j-1}\\right ) \\otimes b_{2j}^{+}}.\\ ] ] the next step is to eliminate next - nearest neighbor differential terms . to this end let us rewrite the outcome of the @xmath197 pulse in terms of sums and differences over blocks of four ions : @xmath198 \\otimes b_{2j}^{+,+ }   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{j=1}^{n/2}\\left [ ( z_{2j+2}-z_{2j})+(z_{2j+1}-z_{2j-1})\\right ] \\otimes b_{2j}^{+,-},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath199 .",
    "the term in the first line contains only the desired block - collective dephasing over @xmath200 ions .",
    "the term in the second line contains undesired differential dephasing terms that we wish to eliminate . but these terms once again have the appearance of encoded @xmath154 operators , between next - nearest neighbor ion pairs .",
    "therefore we need to apply a second collective pulse @xmath201 , that applies encoded @xmath82 operators on these qubit pairs . at this point",
    "we are left just with collective dephasing terms on blocks of @xmath200 qubits , as required : @xmath202   & \\times &   \\nonumber \\label{eq : create4 } \\\\",

    "the reduction of differential dephasing errors , as in the previous subsection , is particularly relevant for storage errors .",
    "however , this is only the first step .",
    "additional sources of decoherence may take place during storage , and in particular during the execution of logic gates .",
    "it is useful to provide a complete algebraic classification of the possible decoherence processes .",
    "this will allow us to see what can be done using decoupling pulses .",
    "to this end let us now write the system - bath hamiltonian on two physical qubits in the general form @xmath203 where @xmath204 where @xmath2 is the identity operator , @xmath205 ( etc . ) , and where @xmath206 means a linear combination of these operators tensored with bath operators .",

    "the operators in @xmath209 either vanish on the dfs , or are proportional to identity on it . in either case",
    "their effect is to generate an overall phase on the dfs , so they can be safely ignored from now on .",
    "the operators in @xmath210 are the _ leakage errors _ : terms that cause transitions between states inside and outside of the dfs .",
    "a universal and efficient decoupling method for eliminating such errors , for arbitrary numbers of ( encoded)qubits was given in ref .  .",
    "finally , the operators in @xmath211 have the form of logic gates on the dfs . however , these are undesired logic operations , since they are coupled to the bath , and thus cause decoherence .    in the previous subsection we showed how to eliminate the logical error @xmath212 , but we see now that this was only one error in a much larger set . to deal with the additional errors it is useful at this point to introduce a more compact notation for the pulse sequences .",

    "if such a term appears in the system - bath interaction it too will be eliminated using the same procedure .",
    "so far we have used a @xmath220 pulse .",

    "if we turn on an interaction @xmath245 then the total hamiltonian is @xmath246 which can be written as    @xmath247 where the leakage term is @xmath248 now note that @xmath249 using this we now show how to eliminate each of the leakage terms one by one .",
    "first , we eliminate @xmath250 by the bb sequence @xmath251 the new hamiltonian @xmath252 does not contain @xmath250 next , we eliminate @xmath253 by @xmath254where @xmath255 .",
    "we can clearly repeat this procedure so as to eliminate all leakage . _",
    "the crucial point is that since we have used the system hamiltonian to generate bb pulses , off - resonant transitions do not take place _ : @xmath256 has no matrix elements between different levels .",
    "a concern is how we to obtain @xmath257 .",
    "this problem is shared by other methods dealing with the same problem.@xcite in principle it can be solved provided the level spacings are rationally related . note in this context that usually we do not need to eliminate all @xmath258 , since @xmath259 and typically decrease exponentially according to time - independent perturbation theory .",
    "we have assumed that there is no degeneracy .",
    "if there is , then all degenerate transitions will be eliminated simultaneously , so the procedure is simplified .",
    "so far we have discussed computation using the encoded recoupling method ( section [ logic ] ) , and encoded decoupling ( sections [ createdfs],[leakage - elim ] ) .",
    "we now put the two together in order to obtain the full erd  picture .",
    "at least two methods are available for combining quantum computing operations with the sequences of decoupling pulses we have presented above . for a general analysis of this issue see ref .  .      the decoupling pulse sequences given in sec .",
    "[ leakage - elim ] `` stroboscopically '' create collective dephasing conditions at the conclusion of each cycle . as noted above",
    ", this is equivalent to a periodic projection into the dfs .",
    "this property allows for `` stroboscopic '' quantum computation at the corresponding projection times.@xcite here the computation pulses need to be synchronized with the decoupling pulses , and inserted at the end of each cycle . because of the conditions on the validity of the bb method,@xcite the amount of time available for implementation of a logic gate is no more than the bath correlation time @xmath260 .",
    "( an exception to this rule is the case of @xmath261 noise.@xcite ) assuming the dominant decoherence contributions not accounted for by the dfs encoding to come from differential dephasing ( setting the @xmath262 time - scale ) , and given that we already assumed that we can use pulses with interval @xmath263 @xmath262 , it is consistent to assume that we can then also perform logic gates on the same time scale",
    ".      there may be an advantage to using fast but weak pulses for the logic gates , while preserving the fast + strong property of the decoupling pulses .",
    "to see how to combine logic gates with decoupling in this case , let us denote by @xmath264 the controllable system hamiltonian that generates the entangling gate @xmath265 [ recall eq .",
    "( [ eq : uij ] ) ] .",
    "suppose first that we turn on this logic - gate generating hamiltonian in a manner that is neither very strong nor very fast , so that the system - bath interaction is not negligible while @xmath3 is on ( this obviously puts less severe demands on experimental implementation ) .",

    "let us now show how to efficiently combine logic operations and decoupling pulses . for simplicity consider only the case where we can neglect the @xmath275 error , i.e. , our decoupling sequence is the 4-pulse one given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4pulses ] ) .",
    "suppose we wish to implement a logical @xmath82 operation , i.e. , @xmath276 .",
    "recall that this involves turning on the hamiltonian @xmath277 between two physical qubits . because the decoupling pulses @xmath278 and @xmath279 are generated in terms of the same hamiltonian",
    ", they commute with @xmath280 while eliminating @xmath6 ( except for the terms in @xmath6 that have trivial action on the dfs ) .",
    "thus the conditions under which eq .",
    "( [ eq : ucomp ] ) were shown to hold are satisfied .",
    "this allows us to insert the logic gates into the four free evolution periods involved in the pulse sequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq:4pulses ] ) .",
    "thus , the full pulse sequence that combines creation of collective dephasing conditions with execution of the logic gate is : @xmath281 with @xmath282 $ ] , and which , using the dfs encoding , is equivalent to the desired @xmath283 .",
    "this involves 8 control pulses , 4 of which are of the fast+strong type ( those involving @xmath231 and @xmath228 ) , and 4 of which must be fast , but need not be so strong that we can neglect @xmath6 .",
    "if we wish to implement logical @xmath83 operation , i.e. , @xmath284 , then we can not now use @xmath231 and @xmath228 , since they anticommute with @xmath285 and will eliminate it .",
    "instead we should use decoupling pulses generated in terms of @xmath285 , which will also have the desired effect of eliminating @xmath222 , as well as @xmath286 and @xmath287 logical errors , while commuting with the @xmath288 logic operations ( and for this reason can of course not eliminate @xmath232 errors ) .",
    "these are just the @xmath237 and @xmath289 pulses defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pqetc ] ) . in gate terms",
    "this implies turning on the hamiltonian @xmath290 between two physical qubits .",
    "thus : @xmath291 with @xmath292 $ ] , and which , using the dfs encoding , is equivalent to the desired @xmath293 .",
    "finally , to generate single dfs - qubit rotations about an arbitrary axis we can combine eqs .",
    "( [ eq : x]),([eq : y ] ) according to the euler angles construction.@xcite given that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : x]),([eq : y ] ) each take 8 pulses , the euler angle method will generate an arbitrary dfs - qubit rotation in at most 24 pulses .",
    "concerning gates that entangle two dfs - qubits , the situation may be more involved , since now the next - nearest neighbor pulses in eq .",
    "( [ eq : create4 ] ) , that create the collective dephasing conditions on four qubits , do not all commute with the @xmath294 gate of eq .",
    "( [ eq : u4 ] ) . therefore here we must resort to the strong + fast method of the previous subsection , i.e. , we need to synchronize the @xmath294 pulses with the end of the decoupling pulse sequence .",
    "we do not here analyze the situation with respect to the exchange hamiltonian implementation of conditional logic gates .",
    "taken together , the methods described in this section provide an explicit way to implement universal qc in a manner that offers protection against all sources of qubit decoherence , using a fast + strong ( or fast + weak ) versions of logic gates .",
    "we have proposed a method of encoded recoupling and decoupling ( erd ) for performing decoherence - protected quantum computation .",
    "our method combines an encoding into qubit - pair decoherence - free subspaces ( each pair yielding one encoded qubit ) , with sequences of recoupling and decoupling pulses .",
    "the qubit encoding protects against collective dephasing processes , while the decoupling pulses symmetrize all other sources of decoherence into a collective dephasing interaction .",
    "the recoupling pulses are used to implement encoded quantum logic gates , either during or in between the decoupling pulses .",
    "the dynamical decoupling method requires an exponential number of pulses if the most general form of decoherence is to be suppressed , that can couple arbitrary numbers of qubits to the environment ( total decoherence @xcite ) .",
    "this exponential scaling is avoided here by focusing on decoherence elimination inside blocks of _ finite _ size ( e.g. , at most four qubits ) where arbitrary decoherence is allowed .",
    "however , we have implicitly assumed that there are no decoherence processes coupling different blocks .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for most quantum computer implementation , provided the different blocks can be kept sufficiently far apart until they need to be brought together in order to execute inter - block logic gates .",
    "when this happens , erd can still be efficiently applied on the temporarily larger block .",
    "it may be questioned whether there is any advantage in using erd compared to methods of active quantum error correcting codes ( qecc ) .",
    "both erd and qecc are capable of dealing with arbitrary decoherence processes , and are fully compatible with universal quantum computation .",
    "there are two main advantages to erd : first , we need only two physical qubits per logical qubit , compared to a redundancy of five to one , in order to handle all single - qubit errors in qecc.@xcite so far the most advanced experiments outside nmr , i.e. , those involving trapped ions , have used up to four qubits,@xcite so that this encoding economy is a distinct advantage for near - term experiments .",
    "second , our method is directly compatible with hamiltonians describing a variety of quantum computer proposals . on the other hand",
    "it is not clear how to directly use qecc given hamiltonians describing specific systems .",
    "these are general features of erd : economy of encoding redundancy and use of only the most easily controllable interactions .",
    "the disadvantage of erd compared to qecc is that there does not exist , at this point , a result analogous to the threshold theorem of fault tolerant quantum error correction .",
    "this means that we can not yet guarantee full scalability of erd as a stand - alone method , because we do not yet know how to compensate for imperfect pulses .",
    "however , in principle it is always possible to concatenate erd with qecc , as done , e.g. , for dfs with qecc in refs .",
    ", and then the standard fault tolerance results apply .",
    "we expect that the theory of composite pulses @xcite will also play a key role in this further development of erd .",
    "we hope that the methods proposed here will inspire experimentalists to implement encoded recoupling and decoupling in the lab , thus demonstrating the possibility of fully decoherence - protected quantum computation .",
