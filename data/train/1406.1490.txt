    "<S> introduction_.topological insulators exhibit a variety of phenomena usually associated with quantum behaviors of electrons in strong magnetic fields , even though no such fields are present  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a characteristic aspect of these phenomena is the so - called bulk - boundary correspondence due to the appearance of robust states at the edges of the system , whose precise structure is determined by the topology of the bulk state . in particular , edge transport in a four - terminal geometry  @xcite can reveal the change in bulk topology by yielding sharply different results depending on the number and chirality of the edge states in different gapped states . at a topological phase transition </S>",
    "<S> the bulk band gap closes and the low - energy dynamics is controlled by a gapless state . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , bulk metallic behavior also marks the change in the topological state .    </S>",
    "<S> much of the search for these remarkable systems has focused on materials with strong spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been appreciated that periodically driven systems can exhibit a rich topological phase diagram as the frequency , amplitude , and other properties of the drive are tuned  @xcite . in this way , a much simpler system can support topological states even if the static system does not @xcite . a prime candidate for realizing such a floquet topological insulator is graphene  @xcite in the presence of circularly polarized light  @xcite or other temporally periodic potentials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental evidence for a similar floquet state on the surface of bi@xmath1se@xmath2 has been reported in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting topological state is intrinsically dynamical and the correspondence between bulk and edge state structure is more subtle than in the static system . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a natural question arises as to the signature of the critical state that is realized at the transition between floquet topological states .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that while the low - energy critical dynamics in irradiated graphene is controlled by a massless dirac hamiltonian , the metallic transport across the system can be _ substantially _ suppressed , with conductivity much smaller than that of static systems , which is of order @xmath0  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , some topological transitions in floquet topological insulators may be concealed in the bulk system while the edge signatures are intact . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably and counterintuitively , disorder can increase conductivity by several orders of magnitude and thus unmask the topological transition . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the reason for this intricate behavior lies in an important contrast between floquet bands in a time - dependent two - dimensional system and energy bands of a static one . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the topological transitions in the former case are most naturally described by a @xmath3 dimensional theory @xcite , in which the extra ( time ) dimension is effectively compactified . </S>",
    "<S> the extra degree of freedom , present in the floquet system but absent in static leads , creates a mismatch between the two with sometimes dramatic consequences for transport . </S>",
    "<S> our theory also naturally explains why the phase diagram of topological states in such systems is , as we find , remarkably rich .        </S>",

    "<S> the field is assumed to be uniform in the plane so that the electronic states may be characterized by a two - dimensional wavevector * k * of a band @xmath7 within the hexagonal brillouin zone ( bz ) . </S>",
    "<S> because the vector potential is periodic , the time - dependent schrdinger equation represents a floquet problem @xcite , for which wavefunctions @xmath8 , two - component spinors encoding the wavefunction amplitudes on each of the sublattices of the honeycomb lattice , can be represented in the form @xmath9 with @xmath10 a periodic function . </S>",

    "<S> several transitions are observed where quasienergy gaps close around zero or @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the first topological transition for @xmath36 occurs when the gap at the fz boundary @xmath35 closes at the @xmath27 point ( @xmath37 ) . </S>",
    "<S> further topological transitions occur as @xmath38 increases , and may proceed in several ways , always involving a gap closing . in most cases </S>",
    "<S> the closings involve the formation of a dirac point either at zero quasienergy or at the fz boundary . </S>",
    "<S> these may occur at bz high - symmetry points , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , or @xmath29 , yielding , respectively one , two , or three distinct closing points . </S>",
    "<S> as explained in the next section , the gap closing at @xmath27 can sometimes be quadratic . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe gap closings away from high - symmetry points , in which case we observe six distinct dirac points at the transition .    </S>",
    "<S> these gap closings are accompanied by changes in the topology of the bulk band structure characterized by its chern numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the chern number @xmath39 of each floquet band is calculated by integrating its berry s curvature . </S>",
    "<S> because each dirac point induces an exchange of chern number @xmath40 between bands , and a quadratic touching induces an exchange of @xmath41 across the transition , all our transitions involve chern number changes of magnitude @xmath42 or 6  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bulk - boundary correspondence in a static system relates the chern number to the total number of edge states . </S>",
    "<S> however , in a floquet system , the two gap closings at zero quasienergy and at fz boundary are not equivalent : when edges are present in the system , changes in the number of edge states are induced around the quasienergy in which a gap closing occurs . </S>",
    "<S> this means there may be topologically distinguishable states with the same chern number . </S>",

    "<S> our model allows numerical computation of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , fully specifying the bulk topology and determining where edge states lie in the quasienergy spectrum  @xcite . </S>",
