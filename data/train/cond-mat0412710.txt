    "in the relentless search for smaller electronic devices , the idea of fabricating extremely small transistors using quantum dots has become an important topic . in recent years",
    ", the possibility of using a very small molecule as the quantum dot in a transistor has become apparent@xcite .",
    "such a device may be thought of as a molecular quantum dot weakly coupled to macroscopic charge reservoirs , or leads .",
    "molecules integrated into these transistors often have very complex structures and therefore introduce new electronic transport properties .",
    "for example , the shape of the molecule or the position of the molecule relative to the leads can change as charges are added onto the molecule .",
    "a number of experiments have investigated the effects of coupling between tunneling electrons and the on - dot vibrational quanta on various transport properties of the molecule @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the experimental evidence for electron - phonon coupling in a molecular device composed of c@xmath0 molecule deposited between a pair of gold electrodes@xcite .",
    "experimental results show peaks in the differential conductance which may be due to the effect of coupling between tunneling electrons and the molecular vibrational mode .",
    "several theoretical works@xcite have harnessed the study of electron - phonon coupling by introducing an on - dot phonon degree of freedom that couples to on - dot electrons and observed the effects the coupling has on various transport properties of the molecular transistor .",
    "one of the most recent comprehensive work on phonon effects in molecular transistors coupled to two _ non - interacting _ leads was conducted by mitra _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "they developed the density matrix formalism to study transport properties for both in - equilibrium and out - of - equilibrium phonon distributions .    in our work , we investigate how the phonon distribution _ and _ electron - electron interaction in the leads affect the steady state dc current and the dc noise characteristics of a molecular transistor .",
    "the phonon distribution can drastically change depending on how they are allowed to relax as they couple onto a bath . as discussed in mitra _",
    "et al_.@xcite , we must consider two competing time scales : time scale for the phonons to reach equilibrium via their interaction with the bath , @xmath1 ; and the dwell time of the electron on the dot , @xmath2 .",
    "the two limiting cases considered in this work are : the phonons are equilibrated to the bath corresponding to @xmath3 ; and the opposite case where the tunneling electrons see unequilibrated phonons corresponding to @xmath4 .",
    "we are particularly interested in the effects of electron - electron interaction in the leads . up to this date ,",
    "theoretical works have only considered non - interacting electrons in the leads .",
    "this is sufficient if the leads are two or three dimensional electron gases , where interactions affect the low energy properties of the lead only perturbatively .",
    "however , in one dimension , arbitrarily weak electron interaction completely changes the ground state . in our work",
    ", we consider the leads to be a luttinger liquid .",
    "our work may represent a physical device composed of a molecular quantum dot , such as c@xmath0 , coupled to two metallic single - walled carbon nanotubes , which behave essentially as interacting one - dimensional objects .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we consider a molecule with a single level coupled to two luttinger - liquid leads .",
    "we suppose that the electrons are coupled to the on - dot vibrational mode and consider both equilibrated and unequilibrated phonons .",
    "we solve the model in the density matrix formalism and apply the high - temperature approximation .",
    "the approximation will be used to derive the rate equation for the dot occupation probabilities and use the equation to compute the steady state dc current and the dc noise characteristics of the molecular transistor as a function of source - drain voltage . in section [ formulation ] , we introduce our model , provide a brief outline of the density matrix formalism , and present expressions for the tunneling current and the dc noise . in section [ results ] , we present numerical results for the current and the noise and discuss the dependence of these transport properties on the phonon distribution and the intralead electron interaction .",

    "we first compare currents for equilibrated and non - equilibrated phonons .",
    "et al_.@xcite pointed out a peculiar behaviour in the current ; near @xmath155 and with symmetric bias , the current is larger for equilibrated phonons than for non - equilibrated phonons .",
    "this is an unusual result since one would expect that phonons would arrange themselves so as to maximize the current in the non - equilibrium case .",
    "they attribute this peculiarity to the choice of @xmath150 at which many of the higher - order diagonal matrix elements ( corresponding to @xmath84-phonon-@xmath84-phonon processes ) , @xmath159 , are suppressed .",
    "although their work involved non - interacting leads , one can see in fig.[fig : current1 ] that this behaviour is observed also in the case of interacting leads .",
    "the behaviour , however , is not observed when @xmath160 , consistent with mitra _ et al_. s claim that this anomalous behaviour is pertinent to @xmath150 values close to 1 .",
    "the most apparent consequence of introducing interaction in the leads is the suppression of the tunneling current ; the current decreases as interaction strength is raised .",
    "the question is whether the suppression of the current is mainly due to changes in the phonon distribution induced by electron interaction in the leads or a more direct consequence of the luttinger - liquid distribution function .",
    "fig.[fig : phdist1 ] plots the phonon probability distribution for @xmath155 . upon careful inspection , a slight narrowing in the phonon distribution",
    "is observed ; probabilities of dot states with low phonon numbers are increased while the wing of the distribution , corresponding to the dot states with high phonon numbers , is suppressed .",
    "although they are not shown , the same subtle change in the phonon distribution is observed for other values of the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "however , because these changes are very small , the suppression in the current is unlikely due to the changes in the phonon distribution .",
    "thus the main effect comes from the luttinger - liquid distribution function that has replaced the fermi distribution in the expression for the current ( eq.[i ] ) .",
    "the luttinger - liquid distribution function represents single - particle - like excitations decaying faster over time than non - interacting electrons .",
    "this results in the suppression of the overall current .",
    "although fig.[fig : phdist1 ] shows that the phonon distribution is not a strong function of electron interaction in the leads , mitra _",
    "et al._@xcite showed that the phonon distribution is strongly affected by the electron - phonon coupling , @xmath150 .",
    "in particular , the distribution was farther from equilibrium for weak coupling than for strong coupling .",
    "we have observed that the phonon distribution strongly depends on the electron - phonon coupling even in the presence of intralead electron interaction .",
    "we conclude that varying the electron - phonon coupling has a much larger effect on the phonon distribution than varying the interaction in the leads .    another noticeable effect on the tunneling current due to interaction in the leads is the smearing and change in the slopes of the plateaus .",
    "these plateaus , which occur in a range of bias where the tunneling electrons encounter no new accessible excited state of the molecule , are flat in the case of non - interacting leads . however , as the interaction increases , the slopes also increase .",
    "this observation can be explained qualitatively in the zero - temperature limit , which is not the appropriate limit for this work but may give insight into this issue .",
    "the single - particle time correlation function for the luttinger - liquid behaves as @xmath161 .",
    "fourier transform of this correlation function , which relates directly to @xmath94 , then behaves as @xmath162 .",
    "therefore , the current should show @xmath163-type behaviour at low voltages .",
    "each time you excite a new phonon , current should show @xmath164-type behaviour , where @xmath165 is the voltage at which a new phonon is excited .",
    "indeed , in the non - interacting limit , where @xmath101 , the slope is zero . however , when @xmath103 , the tilt and the smearing of the plateaus result .",
    "dc noise characteristics are obtained under both symmetric and asymmetric bias conditions for non - equilibrated phonons .",
    "the noise for equilibrated phonons is not presented here . in section [ current ]",
    ", we argued that the modification in the current due to interaction in the leads is mainly due to the luttinger - liquid nature of the electrons in the leads , not so much the induced change in the phonon distribution .",
    "for this reason , we anticipate that the effects of interaction on the dc noise for equilibrated phonons will be very similar for the case of non - equilibrated phonons .",
    "the noise is plotted at the same three values of @xmath150 .",
    "the correspondence between the plot - line styles and the interaction parameters follow the same convention as in the plots for the current ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "figs.[fig : noise1]-[fig : noise3 ] show that the noise is suppressed by interaction in the leads .",
    "this is expected since interaction in the leads causes tunneling events to be more correlated .",
    "the increase in correlation among subsequent tunneling events leads to decreased fluctuations and hence decreased current noise .    in figs.[fig : fano1]-[fig : fano3 ] , we plot the current - normalized dc noise , or the fano factor @xmath166 , @xmath167 for all values of @xmath150 , electron interaction in the leads results in an increase in @xmath166 .",
    "the plots also show that @xmath166 depends dramatically on @xmath150 .",
    "in particular , @xmath166 grows rapidly as @xmath150 increases @xcite , and is found to be super - poissonian for @xmath168 ( see fig.[fig : fano3 ] ) .",
    "fig.[fig : noise4 ] plots the noise at a higher temperature , @xmath169 .",
    "raising the temperature has a similar qualitative effect on the noise as increasing the interaction in the leads ; the steps in the noise curve are smeared out and the plateaus between steps acquire a slope .",
    "however , the overall noise amplitude does not change when the temperature is raised while the amplitude decreases when the interaction is introduced .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the steady state current and the dc noise characteristics of a single level quantum dot coupled to two luttinger liquid leads .",
    "in particular , we studied how the electron interaction in the leads and the coupling between tunneling electrons and on - dot phonons affect the dot s transport properties .",
    "we considered both equilibrium and out - of - equilibrium phonon distributions , and both symmetric and asymmetric bias orientations .",
    "the density matrix formalism was used to harness both phonon distributions in our calculations and to derive the semi - classical rate equation for the dot occupational probabilities .",
    "the calculations were done in the high - temperature approximation , in which the electron tunneling rate was assumed to be small enough so that the dot charge fluctuations are insignificant .    we have found that interaction in the leads in general suppresses the overall tunneling current and the noise , and smears out the steps in the @xmath75-@xmath170 characteristics .",
    "this effect is mainly a consequence of the luttinger - liquid correlation in the leads .",
    "the change in the phonon distribution of the dot due to electron - electron interaction in the leads is relatively small albeit we can see a slight narrowing of the phonon distribution as the interaction strength is increased , leading to only a minor contribution to the changes in current and noise . comparing these behaviours of the current and noise with the effect of increased temperature , we find that increasing the temperature does not suppress overall current and noise even though it smears out the steps in @xmath75-@xmath170 and noise characteristics .",
    "it is also found that the fano factor , that represents the noise normalized by the current , becomes enhanced as the intralead electron interaction gets bigger .",
    "the fano factor increases rapidly as the electron - phonon interaction becomes stronger and , interestingly , shows super - poissonian behaviour as the electron - phonon coupling becomes greater than order one .    * acknowledgement * : this work was supported by the nserc of canada , canadian institute for advanced research , canada research chair program , and ogs .",

    "<S> we study the effects of electron - phonon interactions on the transport properties of a molecular quantum dot coupled to two luttinger - liquid leads . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we investigate the effects on the steady state current and dc noise characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> we consider both equilibrated and unequilibrated on - dot phonons . </S>",
    "<S> the density matrix formalism is applied in the high temperature approximation and the resulting semi - classical rate equation is numerically solved for various strengths of electron - electron interactions in the leads and electron - phonon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the current and the noise are in general smeared out and suppressed due to intralead electron interaction . on the other hand , the fano factor , which measures the noise normalized by the current , </S>",
    "<S> is more enhanced as the intralead interaction becomes stronger . as the electron - phonon coupling becomes greater than order one , the fano factor exhibits super - poissonian behaviour . </S>"
