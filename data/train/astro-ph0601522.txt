    "for more than two decades , significant effort has been spent attempting to understand the triggering mechanism of quasar activity , as well as the relation between quasars and their host galaxies . since @xcite , it has become widely accepted that quasars are fueled by accretion of gas onto super - massive black holes .",
    "observations have shown that a number of nearby galaxies have a central black hole whose mass correlates with the luminosity of the spheroid of the host galaxy .",
    "this connection suggests that the formation of the black hole is linked to the formation of the galaxy which , in turn , is known to strongly depend on its environment . to develop a better understanding of the quasar phenomenon",
    ", it is therefore important to investigate and quantify the relation between quasars and their environments . despite the importance of this issue",
    ", our knowledge of the quasar environment is still limited .",
    "quasar environments have been studied on different scales ranging from those of the host galaxy to those of large scales .",
    "such studies have provided important but controversial results regarding the environment of quasars .",
    "it has been known for more than three decades that quasars are associated with enhancements in the spatial distribution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "studies have shown that , in the nearby universe , quasars reside in environments ranging from small to moderate groups of galaxies rather than in rich clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "early observations of quasar environments @xcite , revealed a positive association of bright quasars with neighboring galaxies at a level somewhat higher than that of normal galaxies and comparable to the environment of small- to intermediate - richness groups of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "observations of quasar environment from the hubble space telescope snapshot survey @xcite further support this density enhancement around bright quasars . all these observations focused on small scales , typically within @xmath12mpc of the quasars , and used relatively small samples of objects .",
    "early observations of the clustering properties of quasars themselves , as measured by the quasar auto - correlation function , suggest that quasars are significantly more strongly clustered than galaxies on scales up to @xmath13mpc and greater ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but less clustered than rich clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this finding suggests that quasars are located in high overdensity regions , more so than @xmath0 galaxies , since higher overdensity regions are clustered more strongly than lower overdensity regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an overdense environment would indeed be expected if the quasar activity was triggered by galaxy interactions .    on the other hand , new generation surveys , such as the two degree field ( 2df ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ,",
    "have given rise to different results .",
    "using significantly larger complete samples of quasars and galaxies , these surveys have shown that on large scales , i.e. from 1 to @xmath13mpc , the quasar - galaxy cross - correlation and the quasar auto - correlation are comparable to the correlation function of @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "this suggests , in conflict with previous results , that quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) inhabit environments similar to those of @xmath0 galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results also suggest that the quasar correlation function does not depend significantly on either quasar luminosity or redshift within the ranges studied .",
    "recent work on sub - mpc scales using the sdss to find quasar pairs suggests that the quasar - quasar auto - correlation function may be enhanced relative to the galaxy - galaxy distribution @xcite , consistent with the earlier results on small scales , as discussed above .",
    "in this paper we use the sdss survey to determine the galaxy environment around quasars as a function of scale .",
    "the sdss is uniquely suited for this investigation : it is the largest complete survey available of both galaxies and quasars , carried out in a well - calibrated , self - consistent manner .",
    "the data used in this study covers 4000 deg@xmath14 , with @xmath15 quasars of redshift @xmath16 and ten million photometric galaxies to a magnitude limit of @xmath17 .",
    "we use these data to determine the mean galactic environment around quasars as a function of quasar luminosity and redshift . for comparison , the same analysis",
    "is then repeated to find the local environment around @xmath18 spectroscopic galaxies in the sdss area , as well as around random positions in the survey .",
    "all the analyses are carried out using the same ten million photometric galaxies .",
    "this technique allows a direct comparison between the environment around quasars with that around random points as well as with the environment around @xmath0 galaxies , thereby minimizing potential selection effects and systematics .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : we discuss the data in section  [ sec.data ] , the analysis in section  [ sec.analysis ] , and the results in section  [ sec.results ] .",

    "the high quality imaging and spectroscopic survey of quasars and galaxies provides a unique data set for studying the environment of quasars and comparing it directly with the environment of galaxies . to do so",

    "in addition to the quasars , we use a sample of spectroscopic galaxies as targets in our analysis so that we may compare the environment of quasars with that of galaxies . the spectroscopic galaxy sample used for comparison",

    "our galaxy sample has a median redshift of 0.13 and a median magnitude of @xmath41 , and our quasar sample has a median redshift of 0.32 and a median magnitude of @xmath42 .",
    "the environment of the above targets - spectroscopic quasars and spectroscopic galaxies - is then determined using the photometric galaxies from dr3 of the sdss imaging survey .",
    "we use a sample of over 10 million galaxies with magnitude in the range @xmath43 . for further comparison",
    ", we also repeat the environment analysis at approximately @xmath44 random positions per target using the same method and background sample of photometric galaxies .",
    "all samples were corrected using the same masks , which remove missing fields , missing stripes , and regions where the stripe boundaries extend beyond the extent of the photometric galaxy survey .",
    "these masks were created with sdsspixel , a pixelization scheme routinely applied to the sdss data .",
    "we also remove all targets ( i.e. , quasars , spectroscopic galaxies , and random points ) that are closer than @xmath45mpc to the boundary or to a mask in the photometric sample in order to ensure that all targets have a complete field of photometric galaxies within the scales of interest .",
    "we study the environment of the spectroscopic targets ( quasars and galaxies ) by determining the number of photometric galaxies within different projected radii from the quasars , from @xmath46kpc to @xmath45mpc ( @xmath47 ) . in order to normalize the density of photometric galaxies",

    "this latter comparison yields normalized overdensities , i.e. , observed density over random density , for both the quasars and the spectroscopic galaxies .",
    "this technique then allows a direct comparison of the density of galaxies around spectroscopic targets .    throughout the analysis",
    ", we treat all of these targets - quasars , spectroscopic galaxies , and random points - in exactly the same manner in order to provide a direct and straightforward comparison between the environment of quasars , galaxies , and random positions , and help minimize potential biases . for each of the targets",
