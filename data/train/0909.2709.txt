    "there has been much recent interest in the possibility of pulsars near the galactic center@xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that radio telescopes may receive pulsar beams that have passed close to the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in sgr a*. in an earlier paper@xcite , hereafter `` paper i , '' we showed how such observations would encode information about the strong field region near the smbh . in a separate paper@xcite",
    "we discuss what observational program will be appropriate to search for pulsar beams deflected by the smbh in sgr a@xmath3 .    in paper i we simplified the analysis by assuming that the smbh in sgr a * is not rotating .",
    "it is not plausible , of course , for the hole to be strictly nonrotating , but it is likely that the rotation rate is of order @xmath4@xcite , rather than close to the extremal limit @xmath5 .",
    "( here and throughout we adopt the conventions that @xmath6 . ) the most significant effect of rotation will be to allow prograde photon orbits to come closer to the horizon without being captured , and to require retrograde orbits to be further from the horizon .",
    "an estimate of the effect can be made relatively easily for photon orbits in the equatorial plane of a kerr hole , for photons that are prograde ( orbital angular momentum aligned with the hole s spin angular momentum ) and retrograde ( angular momenta anti - aligned ) .",
    "for emission of equatorial photons at a ( boyer - lindquist ) radial coordinate @xmath7 around a hole with @xmath8 , the critical angle for a prograde photon is the same as if it were emitted at radius @xmath9 near a schwarzschild hole ; for a retrograde photon the critical angle is the same as that for a photon emitted at radius @xmath10 around a schwarzschild hole .",
    "a more complete analysis of spin effects will be deferred to a later paper ; for now we note that while spin effects are non - negligible , they will not be dominant .",
    "while keeping in mind its limitations , we use the nonrotating assumption due to its great simplification .",
    "as shown in paper i , for a nonrotating hole all black hole effects on a pulsar beam are contained in two relatively simple functions , one of which , @xmath11 , describes the bending of the pulsar beam due to gravitational effects , while the other , @xmath12 , describes the gravitational and geometric time delay . in these functions @xmath13 is the angle , with respect to the direction radially away from the smbh , at which the pulsar beam is emitted in the astronomical ( not the comoving ) frame .",
    "these functions are parameterized only by @xmath14 the schwarzschild radial coordinate location @xmath15 of the emission event in units of the geometrized mass @xmath16 .",
    "it is this simplification that distinguishes our approach from those of others who have studied the problem both with further approximations and with more numerically intensive investigations @xcite .          the basic geometry of our model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] . at the event of emission ,",
    "the radial distance from the smbh ( as measured by the schwarzschild radial coordinate ) is @xmath15 , to describe the beam , we go to the frame of the pulsar , the frame in which physical processes produce the beam . in this frame",
    "the pulsar spin axis is at an angle @xmath17 above the orbital plane , and the angle @xmath18 describes the location of elements of the beam relative to the pulsar spin axis . the rapidly rotating beam is confined to a conical region extending around the spin axis from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "we will use the term `` beam cone '' to refer to this region .",
    "we note at the outset that it is often useful to view the problem of beam propagaton from the changing location of ( but not in the frame of ) the pulsar .",
    "that is , at any time we will see things from the point of view of an observer at rest in the astronomical rest frame at the location of the pulsar .",
    "for this observer , the distant stars and the distant earth will remain in fixed angular positions , but the smbh will move in an orbit ( not necessarily a circular , or even closed orbit ) .",
    "sections [ sec : keyholes ] and [ sec : annulus ] give a general framework for understanding the geometry of strong field effects .",
    "these two sections separate the problem into two parts . the first part , that in sec .",
    "[ sec : keyholes ] , deals with the geometrical relationship of the pulsar location , smbh location and earth location . for any such relationship",
    "we establish a `` keyhole '' direction , a direction in which radiation from the pulsar , i.e. , part of the pulsar beam , will be gravitationally bent so that it is directed to the earth . the second part of the geometry , that of sec .",
    "[ sec : annulus ] , deals with the directions of pulsar beaming . due to the aberration of photon directions ( the `` headlight effect '' ) these directions",
    "depend not only on the configuration parameters @xmath17 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , but also on the velocity of the pulsar motion . for any model , and any pulsar velocity ,",
    "this gives us an annulus of beaming .",
    "the beaming will reach the earth if the keyhole position falls within the beaming annulus . in sec .",
    "[ sec : scenarios ] we put together the techniques of the previous two sections to show the observational results for a particular astrophysical model .",
    "a summary and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "for a given location of the earth , at any moment in the orbit of the pulsar there is a given direction for a photon that will follow an smbh - deflected orbit and end up at the earth .",
    "we call this the _ keyhole _ direction .",
    "this direction is found using the universal function @xmath11 of paper i. if the keyhole direction overlaps the beam cone in which the pulsar is actually sending energy , then there will be a pulse sent off towards the earth roughly once per rotation .",
    "the precise times of pulse emission and reception are then found from the assumptions about the pulsar , and from @xmath12 , the second universal function in paper i. the issues of overlap with the beam cone , and of timing , will be taken up in the subsequent two sections . here",
    "we focus only on the calculation of the keyhole direction .",
    "we use polar coordinates with the orbital plane of the pulsar - smbh system defining the equator of the coordinate system , and with directions specified by longitude and latitude coordinates @xmath23 . in this coordinate system",
    "the earth has some fixed location @xmath24 .",
    "we define our coordinate system to be a global inertial coordinate system whose origin is instantaneously centered on the pulsar at the time of emission of any given photon .",
    "thus every photon trajectory starts at the origin , and the smbh position is fixed for any photon trajectory , but the black hole moves around the origin as a function of emission time .    at any time the configuration of the system can be defined by the longitude @xmath25 of the smbh ( relative to the earth ) and the latitude @xmath26 of the earth ( relative to the orbital plane ) .",
    "any photon traveling from the pulsar to the earth must do so on a plane containing the earth , the pulsar , and the smbh .",
    "this defines a great circle in our coordinate system , with an angular separation @xmath27 between the earth and the smbh , given by @xmath28 , as shown in figure  [ fig : trajectory](a ) . to find the keyhole direction ,",
    "we must find the corresponding angle @xmath29 , that is , the initial photon direction relative to the pulsar - smbh axis .",
    "figure  [ fig : trajectory](b ) shows the photon trajectory within the trajectory plane , labeling the initial and outgoing photon directions @xmath30 and @xmath31 according to the conventions in paper i. given @xmath27 above , we find @xmath32 .",
    "we can then compute @xmath30 by numerically inverting the first universal function @xmath33 for the pulsar - smbh separation @xmath15 at the time of emission .",
    "we next compute @xmath34 .",
    "lastly , the longitude @xmath35 and latitude @xmath36 of the keyhole are obtained by spherical geometry .",
    "if a pulsar beam is significantly deflected , it will be spread out in the plane of the photon trajectory .",
    "as discussed in paper i , this leads to a change in the received beam strength by the intensity amplification factor @xmath37",
    "this amplification factor depends only on @xmath13 , and hence only on the pulsar - smbh - earth configuration because it omits the red / blueshift effects due to the pulsar motion .",
    "those effects , in any case , are usually very small compared to geometrical effects .",
    "it should be noted that the keyhole direction is not unique ; adding multiples @xmath38 to @xmath31 , with integer @xmath39 , gives the same outgoing direction , but inverting the universal function yields a different initial angle @xmath30 .",
    "these correspond to photon trajectories that orbit the smbh one or more times in a prograde or retrograde sense before emerging in the desired direction .",
    "in general , @xmath40 corresponds to the `` direct '' ( least - bent ) path .",
    "for @xmath41 the @xmath42 beam is the most significant of the more strongly - bent paths ( passing around the smbh in the opposite sense to the direct path ) , and @xmath43 is the path that completes one full orbit in the same sense as the direct path , and so on .",
    "our final algorithm for computing the keyhole direction @xmath44 for a given smbh longitude @xmath25 and earth longitude and latitude @xmath45 can be reduced to the following equations , @xmath46\\,,\\label{algorithm4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is ( as in some programming languages ) the inverse trig function returning the argument of @xmath48 in the correct quadrant .",
    "figure  [ fig : windings ] gives a map of keyhole positions for earth location @xmath49 ( shown as a blue @xmath50 ) , for all possible smbh longitudes @xmath51 , assuming @xmath52 .",
    "since each keyhole position corresponds to a specific @xmath30 , we also compute the intensity attenuation or amplification given in eq .  , and color the keyhole point accordingly .",
    "this lets us see immediately which photon paths will be interesting ( i.e.  not too attenuated by bending ) .",
    "also plotted are gray curves of the great circles corresponding to the trajectory plane , shown for every @xmath53 in @xmath51 . the way to read",
    "the graph is as follows : for any given smbh position , find the gray curve connecting it to the earth .",
    "this is the trajectory plane of photons that can reach the earth for that smbh position .",
    "find where that curve intersects one of the colored keyhole curves .",
    "that intersection indicates the keyhole location : the initial direction in which photons must be beamed to reach the earth .",
    "the color indicates the relative geometric attenuation of photons traveling along that path .",
    "we can clearly see the direct paths ( the red loop ) , the most gently bent indirect paths ( brown line ) , and more highly - wound paths : there is a countably infinite number of such possible highly - wound paths , but the amplification factor become exponentially small with increasing windings .    in figure",
    "[ fig : keyholes ] we focus our attention on the `` @xmath42 '' trajectories , the most significant and gently bent of the `` indirect '' beam paths . in this case , colors denote the pulsar - smbh distance @xmath15 , as indicated .",
    "keyhole maps are shown for @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "note that for sufficiently small @xmath15 and @xmath26 the simple one - to - one relationship between smbh and keyhole positions in figure  [ fig : windings ] breaks down .",
    "this occurs when there is a smbh position ( relative to the pulsar ) such that a beam aimed directly away from the earth is bent around to point to the earth .",
    "in such a situation , due to symmetry about the earth - pulsar line , there will in fact be two smbh positions ( relative to the pulsar ) that will give the same deflection . from the pulsar s perspective , as the smbh orbits it , the keyhole describes a loop in the sky starting from the anti - earth direction .",

    "in our model system , the pulsar is assumed to emit its beam in a conical region of angular width @xmath22 as shown in fig .  [",

    "we must find the location of this region in the `` astronomical frame , '' the frame in which the smbh is at rest .",
    "it is in this astronomical frame that we can infer the angle @xmath2 that is the input to the universal functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the relationship between the emission direction in the pulsar frame and the emission direction in the astronomical frame involves a rotational transformation and a lorentz boost .",

    "[ fig : sphere2 ] .",

    "[ fig : sphere2 ] .",
    "calculation of the aberration and rotation do not need to assume anything about the pulsar orbit ( or about the smbh orbit from the viewpoint of the pulsar ) , but it can be intuitively useful to consider the smbh to be in a circular orbit around the pulsar , with radius @xmath15 and at azimuthal position @xmath61 , as indicated in fig .

    "the translation back and forth between the specification of @xmath60 and of the pair of parameters @xmath62 is simple and straightforward . what should be noted in particular",

    "we start in the unprimed system , the system aligned with the pulsar spin axis , and in which the pulsar is at rest . in this system",
    "we introduce the parameter @xmath67 to describe the phase of beam rotation , so that at any one instant the direction of the beam is specified by the unit vector @xmath68 with components @xmath69 .",
    "we find the components @xmath70 in the @xmath71 coordinate basis using @xmath72 , where @xmath73 from which we get @xmath74    for a photon of energy @xmath75 , moving in the @xmath68 direction , the components of the 4-momentum in the @xmath71 frame are @xmath76 if the velocity of the smbh in the pulsar rest frame has components @xmath77 then the 4-momentum components @xmath78 in the astronomical frame , the frame in which the smbh is stationary , are given by @xmath79 where , in general , @xmath80 if we assume a circular orbit for the black hole , with speed @xmath81 , then @xmath82 . with these velocity components the matrix of eq",

    "the time for @xmath67 to go from 0 to @xmath91 ( i.e. , the pulsar spin period ) is many orders of magnitudes smaller than the time for @xmath61 to go from 0 to @xmath91 ( i.e. , the orbital time ) .",
    "we can therefore take @xmath61 to be constant while the pulsar beam traces out a closed path . in this way",

    "we have set down the principles and the methods of calculation for analyzing the observational effects of a nonspinning black hole on a pulsar signals . in particular , we have shown that the calculation of pulse timing and intensity involves solving two problems simultaneously : that of the the beam annulus distorted by aberration , and that of the keyhole position and trajectory . once these calculations are done , one can quickly infer the strong field effect on the pulse period and the beam attenuation for any epoch of motion .",
    "the beam annulus computation starts with the pulsar s beam details : the direction of its spin axis , and the orientation and width of its radio beam .",
    "photon directions , most naturally specified in the frame of the pulsar , must then be transformed to the astronomical frame so that aberration effects are taken into account .",
    "the algorithm for doing this is set down in sec .",

    ", the keyhole direction is the photon emission direction ( in the astronomical frame ) for which a photon will be deflected towards the earth .",
    "this direction must lie in the pulsar - smbh - earth plane , and the necessary deflection angle is determined by the pulsar - smbh - earth angles in that plane . the keyhole direction in that plane",
    "is inferred from the deflection angle by inverting the universal function @xmath93 developed in paper i. the specific calculational steps are given in eqs .   .",
    "the relative simplicity of this method is the main motivation for ignoring the rotation of the smbh .",
    "once the pulsar trajectory is specified , the two parts of the analysis are brought together .",
    "for any pulsar - smbh - earth alignment , it is determined whether the keyhole overlaps the beam annulus .",
    "since the beam annulus shape , due to aberration effects , depends on the pulsar velocity , the shape must be calculated for each new position of the pulsar .",
    "though the use of the universal function greatly simplifies the calculations , the exploration of the parameter space for pulsars in sgr a@xmath3 is still inconveniently broad .",
    "this is particularly true because pulsar orbits near srg a@xmath3 may be highly eccentric , thereby adding to the already large set of parameters that constitute a model .",
    "a minor but useful simplification is to ignore the aberration effects on the beam annulus , so that the beam annulus is fixed in the astronomical frame once and for all .",
    "( precession of the pulsar spin axis is also ignored . )",
    "the aberration , in any case , is of order of the pulsar velocity divided by @xmath94 , and will be small .",
    "we have seen that the effects are small with the choice we have made , @xmath95 for the model in secs .",
    "[ sec : annulus ] and [ sec : scenarios ] . yet , even for orbits of high eccentricity , @xmath95 , a velocity @xmath96 is much more relativistic than what is likely to be the case for pulsars that are beaming past the smbh .",
    "a more detailed discussion of plausible astrophysical models will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we only point out that an epoch of observability will typically be of order of 10@xmath97 or more of the pulsar orbit .",
    "this translates to millions of seconds for the most tightly bound pulsars in the galactic center .",
    "since pulsar spin periods are typically less than , or much less than a second , the pulse train for an epoch of observability will involve a large number of pulses .",
    "the timing and intensity patterns of that pulse train can reveal much about the strong field region through which the pulses traveled .",
