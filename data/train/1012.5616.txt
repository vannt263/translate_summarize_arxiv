    "quantum squeezing is an irreducible resource for the universal quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "quantum squeezed states are states with variance of a quadrature below the vacuum noise .",
    "although the squeezed states are non - classical , as they have no regular and positive glauber - sudarshan quasi - probability distribution , their non - classicality still can be simulated by the semiclassical methods .",
    "it results from the fact that squeezing is simply observable in a gaussian approximation , since the squeezed states are there represented by the positive and regular wigner functions which then play the role of probability distributions .",
    "such the wigner function of a squeezed state can be simply obtained by deforming the stochastic phase - space evolution of an irreducible vacuum state @xcite .",
    "it does not prevent , for example , quantum key distribution for a limited distance , but it does not allow universal quantum computing @xcite",
    ". on the other hand , non - classicality substantially reflecting a discrete particle structure of quantum states can not be efficiently simulated by these stochastic methods @xcite .",
    "the corresponding wigner function of the particle - like state can exhibit negative values , breaking its interpretation as any kind of classical probability density .",
    "the negative values are considered as a clear experimental witness of quantum features beyond the semiclassical description @xcite .",
    "both the long - distance quantum key distribution and quantum computing can not be performed solely based on the squeezing resource .",
    "the highly non - classical repeaters in the sequential teleportation protocol @xcite or many highly non - classical cubic phase gates @xcite in a complex quantum computer change propagating states to non - gaussian states with a negative wigner function . in both the cases ,",
    "the teleportation of the negative wigner function with just the squeezing as a resource is a basic element of the communication and computation tasks . in the efficient quantum key distribution with quantum repeaters ,",
    "the gaussian teleportation should , at least _ probabilistically _ , allow to propagate the negativity of the wigner function produced by the repeater operation through the network towards the next quantum repeater .",
    "in quantum computation , it should even _ deterministically _ implement basic highly nonlinear cubic phase gate @xcite , if such the off - line gate is , at least probabilistically , feasible .",
    "the quality of teleportation is mainly limited by the finite squeezing resource . how much squeezing resource",
    "is actually required to at least partially keep the negativity of the wigner function through the teleportation step ?",
    "the answer to this question tells how much of the squeezing is necessary to decompose higher non - classical states .",
    "since the teleportation is the basic primitive for the quantum communication and computation , it specifies also an amount of the squeezing needed to deterministically ( or probabilistically ) operate highly non - classical states . in this paper",
    ", we give a clear and illustrative answer to this basic question . as a first testing state , the single - photon fock state having maximal possible negativity of the wigner function is considered at the input of teleportation .",
    "the negativity is then lowered by a loss implemented on the single - photon state .",
    "our attempt is to directly show the effect of the gaussian teleportation on the different values of negativity of the wigner function , thus judging its possible application in the long - distance quantum communication and quantum cryptography .",

    "it corresponds to squeezing -3 db required in the entanglement preparation .",
    "however , fidelity does not directly tell if the teleported state has still some negativity of wigner function and how large it is .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the capability of the standard teleportation protocol @xcite to successfully teleport negativity of the wigner function in the origin of the single - photon fock state and the convex mixture of the state with the vacuum state .",
    "our goal is to find teleportation protocols minimizing the value of the output wigner in the origin .",
    "we find that for the single - photon fock state an arbitrarily small nonzero squeezing suffices to successfully teleport negative value of the wigner function in the origin if the gain of teleportation is chosen suitably .",
    "in contrast , in order to teleport negative value of the wigner function in the origin of the attenuated single - photon fock state one has to surpass a strict threshold level of squeezing . for both the cases of input states one can attain substantially larger negative value of the output wigner function in the origin by using conditional teleportation with reasonably high success probability .",
    "the post - selection can not improve the squeezing threshold , however , if it is surpassed , a higher negativity of the wigner function can be achieved . a sufficient tolerance of the conditional teleportation to impurity of the squeezed states used to produce the shared entangled state demonstrates the feasibility of the conditional teleportation .",

    "using eq .",
    "( [ vthetabeta0 ] ) we then get the threshold squeezed variance @xmath215 equal to -8.82 db and it approaches @xmath231 equal to -8.85 db with increasing noise excess .",
    "we studied teleportation of a pure single - photon fock state and a mixed attenuated single - photon fock state by the standard continuous - variable teleportation protocol @xcite .",
    "we optimized analytically the gain of the teleportation such in order to minimize the output wigner function in the origin . for the single - photon fock state we found that an arbitrarily weak squeezing used to create the shared entangled state is sufficient for successful teleportation of the negative value of its wigner function in the origin .",
    "for an attenuated single - photon state we have shown that there is a strict bound on the squeezing that has to be overcome in order to have the output wigner function in the origin negative . in both cases the negative value of the output wigner function in the origin",
    "can be increased by using a conditional teleportation with a reasonably high success rate . however , in the case of the attenuated single - photon state , the bound on squeezing one has to surpass to observe negative output wigner function is the same for both unconditional and conditional teleportation and its initial value can be reached only asymptotically in the limit of a high squeezing .",
    "finally , we took into account noise excess in the anti - squeezing and we have shown that conditional teleportation of a negative wigner function exhibits strong tolerance to the noise excess .",
    "now , let us discuss the consequences of our observations for the quantum computation and the quantum communication .",
    "for quantum computation , the quantum teleportation was considered as a possible scenario how to make _ deterministic _ operation on an unknown arbitrary quantum state .",
    "a basic requirement is to be able to preserve negativity of the wigner function through the operation , in our simplest case through the teleportation .",
    "therefore , we can take the preservation of the negativity as a necessary condition for the quantum gate performance .",
    "we observed that to preserve the negativity of the winger function , either the input state has to be very close to a single - photon state , or for the imperfect single - photon state ( the attenuated version ) , an extremely high squeezing is required .",
    "if the negativity of the wigner function should be preserved ( for example , at @xmath232 of its original value ) , the requirement is even more demanding .",
    "clearly , it is very important to protect the input state against even the loss , since it substantially increases the demand on the required squeezing for the teleportation . in summary , the cost ( squeezing required to prepare entangled state in the teleportation ) is quite high to implement the operation in this measurement - induced way .",
    "it can stimulate further increasing of the squeezing in the experiments , but this resource seems to be also practically limited .    on the other hand , for quantum communication with the repeaters , the preservation of negativity of the wigner function through the gaussian teleportation seems to be just a reasonable condition to efficiently extend the quantum key distribution between the two distant repeaters .",
    "further , it is enough to implement the _ conditional _ teleportation , since the key distribution is anyway probabilistic protocol .",
    "the required minimal squeezing to keep the negativity of the wigner function is practically not changed by the post - selections . however , for almost perfect single - photon state , the threshold squeezing is low and the input negativity of the wigner function can be archived for the experimentally feasible values of squeezing ( up to -10 db of squeezing ) .",
    "advantageously , for the strongly attenuated single - photon state , the post - selection improves the value of the negativity up to a maximum for the given squeezing used to produce entanglement . however , to reach the original value , the post - selection has to be combined with the enhancement of the squeezing . in summary , the cost ( squeezing required to prepare entangled state in the teleportation ) is lower for the communication application of the teleportation of highly non - classical states , if the negativity of the wigner function is already preserved by teleportation .",
    "finally , we want to point out one important issue .",
    "since the teleportation with finite squeezing always lowers the negativity of the wigner function , any next teleportation will transfer already an imperfect version of the highly non - classical state and the squeezing threshold ( or squeezing required to almost maintain the negativity ) will become more demanding for the implementation .",
    "it means that small imperfections or errors are actually amplified through multiple gaussian teleportations and any correction mechanism ( quantum error correction or quantum repeater ) has to be applied very frequently and very efficiently to keep the threshold squeezing in the feasible range to be able to transmit the negativity of the wigner function .",
