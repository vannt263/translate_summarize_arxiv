    "there is growing evidence that soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) belong to the same class of objects , _ magnetars _ , which are warm , isolated slowly rotating neutron stars of age @xmath3 yr with unusually strong magnetic fields , @xmath4  g ( see , e.g. , @xcite , for a recent review ) .",
    "there have been attempts to explain the activity of these sources and the high level of their x - ray emission by the release of the magnetic energy in their interiors but a reliable theory is still absent .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the thermal evolution of magnetars as cooling isolated neutron stars .",
    "we do not attempt to construct a self - consistent theory of the magnetars but instead address the problem phenomenologically .",
    "we show that magnetars are too hot to be treated as purely cooling neutron stars ; they require some heating source , which we assume operates in their interiors .",
    "our aim is to analyze the location and power of the heating source that are consistent with observed thermal luminosities of sgrs and axps and with the energy budget of an isolated neutron star .",
    "we use our general relativistic cooling code ( gnedin , yakovlev & potekhin 2001 ) .",
    "it simulates the thermal evolution of an initially hot isolated neutron star taking into account heat outflow via neutrino emission from the star and via thermal conduction within the star , with subsequent thermal photon emission from the surface . to facilitate calculations ,",
    "the star is artificially divided ( e.g. , @xcite ) into a thin outer heat blanketing envelope ( extending from the surface to the layer of density @xmath5 g  @xmath1 , with the thickness of a few hundred meters ) , and the bulk interior ( from @xmath6 to the center ) . in the bulk interior",
    "the code solves the full set of equations of thermal evolution in the spherically symmetric approximation , neglecting the effects of magnetic fields on thermal conduction and neutrino emission . in the blanketing envelope",
    "the code uses the solution of the stationary thermal conduction problem obtained in the approximation of a thin plane - parallel layer for a dipole magnetic field configuration .",
    "this solution relates temperature @xmath7 at the base of the blanketing envelope ( @xmath8 ) to the effective surface temperature @xmath9 properly averaged over the neutron star surface ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in the code",
    "we have mainly used the @xmath10 relation obtained specifically for the present study , assuming @xmath11  g  @xmath1 and the magnetized blanketing envelope made of iron .",
    "magnetars are hot and have large temperature gradients extending deeply into the heat blanketing envelope .",
    "thus even high magnetic fields do not dramatically affect the overall thermal conduction in the envelope and the @xmath10 relation ( as discussed , e.g. , by @xcite ) .",
    "since magnetars are hot inside , these fields should not greatly affect heat transport in the bulk of the star ( at @xmath12 ) .",
    "this justifies the approximation of spherically symmetric temperature distribution at @xmath13 . at lower temperatures",
    "the electron thermal conductivity in the interior becomes strongly anisotropic and such an approximation can be questionable @xcite .",
    "our standard cooling code includes the effects of magnetic fields only in the blanketing envelope . in this",
    "respect our present model of the blanketing envelope with @xmath11  g  @xmath1 seems less adequate than the previous model with @xmath14  g  @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , the latter model , by construction , neglects neutrino emission from the blanketing envelope . because the neutrino emission from the layers with @xmath15  g  @xmath1 in hot magnetars is important ( section [ results ] ) , the blanketing envelope with @xmath11  g  @xmath1 is expected to be more appropriate for the present investigation . that is why we have performed calculations with this latter model but have done additional tests using the model with @xmath16  g  @xmath1 ( section [ tests ] ) .",
    "we have also included , in a phenomenological manner , the effects of magnetic fields on the thermal evolution of the bulk stellar interior .",
    "most importantly , we have introduced a heat source located within a spherical layer in the interior ( it can be associated with the magnetic field , section [ nature ] ) .",
    "the heating rate @xmath17 [ ] has been taken in the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the maximum heat intensity , @xmath20 is a step - like function ( @xmath21 within the density interval @xmath22 ; @xmath23 outside this interval , with a sharp but continuous transitions at the interval boundaries ) , @xmath24 is the star s age , and @xmath25 is the life time of the heating source",
    ". a specific form of @xmath17 is not important for our main conclusions .",
    "we do not specify the nature of this source .",
    "we set @xmath26 years to explain high thermal states of all observed sgrs and axps ( section [ results ] ) .",
    "we do not consider longer @xmath25 which would require higher energy budget ( while the budget is already severely restricted even for @xmath26 years ) .",
    "we treat @xmath19 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 as free parameters with the aim to understand what the intensity and the location of the heat source should be in order to be consistent with observations and with the energy budget of an isolated neutron star .",
    "it is instructive to introduce the total heat power @xmath29 [ erg  s@xmath30 , redshifted for a distant observer , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the proper volume element , and @xmath33 is the redshift metric function .    in the neutron star core",
    "we use the equation of state of dense matter constructed by @xcite ( model argon v18 + @xmath34 + uix@xmath35 ) ; it is currently considered the most elaborated equation of state of neutron star matter .",
    "specifically , we employ a convenient parameterization of this equation of state proposed by @xcite and described as apr  iii by @xcite . according to this equation of state ,",
    "neutron star cores consist of neutrons , protons , electrons , and muons .",
    "the maximum ( gravitational ) neutron star mass is @xmath36 . the powerful direct urca process of neutrino emission @xcite is allowed only in the central kernels of massive neutron stars with @xmath37 ( at densities @xmath38 g  @xmath1 ) .",
    "we use neutron star models with two masses , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41 model is an example of a star with standard ( not too strong ) neutrino emission in the core ( provided by the modified urca process in a non - superfluid star ) . in this case",
    "the ( circumferential ) stellar radius is @xmath42  km , and the central density is @xmath43  g  @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath44 model ( @xmath45  km , @xmath46  g  @xmath1 ) is an example of a star whose neutrino emission is enhanced by the direct urca process in the inner core .    we have updated the thermal conductivity of electrons and muons in the stellar core by new results ( p.  s.  shternin & d.  g.  yakovlev 2006 , in preparation ) which take into account the landau damping of transverse plasmons in the interaction of electrons and muons with surrounding charged particles ( following the results for quark plasma obtained by @xcite ) .",
    "this update has not noticeably affected our cooling scenarios .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the observational basis we take seven sources ( two sgrs and five axps indicated in figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the estimates of their spindown ages @xmath24 , surface magnetic fields @xmath47 and the blackbody surface temperatures @xmath48 ( redshifted for a distant observer ) are taken from tables 14.1 and 14.2 of the review paper by @xcite and from the paper by @xcite .",
    "the data are from the original publications of @xcite ( sgr 052666 ) ; @xcite ( sgr 1900 + 14 ) ; @xcite and @xcite ( 1e 1841045 ) ; @xcite ( cxou j010043.1721134 ) ; @xcite and @xcite ( 1rxs j170849400910 ) ; @xcite and @xcite ( 4u 0142 + 61 ) ; @xcite and @xcite ( 1e 2259 + 586 ) . in the absence of @xmath48 estimates for sgr 162741 we do not include this sgr in our analysis .",
    "we have also excluded sgr 180620 and several axps whose thermal emission component and characteristic age seem less certain .",
    "the radiation from the selected sources has the pulsed fraction @xmath49 .",
    "this indicates that the thermal radiation can be emitted from a substantial part of the surface .",
    "the blackbody surface temperatures @xmath48 of the selected sources are plotted in figure [ fig1 ] versus spindown ages @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite present these data without formal errors , which are actually large .",
    "we introduce , somewhat arbitrarily , the @xmath50 uncertainties into the values of @xmath48 and the uncertainties by a factor of 2 into the values of @xmath24 .",
    "the data are too uncertain and our cooling models are too simplified to explain every source by its own cooling model . instead , we try to explain the existence of magnetars as cooling neutron stars that belong to the `` magnetar box '' , the shaded rectangle in figure [ fig1 ] ( attributed to an average persistent thermal emission from magnetars , excluding bursting states ) .",
    "our results will be sufficiently insensitive to the neutron star mass , and we will mainly use the neutron star model with @xmath39 ( unless the contrary is indicated ) .",
    "similarly , the results will be not too sensitive to superfluid state of stellar interiors and we will mostly neglect the effects of superfluidity of nucleons in the stellar crust and core . to be specific",
    ", we mainly assume the dipole magnetic field in the blanketing envelope with @xmath51  g at the magnetic poles .",
    "some variations of @xmath47 will not affect our principal conclusions ( section [ tests ] ) .    in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the theoretical cooling curves @xmath52 for the 1.4@xmath53 isolated magnetized neutron star without any internal heating .",
    "the solid line refers to a nonsuperfluid neutron star while the dashed line sf is for strong proton superfluidity in the stellar core .",
    "this superfluidity strongly suppresses neutrino emission in the core and noticeably increases @xmath48 at the neutrino cooling stage ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let us stress that the surface temperature of these stars is highly nonuniform , with the magnetic poles being much hotter than the equator . in the figures we plot the average surface temperature ( e.g. , @xcite ) . clearly , the magnetars are much hotter than ordinary cooling neutron stars . the observations of ordinary neutron stars can be explained by the cooling theory without any reheating ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , while the observations of magnetars suggest that the magnetars have additional heat sources .",
    "we assume further that these sources are located inside magnetars . according to alternative models ,",
    "powerful energy sources can be available in magnetar magnetospheres @xcite .",
    "we introduce the internal sources in a phenomenological way described in section [ physics ] .",
    "all results presented below ( figures [ fig2][fig5 ] ) are obtained including the internal heating in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) .",
    "they indicate that the magnetars are hot inside , with the temperature @xmath54  k ( or even higher ) in the crust , at @xmath55  .",
    "such stars are very strong sources of neutrino emission , which is vitally important for the magnetar thermal structure and evolution .    our simulations of cooling neutron stars with a powerful internal heating show that after a short initial relaxation ( @xmath56 years ) the star reaches a quasi - stationary state , which is fully determined by the heating source .",
    "the energy is mainly carried away by neutrinos , but some fraction is transported by thermal conduction to the surface and radiated away by photons .",
    "the interior of these cooling neutron stars is highly non - isothermal .",
    "the hotter layers are those where the heat is released and where the neutrino emission is not too strong ; these layers are located in the crust . the approximation of isothermal interior , which is excellent for ordinary middle - aged neutron stars , can not be used while studying the cooling of magnetars .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig2 ] shows the temperature distribution inside the 1.4@xmath53 star of age @xmath57 years .",
    "this distribution remains the same during the entire magnetar stage ( @xmath58 , see eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) ) and we have chosen @xmath57 years just as an example . we have considered four locations of the heat layer , @xmath59 , summarized in table [ tab : heat ] : ( i ) @xmath60 ( in the outer crust , just below the heat blanketing envelope ) , ( ii ) @xmath61  ( at the top of the inner crust ) , ( iii ) @xmath62  ( at the bottom of the inner crust ) , and ( iv ) @xmath63  ( at the bottom of the inner crust and in the entire core ) .",
    "these locations are marked by hatched rectangles .",
    "the density ranges , which are appropriate to the outer crust , the inner crust and the core , are indicated in the upper part of the figure .",
    "let us remind the reader that the outer crust has a thickness of a few hundred meters and a mass of @xmath64 , the inner crust can be as thick as 1 km and its mass is @xmath65 , while the core is large ( radius @xmath66 km ) and contains @xmath67 of the stellar mass .",
    "therefore , the heating layers i , ii , and iii are relatively thin , while the heating layer iv is wide and includes most of the stellar volume .",
    "we have allowed our heat sources to have two different intensities , @xmath68 and @xmath69 . for illustration , in table [ tab : heat ]",
    "we present also the heating power @xmath29 calculated from eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) for the four layers in the 1.4@xmath53 star of age @xmath57 years at @xmath70 erg s@xmath71 .    in all the cases the neutron star core appears to be much colder than the crust because the core quickly cools down via strong neutrino emission ( via the modified urca process for the conditions in figure [ fig2 ] ) . placing the heat sources far from the heat blanketing envelope is an inefficient way to maintain warm surface ; the heating layer can be hot , but the energy is radiated away by neutrinos and does not flow to the surface .",
    "for the deep heating layers ( cases ii , iii , or iv ) , the heat intensity @xmath72  is clearly insufficient to warm the surface to the magnetar level .",
    "the higher intensity @xmath73 helps but is still less efficient in these layers than in the layer i , which is close to the heat blanketing envelope . for the latter @xmath19 the heating of the crust bottom ( case iii ) and the heating of the entire core ( case iv ) lead to the same surface temperature of the star .",
    "thus , the most efficient way to warm the surface is to place the heating layer in the outer crust , near the heat blanketing envelope .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by figures [ fig3][fig5 ] .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig2 ] shows cooling curves of the 1.4@xmath53 stars for the same models of the heating layer as in the left panel ( with one exception  we do not show the cooling curves for the case iv , for simplicity ) .",
    "the cooling curves of the star of age @xmath74 years are almost horizontal , indicating that these stars maintain their high thermal state owing to the internal heating .",
    "non - horizontal initial parts ( @xmath75 years ) of two curves , which correspond to deep and non - intense heating , show the residual initial relaxation to quasi - stationary thermal states .",
    "one can see that the only way to explain the sources from the `` magnetar box '' is to place the source in the outer crust and assume @xmath76 . as the heating is exponentially switched off at @xmath77 years , following eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) , the surface temperature drops down accordingly .",
    "the magnetar stage is over and the star transforms into the ordinary cooling neutron star @xcite which cools mainly via the surface photon emission .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] compares cooling curves of neutron stars of two masses , 1.4@xmath53 and @xmath44 , for the same three locations i  iii of the heating layer and for one heat intensity @xmath70 .",
    "the thick lines are for the 1.4@xmath53 star ; they are the same as in the right panel of figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the thin lines are the respective curves for the 1.9@xmath53 star , which is a very efficient neutrino emitter because of the direct urca process in its core ( section [ physics ] ) . if the heating layer is in the location ii or iii ( in the inner crust ) , the enhanced neutrino emission from the core of the massive star carries away a substantial amount of heat and decreases the surface temperature of the star .",
    "if , however , the heating layer is placed in the outer crust ( case i ) , direct urca in the core has almost no effect on the surface temperature . in this case",
    "the surface temperature is almost insensitive to the physical conditions in the stellar core and in the inner crust , in particular , to the neutrino emission mechanisms and superfluid state of matter . in other words ,",
    "surface layers are thermally decoupled from the deep interior .",
    "a similar situation occurs in ordinary young and hot cooling stars in the initial cooling stage , before internal thermal relaxation ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this justifies our neglect of the effects of superfluidity in the calculations ( although these effects can be vitally important for ordinary middle - aged cooling neutron stars ; e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] demonstrates sensitivity of the results to the values of the thermal conductivity in the inner neutron star crust .",
    "it shows temperature profiles in the 1.4@xmath53 star of age 1000 years and the cooling curves of this star for one location of the heating layer ( case i ) and one heat intensity @xmath70 .",
    "the thick lines are the same as in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "they are calculated with our standard cooling code assuming only electron thermal conductivity in the crust @xcite . however , in the inner crust thermal energy can also be transported by free neutrons and this transport can be very efficient , especially if neutrons are in a superfluid state .",
    "the effect may be similar to that in superfluid @xmath78he , where no temperature gradients can be created in laboratory experiments because they are immediately smeared out by responding convective flows ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to simulate this effect",
    "we have artificially introduced the layer of high thermal conductivity in the inner neutron star crust , in the density range from @xmath79  to @xmath80 . in this layer",
    "we enhanced the thermal conductivity by a factor of @xmath81 or @xmath82 .",
    "the enhancement changes dramatically the temperature profiles in the inner crust , making it much cooler and almost isothermal .",
    "we have also made one test run by reducing the thermal conductivity in the indicated layer by a factor of @xmath83 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath84 and mainly increases the temperature in the inner crust",
    ". however , all these strong changes of the temperature profiles in the inner crust have almost no effect on the surface temperature and the cooling curves .",
    "it is another manifestation of the thermal decoupling of the surface layers from the inner parts of the star .",
    "in addition , we have simulated the cooling of the star ( the dotted curves ) in the approximation of infinite thermal conductivity everywhere in the star bulk ( @xmath85 ) . in this case the heat energy is instantly spread over the star bulk , which makes the stellar surface much cooler than in the case of finite conduction .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the integrated heating rate @xmath29 , given by eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) ( three upper lines on each panel ) , and the photon thermal surface luminosity of the star @xmath86 ( redshifted for a distant observer , three lower lines on each panel ) as a function of parameters of the heating layers .",
    "the results are presented for the 1.4@xmath53 star of age 1000 years .    in the left panel",
    "we select three locations of the heating layer ( i , ii , iii ) and vary the heat intensity @xmath19 .",
    "one can clearly see that only the heating layer  i can produce @xmath87 erg  s@xmath71 , typical for magnetars .",
    "moreover , the surface luminosity increases with @xmath19 much slower than the heating rate . for @xmath88 and the layers ii and iii , the luminosity is seen to _",
    "saturate_. this means that _ pumping additional heat energy into the heating layer does not affect @xmath86_. the efficiency of converting the input heat into the surface radiation ( @xmath89 ) is generally small .",
    "the highest efficiency is achieved if we heat the outer crust ( the layer i ) with low intensity .    in the right panel of figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we present @xmath86 and @xmath29 as a function of the maximum density @xmath28 of the heating layer , for one heat intensity @xmath90  and three fixed minimum densities of this layer ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 ) .",
    "one can observe the saturation of @xmath86 with increasing @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath28 is large and the heating layer is extended into the core , the heat energy is huge .",
    "however , as long as @xmath27 is far from the surface , this huge energy is almost fully carried away by neutrinos and does not heat the surface . in this case",
    "the efficiency of heat conversion into the surface emission is very low .    in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we compare qualitatively the calculated values of @xmath86 with the thermal surface luminosities from the `` magnetar box '' ( the lower shaded strip , estimated using accepted values of @xmath48 and the 1.4@xmath53 neutron star model ) . the heating should be sufficiently intense to raise @xmath86 to these magnetar values .",
    "it is the first requirement to explain the observations of the magnetars .",
    "the second requirement stems from the energy budget of an isolated neutron star .",
    "the heat energy is assumed to be taken from some source which pumps the energy @xmath29 into the heating layer during magnetar s life ( @xmath94 years in eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) ) . naturally , the total available energy @xmath95 is restricted .",
    "at least it should be much smaller than @xmath96  erg , the gravitational energy of the neutron star .",
    "we assume that the maximum energy of the internal heating is @xmath97 erg ( which is the magnetic energy of the star with the magnetic field @xmath98  g in the core ) .",
    "then the maximum energy generation rate is @xmath99 erg  s@xmath71 , which is plotted by the upper horizontal solid line in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the upper shaded space above this line is thus prohibited by the energy budget .",
    "a successful interpretation of magnetars as cooling neutron stars requires @xmath86 to be sufficiently high to reach the `` magnetar box '' and @xmath29 to be sufficiently low to avoid the prohibited region .",
    "these conditions are fulfilled for the heating layer located in the outer stellar crust and the heat intensities @xmath19 between @xmath100 and @xmath101  ( higher value preferred ) .",
    "a typical efficiency of heat conversion into the surface emission under these conditions is @xmath102 .",
    "we have performed a number of additional tests . in particular , we have studied sensitivity of our results to the values of the neutrino emissivity in the neutron star core and crust . we find that variations of the neutrino emissivity in the inner crust and the core of the star that undergoes intense heating can strongly affect the temperature profiles in the stellar interior but have almost no effect on the surface temperature .",
    "this is another example of the thermal decoupling of the outer crust and deep interiors . on the other hand",
    ", we find that @xmath86 is sensitive to the neutrino emission in the outer crust .",
    "this emission in a hot crust is mainly generated by plasmon decay and electron - nucleus bremsstrahlung mechanisms ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if magnetars have very strong magnetic fields in their outer crusts , these fields can greatly modify the plasmon decay neutrino process .",
    "such modifications have not been studied in detail but can be important for the magnetar physics .    we have made some test runs taking into account the effects of superfluidity . in particular , we have included superfluidity of free neutrons in the inner crust and the associated neutrino emission via cooper pairing of neutrons .",
    "this neutrino emission affects the temperature profiles in the inner crust but has almost no effect on the surface temperature .",
    "we have also varied the maximum density @xmath6 of the heat blanketing layer , shifting it from the present position @xmath11  ( section [ physics ] ) to @xmath14 , as in our previous model @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have varied the magnetic field strength @xmath47 in the blanketing envelope from @xmath103  g to @xmath104  g. the cooling curves and the internal temperature profiles are sensitive to these variations but do not violate our principal conclusions .",
    "it would be desirable to reconsider the cooling with a more careful treatment of heat transport and neutrino emission in a magnetized outer crust .",
    "the development of a specific theoretical model of the internal heating is outside the scope of this paper ( existing models are summarized , e.g. , in review papers by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , our results place stringent constraints on the possible models .",
    "the main requirement is that the total heat energy should be huge , @xmath105 erg , and should be released during @xmath106 years in the outer neutron star crust .",
    "this does not necessarily require that the energy be stored in the outer crust but that it be effectively transformed into heat there .",
    "our results agree with the widespread point of view that the magnetars can be powered neither by their rotation , nor by accretion , nor by thermal energy in a cooling star , nor by the strain energy accumulated in the crust .",
    "all these energy sources contain much less than @xmath107 erg .",
    "nevertheless , the required energy can be accumulated in the magnetic field if , for example , the star possesses the field @xmath108  g in its core .",
    "the evolution of this magnetic field can be accompanied by a strong energy release in the outer crust , where the electric conductivity is especially low and the field undergoes the strongest ohmic dissipation .",
    "an actual structure of the magnetic field in the star can be complicated . in particular",
    ", the magnetic configuration in the crust can strongly deviate from a magnetic dipole .",
    "one can not exclude that thermal radiation of magnetars is emitted from a smaller part of the neutron star surface ( e.g. , from hot spots near magnetic poles ) , implying lower total heat energies .",
    "nevertheless , observable thermal x - ray luminosities of magnetars @xmath109 erg  s@xmath71 ( e.g. , @xcite ) are consistent with the interval of thermal luminosities in figure [ fig5 ] calculated assuming the emission from the entire surface .",
    "radiation from the sources included in our `` magnetar box '' usually demonstrates low pulsed fraction ( @xmath49 ) which also indicates that this radiation can be emitted from the entire surface ( although the pulsed fraction can be lowered by the gravitational lensing effect ) .",
    "let us recall also alternative theories of magnetars .",
    "they suggest that the main energy release occurs in the magnetar s magnetosphere ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the radiation spectrum is formed there as a result of comptonization and reprocession of the quasi - thermal spectrum .",
    "we have modeled thermal states and thermal evolution of magnetars ( sgrs and axps ) with the aim to explain high surface temperatures of these neutron stars and their energy budget .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) it is impossible to explain high thermal states of magnetars as cooling neutron stars without assuming that they undergo powerful heating .",
    "we have developed the idea that the heat source operates in the interior of magnetars .",
    "\\(2 ) the heat source can be located in a thin layer at densities @xmath0  in the outer magnetar crust , with the heat intensity ranged from @xmath110 to @xmath73 .",
    "the source can not be located deeper in the interior because the heat energy would be radiated away by neutrinos ; it would be unable to warm up the surface .",
    "this deeper heating is extremely inefficient and inconsistent with the energy budget of neutron stars .",
    "pumping huge heat energy into the deeper layers would not increase the surface temperature .",
    "\\(3 ) heating of the outer crust produces a strongly nonuniform temperature distribution within the star .",
    "the temperature in the heating layer exceeds @xmath111  k , while the bottom of the crust and the stellar core remain much colder .",
    "the thermal state of the heat layer and of the surface is almost independent of physical parameters of deeper layers ( such as the equation of state , neutrino emission , heat transport , superfluidity of baryons ) , which means thermal decoupling of the outer crust from the inner layers .",
    "the total energy released in the heat layer during magnetar s life ( @xmath112 years ) can not be lower than @xmath113 erg ; maximum 1% of this energy can be spent to heat the surface .",
    "the present calculations can be improved by a more careful treatment of heat conduction in a magnetized plasma of the outer crust , at @xmath114 , as well as by considering different magnetic fields and the presence of light ( accreted ) elements in the surface layers of magnetars .",
    "we intend to study these effects in our next publication .",
    "the nature and the physical model of internal heating are still not clear ; they should be elaborated in the future . in any case",
    ", one should bear in mind that the heat energy released within the magnetars should be at least two orders of magnitude higher than the photon thermal energy emitted through their surface , and the energy release should take place in the outer stellar crust .",
    "these model - independent conclusions are consequences of the well - known principle that any hot , dense matter in stellar objects is a strong source of neutrino emission .",

    "<S> we study thermal structure and evolution of magnetars as cooling neutron stars with a phenomenological heat source in a spherical internal layer . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the location of this layer as well as the heating rate that could explain high observable thermal luminosities of magnetars and would be consistent with the energy budget of neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the heat source should be located in an outer magnetar s crust , at densities @xmath0  g  @xmath1 , and should have the heat intensity of @xmath2 . </S>",
