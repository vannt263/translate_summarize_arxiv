    "the bright - end cutoff of the [ o  iii ] @xmath0 planetary nebula luminosity function ( pnlf ) is one of the most important standard candles on the extragalactic distance ladder .",
    "the technique is well - tested , extremely accurate ( @xmath4 ) , and applicable throughout the local supercluster @xcite .",
    "in fact , since the pnlf technique is equally effective for both spiral and elliptical galaxies , its distances provide a crucial link between the population  i and population  ii distance scales .",
    "unfortunately , the pnlf method has one significant failing . despite several attempts at modeling the function",
    ", there is still no robust theory for the physics of the phenomenon .",
    "indeed , the simple argument of @xcite and the detailed simulations of @xcite and @xcite agree that , once the age of a stellar population exceeds @xmath5  gyr , the pnlf cutoff should fade dramatically with age .",
    "this prediction is in direct conflict with the numerous internal and external tests that have been applied to the method @xcite .",
    "the studies of @xcite and @xcite , along with those of others @xcite have focussed exclusively on understanding how the absolute magnitude of the pnlf cutoff varies with population age and metallicity .",
    "what these studies have not considered is how the production rate of [ o  iii]-bright planetaries evolves with time .",
    "this is an important omission , since the number of pns populating the top part of the luminosity function provides an important constraint on the progenitors of these extremely luminous objects .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the possible progenitors of pns in the top half magnitude of the [ o  iii ] @xmath0 planetary nebula luminosity function . in  2 , we review the three observational constraints which any successful model must satisfy : the invariance of the pnlf cutoff to population age and metallicity , the absolute brightness of the cutoff , and the fraction of a galaxy s stars which evolve through this extremely luminous stage . in  3 , we use these constraints to identify the likely progenitors of [ o  iii]-bright pns .",
    "we suggest that , although single stars with initial masses of @xmath6 can provide many or most of a galaxy s brightest planetaries , a non - negligible fraction of the pns in the top @xmath7  mag of the luminosity function come from coalesced binary stars .",
    "in particular , we identify blue stragglers as the likely progenitors of [ o  iii]-bright planetaries , and show that production rate of these objects is close to that needed to explain the pn counts in elliptical galaxies .",
    "we conclude by discussing the implications this hypothesis has for the pnlf of spiral galaxies , and how binary star evolution may affect efforts to use planetaries to probe galactic evolution .",
    "pnlf measurements have now been made in @xmath8  galaxies , ranging from normal ellipticals and lenticulars , such as ngc  3379 , m86 , and m87 , to late - type spirals and irregulars , such as m33 , m101 , and the large magellanic cloud . in each system , the [ o  iii ] @xmath0 pn luminosity function has a distinctive bright - end cutoff , which can be modeled with the truncated exponential @xmath9 in the above equation , @xmath10 , the absolute magnitude of a planetary , is related to monochromatic [ o  iii ] @xmath0 flux ( in ergs  @xmath11  s@xmath12 ) by @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the absolute magnitude of the most luminous planetary @xcite .",
    "any model which seeks to explain this function must not only reproduce this shape , but also satisfy three additional criteria .",
    "the fact that the pnlf cutoff does not depend on metallicity is not a surprise . from the beginning",
    ", it was realized that oxygen acts as a thermostat in the nebula , and the ( weak ) abundance dependence that remains is almost exactly canceled by opacity effects inside the progenitor star @xcite . thus ,",
    "unless the system is extremely metal - poor ,  [ o / h ] @xmath15 , the metallicity dependence of @xmath14 should be negligible @xcite . what was not obvious was why the absolute magnitude of the cutoff does not depend on age .",
    "the energy which powers an [ o  iii]-bright pn comes from its central star , and the luminosity emitted by this central star is a sensitive function of its mass ( @xmath16 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the mass of a post - agb core depends on the progenitor s main - sequence mass through the initial mass - final mass relation @xcite , it is natural to conclude that the absolute magnitude of the pnlf cutoff will fade with time . yet",
    "as numerous observations have shown , this dimming does not occur @xcite .",
    "there are a number of processes which can limit the [ o  iii ] flux of population  i planetaries .",
    "the rapid evolutionary times associated with high mass central stars may not allow the nebulae to reach the low densities needed for efficient forbidden line cooling @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the short time between the onset of the fast wind and ionization may limit the amount of o@xmath17 available for collisional excitation @xcite .",
    "finally , as pointed out by @xcite , the [ o  iii ] emission around high mass central stars may be self - extincted by the objects dense , dusty envelopes @xcite .",
    "nowhere is this last mechanism more evident than in the large magellanic cloud , where , without circumstellar extinction , half of the 16 brightest pns analyzed by @xcite would appear brighter than @xmath14 .",
    "( in fact , one heavily extincted lmc planetary , smp  89 , has an intrinsic [ o  iii ] @xmath0 flux that exceeds @xmath14 by over 0.7  mag ! )    the above processes all serve to place an upper limit on the [ o  iii ] flux emitted by a galaxy s brightest planetary nebulae .",
    "unfortunately , there is no equivalent set of conditions which places a lower limit on this quantity .",
    "this leads to a second constraint .",
    "observations of planetary nebulae in galaxies with well - determined cepheid distances yield a value for the pnlf cutoff magnitude of @xmath18 @xcite . in other words ,",
    "planetary nebulae at the bright end of the [ o  iii ] luminosity function emit more than @xmath19 of power at 5007   .",
    "note , however , that this is only a small fraction of the object s total energy : both models and observations indicate that no more than 10% of a central star s total luminosity comes out in this line @xcite .",
    "consequently , the post - agb stars which power a galaxy s brightest planetaries must , at a minimum , have luminosities in excess of @xmath20 . indeed , in the bulge of m31",
    ", 3 out of the 12 planetaries analyzed by @xcite have central star luminosities brighter than @xmath21 .",
    "such high luminosities are a major problem for pnlf models . in order to generate @xmath20 of power",
    ", a pn central star must have a mass of at least @xmath22 @xcite . moreover , as table  [ tab1 ] suggests , the actual lower mass limit is probably larger . in the table , we have listed those smc , lmc , and m31 pns with absolute [ o  iii ] @xmath0 magnitudes within 0.5  mag of @xmath14 , and with central stars whose properties have been derived via a spectrophotometric analysis . except for the smc pns , whose core luminosities , masses , and @xmath14",
    "are suppressed by low metallicity @xcite , the local group s [ o  iii]-bright planetaries all have cores greater than @xmath23 .",
    "this mass is significantly larger than the @xmath24 value which is typical for white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the initial mass - final mass relation for solar metallicity stars predicts that the progenitors of @xmath25 cores should have main - sequence masses close to @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "such high mass objects are not normally associated with early - type galaxies , and in m32 , which is considered to be a `` young '' elliptical @xcite , they are definitely not present @xcite .",
    "this situation is even worse when one considers the effect of metallicity : if the models of @xcite and @xcite are correct , then the main sequence masses of [ o  iii]-bright pns in the metal - rich environments of giant ellipticals need to be even greater .",
    "the third constraint on the pnlf comes from the number of pns which populate the bright - end of the luminosity function . if we let @xmath27 be the observed number of planetary nebulae per unit ( bolometric ) luminosity of the underlying parent stellar population , then @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the population s luminosity specific stellar evolutionary flux , @xmath30 , the mean time that pns spend in the [ o  iii]-bright stage , and @xmath31 , the fraction of stars turning off the main sequence that evolve into [ o  iii]-bright planetaries . for old stellar populations , such as those found in elliptical and lenticular galaxies , @xmath32  stars  yr@xmath33 , independent of age , metallicity , or the initial mass function @xcite .",
    "since the expected pn lifetime can be estimated from post - agb stellar evolutionary tracks @xcite and models of nebular evolution @xcite , measurements of @xmath27 can be used to place a strong constraint on the percentage of stars which contribute to the pnlf cutoff .",
    "estimates of @xmath27 currently exist for over 20 early - type galaxies . unfortunately ,",
    "most of these data are in terms of @xmath34 , the normalized number of planetaries within 2.5  mag of @xmath14 .",
    "not only does such a definition risk including fainter pns which never reached the bright end of the luminosity function , but it is also based on an extrapolation . because pn surveys outside the local group typically extend less than @xmath5  mag down the luminosity function , @xmath34 is usually derived by assuming that equation ( 1 ) is valid at all magnitudes",
    ". this may not be the case . while an exponential extrapolation appears adequate for some older populations , such as that found in the bulge of m31",
    ", star - forming systems have a pnlf that turns over @xmath35  mag below the cutoff @xcite . to avoid any assumption about the form of the luminosity function , we therefore restrict our analysis to those objects at the very top of the luminosity function .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] contains measurements of @xmath36 , the number of planetary nebulae observed within 0.5  mag of @xmath14 , normalized to the amount of bolometric luminosity surveyed .",
    "these numbers were derived from the studies listed in the table , using updated values for @xmath14 and galactic reddening @xcite , and the techniques described in the original papers .",
    "specifically , each value of @xmath36 was obtained by fitting the observed pnlf to the empirical function given in equation ( 1 ) , and then normalizing the predicted number of pns in the top half magnitude of the luminosity function to the total amount of bolometric luminosity sampled in the survey region .",
    "the errors quoted in table  [ tab2 ] represent only the formal uncertainties of the fitting procedure , and do not include errors in the luminosity normalizations .",
    "this additional term is likely to be small , @xmath2 .",
    "the greatest uncertainty in the normalizations probably comes from the bolometric corrections , which were computed from the galaxies spectral energy distributions , as defined by broadband optical and infrared colors . since these photometric measurements are not always homogeneous or complete , errors of up to @xmath37  mag are possible .",
    "fortunately in all cases , the derived bolometric corrections are within 0.1  mag of those predicted for old stellar systems by population synthesis models @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the behavior of @xmath36 as a function of several galactic parameters . for two of the variables , the globular cluster specific frequency @xcite and the [ mgfe ] composite absorption line index @xcite",
    ", @xmath36 shows no strong trend . however , the other four plots show correlations which are significant at greater than the 98% confidence level .",
    "galaxies with absolute magnitudes fainter than @xmath38 and colors bluer than @xmath39 have @xmath5  [ o  iii]-bright pn for every @xmath40 of bolometric light . in larger and redder galaxies , the luminosity specific number of pns declines as the galaxy s uv upturn , as measured by the _ iue _",
    "satellite @xcite , increases .",
    "this effect is dramatic , so that in the most extreme cases , @xmath36 is almost an order of magnitude smaller than in low - luminosity objects .",
    "the last panel of figure  [ fig1 ] shows the behavior of @xmath36 as a function of the strength of the galaxy s h@xmath41 absorption line .",
    "although the equivalent width of this feature depends on a number of factors , such as the system s metallicity and the @xmath27-element to iron ratio , the index is generally considered to be a good indicator of population age @xcite .",
    "thus , the direct correlation between @xmath36 and h@xmath41 strength suggests that younger populations are more efficient at producing [ o  iii]-bright planetaries than older , lower - turnoff mass systems .    to translate @xmath27 into stellar fractions , we need an estimate of the time that a typical pn remains in the top 0.5  mag of luminosity function",
    "this is not difficult to derive . if @xmath2 of a pn s energy comes out in [ o  iii ] @xmath0 , then the exciting star of an object in this stage of evolution must have @xmath42 and @xmath43  k. using these numbers , one can simply use stellar evolutionary tracks to estimate how long a particular central star satisfies these conditions .",
    "alternatively , one can take the approach of @xcite and place evolving post - agb stars within dynamically evolving nebular models , and track the evolution of all the pn s emission lines as a function of time .",
    "such an analysis shows that , although the precise timescale for [ o  iii ] evolution depends on a number of parameters , such as central star mass , post - agb transition time , and the composition of the energy producing shell , a value of @xmath44  yr is appropriate for the brightest pns in a galaxy .",
    "the right hand axes of figure  [ fig1 ] translate @xmath27 to @xmath31 using the relationship given in equation ( 3 ) and a lifetime for [ o  iii]-bright pns of 500  yr . the absolute numbers are intriguing : despite the scatter , and the uncertainties inherent in our estimation of @xmath30 , it is clear that in early - type systems , only a small fraction of the stars ever reach the tip of the [ o  iii ] @xmath0 luminosity function . in small galaxies , and galaxies with recent star formation , @xmath45 of the stars which turn off the main sequence eventually evolve into planetaries which populate the bright end of the pnlf . in redder systems , this fraction drops to only @xmath46 .",
    "these small values provide an important clue for understanding the planetary nebula luminosity function .",
    "to summarize the above section : the progenitors of the pns which populate the top 0.5  mag of the pnlf a ) have core masses of @xmath1 , b ) are present in all galaxies , and c ) are rarer in redder populations than in systems which may have undergone recent star formation . obviously , the greatest challenge to satisfying these conditions lies in reconciling the need for high mass central stars with the observed colors and spectral line indices of elliptical and lenticular galaxies .    in principle",
    ", there are two ways to generate high - core mass planetaries in early - type systems .",
    "the first is through the normal evolution of a trace population of stars with turnoff masses greater than @xmath47 .",
    "if , as figure  [ fig1 ] demonstrates , intermediate mass objects contribute between @xmath46 and @xmath45 of an elliptical galaxy s total luminosity , then all the constraints provided by the pn observations are satisfied .",
    "unfortunately , there is good reason to believe that this is not the case .",
    "turnoff masses of @xmath47 belong to populations with ages of @xmath5  gyr @xcite .",
    "components this young should be detectable via their effect on a galaxy s colors and spectral line indices , even if they comprise only @xmath46 of the system s total light @xcite . more importantly ,",
    "as figure  [ fig1 ] indicates , every early - type galaxy would have to have such a component .",
    "while it is possible that some objects ( such as ngc  1316 and 4382 ) have acquired an intermediate age population via a recent accretion or merger @xcite , this explanation can not work for all objects .",
    "galaxies , such as the `` standard '' elliptical ngc  3379 @xcite and the bulge of m31 display no evidence of interaction or star formation in the recent past @xcite .    a second",
    ", more plausible , explanation for the pnlf cutoff invokes an alternative form of stellar evolution . in the solar neighborhood , roughly two - thirds of the stars",
    "are binaries , and a large fraction of these systems interact at some time during their evolution @xcite .",
    "those interactions which occur on the giant or asymptotic giant branch [ the case  b and c scenarios of @xcite and @xcite ] usually result in a dynamic instability and the ejection of the giant star s envelope @xcite .",
    "however , if the primary is still in its core hydrogen burning phase when roche - lobe overflow occurs (  case a ) , then the mass transfer is likely to be conservative , and the result can be a star whose mass is greater than that appropriate for its age .",
    "indeed , there is ample evidence to suggest that this @xcite style mass transfer is at least partially responsible for the field population of blue straggler stars @xcite .    can case  a mass transfer alone explain the pnlf cutoff ? to answer this question , we begin by tentatively identifying blue stragglers as the possible progenitors of the [ o  iii]-bright planetaries of elliptical galaxies . such an identification is not unreasonable .",
    "most blue stragglers have masses that are less than twice that of their population s turnoff mass @xcite . for early - type systems with turnoffs of @xmath48 , this places the stars in the mass range needed to produce the high - mass cores associated with the pnlf cutoff .",
    "moreover , in the process of coalescence , blue stragglers should acquire a significant amount of angular momentum .",
    "this added rotational support has the potential to prolong the stars lives , and allow them to increase their core masses over and above that predicted by the single star initial mass - final mass relation .",
    "whether this actually happens is still an open question : although core growth is pronounced in stars with initial masses @xmath49 @xcite , the longer lifetimes of lower mass objects may enable the stars to shed much of their angular momentum while still close to the main sequence @xcite . yet , even if pn core masses are not enhanced by the merger process , binary evolution can still allow populations as old as @xmath50  gyr to make [ o  iii]-bright planetaries .",
    "the scenario therefore provides a natural explanation for the existence of @xmath14 planetaries in elliptical galaxies .",
    "if blue stragglers are the antecedents of pns near the top of the luminosity function , then the number of planetaries , relative to blue stragglers , should simply be the ratios of the objects lifetimes . as detailed in the preceding section , the lifetime of pns in the top 0.5  mag of the luminosity function is @xmath51  yr . to estimate the lifetime of blue stragglers , we can use the results of @xcite , who found that the product of an oblique merger between two @xmath52 stars spends roughly @xmath53  myr on the main sequence .",
    "since the progenitors of [ o  iii]-bright pns are likely to be slightly more massive than this , a value of @xmath51  myr seems reasonable for our analysis . based on this number",
    ", old stellar populations should have @xmath54 more blue stragglers than [ o  iii]-bright planetary nebulae .    to test this prediction",
    ", we first examine the stellar content of galactic globular clusters .",
    "this is a difficult place to investigate blue straggler densities , since collisions offer a separate channel for the objects creation and destruction @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the environment can serve as a benchmark , since reasonably complete blue straggler surveys now exist for 56 galactic globulars @xcite .",
    "the analysis of this database demonstrates that , very roughly , globular clusters possess @xmath55  blue stragglers per unit solar @xmath56-band luminosity . since the bolometric correction for old , metal poor systems is small ( @xmath57 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this number is directly comparable to @xmath36 , the bolometric luminosity specific density of planetaries .",
    "the ratio of the two specific frequencies , @xmath54 , is amazingly close to that inferred from the objects lifetimes .",
    "this agreement presents strong circumstantial evidence that the two evolutionary states are connected .    as noted above",
    ", globular clusters are not the ideal location for studying binary - evolved blue stragglers . in order to investigate the systematics of these objects ,",
    "one really needs to survey an environment where stellar collisions are negligible . at present , data exist for only two such locations : the ursa minor dwarf galaxy @xcite and the milky way s own halo @xcite .",
    "although neither dataset is normalized to population luminosity , we can use the ratio of blue stragglers to horizontal branch stars as a proxy . in the ursa minor dwarf galaxy ,",
    "this ratio is @xmath58 ; in the milky way s halo , the value is close to @xmath59 . for comparison , in the globular clusters studied by @xcite , there are @xmath60 blue stragglers for every horizontal branch star . whether the lower number for globulars is related to the systems history of blue straggler formation @xcite or some other mechanism is not known at this time .",
    "however , the data do confirm that the production rate of blue stragglers in old stellar populations is close to that needed to explain the pns in the top half magnitude of the pnlf .",
    "if the above scenario is correct , then there are two separate mechanisms for populating the top 0.5  mag of the pn luminosity function : the direct channel , via the evolution of single stars with initial masses of @xmath6 , and the binary evolution route , where case  a accretion and coalescence creates blue stragglers at or near this mass .",
    "obviously , in elliptical galaxies , the latter channel will dominate .",
    "the production rate of binary - evolved pns should fall with time , as fewer and fewer blue stragglers attain the mass necessary to produce a @xmath22  core .",
    "( there is evidence for this in figure  [ fig1 ] , as the large , red galaxies with weak h@xmath41 indices have systematically fewer pns than their bluer counterparts . ) however , based on the evidence from h@xmath41 and other absorption line spectral indices @xcite , the single - star evolutionary route contributes almost nothing to the pnlf cutoff in population  ii systems .",
    "the situation is less clear in galaxies with recent star formation . although the single - star channel for pn production is efficient , only those stars which formed between 0.1 and 1  gyr ago (  the evolutionary times for stars in the @xmath35 to @xmath61 range ) can contribute to the top @xmath7  mag of the pnlf .",
    "conversely , though only a small fraction of binaries will evolve into [ o  iii]-bright pns , this channel is open to objects as old as @xmath50  gyr ( or older , if blue straggler cores are enhanced by rotational support ) .",
    "thus , it is conceivable that the latter mechanism is important even in late - type systems .",
    "we can explore this possibility by making a simple model of galaxy evolution that includes both single stars and close binary systems .",
    "we begin with the premise that the timescale for the creation of a blue straggler is , in some way , tied to the evolutionary timescale of the system s primary star .",
    "this assumption is problematic : the processes which govern a stellar coalescence may instead be controlled by the rate at which a magnetized stellar wind carries away angular momentum @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for the purpose of this exploratory calculation , the hypothesis should be acceptable .",
    "next , we adopt a model of binary formation in which primaries ( and single stars ) obey a @xcite initial mass function , secondaries are drawn from the distribution of mass ratios given by @xcite , and the initial log period distribution of binaries ( in days ) is flat between 0 and 6 @xcite .",
    "we then divide our binary stars into three classes : short period ( @xmath62  days ) binaries , which undergo conservative mass transfer and coalescence , intermediate period ( @xmath63 ) systems , which interact on the giant branch and do not form high - mass cores , and long period ( @xmath64  days ) wide binaries , which evolve as single stars .",
    "finally , we assume that initially , binary systems outnumber single stars by a ratio of two to one @xcite and that the initial mass - final mass relation of @xcite and @xcite applies to both single stars and coalesced binaries . using these assumptions",
    ", we can compute the mass spectrum of pn central stars as a function of a system s star formation rate history , and determine the fraction of [ o  iii]-bright planetaries that evolve from close binaries .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] displays the results of our model for the case of a galaxy which has been forming stars at a constant rate for 13  gyr .",
    "the figure demonstrates that blue - straggler evolution is important : almost 20% of pns with core masses @xmath65 are evolved from this alternative form of evolution .",
    "furthermore , by using the same initial mass - final mass relation for single stars and coalesced binaries , the model is ignoring the effects of angular momentum .",
    "if blue straggler cores are enhanced by as little as 10% by the rotational support acquired in the merger process , then populations as old as @xmath66  gyr will be able produce [ o  iii]-bright pns , and almost 40% of the brightest planetaries in a star - forming galaxy will have binary stars as their progenitors .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] expands on this point by showing how the importance of binary evolution changes as a function of a galaxy s history of star formation . in the figure",
    ", we have assumed that the galaxy s star - formation rate has declined exponentially with time ; the abscissa of the figure plots this timescale , @xmath67 .",
    "( for reference , the e0 , sb , sbc , and sc galaxies of @xcite have timescales of @xmath68 , and 7  gyr , respectively . )",
    "the ordinate of the plot shows the fraction of pns with core masses greater than @xmath69 that are evolved from coalesced binaries .",
    "the figure confirms that binary - evolved objects are important for defining the top end of the pnlf , even in galaxies with intermediate age populations such as the magellanic clouds @xcite . in earlier - type systems with little recent star - formation ,",
    "virtually all of the [ o  iii]-bright pns come from coalesced binaries .",
    "if the above scenario is correct , then it presents a major problem for the study of pns within our own galaxy . according to figure  [ fig3 ] ,",
    "the milky way contains two types of high - core mass planetaries , one descended from intermediate - mass single stars of the recent past , and one evolved from the lower - mass close binaries formed throughout history .",
    "the two objects may not be easily distinguishable .",
    "if the dynamical coupling between a progenitor s core and envelope is weak @xcite , then it may be possible to identify blue - straggler evolved objects via the rapid rotation of their pns central stars .",
    "unfortunately , though there is good reason to believe that stars retain some of their angular momenta through the first ascent of the giant branch @xcite , this rotation may not be able to survive the mass loss on the agb . on the other hand , if a blue straggler core sheds its angular momentum via an agb superwind , the result could be a bipolar nebulae . this does not seem to be the case , since bipolar planetaries in the milky way appear to have a smaller galactic scale height ( and therefore a younger progenitor age ) than their elliptical and circular counterparts @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , incompletenesses in the pn sample @xcite , as well as our general inability to determine the absolute magnitudes of galactic pns @xcite leave some room for doubt .",
    "the blue straggler hypothesis has several implications for pn identifications in distant galaxies .",
    "the first concerns the `` dip '' in the luminosity function that occurs in star - forming systems . @xcite have argued that a pnlf formed entirely from high mass planetaries must have a deficit of objects between @xmath35 and @xmath59  mag below @xmath14 , due to the rapid fading of central stars whose nuclear reactions have recently stopped .",
    "indeed , the pnlfs of the smc and m33 show just this effect : in these star - forming galaxies , the number of intermediate brightness planetaries drops significantly @xcite .",
    "no such deficit is present in the old stellar population of m31 s bulge @xcite . in this system , it is likely that most of the pns do not participate in the pnlf cutoff , and join the luminosity function at fainter magnitudes .",
    "these lower mass objects fill in the deficit produced by the high core - mass , binary - evolved pns , and cause the pnlf to appear strictly monotonic .",
    "another implication of our blue straggler theory involves the stellar populations of elliptical galaxies . under our conservative mass transfer binary coalescence model ,",
    "the pnlf of early - type systems is defined by binaries whose combined mass on the main sequence is greater @xmath47 . as a population ages , fewer and fewer binaries will satisfy this condition ; consequently the number of such systems , as reflected by the @xmath36 , should decrease with time .",
    "the parameter therefore has the potential to probe a population s turnoff mass , even when that turnoff is too faint for direct observation .",
    "moreover , unlike the results of integrated light spectroscopy , the information provided by @xmath36 will not be luminosity weighted .",
    "it may therefore be an effective complement to the traditional approach of studying elliptical galaxy populations via absorption - line indices .",
    "of course , if a population is old enough , no binary system will have enough mass to evolve into an @xmath14 planetary , and the pnlf will cease to be a reliable distance indicator .",
    "fortunately , judging from the pnlf measurements to date @xcite , and the presence of a high core - mass planetary in the galactic globular cluster m15 @xcite , this time has not yet occurred .",
    "finally , the contribution of binary - evolved pns to the pnlf has important implications for the use of planetary nebulae as tracers of a system s star - formation history and chemical evolution .",
    "for example , by analyzing the line ratios and line fluxes of a set of pns at a known distance , @xcite has shown that it is not only possible to measure the objects chemistry , but also the masses of the pns central stars .",
    "consequently , with the aid of an initial - mass final - mass relation @xcite , it is theoretically possible to use planetaries to trace a galaxy s star formation and chemical enrichment history back @xmath70  yr .",
    "unfortunately , the method only works if there is a unique relation between the mass of a pn s core and the main - sequence mass of its progenitor star .",
    "our observations suggest that this is not the case , at least for the brightest pns in a galaxy . because a substantial fraction of these objects evolve from binary stars , the use of bright planetaries for chemical evolution studies is problematic .",
    "the situation should improve as one observes further down the luminosity function . by their very nature ,",
    "blue stragglers tend to produce pns with high - mass central stars .",
    "their existence will therefore complicate pn - based efforts to probe a galaxy s recent ( @xmath35  gyr ) star formation history @xcite .",
    "however , the inverse relationship between main - sequence mass and stellar lifetime , coupled with the initial mass - final mass relation , guarantees that single stars will be the dominant source of lower mass cores .",
