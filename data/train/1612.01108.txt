    "the transport of micron - sized inertial particles in turbulent wall - bounded flows has a wide range of industrial , environmental and biological applications .",
    "droplets suspended in turbulent flow in an engine combustion chamber or pollen particles transported by the atmospheric boundary layer are some typical examples .",
    "these particle - laden flows are mainly characterised by two specific phenomena : _ preferential accumulation _ or small - scale clustering and _ turbophoresis_. in the latter , heavy particles accumulate near the wall due to the gradients in the turbulent kinetic energy profile,@xcite while in the former , heavier - than - fluid particles aggregate in regions characterised by higher values of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate and zero acceleration .",
    "turbophoresis occurs in wall - dominated turbulence ; however , preferential accumulation appears in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous particle - laden turbulent flows ( see for instance @xcite or @xcite for a review ) .    in the context of wall - bounded flows ,",
    "particle dispersion has been mainly studied in canonical flows ( channels , pipes and boundary layers ) despite the fact that internal flows relevant to industrial applications often contain parts with geometrical complexities which promotes complex flow phenomena such as secondary flows , separation , _",
    "etc_. it is therefore fundamental to investigate the particulate phase behaviour in more complex non - canonical geometries where a slight modification of the characteristics of the flow can induce a significant change in the vortical structures and consequently in particle clustering and near - wall turbophoresis . among the principal mechanisms driving secondary motions the _ lateral curvature _ of the main flow and the _ gradients of the reynolds stresses _ are the most common .",
    "the former is generally found in arched geometries where the imbalance between the cross - stream pressure gradient and centrifugal forces causes a secondary motion . this skew - induced cross - flow motion ( due to an inviscid process )",
    "is usually referred to as prandtl s secondary motion of first kind . in the latter mechanism",
    "mean streamwise vortices are formed as a result of the local variation of reynolds stresses .",
    "these are known as prandtl s secondary motion of second kind ( or stress - induced vortices ) and are observed in , for instance , turbulent flows through straight ducts with noncircular cross - section .",

    "* ) the effect of the geometry - induced centrifugal forces on particle dynamics was recently addressed by noorani et al.,@xcite who performed direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of particle - laden turbulent flow in straight , mildly curved and strongly bent pipes .",
    "the focus of the present paper is therefore on the effect of turbulence - driven secondary motion on particle dynamics in turbulent duct flows with different width - to - height aspect ratios .",
    "the in - plane flow in turbulent ducts consists of four pairs of counter - rotating vortices ( one on each quadrant of the duct ) .",
    "the magnitude of this cross - flow motion only amounts to around @xmath2 of the bulk velocity @xmath3 , and its effect on particle transport is usually ignored in practical applications .",
    "the objective of the current study is to carefully quantify the impact of such small in - plane flow on the transport and dynamics of micron - sized heavy inertial solid spherical particles , which turns out to be significant .",
    "the turbulent carrier phase through a square duct has been analysed in a number of numerical and experimental studies , which are reviewed in @xcite limited number of studies also analysed the dispersion and deposition of heavy inertial particles in a turbulent square duct .",
    "@xcite studied the preferential concentration of inertial point particles in a downward square duct using large - eddy simulation ( les ) of the fluid flow at @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is defined in terms of the duct half - height @xmath6 and the mean friction velocity @xmath7 ) .",
    "they assessed the usefulness of different vortex identification methods for analysing preferential accumulation of particles in four locations within the square duct cross - section .",
    "these authors also used the same geometry to study the wall - deposition of particles in various locations of the duct.@xcite they reported that deposition is least likely in the duct corner and most likely in the duct centre .",
    "the role of the secondary flows in the mixing and dispersion of one - way coupled inertial point particles in a turbulent square duct flow at @xmath4 was investigated by @xcite and phares and sharma.@xcite analysing statistics of single - particle and particle - pair dispersion , it was found that lateral mixing is increased for low - inertia particles due to the outward advective transport absent in the canonical straight pipe and channels flows .",
    "heavy inertial particles accumulate close to the wall , and tend to mix more efficiently in the streamwise direction due to the fact that a large number of the particles spend more time in a region where the mean fluid velocity is smaller than the bulk flow .",
    "@xcite studied particle re - suspension in a turbulent square duct flow by means of les and lagrangian particle tracking ( lpt ) of one - way coupled inertial particles .",
    "they reported that turbulence - driven secondary flows within the duct play an important role in the re - suspension process of particles .",
    "these authors also analysed the particle deposition under the same condition and their result confirmed the previous findings of @xcite and sharma and phares.@xcite recently @xcite investigated the effect of collisions on the particle deposition in turbulent square duct flows .",
    "this group suggested that the inter - particle collisions increase the particle diffusion in the wall - normal direction , which makes the particles distribution more uniform close to the wall .    the flow through a rectangular duct of aspect ratio @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the total duct width and @xmath10 is the duct full height ) adds an additional degree of complexity to the physics of wall - bounded turbulence , since the corner bisector symmetry is lost , which significantly influences the secondary flow pattern .",
    "it is known from studies on the carrier phase that the flow characteristics near the duct centerplane approach those of canonical spanwise - periodic turbulent channels when the aspect ratio increases .",
    "the response of the particulate phase dynamics to such changes in the aspect ratio of the duct has not been explored yet .",
    "the aim of this study is then to evaluate the eulerian statistics of dispersed inertial micro - particles in square and non - square ducts and analyse the changes in solid phase dynamics when the duct becomes wider and approaches a canonical channel flow in the centerplane . to the authors knowledge",
    "there are no studies in the literature regarding inertial point particles in non - square duct geometries , which makes the present study a first work to characterise the particle behaviour .",

    "[ fig : fig12 ] and the profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig13 ] .",
    "it is readily seen that for lighter particles in the square duct and along the side wall of the rectangular geometry there is only one peak adjacent to the wall located on the plane of symmetry .",
    "this peak , however , disappears and the tke is significantly reduced in the wall bisector with increasing particle inertia . in turn , two other peaks appear close to the corners in both cases .",
    "this process is different near the horizontal walls of the rectangular duct .",
    "the near - wall peak of tke decreases half - way through the corner with increasing particle inertia .",
    "this generates two peaks close to the corner ( @xmath122 ) while the one on the horizontal wall bisector endures .",
    "the weak but resilient secondary motion in ducts can lead to the particle behaviour sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig15 ] .",
    "the streamlines adjacent to the corner bisectors may directly transport inertial particles towards the corners .",
    "however , the off - corner - bisector wall - ward streamlines push the particulate phase with large stokes number ( and thus long enough _ memory _ ) from a highly fluctuating region towards the quiescent region at the wall .",
    "inertia prevents the particles to follow these curved streamlines and the particulate phase is inevitably centrifuged towards the wall viscous sublayer ( grey arrow in [ fig : fig15 ] _ b _ ) .",
    "the effect is larger for heavier particles as the peak appears closer to the corner for heavier populations ( _ c.f . _",
    "[ fig : fig13 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "farther away from the corners , the less fluctuating particles engaged in a diffusive process deep in the viscous sublayer of the duct are extracted and directed towards the duct centre by the action of these outward ( vertical ) streamlines which in turn reduces the fluctuation value in the buffer layer ( black arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig15 ] _ b _ ) .",
    "this explains the maximum - minimum pattern in the velocity fluctuations away from the corners . in the rectangular duct ( larger @xmath0 ) , however , the effect of the secondary cells near the horizontal wall bisector ( vertical symmetry plane ) of the duct is progressively attenuated and the state of the flow approaches to that of a spanwise - periodic channel . as a result ,",
    "the tke and velocity fluctuations in the buffer layer near the vertical symmetry plane increase again in the @xmath57 duct , and consequently the peak of tke is recovered in this region .",
    "( -280,100)@xmath63    ( -280,150)@xmath64          in order to further investigate transport phenomena in turbulent ducts , the particle mean streamwise flux @xmath123 is computed and compared to that in a circular duct ( straight pipe ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig15c ] . although the reynolds numbers of the two cases are slightly different , provided that the mass flux and characteristics of particles are the same , the values are comparable . the particle flux @xmath124 is defined as particle number density per unit volume multiplied by the corresponding velocities and normalised with the tracer flux in the straight pipe of @xcite it can be seen the @xmath123 of tracers in a square and in a rectangular duct are smaller than that in pipe purely due to the larger cross - sectional area of the former . for inertial particles when increasing the particle relaxation time , the axial particle flux first decreases drastically and then slowly recovers , independent of the geometry .",
    "this behaviour is similar to what is observed in bent pipes and is related to the efficiency of a population to remain a longer period in the viscous sublayer of the wall - bounded flow .",
    "more importantly , for * stp10 * particles and larger , the particle flux in the streamwise direction of the rectangular duct and pipe is almost identical while the flux in the square duct is larger .",

    "these directly affected the particle velocity fluctuations such that multiple peaks near the duct walls appear for the particle streamwise and wall - normal velocity fluctuations .",
