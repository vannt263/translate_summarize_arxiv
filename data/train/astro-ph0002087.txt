    "the old globular cluster systems ( gcss ) in galaxy halos are of especial interest in a conference such as this , as they stand potentially to shed light on both local and global star formation in both protogalactic and present - day settings .",
    "because of their great age , their ubiquity in galaxies of most any hubble type , and their impressive spatial extent ( globulars can be found as far as 100 kpc away from the centers of large galaxies ) , the integrated properties of gcss clearly had to have been influenced by very general , large - scale star - formation processes in the early universe .",
    "but at the same time , most new stars today , whether in the galactic disk or in galaxy mergers and starbursts , are born not in isolation but in groups . to be sure ,",
    "the formation of a bona fide star cluster is a _ rare _ event ( only a very small fraction of young stellar groups emerge from their natal clumps of gas as gravitationally bound units ) but , as will be argued here , it is one that occurs _",
    "regularly_. thus , individual globular clusters must also be viewed  even if in a limit  as the products of a robust mode of smaller - scale star formation that has always been viable .",
    "it should come as no surprise , then , that there is no definitive theoretical description of the formation history of globular clusters ; while some concepts have been identified that do seem likely to survive as elements of a correct theory in the future , at this point there is simply no model that can claim completeness",
    ". detailed discussions of the many theories already in the literature may be found in , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the focus here will instead be on recent progress in extracting quantitative and ( as nearly as possible ) model - independent constraints from the data on many gcss . a similarly empirical discussion is given by @xcite , with an eye mostly to implications for large - scale aspects of galaxy formation and evolution ( see also @xcite ) . in what follows",
    ", particular emphasis will be placed on applications to the problem of _ generic _ star formation on subgalactic scales .",
    "a serious concern , when trying to use gcss in this way , is the influence of dynamical evolution on the gross properties of cluster systems that have been immersed for a hubble time in the tidal fields of their parent galaxies .",
    "two - body relaxation and evaporation , disk- and bulge - shock heating , chaotic scattering or disruption by a compact nucleus , and dynamical friction : all of these processes whittle away at clusters individually and collectively ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the case of the milky way",
    "particularly , the net effect is to define a roughly triangular region in mass  radius space , within which globulars are predicted to survive a 10-gyr dynamical onslaught ( @xcite)the implication being that any clusters born outside such a `` survival triangle '' would have disappeared , taking with them vital information on their birth properties .",
    "however , further investigation shows that milky way clusters located at large galactocentric radii ( @xmath3 kpc , roughly the effective radius of the bulge ) _ do not fill _ their expected survival triangles ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , evolutionary calculations geared to conditions in the giant elliptical m87 ( @xcite ) suggest that the damage done to an initial gcs may be largely confined to within an effective radius in that galaxy as well",
    ". thus , there are some features of globular clusters , and of gcss , that are _ not _ dictated purely by evolution from some completely obscured initial conditions , and while care must be taken in identifying such observables , the task is not an impossible one .    following the suggestion that large fractions of the gcss in ellipticals may have formed in major mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the related discovery of young , massive star clusters in systems like the antennae galaxies ( @xcite ) , much recent discussion in this field has centered on the interpretation of ( often ) bi- and multimodal distributions of globular cluster colors ( as indicators of integrated metallicity ) in relation to their host galaxies dynamical histories ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , as will be discussed further in  [ sec:3 ] , metallicity is completely decoupled from the other basic properties of individual globulars in the milky way ; thus , while gcs colors are of interest in the context of galaxy formation and chemical evolution , they seem to be of marginal importance to the star - formation process itself . in this connection , it is worth noting explicitly that literally thousands of genuinely old globulars have now been identified , in many galaxies besides our own , with colors as red as or redder than solar : _ high metallicity has never posed any apparent obstacle to the formation of massive star clusters_. this cautions against theories of globular formation such as those of @xcite and @xcite , which , at least in their current form , are able to account only for metal - poor objects .    of rather more direct relevance to the small - scale problem",
    "are the luminosity or mass functions of cluster systems .",
    "it is well known that the overall range of galactic globular cluster masses , @xmath4@xmath5 , and the mean value @xmath6 , are essentially universal properties of other gcss .",
    "traditionally , theories of globular cluster formation attempted to explain just this basic mass scale ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . more recently",
    ", however , attention has turned to the full _ mass spectrum _ , @xmath7 ( the number of clusters with mass @xmath8 in a single galaxy ) , which  in the regime usually observed , @xmath9is similar ( though not identical ) from galaxy to galaxy ; shows no detectable variations with radius in any one system ; and is remarkably similar to the mass function , @xmath10 or so , of the dense gas clumps currently forming stars in the giant molecular clouds of the milky way disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "these facts have suggested a general physical picture , developed by @xcite building on earlier arguments by @xcite and @xcite , in which handfuls of globulars form in each of many protogalactic fragments whose gas masses ( of order @xmath11 ) , sizes , and internal velocity dispersions correspond to disk gmcs scaled up by some three orders of magnitude in mass .",
    "such a picture has the obvious appeal of being at least conceptually consistent both with current models of hierarchical galaxy formation ( there is clearly some affinity with the classic picture of @xcite as well ) and with the observed pattern of present - day star formation .",
    "it also has more specific attractions ( e.g. , the protogalactic fragments and their protoglobulars are presumed to be supported largely by nonthermal mechanisms , thus allowing for metal - rich protoglobulars with the correct mass scale ) but many details remain to be worked out .",
    "see @xcite ( and compare the rather different view of @xcite ) for an attempt at a quantitative theory for gcs mass spectra which , with the @xcite framework as a backdrop , makes explicit use of the emerging links between present - day and protogalactic star formation .",
    "in addition to color and luminosity distributions , photometric studies of extragalactic gcss yield estimates of their specific frequencies ( total cluster populations , normalized to the parent galaxy luminosity ) and spatial structures ( number density of globulars as a function of galactocentric position ) .",
    "these are the focus of  [ sec:2 ] , where it is shown that a large sample of early - type galaxies display a common ratio of gcs mass to total mass in stars and ( hot ) gas  an apparently universal efficiency for the formation of globular clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally ,  [ sec:3 ] discusses the binding energies of globular clusters in the milky way ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is shown that a strong correlation between binding energy , total cluster luminosity , and galactocentric position is instrumental in defining a fundamental plane for galactic globulars  which , by incorporating every one of their many other structural correlations , systematically reduces these data to the smallest possible set of _ independent _ physical constraints for theories of cluster formation and evolution .",
    "the possibility that globular cluster systems can be connected not only to galaxy formation , but to ongoing star formation as well , is suggested by the fact that this latter process operates largely in a _ clustered mode_. one dramatic example of this is the situation in the orion b ( l1630 ) molecular cloud , where 96% of a complete sample of young stellar objects are physically associated with just four dense clumps of gas , each containing @xmath12 of material ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more generally , @xcite note that this is just a result of the different power - law slopes in the mass function of molecular clumps ( as above , @xmath10 , so that the largest clumps , which always weigh in at @xmath13@xmath14 , contain most of the star - forming gas mass in any molecular cloud ) and the stellar initial mass function ( @xmath15 , putting most of the mass in young stars into @xmath16 objects ) . in more extreme environments , the `` super '' star clusters  luminous , blue , compact associations with integrated properties roughly consistent with those expected of young globulars  found in many merging and starburst galaxies can account for as much as @xmath1720% of the uv light from such systems ( @xcite ) .    again",
    ", however , this is not to say that all , or even most , stars are born into true clusters that exist for any length of time as systems with negative energy .",
    "at some point during the collapse and fragmentation of a cluster - sized cloud of gas , the massive stars which it has formed will expel any remaining gas by the combined action of their stellar winds , photoionization , and supernova explosions .",
    "if the _ cumulative _ star formation efficiency ( sfe ) of the cloud , @xmath18 , is below a critical threshold when the gas is lost , then the blow - out removes sufficient energy that the stellar group left behind is unbound and disperses into the field . the precise value of this threshold depends on details of the dynamics and magnetic field in the gas cloud before its self - destruction , and on the timescale over which the massive stars dispel the gas ; but various estimates place it in the range @xmath190.5 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and see @xcite for a discussion of globulars specifically ) .",
    "a general theory of star formation must therefore be able to anticipate the final cumulative sfe in any single piece of gas with ( say ) a given mass and density , and thereby predict whether or not it will form a bound cluster .",
    "no such theory yet exists .",
    "it is possible , however , to empirically estimate the _ probability _ that a cluster - sized cloud of gas is able to achieve @xmath20 .",
    "this probability  or , equivalently , that fraction of an ensemble of massive star - forming clouds which manages to produce bound stellar systems  is referred to here as the efficiency of cluster formation . to get",
    "a handle on this for globulars in particular , @xcite works in terms of the _ mass _ fraction    @xmath21    where @xmath22 refers to the total gas supply that was available to form stars in a protogalaxy  whether in a monolithic collapse or a slower assembly of many distinct , subgalactic clumps is unimportant  and @xmath23 is the total mass of all globulars formed in that gas .",
    "the advantage of this definition for @xmath24 is that the total mass of a gcs is expected to be very well preserved over the course of dynamical evolution in a galaxy ; presently observed values are reasonable indicators of the initial quantities .",
    "this is ultimately due to the fact that gcs mass spectra are shallow enough that ( again , like the clumps in galactic molecular clouds ) most of any one system s mass is contained in its most massive clusters .",
    "but most of the destruction processes mentioned in  [ sec:1 ] operate most effectively against _",
    "low_-mass globulars , which may be lost in great numbers ( substantially affecting the total gcs population , @xmath25 ) while decreasing the integrated @xmath26 by as little as @xmath1725% ( @xcite ) .",
    "until very recently , it was generally assumed that a galaxy s total luminosity , or stellar mass , was an adequate stand - in for @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the number of globulars per unit of halo light has long been taken as a direct tracer of the efficiency of globular cluster formation in galaxies .",
    "however , this approach leads quickly to two interesting problems .",
    "specific frequency was originally defined by @xcite as a global property of galaxies .",
    "it is nominally the ratio , modulo a convenient normalization , of the total gcs population to the total @xmath27-band light integrated over an entire galaxy :    @xmath28    most subsequent studies of gcss have therefore estimated their total populations and cited @xmath29-values according to equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "it is more useful , however , following the discussion just above , to refer to total gcs and stellar masses ; thus ,    @xmath30    for a standard mean globular cluster mass @xmath31 and a representative stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath32 , appropriate to the _ cores _ of large ellipticals ( which value is used so as not to include any nonbaryonic dark matter in the galaxy mass ) . note that @xmath33 is not observed to deviate significantly from the milky way value , either from galaxy to galaxy or from place to place within any one system , but that @xmath32 _ does _ vary systematically , as a function of luminosity , among large ellipticals ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "global specific frequencies in a large sample of early - type galaxies are shown in fig .",
    "( the gcss of spirals are generally less populous , and often more difficult to identify , than those in elliptical systems ; thus , the data on late - type galaxies are relatively sparse . ) the square points correspond to dwarf ellipticals and spheroidals , some in the local group ( the two faintest objects are the fornax and sagittarius dwarfs ) and others in the virgo cluster ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; filled circles represent regular giant ellipticals in a wide range of field and cluster environments ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) ; and open circles stand for the centrally located galaxies ( which often are also the brightest ) in a large number of groups and clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "three points are immediately apparent .",
    "first , among normal ge s an average @xmath34 ( roughly , @xmath35 ) is indicated .",
    "second , the specific frequencies of central galaxies in groups and clusters show a systematic departure from this `` typical '' value , increasing strongly towards brighter galaxy magnitudes . and",
    "third , while the brightest of the dwarf ellipticals have @xmath29 comparable to the giants , the ratio increases towards _ fainter _",
    "luminosities in these small systems .",
    "all in all , @xmath29 ranges over more than a factor of 20 in early - type galaxies .",
    "if the ratio @xmath36 were a good approximation to @xmath24 in equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , the implication would be that the basic efficiency of cluster formation also varied drastically  and in a _ non - monotonic _ fashion  from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "this is the first specific frequency problem .",
    "although it has been much discussed in the literature ( see @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite for recent reviews and references ) , no satisfactory explanation ( or prediction ) of it has ever been advanced .    very closely related to this ,",
    "_ local _ specific frequencies may be defined at different projected radii within a single galaxy , by taking the ratio of its gcs surface ( number ) density profile , @xmath37 , and its @xmath27-band light intensity , @xmath38 , normalized as in equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "( this is then proportional to the ratio of cluster and field - star _",
    "mass _ densities , just as in eq .",
    "[ [ eq:3 ] ] . ) beyond an effective radius or so ( where the effects of dynamical evolution on the gcs are presumably minimized ) , it is found in _",
    "some _ galaxies that local specific frequencies _ increase outwards _ ; in others , they remain constant .",
    "equivalently , some galaxies gcss are significantly more extended than their stellar halos , while others gcs and field - star distributions trace each other accurately on large spatial scales . if the simple assumption @xmath39 were applied here , it would appear to suggest that bound stellar clusters were sometimes ( but not always , and for reasons completely unknown ) _ more _ likely to form at _ larger _ distances from the centers of galaxies , in gas that was presumably at lower ambient densities and pressures .",
    "this is the second specific frequency problem .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] illustrates this situation in m87 , the cd galaxy at the center of the virgo cluster and the first system for which the effect was shown convincingly to exist ( @xcite ) .",
    "the solid line in the top panel is the galaxy light profile , derived from the surface photometry of @xcite , and the points trace the projected gcs number densities ( in units of pc@xmath40 and scaled up for a direct comparison with the stellar densities ) from the combined data of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that the radial gradient of @xmath41 is significantly shallower than that of @xmath42 , leading directly to the strongly increasing local specific frequency profile in the bottom panel .    the horizontal line in the bottom of fig",
    ".  [ fig2 ] marks the globally averaged @xmath29 for m87 as a whole : @xmath43 , three times higher than `` normal '' for giant ellipticals ( @xcite ) .",
    "that is , m87 also suffers from the first specific frequency problem .",
    "this is one strong hint that the two @xmath29 problems are really just different aspects of a single basic phenomenon .",
    "what this might be has become clear only with a homogeneous survey of the central galaxies ( simply bcgs hereafter ) in 21 abell clusters by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "blakeslee has found ( see also @xcite ) that the global specific frequencies of bcgs increase systematically with the soft x - ray luminosity ( averaged over @xmath17500-kpc scales ) of the hot gas in their parent clusters .",
    "he then uses the details of this correlation to argue that the number of globulars in the cores of galaxy clusters scales in direct proportion to the total mass there , with one found for every 1@xmath44 of stars , gas , _ and dark matter_. this implies that the first @xmath29 problem stems ( in bcgs , at least ) from a tendency for brighter galaxies to be `` underluminous , '' for the amount of gas and dark matter associated with them , rather than overabundant in globular clusters .",
    "strictly from a star - formation point of view , however , only the baryons are of interest ; thus , @xcite suggest , in essence , that if the dark matter were left out , the global mass ratio    @xmath45    might itself be constant , not only among bcgs but in other galaxies as well .",
    "the first specific frequency problem would still arise more or less as blakeslee suggested , with the ( observed ) larger gas fractions @xmath46 in brighter galaxies resulting also in a higher global @xmath47 .",
    "in addition , @xcite notes that if the local @xmath48defined in the obvious way as a ratio of densities  were also constant as a function of radius in galaxies , then the fact that the x - ray gas in ellipticals tends to be hotter and more spatially extended than the stellar distribution could cause the second specific frequency problem in gas - rich galaxies that also have a high global @xmath29 .",
    "the underlying idea here is , of course , that the present - day sum @xmath49 should be a better indicator of the `` initial '' gas mass in large galaxies , and that equation ( [ eq:4 ] ) may therefore be more accurate than @xmath29 as an estimate of the true cluster formation efficiency in equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "admittedly , @xmath48 is still only an observable _ approximation _ to @xmath24 ; indeed , in a hierarchical universe it may be difficult to say precisely what is meant by @xmath22 in the first place . particularly in a large galaxy which may have accreted gas ( and stars and globulars ) over extended lengths of time , the observable @xmath48 must be viewed as a mass - weighted average over a complex evolutionary history including a potentially large number of galaxy interactions and many discrete star - formation episodes .",
    "however , the current ratio of @xmath26 to @xmath50 does have an essentially universal value in old gcss  including those in regular ge s and early - type dwarfs as well as bcgs  arguing that it may be a good reflection after all of the real @xmath24 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows this first for the _ local _ @xmath51 in m87 and in the bright ellipticals m49 ( also in the virgo cluster ) and ngc 1399 ( bcg in the fornax cluster ) : the ratio of projected gcs mass densities ( @xmath52 ) to the sum of stellar and gas mass densities ( @xmath53 , with @xmath32 measured separately for each system ) is constant beyond an effective radius in the galaxies .",
    "the construction of the individual density profiles is discussed in detail by @xcite , where a comparison of the deprojected quantities is also made , confirming the basic result and giving essentially the same numbers for @xmath48 . evidently , including the gas does alleviate the second specific frequency problem , in just the sense suggested above : @xmath29 increases with radius in m87 because of a locally varying gas - to - star mass ratio , rather than any change in the fundamental @xmath48 ; and in the comparatively gas - poor m49 and ngc 1399",
    ", there is no @xmath29 problem in the first place .",
    "moreover , the first @xmath29 problem is similarly removed when the x - ray gas is taken into account : although the total specific frequencies of m87 , m49 , and ngc 1399 are significantly different ( at 14.1 , 4.7 , and 67 ) , their local gcs mass ratios at large radii are consistent with a single value : @xmath54 in the mean . finally , since this is also independent of galactocentric radius , it is the same as the _ global _ cluster formation efficiency in each case .",
    "these specific examples clearly are consistent with the notion of a universal @xmath24 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] , which essentially re - plots the @xmath29 data in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , confirms it in detail on a global scale . to understand the bold curves in this figure ,",
    "note that equation ( [ eq:4 ] ) and the definition @xmath55 can be written as    @xmath56    the heavy solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is just this equation , with ( i ) @xmath57 fixed ; ( ii ) @xmath27-band galaxy luminosities converted to stellar masses according to the relation @xmath58 ( @xcite ) ; and ( iii ) galaxy - wide gas - to - star mass ratios estimated from a combination of fundamental - plane scalings and the x - ray ",
    "optical luminosity correlation : @xmath59 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the steep upturn in @xmath25 at high @xmath60 ( or the sharp increase in bcg specific frequency ) is thus due to the fast - growing dominance of gas over stars , in the face of a _ constant _ gcs mass fraction . towards lower luminosities , global gas masses become negligible and @xmath29 decreases steadily because of the systematic decrease in @xmath32 for fundamental - plane ellipticals . as a result , at the luminosity of the milky way spheroid ( disk excluded ) , an @xmath48 of 0.0026 also accounts for the number of halo ( metal - poor ) galactic globulars ( open square in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ; see @xcite ) .",
    "-0.2truein    for the early - type dwarf galaxies with @xmath61 , the gas - to - star mass ratio in equation ( [ eq:5 ] ) has a different meaning : the energy of supernova explosions in a single burst of star formation in one of these small galaxies may have sufficed to expel all remaining gas from its dark - matter well , and while any such gas would , of course , no longer be directly observable , a proper estimate of @xmath24 must still account for it . the bold , dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is one attempt to do this .",
    "it represents equation ( [ eq:5 ] ) given ( i ) the relation @xmath62 , from the _ theory _ of @xcite ; ( ii ) a constant @xmath63 for the stellar populations ; and ( iii ) once again , a fixed @xmath64 .",
    "although scatter remains ( at the level of factors of @xmath172 ) in the observed @xmath25 at any given @xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , it is important that this is more or less random ; the mean _ trends _ in gcs population as a function of luminosity  the essence of the first specific frequency problem  can be simply explained if the efficiency of globular cluster formation were constant to first order .",
    "indeed , deviations in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] may reflect the scatter of individual galaxies about either the fundamental plane or the @xmath65@xmath66 correlation used to derive the bold lines there , rather than any significant variations in @xmath24 .",
    "this requires further study on a case - by - case basis , as does the situation in spirals other than the milky way .",
    "similarly , there is some indication ( e.g. , @xcite ) that the simple treatment of galactic winds ( i.e. , the model of @xcite ) used to correct for the gas lost from dwarf galaxies may be inadequate . at this point , however , it is more than plausible to assert that globular clusters formed in de s and dsph s as in larger galaxies , always in the same proportion to the total mass of gas that was initially on hand .",
    "one important consequence of this is that the efficiency of _ unclustered _ star formation in protogalaxies could _ not _ have been universal . in both the faintest de s and the brightest bcgs , globular clusters apparently formed in precisely the numbers expected of them , while anomalously low fractions of the initial gas mass were converted into field stars . in the case of the dwarfs specifically , if even just the idea of the feedback correction above is basically correct then all the globulars had to have formed by the time a galactic wind cleared the remaining gas ; but this must have happened before normal numbers of field stars appeared .",
    "thus , _ the gas which formed bound star clusters had to have collapsed more rapidly than that which produced unbound groups and associations_. this implies that it was only those pieces of gas which locally exceeded some critical density that were able to attain the cumulative star formation efficiency of @xmath6750% required to form a bound stellar cluster .",
    "in addition to this , the uniformity of @xmath48 argues  applying as it does over large ranges of radius inside m87 , m49 , and ngc 1399 , and from dwarfs in the field to bcgs in the cores of abell clusters  that the probability of realizing such a high sfe depended very weakly , if at all , on local or global protogalactic environment .",
    "quantitative theories of cluster formation should therefore seek to identify a _ threshold in relative density _",
    ", @xmath68 , that is always exceeded by @xmath690.26% of the mass fluctuations in any large body of star - forming gas .",
    "the `` relative '' aspect of such a criterion is crucial ; the gcs data militate strongly against any model relying on parameters that are too sensitive to environment .",
    "one such example is the scenario of @xcite , in which the pressure exerted by a diffuse medium surrounding a dense clump of gas must exceed a fixed , absolute value in order to produce a high local @xmath70 and a bound stellar cluster .",
    "however , since pressures vary by orders of magnitude in going from de s to bcgs , or from large to small radii in any one galaxy , this idea seems to imply _ systematic _ variations in @xmath24 that are not observed .",
    "bcgs present a complex problem in larger - scale galaxy formation , but it is worth noting that a feedback argument like that applied to dwarfs may also be relevant to central cluster galaxies like m87 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "that is , globulars likely also appeared quickly , and in normal numbers , in the densest of star - forming clumps ( perhaps embedded in dwarf - sized fragments ) in these deep potential wells .",
    "the gas more slowly forming field stars could have been virialized thereafter , or moved outwards in slow , partial galactic winds .",
    "the unused gas in this case would have to remain hot to the present day , and more or less in the vicinity of the parent galaxy , in order to appear as the x - ray emitting gas that makes @xmath71 so constant in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ; but this requirement is certainly consistent with the bcgs being at the centers of clusters .",
    "in addition , the feedback in this scenario would have more effectively truncated the star formation in the lower - density environs at larger galactocentric radii in these very large systems , thus giving rise to the second specific frequency problem as well .",
    "there are other possibilities for bcgs , however .",
    "it is conceivable , for instance , that their `` excess '' gas and globulars were both produced elsewhere in galaxy clusters ( in failed dwarfs ? ) and fell together onto the central galaxies over a long period of time .",
    "these questions need to be examined in much more detail .",
    "finally , @xcite argues that the current efficiency of _ open _ cluster formation in the galactic disk is also @xmath170.20.4% by mass .",
    "this figure is much more uncertain than it is in gcss , and it is essentially an _ instantaneous _ variant of the time - averaged quantity measured for globular clusters .",
    "nevertheless , it clearly suggests that whatever quantitative criterion is ultimately required to explain @xmath72 in gcss may very well prove to be of much wider applicability .",
    "( one exception _ may _ be the formation of massive clusters in mergers and starbursts , where it has been suggested that @xmath7310% [ e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ]",
    ". however , this conclusion is very uncertain and requires more careful investigation . )",
    "the focus to this point has been on the _ frequency _ with which @xmath17@xmath74@xmath75 clumps of gas were able to form stars with a cumulative efficiency @xmath70 high enough to produce a bound globular cluster .",
    "the impressive regularity of this occurrence is clearly important , as has just been discussed , and its rarity is significant as well : the small value of @xmath72 implies that the local sfe in an _ average _ bit of protogalactic gas was much lower than @xmath760.5 ( a fact which is also true of molecular gas in the galaxy today ) .",
    "however , these results say nothing of _ how _ an extreme @xmath70 comes about in any individual gas clump .",
    "this is another open problem in star formation generally .",
    "its solution requires both an understanding of local star formation laws ( @xmath77 as a function of @xmath78 ) and a self - consistent treatment of feedback on small ( @xmath1710100 pc ) scales .",
    "the whole issue is essentially one of energetics in a compact , gravitationally bound association of gas and embedded young stars : when does the combined energy injected by all the massive stars equal the binding energy of whatever gas remains ?",
    "this point of equality and the corresponding @xmath70 can in principle be identified for any given star formation law and a set of initial conditions in the original gas .",
    "the difficulty lies , of course , in deciphering what these are ; but once this is done , progress will also have been made in understanding the probability of obtaining @xmath79 , i.e. , the overall efficiency of cluster formation in  [ sec:2 ] .",
    "one way to begin addressing this complex set of problems empirically is to compare the final binding energies of stellar clusters with the initial energies of their gaseous progenitors .",
    "this is a straightforward exercise for the ensemble of globular clusters in the milky way .",
    "@xcite evaluated the binding energies @xmath80 for about 10 bright galactic globulars , along with a number of dwarf and giant ellipticals .",
    "he claimed that @xmath81 for ge s and globulars alike , while the dwarfs fell systematically below this relation ( a fact which he subsequently attributed to the effects of large - scale feedback such as discussed above [ @xcite ; but cf .",
    "@xcite ] ) .",

    "now , in the context of @xcite models , any globular cluster is fully defined by the specification of just four ( nominally ) independent physical quantities . given the results just presented , it is natural to choose these to be @xmath95 , @xmath100 , the total @xmath101 , and the concentration parameter @xmath102 .",

    "it is then important that the @xmath2 and @xmath105 correlations are stronger among clusters outside the solar circle ( filled circles in the plots ) than among those within it ( open circles ) . given the relative weakness of dynamical evolution at such large @xmath99 , this is one indication that these fundamental properties of the galactic gcs were set largely by the cluster _ formation _ process ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] finally compares the globular cluster energies to estimates for the initial values in their progenitors .",

    "in particular , the column densities of the protoclusters are postulated to be independent of mass but decreasing with galactocentric radius : @xmath106 @xmath107 , which follows from the clumps being in hydrostatic equilibrium and from their parent clouds being themselves surrounded in a diffuse medium virialized in a `` background '' isothermal potential well with a circular velocity of 220 km s@xmath108 .",
    "this relation then implies @xmath109 , which is drawn as the broken line in fig .",
    "_ by construction , this is precisely the mass - energy relation obeyed today by the massive clumps in molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood . _ intriguingly , it is also the @xmath110@xmath80 scaling originally claimed by @xcite for giant elliptical galaxies and ( bright ) globular clusters .",
    "the dependence of @xmath80 on @xmath99 in such protoclusters is nearly the same as that actually found for the globulars today .",

    "[ fig6 ] , the two are taken for convenience to be identical , so that the comparison between model and observed binding energies there is valid at any given galactocentric position .",
    "the difference in the _ slopes _ of the two @xmath111 relations is significant : the ratio of the initial energy of a gaseous clump to the final @xmath80 of a stellar cluster is unavoidably a function of its cumulative star formation efficiency @xmath70 ; but fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows that this ratio of energies changes systematically as a function of mass , and thus that @xmath70 varied as well .",
    "moreover , the fact that the difference between initial and final @xmath80 is largest at the lowest masses implies that _ @xmath70 had to have been lower in lower - mass protoglobulars_. the details of this behavior must rely on the density and velocity structure of the initial gas ; the timescale over which feedback expels unused gas ; re - expansion of the stars after such gas loss ; and other such specifics which are model - dependent to some extent .",
    "the inference on the qualitative behavior of @xmath70 as a function of protocluster gas mass is , however , robust .    a more quantitative discussion of fig .",
