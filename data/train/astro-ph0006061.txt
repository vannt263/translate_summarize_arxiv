    "the z and atoll sources are thought to be x - ray binaries containing low - magnetic - field ( @xmath0@xmath1 gauss ) neutron stars ( as many of the atoll , and least one of the z sources , show x - ray bursts ) accreting from a low mass ( @xmath2m@xmath3 ) companion star . use of x - ray ` colour - colour ' and/or ` hardness - intensity ' diagrams ( ccds / hids ) and high - sensitivity x - ray timing have provided a wealth of information on the accretion processes in these sources .",
    "together , the two groups encompass all the brightest low - mass x - ray binaries , and they are clustered in the direction of the galactic bulge .",
    "see e.g. van der klis ( 1995 , 1999 ) for reviews of their x - ray properties .",
    "all the z sources , and at least one of the atoll - sources , have been detected at radio wavelengths ( see e.g. penninx 1989 ; hjellming & han 1995 ; fender & hendry 2000 ) . as with all x - ray binaries detected at radio wavelengths ,",
    "high brightness temperatures appear to preclude thermal emission processes , and synchrotron emission is the favoured emission mechanism . however , other measurements , notably detection of linear polarisation , are required to confirm this interpretation . in several cases high resolution radio observations",
    "have resolved the radio emission into jet - like structures , sometimes with components moving at relativistic velocities ( e.g. hjellming & han 1995 ; fender , bell burnell & waltman 1997 ; mirabel & rodrguez 1999 ) .    the radio emission from the atoll and",
    "z sources shares some common properties with that of the persistent black hole x - ray binaries ( fender & hendry 2000 ) which suggests that their low intrinsic magnetic fields ( believed to be @xmath4 g ) have little effect on the accretion / acceleration process ( at least for values of the accretion rate near to the eddington limit ) . the major influence on the acceleration of radio - emitting relativistic electrons must be the state of the accretion disc , itself determined by the accretion rate .",
    "thus at all times we should expect to see some relation between behaviour in x - ray timing and spectra and radio timing and spectra .",
    "apart from the unusual source gx 13 + 1 ( and probably also gx 354 + 0  mart et al .",
    "1998 ) , no atoll source has been reliably detected at more than one epoch .",
    "previous upper limits can be found in grindlay & seaquist ( 1986 ) , nelson & spencer ( 1988 ) , cooke & ponman ( 1991 ) ; see hjellming & han ( 1995 ) for more details .",
    "on 1998 april 1 and 4 we observed several low - mass x - ray binaries in the direction of the galactic centre with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) contemporaneously with x - ray observations of the region with the sax wide field camera ( wfc ) .",
    "in addition we have used xte all sky monitor ( asm ) data to judge the longer - term trend in the x - ray behaviour of the sources around the times of our observations .      [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the importance of these relative astrometric measurements is twofold .",
    "firstly , given the crowded nature of the galactic centre region at optical and infrared wavelengths , very accurate coordinates are required to confidently identify the counterpart to the x - ray and radio source .",
    "this is well illustrated by the recent discussion about the true infrared counterpart to gx 17 + 2 ( deutsch et al .",
    "our best position for this source is consistent with the weighted j2000 position presented in deutsch et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and supports their assertion that np ser is _ not _ the optical / ir counterpart to the x - ray source .",
    "the infrared counterpart to gx 13 + 1 is more confidently determined ( naylor , charles & longmore 1991 ; bandyopadhyay et al .",
    "our new very accurate coordinates for gx 5 - 1 have recently been utilised to finally identify the probable infrared counterpart to this source ( jonker et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "secondly , there is a large uncertainty in distance to most of these sources .",
    "future accurate relative astrometry will allow measurements of relative proper motions of the sources to be made to see whether they agree with the galactic rotation curve for the galactic centre distance , and/or posess high peculiar velocities as inferred recently for the unusual x - ray binary cir x-1 ( johnston , fender & wu 1999 ) .",
    "we have demonstrated the usefulness of coordinating x - ray and radio observations of low - mass x - ray binaries . in the absence of large - scale programs and/or the next generation of radio telscopes ,",
    "we believe that such snapshots of the x - ray and radio state of these systems is the best way to build up a comprehensive ( empirical ) understanding of the x - ray : radio relation and hence the accretion disc : jet coupling in these systems .",
    "we thank bob sault for useful discussions . the australia telescope is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",

    "<S> we have performed simultaneous x - ray and radio observations of thirteen galactic centre low - mass x - ray binaries in 1998 april using the wide - field cameras onboard bepposax and the australia telescope compact array , the latter simultaneously at 4.8 and 8.64 ghz . </S>",

    "<S> upper limits , which are significantly deeper than previous non - detections , are placed on the radio emission from two more z sources and seven atoll sources . </S>",
    "<S> hardness - intensity diagrams constructed from the wide - field camera data reveal gx 17 + 2 and gx 5 - 1 to have been on the lower part of the horizontal branch and/or the upper part of the normal branch , at the time of the observations , and the two non - detected z sources , gx 340 + 0 and gx 349 + 2 , to have been on the lower part of the normal branch . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the previous empirically - determined relation between radio and x - ray emission from z sources , in which radio emission is strongest on the horizontal branch and weakest on the flaring branch . </S>",
    "<S> for the first time we have information on the x - ray state of atoll sources , which are clearly radio - quiet relative to the z sources , during periods of observed radio upper limits . </S>",
    "<S> we place limits on the linear polarisation from the three detected sources , and use accurate radio astrometry of gx 17 + 2 to confirm that it is probably not associated with the optical star np ser . </S>",
