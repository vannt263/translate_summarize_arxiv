    "first comparisons of the leading order calculations  @xcite with experimental data have clearly demonstrated the need of next - to - leading order calculations : both in the @xmath3 measurements at lep and in dis at hera the data are below the leading @xmath4 ( ll ) curves , while data from the @xmath5 collider at tevatron are found above the ll estimates .",

    "it is one of the main goals of our analysis to show that both types of contributions can successfully be identified and separated from the nll jet vertex .    as the central part of our calculation we will compute , to order @xmath7 , the high energy limit of the cross section of the processes @xmath8 ( fig .",

    "the nll calculation determines how the cross section changes with a change in @xmath13 and removes this uncertainty .",

    "we will be interested in the high energy limit of the subprocess @xmath34 .",
    "in addition to the energy @xmath11 , we need to define the momentum transfer @xmath35 and the jet energy @xmath33 : @xmath36 the high energy ( regge ) limit that we are considering is defined by @xmath37 which determines a logarithmic growth of the jet rapidity with @xmath11 : @xmath38 the use of perturbation theory is justified because we consider all kinematic scales much greater than the qcd scale : @xmath39 this condition allows also us to neglect the masses and the fermi motion of the light partons inside @xmath15 .",
    "equivalently , in terms of the twist expansion , the leading twist contribution can be extracted by considering the parton massless and collinear to @xmath15 .",
    "we shall therefore adopt @xmath40    it is well known that the regge limit is dominated by gluon @xmath41-channel exchanges  @xcite and that , in the leading logarithmic approximation , the elastic scattering amplitude and the total cross section can be written in a factorizing form : _ ( i ) _ a gluon green s function which describes the exchanged system , and _",

    "this choice is represented by a function ( actually a distribution ) @xmath43 which selects the final state configurations contributing to the observable we are interested in .",

    "@xcite , and we require _ the partonic impact factors to include singularities of collinear origin only_. such a prescription may sound somewhat academic , because partonic impact factors have no phenomenological application and interpretation .",

    "namely , at the lower end of the diagram , where the coupling of the reggeized gluon to the incoming parton is described by the jet vertex ( more precisely , by the convolution @xmath262 which we may call `` jet impact factor '' ) it is mandatory that its singularity structure matches the one required by collinear factorization . only in this case @xmath52 can be identified as the usual parton density with one - loop corrections  ( [ deff1 ] ) , and only with this prescription the remaining jet vertex @xmath263 is finite . as we shall see in the next section , the jet distribution function helps to disentangle this structure from the leading log part in a very natural way , but the basic requirement is the matching of the singularity structure with the collinear singularities .    in our approach",
    "we therefore insist on the collinear properties of any impact factor .",

    "( [ defucal ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , even with this requirement on the singularity structure there is still some freedom in the definition of the impact factor  essentially a factorization - scheme arbitrariness  which corresponds to changes in its finite ( in @xmath139 ) part .",
    "it is possible to show that the `` good '' collinear properties of the impact factors are preserved , provided the angular ordering prescription in the leading term is fulfilled in the soft ( small @xmath268 ) region , while the details of the subtraction at finite @xmath219 or @xmath269 affect only the finite part .",
    "returning to the evaluation of leading term , one might think of two different strategies .",

    "( [ ucalciafa ] ) , where the energy scale @xmath271 ( the denominator in the argument of the log ) , being a function of @xmath220 and @xmath98 , is determined by the particular ll subtraction , i.e. , by @xmath249 .",
    "if we adopt , for instance , the angular ordering prescription in the whole range of @xmath219 , i.e. , @xmath272 , the energy scale is @xmath273 . in this case",
    "the new impact factor differs from eq .",

    "another theoretical issue of interest is the dependence upon the scales . in leading order ,",
    "results of the bfkl calculations and the jet vertex are insensitive to both the energy scale @xmath13 and to the renormalization scale @xmath134 .",
    "it is only at the nlo level that the dependence on these scales is being determined .",
    "the central result of our calculation is the expression  ( [ v1 ] ) for the nlo jet vertex . using the factorization property  ( [ ff ] )",
    ", we can use our result also for the upper incoming quark @xmath16 , i.e. , for the ` symmetric ' mueller - navelet jet production process @xmath396 . as the final step",
    ", we will have to allow for the production of an arbitrary number of gluons between the jets which is described by the nlo bfkl pomeron .",
    "this step will be presented in the companion paper containing the nlo gluon - initiated jet vertex .    with our expression for the jet vertex we have provided a finite integral that can be computed numerically , e.g. via monte - carlo integration .",
    "such a numerical study requires to specify the jet algorithm described by the function @xmath184 : so far we been rather general , but clearly the numerical results will depend on the choice of the jet algorithm .",
