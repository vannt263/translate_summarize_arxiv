    "bars are a common feature of spiral galaxies , with near - ir imaging revealing that the majority have some bar structure in their central regions , while strong bars are seen in about one - third of spirals @xcite .",
    "much theoretical and observational effort has recently been devoted to the possible role of bars in driving morphological change in their host galaxies . in particular , tidal torques from bars are thought to lead to central concentration of disk gas , with the resulting star formation causing the build - up of ` pseudobulges ' ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , the strongest evidence for this process is from theoretical simulations , and the direct observational evidence is not yet compelling .",
    "a central issue is the lifetime and duty cycle of bars : is a barred galaxy always a barred galaxy , and if not , how long does the bar phase endure ?",
    "theoretical results are not clear .",
    "one aspect of this question is the long - term stability of bars in the presence of a central mass concentration such as a super - massive black hole .",
    "the most comprehensive study into this question , by @xcite found that bars are robust to the effects of plausible central masses ( up to several per cent of the disk mass ) , a result that was confirmed by the models of @xcite .",
    "some other studies contradict this conclusion , with models that indicate a possible role for central mass concentrations in dissolving bars rapidly @xcite .",
    "simulations by @xcite and @xcite show that bars can be stable for at least 5 and 10  gyr respectively , while @xcite find characteristic bar lifetimes of a hubble time or more .",
    "other studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that bars may be induced by external phenomena such as galaxy  galaxy tidal interactions , which would predict a broad spread of bar ages .",
    "observationally , @xcite and @xcite have attempted to address this question using optical spectroscopy to determine ages and metallicities along bars in 20 nearby early - type barred galaxies , finding a wide range in luminosity - weighted ages of the stellar populations .",
    "however , the age of the stellar population is not simply related to the age of the bar itself , and indeed @xcite presents models predicting significant age differences within a given bar due to trapping of young stars at orbital resonances .",
    "thus , we suggest here a complementary technique , based on the influence of the bar on the star formation ( sf ) activity in its surrounding environment , rather than within the bar itself .",
    "this paper builds on the results of a recent h@xmath1 spectroscopic study of 15 nearby barred galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth jp15 ) .",
    "these galaxies had previously been identified @xcite as having a specific pattern of emission in continuum - subtracted narrow - band h@xmath1 imaging , with a pronounced dip in this emission in the radial range swept out by the bar .",
    "this region was termed the ` star formation desert ' ( sfd ) , a terminology we follow in the present paper .",
    "this behaviour is clearly apparent in the h@xmath1 images presented for the 4 galaxies in the present study , in figs .",
    "14 , all showing regions devoid of h@xmath1 emission over a radial range that corresponds closely with the bar extent .",
    "this characteristic sf pattern is confirmed by other indicators , e.g. three of the galaxies studied here ( all except for ngc  2712 ) have galex ultra - violet light profiles presented by @xcite , all of which show distinctive peaks or plateaus of red far - uv  near - uv colours in the radial range corresponding to the sfd .",
    "further confirmation comes from @xcite who demonstrate a deficit of core - collapse supernovae in barred galaxies over the radial ranges corresponding to sfds , again confirming the suppression of sf in these regions .",
    "note that , in adopting a functional definition of the regions studied in terms of star - formation properties , we deliberately side - step the thorny terminological and classification issues of whether we are studying bulges , outer bulges , pseudo - bulges , disks , lenses or ` barlenses ' .",
    "the deep long - slit optical spectroscopy presented in jp15 shows that most of these sfd regions do in fact have diffuse h@xmath1 line emission , at a very low level that is not picked up by narrow - band imaging .",
    "however , such emission was found always to have [ nii]/h@xmath1 line ratios very different from those found from star - formation regions ; this and the extended diffuse morphology led us to conclude that the emission is not powered by sf , but more probably by post - asymptotic giant branch stars or shocks from the bar .",
    "such emission was also found , using rather different methods , in galaxies studied by @xcite .",
    "this suppression of sf over intermediate radial ranges was anticipated by @xcite , who proposed bar - induced shocks as an efficient method for producing such suppression effects .    in this paper , we attempt to constrain the longevity of bar activity by an analysis of the sfd regions of 4 of the galaxies studied in jp15 .",
    "we present additional h@xmath0 long - slit spectroscopic observations for these galaxies , and compare measured absorption line strengths with predictions from population synthesis models to constrain the time since the cessation of sf activity .",
    "one important aspect of this analysis is a robust and self - consistent treatment of the effects of line emission on observed absorption - line strengths , given our finding of near - ubiquitous but low - level line emission in these regions .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : gal_obs ] contains a description of the observed galaxies and their main properties , and lists the new spectroscopic observations used in this analysis . in section  [ sec : dat_red ] we describe the data reduction that was performed to extract absorption line strengths from long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "the data analysis presented in section  [ sec : analysis ] includes a description of the iterative procedure adopted to correct line indices for the effects of line emission , and presents the theoretical population synthesis models with which the corrected indices are compared .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] contains the discussion of the main results in terms of stellar population ages and their consequences for our understanding of bar activity .",
    "the main conclusions are summarised in section  [ sec : conc_fut_work ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,>,^,^ , > , > \" , ]     [ tab : hb_indices ]    the intrinsic h@xmath1/h@xmath0 emission line ratio of 2.85 that was adopted above is used widely in the literature , but generally for regions ionized by hot stars .",
    "@xcite , following @xcite , prefer a higher ratio of 3.1 for low ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) type sources , noting that h@xmath1 emission strength is boosted in regions dominated by collisional excitation . given that the sfd regions in these barred galaxies show liner - like [ nii]/h@xmath1 ratios ( jp15 ) , these higher h@xmath1/h@xmath0 ratios may be more appropriate here .",
    "adopting a ratio of 3.1 reduces the emission - line correction by about 10 per cent , resulting in corrected ew values that are lower by between 0.014 and 0.050   .",
    "extinction will also act to increase the effective h@xmath1/h@xmath0 ratio , thus weakening this correction and decreasing the corrected absorption ew .",
    "extinction in these sfd regions is largely unconstrained , but we note that they are visually smooth and show no evidence of patchy dust obscuration , and so we apply no extinction correction .    given the significant uncertainties in this emission - line correction process , we assume that it contributes an error equal to 50 per cent of the size of the final correction .",
    "this error is much larger than , for example , the changes that would result from adopting any of the h@xmath1/h@xmath0 intrinsic emission line ratios resulting from different stellar and non - stellar processes investigated by @xcite and listed in their table  3 .",
    "the absorption - corrected h@xmath0 indices , combined with mgb metallicity - sensitive indices , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfd_sspgrid ] .",
    "this shows that the index strengths are matched by ssps with ages ranging between 3 and 14  gyr .",
    "[ fig : sfd_sspgrid ] also indicates that the stellar populations appear to have moderately sub - solar metallicities , with most of the sfd points lying between [ fe / h ] of + 0.06 and 0.66 .",
    "this is slightly surprising for regions towards the centres of intrinsically luminous spiral galaxies , where metallicities similar to solar or somewhat higher might be expected . given the shape of the ssp age - metallicity grid , shifting the points to somewhat higher metallicities would result in somewhat younger mean ages , but it is still clear that most of the measured points would indicate old stellar populations in these sfd regions , with equivalent ssp ages of several billion years .",
    "absorption feature as a function of the time since sf activity was truncated , for solar metallicity populations.,width=302 ]    one limitation of the above analysis was the comparison with ssp models , which will poorly represent the properties of any components of a real galaxy , where sf histories are likely to be temporally extended and complex . in this section ,",
    "we attempt to include , at least to first order , the effects of a more realistic sf history .",
    "we do this by calculating index strengths from stellar populations with sf rates that are constant in time over an interval starting 13  gyr ago , and ending at a truncation epoch which we vary from 4  gyr to 50  myr ago .",
    "while such a model is clearly a simplification of the true history , this assumption gives a one - parameter set of models which is better suited to the specific question we address here than are , for example , the mass- and luminosity - weighted effective ages of stellar populations resulting from the more sophisticated full spectrum fitting of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : trunc_spec ] shows examples of the modeled spectra , using the basti models and spectral library @xcite .",
    "the figure shows the decreasing depth of the h@xmath0 feature as the truncation epoch is pushed back from 50  myr ( top spectrum ) to 4  gyr ( bottom ) .",
    "this is the same trend in h@xmath0 strength with age as is shown in the ssp models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ssp_spec ] ) , but with ew values overall being lower due to the effects of the oldest stars which are present in all models . the grid of the h@xmath0 index vs the mgb index shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfd_emcorpluserrors ] quantifies the variation in h@xmath0 with the epoch of last sf , showing particularly strong variation over the range 0.1 - 2  gyr .",
    "this is well matched to the requirements for discriminating between the theoretical possibilities outlined in the introduction ; if bars typically persist for only a few rotations , the observations should populate the upper part of the grid shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfd_emcorpluserrors ] , whereas a continuation of the current sf pattern for several gyr should lead to an old population in the sfd regions , populating the bottom of the diagram .",
    "ew with time since truncation of sf activity .",
    "the grid points and overlaid data points correspond to equivalent widths of the appropriate features using the same wavelength ranges , defined in trager et al .",
    "the data points are determined from spectra taken in the sfd regions on opposite sides of the nucleus of 4 barred galaxies ( solid square , ngc  2543 ; open square , ngc  2712 ; open circle , ngc  3185 ; solid circle , ngc  3351 ) , and the h@xmath0 index strengths have been corrected for the presence of diffuse line emission .",
    "the dashed line at the bottom of the plot corresponds to ssps of age 14  gyr .",
    ", width=302 ]    these observations have yielded age estimates for the two sfd regions in each of the four barred galaxies , shown in fig . [",
    "fig : sfd_emcorpluserrors ] .",
    "all eight regions indicate that sf has been curtailed for at least the last 1  gyr , and hence that bars are likely to be long - lived features .",
    "however , significant differences are evident in the ages revealed by our spectroscopic analysis , with the sfd regions in two galaxies ( ngc  3185 and ngc  3351 ) having very old populations , while ngc  2543 and ngc  2712 have evidence for more recent truncation of sf , within the last @xmath22  gyr .",
    "we discuss the consequences of these findings in the next section .",
    "when discussing the implications of these implied sf histories , it is important to stress that we are studying the radial range which lies in the heart of the star - forming disk in unbarred galaxies , as illustrated by fig .  1 of jp15 .",
    "this is a key point for this analysis , and has not been addressed in previous studies of stellar populations and sf histories of barred galaxies . to make this point more quantitative ,",
    "we have estimated the fraction of total sf that might be expected in an unbarred galaxy in the radial range covered by the extracted sfd slit spectra for each of the 4 galaxies studied .",
    "this was done using averaged h@xmath1 profiles for unbarred galaxies of the same hubble @xmath3-type ( sb or sa ) , taken from @xcite .",
    "the resulting fractions are : for ngc  2543 , 33 per cent ; for ngc  2712 , 26 per cent ; for ngc  3185 , 37 per cent ; and for ngc  3351 , 15 per cent , with the smaller value for the last galaxy being due to its shorter bar .",
    "thus it is clearly not the case that we are simply determining the age of the old stellar population expected in bulge regions of galaxies ; these observations cover a radial range that in unbarred but otherwise similar galaxies is characterised by disk regions with very vigorous sf activity .",
    "the first finding from our spectroscopic analysis is that the stellar populations in sfd regions can be very old .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings of @xcite for four different barred galaxies , although their analysis methods were quite different .",
    "old stellar populations have also been found _ within _ bars by some studies @xcite , in general agreement with our results , but note that in this case it is not clear how to relate these ages to the bar age ( an old population could have been assembled into a bar morphology very recently ) .",
    "however , one of our galaxies is consistent with sf having been truncated only 1  gyr ago , and another between 1 and 2 gyr ago .",
    "thus we find a significant range in stellar population properties , even within a small sample of four early - type barred galaxies .",
    "one advantage of the analysis method adopted is that we get two measurements of the sfd stellar populations within each galaxy , on opposite sides of the nucleus . given that the reduction of each region is completely independent of all the others ( so that , for example , all of the parameters defining the emission - line correction are locally - derived and not averaged across both galaxy regions ) , it is reassuring to note that the line indices measured are entirely consistent for all of the pairs of spectra within individual galaxies .",
    "thus , we do not find any indications of variation in stellar population properties within any of these four galaxies .",
    "that is not true for the range of index strengths across the full sample of four galaxies , which is much larger than would be expected from measurement errors alone , indicating real differences in population ages or truncation epochs between these galaxies .",
    "the galaxy sample studied here is too small for any formal statistical analysis , but it is instructive to look for correlations between sfd population ages and other galaxy properties .",
    "the youngest population is found for the sfd of ngc  2543 ( the two points lying on the 1  gyr truncation age in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfd_emcorpluserrors ] ) ; this is classified as an sbb , with quite vigorous sf in the disk outside the sfd region . the second youngest is found in ngc  2712 , another sbb with very strong disk sf , that is morphologically very similar to ngc  2543 .",
    "there is then a significant jump to greater sfd age for ngc  3351 , which is also classified as sbb .",
    "the oldest population age is found for ngc  3185 , the one galaxy in this sample classified as sba , and the one that shows weakest ( but still clearly detected ) disk sf in its h@xmath1 image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n3185 ] , lower frame ) .    figures 14 show that these spectra sample regions that are significantly offset from the main bar axis . however , there is some variation in this offset , with two galaxies observed with the slit perpendicular to the bar ( ngc  2543 and ngc  3351 ) while ngc  2712 and ngc  3185 were observed at smaller angular offsets of 38@xmath4 and 27@xmath4 respectively .",
    "this is potentially significant , given that the bar models of @xcite and @xcite suggest that significant numbers of young stars may be trapped within the bar .",
    "however , there is no sign of such effects in the present sample , and indeed the youngest sfd population is found for ngc  2543 , one of the cases where the slit was perpendicular to the bar and no contribution from the bar light can be expected .",
    "given the small size of the present sample , and the lack of spectra taken very close to the bar axis , we can not make any strong statements about the predictions of @xcite and @xcite , but this is an important question for future studies of this type .    while we confirm the result of jp15 that the sfd regions of the four galaxies studied have heavily suppressed sf rates , all four galaxies have strong emission - line peaks at their bar centres .",
    "the observations presented in jp15 include the central regions of all four galaxies , although central properties were not discussed in that paper .",
    "the observed [ nii]/h@xmath1 central - region line ratios are consistent with expectations for sf in the nucleus of one galaxy ( ngc  2543 ) , in central rings in two others ( ngc  2712 and ngc  3185 ) , and in both nucleus and central ring for the remaining galaxy ( ngc  3351 ) .",
    "this confirms the general finding of other studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that bars can efficiently induce sf in the central regions of their host galaxies , and we show here that such sf can co - exist with the sfd phenomenon .    many studies have discussed the possibility of radial migration of stars .",
    "this was first introduced as an effect that is driven by spiral arm patterns at their corotation resonances @xcite .",
    "other studies have explored the possible effects of bar  spiral arm coupling on radial migration @xcite , although the evidence for strong bar - driven migration is not widely accepted @xcite , and @xcite argue against strong radial mixing in their study of metallicity gradients in barred and unbarred galaxies . if such radial mixing _ does _ occur , it would complicate the interpretation of the results presented here .",
    "however , any mixing of the young stellar populations from either the central sf peak or the surrounding sf ring into the sfd region would only strengthen the general result we find here , of long - suppressed sf activity within the sfd region itself .",
    "one obvious extension of the analysis presented here would be to look at the stellar populations in the disk outside the sfd , but between hii regions , to determine the characteristic age of the non - star - forming disk population .",
    "this was attempted with the present long - slit data , but did not prove feasible , as any line - free regions were very small and of such low surface brightness that it was impossible to fit any absorption line features in any such disk regions .",
    "this demonstrates the unique nature of the sfd regions as extensive , relatively high surface brightness areas that are free of ongoing star formation .",
    "the analysis of outer disk regions might be possible using integral field units , through the co - addition of spectra covering large areas with the removal of all those showing line emission .",
    "as noted in jp15 , the analysis presented here only applies to a particular type of bar , that is characteristic of early - type spirals and is not found in late types .",
    "future areas of study include extending this type of analysis to such later type strongly barred galaxies , to determine whether the bimodality in bar types noted by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite is reflected in the associated stellar populations .",
    "it would also be useful to apply the methods of the present study to the stellar population found within the body of the bar itself .",
    "future studies might also be able to constrain radial migration effects by looking for age gradients in the outer parts of the sfd , as the star - forming ring is approached .",
    "the principal conclusions of this study are as follows :    * we confirm the sf pattern found in our earlier study , for four strongly - barred galaxies , with a central peak and an outer ring both showing strong activity , and an intermediate ` desert ' where sf is strongly suppressed . *",
    "it is important to correct appropriately for low - level diffuse line emission , identified in all four of these galaxies ; failure to do this results in significantly overestimated population ages .",
    "* we derive two independent estimates of sfd ages per galaxy , which are internally consistent for each of the four galaxies . *",
    "overall we find old stellar populations in sfd regions , indicate that sf was truncated at least several dynamical times ago .",
    "* however , there is a large range in ages or truncation epochs found across the sample of four galaxies , not consistent with expectations from measurement errors alone . *",
    "further work is required to extend this analysis to statistically significant samples of galaxies , covering a wider range of galaxy types , and to constrain complicating effects such as radial migration of stars .",
