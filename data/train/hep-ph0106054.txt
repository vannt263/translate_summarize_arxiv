    "evidence for small but nonzero neutrino masses has been mounting over the years from experiments on atmospheric @xcite , solar @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrinos .",
    "all experiments point toward a spectrum where the neutrino masses are less than or of order 1 ev .",
    "this is the first experimental challenge to the standard model , for its structure and particle content , taken as a stand  alone renormalizable field theory ,",
    "do not allow for nonzero neutrino masses .",
    "new ingredients must be introduced in order to accommodate massive neutrinos ; and the race is on to find the underlying new physics .",
    "while it is possible to accommodate neutrino masses , @xmath2 , by modifying the low  energy particle content of the standard model , the smallness of @xmath2 will remain a puzzle in such attempts .",
    "consider , for example , introducing an @xmath3 triplet scalar field which acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and generates majorana masses for the left  handed neutrinos @xcite . either the vev of the triplet or the relevant yukawa couplings must be exceedingly small in order to generate @xmath2 of order 1 ev .",
    "similarly , if right ",
    "handed neutrinos are introduced into the low energy spectrum so that dirac masses can be generated , the smallness of the relevant yukawa couplings ( @xmath4 ) would beg for an explanation .",
    "a more natural explanation for the smallness of @xmath2 is that they are generated ( via some underlying new physics ) at a scale @xmath5 higher than the electroweak scale corresponds to the scale at which lepton number conservation is violated . ] and manifest themselves at low energies through effective higher dimensional ( @xmath6 ) operators which are suppressed by appropriate powers of @xmath5 .",
    "one can then understand on purely dimensional ground why the @xmath2 are small , without precise knowledge of the underlying new physics .",
    "as an example of this effective operator description , consider the well  known seesaw mechanism @xcite . here",
    "the underlying theory has a modified particle content , viz . , the addition of heavy right  handed neutrinos . upon integrating out these heavy fields ,",
    "one arrives at an effective theory without the right  handed neutrinos , but with a set of dimension 5 operators @xcite which can generate small majorana masses for the left  handed neutrinos .",
    "while the @xmath7 seesaw operators are the lowest dimensional effective neutrino mass operators , there may be situations in which they are not the suitable ones .",
    "for instance , as exemplified in many of the models discussed in sec .",
    "iii , there may be selection rules which forbid their presence .",
    "such selection rules may be necessary for models in which the lepton number ( l ) breaking scale @xmath5 is sufficiently low will be of order the planck scale which can be as low as a few tev in some of the scenarios that speculate the existence of large extra dimensions . ]",
    "that the @xmath7 operators would generate too large a neutrino mass ( larger than o(1 ) ev ) .",
    "in such cases , the dominant contributions to the neutrino mass will come from operators with dimension higher than 5 , typically through radiative corrections . in view of the current interests in neutrino mass models",
    ", it will be useful to identify all potentially relevant neutrino mass operators .",
    "we list in this paper all such effective operators and estimate the size of the neutrino mass they generate . in",
    "so doing we will reproduce many of the neutrino mass models that already exist in the literature and find a systematic way to arrive at new models .",
    "it should be noted that this effective operator approach has been widely used in other studies of possible new physics @xcite , in particular , baryon number violation and proton decays @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in operators that can lead to a mass term for the left  handed neutrino fields in the standard model , the operators must violate lepton number by two units , i.e. , @xmath1 .",
    "they contain only fields which are present in the standard model and must be @xmath8 invariant .",
    "they are also required to conserve baryon number , otherwise the nonobservation of proton decays will constrain the scale @xmath5 to be greater than @xmath9 gev , in which case neutrino masses induced by operators with @xmath10 will be too small to be of interest . because limits on lepton flavor violating processes such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 constrain @xmath5 to be larger than a few tev , we shall focus on effective operators of dimension 11 and lower : operators of higher dimension will likely lead to neutrino masses that are too small to satisfy the atmospheric neutrino data which require at least one neutrino to have a mass of about 0.03 ev @xcite .",
