    "although a @xmath1-wave analog of the bcs - bec crossover has been predicted theoretically  @xcite and @xmath1-wave and higher partial - wave resonances have been observed experimentally  @xcite , @xmath1-wave superfluids have not been realized in cold - atom experiments so far .",

    "in this paper , we showed that a purely @xmath0-wave interaction in a free space can induce higher partial - wave resonances in mixed dimensions .",
    "we developed two - body scattering theories in all three cases of 0d-3d , 1d-3d , and 2d-3d mixtures , and determined the positions of higher partial - wave resonances in terms of the free - space scattering length , assuming a harmonic confinement potential .",
    "we also computed the low - energy scattering parameters in the @xmath1-wave channel ( effective scattering volume and momentum ) that are necessary for the low - energy effective theory of the @xmath1-wave resonance .",
    "potentially our study paves the way for a variety of physics , such as anderson localization of matter waves under @xmath1-wave resonant scatterers in the 0d-3d mixed dimensions  @xcite , shiba bound states in a superfluid medium  @xcite , and bose - einstein condensation of @xmath1-wave molecules in the 2d-3d mixed dimensions , provided that such molecules are long lived .    when both @xmath2 and @xmath3 atoms are fermionic ( such as for the @xmath289li-@xmath290k mixture  @xcite ) , inelastic three - body , atom - molecule , and molecule - molecule collisions decaying into deeply bound dimers whose size is set by the range of interatomic potential @xmath291 are suppressed .",
    "this is because at a short distance @xmath292 , the confinement potential is irrelevant , and in the @xmath0-wave interspecies interaction the pauli exclusion principle is effective to suppress the inelastic collisions decaying into the deeply bound dimers  @xcite .",
    "an order - of - magnitude estimate of such a three - body recombination rate can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for wide feshbach resonances and in ref .",
    "@xcite for narrow feshbach resonances",
    ".    therefore , for a fermi - fermi mixture in mixed dimensions , the relaxation of molecules is dominated by the decay into deeper molecular states of size @xmath293 if they exist . in the vicinity of the @xmath0-wave resonance at the smallest value of @xmath78 , indicated by thick curves in figs .",
    "[ fig : resonance_0d ] , [ fig : resonance_1d ] , and [ fig : resonance_2d ] , there is no such molecular state and thus associated @xmath0-wave molecules are long lived .",
    "however , in the vicinity of the higher partial - wave resonances , there is always at least one deeper molecular state .",
    "the inelastic atom - molecule and molecule - molecule collisions decaying into such molecular states are not generally suppressed , and thus @xmath1-wave or higher partial - wave molecules in mixed dimensions would be short lived .",
    "it is therefore an important future problem to investigate as to whether the inelastic collisions of @xmath1-wave molecules decaying into the lowest @xmath0-wave state of size @xmath293 could be suppressed , for example , by controlling the system parameters .",
    "we conclude this paper by discussing a simple analogy between a tower of our confinement - induced molecules and kaluza - klein modes in extra - dimension models  @xcite .",
    "suppose our 3d world has one compact extra dimension with an extent of @xmath294 .",
    "then the momentum of a 4d particle in the extra fourth direction is quantized as @xmath295 .",
    "because we live in 3d , such a particle can be viewed as a tower of `` new particles '' with the quantized masses @xmath296 .",
    "these new particles are called kaluza - klein modes and could be observed by colliding high - energy particles @xmath297 at the large hadron collider .    now in our case , for example , in the 2d-3d mixed dimensions , the motion of a 3d molecule in the `` extra '' @xmath18 direction is quantized as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx_2d ] ) because of the confinement potential .",
    "we can view such quantized energy levels as a tower of new `` feshbach molecules '' analogous to the kaluza - klein modes . unlike in extra - dimension models , our particle is a composite molecule and we can control its binding energy to shift the energies of the tower of new molecules .",
    "when each of them crosses the scattering threshold , the resonance occurs . a series of such resonances caused by the `` kaluza - klein '' tower of confinement - induced molecules has been investigated in this paper and observed in the cold - atom experiment  @xcite .",
