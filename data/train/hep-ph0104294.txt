    "recent results from the super - kamiokande collaboration @xcite involving atmospheric neutrinos have rather convincingly demonstrated the partial disappearance of muon - neutrinos and favor the oscillation of muon - neutrinos into tau - neutrinos , rather than into sterile neutrinos at the 99% confidence level . with regard to solar neutrinos ,",
    "the situation is somewhat more ambiguous . on the basis of the recently announced 1258 day sample results from super - kamiokande @xcite , together with the flux data from the chlorine @xcite and gallium @xcite experiments , the partial disappearance of electron - neutrinos through oscillations into the active flavors of muon- or tau - neutrinos",
    "is favored over oscillations into purely sterile neutrinos , with the large mixing angle ( lma ) solution strongly preferred over the small mixing angle ( sma ) , the low , and the quasi - vacuum ( qvo ) solutions .",
    "several recent analyses @xcite based on the smaller 1117 day sample are basically in agreement with this conclusion by super - kamiokande but assign slightly higher probabilities to the other three solutions than does ref .",
    "@xcite .    whereas the data at present prefer the lma solution to the solar neutrino problem , from a model building point of view the lma solution seems by far the most difficult solution to obtain @xcite .",
    "many published models of neutrino masses and mixings either can not obtain the lma solution , or can only obtain it by fine tuning parameters .",
    "it is thus of importance to reexamine various approaches to see whether they have sufficient flexibility to accomodate the lma solution in a natural way .",
    "one approach that is particularly flexible is the so - called  lopsided mass matrix \" approach .",
    "the idea here is that the large atmospheric neutrino mixing angle arises from the form of the _ charged lepton _ mass matrix . in other words , in this approach @xmath2 is more naturally thought of as a mixing of @xmath3 and @xmath4 rather than of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "the solar neutrino mixing can come from the _ neutrino _ mass matrix . in this way the atmospheric neutrino problem and the solar neutrino problem can be decoupled from each other .",
    "this is one feature that allows the lopsided mass matrix models to be more flexible in dealing with the solar neutrino problem . in this paper",
    "we study an especially simple but very predictive example of a lopsided mass matrix model to see whether it can accommodate the lma solution in a natural way , that is , without fine - tuning .",
    "the model we shall discuss was developed in a series of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite by the present authors , together with k.s .",
    "babu earlier in the collaboration . the model is based on supersymmetric @xmath0 grand unification . as is well known , @xmath0 symmetry typically relates the forms of the dirac mass matrices of the up quarks , down quarks , charged leptons and neutrinos ( which we denote by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , respectively ) very closely to each other . in this model , the lopsidedness of the charged lepton mass matrix , @xmath9 , and of the down quark",
    "mass matrix , @xmath8 , allow an elegant explanation of many of the features of the quark and lepton masses and mixings ; in particular , the fact that @xmath2 is large whereas @xmath11 is small .",
    "an interesting point is that in this model the largeness of the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath2 is forced upon one by the structure of @xmath9 , which in turn is tied by @xmath0 symmetry to the forms of the other dirac mass matrices . on the other hand , as is again typical of @xmath0 unification , the majorana mass matrix of the right - handed neutrinos , @xmath1 , is only indirectly related to the dirac matrices , and is therefore much less constrained . this allows various possibilities for solar neutrino mixing .    in the first papers describing this model @xcite , it was found that the sma solution is very easily obtained if one assumes certain simple forms for @xmath1 , specifically ones which have zeros in the 12 , 13 , 21 and 31 elements .",
    "later it was realized that the qvo solution is also easily obtained @xcite by assuming certain other simple forms for @xmath1 .",
    "however , it was found that the simplest looking forms for @xmath1 , namely those with many texture zeros , can not give the lma solution @xcite . in light of the recent claim that the lma solution is strongly favored ,",
    "we re - examine this model to see whether the lma can be obtained in a natural way .",
    "in fact , we look at all four solar solutions .    in sect .",
    "ii we specify the conditions for each of the four solar solutions .",
    "the dirac mass matrices and parameters obtained earlier for the @xmath0 model in question are presented in sect .",
    "iii , where we also numerically determine the structures of the right - handed majorana matrix needed to reproduce all four solutions .",
    "a survey of these numerical results in sect .",
    "iv reveals that @xmath1 for the lma solution , in particular , has a remarkably simple texture which can be easily related to the dirac neutrino matrix .",
    "for this case , the seesaw mechanism then leads to a light neutrino mass matrix which has two or three texture zeros .",
    "the implications of this solution for leptogenesis are briefly discussed .",
    "here we summarize the preferred points in the neutrino mixing plane for the atmospheric neutrino and the four viable solar neutrino oscillation solutions .",

    "we will only mention a few of the features of the model important for the present considerations .",
    "this model arose from an attempt to construct a realistic @xmath0 model with the simplest possible , or  minimal , \" higgs content .",
    "this attempt led very naturally to the following structures at the gut scale for the dirac mass matrices of the up quarks , down quarks , neutrinos , and charged leptons , labeled @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath10 , and @xmath9 , respectively : @xmath28 a crucial point is that the four dirac matrices are closely related to each other by the group theory of @xmath0 and that their forms are definitely fixed in terms of a few parameters . as a result",
    "the model is very predictive , and in fact gives excellent agreement with all the known facts about the ckm mixings , the quark masses , and the charged lepton masses . by fitting these data , taking into account the renormalization effects from the gut scale to low energies ,",
    "the following values of the parameters were obtained : @xmath29    a critical feature of the model is that the parameter @xmath30 is of order unity , and appears in an asymmetrical or  lopsided \" way in @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "this fact plays many roles in the model and is indeed the key to its economy and success in fitting the data .",
    "it explains ( a ) why @xmath31 , since @xmath32 , while @xmath33 ; ( b ) why the georgi - jarlskog relation @xmath34 holds , since without the @xmath30 term a factor of @xmath35 rather than @xmath36 would result ; and ( c ) why @xmath37 .",
    "the reason for the last is that @xmath30 appears in the 32 element of @xmath9 , where it causes a large mixing of left - handed muon and tau leptons , i.e. large @xmath2 , whereas it appears in the 23 element of @xmath8 , where it causes a large mixing of right - handed quarks , which is not relevant to @xmath11 .",
    "the mixing @xmath11 is instead controlled by the 32 element of @xmath8 , which is the small parameter @xmath38 .",
    "the fact that @xmath30 appears transposed between @xmath8 and @xmath9 has to do with the @xmath39 structure of the fields involved .    for present purposes the most important fact is that the largeness of the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle comes from the parameter @xmath30 in the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath9 .",
    "the contribution of the neutrino mass matrix to this mixing is formally of order @xmath40 , as can be seen from the form of @xmath10 , and is therefore numerically small for generic choices of @xmath1 . on the other hand",
    ", one sees that the solar neutrino mixing angle receives only a small contribution from the charged lepton sector , since the 12 and 21 elements of @xmath9 are small .",
    "therefore , whether the solar angle is large or small is controlled by the neutrino mass matrix @xmath41 , or in other words by @xmath1 , since @xmath10 is fixed .",
    "the form of @xmath1 is rather independent of the forms of the dirac matrices given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmatrices ] ) because it comes from completely different operators .",
    "that is why in this model  and indeed in the general framework @xcite of  lopsided mass matrix models \" in which the atmospheric angle arises from large lopsided entries in @xmath9  there is great flexibility in how the solar neutrino problem is solved .",
    "different solar oscillation solutions can be obtained by changing the form of @xmath1 without affecting in any way the fits to the ckm parameters , the masses of the quarks and charged leptons , or the fact that the atmospheric neutrino angle is large .    in our first papers where this model was discussed , forms of @xmath1",
    "were assumed in which the sma solar solution was naturally obtained .",
    "indeed , one sees immediately that if @xmath1 has vanishing 12 , 21 , 13 , and 31 elements , @xmath42 does not contribute to the solar neutrino angle , which then comes entirely from @xmath9 and is therefore small .",

    "it is noteworthy that the solar neutrino mixing is near maximal , but not actually maximal as that is presently excluded experimentally by the superkamiokande results at more than the 95% confidence level .",
    "how fine - tuned is the form of @xmath1 that we have been discussing ?",
    "one feature that at least appears fine - tuned is the fact that the 23 and 32 entries in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mrapprox ] ) are not only of order @xmath40 but actually equal to @xmath103 exactly .",
    "this one has no right to expect from the mere fact that the same vevs come into the diagrams for @xmath10 and @xmath1 , since as can be seen from figs .",
    "1 and 2 different yukawa couplings are involved in the 23 entries of the two matrices .",
    "one can test how fine - tuned the form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mrapprox ] ) is by replacing the 23 and 32 elements by @xmath104 and the 22 element by @xmath105 .",
    "( the fact that the same @xmath106 enters is due to the factorized structure of the diagrams in fig . 2 , and is therefore not a fine - tuning .",
    ") one naturally expects that @xmath106 is of order unity , but how close must it be to 1 to give a realistic lma solution ?",
    "it turns out that the most severe constraint on the value of @xmath106 comes from the limit on @xmath107 . to satisfy the condition that @xmath108 @xcite , one requires that @xmath109 .",
    "thus , the lma solution does not require an unnatural fine - tuning of parameters .",
    "finally we note that the upper bound on the lightest heavy majorana neutrino mass @xmath110 should be less than or of order @xmath111 gev to prevent overproduction of gravitinos from overclosing the universe after inflation @xcite .",
    "this bound is satisfied for all four solar solutions as determined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mrnumer ] ) and , in particular , for the model illustrated above .",
    "a second condition for leptogenesis is that the 13 and 31 elements of @xmath1 be suppressed by a factor of at least @xmath112 relative to the 33 element to inhibit mixing of the heaviest right - handed neutrino with the lightest one in order to prevent its rapid decay washing out the lepton asymmetry generated .",
    "this is satisfied in our model .",
    "we have investigated how an @xmath0 susy gut model proposed earlier can be modified in order to obtain solar neutrino solutions other than the vacuum solution .",
    "the study revealed that only the right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix needed to be modified , with the dirac matrices for the neutrinos and charged leptons ( as well as for the quarks ) left unchanged . in short , in this model the maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing is controlled primarily by the structure of the charged lepton mass matrix , while the type of solar neutrino solution is largely determined by the form of the right - handed majorana mass matrix .",
    "of particular interest was the finding that the large mixing angle solar solution is readily obtained with a nearly geometrical hierarchy in @xmath1 , where the 2 - 3 subsector has a close relationship with that for the dirac neutrino matrix , as seen by study of the froggatt - nielsen diagrams .",
    "it is precisely this structure which provides the `` fine - tuning '' necessary to achieve the lma solar solution . + the research of smb",
