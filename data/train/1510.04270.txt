    "clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally - collapsed structures in the universe .",
    "studying properties such as the number density of clusters and details of their growth from the highest density perturbations in the early universe , offers insight into the underlying cosmology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the study of galaxy clusters has been transformed with the launch of powerful x - ray telescopes such as _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ , which have allowed the study of the x - ray emitting intracluster medium ( icm ) with unprecedented detail and accuracy .",
    "cluster properties have been used widely in the determination of cosmological parameters .",
    "cosmological studies utilising clusters include investigating the cluster temperature function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , scaling relations used as a mass proxy such as the luminosity - mass ( e.g * ? ? ? * ) and the temperature - mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) relations , using the gas mass fraction , f@xmath6 @xcite , and the cluster mass function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to place constraints on various cosmological parameters . since one of the most important ingredients of these cosmological studies is the cluster mass , large efforts have been undertaken to accurately determine this quantity .",
    "one such method involves the construction of radial temperature and gas density profiles of the icm , and under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium , the cluster mass can be determined .",
    "observations using x - rays have become a well established method of estimating cluster masses , and , at the present time , arguably the most reliable .",
    "however , constructing temperature profiles for individual clusters for use in a hydrostatic mass analysis generally require long telescope exposure times , and not is not feasible for large samples of clusters . therefore , deriving well calibrated scaling relations between simple cluster observables and mass is of crucial importance for using clusters as cosmological probes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath7 ) is one of the easiest cluster properties to obtain , and has had a rich history in its scaling with mass ( @xmath8 ) . under the assumption of self - similarity @xcite , the @xmath2 relation ( throughout this work we use the notation @xmath2 when generally discussing the luminosity - mass relation ) is expected to follow a relationship of @xmath9 .",
    "however , observational studies of the @xmath2 relation have found a slope steeper than the self - similar expectation , @xmath32 .",
    "the most widely accepted theory for the steep slope of the @xmath2 relation , is due to heating from sources such as supernovae ( sne ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "this causes gas to be expelled from the inner region , hence suppressing the luminosity .",
    "this effect should be larger in lower mass systems due to the shallower potential well , which therefore causes the observed steepening of the @xmath2 relation .",
    "a complication of measuring the @xmath2 relation is that the cluster samples used are traditionally x - ray selected , with x - ray flux limited samples suffering from two forms of selection bias , malmquist bias , where higher luminosity clusters are detectable out to higher redshifts and so occupy a larger survey volume , and eddington bias , where in the presence of intrinsic or statistical scatter in luminosity for a given mass , objects above a flux limit will have above - average luminosities for their mass . due to the steep slope of the cluster mass function ,",
    "the eddington bias is amplified , resulting in a net movement of lower mass objects into a flux limited sample . the consequence of biases on the observed @xmath2 relation is to bias the normalisation high and the slope low .",
    "therefore , taking these biases into account is paramount when modeling cluster scaling relations , in order to uncover the true nature of any non - gravitational heating which drives departures from self - similar behavior with mass or redshift .",
    "although scaling relation studies have had a rich history , at the present time only a small number of published relations attempt to account for selection biases , while @xcite provides the most robust handling of selection effects to date .",
    "deriving cluster masses through x - ray observations with the assumption that the icm is in hydrostatic equilibrium , is not always valid , as some clusters have complex temperature structures due to processes such as merger events .",
    "this assumption is thought to be closely satisfied by clusters that are dynamically relaxed .",
    "clusters that appear to host a cool core ( cc ) are frequently used for mass derivations as they are believed to be dynamically relaxed .",
    "many methods are used to infer the presence of a cc , including measuring the central temperature drop ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the central cooling time , the core entropy ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the cuspiness of the gas density profile @xcite .",
    "frequently , scaling relations involving the cluster mass are used as a mass proxy to calculate the masses of large cluster samples .",
    "this first requires constructing scaling relations for dynamically relaxed clusters , and then inferring the cluster masses from these relations .",
    "it has been found however that using cc clusters sometimes results in larger scatter of the @xmath2 scaling relation compared to non - cool core ( ncc ) clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite found that by defining a cluster sub - sample using clusters appearing both dynamically relaxed and hosting a cool core , the luminosity - temperature ( @xmath10 ) relation appears self - similar , compared to unrelaxed and non - cool core clusters .",
    "while this method may be the preferred choice for defining sub - samples of clusters for mass derivations , this limits the cluster sample size used for mass calculations .",
    "this paper aims to measure the masses for a complete sample of 35 clusters to measure the x - ray observable  mass scaling relations .",
    "we aim to define a sub - sample of clusters that are both dynamically relaxed and host a cc for which the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is valid and accurate x - ray masses can be obtained . by constructing scaling relations between x - ray observables and mass for this sub - sample of clusters , these will be used as a mass proxy for the remaining clusters .",
