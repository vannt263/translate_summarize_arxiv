    "non - conforming finite element methods ( fems ) play an important role in computational mechanics .",
    "they allow the discretization of partial differential equations ( pdes ) for incompressible fluid flows , for almost incompressible materials in linear elasticity , and for low polynomial degrees in the ansatz spaces for higher - order problems .",
    "the projection property of the interpolation operator of the @xmath0 non - conforming fem , also named after crouzeix and raviart  @xcite , states that the @xmath1  projection of @xmath2 onto the space of piecewise constant functions equals the space of piecewise gradients of the non - conforming interpolation of @xmath3  functions in the @xmath0 non - conforming finite element space .",
    "this property is the basis for the proof of the discrete inf - sup condition for the stokes equations  @xcite as well as for the analysis of adaptive algorithms  @xcite .",
    "many possible generalizations of the @xmath0 non - conforming fem to higher polynomial degrees have been proposed .",
    "all those generalizations are either based on a modification of the classical concept of degrees of freedom @xcite , are restricted to odd polynomial degrees @xcite , or employ an enrichment by additional bubble - functions @xcite .",
    "however , none of those generalizations possesses a corresponding projection property of the interpolation operator for higher moments ( see remark  [ r : pmpnoteqcr ] below ) .",
    "this paper introduces a novel formulation of the poisson equation ( in   below ) based on the helmholtz decomposition along with its discretization of arbitrary ( globally fixed ) polynomial degree .",
    "this new discretization approximates directly the gradient of the solution , which is often the quantity of interest , instead of the solution itself .",
    "for the lowest - order polynomial degree , the discrete helmholtz decomposition of @xcite proves equivalence of the novel discretization with the known non - conforming crouzeix - raviart fem @xcite and therefore they appear in a natural hierarchy . in the context of the novel ( mixed ) formulation ,",
    "these discretizations turn out to be conforming .",
    "although the complexity of the new discretization itself is competitive with that of a standard fem , the method requires the pre - computation of some function @xmath4 such that its divergence equals the right - hand side .",
    "if this is not computable analytically , this results in an additional integration ( see also remark  [ r : computationphi ] below ) . however , this paper focuses on the poisson problem as a model problem to introduce the idea of the new approach and to give a broad impression over possible extensions as quadrilateral discretizations ( including a discrete helmholtz decomposition on quadrilateral meshes for the non - conforming rannacher - turek fem  @xcite as a further highlight of this paper ) , the generalization to three dimensions , or inhomogeneous mixed boundary conditions .",
    "the advantages of the new approach in some applications will be the topic of forthcoming papers  @xcite .",
    "the presence of singularities for non - convex domains usually yields the same sub - optimal convergence rate for any polynomial degree .",
    "this motivates adaptive mesh - generation strategies , which recover the optimal convergence rates .",
    "this paper presents an adaptive algorithm and proves its optimal convergence .",
    "the proof essentially follows ideas from the context of the non - conforming crouzeix - raviart fem @xcite .",
    "this illustrates that the novel discretization generalizes it in a natural way .",
    "since the efficient and reliable error estimator involves a data approximation term without a multiplicative power of the mesh - size , the adaptive algorithm is based on separate marking .",
    "a possible drawback of the new fems is that the gradient of the solution @xmath5 is approximated , but not the solution @xmath6 itself .",

    "<S> this paper generalizes the non - conforming fem of crouzeix and raviart and its fundamental projection property by a novel mixed formulation for the poisson problem based on the helmholtz decomposition . </S>",
    "<S> the new formulation allows for ansatz spaces of arbitrary polynomial degree and its discretization coincides with the mentioned non - conforming fem for the lowest polynomial degree . </S>",
    "<S> the discretization directly approximates the gradient of the solution instead of the solution itself . </S>",
    "<S> besides the a  priori and medius analysis , this paper proves optimal convergence rates for an adaptive algorithm for the new discretization . </S>",
    "<S> these are also demonstrated in numerical experiments . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this paper focuses on extensions of this new scheme to quadrilateral meshes , mixed fems , and three space dimensions .    </S>",
