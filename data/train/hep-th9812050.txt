    "the theoretical basis of nprg was formulated by k.g.wilson in 1970s.@xcite after that , several types of ` exact ' renormalization group equations were derived and have been applied to various quantum systems . although those equations are exact , we can not solve them without any approximation in practice .",
    "therefore it is not trivial that such nprg analysis can take account of the effects caused by non - perturbative dynamics even qualitatively .",
    "generally , there are two types of non - perturbative quantities .",
    "one corresponds to summation of all orders of the perturbative series , which might be related to the borel resummation.@xcite the other is the essential singularity with respect to coupling constant @xmath0 , which has a structure like @xmath1.@xcite we are not able to expand this singular contribution around the origin of @xmath0 .",
    "this singularity is essential in case of quantum tunnelling .",
    "for example , in the symmetric double well system , there are degenerated two energy levels at each minima , which are mixed through tunnelling to generate an energy gap @xmath2 .",
    "the exponential factor comes from the free energy of topological configurations , the instantons .",
    "can nprg evaluate these non - perturbative effects in a good manner ?",
    "the main purpose of our work is to check this not only qualitatively but also quantitatively .",
    "we carry it out in quantum mechanical systems by comparing our results with the exact values given by numerical analysis of the schrdinger equation , with the perturbative series , and with the instanton method .",
    "the instanton method is a unique analysis of quantum tunnelling leading to the exact essential singularity , which is , however , valid only in a very weak coupling region .",
    "it will turn out that the instanton method and lpa w - h eqn .",
    "are somehow complementary to each other .",
    "though quantum tunnelling is one of the most striking consequences of quantum theories , there has been no general - purpose tool to analyze it .",
    "so if nprg treats non - perturbative dynamics well , it can be a powerful new tool for analysis of tunnelling and this work will be the first touch to attack more complex systems with quantum tunnelling by nprg .",
    "as a primary study , we would like to restrict ourselves to treat the effective potential .",
    "we start with the lpa w - h eqn . for scalar theories , where we ignore the corrections to the derivative interactions,@xcite @xmath3\\hat{v}_{\\rm eff}+{a_d \\over 2 }    \\log{\\left ( 1+{{\\partial^2 \\hat{v}_{\\rm eff } \\over \\partial \\hat{\\varphi } \\partial \\hat{\\varphi } } } \\right ) } .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each hatted(@xmath4 ) variable represents a dimensionless quantity with a unit defined by the momentum cut off @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the space - time dimension , @xmath7 is the canonical dimension of scalar field @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "this is a partial differential equation of the dimensionless effective potential @xmath10 with respect to @xmath11 and scale parameter @xmath12 .",
    "making use of these equations , we can analyze quantum mechanics , which is @xmath6=1 real scalar theory with a dynamical variable @xmath21 .",
    "we now evaluate two physical quantities , the vacuum energy @xmath22 and the energy gap @xmath23 .",
    "the vacuum energy is given by , @xmath24 namely , the minimum value of @xmath13 gives us the ground energy of the system .",
    "the energy gap is obtained through the two point correlation function , @xmath25 while it is evaluated in the lpa as follows , @xmath26 where the effective mass @xmath27 is the curvature at the potential minimum .",
    "comparing the damping factor as @xmath28 goes to infinity , the relation @xmath29 follows and we use , @xmath30 thus we know the energy spectrum from the information of effective potential .    to show the fundamental procedure of analysis",
    ", we consider the case of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "we evaluate the effective potential @xmath13 by solving the differential equations for dimensionless couplings as follows ,    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33 +    [ cols= \" < \" , ]     @xmath34 + @xmath35    @xmath36 +    in this case , we can carry out the above procedure analytically , @xmath37^{\\hat{p}=\\frac{\\lambda_0}{\\sqrt{a_2(\\lambda_0)}}}_{\\hat{p}=\\frac{\\lambda_{\\rm f}}{\\sqrt{a_2(\\lambda_0 ) } } } , \\\\ a_2(\\lambda _ {",
    "\\rm f})\\!\\!&=&\\!\\!a_2(\\lambda_0 ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we take initial conditions @xmath38 , then we get @xmath39 in the limit @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "that is , we can evaluate the zero - point energy @xmath42 as a result of running of @xmath20 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath20 freezes where the cut off scale becomes less than the mass scale .",
    "the renormalization group flows are plotted in fig.[fig : hrun ] and fig.[fig : hflow ] .",
    "we see that the momentum region where the quantum corrections are effective is finite and depends on the mass .",
    "it is the decoupling property , which enables us to get effective couplings as physical quantities even by numerical calculation within a finite momentum region .",
    "now we proceed to analyze quantum mechanics of anharmonic oscillators . at first , we consider a symmetric single - well potential , @xmath43 of course , there is no tunnelling , so our interest is to compare our nprg results with the perturbative series .",
    "the corrected @xmath13 is shown in fig.[fig : spote ] and we obtain the energy spectrum as in fig.[fig : sspe ] .",
    "the perturbative series of @xmath44 are the asymptotic series , @xmath45+\\frac{3}{4}\\lambda_0 [ 2n^2 + 2n+1 ] -\\frac{1}{8}\\lambda_0 ^2 [ 34n^3 + 51n^2 + 59n+21]+\\cdots , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and shows diverging nature even in the weak coupling region .",
    "note that the borel resummation of the perturbative series works fine in this case and gives quantitatively good values . on the other hand , even in the lowest order approximation",
    ", w - h equation can evaluate the energy spectrum almost perfectly .",
    "therefore , nprg could treat all orders of the perturbative series in a correct manner .",
    "next , we consider a symmetric double - well potential , @xmath46 in this case , there is no well - defined perturbation theory . a standard technique to get the energy gap @xmath47 is the dilute gas instanton calculation which gives a result with the essential singularity , @xmath48 in nprg evolution of the effective potential , the initial double - well potential finally becomes a single well and the energy gap ( mass ) arises ( fig.[fig : dpote ] ) .",
    "this evolution is readily understandable considering that in one space - time dimension the @xmath49 symmetry does not break down due to the barrier penetration , i.e. the quantum tunnelling .",
    "the nprg results are very good in the strong coupling region , where we have no other method to compete ( fig.[fig : dspe ] ) .",
    "the perturbation can not be applied in this double - well system and the dilute gas instanton does not work at all , which is valid only in the very weak coupling region . therefore nprg method can be a powerful tool for analysis of tunnelling at least in such region . however , our nprg results deviate from exact values as @xmath50 , which corresponds to a very deep well . because the @xmath18-function becomes singular in this region , nprg results become unreliable .",
    "we consider that the cause of difficulty comes from the approximation scheme that we now adopt .",
    "after all , the coupling regions where lpa w - h eqn . and the dilute gas instanton are valid respectively are separated completely .",
    "there is only a cross over region . in this sense , these two methods are complementary to each other .",
    "concerning the reliability of the results , we have to check the truncation dependence of physical quantities . in a single - well case ( fig.[fig : strun ] ) , the results converge extremely well , but in a double - well case , as @xmath51 goes smaller ( fig.[fig : dtrun ] ) , the convergence becomes unclear .",
    "so in the small @xmath51 region , the effective couplings at even @xmath52 are not suitable for physical quantities .",
    "we should always pay attention to the convergence with respect to @xmath15.@xcite",
    "now we analyze this system by our nprg method .",
    "we calculate the effective potentials for a wide range of parameter @xmath65 .",
    "the case of vanishing @xmath65 corresponds to the harmonic oscillator and susy does not break there . on the other hand ,",
    "susy is dynamically broken at any non - vanishing @xmath65 .",
    "note that at small @xmath65 the bare potential is an asymmetric double - well , while at @xmath66{\\frac{1}{108}}\\simeq 0.31 $ ] it is a single - well and quantum tunnelling is irrelevant there ( fig.[fig : bpote ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : epote ] shows the result for @xmath65=0.24 , where the effective potential evolves into a convex one and its minimum turns out to be positive .",
    "that is , our nprg method gives positive @xmath22 correctly and realizes the dynamical susy breaking .    as is shown in fig.[fig : rspe ] , nprg results are excellent in the strong coupling region , but not in the region where the bare double - well potential becomes deep . in this region ( @xmath67 )",
    ", we can not show any result because of large numerical errors , while the valley instanton method works very well as shown in fig.[fig : vspe ] .",
    "the valley instanton is generalization of the instanton method based on the valley structure of the configuration space.@xcite again , two methods are somehow complementary to each other .",
    "the nprg method , even in lpa , can evaluate the non - perturbative quantities of the summation of all orders of the perturbative series in a quantitatively good manner .",
    "as for the non - perturbative quantities characterized by the essential singularity , lpa w - h eqn . also works very well in the region where the instanton and the perturbation break down , i.e. the strong coupling region .",
    "however nprg is not so effective in the weak coupling region because of large numerical errors . to summarize , lpa w - h eqn . and",
    "the ( valley ) instanton play complementary roles to each other .",
    "we do nt know the clear origin of difficulty which we encounter in our nprg analysis .",
    "we suspect that the derivative expansion does not fit in such a parameter region .",
    "anyway , we have to search for ` better ' approximations .    on the other hand , from a practical point of view , nprg method can be a good new tool for analysis of quantum tunnelling at least in some parameter region .",
    "for this purpose , we also need to study in detail how to extract tunnelling physics from the effective potential and the effective action .",
    "those techniques may be applied to models in quantum field theories@xcite and in more complex systems .",
    "especially quantum tunnelling with multi - degrees of freedom represented by dissipation@xcite is a very interesting subject to be attacked by nprg method .",
