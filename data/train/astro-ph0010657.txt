    "a keystone of the current paradigm of rotational evolution among low - mass pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars is the regulation of stellar angular momentum by circumstellar disks .",
    "indeed , most rotational evolution models today rely chiefly upon some form of disk - regulated stellar angular momentum to connect the rotational properties of t tauri stars ( tts ) to those of zero - age main sequence ( zams ) stars @xcite .",
    "the theoretical edifice supporting the disk - regulation paradigm has been developed by several researchers @xcite , wherein a steady - state , magnetically mediated , star - disk coupling mechanism keeps the star at roughly constant angular velocity for the lifetime of the disk , preventing the star from spinning up as it contracts .",
    "this magnetic disk - locking model provides an attractive solution to the long - standing puzzle of how stars deplete angular momentum as they evolve to the main sequence @xcite .",
    "observational investigations of disk - regulated angular momentum have yielded mixed results . in support of disk - locking ,",
    "several authors have , either directly or indirectly , linked disks to slow stellar rotation .",
    "for example , herbst and collaborators ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) have reported the distribution of tts rotation periods in the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) to be distinctly bimodal . the slow rotators ( @xmath1 days ) , they suggest , represent those stars that are presently , or were until recently , disk - locked . more direct support has been presented by @xcite , who reported a correlation between the presence of excess near - ir emission and slow stellar rotation among 34 tts in taurus and orion .",
    "considering stars in their sample later than k5 , those authors found excess near - ir emission among none of the rapid rotators but among half of the slow rotators .",
    "@xcite reported similar results among 26 tts in taurus - auriga .",
    "they found that the classical tts ( ctts ; those showing evidence of active accretion and circumstellar disks ) in their sample rotate more slowly on average than their weak - lined ( wtts ) counterparts .",
    "in contrast to these studies , we did not find strong evidence for a bimodal distribution of rotation periods , nor did we find evidence for a linkage between disks and slow stellar rotation , in our own study of disks and stellar rotation in orion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ; see also stassun et al .",
    "2000 for a concise summary ) . among 254 stars with @xmath2 days , we found the distribution of rotation periods to be statistically consistent with a uniform distribution .",
    "moreover , we found near - ir excesses to be present with roughly equal frequency among both slow and rapid rotators when we combined our rotation periods with near - ir photometry from the literature @xcite for more than 100 stars in our sample .",
    "@xcite have shown that subdividing the onc sample by mass can reconcile some of these contradictory findings .",
    "they find that the bimodal distribution of rotation periods in orion holds true when they consider only stars with @xmath3 , i.e.  earlier than about m3 .",
    "for these stars , they also find a weak but statistically significant correlation between near - ir excess and stellar rotation period ; the slower rotators tend to exhibit larger near - ir excesses .",
    "whether these ir observations of tts in fact agree with the predictions of disk - locking models is an important question that has yet to be fully explored .",
    "while the various prescriptions for magnetic star - disk coupling differ in detail , a key prediction of the models is that the stellar magnetosphere will truncate the disk at an inner radius , @xmath4 , that is very nearly equal to the co - rotation radius , @xmath5 ( the distance from the star at which disk material rotates with keplerian angular velocity equal to the stellar angular velocity ) .",
    "consequently , stars with @xmath6 ( i.e. slow rotators ) should have @xmath7 , and so are _ not _ expected to show their disks at near - ir wavelengths ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "ironically , while previous authors have upheld the disk - locking hypothesis by linking slow stellar rotation to the presence of excess near - ir emission , it is the slow rotators that _ lack _ near - ir excesses that may be most consistent with the disk - locking scenario . an important question , therefore , is whether slow rotators lacking near - ir excesses indeed possess truncated disks , or if they are simply diskless .",
    "a similar question applies with respect to _ rapid _ stellar rotation as well .",
    "we reported in paper  i the existence of very rapidly rotating ( @xmath8 days ) tts in the onc , some with rotation periods corresponding to breakup velocity .",
    "roughly one - third of the rapid rotators in the onc do not evince excess emission in the near - ir , indicating that they do not possess inner disks .",
    "what is to be the rotational fate of these apparently diskless pms ultra - fast rotators , and what implications do they carry for rotational evolution models ? at @xmath9 myr @xcite ,",
    "these stars still face contraction in size by factors of 510 , yet _ already rotate at or near breakup velocity_. if these stars are truly diskless as the near - ir data suggest , then they must shed most of their angular momentum prior to the main sequence without the aid of disk - locking .",
    "in this paper we present new mid - ir ( primarily @xmath10-band ) photometry for a sample of low - mass tts in the onc and in taurus - auriga for which rotation periods have been determined and which do not show excess emission in the near - ir .",
    "we supplement these new data with existing data from the literature to form a sample of 32 stars , roughly evenly divided between slow ( @xmath1 days ) and rapid rotators .",
    "our aim is two - fold : first , we wish to determine whether slow rotators lacking near - ir excesses possess truncated disks , consistent with disk - locking models , or if these stars are simply diskless .",
    "second , we wish to determine whether _ rapid _ rotators lacking near - ir excesses are in fact diskless , or if they possess truncated disks to which they may be coupled in a non - steady - state and which may influence their subsequent rotational evolution .    the data , and the methods we employ in their analysis , are described in  2 .",
    "the results of our search for truncated disks are presented in  3 .",
    "we find evidence for excess mid - ir emission among only three of the stars in our sample .",
    "these stars may possess disks with @xmath11 , consistent with disk - locking models .",
    "no disks are evident at mid - ir wavelengths among the remaining 29 stars in our sample ; these stars are evidently diskless .",
    "it thus appears that many stars can exist as slow rotators at 1 myr without the aid of present disk - locking .",
    "in addition , there exist very young stars already rotating near breakup velocity whose subsequent angular momentum evolution will not be regulated by disks . in ",
    "4 we discuss the implications of these results both for the hypothesis of disk - regulated angular momentum and for rotational evolution models of low - mass pms stars .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  5 .",
    "our goal is to search for truncated circumstellar disks among tts with known rotation periods but without evidence for disks in the near - ir . to do this",
    ", we wish to search for the presence of  excess \" flux ( emission above photospheric ) at mid - ir wavelengths and to compare the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of each star to a model sed of a star with a truncated disk .",
    "thus , we formed the sample for this study by selecting pms stars in the onc and taurus - auriga star - forming regions that satisfy the following criteria : ( 1 ) known rotation periods , ( 2 ) near - ir ( i.e.  @xmath12 ) colors consistent with photospheric values , and ( 3 ) basic stellar data available ( e.g.  effective temperatures , radii , luminosities , extinctions ) for computing model seds .",
    "onc rotation periods were taken from @xcite and paper  i , while taurus - auriga rotation periods were taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we identified stars lacking in near - ir excess emission on the basis of the near - ir excess - emission diagnostics determined by @xcite and @xcite for stars in the onc , and by @xcite and @xcite for stars in taurus - auriga . following the criteria discussed in those papers , we selected only sources with either @xmath13 mag @xcite , @xmath14 mag @xcite , or @xmath15 dex @xcite .",
    "we consider only stars with derived masses of @xmath3 , as @xcite have recently suggested that this is the stellar mass above which rotational and infrared signatures of disk - locking are observable at @xmath16 myr .    here",
    "we describe the near- and mid - ir photometry newly obtained by us , as well as the visible to mid - ir data from the literature , that we combine to form observed seds .",
    "we then briefly describe the method we employ to generate model seds .",
    "we compare the observed and model seds in the following section .",
    "forty onc stars met the criteria for selection discussed above , none of which have mid - ir photometry in the literature .",
    "we selected onc targets for our mid - ir observations primarily on the basis of rotation period , attempting to observe an equal number of rapid and slow rotators .",
    "we also gave some preference to brighter stars , thereby minimizing exposure times and maximizing the number of targets we could observe .",
    "twenty - three taurus - auriga stars met the selection criteria , and of these only eight do not already have mid - ir photometry available in the literature .",
    "we selected tau - aur targets for our mid - ir observations entirely on the basis of rotation period .",
    "we obtained new @xmath10-band ( 10.8 @xmath0 m ) photometry of 11 tts in the onc and 5 tts in taurus - auriga using the oscir instrumentm , built at the university of florida under the direction of charles telesco .",

    "we used a standard chop - nod observing mode , with a chop frequency of 5 hz and throw of 23n - s .",
    "in addition , for 2 tts in the onc ( one of which was included in the @xmath10-band observations ) , we obtained photometry in the @xmath19 ( 3.8 @xmath0 m ) and @xmath20 ( 4.8 @xmath0 m filter ( @xmath21 @xmath0 m , @xmath22 @xmath0 m ) .",

    "such a disk has the _ minimum _ luminosity possible for an optically thick disk ; the disk can not be less luminous unless it becomes optically thin .",
    "thus , if the observed emission from a star at a given wavelength falls below this model , the implication is that the disk is absent ( or at least optically thin ) in the regions that dominate the disk emission at that wavelength .",

    "we note that two stars in our sample ( and ) show weak evidence for active accretion in the form of marginally detected triplet emission @xcite , but the newly determined seds for these stars ( fig .",
    "[ oncsedfig ] ) fairly conclusively rule out the existence of ( optically thick ) inner disk material .    to emphasize the extent to which the onc stars in our sample are lacking in inner disk material , we show in figure [ bigholefig ] the effect of increasing @xmath4 beyond @xmath5 for the star , which is a  typical \" onc slow rotator with @xmath55 days and @xmath56 ( @xmath57 au ) .",
    "the figure clearly illustrates that , even though the model sed assumes the minimum disk luminosity possible , an extremely large inner disk hole ( @xmath58 au ) is required to eliminate the disk flux at @xmath10 .",

    ", we find that 29/32 tts lacking near - ir excess - emission signatures of disks show seds consistent with being purely photospheric for @xmath60 @xmath0 m ( and in some cases for @xmath61 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the general tendency for these stars to exhibit only photospheric - level @xmath10-band fluxes indicates the absence of disk material at ( and , indeed ,",
    "well beyond ) @xmath5 ; disks are not presently in a position to regulate the rotation of these stars .",
    "in the previous section we used new and existing mid - ir photometry to search for truncated disks among 32 tts known to lack excess emission at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "the basic result of this study is that , with a few possible exceptions , the young pms stars that comprise our sample  both rapid and slow rotators ",
    "lack circumstellar disks that might act to regulate their rotation . in this section ,",
    "we consider the implications of this result for the general question of the role that disks play in the regulation of stellar rotation among low - mass pms stars .",
    "we begin by comparing our findings with those of previous studies that have linked the presence of disks to slow rotation in tts .",
    "next , we discuss the implications of our results for rotational evolution models of low - mass pms stars . finally , we consider the extent to which our observations and those of other authors agree with the predictions of magnetic disk - locking models .      as one of the pillars supporting the idea of disk - regulated stellar angular momentum ,",
    "several authors have linked slow stellar rotation to ir signatures of disks @xcite . within this context , slowly rotating tts ( @xmath1 days )",
    "are understood in terms of magnetic locking to disks , while rapidly rotating tts ( @xmath41 days ) are interpreted as stars that were disk - locked in an earlier epoch , but that have spun up after having lost their disks .",
    "though slow and rapid rotators in the onc and in taurus - auriga in fact appear roughly coeval in terms of their placement in the h - r diagram @xcite , this separation of tts into slow rotators with disks and rapid rotators without disks has resulted in slowly and rapidly rotating tts being seen in terms of an _ evolutionary sequence _ , one in which rapid rotators _ derive from _ slow rotators .",
    "consequently , slow rotators have come to define the  initial conditions \" assumed by most pms rotational evolution models @xcite ; rapidly rotating tts have in general not been considered as part of the initial conditions for the models .    however , while the @xcite study found no instances of rapidly rotating tts with significant near - ir signatures of disks , more recent studies have in fact found disked rapid rotators , making the connection between disks and slow rotators less distinct .",
    "for example , @xcite found significant excess near - ir emission among two of the five rapid rotators in their study of the trapezium . in our recent study of the onc",
    "( paper  i ) , involving a considerably larger sample , we found roughly equal numbers of rapid rotators with and without strong near - ir excesses ; and the same is true of the similarly sized onc sample considered by @xcite .",
    "we also found in paper  i that strong h@xmath62 emission , indicative of active disk accretion , is present in rapid rotators with roughly equal frequency to the slow rotators in our sample .",
    "thus , it now seems that there exist large numbers of rapidly rotating tts with circumstellar disks .",
    "indeed , the fraction of rapid rotators with near - ir signatures of disks observed by us in paper  i is roughly consistent with the frequency of disks generally among low - mass stars in the onc @xcite .    in a similar vein , a substantial fraction of slow",
    "rotators evidently lack disks altogether .",
    "roughly one - third of the slowly rotating tts in the sample studied by @xcite were observed to lack excess near - ir emission .",
    "more recent studies @xcite have found a similar fraction of slow rotators without strong near - ir excesses .",
    "guided by the predictions of magnetic disk - locking models , some authors have therefore hypothesized that slow rotators lacking near - ir excesses may in fact possess disks , but with large truncation radii .",
    "@xcite , for example , cited two slow rotators in that study possessing mid - ir excesses ( and ) as possible examples of this phenomenon .",
    "however , the results of this study indicate that , generally speaking , _ slowly rotating tts lacking near - ir excesses simply do not possess disks truncated at _ @xmath63 .",
    "thus , a division of tts into disked slow rotators and diskless rapid rotators is not an accurate representation of the observed relationship between stellar rotation and the presence of ir excesses among low - mass pms stars at 1 myr .",
    "while there is evidence that slow rotators tend to exhibit larger near - ir excesses than do rapid rotators @xcite , our observations do not support the interpretation that rapid rotators are , as a group , significantly different than slow rotators with respect to disk frequency .",
    "this result is important not only because it questions the idea of a linkage between disks and slow stellar rotation , but because it challenges the observational basis for the idea that the rapid rotators present at 1 myr are the evolutionary descendants of once - slow rotators .",
    "this has important implications for models of pms rotational evolution , as we now discuss .",
    "current rotational evolution models are able to reproduce in some detail the observed evolution of rotation rates of low - mass stars over a range of ages , from about 1 myr to the present - day sun .",
    "such a statement represents a triumph at both extremes of stellar rotation ; a long - standing problem in modeling the rotational evolution of low - mass stars has been to simultaneously explain the origin of both slow rotators ( @xmath64 km / s ) and ultra - fast rotators ( @xmath65 km / s ) on the zams .",
    "the nature of this  slow and rapid rotator problem \" has been discussed in detail in several recent studies @xcite .",
    "in essence , this problem has been one of dispersion .",
    "the question faced by rotational evolution models has been : by what means is the large dispersion of rotation rates observed on the zams created ?",
    "implicit in this question is the assumed _ model initial conditions _ , which are a fundamental ingredient in constructing the rotational evolution models .",
    "the initial conditions adopted by most current rotational evolution models are predicated upon previous observations of tts in taurus and orion which have linked the presence of disks to slow stellar rotation , and which have suggested that slow rotators precede rapid rotators in an evolutionary sequence .",
    "thus , the models typically begin their calculations with a population of slow rotators ( i.e. @xmath66 days ) possessing a relatively small dispersion of rotation rates @xcite .",
    "however , the evidence presented in this paper and in paper  i questions some of the assumptions that have guided the choice of model initial conditions .",
    "as we discussed in the previous section , we have not found compelling evidence on the basis of disk frequency that the rapid rotators present at 1 myr collectively represent an evolved state of the slow rotators .",
    "rather , our observations suggest that _ the rapid rotators should be considered just as important as the slow rotators for defining the model initial conditions_.    considering the most rapidly rotating tts ( @xmath67 days ; paper  i ) together with the slow rotators gives the low - mass pms population at 1 myr a very large dispersion of rotation rates , one that matches  or even exceeds  that observed among low - mass pleiads ( @xmath68 myr ) .",
    "while the differences observed among pleiads in different mass ranges may suggest somewhat different rotational histories for stars of different masses @xcite , one thing is clear : _ the dispersion of stellar rotation rates observed among low - mass zams stars is already present at 1 myr _ @xcite .",
    "the solution to the  dispersion problem \" of at once accounting for the slow rotators and the ufrs on the zams may largely depend upon taking proper account of the large dispersion that is already present at 1 myr .    whether the large dispersion of rotation rates present at 1 myr is itself a product of early angular momentum evolution (",
    "perhaps disk - regulated ) , or simply a reflection of the initial conditions of star formation , or some combination of the two , is a question that observations and rotational evolution models must now answer . while observations of tts are presently our primary informants of the initial conditions of rotational evolution , tts at 1 myr do not themselves represent the  beginning \" of the angular momentum evolution problem .",
    "as @xcite have emphasized , disk - locking may act to significantly impact the angular momentum of stars prior to even the very young age of the onc .",
    "eventually , rotational studies of still - embedded objects ( via , e.g. , photopolarimetric @xcite and scattered - light modeling @xcite techniques , or high - resolution ir spectroscopy @xcite ) , and of still - collapsing cloud cores , will be necessary to truly understand the initial conditions of angular momentum in young stars .",
    "nonetheless , the large dispersion of rotation rates present at 1 myr represents a critical early touchstone for rotational evolution models , and may prove to be a significant challenge to models that do not include rapid rotators at the beginning of their calculations @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , young , low - mass pms stars that do not show excess near - ir emission do not , in general , harbor truncated disks . put another way , disks , when present , nearly always reveal themselves at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "what does this tell us about the typical structure of tts disks , and how does this compare with the requirements of magnetic disk - locking models ?",
    "numerous researchers have investigated the details of magnetic coupling between an accreting tts and its circumstellar disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and others ) .",
    "an important prediction of magnetic disk - locking models is that the disk should truncate at a radius , @xmath4 , that is close to the co - rotation radius , @xmath5 , if the disk is to effectively regulate the star s rotation while at the same time allowing for accretion onto the stellar surface .",
    "@xcite , for example , employs several lines of argument to demonstrate that @xmath69 is required in order for the magnetic star - disk interaction to prevent an accreting tts from experiencing significant spin - up torques .",
    "is this basic prediction of the disk - locking hypothesis  that @xmath11in fact consistent with the near - ir observations of tts ?",
    "several authors have modeled the near - ir emission from tts disks , taking into account such factors as inner disk truncation radius , disk accretion rate , stellar rotation period , and stellar magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "@xcite have also included the effects of magnetic heating in their calculations .",
    "a general result of these modeling efforts has been that disks with relatively small inner cavities ",

    "the central star is characterized by @xmath73k ( appropriate for a spectral type of @xmath74 m0 ) and @xmath75 , typical of low - mass stars in the onc @xcite .",
    "the models assume zero extinction , and the disk inclination angle is fixed at @xmath45 ( i.e. face on ) . for each model ,",
    "the near - ir  excess - color \" diagnostic used by us in paper  i and by @xcite , @xmath76 , is computed as the difference between the total star@xmath48disk @xmath77 color and the photospheric @xmath77 color .",
    "the range of @xmath78 considered here corresponds to approximately @xmath79 days if @xmath47 , representative of the range of stellar rotation periods observed among tts @xcite .",
    "[ montefig ] illustrates that disks with small @xmath4 are needed to reproduce the very strong excesses [ e.g.  @xmath80 mag ] that many tts exhibit @xcite .",
    "disk models with large @xmath4 produce only very modest excesses [ @xmath81 mag ] for typical @xmath71 .",
    "thus disk - locked slow rotators with @xmath11 are _ not _ in general expected to show their disks in the near - ir .",
    "on the other hand , excess emission at near - ir wavelengths _ is _ expected from stars that are disk - locked at relatively short rotation periods , for which @xmath11 implies @xmath82 . in other words ,",
    "the correlation between near - ir excess and stellar rotation period that has been reported in the literature @xcite  in which the slowest rotators tend to exhibit the largest near - ir excesses  is in the _ opposite sense _ of that predicted from disks with @xmath11 .",
    "this suggests that the condition required for the regulation of stellar angular momentum  that the disk truncate near the co - rotation radius  is _ not _ satisfied by most tts disks ( see also @xcite who argues this point on theoretical grounds ) .",
    "interestingly , models in which the disk truncates well inside of co - rotation may be able to explain both the magnitude and the _ sense _ of the correlation between strength of near - ir excess and stellar rotation period observed by @xcite .",
    "the basic idea here , as suggested by @xcite , rests upon the fact that the most commonly used near - ir disk diagnostics ",
    "@xmath76are really measures of  excess color \" , not excess flux per se .",
    "consequently , disks with @xmath82 can show relatively small color - excesses that belie the presence of substantial near - ir excess flux because a non - negligible disk contribution at @xmath37 flattens the @xmath77 color .",
    "this effect becomes most pronounced for high @xmath71 because as the inner disk edge becomes hotter with increasing @xmath71 , the disk s @xmath77 color becomes correspondingly bluer ( e.g.  fig .",
    "[ montefig ] ) . over a limited range of @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath76 becomes larger in magnitude as the inner edge of the disk becomes cooler , resulting in a more rapid decline of the disk contribution at @xmath37 than at @xmath50 .",
    "that is , the disk s color becomes redder as the size of the central cavity is increased @xcite . but",
    "this effect does not hold for arbitrarily large @xmath4 : if the cavity is made too large , the disk contribution at @xmath50 is lost as well , resulting in a loss of @xmath77 excess entirely . in this way",
    ", a correlation between near - ir  excess color \" and slow rotation might be produced even if @xmath4 is typically some small fraction of @xmath5 .",
    "magnetospheric accretion models in which @xmath70 have been considered previously @xcite . in these models , the disk truncates at a point that is determined by the balance between magnetospheric and accretion pressures , relative to the co - rotation radius . in this way , @xmath4 ( and hence near - ir  excess color \" ) can correlate with @xmath43 ( through the dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath43 ) , but @xmath83 may deviate significantly from unity depending upon @xmath71 and @xmath84 .",
    "in fact , @xcite calculate that @xmath85 , @xmath86 g , and @xmath87 days , results in @xmath880.75 , and less for longer rotation periods .",
    "in this picture , the star - disk interaction may not in general be suitable for effecting disk - regulated stellar rotation in the manner usually envisioned in ",

    "these ideas are intriguing , but preliminary .",
    "more fundamentally , we consider the question of disk truncation as critical for any examination of the observational evidence for disk - regulated stellar angular momentum , and we encourage continued observational and modeling effort aimed at determining whether tts disks in fact truncate in the manner required by disk - locking models .",
    "we have used new and existing mid - ir photometry to search for circumstellar disks among 32 low - mass pms stars in the onc and in taurus - auriga for which rotation periods have been measured but which do not show evidence for disks at near - ir wavelengths . our principal aim in this study has been to determine whether these stars harbor disks with large inner truncation radii , or if they are simply diskless .",
    "the stars in our sample are roughly evenly divided between slow ( @xmath1 days ) and rapid ( @xmath41 days ) rotators .",

    "this includes a pms population of  ultra - fast rotators \" rotating near breakup velocity .",
    "the inclusion of rapid rotators at the beginning of rotational evolution calculations may lessen the degree to which the models require the braking action of disks @xcite .",
    "disks , when present , do not appear to truncate at co - rotation as required by disk - locking models for the regulation of stellar angular momentum .",
    "models of tts disks suggest that disks must extend well inside of co - rotation , i.e. @xmath70 , in order to explain the near - ir excesses observed among disked tts .",
    "furthermore , the previously reported positive correlations between slow stellar rotation period and excess near - ir emission are in the opposite sense of that predicted from disk - locking models .",

    "<S> we use mid - ir ( primarily 10 @xmath0 m ) photometry as a diagnostic for the presence of disks with inner cavities among 32 pre - main sequence stars in orion and taurus - auriga for which rotation periods are known and which do not show evidence for inner disks at near - ir wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> disks with inner cavities are predicted by magnetic disk - locking models that seek to explain the regulation of angular momentum in t tauri stars . </S>",
    "<S> only three stars in our sample show evidence for excess mid - ir emission . while these three stars may possess truncated disks consistent with magnetic disk - locking models , the remaining 29 stars in our sample do not . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , stars lacking near - ir excesses in general do not possess truncated disks to which they are magnetically coupled .    </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of this result for the hypothesis of disk - regulated angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , young stars can exist as slow rotators without the aid of present disk - locking , and there exist very young stars already rotating near breakup velocity whose subsequent angular momentum evolution will not be regulated by disks . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we question whether disks , when present , truncate in the manner required by disk - locking scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the need for rotational evolution models to take full account of the large dispersion of rotation rates present at 1 myr , which may allow the models to explain the rotational evolution of low - mass pre - main sequence stars in a way that does not depend upon braking by disks . </S>"
