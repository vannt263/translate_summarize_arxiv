    "one of the central issues in the physics of the high - temperature superconductors is the nature of the ground state at low doping . in particular ,",
    "the possible co - existence of ordering tendencies in the spin and charge sectors at low temperature is currently being actively investigated .",
    "@xcite experimentally at low temperature la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 ( lsco ) co - doped with nd ( lnsco ) exhibits static lattice deformation @xcite as well as incommensurate ( ic ) magnetic order at doping @xmath5 .",

    "recently similar behavior has also been found in la@xmath2ba@xmath3cuo@xmath4 ( lbco ) , @xcite @xmath5 .",
    "however for @xmath6 and in nd - free lsco , charge order has not been detected , while ic magnetism persists down to @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite thus while ic magnetic order is generically observed in the underdoped regime , static charge order seems to be confined to the neighborhood of @xmath8 .    ) .",
    "the orthorhombic @xmath9 and @xmath10 directions are shown . ]    theoretically the ic magnetism in the cuprates is often modeled as originating from static charge stripes , and since these are not universally present , one is forced to introduce additional concepts , such as  fluctuating \" stripes , electronic liquid crystals , etc .",
    "@xcite the microscopic origin of such states is still not clear and is currently being debated .",
    "an alternative explanation for the ic magnetism which follows naturally from the @xmath1 model , is the formation of a non - collinear spiral state , partially relieving the frustration due to the hole motion .",
    "@xcite such a state would not co - exist with charge order , as can be shown in the context of effective landau theory .",
    "@xcite however it is still possible that in the presence of anisotropic dzyaloshinski - moriya interactions the spin spiral could cause weak lattice modulation with period generically half that of the spiral .",
    "while the spiral ground state has a tendency to be unstable toward phase separation , we have shown recently that in the extended @xmath11 model the spiral can be stabilized by the presence of the additional hoppings .",
    "@xcite the spiral description was successfully applied to explain magnetic properties of lsco , such as the location of the elastic neutron scattering peaks and the change of the incommensurability direction by 45@xmath12 across the superconductor - insulator boundary ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "@xcite the spiral was also proposed as a candidate for the ground state in the spin - glass ( insulating ) phase for @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite    in the present work we address transport properties within the spiral framework .",
    "our main motivation comes from the recent experimental data in the spin - glass phase of lsco showing transport anisotropies as large as 50% to 70% , both in dc and ac measurements .",
    "@xcite it has been argued that these data provide indirect support to the notion of fluctuating stripes or electronic liquid crystals , but no quantitative theory exists that takes these concepts into account .",
    "@xcite recent infrared experiments that carefully identify phonon modes in lsco once again find no charge ordering tendencies in the spin - glass phase of this material .",
    "@xcite therefore we take the point of view that the ground state has a spiral spin structure , and calculate the transport anisotropy in the variable - range hopping ( vrh ) regime for low temperature and frequency , where the anisotropy has the largest value .",
    "we show that the spatial anisotropy of the hole wave - function in a spiral translates into anisotropy of the hopping transport .",
    "our main result is that for microscopic parameters appropriate for lsco ( within the @xmath11 model ) , the magnitude of the anisotropy is large ( 40%-90% , depending on temperature ) , and close to the one found experimentally .",
    "thus we demonstrate that the transport anisotropy data can be explained _ quantitatively _ within the spiral theory which does not involve any tendency of the holes to self - organize into charge stripes .",
    "the anisotropy was also analyzed in ref .",
    "on the basis of topological defect scattering in a spiral ; however the results are applicable to the quasi - metallic ( higher temperature ) regime where the anisotropy is very small , of the order of several percent .",
    "we emphasize that in the present work we consider the low - temperature , strongly - localized regime where it is clear from experiment that the anisotropy is the largest ( 10 - 20 times larger than the value in the metallic regime ) .",
    "finally we mention that the problem was also addressed within the spin - charge separation scenario which provides a description of the pseudogap phase @xcite and could lead to effective  insulating \" behavior ; however within this approach the transport anisotropy is linked to the magnetic correlation length anisotropy which can be taken from experiment but can not be explicitly calculated .",
    "our starting point is the description of the spin - glass phase ( @xmath14 ) developed in ref .   which is briefly summarized below .",
    "first , a single hole resides near the points @xmath15 , with a quadratic dispersion around them @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is perpendicular to the face of the magnetic brillouin zone and @xmath18 is parallel to the face . within the effective @xmath11 model for lsco ,",
    "the parameters are taken to be : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 . from now on we measure energies in units of @xmath21 ( i.e. set @xmath22 ) and lengths in units of the lattice spacing @xmath23 ( we set @xmath24 ) . by using the self - consistent born approximation one finds that these parameters lead to an almost isotropic dispersion @xmath25 , and a quasiparticle residue around the nodal points @xmath26 .",

    "[ fig1](a ) . in a perfect square lattice",
    "the spiral can be directed along any diagonal @xmath39 .",
    "however from the location of the elastic neutron scattering peaks @xcite the incommensurability is determined to be along the orthorhombic @xmath10 direction . in our picture",

    "@xcite on the theoretical side it was argued that @xmath42 is finite due to topological defects that lead to frustration of the long - range spiral order .",
    "@xcite since the localization length is less than the magnetic scale , @xmath43 , we expect that the effective description of transport properties , developed below in terms of the one - hole wave function , is quantitatively valid also at finite ( small ) doping ( i.e. the topological frustration mechanism does not affect our considerations ) .",
    "it should be noted that the above inequality while being explicit is also the strongest ( most restrictive ) condition we could give .",
    "its refinement would have to come out of a detailed theory of ic magnetism in the spin - glass phase ( i.e. a self - consistent theory that takes into account both the effective disorder and the spiral formation , generated by the doped holes ) .",
    "purely theoretical arguments aside , transport measurements in the doping range 0%-4% suggest that the system is in a strongly - localized regime at low temperatures , and we thus expect our calculations to be valid as long as doping is not too close to the insulator - metal boundary ( at 5.5% ) .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we analyze the properties of a localized hole in a spiral background , and in section iii we use the hole s wave function to calculate the in - plane transport anisotropies in the variable - range hopping regime .",

    "( [ dca ] ) reflects the difference in the wave - function overlap for the two electric field directions .",
    "the factors @xmath79 arise from the fact that the conductivity varies with the square of the carrier jump distance projection in the electric field direction .",
    "@xcite since the hole s dispersion is isotropic ( @xmath80 ) , the exponential part of the wave function is isotropic and consequently the resistivity anisotropy is expected to arise from the anisotropy of the exponential prefactors , whose overlap leads to ( [ dca ] ) .",
    "both the vrh length and @xmath72 thus remain isotropic within this formulation .",
    "it is clear from ( [ dca ] ) that as @xmath81 decreases ( i.e. @xmath82 increases ) the anisotropy grows , due to the increase of @xmath83 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](inset ) ) and consequently the more pronounced angular dependence of @xmath84 .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where also the evolution of the zero temperature anisotropy @xmath85 as a function of @xmath63 is shown for completeness in the inset .",
    "at very low temperature ( @xmath86 , @xcite i.e. @xmath87 ) we would have to take into account a crossover to the coulomb gap regime , which however would practically not influence the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "the data of ref .   were taken at temperatures @xmath88 , meaning that the lowest ratio @xmath89 ( we take @xmath90 ) .",
    "as the temperature increases beyond @xmath91 when @xmath92 , the approach based on vrh conduction ceases to be valid , as the conduction mechanism changes to impurity band conduction and eventually quasi - metallic behavior . in the most relevant low - temperature range below @xmath93 ( corresponding to largest anisotropy ) , both the calculated magnitude of @xmath94 and its temperature dependence are very close to the experimental results , @xcite although in these experiments the temperature is not low enough to penetrate the `` deep '' vrh regime @xmath95 where the anisotropy should increase even further .",
    "it should be also noted that there exists quite a bit of uncertainty in the determination of @xmath96 and hence in the determination of the exact value of @xmath94 from fig .",

    "inset : maximum ( @xmath97 ) anisotropy versus @xmath63 . ]      at finite frequency and temperature the calculation of the ac conductivity is a very complicated problem .",
    "however in the `` quantum '' limit when the frequency @xmath98 , the vrh ac conduction is expected to be dominated by resonant absorption by singly occupied pairs ( without involvement of phonons ) , and is usually relevant in doped semiconductors .",
    "@xcite the vrh length in the ac regime ( neglecting for a moment the angular dependence of the states ) is logarithmic : @xcite @xmath99 , which is the main difference from the dc case . from now on we denote @xmath100 .",
    "the formula for @xmath101 follows from the fact that upon evaluation of the conductivity , the most effective pairs are the ones that satisfy : @xcite @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the overlap integral , and a typical estimate of the prefactor is @xmath104 .",

    "@xcite    the generalization of the mott - shklovskii - efros formula to the anisotropic case is straightforward , as it amounts to taking into account the non - exponential ( angle - dependent ) part of the wave - function , leading to the replacement ( with logarithmic accuracy ) : @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is defined in ( [ dca ] ) . taking also into account the expressions for @xmath109 ( [ lambda ] ) , we obtain for the resistivity anisotropy :",
    "@xmath110 the expression ( [ aca ] ) is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . due to the logarithmic dependence , in the theoretical limit of zero frequency the anisotropy would vanish ( albeit very slowly ) , i.e. @xmath111",
    ". however one must keep in mind that the above expressions are not valid at arbitrary low frequencies , as we must have @xmath112 .",
    "generally we find that the ( maximum ) ac anisotropy of 30 - 40% is somewhat smaller than the dc anisotropy .     in the regime @xmath113 , and",
    "@xmath114 , for @xmath115 . ]    when attempting to compare our results to the experimental data of ref .",
    "we realize that @xmath116 and @xmath81 are not sufficiently low , nor is the difference between them sufficiently high to justify the separation into  quantum \" and  thermal \" vrh conduction and consequently the mott - shklovskii - efros approach .",

    ". moreover , upon increasing the frequency to @xmath121 , a change of behavior from insulating to conducting takes place , a broad peak develops , @xcite and consequently it is not clear to us that the ac data are ever in a clean vrh regime . in spite of all this the magnitude of the calculated",
    "anisotropy agrees reasonably well with experiment",
    ". it should be experimentally possible to lower the temperature ( towards the mk range ) as well as @xmath116 in order to probe the vrh ac anisotropy more reliably and compare with our theory .",
    "we would like to reiterate that in our theory there is no tendency of the holes to form charge stripe - like structures .",
    "nevertheless the resistivity shows anisotropic behavior ( and so does the uniform magnetic susceptibility , to be discussed separately ) .",
    "it is particularly important , in our view , that the calculations presented in this work produce quantitative results , and we would thus hope that the successes of the present formulation would stimulate further exploration of the spiral and similar scenarios , not involving any charge - ordering tendencies .",
    "the present work is relevant to the spin - glass regime of la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 , @xmath14 .",
    "however we have also argued @xcite that the spin spiral structure could exist in the superconducting state @xmath122 .",
    "the theory naturally explains why the incommensurate direction , determined from elastic neutron scattering , rotates by 45@xmath123 exactly at the insulator - superconductor transition point .",
    "on the other hand it is usually argued that at @xmath124 both in charge - ordered lnsco @xcite and lbco , @xcite non - collinear spiral order is not consistent with experiment .",
    "we would indeed not claim that the spiral ground state is stable at that particular doping since in fact the spiral becomes commensurate with the lattice and therefore significant changes in the ground state could occur due to the spin - lattice coupling .    in conclusion ,",
    "starting from a spiral ground state which unambiguously follows from the extended @xmath1 model , we have calculated the in - plane anisotropy of the low - temperature dc and low - frequency ac resistivity of la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 in the spin - glass phase .",
