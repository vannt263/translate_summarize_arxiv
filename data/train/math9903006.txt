    "we discuss some more properties of this class of symplectic four - manifolds .",
    "we mostly restrict ourselves to the case @xmath182 , the reason being that in the holomorphic situation this class of complex surfaces ( admitting lefschetz fibrations of genus 2 without reducible fibers up to deformation ) are distinguished in the theory of complex surfaces by their topological invariants .",
    "moreover , there is a simple classification up to algebraic deformations : it consists of 3 infinite series , and each single class is sweeped out by one algebraically irreducible family . as in the topological situation above",
    ", they are two - fold covers of rational surfaces .",
    "the precise result is :    [ horikawa.surf ] ( @xcite,@xcite ) let @xmath442 be a non - trivial genus 2 fibration ( holomorphic with smooth total space , but not necessarily lefschetz ) without reducible fibers",

    "the explicit form shows that all such surfaces arise as fiber connected sums of the three basic fibrations i@xmath625 , ii@xmath626 and iii@xmath627 ( the fiber connected sum is unique except in the last case because the monodromy generates the whole mapping class group ) .    from the monodromy representation one",
    "derives also easily that @xmath0 is simply connected ( cf .",
    "below ) . since we know signature @xmath586 and euler characteristic @xmath565 , it remains to investigate the parity of the intersection form to classify these complex surfaces up to homeomorphy .",

    "moreover , they fulfill @xmath630 so they lie on the noether line .",
    "it is also worthwile to discuss the exceptional cases as they are the basic building blocks :    * i@xmath625 : projecting onto the second factor inside @xmath374 we obtain a @xmath67-fibration over @xmath67 with @xmath631 singular fibers , so this surface is rational . *",
    "i@xmath627 : similarly we obtain an elliptic fibration over @xmath67 with @xmath632 singular fibers ; this is ( hence ) a fiber conected sum of three copies of the basic elliptic fibration of livn / moishezon mentioned above .",

    "we obtain a two - fold cover of @xmath447 branched along a sextic , which is a k3-surface . *",
    "iii@xmath627 : after contraction of the @xmath359-curve over @xmath224 one obtains a surface with @xmath633 which is ( thus ) of general type .",

    "for all this we refer to @xcite for details . moreover ,",

    "+ 3 )  this proposition together with the braid monodromy computation for algebraic curves by specialization also shows that the isotopy problem for symplectic submanifolds is equivalent to the following group theoretic problem : the subset of half - twists in @xmath660 is stable under inner automorphisms . on @xmath33-tuples @xmath661 of half - twists consider the equivalence relation generated by @xmath662 ( _ hurwitz - equivalence _ ) .",

    "then @xmath78 is poincar - dual to the first chern class of the square of a complex line bundle @xmath673 .",
    "let @xmath216 be a transverse section of @xmath674 with zero locus @xmath78 .",

    "let @xmath679 be a two - fold cover with branch locus @xmath78 .",
    "then there exists a complex line bundle @xmath673 , a transverse section @xmath216 of @xmath674 and a diffeomorphism of @xmath0 with @xmath680 over @xmath421 .      _ proof . _",
    "away from the branch locus we define @xmath673 at some @xmath682 as the space of linear forms @xmath683 on @xmath684 that change signs under application of the involution @xmath685 .",
    "explicitely , writing @xmath686 an element @xmath687 is given by the pair @xmath688 and the linear forms to be considered have the form @xmath689 for some @xmath690 . to extend @xmath673 across @xmath78",
    "let @xmath691 locally be given by @xmath692 where @xmath693 are complex valued and @xmath694 are @xmath695-tuples of coordinates . since @xmath696 the linear form @xmath697 sending the values @xmath698 of the function @xmath699 on the fibers of @xmath43 to @xmath700 is a frame for @xmath673 away from @xmath78 .",
    "the extension can thus be defined by taking @xmath697 as frame at the point of @xmath78 under study .",
    "next we observe that @xmath701 has a canonical section @xmath216 sending @xmath702 to @xmath703 .",
    "this section has a simple zero along @xmath78 since in the local coordinates @xmath704 we get @xmath705 to identify @xmath665 with @xmath706 let @xmath707 be the solutions to @xmath708 over some @xmath682 .",
    "so @xmath709 .",
    "let @xmath710 , @xmath711 . then @xmath712 and @xmath713 or @xmath714 .",

    "this identification clearly extends over @xmath78 as one easily checks using the local description .    in view of the functorial nature of the construction",
    "it follows also that a diffeomorphism of two - fold coverings @xmath719 induces an isomorphism of the associated complex line bundles @xmath720 whose square carries the canonical sections @xmath721 into each other .",
    "@xmath126        in particular , if @xmath723 there is a one - to - one correspondence between isomorphism classes of two - fold covers of @xmath421 and 2-divisible , oriented submanifolds of @xmath421 , given by the branch locus .",
    "_ let @xmath724 be the sheaf of germs of complex valued smooth functions on @xmath421 , and @xmath725 those without zeroes ( that we view as multiplicative abelian sheaf ) .",

    "a little diagram chase shows that these are compatible with the cohomology sequences of the other two sequences as follows : @xmath728 here all vertical arrows are isomorphisms .",
    "thus @xmath729 is ( non - canonically ) isomorphic to the direct sum of the 2-torsion in @xmath730 and the cokernel of the squaring map @xmath731 .",
    "we claim that these two data act effectively on the set of isomorphism classes of pairs @xmath681 .",
    "in fact , the 2-torsion of @xmath730 exactly parametrizes isomorphism classes of complex line bundles @xmath673 with @xmath732 a given class ( here the poincar - dual of @xmath78 ) .",
    "once @xmath673 is fixed , the space of isomorphisms @xmath733 induces an action on the space of ( transverse ) sections @xmath216 of @xmath674 .",
    "now for any two sections @xmath721 having the same zero locus @xmath78 the function @xmath734 has no zeros ( so @xmath735 ) and multiplication by @xmath683 induces the ( unique ) isomorphism of @xmath674 carrying @xmath216 to @xmath736 .",
    "this comes from an isomorphism of @xmath673 iff @xmath683 can be written as a square .",
    "conversely , multiplication of @xmath216 by any non - square @xmath683 leads to a pair @xmath737 that is not equivalent to @xmath681 in the considered sense .",

    "@xmath126    in the holomorphic category ,",
    "given @xmath78 and @xmath673 there is at most one isomorphism class of sections @xmath216 of @xmath674 having a holomorphic representative .",
    "the reason is that by the identity theorem any two holomorphic sections of a holomorphic line bundle with the same zero divisor differ only by a constant .",
