    "we now turn to the mixed correlator  @xcite . the total interference contribution , @xmath118 is @xmath119 the interference part of the mixed noise shows different features from @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "it is proportional to the interference part of the charge noise @xmath122 times @xmath123 , which is the average energy of the electrons injected into the system at the left contact , with respect to @xmath124 .",
    "it is hence non - vanishing only if the system is driven out of equilibrium and temperature is finite . in fig .",

    "we find @xmath128 and @xmath129 giving as a consequence that the interference contribution to the correlator between fluctuations of the energy carried by the electrons ( holes ) and the total charge current is zero .",
    "moreover , we have in general @xmath130 , apart for the case when @xmath131 and @xmath106 is symmetric with respect to one of its nodes , so that the holes and the electrons are symmetrically distributed in energy with respect to @xmath52 . in that case",
    "they just have opposite sign .",
    "if an asymmetry in the energy distribution of the electron- and hole - like excitations is introduced _ only _ as an effect of the dc - bias , see e.g. the case of the harmonic signal shown in fig .",
    "[ fig]e ) , then we have @xmath132 .    the transport contribution , @xmath133 , is given by @xmath134 at zero temperature , it is the only non - vanishing contribution to the mixed noise , @xmath135 .",
    "we can separate a contribution due to electron - like excitations from the one due to hole - like excitations @xmath136 the quantity @xmath137 is formally similar to the definition of @xmath138 , @xmath139 but each contribution coming from a different subband @xmath2 is weighted by its corresponding energy .",
    "it can thus be understood as the total average energy transported by @xmath140-like excitations multiplied by @xmath141 the corresponding charge .",
    "indeed , @xmath142 corresponds to the power @xmath143 dissipated to one of the leads per period . in a two - terminal conductor characterized by energy - independent transmission probability at the central scatterer ,",
    "the energy is equally dissipated in the two reservoirs resulting in the factor @xmath144 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig]f ) we plot @xmath145 at zero temperature as a function of the dc part of the driving signal .",
    "the correlators @xmath146 and @xmath147 have opposite signs , as a consequence of the fact that electron- and hole- excitations have different charges but both give a contribution to the energy current of the same sign .",
    "moreover , they become negligible when @xmath148 or @xmath149 , respectively , since @xmath150 and @xmath151 are suppressed in these voltage ranges .",
    "this leads to a change of sign of the total transport contribution @xmath152 as a function of @xmath127 , in contrast to @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "we now relate the mixed noise to the zero frequency correlator between the power fluctuations and the charge current fluctuations , @xmath155 , a measurable quantity . here , we define @xmath156 , the operator for the power provided by the time - dependent voltage source .",
    "we find @xmath157 , since neither charge nor energy can be accumulated in the conductor .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath158 with the mixed correlator contributions discussed in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sintx_tot ] ) and ( [ eq : setrt ] ) .",
    "importantly , for a completely transparent scatterer , @xmath159 , @xmath160 is the only contribution to the zero - frequency correlator of power and charge current fluctuations ; if the transparency of the scatterer is reduced , the second term which corresponds to @xmath161 , is the dominant one .",
    "both terms should thus be well observable .",
    "we considered a two - terminal conductor subjected to a time - periodic bias voltage .",
    "we discussed the correlator of charge current fluctuations and energy current fluctuations and the correlator between charge and energy current fluctuations .",
    "all the considered correlators show a transport contribution , due to correlations between particles exchanged between the two leads , and an interference contribution , due to the exchange of particles between different energy states in the same lead .",
    "the mixed noise is nonzero since electrons and holes are carriers both of charge and energy . at zero temperature , it is formally analogous to the charge noise , but now what is partitioned at the scatterer is not the number of impinging electrons or holes , but their energy , averaged over the different subbands .",
    "in contrast with charge and energy noise , it does not show a minimum as a function of an applied dc bias , but it changes sign when the bias is reversed .",
    "all discussed effects are expected to be observable by looking at the correlations between power and charge current fluctuations , under given conditions .",
