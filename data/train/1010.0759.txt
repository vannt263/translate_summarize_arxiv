    "this is the second in a series of two papers devoted to a relativistic computation of torques from an external perturber on a thin disc due to interactions at the lindblad resonances , i.e. locations in the disc where the orbital frequency @xmath4 and the radial epicyclic frequency @xmath5 satisfy @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the pattern speed of the perturbation .",
    "such resonances have been extensively studied in the nonrelativistic case ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the first paper ( `` paper i '' ) , we performed this computation for a general time - stationary , axisymmetric , spacetime with an equatorial plane of symmetry and a metric perturbation @xmath8 that respects the equatorial symmetry .",
    "this paper ( `` paper ii '' ) completes the evaluation of the lindblad torque in the case of most interest : the perturbation of the accretion disc surrounding a schwarzschild or kerr black hole by a small secondary also orbiting in the equatorial plane .",
    "such computations of the lindblad resonant strengths may be relevant in the context of electromagnetic counterparts to binary black hole mergers , particularly if an inner disc is involved @xcite .",
    "( the more complicated case of perturbations outside of the equatorial plane  as may occur in the case of a merger where the primary hole is rotating and the secondary is in an inclined orbit  is left to future work . )    the resonant torque formula in paper i depended on the geodesic properties in the unperturbed spacetime as well as being proportional to the square of the absolute value of the resonant amplitude @xmath9 , which was a function of the @xmath10 fourier component of the metric perturbation @xmath8 and its spatial derivative @xmath11 .",
    "the construction of these perturbations generally depends on the solution for the weyl tensor component @xmath12 , which may be solved using a separable wave equation with a source given by the stress - energy tensor associated with the perturber @xcite ; and then @xmath8 may be obtained by applying a second - order differential operator to a master potential @xcite , which may be derived from @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "fortunately , for our computations there is a way to circumvent the @xcite procedure : paper i showed that the particular combination of metric perturbations we require is related to @xmath13 , the power delivered to a test particle in a slightly eccentric orbit by the @xmath10 component of the perturbation . by replacing the perturber with an equivalent gravitational wave source  either incoming from past null infinity in the case of an inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) , or emerging from the past horizon in the case of an outer lindblad resonance ( olr )  we may equate @xmath13 with the power absorbed from the gravitational wave .",
    "however , energy is conserved on a time - independent background metric , and thus @xmath13 can be related to the interference between the equivalent gravitational wave representing the perturbation and the gravitational wave emitted by the test particle .",
    "this allows us to express the resonant amplitude and hence the resonant torque in terms of the waveforms emitted by the perturber and the test particle ( both to future null infinity and into the future horizon ) , so that standard methods to solve for @xmath12 are sufficient .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : metric ]",
    ", we introduce the kerr metric and review the associated standard notation .",
    "section  [ sec : geodesics ] reviews the geodesics in the kerr spacetime and their description with action - angle variables , and section  [ sec : modes ] describes the compuation of the perturbation in the weyl scalar @xmath12 ; while both of these subjects are standard , there are some differences in our treatment that are particularly suited to the problem at hand , and we make frequent use of intermediate results when taking the nonrelativistic limit , so an extended discussion is warranted .",
    "section  [ sec : resonantamp ] presents the key new theoretical result of this paper , relating the behaviour of @xmath12 near the horizon and at infinity to the resonant amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "we recompute the resonant amplitudes in the kepler problem in section  [ sec : kepler ] , and then proceed to investigate the lindblad resonances in the schwarzschild problem in section  [ sec : schwarzschild ] .",
    "section  [ sec : kerr ] then considers the lindblad resonance amplitudes associated with equatorial orbits in the kerr spacetime .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we parameterize the kerr black hole sequence with the gravitational mass @xmath14 and the specific angular momentum @xmath15 .",
    "we use relativistic units where the newtonian gravitational constant and the speed of light are equal to unity .",
    "the dimensionless angular momentum is @xmath16 .",
    "the kerr metric in boyer - lindquist coordinates @xcite is @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "the weyl scalar @xmath12 used to describe the emitted gravitational waveform is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the weyl tensor , and the equivalence to the component formed from the riemann tensor @xmath27 is due to the newman - penrose basis conditions .",
    "the horizons of the black hole are at radial coordinate @xmath28 particles very close to the horizon ( @xmath29 ) rotate at a pattern speed of the hole s angular velocity : @xmath30    note that for real coordinates , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the complex conjugate ; however we will occasionally analytically continue @xmath34 to complex values , in which case the barred quantities are not the complex conjugates of the unbarred quantities : @xmath35 .",
    "finally , we define @xmath36 and use the angular operator @xmath37      our notation appears to be common in the literature but other examples can be found .",

    "as is well - known , the action for a particle of mass @xmath55 is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the proper time along the particle trajectory . for our purposes , the fastest route to the torque formula is _ not _ to use the covariant representation of the action but rather to explicitly parameterize the particle s trajectory using the coordinate time @xmath58 , which is always possible outside the outer horizon .",
    "this method , which explicitly keeps only the 3 physical degrees of freedom , is best suited to a perturbation analysis .    as in newtonian perturbation theory analyses , it is most convenient to work with action - angle variables , using the 3 + 1 version of the hamiltonian that retains no gauge freedom associated with the particle trajectory .",
    "@xcite constructed a set of action - angle variables in which the particle s trajectory is parameterized by _ proper _",
    "time @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is promoted to a dynamical variable ( with conjugate momentum @xmath59 ) .",
    "their actions @xmath60 are equal to ours , since the momenta are the same , however the angle variables are different since ours advance at uniform rate with respect to coordinate time and theirs advance at a uniform rate with respect to proper time .",
    "thus the fourier decompositions are also different .",
    "other works that have constructed the hamiltonian for geodesic motion in 4-dimensional space have projected the motion into the 3 physical degrees of freedom @xcite , but appear not to have constructed the full transformation from action - angle variables to the familiar spatial coordinates and momenta , which we will need to complete here .",
    "@xcite considered resonances in inspiralling black hole binaries , but parameterize their trajectory in terms of the `` mino time '' @xmath61 @xcite .",

    "the newtonian formulae for the torque applied to a disc at the lindblad resonances associated with a perturber on a circular equatorial orbit have been extended into the relativistic regime .",
    "the calculation has revealed both new physical effects , and has provided a mathematical connection between seemingly disparate phenomena : resonant torques and gravitational radiation .    at the _ physical _ level",
    ", we have learned that relativistic effects introduce an additional @xmath0 inner lindblad resonance at which the pericentre precession rate of the test particle matches the pattern speed of the perturbation .",
    "this has no newtonian keplerian analogue , but in quasi - newtonian language one can think of it as being due to the steepening of the potential .",
    "indeed , any newtonian potential with an isco will have this resonance",
    ". we found , however , that the quasi - newtonian calculation of the resonant strength , which is due to the tidal octupole , is suppressed by tens of percents due to gravitomagnetic corrections even at @xmath404 . in this sense",
    "the @xmath0 ilr is a relativistic beast .    at the _ mathematical _ level",

    "this connection arose from general principles : ( i ) the conservation of energy and angular momentum when the contribution to both from gravitational waves is included ; ( ii ) the fact that , aside from the @xmath405 and 1 modes that do not contribute to resonant transfer , the entire perturbed spacetime structure in the vacuum regions is determined by the radiation degrees of freedom , described for type d spacetimes by @xmath12 ; and ( iii ) the ability to describe epicyclic motion of the test particle via hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "this was not expected when we began the calculation , and we are still lacking an intuitive explanation .",
    "the relativistic corrections to the lindblad resonance formulae  particularly the existence of the new @xmath0 ilr and the strengthening of the @xmath406 ilrs  may be important in binary black hole merger scenarios that involve an inner disc .",
    "this is especially true for the proposal of @xcite , in which a bright electromagnetic counterpart is produced by resonant heating of this inner disc . a more full treatment of disc evolution including the new resonance as well as other newtonian aspects of disc physics is beyond the scope of this paper ; however , simple considerations suggest that this would be a fruitful exercise . @xcite computed the inner disc evolution for a primary hole of mass @xmath407 and mass ratio @xmath408 , used newtonian formulae for the torque , and treated the resonant torques as continuously distributed in radius ( which may be appropriate for sufficiently small @xmath409 ) .",
    "they find that the inner disc is truncated at @xmath410 until @xmath411 ( see figs . 3 and 4 of @xcite ) ; it is thus plausible that in a full treatment including the discrete nature of the lindblad resonances , the strong @xmath385 ilr would truncate the disc .",
    "if this is the case , then even the weak @xmath0 ilr could be a significant contributor to resonant heating : while it is 3 orders of magnitude weaker than the @xmath385 ilr at @xmath369 , if material in the @xmath385 ilr has been mostly cleared it is no longer obvious which resonance dominates the torque .",
    "this is especially true for retrograde configurations , where the @xmath0 ilr is enhanced .",
    "while the distribution of values of @xmath15 is presently quite uncertain , in the context of electromagnetic counterparts to a low - frequency gravitational wave detector such as the _ laser interferometer space antenna _ the value of @xmath15 for each event will in many cases be known to high precision ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . due to the weakness of the @xmath0 ilr",
    ", it may also be important to account for other weak resonances , e.g. inclination resonances in the case of a spinning primary ; we have not computed the strengths of inclination resonances in this paper , but note that the techniques described here should be applicable to that problem .",
