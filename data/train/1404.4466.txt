    "the problem of minimizing the energy can be phrased as a variational principle over _ matrix product _ ( or _ purely generated @xmath0-finitely correlated _ )",
    "_ states _ @xcite . the natural analogue that also encompasses mixed quantum states are _ matrix product operators_. again , they feature strongly in numerical algorithms @xcite , for example when investigating stationary states of local liouvillians modelling open quantum systems @xcite or gibbs states @xcite .",
    "however , general matrix product operators are not guaranteed to represent physical states , which is the source of considerable conceptual and computational difficulties .",
    "it would thus be highly desirable to design an efficient algorithm capable of checking whether a given matrix product representation defines a positive operator . to decide",
    "if such an efficient `` local test for positivity '' exists is a fundamental problem in the field , implicit already in its early formulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) .    here , we address and answer this question : determining whether a matrix product operator defines a physical state in the thermodynamic limit is a provably _",
    "undecidable problem_. we also show that the bounded version of the problem is -hard in the number of tensors , burying hopes that one could find an efficient algorithm testing for positivity exactly .",
    "this is proven for quantum spin chains with local dimension @xmath1 by a polynomial reduction from the _ post correspondence problem _ and a bounded variant thereof .    to give a practical example",
    ", one can approximate stationary states of local liouvillians by iteratively applying the liouvillian to a state described as a matrix product operator and subsequently truncating the tensors . to avoid inconsistent results",
    ", one has to check whether the truncation step has caused the state to become `` too unphysical '' in that it has created eigenvalues that are more negative than some chosen tolerance threshold .",
    "we prove such a check to be unfeasible .",
    "the practical implications of our work are as follows : one hand they motivate the quest for finding specific feasible instances that might exist .",

    "it is less widely appreciated in the physics community that similar structures are ubiquitous in classical probability theory : the hidden markov model ( hmm ) is a generalization of a markov chain , where the observable process @xmath3 does not need to be markovian but there is a stochastic process @xmath4 carrying additional information that renders the combined process @xmath5 markovian .",

    "a natural question is whether the rank condition alone characterizes those distributions that allow for a hmm with bond dimension @xmath8 .",
    "it has been known since the 1960s that this is _ not _ the case : there are distributions where @xmath20 for all @xmath21 , yet no hmm with finite bond dimension exists @xcite .",

    "the resulting form is known as a _ quasi - realization _ , offering the same concise description of the distribution as a hmm .",
    "these are , however , more difficult to work with computationally , as any variation of the local tensors can destroy global positivity . an important question thus is as follows : are the conditions on the tensor @xmath16 that guarantee global positivity computationally efficiently verifiable ? as we will see , the answer is _",

    "an important question is whether there are physically relevant instances for which positivity is efficiently decidable and how this can be exploited best in numerical algorithms .",

    "@xcite local purifications of positive mpos in terms of matrix product states are investigated and it is shown that the arising mps - bond dimension can in general not be bounded independently of the system size . this already suggest that such purifying mps would require high bond dimensions when used instead of mpos in numerical simulations . however , two constructive purification methods are suggested that are efficient when the rank of the mpo is polynomially bounded but in general necessarily inefficient @xcite . from our theorem  [ thm : hardness ]",
    "it also follows that this is no coincidence . to be more precise , a _ local purification method _ is an algorithm that receives an mpo instance @xmath59 and a system size @xmath15 with @xmath60 as input and outputs a local purification of @xmath61 .",

    "<S> tensor network states constitute an important variational set of quantum states for numerical studies of strongly correlated systems in condensed - matter physics , as well as in mathematical physics . </S>",
    "<S> this is specifically true for finitely correlated states or matrix - product operators , designed to capture mixed states of one - dimensional quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is a well - known open problem to find an efficient algorithm that decides whether a given matrix - product operator actually represents a physical state that in particular has no negative eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> we address and answer this question by showing that the problem is provably undecidable in the thermodynamic limit and that the bounded version of the problem is -hard in the system size . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we discuss numerous connections between tensor network methods and ( seemingly ) different concepts treated before in the literature , such as hidden markov models and tensor trains . </S>"
