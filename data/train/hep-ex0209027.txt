    "following the successful runi from 1992 to 1996 , the cdf detector has undergone a major upgrade  @xcite for the runii which begun in march 2001 .",
    "the approval for the addition of a time - of - flight detector was granted in january 1999 .",
    "the installation of the tof detector was completed in august 2001 and its data has been included in the cdfii readout since then .    the primary physics motivation for tof is to complement and enhance the particle identification capability provided by the central drift chamber ( cot ) since it distinguishes @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the momentum region of their cross - over in @xmath16 . with an expected time - of - flight resolution of @xmath0 ,",
    "the tof system will be capable of identifying charged kaons from pions by their flight time difference with at least two standard deviation separation up to kaon momenta of @xmath17 .",
    "such an addition results in an enhancement of the @xmath18 flavor identification power , crucial to improve the statistical precision in cp violation and @xmath19 mixing measurements .",
    "particle identification with tof is performed by measuring the time of arrival of a particle at the scintillator with respect to the collision time @xmath20 .",
    "the particle mass @xmath21 can then be determined from the momentum @xmath22 , the path - length @xmath23 , measured by the tracking system , and the time - of - flight @xmath24 measured by the tof :    @xmath25    figure  [ fig1 ] shows the time - of - flight difference between @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 and the separation power assuming a resolution of @xmath0 .",
    "the tof improves the @xmath26 separation in the momentum region of @xmath29 by @xmath30 or better .",
    "the cdfii tof detector  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite consists of 216 bars ( @xmath31 long and with a cross section of about @xmath32 ) of bicron bc-408 scintillator .",
    "the bars are installed at a radius of @xmath33 from the beam line in the @xmath34 of radial space available between the cylindrical outer wall of the central drift chamber ( cot ) and the inner wall of the cryostat of the super - conducting solenoid , covering a pseudo - rapidity region of roughly @xmath35 .",
    "a nineteen - stage fine mesh photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) , hamamatsu r7761 , with a diameter of @xmath36 inches is attached to each bar end , for a total of @xmath37 pmts in the system .",
    "these operate in the @xmath38 solenoidal magnetic field with an average gain reduction of @xmath39 from the nominal gain of @xmath40 .",
    "the optical connection between the pmt and the scintillator is provided by a compound parabolic concentrator .",
    "the pmt in turn is directly attached to a custom designed hv divider base which also connects to a preamplifier card for the readout .",
    "differential signal from the anode and the last dynode of the pmt is fed to the preamplifier , and drives , over @xmath41 of shielded twisted pair cable , front - end electronics that reside in a vme crate mounted outside the detector .",
    "the front - end signal is split into two : one for timing measurement and the other for pulse height measurement .",
    "the timing path enters a leading edge discriminator with an adjustable threshold , whose output serves as the start signal for the time - to - amplitude conversion ( tac ) circuit  @xcite .",
    "the tac ramp is terminated by a common stop clock edge , that is synchronized with the @xmath42 bunch crossing , and fanned out to all electronics channels with a design jitter less than @xmath43 .",
    "the voltage output from the tac is sampled by a 12-bit adc , characterized by a least count of roughly @xmath44 over a dynamic range of about @xmath45 .",
    "tac response has shown an excellent stability since the commissioning of the electronics , with a residual variation , after the calibrations , of less than @xmath44 .    the primary purpose for measuring the charge of pmt signals is to perform a correction for the dependence of the discriminator on signal amplitude .",
    "the charge measurement is done by a charge sensitive adc  @xcite .",
    "the current driver is switched on by a gate of adjustable width , and is initiated by the discriminator output , so that only the charge due to the pulse that fired the discriminator is integrated .",
    "the time at which a pmt pulse is registered , measured with respect to the nominal @xmath42 bunch crossing time , can be modeled by the following expression :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is a constant offset describing the propagation delays in the cables , @xmath20 represents the time at which the @xmath42 interaction occurred , @xmath48 is the time - of - flight of the particle impinging on the bar of scintillator of length @xmath23 , @xmath49 is the effective speed of light in the scintillator , and the last term describes the time - walk effect introduced by the leading edge discriminator .",
    "the @xmath50 coordinate is measured along the length of the bar by the tracking chamber , the positive and negative sign of the term proportional to @xmath50 corresponds to a pmt in the west or east end of the detector , respectively .",
    "the measurement of the parameters in eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] for each channel is an essential step toward reaching the goal of @xmath0 resolution , and it is performed regularly during periods of data taking .    when a single charged particle enters a bar , the time difference between signals reaching the east and west ends is essentially a linear function of the track entrance point along the bar , @xmath50 .",
    "a typical distribution of the time difference plotted as a function of @xmath50 is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the effective speed of light in the bar can be derived from the fitted slope . from the distribution of the residuals of this fit a first indication of the timing resolution of each pmt , can be obtained .",
    "the resolution averaged over all bars is typically @xmath51 or better .",
    "this is larger by approximately a factor two than the resolution of a mean time measurement , indicating that the tof resolution is not far from our design goals .",
    "it is worth notice here that as systematics effects can cancel in the time difference measurement , this estimate represents only an indication of the capabilities of the detector .",
    "tracks which hit the scintillator at the same @xmath50 position are found to have an adc response that is well described by a landau distribution .",
    "the width of the landau peak divided by the peak position is typically @xmath52 for all channels .",
    "the dependence of the pulse height on the measured time and the parameterization of the time slewing effect have been studied using a sample where each track passes through two adjacent bars of scintillator .",
    "depending on the path length in each bar , a range of adc responses is obtained on the two channels at the same end of the bar . at the same time",
    "because the track entrance point in each bar is similar , the time difference between the two channels depends mainly on time walk effects . due to finite attenuation length in the bars ( @xmath53 ) the pulse height depends on the entrance point of the track , @xmath50 . for this reason the slewing correction introduces a linear dependence in the time difference @xmath54 versus @xmath50 , resulting in a biased effective speed of light determination . after the time slewing correction the width of the speed of light distribution for all the pmts is significantly reduced and observed low - side tail in the distribution disappeared .",
    "after all calibrations and corrections were applied , the timing resolution of a given channel can be estimated by comparing the measured tof for a track with the expected tof under the pion mass hypothesis .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the distribution of the resolution obtained with this procedure .",
    "it shows a mean value of @xmath55 with an rms of @xmath56 , which is close to the design goals .    in figure  [ fig6 ]",
    "is shown the mass - momentum scatter plot computed using eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] for low momentum tracks . three clear clouds corresponding to pions , kaons and protons can be seen .",
    "actual realistic performance of the entire tof system can be obtained by analyzing the @xmath57 signal in a sample of events recorded by cdfii .",
    "the @xmath58 candidates are selected from all pairs of oppositely charged tracks by assuming the kaon mass , with the only constraint that the two tracks originated from the same vertex .",
    "both tracks are required to have a transverse momentum less than @xmath59 and valid reconstructed tof informations .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows the invariant mass distributions obtained before and after applying tof kaons particle identification .",
    "a clear signal peak in the distribution appears in the latter case , corresponding to a factor @xmath60 background reduction and @xmath61 signal efficiency .",
    "the primary purpose of the tof detector is to identify charged pions , kaons and protons . in the context of @xmath62 physics , particle identification is useful both for reconstructing @xmath62 decays and for @xmath18 flavor tagging . in particular",
    "the cdf tof detector was designed to substantially improve the statistical precision in the measurement of cp violation , as well as the sensitivity in measuring @xmath63 oscillations .",
    "+ by the term `` @xmath18 flavor tagging '' we mean the ensemble of procedures and algorithms which act to determine the flavor of the @xmath62 meson when it was produced .",
    "the figure of merit for a @xmath18 flavor tagging method is its `` total tagging effectiveness '' , @xmath64 .",
    "the efficiency @xmath65 accounts for the fact that we can apply a flavor tag only to a fraction @xmath66 of the @xmath62 candidates .",
    "the dilution @xmath67 is related to the fact that sometime the obtained tag is wrong .",
    "if we call @xmath68 the probability that the tag is correct , the dilution is then defined as @xmath69 , so for a perfect tag we will have @xmath70 , and for a random tag @xmath71 . the total tagging effectiveness @xmath64 determines the effective statistical power of the sample , so that , for example , the statistical error on the determination of a cp asymmetry @xmath72 with @xmath73 total candidates is proportional to @xmath74 .",
    "an additional flavor tagging method that would increases @xmath64 by a factor of two would lead to a reduced statistical error on @xmath72 by @xmath75 .",
    "the methods of @xmath18 flavor tagging can be divided in two categories : `` opposite - side '' tagging ( ost )  @xcite and the `` same - side '' tagging ( sst )  @xcite . the former relays on the fact that the dominant production mechanism of @xmath18 quarks in hadron collisions generates @xmath76 pairs . to identify the flavor of a reconstructed @xmath62 meson of interest",
    ", we identify the flavor of the second @xmath62 hadron in the event and infer the flavor at production of the primary one .",
    "the same - side flavor tag exploits instead the correlation between @xmath18 flavor and the charge of the particles accompanying the reconstructed @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , a @xmath77 is expected to be produced in association with a @xmath78 meson , and a @xmath79 with a @xmath80 .",
    "the cdfii tof can be used to enhance both opposite - side and same - side @xmath18 flavor tagging .",
    "the decays of @xmath81 hadrons will contain more likely a @xmath82 than a @xmath83 in the final state due to @xmath84 week decays . therefore identifying a charged kaon from the @xmath62-decay",
    "can be used as an opposite - side @xmath18 flavor tag . in figure  [ fig8 ] the montecarlo momentum spectrum of kaons from the opposite - side @xmath62 decay to the @xmath85 signal",
    "more than @xmath86 of the available kaons are in a momentum range where the cdfii tof can give a @xmath30 separation power from charged pions .",
    "the cdfii potential for the opposite - side flavor kaon tag using the tof has been estimated with a montecarlo simulation , assuming the design resolution of @xmath0 .",
    "this gave @xmath87 , which is more than a factor two higher than the typical values obtained in runi  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the tof can be used for same - side tagging as well . in the hadronization process when a @xmath63 meson is produced an @xmath88 pair must be popped from the vacuum during fragmentation . the remaining @xmath49 or @xmath89 quark can join a @xmath90 or @xmath91 quark to form a charged kaon .",
    "the charge of the kaon thus depends on the flavor of the @xmath63 meson at production .",
    "a factor four increase on @xmath64 has been obtained , using montecarlo simulations , for same - side tagging of @xmath63 using tof informations ( from @xmath92 to @xmath93 ) .    combining all the @xmath18 flavor tag methods available in runii",
    ", cdfii has estimated a total @xmath64 of @xmath94 for @xmath63 mesons using tof for particle identification  @xcite .",
    "this large effectiveness will greatly increase the sensitivity for the measurement of the @xmath4 mixing parameter @xmath95 , one of the unique measurement of tevatron during the runii . in figure  [ fig9 ] the luminosity required to achieve a five standard deviation observation of mixing as a function of the mixing parameter @xmath96",
    "the projection  @xcite is based on montecarlo simulation of fully hadronic decays of the @xmath4 hadrons , and assumes a fully operational cdf detector and trigger system , work is in progress to determine the sensitivity using runii data . within the standard model various experimental results",
    "indicate that @xmath97 at the @xmath98 confidence level  @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if mixing occurs as expected in the standard model , it should be observed even with a few hundreds of @xmath99 of total integrated luminosity .",
    "the new cdfii time - of - flight detector become operational in august 2001 . since then",
    ", it has working reliably without any significant problem .",
    "the first round of calibrations is available and preliminary studies show that the @xmath0 time resolution goal seems reachable .",
    "we expect substantial improvements using the tof in the `` b '' physics program of cdf in coming years .",
