    "<S> we present monte carlo simulation results for square - well homopolymers at a series of bond lengths . </S>",
    "<S> although the model contains only isotropic pairwise interactions , under appropriate conditions this system shows spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , where the chain exists in either a left- or a right - handed helical structure . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how this behavior depends upon the ratio between bond length and monomer radius .    </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : intro]naturally occurring polymers , such as proteins ( polypeptides ) and nucleic acids ( polynucleotides ) , are capable of adopting very specific single - chain conformations under certain conditions . </S>",
    "<S> it is believed that this structural specificity plays a crucial role in the biological function of a given molecule . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the essential mechanism of how the overall structure of a polymer arises from the basic interactions between its constituent monomers is of great fundamental interest . </S>",
    "<S> a recurring motif in many diverse biopolymers is the helix . </S>",
    "<S> this structure has also been observed in synthetic polymers  for example , meta - phenylacetylene oligomers @xcite , and the isotactic form of poly(methyl methacrylate ) @xcite in various solvents . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of helical structures in polymers with substantially different monomer chemistries suggests an underlying generic behavior , which has prompted significant efforts to produce `` minimal '' models that naturally display helical structures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an underlying assumption in the vast majority of these models is stated explicitly by kemp and chen @xcite : `` an isotropic potential interaction is not sufficient to produce helical ground states . '' in this letter , we present simulation results for a polymer model using only pairwise isotropic monomer interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly demonstrate that this model breaks chiral symmetry at low temperatures and show evidence that it forms stable helices .    the general theoretical perspective @xcite has been to view helix formation as a discrete process . each polymer element ( monomer ) </S>",
    "<S> can only take on one of two states , `` helical '' or `` coil '' ( non - helical ) , and a free energy is assigned to each of these states . </S>",
    "<S> this approach has been fairly successful in describing the helix - coil transition in polymer systems . </S>",
    "<S> one shortcoming of this approach , however , is that it presupposes the existence of a particular helix , and , as a consequence , it is difficult to determine the conditions under which a helical conformation can naturally arise .    </S>",
    "<S> another line of research has been to apply molecular simulations techniques to examine the structural behavior of minimal polymer models , which has lead to interesting results . </S>",
    "<S> zhou and coworkers discovered @xcite a freezing transition for linear homopolymers composed of tangent - hard spheres that interact with each other through an attractive square - well potential . during this discontinuous transition , the collapsed `` molten '' globule state freezes into a highly symmetric crystalline - like state . </S>",
    "<S> while this transition does result in structural specificity , the observed ordered state does not resemble any of the structural motifs seen in biopolymers . </S>",
    "<S> noguchi and yoshikawa @xcite extended the model of zhou and coworkers by adding a bond bending potential , which introduced stiffness to the polymer model . </S>",
    "<S> upon increasing the stiffness of the chain , toroidal and rod - like phases were observed  analogous to structures exhibited by isolated dna chains @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , they did not observe the formation of helices in their simulation studies . </S>",
    "<S> kemp and chen @xcite have developed a simple homopolymer model that displays a helix - coil transition ; however , the monomer - monomer interactions in this model are asymmetric .    for thick strings confined within a fixed geometry ( e.g. , inside a cube ) </S>",
    "<S> , a helix can be the optimal packing configuration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these `` close - packed '' configurations may play a role in determining the structure of linear chains in a similar manner as the close - packed structures for hard spheres play for the solid phase of spherically symmetric molecules . </S>",
    "<S> structures other than the helix were shown to optimize the packing under appropriate conditions ; the nature of the optimal structure depends on such parameters as the thickness and length of the string , as well as the geometry of the confinement .    </S>",
    "<S> although anisotropic , attractive interactions between monomers can induce a chain to form a helix , we will demonstrate that the delicate interplay between purely isotropic , attractive interactions and packing ( due to excluded volume interactions ) of monomer segments can also induce a helix . </S>",
    "<S> a homopolymer chain in poor solvent conditions will tend to collapse into a compact conformation in order to maximize self - interactions . beyond a critical packing fraction , </S>",
    "<S> optimal configurations tend to maximize the entropy available to a system . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for situations where the helix is the optimal configuration for a string , we expect a transition to a helical structure for a sufficiently string - like polymer model .    </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : simul]we consider polymers consisting of @xmath0 linearly bonded hard spheres of diameter @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between bonded spheres are restricted to lie between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the bond length , which is not necessarily equal to @xmath1 . </S>",

    "<S> for values @xmath59 , the behavior is as described above , but with only a single low - temperature peak observed in the isochoric heat capacity . </S>",
    "<S> for values @xmath60 , chiral symmetry breaking is not observed ; the observed histograms for @xmath41 remain unimodal and centered on zero across the studied temperature range . </S>",

    "<S> [ sec : discussion]we have shown that stiffness of the polymer induced by the bulkiness of the monomers plays an important role in the development of structure at low temperatures . for values of @xmath61 , the equilibrium low temperature structure appears to be helical ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> phasediag : fig ] ) ; further evidence for this is provided by the consistently low values for the quantity @xmath37 under these conditions , indicating an approximately constant value for @xmath29 across individual conformations . </S>",
    "<S> the torsional symmetry breaking associated with helix structure formation must be associated with a thermodynamic phase transition for an infinite system ; no attempt is made to establish the order of this transition , as the small size of the system studied would make any such attribution unreliable . </S>",
    "<S> we have identified these transitions by the associated increase in energy fluctuations ( maxima in heat capacity ) . across the temperature range studied , no ordered low temperature structures are observed for @xmath60 . for @xmath62 </S>",
    "<S> , the globule should freeze into an ordered crystalline phase @xcite at sufficiently low temperature . for other values of @xmath13 , however , the low temperature structure is still unclear .    for values @xmath63 , </S>",
    "<S> the helix - globule transition line is reentrant </S>",
    "<S> . with increasing @xmath13 , the helix initially gains , then rapidly loses stability with respect to the globule . at low temperature </S>",
    "<S> , there is a line of heat capacity maxima which coincides with a sudden drop in the torsion - curvature ratio and decrease in mean end - to - end distance for the observed helices . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret it as indicating a transition to a less extended helical structure at low temperature , since @xmath50 gives the pitch - radius ratio for a helix . </S>",
    "<S> this line of maxima appears to join with the helix - globule transition line for @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> no further heat capacity maxima or discontinuities in torsion are observed between this line and the lowest temperature studied . </S>",
    "<S> since the high temperature helix is not observed for @xmath64 , and there must exist a transition line between a symmetry breaking and a non - symmetry breaking state , we can therefore infer the existence of a helix - helix - globule triple point in the range @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the less extended helical structure is the low - temperature equilibrium configuration observed for all @xmath61 , and appears to increase in stability monotonically with @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> extrapolation of the helix - globule transition line and the helix - helix transition line to low temperatures for @xmath60 suggests that a further , low temperature helix - helix - globule triple point may exist .    </S>",
    "<S> the precise reasons for the occurrence of two helical structures separated by an apparent transition line , and for the sudden decrease in stability of the high temperature helix are , as yet , unclear . </S>",
    "<S> results using an anisotropic model @xcite , constructed to yield a specific helix , suggest a two - step mechanism for helix formation , where the initial globule - helix transition results in a structure with disordered end segments , followed by a transition to a fully - helical structure . </S>",
    "<S> another speculative possibility is that allowed helical states are discretized due to a preference for monomers to sit at interstitial sites in neighbouring layers of the helix , leading to a succession of helical phases separated by transitions rather than a continuum of possible torsion values . </S>",
    "<S> further study will be necessary to understand these behaviors .    </S>",
    "<S> another factor playing an important role is the overall _ length _ of the polymer . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the square - well chain model for different lengths @xmath0 , and preliminary results suggest that , though the system breaks chiral symmetry at low temperature for all chain lengths studied , helices are only stable inside a window of values for @xmath0 . an example low - temperature snapshot configuration for a longer polymer is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ configs : fig ] ( d ) ; a detailed examination of the influence of chain length on structure will be the subject of a further communication .    in summary , we have demonstrated spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking using a model which is achiral ( no dependence upon bond torsions ) and isotropic ( no dependence upon bond angles ) . </S>",
    "<S> this _ spontaneous _ symmetry breaking reflects the formation of helical structures at low temperature , providing support for the notion of helices as `` optimal configurations '' for string - like objects @xcite , which as such do not need to be `` engineered in '' to a model or molecule through specific directional interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we do not seek to suggest that directional interactions do not play an important role in the formation and stabilisation of helical structure ; however , the purely steric effect which we have demonstrated may also play a crucial role which we have not yet been aware of . </S>",
    "<S> the observed phase behavior for the model is rich , including an apparent helix - helix transition , with a reentrant helix - globule coexistence curve for one helix leading to a helix - globule - helix triple point , and offers many possibilities for further investigation . </S>"
