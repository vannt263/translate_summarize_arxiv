    "the dkp equation was given as a first member of the dkp hierarchy in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , the coupled kp equation was introduced as an extension of the kp equation whose solutions are given by the pfaffian form .",
    "the dkp equation was rediscovered as the pfaff lattice describing the partition function of a skew - symmetric matrix model in @xcite , and was also found as an orbit of some infinite - dimensional clifford group action in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 functions are given by the pfaffians of @xmath18 skew - symmetric matrices @xmath19 whose entries are denoted by @xmath20 for @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 each coefficient @xmath24 gives a sign corresponding to the parity of the permutation , @xmath25 here the elements @xmath20 satisfy @xmath26 where @xmath27 and others are the symmetry parameters .",
    "a realization of @xmath20 is given by @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 ( the same for @xmath30 ) and the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 satisfy the same equations for @xmath33 and @xmath34 evolutions , @xmath35 for an example of finite dimensional solution , we consider @xmath36 with some constants @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "the function @xmath39 is the exponential function , @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are arbitrary constants , and throughout this paper we assume the parameters @xmath43 to be ordered as , @xmath44 with those @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the elements @xmath45 become @xmath46 where @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .    as a generalization of this form of @xmath20",
    ", we consider an arbitrary @xmath49 skew - symmetric matrix @xmath50 .",
    "we then note that the @xmath18 matrix @xmath19 in the @xmath2-function @xmath3 can be expressed as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a @xmath53 matrix with its transpose @xmath54 , and it is given by @xmath55 in this paper , we discuss a classification problem of several soliton solutions given by ( [ q ] ) in terms of the @xmath5-matrix .",
    "note here that @xmath56 for @xmath57 , since the case with @xmath58 gives a trivial solution , i.e. @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "also note that one needs @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "one should also note that if @xmath63 ( i.e. @xmath64 ) , the corresponding solution satisfies the kp equation .",
    "this condition can be of course obtained from the structure of the @xmath5-matrix .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath65 , then @xmath66 vanishes identically ( the size of the pfaffian is @xmath67 , but the independent exponentials are three or less ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath68 with @xmath65 gives a solution of the kp equation , and it gives either one kp soliton solution or a resonant y - shape kp soliton : with a @xmath69 @xmath5-matrix , we have @xmath70 the function @xmath71 gives one kp soliton solution if one of @xmath72 is zero ( with others being positive ) , and y - shape kp soliton if all @xmath72 are positive .",
    "for example , with @xmath73 , we have @xmath74 which leads to @xmath75 the asymptotic values of @xmath76 then take @xmath77 note here that the one soliton exchange the asymptotic values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 , that is , this one soliton permutes the numbers , @xmath80 .",
    "we then label one soliton of the kp equation as an element of the permutation group @xmath81 , in this case @xmath82 , the symmetry group of order 3 .",
    "we denote the one soliton solution ( [ asoliton ] ) by @xmath83 $ ] , and call this type of soliton a - soliton ( `` a '' stands for type a lie algebra which is the underlying symmetry algebra for kp equation ) . in general , we denote one a - soliton by @xmath84 $ ] , if the function @xmath76 exchanges @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "we sometime identify @xmath84 $ ] as an element of the symmetry group .",
    "a generic solution of the dkp equation is then obtained for @xmath87 . in particular ,",
    "we obtain one soliton solution in the case @xmath88 with the @xmath5-matrix having just two nonzero elements in the upper triangular part .",
    "for example , we consider the @xmath5-matrix having @xmath89 and all others @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "then @xmath92 this gives @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "for each asymptotic of @xmath95 , one of the exponential terms in the @xmath2-function becomes dominant . in the case of ( [ onedsol ] )",
    ", we have @xmath96 thus , this one d - soliton exchanges @xmath97 with the values of @xmath76 where @xmath98 .",
    "this indicates a weyl - action of @xmath99-type : for example , @xmath100 may be expressed as @xmath101 we denote this d - soliton by @xmath102 $ ] .",

    "this relation implies a resonant bifurcation of one d - soliton into two a - solitons ( see section [ twosoliton ] ) .",
    "since one d - soliton has four @xmath105-parameters , we need to have @xmath106 parameters to describe @xmath7 d - soliton solution as a solution given by the @xmath2-function @xmath107 .",
    "however , we show in this paper that @xmath108 parameter solution can contain up to @xmath8 number of d - solitons ( this is quite different from the solitons of the kp equation ) .    in this paper , we study soliton solution of the dkp equation consisting of those a- and d - type soliton solutions . in section [ structure ] ,",
    "we give a general structure of the @xmath2-functions .",
    "then in section [ onesoliton ] , we discuss some details of one d - soliton solutions given by the @xmath5-matrix of size @xmath67 . here",
    "we also classify the soliton solutions obtained by @xmath67 @xmath5-matrices . in section [ twosoliton ] ,",
    "we present the soliton solutions for the case of @xmath109 @xmath5-matrices , and classify the soliton solutions consisting of only d - types .",
    "it turns out that the case with @xmath109 @xmath5-matrix can have either two or three d - solitons depending on the values of the parameters @xmath110 .",
    "the generic solution given by the @xmath5-matrix having all nonzero entries is then given by four a - solitons .",
    "finally we discuss the general case of @xmath4 @xmath5-matrices , i.e. @xmath106 , in section [ multisolitons ] .",
    "then we show that the number of d - solitons for those @xmath5-matrices having @xmath9 nonzero entries in the upper triangular part can be any number from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , contrary to the previous study ( see @xcite ) where the number of d - soliton is expected to be just @xmath7 .    in @xcite",
    ", we showed that the @xmath7-soliton solutions of the kp equation can be classified by the schubert decomposition of the grassmannian gr@xmath111 .",
    "we also expect that @xmath7-soliton solutions of the dkp equation can be classified by the similar decomposition of the orthogonal grassmannain ogr@xmath112 for some @xmath6",
    ". however , in this paper , we just present elementary feature of the @xmath7-soliton solutions based on the pfaffian structure of the @xmath2 function , which is already complicated but has several interesting aspects .",
    "we plan to discuss a classification problem based on the geometric structure of the orthogonal grassmannain in a future communication .",
    "we first note that the @xmath2-function ( [ tau ] ) with the @xmath19 matrix ( [ q ] ) has the following expansion theorem , i.e. the pfaffian version of the binet - cauchy theorem ( see @xcite for the details ) :    [ dtaubc ] the @xmath2-functions of ( [ tau ] ) with ( [ q ] ) can be expressed by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is @xmath18 submatrix of the @xmath115 matrix @xmath52 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 is @xmath18 skewsymmetric submatrix of the @xmath4 matrix @xmath118 , @xmath119 the lower triangular part is given by @xmath120 , and is left in blank .",
    "also @xmath121 is given by the wronskian determinant , @xmath122 the sign is due to the order ( [ orderp ] ) , i.e. @xmath123 .    from this formula of the @xmath2 function , the soliton solutions are completely determined by the nonzero coefficients of the pfaffians pf@xmath124 which are the plcker coordinates of the orthogonal grassmannan gr@xmath125 .",
    "for example , if all the coefficients are positive , then we have @xmath126-soliton solution in @xmath127 , that is , we have @xmath128 out - going line solitons in @xmath129 and @xmath130 in - coming line solitons in @xmath131 ( see @xcite ) . as we can see from @xcite that in particular , if @xmath132 we have an @xmath9-soliton solution similar to the kp equation , i.e. all @xmath9 solitons are a - solitons , and all the interactions are of t - types",
    ". then the main purpose of this paper is to identify soliton solution of the dkp equation with a certain combination of nonzero coefficients .    as the simplest example",
    ", the pfaffian pf@xmath133 is given by @xmath134 note here that if the indices in each term have partial overlap , then the product takes the minus sign , e.g. @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "this is a key for the classification of four a - solitons ( see section [ twosoliton ] ) .    from lemma [ dtaubc ]",
    ", one should note that each term in @xmath3 in ( [ tau ] ) is given by the product of @xmath128 exponentials @xmath137 , i.e. @xmath138 where @xmath139 , and they are the indices for the elements of the @xmath5-matrix , i.e. @xmath140 . as we will show , this structure of the @xmath2-functions will be important to identify a soliton solution in the asymptotics @xmath141 .      since the coefficients of the @xmath2-function are determined by the @xmath5-matrix , we give some remarks on the structure of the matrix . for a generic @xmath4 skew - symmetric matrix @xmath5 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath142 , there is a decomposition called _ skew - borel decomposition _",
    "@xcite , @xmath143 where @xmath144 , the group of invertible elements in the set of lower - triangular matrices with nonzero @xmath145 blocks proportional to identity along the diagonal , i.e. @xmath146 the matrix @xmath147 is the @xmath4 skew - symmetric matrix whose @xmath145 diagonal blocks are given by @xmath148 and all the other entries are zero , i.e. @xmath149 a non - generic element of @xmath150 may be obtained by a permutation matrix @xmath151 with @xmath152 ( i.e. @xmath153 ) , that is , we have @xmath154 where @xmath155 is not a generic element in @xmath156 .    [ b4 ] consider the case @xmath157 ( @xmath67 @xmath5-matrix ) .",
    "then the generic element @xmath5 can be expressed by @xmath158 with @xmath159 then the matrix @xmath5 is given by @xmath160 ( we leave the lower triangular part in blank for skew symmetric matrix . ) if a skew - symmetric matrix has zero at @xmath161-entry ( i.e. @xmath73 ) and others are nonzero , such matrix , say @xmath162 , can not be expressed in this form . in this case",
    ", one can consider the form @xmath163 with @xmath164 the matrix @xmath162 is then given by @xmath165 in particular , with @xmath166 , the @xmath67 identity matrix , we have @xmath167 defined by @xmath168 other non - generic element of @xmath5-matrix , say @xmath169 , having @xmath170 can be expressed by @xmath171 , @xmath172 with @xmath173 in particular , for @xmath166 we have @xmath174 defined by @xmath175 in the next section we show that those skew - symmetric matrices @xmath176 and @xmath177 define all the one d - soliton solutions .",
    "in general , one can start with @xmath147 to define the @xmath2-functions , that is , @xmath178 with @xmath179 of ( [ q ] ) . then consider a generalization of the @xmath19-matrix by replacing @xmath147 with @xmath180 for some @xmath181 .",
    "the role of @xmath182 can be understood as the change of order of the column vectors in @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath183 where the column vector @xmath184 , and @xmath185 indicates the permutation @xmath186 .",

    "then td - type of 2-solitons @xmath529,[2:8]$ ] is obtained from the bifurcation of @xmath535$]-soliton , which is one of the resonant solitons .",
    "also note that the exponentials associated to @xmath450 and @xmath451 become dominant for two d - solitons for either @xmath129 or @xmath131 .",
    "however those exponentials should not appear for this set of four a - solitons , that is , those four a - solitons can not be obtained from this @xmath5-matrix .",
    "this can be fixed by taking following @xmath5-matrix ( i.e. change td - type to t - type ) , @xmath536 in figure [ 2 - 4sol : fig ] , the right figure shows the 4-solitons generated by this @xmath5-matrix .",
    "we also mention that the @xmath66-function with the generic @xmath109 @xmath5-matrix having all nonzero entries gives four a - solitons of t - type , that is , they are the same type of the 4-soliton solution of the kp equation . just notice that the number of exponential terms in @xmath66 is @xmath537 , which is the same as the @xmath2-function for the kp equation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "then the asymptotic analysis of the @xmath2-functions shows that four a - solitons are given by @xmath484 , [ 2:6 ] , [ 3:7]$ ] and @xmath493 $ ] , which are of t - type .",
    "an example of the generic @xmath5-matrix for nonsingular @xmath2-function is given by the skew - symmetric matrix having 1 s in all the entries in the upper triangular part .",
    "-matrices given by ( [ 4bb ] ) .",
    "the left figure shows two d - solitons obtained by the same matrix except @xmath538 and @xmath539 ( note the extra resonant structure at the intesection region of those d - solitons.,width=340 ]",
    "for the general case with arbitrary @xmath106 , we consider the @xmath5-matrix with @xmath9 numbers of nozero entries @xmath140 for @xmath540 and @xmath541 in the upper triangular part .",
    "although there is a scheme to find the @xmath5-matrix for sign - definite @xmath107 ( i.e. having all the same sign in the pfaffian coefficients ) , the generalization of proposition [ 2dsolitons ] seems to be difficult .",
    "however , we can show the following propositions regarding to the number of d - solitons for two special cases :      apply lemma [ cij ] , and find the dominant exponentials by following the argument of `` level of intersection '' introduced in @xcite ( the main idea here is to find the dominant exponents from the graphs of @xmath227 ) .",
    "the other case corresponds to the @xmath5-matrix , @xmath542 , where @xmath543 is defined by @xmath544 with @xmath151 , the permutation given by @xmath545\\cdot[4:4n-2]\\cdots[2n:2n+2]$ ] , i.e. @xmath546 then we have :    [ multi - a ] the number of d - solitons generated by the @xmath107-function ( [ tau ] ) with @xmath4 @xmath5-matrix given by @xmath547 of ( [ jw ] ) can be any number from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , depending on the choice of the parameter @xmath361 .    here instead of giving a precise proof ,",
    "we demonstrate a case with @xmath548 : in figure [ m16:fig ] , we show the graphs of @xmath549 for @xmath550 . with a proper choice of the parameter @xmath551",
    ", one can find four different cases of intersection patterns of those lines",
    ". then d - solitons can be found at the intersection points marked by open circles in figure [ m16:fig ] , that is , the level of intersection of those points should be four ( i.e. there are four lines above those points ) . for example , d - soliton @xmath552 $ ] is obtained by the intersection of @xmath553 and @xmath554 , and two dominant exponents for this soliton are @xmath555 and @xmath556 which are obtained from four lines above the intersection point @xmath557 ( this is the definition of the level of intersection ; see @xcite for more details ) .",
