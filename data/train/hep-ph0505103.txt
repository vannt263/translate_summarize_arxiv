    "electroweak baryogenesis @xcite is an effective framework for explaining the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) .",
    "the most appealing feature of this mechanism lies in the fact that the relevant physics will soon be explored by experiments , most notably by lhc at cern and by the new generation of electric dipole measurements .",
    "it has been realized that the scenario of electroweak baryogenesis depends on extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , since two mandatory conditions are not met in the sm .",
    "the first reason is that cp - violation in the sm is marginal , such that the observed magnitude of baryon asymmetry can not be explained .",
    "secondly , the electroweak phase transition in the sm is a crossover  @xcite , leading to a too weak departure from equilibrium to be viable for baryogenesis .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) instead has all the necessary ingredients .",
    "cp violation is enhanced by adding phases to the parameters in the soft supersymmetry breaking sector , which contribute to the chargino mass matrix .",
    "furthermore , the additional bosonic degrees of freedom can lead to a strong first order phase transition as _",
    "e.g. _ in the light stop scenario  @xcite .",
    "these considerations indicate that the mssm has the potential of explaining the observed bau _ via _ electroweak baryogenesis . however , a formalism that determines the baryon asymmetry has to incorporate several features . clearly the formalism has to reflect",
    "the quantum nature of the involved particles , for cp violation is a purely quantum effect .",
    "in addition , since the sphaleron processes are only operative in the unbroken phase , the cp - violating particle densities have to be transported away from the wall into the unbroken phase to lead to a net baryon density . a formalism that can handle both of these aspects is given by the kadanoff - baym equations , which are in turn derived from the out - of - equilibrium schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "early approaches that aimed to determine cp - violating densities and have not attempted to derive transport equations from first principles have been based on the dispersion relation of the quasi - particles @xcite deduced with the wkb method . for a recent resurrection of the method see  @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was suggested that an important contribution is given by mixing effects of the quasi particles in the wall rather than from the dispersion relations in the case of a nearly degenerate mass matrix .",
    "however , in the work @xcite transport equations are not derived in a first principle approach either , but the current continuity equation is used to determine cp - violating contributions to the green functions in a perturbative approach , which are subsequently inserted as sources into classical diffusion equations derived in @xcite .",
    "these classical diffusion equations neglect oscillations of the off - diagonal elements of the green function that are important for a proper treatment of cp violation .    starting from the kadanoff - baym equations",
    ", the authors of  @xcite have derived the cp - violating semiclassical force in kinetic transport equations , which appears in fermionic kinetic equation at second order in derivatives .",
    "initially , this was done for the one fermion flavour case  @xcite and then subsequently generalized to the diagonal part of the multiflavour case  @xcite .",
    "recently this formalism was advanced to include mixing fermions  @xcite .",
    "the formalism provides an accurate description of the dynamics in the thick wall regime , which applies to particles , whose de broglie wave length is much shorter than the thickness of the phase boundary ( bubble wall ) , formally @xmath0 .",
    "one conclusion of the work @xcite is that two features of the transport equations are not captured by the procedure used in @xcite .",
    "firstly , the densities that are off - diagonal in the mass eigenbasis of the system will perform oscillations analogously to neutrino oscillations .",
    "this effect suppresses the transport of the cp - violating sources , especially if the mass spectrum in the chargino sector is far from degeneracy . secondly , while refs .",
    "@xcite used a phenomenological prescription ( fick s law ) to introduce the cp - violating sources into the diffusion transport equations , no such prescription is required in our formalism .",
    "the sources enter the diffusion transport equations with an unambiguously defined amplitude .    a first goal of this publication is to study the simpler bosonic case , and thus to rectify the conclusions of  @xcite . as a second and principal goal",
    ", we consider the chargino mediated baryogenesis in the mssm , in order to study the effects of flavour oscillations and source amplitude ambiguity on the baryon asymmetry within the framework of the reduced set of diffusion equations for charginos and quarks used in  @xcite .",
    "we also make a comparison of baryogenesis from the semiclassical force mechanism .",
    "the principal difference with respect to the previous work , is that our treatment is basis independent , while the calculations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite were performed in the mass eigenbasis .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec_bos ]",
    "we derive transport equations for mixing bosons .",
    "this is done mainly to clarify the conclusions from @xcite that are present in the bosonic case , too .",
    "in the subsequent section we discuss , how the introduction of phenomenological damping terms can lead to additional unphysical cp - violating sources . the sections",
    "[ sec_ferm ] and [ sec_diff ] state the fermionic transport equations derived in @xcite and the system of diffusion equations that is used to determine the baryon asymmetry .",
    "numerical results are presented in section [ sec_num ] , and we conclude in section [ sec_conc ] .",
    "in this section we will derive transport equations for mixing bosons from the kadanoff - baym equations and the resulting cp violating particle densities .",
    "this is a simpler analogon to the derivation for the fermionic case given in @xcite . in the fermionic case ,",
    "the spinor structure complicates the decoupling of the system of equations , but the bosonic case given here will already support the main conclusions given in @xcite without the technical issues coming from the spinor structure .",

    "however , we will keep the collision term @xmath11 , since this term usually drives the system back to equilibrium and allows to fulfill the physical boundary conditions far away from the wall .",
    "we will not explicitly calculate the collision term , but finally replace it by a phenomenological damping term .",
    "hence the kadanoff - baym equations simplify to e^-i\\{k^2 - } \\{^ < , > } = .",
    "a further simplification is to perform the calculation in the bubble wall frame .",

    "bubbles of the higgs field condensate nucleate and grow at a first order electroweak transition , and as they become large , they become approximately planar .",

    "alternatively , oscillations can be induced by the initial conditions .",
    "this is , for example , the case in neutrino oscillations .",
    "neutrinos are namely created as flavor eigenstates , and hence , from the point of view of the mass eigenbasis , a mixture of diagonal and transverse states . since in most environments",
    "the damping of neutrinos is very small , neutrino oscillations persist for a long time .",
    "let us consider again the kadanoff - baym equations  ( [ ce][ke ] ) to first order in gradients .",
    "in the last section we saw that in lowest order the spectrum can be separated into the diagonal and transverse contributions .",
    "one can show that in the first order system  ( [ ce][ke ] ) however , the different quasiparticles start to mix and the spectral functions acquire a finite width .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that , at first order in gradients , the constraint equation is not any more algebraic .",
    "fortunately we do not need any information about the spectrum to solve the kinetic equation  ( [ ke ] ) , since it does not explicitly contain any @xmath37 dependence .",

    "this transformation is in our equation ( [ kin_1 ] ) equivalent to u u^ * , ^ * .",
    "now suppose that as in the chargino case our particles do not directly couple to the sphaleron process .",
    "then the cp - violating particle density has to be communicated to the other species via interactions .",

    "these are given by [ ^ < - ^ < ] & = & + & = & and & = & + & = & , where the latter equality in both cases follows from the fact that @xmath41 is hermitian .",
    "henceforth we consider in the mass eigenbasis the equation for @xmath42 .",
    "this q - conjugation coincides with cp - conjugation on the diagonal , but it is in addition basis independent , since it commutes with the diagonalization matrix . this fact was already used in  @xcite to identify cp - violating quantities for mixing fermions before the green function was transformed to the interaction eigenbasis .",

    "the only change with respect to the original equation of @xmath32 is a sign - change in the oscillation term @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "if we include higher order terms in the gradient expansion additional q breaking terms will appear .",
    "since in leading order cp violation is based on the oscillation effect , one has to solve only the equation of the transverse parts and its q conjugate . collecting terms , that are at most first order in gradients ( deviations from equilibrium @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath44 are counted as of order one in the gradient expansion )",
    "we get for the transverse deviations , @xmath48 with the source term _ d = - k_z ^t + ^t .",
    "[ bos_src ] this can be solved numerically using an _ ansatz _ for a flow solution as described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "if we solve equations ( [ calc_equ ] ) without the collision term , we will have problems to ensure that our solution will be close to thermal equilibrium on both sides at a large distance from the wall .",
    "this problem can be solved by introducing a damping term , that corresponds to statistical effects due to the interaction of the particles with the heat bath . in the rest frame of the plasma",
    ", the damping should take place in the positive time like direction as _",

    "a reasonable choice is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 denotes the coupling strength of the dominant interaction of the species and @xmath56 is the temperature of the plasma during the phase transition .",
    "however , by introducing a term that breaks time reversal invariance , we run the risk of breaking cp explicitly by introducing new artificial cp - violating sources .",
    "we illustrate this by the following simple example .",
    "assume that a quantity @xmath57 , which denotes a cp - violating deviation from equilibrium , fulfills the equation _ z w = ( -z^2 ) n_be ( ) ( z , k_z ) and we are interested in @xmath58 .",
    "to solve this equation , we can use the green function method with the boundary condition , such that @xmath57 vanishes in the unbroken phase ( @xmath59 ) , where the wall has not yet influenced the plasma . then",

    "if the source is odd in @xmath62 , the picture changes .",
    "the equation ( [ toy_without ] ) yields a solution , that is odd in @xmath62 and @xmath58 vanishes , while the solution of ( [ toy_with ] ) gives a non - vanishing result even after integration over @xmath62 .",
    "the same effect can be seen in the kinetic equation ( [ calc_equ ] ) . without the damping term",

    "we have excluded @xmath137 dependent terms that violate cp and the limit @xmath138 is straightforward .",
    "in addition to the damping @xmath137 a breit - wigner width @xmath139 was introduced in the chargino spectrum in  @xcite .",
    "we have checked in the simpler bosonic case that , for @xmath140 , the present sources and those in  @xcite are related in a simple way .",

    "the magnitude of the source is completely specified .",
    "furthermore , we have checked that the effect of the breit - wigner broadening on our sources is small .",
    "this effect can be modeled by replacing the @xmath33-function in ( [ g0_eq ] ) by the corresponding breit - wigner form .",
    "to account for the finite @xmath139 in the transport and not just in the sources is on the same level as a treatment of the collision terms in refs .",
    "@xcite and it is outside the scope of this paper . in principle , the collision term could as well yield additional cp - violating sources , but a one - loop calculation  @xcite in a model theory of chiral fermions yukawa - coupled to scalars , indicates that the collisional sources are phase space suppressed with respect to our tree level sources .",
    "in this work we obtained the baryon asymmetry of the universe during the electroweak phase transition in the mssm using semiclassical transport equations derived in a first principle approach from the kadanoff - baym ( kb ) equations in ref .  @xcite .",
    "when the kb equations are expanded in gradients in the general case of mixing fermions , the cp - violating deviations from equilibrium can be sourced by a space - time dependent higgs background both at first and second order in gradients .",
    "the first order effects , which occur only in the presence of fermion mixing , have been consistently determined including oscillations that are crucial for the dynamics of the cp - violating densities .",
    "the second order effects are dominated by the semiclassical force  @xcite , which is the leading order source for single fermions coupled to a space - time dependent background . unlike in some alternative approaches pursued in the literature",
    ", a nice feature of the present approach is that sources and transport are treated within one formalism , which allows for an unambiguous fixing of the amplitude of cp - violating sources in ( diffusion ) transport equations .",
    "moreover , this approach allows in principle for a systematic study of cp - violating sources from collisions , and how thermal and off - shell effects may affect the sourcing and transport of cp - violating charges .",
    "furthermore , since our treatment is based on a formalism that fully includes the effects of mixing fermions , our results are manifestly basis independent .",
    "this is in contrast to former work , where the transport was treated either in mass eigenbasis  @xcite , or in flavour basis  @xcite , and which describes just transport of two physical degrees of freedom , ignoring any dynamical effects arising from flavour mixing .",
    "for example , such a treatment of neutrino propagation would lead to complete neglect of neutrino oscillations .",
    "unlike in the neutrinos case , the chargino oscillations occur on a microscopic scale given by the split in the chargino eigenvalues and by the chargino damping .",
    "in addition our formalism contains genuinely sources and transport such that no phenomenological thermalization time @xmath141 has to be introduced as was done in  @xcite .    while a broad - brush picture of the first order sources resembles the sources found in refs .",
    "@xcite ( this approach to supersymmetric baryogenesis was initiated by huet and nelson  @xcite ) , there are noteworthy differences .",
    "firstly , we found that chargino flavour oscillations are of crucial importance for identification and dynamics of the cp - violating sources .",
    "the oscillations tend to suppress the calculated baryon asymmetry , in particular in the limit of a moderate damping , a feature that was not observed in  @xcite .",
    "secondly , while broadly speaking the first order sources share similar parametric dependences with the earlier work , they do differ in some important aspects .",
    "firstly , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ plot_ma_2 ] , all of the contributions to the bau from our first order sources are of similar size , such that in the final bau one sees the characteristics of all three sources . in particular , the bau peaks at @xmath142  gev , and then dies out rather fast for large values of @xmath120 . on the other hand ,",
    "the bau obtained in  @xcite peaks at the chargino mass degeneracy , @xmath119 , it is about a factor 2 larger than in our calculation , and finally it does not diminish for large values of @xmath120 as fast as in our calculation .",
    "both discrepancies are due to the oscillations . far from degeneracy ( large mass splitting @xmath127 )",
    "the fast oscillations will suppress the particle densities .",
    "near the degeneracy ( small mass splitting @xmath127 ) cp - violation is suppressed since it is generated by the oscillations as shown in eq .",
    "( [ calc_equ ] ) and this suppression cancels the resonance in the sources observed in  @xcite .    provided it is not too strong , the phenomenological damping term that we introduce does not significantly affect the maximum strength of the first order sources , unlike what was observed in  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the second order sources are enhanced in the limit of a small damping , as shown in fig .",
    "[ plot_source ] .",
    "for example , for a moderate damping , @xmath143 , the first order sources dominate in most of the parameter space .",
    "the second order source is small , such that that it can not alone be a viable source for baryogenesis , even when the cp violation in the chargino sector is maximal .",
    "when damping is weak , @xmath144 , the second order source dominates in a large section of parameter space . for even smaller values of @xmath53",
    "the semiclassical force source alone represents a viable baryogenesis source , implying that our source is somewhat larger than what was found in ref .",
    "@xcite , which agrees quite well with the bau found in  @xcite , based on a study of semiclassical force source obtained in the mass eigenbasis  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most severe constraints on the supersymmetric baryogenesis in near future are expected from electric dipole moment ( edm ) measurements .",
    "already the current constraints on the edm of the electron  @xcite place rather strict constraints on the cp - violating phases in the chargino mass matrix , as can be seen from fig .  4 in ref .",
    "@xcite or fig .  6 in  @xcite",
    "that claims a little less restrictive bounds .",

    "nevertheless , it would be premature to claim that the mssm baryogenesis is ruled out , since the chargino mediated baryogenesis studied here does not exhaust the possibilities of the mssm .",
    "recall that neutralinos mediate baryogenesis as well , and that their contribution may be as important or even more important than that from charginos .",
    "furthermore , in the complete set of diffusion equations , there may be additional channels , which lead to baryon production , as of yet unaccounted for .",

    "the value of the electron edm could be reduced relative to the generic values used above .",
    "hence electroweak baryogenesis seems to be still possible in the mssm and in this respect we agree with the conclusion drawn in  @xcite .",
    "however , we would like to emphasis two robust and novel consequences resulting from the quantum treatment of transport in the chargino sector : the bau is strongly suppressed away from the chargino mass degeneracy and one requires even close to the degeneracy a cp - violating phase of order unity , more precisely @xmath154 .",
    "modifications of the mssm with an additional singlet ( nmssm ) also contain the prominent chargino channels .",
    "as shown in  @xcite one easily can get a strong first order phase transition and also spontaneous cp - violation at the temperature @xmath56 of the phase transition not affecting the edm at @xmath155 .",
    "this then allows for a satisfying baryon asymmetry without squeezing the ( unfortunately many ) parameters .",
    "one can also think about extensions of the mssm that not forbid @xmath156  @xcite or modifications of the standard model  @xcite , where the chargino system does not appear , but of course again quantum - transport is important .    in summary , our numerical solution to the diffusion equations  ( [ diff_q][diff_h ] )",
    "shows that a successful baryogenesis at the electroweak scale from charginos of the mssm is possible only when cp violation is quite large , and near the resonance , @xmath157 , @xmath158  gev .",
    "as long as the first order sources dominate , due to the oscillations , this picture persists also for much stronger sources , which is to be contrasted to  @xcite .",
