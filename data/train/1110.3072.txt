    "kitaev  @xcite suggested an elegant model of a one - dimensional @xmath0-wave superconducting wire , which supports majorana zero modes at the ends of the chain .",
    "kitaev s model is the fermionized version of the familiar one - dimensional transverse field ising model ( tfim ) ,  @xcite which is one of the simplest models of quantum criticality . in the fermionic representation",
    ", the well - known quantum phase transition in the model can be understood as a transition from the weak pairing bcs regime to the strong pairing bec regime .",
    "@xcite the weak - pairing phase is topologically non - trivial and in this phase the chain with open boundaries possesses a majorana fermion zero enegy mode localized at each end .",
    "it is equivalent to the ferromagnetic phase of the transverse field ising chain .",
    "the strong - pairing phase is topologically trivial and does not have any normalizable majorana fermion zero enegy modes at the ends .",
    "it corresponds to the quantum disordered phase of the transverse field ising chain .",
    "recently , there have been attempts to realize kitaev s model in one dimensional wire networks .",
    "@xcite in a realistic quantum wire , however , the range of the hybridization of the electron wave function , as well as that of cooper pairing will be of finite range and the effect of such longer ranged interactions must be addressed .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the effect of such longer ranged interactions .",
    "we do so within the context of another exactly solvable model , and find a rich phase diagram that results from such longer ranged correlations .",
    "these longer ranged interactions were considered in a previously introduced generalization of the ising model in a transverse field by extending it to contain a three spin interaction term ,  @xcite which is also exactly solved by a jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "@xcite this generalized model arises as a first step of a real space renormalization group transformation  @xcite and has a richer phase diagram .",
    "the purpose of that study was to understand how irrelevant operators can drive a system along a critical line between two different zero temperature quantum critical points .",
    "the flow of this crossover as the higher energy states are integrated out conform to the zamolodchikov s @xmath2-theorem .",
    "@xcite it is an explicit example of an exactly solved case where a system that points to a given fixed point at higher energies can asymptotically flow to a different fixed point at lower energy scales .",
    "this flow was explicitly traced in terms of a flow from higher temperature to lower temperature .",
    "the lesson learnt there was that at higher temperatures a system may be pointing to a different fixed point compared to its true fate at zero temperature .",
    "here we reexamine the ising model with a transverse field , with the added three spin interaction from the perspective of majorana zero modes .",
    "we find that the phase diagram can be classified according to the number of majorana zero modes .",
    "the fermionized version of this model corresponds to a p - wave superconductor in which the electrons have longer ranged hoppings and longer ranged harmonics of the p - wave gap function , enabling us to address the effect of such longer ranged interactions on the zero temperature phase diagram of the quantum ising chain .",
    "we find several topological phase transitions in our model , and the phases can be classified by a topological invariant of the anderson pseudospin vector  @xcite of the mean - field description of the superconducting state .",
    "this topological invariant is an integer , @xmath3 , and also specifies the number of normalizable majorana fermion zero energy modes that are localized at each end of a chain with open boundary conditions .",
    "we assess the conditions under which the topological order of the zero temperature phase diagram remains intact , and find that all phases are protected by a unitary version of time - reversal symmetry ( appropriate for spinless fermions ) : so long as this time reversal symmetry is preserved , the phases described in our work remain stable .",
    "in particular , we find that even when there are 2 majorana fermion zero modes localized at _ each _ end , separated by a lattice spacing with wave functions orthogonal to each other",
    ". once we allow breaking of time reversal invariance the topological invariant collapses to @xmath4 , which implies at most one majorana zero mode at each end of an open chain .",
    "the results of the 1d superconductor also offers insights into tfim .",
    "we find that the phase dominated by the three spin interaction has ground state degeneracy from analyzing the majorana zero modes .",
    "however , we also find that there exists a class of local spin interaction that can remove this ground state degeneracy .",
    "such impurities are time reversal breaking and it is not clear how they realize in generic circumstances .",
    "the dual  @xcite ( exchanging the site spins by the bond spins ) of the three - spin model that we study is amusingly the one - dimensional quantum @xmath1-model in a transverse magnetic field  @xcite in an enlarged parameter space than studied previously . from a complex calculation of the asymptotic form of the connected @xmath5-component of the instantaneous spin - spin correlation function",
    "it was discovered that there is an oscillatory region within the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "we find that this phenomenon of oscillation is intimately related to the oscillation of the majorana zero modes , most remarkably the oscillation wavelengths are identical , as is the exponential decay in the vicinity of the quantum critical lines .",

    "the model was previously studied only in the range @xmath127 and @xmath128 . since the ordered and the disordered phases are exchanged under duality , the disordered phase of the three - spin model is @xmath129 .",

    "this must imply that in the spectral decomposition , the majorana zero modes asymptotically dominate , although we have not yet found a rigorous proof of it .    since majorana modes of zero energy are degenerate eigenstates , a change of the number of majorana zero modes can only occur when the energy gap collapses , i.e. at a quantum phase transition . reexamining the behavior of majorana zero mode in the full parameter space",

    "so in this case , the number of majorana zero modes serve as an `` order parameter '' for the quantum phase transition .",
    "we can then distinguish phases and locate quantum phase transitions by simply transforming the hamiltonian in terms of majorana operators and finding the number of allowed majorana zero - modes at each end of the chain , which is a topologically protected quantity .",

    "the various phase boundaries described in previous sections correspond to lifshitz transitions , across which the number of fermi points change .",
    "however , as we shall see , _ not all lifshitz transitions are topological phase transitions_. to determine precisely whether a lifshitz transition is a topological phase transition , we must define an integer - valued topological invariant that changes only across a topological phase transition .",
    "it is convenient to define the invariant using the anderson pseudospin vector  @xcite @xmath146 in terms of this vector @xmath147 , where @xmath148 are pauli matrices which act in the nambu ( i.e. particle - hole ) basis of @xmath149 .",
    "it is important to highlight that the pseudospin is defined only in the @xmath150 plane in this problem .",
    "this is a consequence of time - reversal symmetry ( applied to spinless fermions , time - reversal is simply the operation of complex - conjugation ) .",
    "time - reversal symmetry ensures that the _ relative _ phase between the nearest neighbor and second neighbor pairing amplitudes must be real ( in the context of the spin model , the relative phase is identically zero ) .",
    "however , when time - reversal symmetry is broken , the relative phase between these can be an arbitrary complex number .",

    "therefore , the winding number itself is not defined ( this is consistent with the fact that this line represents a topological phase transition ) . however , for @xmath197 , the system is gapped everywhere , has a winding number @xmath192 , and possess one normalizable majorana fermion zero mode at each end of the chain .    to conclude , in this section",
    ", we have described a complementary way in which the phase transitions in this model can be understood .",
    "specifically , we have introduced the topological invariant corresponding to the winding number of the anderson pseudospin vector around the brillouin zone .",
    "each of the phase boundaries of the spin model studied in this paper corresponds to regions where the winding number is ill defined , and across each critical point , the winding number changes by an integer .",
    "the number of normalizable majorana fermion zero energy modes localized to each end of the chain at a point in the @xmath160-plane is exactly equal to the winding number at that point .",
    "we have also emphasized the point that a crossover can occur between a bec and bcs system provided that both have the same winding number ( @xmath198 ) , and we have also demonstrated that there can be topological phase transitions from one type of bcs state to another .",
    "when the phase difference between the nearest neighbor and the second neighbor pairing amplitudes is non - zero , the bdg hamiltonian takes the form @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",

    "in this paper we have studied an exactly solvable spin hamiltonian that is tfim with an added three spin interaction .",
    "while such a spin interaction may appear to be artificial to the reader , such a term is generated in real - space renormalization group treatments of tfim .",
    "@xcite therefore , it is a physically plausible coupling in a more realistic hamiltonian and corresponds to longer ranged pairing and hybridization interactions among the fermions related to the spins via a jordan - wigner transformation . by analyzing the fermionized version of this spin hamiltonian",
    "we have identified the quantum phase transitions in this system and to classify them according to the number of majorana zero modes localized at each end . this number in turn is related to the winding number of the anderson pseudospin unit vector along the one dimensional brillouin zone , so long as time - reversal symmetry for the spinless fermions is preserved . we have noted that when there are an even number of majorana fermion modes at each end , there can be a crossover from a regime where the majorana fermion wave - function decays in an oscillatory fashion ( with an exponential envelope ) to a regime where these modes decay exponentially without oscillation .",
    "interestingly , at the crossover , the entanglement entropy vanishes identically .",
    "we stress that this crossover does not occur when there are an odd number of majorana fermions at each end .",
    "whether the vanishing of the entanglement entropy is a necessary condition for this crossover remains to be understood .",
    "the degree to which such a crossover remains generic , or is ascribed to the integrability of the spin chain is unclear .",
    "finally , an interesting possibility is that such crossovers may occur in higher dimensions in spin triplet superconductors in the presence of vortices , and other topological superconductors involving non - centrosymmetric systems .",
    "we shall relegate these studies to future work ..    for unitary time reversal invariance , the topological argument involving anderson s pseudospin vector leads to winding number @xmath3 .",
    "one might wonder if higher windings beyond @xmath31 are possible as well . in principle , it is . to check",
    ", we added an even longer ranged term @xmath209 now , in addition to @xmath210 , we also get winding number @xmath211 in appropriate regimes of the parameter space from explicit calculations of the bdg equation .",
    "it is quite likely that these higher order windings are energetically punished .",
    "the situation is very similar to the @xmath1-model in two dimensions for which higher order vorticity is suppressed by the chemical potential .",
    "clearly phases with @xmath212 majorana zero modes are allowed by longer ranged hamiltonians .",
    "we find this phenomena intriguing , which deserves further attention .",
    "however , once the protection due to unitary time reversal invariance is removed the topological invariant collapses to @xmath4 , with at most one majorana zero mode at each end of an open chain .    we have previously emphasized that while the solution of the spin model is exact , the fermonized version is a mean - field description of a @xmath0-wave superconductor whose exact solution requires treatment of fluctuation effects . in a recent paper",
    "it has been shown , however , that including fluctuation effects do not change the basic picture in a one - dimensional model .",
    "@xcite whether such a conclusion holds in higher dimensions , where majorana zero modes are nucleated in the vortex cores of a @xmath213 superconductors , remains to be seen .",
    "we leave this problem for future research .",
    "an interesting question is whether or not the topological phases described here are perturbatively stable against weak interactions .",
    "we believe that they are , because they are gapped . in principle , for stronger interactions , the unitary time - reversal symmetry that protects the @xmath48 phase can break spontaneously and destabilize it .",

    "implies that if we had two majorana zero modes without the impurity , which only requires @xmath235 , we will not have any normalizable majorana zero mode due to the divergence of @xmath227 unless we have @xmath236 , which can occur only under special situations . on the other hand , if we had a single majorana zero mode without the impurity , which means @xmath237 , the majorana zero mode survives if @xmath238 .",
    "we have checked this explicitly for the special cases of @xmath239 .",
    "to consider the condition for the stability of two majorana zero mode , we first not that , in the limit where the bulk gap is large , a semi - infinite chain can be regarded as a two - state system .",
    "this is because the two majorana zero mode would form a single zero energy state , giving us energy degeneracy between the case where this zero energy state is occupied and the case where this zero energy state is vacant . due to the fermion number parity conservation",
    ", perturbation can not give rise to any off - diagonal term between the two states ; all we can obtain is the energy difference between the occupied and vacant zero energy state .",
    "therefore , an impurity term can annihilate the two majorana zero modes if the mode expansion of this impurity term gives rise to dependence on the occupancy of the zero energy state .",
    "we know that , in absence of any impurity , the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham1 ] ) gives us two majorana zero modes near @xmath240 can be written down as the linear combination of only @xmath241 s : @xmath242 where @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "then , the annihilation operator of the zero energy state can be written as @xmath245 what follows from this is that when we do the mode expansion on majorana fermions on each site , only @xmath241 s receive contribution from the zero energy state whereas all @xmath246 s do not : @xmath247 any additional fermionic bilinear terms to the hamiltonian can not affect the zero modes unless mode expansion of such terms contain @xmath248 .",
