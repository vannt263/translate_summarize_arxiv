    "it is well known ( see for instance @xcite ) that in the non - singular case i.e. , when @xmath21 , we have @xmath22 for any domain @xmath0 and that @xmath23 is never attained unless @xmath24 . in this situation , the limiting spaces after blow - up of solutions of ( [ def : equa ] ) is @xmath1 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the same result holds true for any @xmath3 as long as @xmath5 belongs to the interior of a domain .    however , the fact that things may be different when @xmath25 first emerged in a paper by egnell @xcite where he considers open cones of the form @xmath26 where the base @xmath27 is a connected domain of the unit sphere @xmath28 of @xmath1 .",
    "egnell showed that @xmath29 is then attained for @xmath3 even when @xmath30 .",
    "this obviously applies to a half - space @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the first coordinate of a generic point @xmath33 in the canonical basis of @xmath1 .",
    "half - spaces containing @xmath5 on their boundary were identified in @xcite as the limiting spaces after blow - up in the case where @xmath6 is smooth at @xmath5 , and the curvature of the boundary at @xmath5 then gets to play an important role . in our context , we specify the orientation of @xmath7 in such a way that the normal vectors of @xmath6 are pointing outward from the domain @xmath0 . it was shown in @xcite that in dimension @xmath8 , the negativity of all principal curvatures at @xmath5 which is essentially a condition of _ `` strict concavity '' _ at 0 leads to attainability of the best constant for problems with dirichlet boundary conditions , while the neumann problems required the positivity of the mean curvature at @xmath5 .",
    "on the other hand , standard pohozaev type arguments show non - attainability in the cases where @xmath0 is convex or star - shaped at @xmath5 .    in this paper , we improve and complete the results in @xcite in a substantial way by showing that for the best constant to be achieved",
    ", it is sufficient that the mean curvature be negative .",
    "this is now quite similar but dual to the case with neumann boundary conditions which requires the mean curvature to be positive .",
    "more precisely , assume that the principal curvatures @xmath34 of @xmath6 at @xmath5 are finite .",
    "the oriented boundary @xmath7 near the origin can then be represented ( up to rotating the coordinates if necessary ) by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 for some @xmath37 and where @xmath38 is the ball in @xmath1 centered at @xmath5 with radius @xmath39 .",
    "if one assumes the principal curvatures at @xmath5 to be negative , that is if @xmath40 then the sectional curvature at @xmath5 is negative and therefore @xmath41 viewed as an @xmath42-riemannian submanifold of @xmath1 is strictly convex at @xmath5 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the latter property means that there exists a neighborhood @xmath43 of @xmath5 in @xmath6 , such that the whole of @xmath43 lies on one side of a hyperplane @xmath44 that is tangent to @xmath6 at @xmath5 and @xmath45 , and so does the complementary @xmath46 , at least locally .",
    "the above curvature condition then amounts to a notion of strict local convexity of @xmath47 at @xmath5 . our main result below shows that at least for dimension greater than @xmath48",

    "in addition , the set of minimizers of ( [ def : mus ] ) is pre - compact in the @xmath52topology .",
    "the first difficulty we have to face here is that the extremals for ( [ def : mus ] ) when @xmath53 are not known explicitely , and our first result below proved in section 2 is the identification of certain symmetries enjoyed by these extremals and actually all positive solutions on half - space .",
