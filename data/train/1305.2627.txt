    "blankenbecler , brodsky and gunion therefore proposed that the power index of @xmath29 may be related to the scattering of a parton with a meson @xcite .",
    "for @xmath0 collisions at the lhc , a modified proposal with the direct meson production in the basic reaction @xmath30meson+@xmath5 has been suggested recently , involving @xmath31 active participants and @xmath32 for the power index @xcite .",

    "the other process of multiple scattering of partons in series has been examined in great detail previously @xcite .",

    "could the additional process of parton showering and hadronization affect the power index @xmath3 ?",
    "the possibility that parton showering and hadronization may influence the power index @xmath3 is revealed by the measurements of the transverse differential cross section of hadron and photon jets for @xmath34 collisions at fermilab by the cdf and d0 collaborations @xcite . in these measurements ,",

    "its transverse momentum differential cross section retains the main features of the power law of @xmath33 of the basic parton - parton hard scattering .",
    "thus , the difference between the power index of @xmath3@xmath44 - 5 from the jet transverse differential cross section and @xmath3@xmath47 from the hadron spectra is likely related to the subsequent showering and hadronization of the parton jets to hadron fragments of lower transverse momenta .",

    "( [ 49 ] ) , that is a more natural from field theory point of view involving gluon propagators , leads to a better agreement in the lower @xmath2 region .    for @xmath0 collisions at the lhc ,",
    "the above comparisons indicate that the power index extracted from hadron spectra has the value of @xmath3@xmath46 .",
    "the power index is systematically larger than the power index of @xmath3@xmath44 - 5 extracted from jet transverse differential cross sections .",
    "considering the difference of a jet and hadrons , we can infer that the process of fragmentation and showering increases the value of the power index @xmath3 of the transverse spectra .    it should be noted that the hard - scattering model results in the low-@xmath2 region will be slightly modified with the introduction of the intrinsic @xmath2 of the partons @xcite .",
    "there will also be modifications due to the recombination of partons @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the extrapolation of the hard - scattering results to the low-@xmath2 region as obtained here indicates indeed that the hard - scattering process can contribute substantially to the production of particles at the low-@xmath2 region the normalization of the rapidity distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ 50 ] ) depends on @xmath5 . ] as has been suggested by trainor and collaborators @xcite .",
    "we have been stimulated by the good agreement of the tsallis distribution with the transverse momentum distribution of produced hadrons over a large range of the transverse memorandum in @xmath0 collisions at lhc energies .",
    "the simplicity of the tsallis distributions raises questions on the physical meaning of the few degrees of freedom entering into the tsallis distribution .",
    "as the magnitude of the transverse momentum in this high-@xmath2 region is much greater than the mean transverse momentum , concepts such as statistical mechanics that depend on thermodynamical equilibrium or quasiequilibrium may be subject to question .",
    "the asymmetry between the transverse and the longitudinal degrees of freedom also poses additional difficulties in a statistical explanation of the full three - dimensional momentum distribution in this high-@xmath2 region .",
    "we therefore attempt to understand the results of simple tsallis fit of the transverse momentum distribution in @xmath0 collisions within the relativistic hard - scattering model .",
    "the relativistic hard - scattering model however predicts that the differential cross section for the production of high-@xmath2 particles should vary as @xmath1 with @xmath25 if the basic process consists of elementary parton - parton @xmath23 processes .",
    "the tsallis fit to the lhc data gives a power index for hadrons of @xmath3@xmath47 that is substantially greater .",
    "our reexamination of the relativistic hard - scattering model reveals that for minimum biased events without a centrality selection , the differential cross section at high @xmath2 is dominated by the contribution from a single parton - parton collision with the @xmath229 behavior .",
    "the multiple scattering process leads to contributions of higher power indices that will not modify significantly the @xmath229 behavior at high @xmath2",
    ". the power index @xmath3 should be approximately 4 + 1/2 where the additional power of 1/2 arises from the integration of the structure function .",
    "indeed , comparison with the experimental power indices in the transverse differential cross sections for jet production supports the approximate validity of a basic @xmath229 behavior for parton - parton collisions in relativistic hard - scattering processes .    as a hadron jet or",
    "a photon jet corresponds to the state of a parton after a parton - parton collision but before the final - state showering , we now understand that the systematic difference between the power index of @xmath3@xmath44 - 5 for jets @xcite , and @xmath3@xmath46 - 7 for hadrons @xcite may be attributed to the subsequent showering and hadronization of the parton jet to hadron fragments of lower transverse momenta .",
    "another part of the increase of the power index arises from the @xmath2 dependence of the structure function factor @xmath230 and the running coupling constant .",
    "while we examine here the contributions of the hard processes , there can also be contributions of the produced particles from soft processes in the low-@xmath2 region .",
    "these contributions relative to those from hard processes will certainly diminish as the collision energy increases .",
    "it is therefore entirely possible that the borderline between soft and hard processes moves to the lower @xmath2 region as the collision energy increases .",
    "how the borderline between the two processes can be determined will require much more future work .",
    "many relevant questions on the borderline between the high-@xmath2 and the low-@xmath2 regions will need to be settled in the future .",
    "first , it is expected that hard - scattering processes will be accompanied by collisional correlations different from those from soft processes .",
    "a careful analysis of the two - particle correlations in the low-@xmath2 region may provide a way of separating out the soft process contributions from the hard - scattering collisional contributions in the low-@xmath2 region @xcite .",
    "second , while we apply the relativistic hard - scattering model to the low-@xmath2 region of @xmath231 gev / c , the approximations we have used may not have its range of validity down to such regions .",
    "the establishment of the low-@xmath2 limit of validity of the relativistic hard - scattering model will be both an experimental and theoretical question .",
    "processes such as parton intrinsic transverse momentum @xcite and parton recombination @xcite will add complexity to the transverse momentum distribution in the low-@xmath2 region .",
    "third , the separation of the soft process contribution and the knowledge of the borderline between the soft processes and the hard processes may also provide information whether the basic collision law should be represented by a linear form of @xmath226 in eq .",
    "( [ 43 ] ) or a quadratic form of @xmath228 in eq .",
    "( [ 49 ] ) .",
    "the low-@xmath2 region is conventionally associated with soft nonperturbative processes and the high-@xmath2 region with perturbative hard - scattering processes . a very different two - component model ( tcm )",
    "scheme for partitioning the soft and hard components has been proposed @xcite .",
    "measurements of the star collaboration @xcite on the transverse distribution @xmath232 around @xmath233@xmath40 , as a function of the event multiplicity classes , reveal that the distribution @xmath232 can be approximately written as the sum of a term linear in multiplicity , @xmath234 , and a term quadratic in multiplicity , @xmath235 @xcite . under the hypothesis that the multiplicity of hard collisions @xmath236 is proportional to @xmath237 while the multiplicity of soft collisions @xmath238 is linear in @xmath239 , the @xmath240 contribution , parametrized in the levy form or the equivalent tsallis form as a function of @xmath2 , @xmath240@xmath4@xmath241^n$ ] ,",
    "is identified in the tcm scheme as the tcm  soft \" component , and the @xmath242 contribution , parametrized as a gaussian in shifted @xmath243 $ ] , is identified as the tcm  hard \" component @xcite . as a result of such a partition , the tcm soft component remains significant even at very high @xmath2 and contains a power law @xmath1 behavior , which however occurs only in the conventional hard component of relativistic hard - scattering model . on the other hand ,",
    "the tcm hard component is a gaussian distribution in shifted @xmath244 centered at @xmath245 gev and it does not have the power - law behavior of relativistic hard scattering model at high @xmath2 .",
    "the tcm partitions are in variance with those in our physical , and conventional partitions .",
    "furthermore , from physical arguments , one expects that the multiplicity of relativistic hard - scattering collisions @xmath246 need not be related to the square of the multiplicity of soft collisions @xmath247 , and the soft and hard processes contribute in different regions of @xmath2 .",
    "constraining @xmath246 to be proportional to @xmath247 in the partition may lead to a distortion of the spectrum of tcm components .",
    "as there are many different ways of partitioning the spectrum , the theoretical , physical , and mathematical basis for the two - component model partition in the form as presented as soft and hard in @xcite may need to be further investigated .",
    "returning to the tsallis distribution which motivates the present investigation , we can conclude that the successes of representing the transverse spectra at high-@xmath2 by a tsallis distribution arise from ( i ) the simple power - law behavior of the parton - parton scattering cross section , @xmath229 , with a power index of @xmath248 , and ( ii ) the few number of the degrees of freedom in the hard - scattering model .",
    "the power index of 4 has been found experimentally to be approximately valid by examining the differential cross sections of hadron jets and photon jets .",
    "it has also been found theoretically to be approximately valid by examining the multiple scattering process .",
    "the power index is not significantly modified by the multiple scattering process in minimum biased measurements .",
    "the @xmath179 power law lays the foundation for tsallis / hegedorn - type transverse momentum distributions , and the few degrees of freedom in the tsallis distribution is a reflection the few degrees of freedom in the underlying hard - scattering model .",
    "there are additional @xmath2 dependence due to the parton structure function , the running coupling constant , and the parton momentum integration , which lead to a slightly larger power index .",
    "furthermore , in going from the parton measurements in terms of jets to hadron measurements in terms of fragmented hadron products , there are additional showering and fragmentation processes which give rise to a greater value of the power index .",
    "the tsallis distribution is flexible enough to adjust the power index to accommodate the different and changing environment , yielding a nonstatistical description of the distribution .    because of its nonstatistical nature",
    ", the parameters in a tsallis distribution can only be supplied and suggested from nonstatistical means , such as the qcd basic parton - parton scattering power index and the qcd multiple scattering shadowing effects .",
    "it also is limited in its application to the transverse degree of freedom , as there is no way to generalize the tsallis parameters across the three - dimensional space from transverse to longitudinal coordinates . for a more fundamental description ,",
    "it is necessary to turn to the basic parton model for answers .",
    "for example , the relativistic hard scattering model can be applied to collision to other longitudinal regions of pseudorapidities where in the forward rapidity region , the additional mechanism of direct fragmentation @xcite should also be included .",
    "the underlying relativistic hard - scattering model has a greater range of applications and a stronger theoretical foundation .",
