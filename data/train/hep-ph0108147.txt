    "the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) has reported an epochal measurement  @xcite of the rate of charged current interactions in deuterium due to @xmath5b solar neutrinos .",
    "the precise super - kamiokande measurement  @xcite of neutrino - electron scattering ( charged plus some neutral current sensitivity ) by @xmath5b neutrinos reveals a total neutrino flux that is about @xmath7  @xcite larger than the @xmath8 flux measured by sno .",
    "the combined sno and super - kamiokande result seems to have convinced most physicists that neutrino oscillations are occuring in the solar neutrino domain .    why is a single @xmath9 result so convincing ?",
    "we all know of examples in particle and nuclear physics where three sigma results have not been verified .",
    "the purpose of this paper is quantify the role of the additional information on solar neutrino event rates that , when taken together with the sno / super - kamiokande result , makes the inference of neutrino oscillations so compelling .",
    "i will not discuss the precise helioseismological verification , better than @xmath10% r.m.s . throughout the sun , of the sound speeds predicted by the standard solar model  @xcite ( hereafter , bp2000 ) .",
    "i will also not discuss non - quantifiable effects such as the manifestly great care with which both the sno and super - kamiokande experiments were performed .",
    "the excellent agreement between the standard solar model predictions and the helioseismological measurements and the rigourous calibrations of the sno and super - kamiokande experiments are undoubtedly important factors in convincing many in the physics community that solar neutrino oscillations occur , but i will focus here only on the measurements of solar neutrino event rates in different detectors .",
    "suppose we allow the solar neutrino fluxes to have arbitrary ( positive ) amplitudes , subject only to the conditions that the fusion energy associated with these fluxes equals the precisely measured solar luminosity and that the energy spectra are undistorted by neutrino oscillations .",
    "if the minimal standard electroweak model is valid ( no neutrino oscillations occur ) , solar neutrino energy spectra differ from their laboratory shapes by of order one part in @xmath11 for beta - decays ( like @xmath5b or @xmath12n decay ) and less than one part in @xmath13 for the @xmath14 reaction(one part in @xmath15 for the @xmath16 reaction )  @xcite .",
    "suppose we ignore all other information about the sun , including helioseismology .",
    "how well can we then fit the observed set of solar neutrino event rates in different experiments ?",
    "i report here on a simultaneous fit with arbitrary neutrino fluxes to all the available neutrino event rates , chlorine  @xcite , kamiokande  @xcite , sage  @xcite , gallex + gno  @xcite , super - kamiokande  @xcite , and sno  @xcite .",

    "if the temperature scaling of the nuclear reactions giving rise to @xmath4be and @xmath5b neutrinos is imposed as an additional condition on the fitting procedure , then the no - oscillation hypothesis is rejected at the @xmath6 level ( compared to @xmath18 in the pre - sno era ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "i also provide a physical explanation of why the @xmath19 method leads to the unphysical requirement that some solar neutrino fluxes(@xmath4be , @xmath12n , and @xmath20o ) be completely absent while the @xmath14 neutrino flux is enhanced over the standard solar model prediction .",

    "the seminal studies in the mid 1990s by hata , bludman , and langacker  @xcite , parke  @xcite , and heeger and robinson  @xcite , and related discussions  @xcite , helped convince many physicists of the necessity of solar neutrino oscillations .",

    "two new results on the quality of fits to solar neutrino data are presented in this paper .",
    "first , if all six of the solar neutrino experiments ( sno , chlorine , kamiokande , sage , gallex , and super - kamiokande ) are included in the fit , the formal statistical level at which the fit is unsatisfactory rises to @xmath88 ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "second , if the temperature scaling of the fusion reactions producing the @xmath4be and @xmath5b solar neutrinos are taken into account , then the failure of the fitting procedure is at the enormously high @xmath6 level ( the formal value of @xmath46 is ridiculously small ) .    to achieve",
    "even the unsatisfactory fits described in table  [ tab : sigmas ] , the @xmath19 solutions require that the @xmath4be , @xmath12n , and @xmath20o neutrinos be entirely missing .",
    "section  [ sec : whymissing ] describes the physical reasons leading to this unphysical effect .",
    "since the formal best - fits are achieved at the expense of eliminating the @xmath4be , @xmath12n , and @xmath20o neutrinos , we should really regard the ( improbable ) solutions found here as even more unlikely because of their physical implausibility .",
