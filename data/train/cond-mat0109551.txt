    "the combined influence of quenched disorder and interactions in electronic systems remains one of the great unsolved problems in today s condensed matter physics . already disorder or interactions alone",
    "lead to a variety of novel and intriguing physical phenomena like anderson localization or the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition . neither the disorder nor the interaction problem can be considered completely understood today .",
    "if both disorder and interactions are simultaneously present the behavior becomes even more complex .",
    "a comparatively thorough understanding has been achieved for systems with weak disorder and weak interactions in three spatial dimensions which can be analyzed using conventional perturbative methods ( lee and ramakrishnan 1985 ) .",
    "the leading low - temperature behavior in these systems is not influenced by the interactions : the electrons form a dirty fermi liquid ( belitz and kirkpatrick 1999 ) , a generalization of landau s fermi liquid concept to the disordered case . at low temperatures , this implies a specific heat which is linear in the temperature , a finite conductivity and a finite single - particle density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "however , the leading corrections to the fermi liquid theory already show nontrivial nonanalytic behavior due to the presence of both disorder and interactions .",
    "these corrections which are sometimes called altshuler - aronov singularities ( altshuler and aronov 1985 ) are , e.g. , square - root singularities in the density of states at the fermi energy and in the temperature or frequency dependence of the conductivity . this behavior has also been observed experimentally in a variety of systems . based on these weak coupling results a quantum field theory",
    "was developed and analyzed by means of renormalization group methods ( finkelstein 1983 , belitz and kirkpatrick 1994 ) .",
    "this lead to a classification of the soft modes in a disordered interacting electron system and the resulting identification of different universality classes for the metal - insulator transition ( belitz and kirkpatrick 1994 ) .    in two dimensions",
    "the situation is less clear even for weak disorder and interactions .",
    "perturbative methods analogous to those used in three dimensions predict that non - interacting electrons are always localized , and a metallic phase is impossible . in the presence of interactions ( and",
    "if additional symmetry - breaking terms are absent ) the renormalization group seems to predict an unconventional non - fermi liquid metallic state characterized by zero disorder but strong correlations ( finkelstein 1983 ) .",
    "however , this prediction was based on an extrapolation of the renormalization group beyond its region of validity .",
    "therefore , it was widely believed that a two - dimensional dirty electron system is generically insulating . in recent years",
    "the two - dimensional case has attracted renewed attention because experiments on si - mosfets ( kravchenko _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , kravchenko _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) and other systems with very low electron density show signatures of a metal - insulator transition , in contradiction to the orthodox theory . up to now",
    "this transition , if any , is not understood . in a number of theories new quantum states of matter have been postulated , either non - fermi liquid metals ( castellani _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , si and varma 1998 , benenti _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 , chakravarty _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 , denteneer _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) or unusual superconductors ( zhang and rice 1997 , belitz and kirkpatrick 1998 , philips _",
    ". however , other explanations like temperature - dependent disorder ( altshuler and maslov 1999 ) or impurity screening ( gold and dolgopolov 1986 , das sarma and hwang 1999 , klapwijk and das sarma 1999 ) are more in line with the orthodox view .",
    "they imply that the seeming mit is a transient phenomenon , and the true ground state is always an insulator .",
    "most of the theoretical work discussed above is concerned with the metallic phase and with approaching the metal - insulator transition from the metallic side . to a large extent independently , the behavior of interacting disordered electrons in the localized regime has been investigated for more than 30 years .",
    "pollak ( 1970 ) suggested that the coulomb interaction leads to a reduction of the single - particle density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "efros and shklovskii ( 1975 ) derived an approximate expression for the density of states in this soft gap which they called the coulomb gap .",
    "later , a large amount of research went into the question , how hopping transport in the localized regime is influenced by the coulomb interaction ( see , e.g. the review articles in efros and pollak ( 1985 ) ) . despite these efforts ,",
    "the problem can not be considered completely solved .",
    "the interest in the interplay between anderson localization and interactions resurged with the work of shepelyansky ( 1994 ) on the localization of just two interacting particles .",
    "he suggested that even for a repulsive interaction the two particles can form a pair whose localization length is much larger than that of a single particle .",
    "by now it is established , that such an enhancement of the localization length indeed exists , even though the precise dependence of the pair localization length on disorder and interaction strength has not been conclusively determined yet ( rmer _ et al .",
    "however , the experimentally more significant case is a finite electron density in the thermodynamic limit as opposed to just two particles . since a systematic analytic approach to the insulating phase of a disordered electron system",
    "does not exist , most of the work on this problem has relied on numerical methods , e.g. , the density - matrix renormalization group in one - dimensional systems ( schmitteckert _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) and exact or semi - exact diagonalization methods in higher dimensions ( berkovits and avishai 1996 , berkovits _",
    "2001 ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the transport and localization properties of disordered interacting electrons in the localized regime using the hartree - fock based diagonalization method ( vojta _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , an effective numerical method for disordered many - particle systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : ccg ]",
    "we introduce the generic model for the description of disordered interacting electrons in the extremely localized limit , the classical coulomb glass , and discuss its basic properties . in section [ sec : qcg ]",
    "we introduce quantum hopping and spin degrees of freedom into the model .",
    "the resulting quantum coulomb glass and its spin generalization are the prototypical models for disordered electrons in the insulating phase .",
    "section [ sec : hfd ] is devoted to explaining our numerical method , the hartree - fock based diagonalization .",
    "we present and discuss our results on transport and localization in section [ sec : res ] .",
    "in the extremely localized or classical limit the kinetic energy of the electrons can be neglected compared to the potential energy and the electron - electron interaction . in a doped semiconductor",
    "this corresponds , e.g. , to a vanishing concentration of donors or acceptors . in this limit",
    "the electrons behave like classical point charges , and the spin degrees of freedom do not play any role . the generic model for this regime",
    "is the classical coulomb glass model ( efros and shklovskii 1975 ) which consists of classical point charges in a random potential which interact via coulomb interaction .",
    "the model is defined on a regular hypercubic lattice with one state on each of its @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the spatial dimensionality ) sites .",
    "the system is occupied by @xmath2 spinless fermions ( @xmath3 ) . to ensure charge neutrality",
    "each lattice site carries a compensating positive charge of @xmath4 .",
    "the hamiltonian of this classical coulomb glass reads @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the occupation number of site @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the chemical potential .",
    "the coulomb interaction @xmath9 remains long - ranged since screening breaks down in the insulating phase .",
    "we parametrize the interaction by its nearest - neighbor value @xmath10 .",
    "the boundary conditions are periodic and the interaction is treated in the minimum image convention ( which implies a cut - off at a distance of @xmath11 ) .",
    "the random potential values @xmath12 are chosen independently from a box distribution of width @xmath13 and zero mean . in the following we set the disorder strength @xmath14 to 1 which fixes the energy scale .",
    "one of the most important properties of the classical coulomb glass is the reduction of the single - particle density of states at the fermi energy @xmath15 ( pollak 1970 ) .",
    "this soft coulomb gap is of the form ( efros and shklovskii 1975 ) @xmath16 using a self - consistent equation of mean - field type the exponent was determined to be @xmath17 to be 1 in two dimensions and 2 in three dimensions .",
    "numerical simulations usually give slightly larger values ( mbius _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) , the latest being 1.7 for 2d and 2.7 for 3d ( sarvestani _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) .",
    "many - particle excitations like particle - hole excitations have weaker gaps or no gap at all .",
    "the influence of these gaps on the transport properties of the classical coulomb glass has been the subject of a long controversy .",
    "since the electrons are localized , transport must occur via hopping .",
    "efros and shklovskii generalized mott s variable - range hopping theory ( mott 1968 ) to cases with a non - constant single - particle density of states .",
    "according to this theory the conductivity varies like @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "while this behavior is indeed observed in many relevant systems , the quantitative values for hopping distance and energy often do not work out .",
    "the above theory was criticised by pollak ( for reviews see efros and pollak 1985 , pollak 1992 ) for essentially being a single - particle transport theory .",
    "such a theory should not be adequate in an interacting system since the excitations responsible for transport are particle - hole or more complex excitations which do not have such a strong coulomb gap .",
    "so far no completely satisfactory theory has been developed .",
    "we will show in section [ sec : res ] that similar phenomena also exist for quantum transport : single - particle and particle - hole excitations can have very different localization properties .",
    "if the electrons are not completely localized , each at one impurity site , anymore , the overlap between states at different sites can not be neglected even if the system is still in the insulating phase . to describe this regime ,",
    "we add a kinetic energy , i.e. quantum hopping matrix elements of strength @xmath19 between nearest neighbors , to the hamiltonian : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the fermion creation and annihilation operators at site @xmath7 , respectively , and the sum runs over all pairs of nearest neighbor sites .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are also used for the hopping part of the hamiltonian . in the limit",
    "@xmath23 the model ( [ eq : qcg ] ) reduces to the classical coulomb glass , for vanishing coulomb interaction but finite overlap it reduces to the usual anderson model of localization . the model defined in ( [ eq : qcg ] )",
    "is often called the quantum coulomb glass ( efros and pikus 1995 , talamantes _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , epperlein _ et al .",
    ".    however , in the presence of quantum hopping the spin - degrees of freedom of the electrons can not simply be neglected , and using the quantum coulomb glass hamiltonian ( [ eq : qcg ] ) involves an uncontrolled approximation . even in the insulating phase , a complete description of disordered interacting electrons therefore requires a generalization of the quantum coulomb glass model to electrons with spin .",
    "we again consider a hypercubic lattice with @xmath0 sites , now with two states ( spin up and down ) per site .",
    "the system contains @xmath24 electrons ( @xmath3 ) and has a compensating positive charge of @xmath25 on each lattice site .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the creation , annihilation and occupation number operators for electrons at site @xmath7 with spin @xmath30 .",
    "two electrons on the same site interact via a hubbard interaction @xmath31 .",
    "the simulation of a disordered quantum many - particle system like the quantum coulomb glass or its spin generalization poses formidable problems for any numerical approach . on the one hand",
    ", the dimension of the many - particle hilbert space grows exponentially with the system size , restricting the simulation to very small sizes even for clean many - particle systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of disorder requires the simulation of many samples with different disorder configurations in order to obtain averages or typical values of physical quantities .",
    "the problem is even more severe when non - self - averaging quantities like the conductance are considered . here",
    "one should in principle study the entire distribution function of an observable instead of just one characteristic value . in the case of the quantum coulomb glass , an additional complication is produced by the long - range character of the coulomb interaction which has to be retained , at least for a correct description of the insulating phase .    in the literature ,",
    "several different methods have been used to study the quantum coulomb glass and related problems .",
    "however , most of them are hampered by severe problems .",
    "exact diagonalization ( dagotto 1994 , epperlein _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) works only for very small systems ( with up to about @xmath32 lattice sites for electrons with spin ) . for one - dimensional systems the density - matrix renormalization group method ( white 1998 )",
    "is a very efficient tool to obtain the low - energy properties .",
    "it is , however , less effective in higher dimensions ; and it is also not capable of handling the long - range coulomb interaction which is important in the insulating phase .",
    "quantum monte - carlo methods ( von der linden 1992 ) are another means of simulating disordered many - particle systems .",
    "they are very effective for bosons at finite temperatures .",
    "very low temperatures are , however , hard to reach .",
    "moreover , simulations of fermions suffer from the notorious sign problem ( although this turned out to be less severe in the presence of disorder ) .",
    "in this paper we use two different numerical methods to investigate the quantum coulomb glass . for the calculation of static properties like",
    "the single - particle density of states we use a disordered - hartree - fock approximation ( epperlein _ et al .",
    "we decouple the coulomb and hubbard interaction terms in the hamiltonian following the recipe @xmath33 .",
    "the resulting disordered single - particle hamiltonian is diagonalized numerically in a self - consistency cycle , until convergence is reached for the expectation values @xmath34 with respect to the ground state .",
    "this calculation results in an orthonormal set of single - particle hartree - fock states .",
    "although decoupling the interaction terms involves an uncontrolled approximation the method gives reasonable results for the density of states , as we have shown by comparison with exact diagonalization ( epperlein _ et al .",
    "its main advantage is that comparatively large systems of several thousand sites can be handled , because effectively only a single - particle problem has to be solved .    for quantities defined by time correlation functions like the conductance",
    "the hartree - fock approximation gives very poor results ( epperlein _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) . in recent years",
    "we have therefore developed and used an alternative method .",
    "it improves the hartree - fock approximation by diagonalizing the many - particle hamiltonian in the subspace of the hilbert space spanned by the low - energy slater states calculated in the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "this method , the hartree - fock based diagonalization ( hfd ) , is analogous to the quantum - chemical configuration interaction ( see , e.g. , fulde 1995 ) approach but adapted for disordered lattice models .",
    "the hfd method consists of 3 steps , which have to be carried out separately for each disorder configuration considered : ( i ) solve the hartree - fock approximation of the hamiltonian , as discussed above , which gives a set of single - particle hartree - fock states .",
    "( ii ) construct many - particle slater determinants from these states , and use a monte - carlo algorithm based on thermal cycling ( mbius _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) to find a certain number @xmath35 of the lowest - in - energy slater states .",
    "( iii ) transform the hamiltonian and the observables to the basis formed by these slater states and diagonalize the hamiltonian in the hilbert space they span .",
    "calculate the observables .",
    "the efficiency of the hfd method is due to the fact that the hartree - fock states are comparatively close in character to the exact eigenstates in the entire parameter space , as we have shown in comprehensive test runs .",
    "thus the method works well for all parameters while related methods based on non - interacting or classical eigenstates ( efros and pikus 1995 , talamantes _",
    "1996 ) instead of hartree - fock states are restricted to small parameter regions .",
    "we have carried out extensive tests of the method and investigated how the quality of the results depends on the dimension of the restricted hilbert space ( i.e. , the number of slater states ) used in step ( iii ) ( vojta _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) . for a relatively small system of 16 sites and 8 spinless fermions we compared the hfd to exact diagonalization results .",
    "we found that already a basis size of @xmath36 slater states ( the total dimension of the hilbert space is 12870 in this case ) yields the ground state energy with an relative error less than @xmath37 and the respective occupation numbers with an error less than @xmath38 . for larger systems we checked the convergence by systematically increasing @xmath35 until the results did not change within the desired accuracy . for systems with up to 64 sites we estimated that a few hundred to 2000 slater states are sufficient for the questions studied here .",
    "in our previous work we have already investigated the transport properties of spinless fermions in one ( schreiber _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , two ( vojta _ et al . _",
    "1998b ) and three ( vojta and epperlein 1998 ) dimensions in some detail . here",
    "we concentrate on the generalized quantum coulomb glass with spin degrees of freedom in two dimensions .",
    "the presence of the spin degrees of freedom strongly increases the dimension of the hilbert space . therefore , for most production runs we have studied systems of @xmath39 sites .",
    "the numerical effort is equivalent to that for a system of 32 sites in the case of spinless fermions .",
    "we first investigate the conductance which is the most accessible observable in a real transport experiment .",
    "theoretically , it can be obtained from linear - response theory .",
    "it is essentially determined by the current - current correlation function of the ground state .",
    "the real ( dissipative ) part of the conductance ( in units of @xmath40 ) at frequency @xmath41 is given by the kubo - greenwood formula ( kubo 1957 , greenwood 1958 ) , @xmath42 @xmath43 is the @xmath44 component of the current operator and @xmath45 is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian .",
    "equation ( [ eq : kubo ] ) describes an isolated system while in a realistic d.c .",
    "transport experiment the sample is connected to contacts and leads .",
    "this results in a finite life time @xmath46 of the eigenstates leading to an inhomogeneous broadening @xmath47 of the @xmath48 functions in ( [ eq : kubo ] ) ( datta 1997 ) . to suppress the discreteness of the spectrum of a finite system",
    ", @xmath49 should be at least of the order of the single - particle level spacing . in our still comparatively small systems",
    "this requires large @xmath50 .",
    "we tested different @xmath49 and found that the conductance _",
    "depend on @xmath49 but the qualitative results do not .",
    "figure [ fig : conductance ] shows the typical conductance values of a system of @xmath32 lattice sites at half filling as a function of the interaction @xmath10 for different hopping matrix elements @xmath19 .",
    "panel ( a ) shows results for an occupation of 8 spin - up and 8 spin - down electrons while panel ( b ) is for 8 spinless fermions . since the logarithm of the conductance rather than the conductance itself is a self - averaging quantity in a disordered system , we calculate the typical conductance by averaging the logarithms of the conductances of 1000 ( 400 in the spinless case ) disorder configurations .",
    "both graphs show the same qualitative behavior : for large kinetic energy @xmath19 the interactions always reduce the d.c .",
    "conductance , while for small @xmath19 , i.e. in the localized regime , small and moderate interactions significantly enhance the d.c .",
    "conductance . for larger interaction strength",
    "the conductance drops , indicating the crossover to a wigner crystal or wigner glass .",
    "a closer comparison of the cases with and without spin reveals a number of interesting similarities and differences . without interactions ( @xmath51 )",
    "the conductance of the spinless fermions is exactly half of that of the electrons with spin .",
    "this just reflects the fact that at zero interactions spin - up and spin - down electrons decouple .",
    "the contributions of these two subsystems to the conductance are identical and identical to that of spinless fermions . with increasing interaction the conductance increases faster for electrons than for spinless fermions , but it also falls off faster .",
    "one possible reason is that in the case with spin there is twice as much charge in the system as in the spinless case , and thus effectively the coulomb interaction is twice as strong . to explore this",
    "we directly compare the two results in figure [ fig : compare ] after rescaling the conductance of the electron system by 1/2 and the interaction strength by 2 .",
    "the two sets of curves nicely fall on top of each other within the statistical accuracy .",
    "therefore we conclude that for the systems considered the coulomb interaction plays the essential role for the delocalizing tendency for weak interactions as well as for the localizing tendency for strong interactions .",
    "the spin degrees of freedom do not seem to be important .",
    "we now turn to the single - particle localization properties . in the case of non - interacting electrons",
    "they can be characterized by the inverse participation number of the single - particle states with respect to the site basis states .",
    "this quantity is identical to the return probability of the single - particle excitations ( economu and cohen 1970 ) , @xmath52 here @xmath53 are the retarded and advanced single - particle greens functions .",
    "in contrast to the single - particle participation number the return probability is also well defined for interacting systems ( vojta _ et al . _",
    "1998a ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : return ] we show the return probability as a function of the interaction strength for different hopping matrix elements @xmath19 .",
    "its behavior is very similar to that of the conductance . for large kinetic energy",
    "@xmath19 the interactions always increase the return probability , i.e. they lead to stronger localization . for small @xmath19 ,",
    "small and moderate interactions significantly decrease the return probability and thus lead to weaker localization",
    ".    however , in an interacting system the return probability ( [ eq : return ] ) entangles localization and decay information , since @xmath54 is decreased from 1 not only by delocalization but also by decay of the quasi - particles . in order to extract the decay of the quasi - particles we consider the survival probability @xmath55 which sums the transmission probabilities of a single - particle excitation to all sites .",
    "the survival probability at the fermi energy is related to the square of the quasiparticle weight .",
    "our results for the survival probability are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quasi ] . for non - interacting electrons @xmath56 by definition since single - particle excitations do not decay .",
    "weak interactions lead to a reduced survival probability but for stronger interactions it approaches 1 again .    in order to extract the localization information from the return probability , we normalize @xmath54 by @xmath57 .",
    "the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : ret_norm ] show that , in general , interactions tend to localize the _ single - particle _ excitations .",
    "the delocalization at low interaction strength and small kinetic energy is only a tiny effect .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier results ( epperlein _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) based on the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "the reason for the strong single - particle localization is the coulomb gap in the _ single - particle _ density of states which effectively reduces the overlap between excitations close to the fermi level .    for comparison",
    "we also calculate the inverse participation number of the many - particle ground state with respect to the hartree - fock slater determinants .",
    "this quantity measures , to what extent the interactions introduce non - trivial correlations ( beyond the hartree - fock level ) into the system .",
    "conceptually , it is therefore similar to the survival probability ( [ eq : survive ] ) .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fockpn ] . for @xmath51",
    "the fock space participation number is 1 by definition because the hartree - fock approximation is exact for non - interacting electrons .",
    "increasing the interaction mixes the single - particle states , and the inverse fock space participation number is reduced . for large interaction",
    "the eigenstates become again more localized in fock space .",
    "finally , for @xmath58 the hartree - fock approximation becomes exact , and the inverse fock space participation number approaches 1 again .",
    "the delocalization in fock space roughly occurs in the same parameter region where the conductance is enhanced by interactions .",
    "in this paper we have studied the transport and localization properties of interacting spinless fermions and electrons in a random potential .",
    "the numerical calculations have been carried out by means of the hartree - fock based diagonalization method .",
    "our results for the influence of interactions on the conductance , viz . a localizing tendency in the diffusive regime and a delocalizing tendency deep in the insulating regime , are in qualitative agreement with a number of other studies in one and two dimensions .",
    "we do not see any indications for a true metal - insulator transition in the systems considered . of course",
    ", new phenomena could develop at significantly larger length scales .",
    "however , the energy scale for the 2d mit observed experimentally in the si - mosfets is the fermi energy rather than some additional low - energy scale .",
    "therefore one would expect to see signatures of this transition already at small length scales .",
    "we have paid particular attention to the spin degrees of freedom . to this end",
    "we have compared the conductance values of spinless fermions and electrons , both systems being at half filling .",
    "we have found that the interaction dependence of the conductance is much stronger for electrons than for spinless fermions .",
    "however , this stronger dependence can simply be accounted for by rescaling the coulomb interaction strength by 2 .",
    "therefore , spin phenomena do not seem to play an essential role here , in contrast to the experiments in si - mosfets where an in - plane magnetic field ( which does not couple to the orbital motion of the electrons ) strongly suppresses the conducting phase ( popovich _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 , simonian _",
    "1997 ) .",
    "in addition to the conductance we have studied the localization of single - particle excitations , which we have characterized by the normalized return probability , i.e. the return probability divided by the square of the quasiparticle weight .",
    "single - particle excitations generally tend to become more localized under the influence of the interactions .",
    "the reason for the strong single - particle localization is the coulomb gap in the _ single - particle _ density of states which effectively reduces the overlap between excitations close to the fermi level .",
    "in contrast , the particle - hole excitations responsible for the conductance do not have a coulomb gap , and thus they show a tendency towards delocalization at low interaction strength and small kinetic energy .",

    "<S> we consider the combined influence of disorder , electron - electron interactions and quantum hopping on the properties of electronic systems in a localized phase , approaching an insulator - metal transition . </S>",
    "<S> the generic models in this regime are the quantum coulomb glass and its generalization to electrons with spin . after introducing these models </S>",
    "<S> we explain our computational method , the hartree - fock based diagonalization . </S>",
    "<S> we then discuss the conductance and compare spinless fermions and electrons . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that spin degrees of freedom do not play an essential role in the systems considered . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we analyze localization and decay of single - particle excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that interactions generically tend to localize these excitations which is a result of the coulomb gap in the single - particle density of states . </S>"
