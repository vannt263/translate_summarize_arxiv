    "the classical kinetic theory of gases predicts exponents @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the degree of freedom of the molecule of the gas .",
    "here we will be concerned mostly with the particular choice @xmath14 .",
    "however several of our technical statements hold under the general assumption @xmath8 and the specific choice @xmath1 is relevant only to some portions of our proofs .",
    "it is well - known that , even starting from extremely regular initial data , the system develops singularities in finite time . in the mathematical literature",
    "a lot of effort has been devoted to understanding how solutions can be continued after the appearance of the first singularity , leading to a quite mature theory in one space dimension ( we refer the reader to the monographs @xcite,@xcite and @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we show that , in more than one space dimension , the most popular concept of an admissible solution fails to yield uniqueness even under very strong assumptions on the initial data .",
    "in particular we consider bounded weak solutions of , satisfying in the usual distributional sense ( we refer to definition [ d : weak ] for the precise formulation ) , and we call them admissible if they satisfy the following additional inequality in the sense of distibutions ( usually called _ entropy inequality _ , although for the specific system it is rather a weak form of energy balance ) : @xmath15 \\;\\leq\\ ; 0\\ ] ] where the internal energy @xmath16 is given through the law @xmath17 . indeed",
    ", admissible solutions are required to satisfy a slightly stronger condition , i.e. a form of which involves also the initial data , see definition [ d : admissible ] .",
    "for all solutions considered in this paper , @xmath4 will always be bounded away from @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath19 for some positive constant @xmath20 .",
    "we denote the space variable as @xmath21 and consider the special initial data @xmath22 where @xmath23 are constants .",
    "it is well - known that for some special choices of these constants there are solutions of which are _ rarefaction waves _ , i.e. self - similar solutions depending only on @xmath24 and @xmath25 which are locally lipschitz for positive @xmath24 and constant on lines emanating from the origin ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7.6 ) for the precise definition ) . reversing their order ( i.e. exchanging @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) the very same constants allow for a _ compression wave _ solution , i.e. a solution on @xmath28-\\infty , 0[$ ] which is locally lipschitz and converges , for @xmath29 , to the jump discontinuity of .",
    "when this is the case we will then say that the data are _ generated by a classical compression wave_.    we are now ready to state the main theorem of this paper    [ t : main ] assume @xmath1 .",
    "then there are data as in for which there are infinitely many bounded admissible solutions @xmath30 of on @xmath31 with @xmath32 . moreover , these data are generated by classical compression waves .",
    "it follows from the usual treatment of the @xmath2-dimensional riemann problem that for the data of theorem [ t : main ] uniqueness holds if the admissible solutions are also required to be self - similar , i.e. of the form @xmath33 and to have locally bounded variation ( see proposition [ p : riemann_classico ] ) .",
    "note that such solutions must be discontinuous , because the data of theorem [ t : main ] are generated by compression waves .",
    "we in fact conjecture that this is the case for _ any _ initial data allowing the nonuniqueness property of theorem [ t : main ] : however this fact does not seem to follow from the usual weak - strong uniqueness ( as for instance in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.3.1 ) ) because the lipschitz constant of the classical solution blows up as @xmath34 .",
    "related results in one space dimension are contained in the work of diperna @xcite and in the works of chen and frid @xcite , @xcite .    as an obvious corollary of theorem [ t : main ]",
    "we arrive at the following statement .",
    "[ c : compression ] there are lipschitz initial data @xmath35 for which there are infinitely many bounded admissible solutions @xmath30 of on @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "these solutions are all locally lipschitz on a finite interval on which they all coincide with the unique classical solution .",
    "we note in passing that , although the last statement of the corollary can be directly proved following the details of our construction , it is also a consequence of the admissibility condition , the lipschitz regularity of the compression wave ( before the singular time is reached ) and the well - known weak - strong uniqueness of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.3.1 ) .",
    "the proof of theorem [ t : main ] relies heavily on the works of the second author and lszl szkelyhidi , who in the paper @xcite introduced methods from the theory of differential inclusions to explain the existence of compactly supported nontrivial weak solutions of the _ incompressible _ euler equations ( discovered in the pioneering work of scheffer @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "it was already observed by the same pair of authors that these methods could be applied to the compressible euler equations and lead to the ill - posedness of bounded admissible solutions , see @xcite .",
    "however , the data of @xcite were extremely irregular and raised the question whether the ill - posedness was due to the irregularity of the data , rather than to the irregularity of the solution .",
    "a preliminary answer was provided in the work @xcite where the first author showed that data with very regular densities but irregular velocities still allow for nonuniqueness of admissible solutions .",
    "the present paper gives a complete answer , since we show that even for some smooth initial data nonuniqueness of bounded admissible solutions arises after the first blow - up time .",
    "it remains however an open question how irregular such solutions have to be in order to display the pathological behaviour of theorem [ t : main ] .",
    "one could speculate that , in analogy to what has been shown recently for the incompressible euler equations , even a `` piecewise hlder regularity '' might not be enough ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and in particular @xcite .",
    "this paper draws also heavily from the work @xcite where szkelyhidi coupled the methods introduced in @xcite-@xcite with a clever construction to produce rather surprising irregular solutions of the incompressible euler equations with vortex - sheet initial data .",
    "this work of szkelyhidi was in turn motivated by the so - called muskat problem ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; we moreover refer to @xcite for a rather detailed survey ) .",
    "indeed the basic idea of looking for piecewise constant subsolutions as defined in section [ s : subsolution ] stems out of several conversations with szkelyhidi and have been inspired by a remark of shnirelman upon the proof of @xcite .      the research of camillo de lellis has been supported by the snf grant 129812 , whereas ondej kreml s research has been financed by the sciex project 11.152 .",
    "the authors are also very thankful to lszl szkelyhidi for several enlightning conversations .",
    "especially relevant for us is the appropriate notion of _ subsolution _ , which allows to use the methods of @xcite-@xcite to solve the equations _ and _ impose a certain specific initial data .",
    "we give here a brief description of the concept of subsolution relevant to us and refer to @xcite for the motivation behind it and its links to existing literature in physics and mathematics .",
    "consider first some data as in .",
    "we then partition the upper half space @xmath37 in regions contained between half - planes meeting all at the line @xmath38 , see definition [ d : fan ] and cf .",
    "figure [ fig : fan ] .",
    "we then define the density function @xmath39 to be constant in each region : this density function will indeed give the final @xmath4 for all the solutions we construct and it is therefore required to take the constant values @xmath40 in the outermost regions @xmath41 .",
    "fig11.pdf_t    we then solve the compressible euler equations in each region @xmath42 using the methods of @xcite . indeed observe that in each such region the density is constant and thus it suffices to to construct solutions of the _ incompressible _ euler equations with _",
    "constant pressure_. employing the methods of @xcite we can also impose that the modulus of the velocity is constant ( in each region ) : its square will be denoted by @xmath43 . in @xcite",
    "such solutions are constructed adding oscillations to an appropriate _ subsolution _ , which consists of a pair @xmath44 of smooth functions , the first taking values in @xmath45 and the second taking values in the space of symmetric , trace - free @xmath46 matrices .",
    "these functions satisfy the linear system of pdes @xmath47 and a suitable relaxation of the nonlinear constraints @xmath48 .    in our particular case",
    "we will choose our subsolutions to be _ constant _ on each region",
    "@xmath49 : the corresponding values will be denoted by @xmath50 and the corresponding globally defined ( piecewise constant ) functions @xmath51 will be called _ fan subsolutions _ of the compressible euler equations .",
    "we then wish to choose our subsolution so that , after solving in each region @xmath49 with the methods of @xcite , the resulting globally defined @xmath30 are admissible _ global _ solutions of .",
    "this leads to a suitable system of pdes for the piecewise constant functions @xmath51 which are summarized in the definitions [ d : subs ] and [ d : admiss ] . in section [ s : subsolution ] we then briefly recall the notions of the papers @xcite-@xcite and in section [ s : ci ] we describe how to suitably modify the arguments there to reduce the proof of theorem [ t : main ] to the existence of the `` fan subsolutions '' of definitions [ d : subs ] and [ d : admiss ] : the precise statement of this reduction is given in proposition [ p : subs ] .      in section [ s : algebra ] , by making some specific choices , the existence of such subsolution is reduced to finding an array of real numbers satisfying some algebraic identities and inequalities , see proposition [ p : algebra ] .",
    "indeed , since the functions @xmath51 assume constant values in each region of the fan decomposition , these conditions are nothing but suitable `` rankine - hugoniot type '' identitites and inequalities .",
    "although at this stage all computations can be carried in general , we restrict our attention to a fan decomposition which consists of only three regions",
    ". therefore , the resulting solutions provided by proposition [ p : subs ] ( and therefore also those of theorem [ t : main ] ) will take the constant values @xmath52 outside a `` wedge '' of the form @xmath53 : inside this wedge the solutions will instead behave in a very chaotic way .",
    "thus far , all the statements can be carried out for a general pressure law @xmath7 . in the case",
    "@xmath1 we also compute explicitely the well - known conditions that must be imposed on the velocities @xmath54 and @xmath40 so that the corresponding data are generated by a compression wave : this gives then an additional constraint .",
    "observe that for such data the `` classical solution '' will be a simple shock wave traveling at a certain speed , whereas the nonstandard solutions of theorem [ t : main ] `` open up '' the singularity and fill the corresponding region @xmath55 with many oscillations .    coming back to the algebraic constrains of proposition [ p : algebra ] , although there seems to be a certain abundance of solutions to this set of identities and inequalities , currently we do not have an efficient and general method for finding them .",
    "we propose two possible ways in the sections [ s : rho^2_1 ] and [ s : p_strana ] . that of section [ s : rho^2_1 ] is the most effective and produces the initial data of theorem [ t : main ] which are generated by a compression wave .",
    "that of section [ s : p_strana ] is an alternative strategy , where , instead of making a precise choice of the pressure law @xmath7 , we exploit it as an extra degree of freedom : as a result this method gives data as in theorem [ t : main ] but with a different pressure law , which is essentially a suitable smoothing of the step - function .",
    "we also do not know whether any of these data are generated by compression waves .",
    "finally in section [ s : riemann ] we show that the self - similar solutions to - are unique : this follows from classical considerations but since we have not been able to find a precise reference , we include the argument for completeness .",
