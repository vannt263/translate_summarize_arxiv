    "the application of the @xmath0-exact seiberg - witten map ( sw )  @xcite expansions  @xcite represents the current state - of - the - art in the field of the noncommutative ( nc ) gauge field theories @xcite and the associated particle - physics phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "a summation over all orders in the antisymmetric tensor @xmath1 at tree level is automatically achieved via this approach , leading to various interesting results .",
    "more importantly , the @xmath0-exact approach allows an access to nonlocal effects within the perturbative approach , most pronouncedly the quadratic uv / ir mixing  @xcite in the two - point functions at one loop  @xcite .",
    "a particular topic related to the sw map approach to the noncommutative gauge theories is the implementation of the gauge freedoms into the ( inter)action .",
    "this step is generally regarded as favorable as far as the control over various divergences in the perturbative quantum corrections is concerned .",
    "the original employment was via a @xmath0-iterative construction  @xcite . later on a @xmath0-exact substitute was suggested  @xcite and generalized to a second - order expansion afterwards  @xcite .",
    "while after the first order , it is natural to consider the second - order sw map ( either in the perturbative or in the @xmath0-exact approach ) in the perturbative quantum field theory , in the past the second order has been much less investigated   @xcite .",
    "the reason was obviously technical : the second - order sw map solution is inherently much more complicated than the first - order one and requires consequently more effort to obtain explicitly the gauge invariant action and to implement the gauge freedom .",
    "recently the model building works based on the @xmath2 order sw map of non - abelian gauge fields have received more attention   @xcite when the order-@xmath0 correction vanishes , yet studies on quantum corrections are still absent .",
    "going from the @xmath0-expansion to @xmath0 exact , the second - order sw map adds its unique additional difficulties .",
    "two expansion solutions sharing the identical first order do exist  @xcite .",
    "each solution involves its own type of 3-products ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 as in  @xcite ) , and while the leading order of these two solutions with respect to @xmath0 can be shown to be connected by gauge transformation , the full solutions are not  @xcite .",
    "the gauge freedom structure at second order in the @xmath0-exact approach is considerably more complicated than the first order , and also more complicated than its @xmath2-order counterpart . besides the existence of two solutions , the field strength expansion from each solution contains distinct gauge freedom structures  @xcite . analyzing",
    "the @xmath2 order indicates that more gauge freedom structures will show up after performing the integration - by - part in the action .",
    "performing the same procedure @xmath0-exactly meets the difficulty from the noncommutativity and/or nonassociativity of the generalized star products .",
    "this issue is much less pressing at the @xmath5 order since the @xmath6 product satisfies the so - called 3-cyclicity  @xcite @xmath7 however , there is no 4-cyclicity in general , (@xmath6 and @xmath4 products have some cyclicity left , while @xmath3 has practically no cyclicity left . ) in this paper we will show that the proper substitute to integration - by - part in the @xmath0-exact computation on moyal space is to fourier - transforming the whole computation to the momentum space and achieve the explicit gauge - invariant action simultaneously with the verification of the ward identity of the vertex .    following the preliminary work in  @xcite , we present in this paper , for the first time , the full sw - map based / inspired nonlocally deformed four - photon couplings on moyal space , with all reasonable gauge freedom parameters included , and their quantum correction induced by such coupling via the one - loop four - photon - tadpole diagram .",
    "we use two distinct second - order @xmath0-exact sw map expansions for the gauge field strength ( which we call model ( i ) and ( ii ) , as dubbed recently in  @xcite ) with all the freedom / ambiguity / deformation parameters included . from these field strengths",
    "we then derive the corresponding actions and show that they can be expressed explicitly in terms of the commutative @xmath8 field strength @xmath9 by working out the integration - by - part procedure required .",
    "our final form for both sw map based actions further indicates that the @xmath0-exact freedom parameters we suggested before  @xcite would not deplete all the @xmath0-iterative possibilities in  @xcite .",
    "the two additional gauge freedom / ambiguity / deformation parameters are thus introduced by hand in turn .",
    "we then determine the four - photon coupling vertices with all possible gauge freedom / ambiguity / deformation parameters included from models i and ii and write down the one - loop four - photon - tadpole integrals for these models .",
    "we find that various momentum factors in the second - order sw map expansion reduce either to unity or to the common nonlocal factor @xmath10 in the tadpole , the same as found in the three - photon - bubble diagram studied previously  @xcite .",
    "it is long known that the massless tadpole integrals all vanish at the integration dimensions @xmath11 under dimensional regularization  @xcite .",
    "however this result is modified by the nonlocal factors  @xcite . in order to precisely verify this effect",
    "we evaluate the tadpole integral using two different methods : the first method simply introduces a pair of identical numerators and denominators to turn the tadpole into the bubble integral then evaluate the tadpole using the protocol established for the bubble diagram , as we did in  @xcite .",
    "the second method generalizes the @xmath12-nested zero regulator  @xcite for the commutative tadpole diagram .",
    "we compute the four - photon - tadpole contributions to the photon two - point function as a function of unspecified number of the integration dimensions @xmath13 .",
    "then we specify gauge field theory dimension d by taking the limits @xmath14 .",
    "next we especially discuss the @xmath15 case . in the end",
    ", we find that both approaches reveal the same _ purely _ quadratic ir divergent result in the @xmath16 limit , verifying the soundness of our computation .",
    "the uv / ir mixing phenomenon , reflecting the inherent nonlocality of the full theory and arising from the high - momentum region of integration in the feynman integrals , shows up as a ir divergence when the spatial extension of the nc string of size @xmath17 gets reduced to a point .",
    "a related anomaly is a nonanalytical behavior in the nc parameter @xmath0 , when the limit @xmath18 is undertaken . in the nc gauge theory , however , a quadratic ir divergence coexists with the logarithmic divergence which matches the uv behavior .",
    "our study indicates that the quadratic ir divergence is clearly connected with tadpole integrals . therefore the gauge invariant four photon interaction we found may serve as counterterms to cancel quadratic ir divergence . for this purpose",
    "the tadpole induced quadratic ir divergence is summed together with the corresponding contribution from the photon bubble diagram  @xcite .",
    "we find that while it is indeed possible to do so in both models i and ii , the procedure requires fixing the first - order gauge freedom parameter  @xcite @xmath19 .",
    "subsequently a third possible action ( iii ) , inspired by the structures of the first two , is introduced .",
    "it involves a sw - map inspired gauge invariance deformation in a more general way .    in this action",
    "each manifestly gauge invariant four - photon coupling term starting at @xmath2 order is assigned an independent freedom parameter , which is shown to be sufficient to cancel any quadratic ir divergences from the bubble diagram for the two typical @xmath0 values .",
    "( the uv divergences still require separated fine - tuning . )",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in the first two sections we describe two @xmath0-exact seiberg - witten map models up to the @xmath20 order and construct the four - photon self - interaction , as a model definition .",
    "section iii is devoted to the computation , presentation , and discussion of the @xmath0-exact tadpole in @xmath13 and four dimensions , while in the sec .",
    "iv we analyze a sum of the bubble and the tadpole diagram to show elimination of ir divergences for arbitrary @xmath0-matrix . in the sec .",
    "v we introduce a generalized model of the deformed four - photon interaction and show the elimination of all divergences from the bubble plus the tadpole diagram for the special choice of the @xmath0-matrix and freedom parameters .",
    "sections vi and vii present the discussion and conclusion , respectively . in this article",
    "the capital letters denote noncommutative objects , while the small letters denote the commutative ones .",
    "as usual we consider the formal @xmath21 nc gauge theory action @xmath22 where the formal nc gauge field strength @xmath23 is regarded as a composite operator built - up using the commutative gauge field operator @xmath24 and the nc parameter @xmath1 via the sw map procedure .",
    "the set of parameters @xmath25 represents in principle the sw map / gauge - invariance freedoms .",
    "the commutative coupling constant @xmath26 is attached to the commutative gauge field operator @xmath24 due to the charge quantization issue  @xcite . as a bonus feature it also serves as the ordering parameter for",

    "<S> a novel nonlocal four - photon interaction on the deformed spacetime is derived and studied in the three selected models ( i , ii , iii ) . the first two models ( i , ii ) </S>",
    "<S> are obtained via two distinct second - order @xmath0-exact seiberg - witten maps of the noncommutative u(1 ) gauge field strength on moyal space . </S>",
    "<S> the third one ( iii ) , inspired by the manifestly gauge invariant structures emerging in the first two , due to the model generality has been constructed with a different set of freedom parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the physical relevancy of all models is analyzed by evaluating the four - photon - tadpole diagram , which , when combined with the bubble graph , enables us to fully consider all contributions to the one - loop photon polarization tensor . </S>",
    "<S> for an arbitrary noncommutative matrix @xmath1 , the full quadratic ir divergence cancellation in the one - loop photon two - point function is obtained with particular combinations of seiberg - witten map / gauge - symmetry freedom parameters in models i and ii . finally , our model iii enables complete elimination of all pathological terms in the photon polarization tensor at one - loop order if a special value for the @xmath0 matrix is chosen . </S>"
