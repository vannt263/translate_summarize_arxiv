    "it is well established that the description of electronic states in narrow band materials requires improvements over the single particle approximation with a proper inclusion of on - site coulomb interaction between localized electrons @xcite . in these systems",
    "the itinerant character of valence electrons which is clearly shown by the energy k - dispersion observed in photoemission spectroscopy coexists with strong local electronic correlation responsible of other observed features such as satellite structures and band - narrowing effects .",
    "the interplay of localization and itineracy has also been indicated as a possible explanation of the observed spin polarization of core level spectra through exchange coupling betweeen localized ( core ) and itinerant ( valence ) states @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a theoretical description of the valence and core electron states of nickel according to a method recently developed which has been designed to treat highly correlated and highly hybridized systems  @xcite including both the itinerant character of band electrons and the strong localized electron - electron repulsion .",
    "this method allows to include narrow - band correlation effects into a first - principle band calculation ; the single - particle band states are determined according to the density functional theory in the local density approximation ( lda ) and the correlation effects are described as a 3-body scattering ( 3bs ) solution of a multi - orbital hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "this approach has been previously applied to the description of valence and conduction states of both model systems @xcite and realistic materials @xcite .",
    "we present here an extension of the method in order to treat both valence and core state on the same footing ; this extension is possible in this scheme since it relies on a multi - orbital hubbard hamiltonian where core and valence states can coexist and on the 3bs method which can be applied for any value of effective on - site electron - electron repulsion .",
    "as far as the valence states are concerned various methods have been proposed to augment conventional band theory for the description of the electronic states of nickel ; some of them are based on perturbative expansion either in the e - e interaction ( gw approach @xcite , second- order solution of the hubbard hamiltonian @xcite ) or in the fluctuations of the electron occupation around lda mean - field solution @xcite ; others apply a t - matrix scheme where the effect of electron correlation on one electron removal energies from a partially filled band is described as a hole - hole interaction @xcite .",
    "this method is strictly valid only in the limit of an almost filled band ( dilute limit ) and its application to the case of nickel has been questioned @xcite . in order to implement this approach",
    "it is necessary to include also electron - electron scattering channels and to solve a 3-body scattering problem involving two holes and one electron .",
    "this is the spirit of the 3bs theory we apply here and which originally has been formulated by igarashi @xcite .",
    "this approach has recently been applied to the description of valence states of nickel @xcite choosing , however , an approximate form of self - energy in terms of the antisymmetrized vertex function ; in this way the self - energy turns out to be real , giving rise to peaks in the spectral density of unphysical zero width . here",
    "we will instead adopt a version of the theory which avoids this shortcoming and which is based on the explicit solution of the 3-body scattering equations @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of core level spectroscopies has up to now largely been based on atomic models which interpret the structures observed in the one electron removal spectra in terms of multiplet states formed by coupling the core hole to the unfilled valence shell @xcite .",
    "this scheme has in particular been applied to the photoemission spectra from the core states of transition metals @xcite attributing the observed characteristic line splitting to intra - atomic exchange interaction between core and valence electrons of an isolated atom .",
    "such an approach has been seriously questioned since the observed splittings and the energy scale of the interaction are of the same order of magnitude as the valence band width @xcite ; a picture which takes into account the itinerant character of valence electrons seems therefore necessary . with the advent of spin",
    "polarized spectroscopies such as spin resolved x - ray photoemission @xcite and magnetic circular dichroism @xcite the spin dependence of both the main line and the satellites of ni core level spectra has been widely investigated @xcite .",
    "we will show that the 3bs solution of a multi - band hubbard hamiltonian , where full details of the valence band structure are included , can account for these spectroscopical features and interpret them in terms of on - site interaction between localized ( core ) and itinerant ( valence ) states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we present in section [ sec - hh ] the multi - orbital hubbard hamiltonian and its relationship to the band hamiltonian we want to implement ; section [ sec - selfe ] describes the main characteristics of the method which we use to get an approximate solution of the hubbard hamiltonian in terms of self - energy corrections to band eigenstates and of spectral densities ; section [ sec - val ] and [ sec - core ] specialize to the case of valence and core states respectively ; the results and the comparison with experiments are presented in section [ sec - res ] .",
    "band structure eigenvalues are in many cases good zero - order approximations to the excitation spectrum of a solid and it seems reasonable to use them as a starting point for the inclusion of correlation effects according to the hubbard model ; the implicit assumption is that among all the many body terms responsible of electron correlation , the coulomb repulsion between electrons on the same site is the one which needs to be treated explicitly . to do this",

    "when applied to valence states of ferromagnetic nickel the method allows to get a quasiparticle band structure which compares much more favourably with the experimental observation than conventional mean - field lda band structure eigenvalues , reproducing the observed band width , the energy dispersion , the satellite structure and the exchange splitting . since the method does not rely on a perturbation expansion it has a wide range of application , including any correlation regime .",
    "the extension to core levels is quite natural and allows to take fully into account the itinerant character of valence electrons .",
    "we get then a physical picture of the _ 3p _ core level spectrum where the spin splitting of the main line is associated to the valence band spin polarization and to the core - valence exchange interaction ; the two satellites are interpreted as arising from shake - up processes occurring after the removal of a core electron , involving the creation of a _ d _ band e - h pair . even though our present choice of empirically determining the parameters of the hubbard hamiltonian ensures that we obtain an overall good agreement with experiments we believe that the possibility of reproducing both the satellite structures , the main line and their spin dependence with just four parameters can be seen as a non trivial result .",
    "the widely used atomic models - which use empirical parameters as well - require also an ad - hoc evaluation of the so called extra - atomic effects which allow to take into account the role of electrons on neighbouring atoms @xcite ; such effects are on the contrary included here from the beginning since the full details of the valence band structure of the solid system are considered . in this sense",
    "the present approach can be considered an appropriate tool to describe the response of an itinerant electron system to the creation of a core hole .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec - val ] the application of the 3bs method to the valence band states of nickel requires the explicit definition of matrix elements of the hamiltonian [ hhv ] containing a non - interacting part that we call here @xmath166 and the on - site interaction among opposite spin electrons that we denote by @xmath167 .",
    "the matrix elements involve states @xmath70 and @xmath126 defined in [ states ] and pictorially depicted in fig .",
    "1 . we have @xmath168    @xmath169    as discussed in section [ sec - core ] the description of core states requires the inclusion of the interaction involving the exchange integral that we call here @xmath170 and the extension of the complete set to the three - particle configurations @xmath122 of fig .",
    "it is easy to show that in this case the diagonal matrix elements are similar to the previous ones and that the non- zero off - diagonal ones are @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 .",
    "we illustrate the procedure which leads to eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) - ( [ 9 ] ) for the removal of one spin up electron .",
    "the relationship ( [ ftt ] ) between the diagonal hole - propagator and the 3-body resolvent is obtained by inserting the completness relation @xmath174 into the identity @xmath175 that is @xmath176 g_{ss}(z ) - \\sum_t v_{s t } g_{t s}(z ) = 1 \\label{gts}\\ ] ] since @xmath177 can be obtained by eq .",
    "( [ dyson ] ) as @xmath178 one gets @xmath176g_{ss}(z ) - \\sum_{t t ' } v_{st } v_{t 's } f_{tt ' } g_{ss } + \\sum_{t t ' } \\sum_{s \\neq s ' } v_{st } v_{t 's ' } f_{tt ' } g_{ss ' } = 1 \\label{a3}\\ ] ] by substituting the explicit definition of the matrix elements of @xmath60 it appears that the two summations in ( [ a3 ] ) involve terms of the kind @xmath179 with @xmath180 , @xmath181 in the first and second sum respectively . for this reason it seams reasonable to neglect in ( [ a3 ] ) the last summation with respect to the first one getting in this way eq .",
    "( [ ftt ] ) as a result .    according to eq .",
    "( [ sigmab ] ) the self - energy is given by the sum @xmath182 where we have used the definition [ states ] for @xmath126 and @xmath183 .",
    "let us define now the orbital dependent free propagator describing h - h scatterings @xmath184 where the summation is over filled states of band indeces @xmath185 and @xmath186 . by using the definition ( [ tmat ] )",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath187 it is also useful to define the orbital - dependent t - matrix for h - h scatterings @xmath188 similar definitions and relations hold for e - h scatterings .",
