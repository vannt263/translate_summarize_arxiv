    "direct imaging surveys of extrasolar planets are conducted by using large telescopes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "many planet candidates , whose magnitudes reach around 22  mag in the @xmath0 band ( 1.6  ) and @xmath4 band ( 2.2  ) , were detected .",
    "however , only about 10 extrasolar planets have been confirmed . in other words ,",
    "most of the detected candidates are stars that are not companions , located in the same line of sight , despite the primary goal of detecting extrasolar planets .",
    "it is therefore important to estimate the number of unbound stars in a given field of view ( fov ) .",
    "the mean number of such stars can be estimated using a stellar distribution model of the galaxy .",
    "the standard stellar distribution model was proposed based on optical observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite modified parameters of this model , such as the scale height and length , using the sdss ( sloan digital sky survey ) up to 22  @xmath5  mag in the @xmath6 band ( 6231   ) , in order to match with deeper optical star counts .",
    "the same distribution profiles of the aforementioned model are applicable to the infrared star counts ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently , some studies were conducted to optimize parameters of this model to match with the space telescope catalogues up to around 15  mag in the near - infrared ( nir ) band ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite conducted deep imaging observations directed toward the north galactic pole in the @xmath7 band using subaru telescope , and their findings showed that observations were consistent with the model s predictions , including m - dwarfs and brown dwarfs ( l- and t - type stars ) .",
    "however , they could not quantitatively discuss the number densities of these stars due to the small sample size .",
    "the stellar distribution model of the galaxy was evaluated only up to 15  mag in the nir band , although detected stars are generally fainter for extrasolar planet surveys .",
    "there is some doubt as to whether this model can be used to estimate the number of such faint stars .",
    "it is highly probable that these stars are distant late - type dwarfs . actually , it is difficult to establish the number densities of these dwarfs outside the solar vicinity .",
    "there are several studies focused only on the m - dwarf distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is however too early for a clear consensus on how m - dwarfs are distributed to have emerged .",
    "this study seeks to constrain the number densities of distant m - dwarfs using the star counts in deep nir imaging .",
    "furthermore , we apply the results to the extrasolar planet survey data in order to estimate the number of field stars ( i.e. non - companions ) in a survey field .    in section  [ sec :",

    "then , this model is applied to the extrasolar planet survey data in section  [ sec : application ] .",
    "we employed the standard stellar distribution model described as follows .",

    "the numbers were allocated to the sub - bins in the ratio of 1:2 in favor of fainter stars in cases the exact ratio was unknown .",

    "we therefore performed the aperture correction for the @xmath0-band magnitudes using the same difference between the total and aperture magnitudes as in the @xmath40 band .",
    "the distinction between stars and galaxies was done based on the spectroscopic work by @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish between l- and t - type brown dwarfs and galaxies by spectroscopy , but the result should remain largely unaffected because the total number of such stars detected in this survey was expected to be small .",
    "we only used stars brighter than 21.5  mag because colors and spectroscopic observations were not sufficient for fainter targets .",
    "we thus assumed all objects brighter than 20.5  mag to be stars , although some contamination ( e.g. external galaxies ) is to be expected in the 20.5 to 21.5  mag bin .",

    "the total sky coverage was @xmath49 .",
    "stars have already been distinguished from galaxies by @xcite .",

    "we extracted stars from the point source catalogue created by @xcite based on the value of _",

    "class_star _ was larger than 0.8 were regarded as stars .",
    "we only used the photometric results of the f160w filter data ( _ flux_auto _ ) .",
    "we converted the flux in the @xmath5 magnitude system to the vega magnitude system ( adopting a correction value of 1.5  mag only for the ers region ) .",
    "the final detection limit was approximately 24.5  mag in the ers region , and 23.5  mag in the candels region .",
    "therefore , we assumed that all objects in the ers region and all , except those in the 22.523.5  mag bin within the candels region are stars , and expected that the 22.523.5 mag bin in the candels region includes some external galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig-5 - 6](a ) shows the comparison between the detected number and the predicted number per square degree .",
    "while the error bars of the predicted number represent @xmath46 poisson scatter , the uncertainties in the detected number of the ers region are taken from @xcite .",
    "the results of goods - north ( mods region ) and goods - south ( ers and candels regions ) are shown in the left and right side of figure  [ fig-5 - 6 ] , respectively . in figure  [ fig-5 - 6](a ) , the detected numbers shown as bar graphs were compared with predicted numbers shown as a solid line ( case  1 : standard case ) and dotted line ( case  2 : minimum case ) .",

    "we therefore only discuss the results with respect to the predictions of case  1 , while the same conclusion holds for case  2 .",
    "it was not necessary to correct for interstellar extinction because observations were conducted in the @xmath0 band and the galactic pole data was used .",
    "we mention the results of comparison of each field in subsection  [ subsec : results_goods - n ] and [ subsec : results_goods - s ] , then consider how to optimize the stelar distribution model to match with these deep nir imaging in subsection  [ subsec : discussion ] .",
    "the detected number was smaller than the predicted number in all bins in the left panel of figure  [ fig-5 - 6](a ) .",
    "we found from figure  [ fig-5 - 6](b ) that almost all predicted stars are members of the thick disk or the halo , and that these stars are mainly m - dwarfs .",
    "this shows that the number of m - dwarfs in the thick disk and halo component is small compared to the model predictions .",
    "this result indicates that both the thick disk and halo have fewer m - dwarfs compared to the population in the solar vicinity .",
    "we also checked the @xmath40-band star count using the lsd shown in figure  [ fig-3 ] and the relationship shown in figure  [ fig-4 ] .",
    "the left side of figure  [ fig_new ] shows the comparison between the detection and prediction .",
    "the same result holds if mods data from the @xmath40 band is used .",
    "stars other than m - dwarfs ( e.g. l- and t - type stars ) were rarely detected in the range of 16.5 to 21.5  mag ( see figure  [ fig-5 - 6](b ) ) .",
    "moreover , contamination from external galaxies is negligible because @xcite distinguished stars from galaxies based on their spectra .",
    "while the possibility of contamination by faint galaxies can not be completely ruled out at magnitudes between 20.5 and 21.5  mag , our conclusion is conservative because the difference between the detected and predicted number would be even larger than that in case of including external galaxies by mistake , further enhancing the problem of missing faint stars in the thick disk and halo .",
    "the detected number was consistent with the predicted number for magnitudes brighter than 17.5  mag , but much smaller for fainter magnitudes in both ers and candels regions from figure  [ fig-5 - 6](a ) .",
    "almost all predicted stars belong to the thick disk or halo , and most of these stars are m - dwarfs according to the model ( see figure  [ fig-5 - 6](b ) ) .",
    "this finding implies that fewer m - dwarfs exist in the thick disk and the halo compared to the prediction using the standard lsd .",
    "this tendency is corroborated by observations from the goods - south field using the f125w filter ( corresponding to the @xmath7 band ) , as can be seen in the right panel of figure  [ fig_new ] .",
    "the finding is thus independent of the observational band .",
    "the catalogue by @xcite distinguished between stars and galaxies reliably .",
    "all detected objects shown in the ers region of figure  [ fig-5 - 6](a ) are therefore regarded as stars . in the candels region ,",
    "stars and galaxies were identified based on the @xmath51 values .",
    "it is generally difficult to avoid contamination by galaxies completely for faint objects when this method is employed .",
    "however , our conclusion as mentioned above does not change because the discrepancy between the detected and predicted stellar counts would only be enhanced , even in case of a small fraction of extragalactic contaminations .",
    "there was a discrepancy between the ers and candels star counts .",
    "focusing on the 22.523.5 mag bin , the star count of candels was larger than that of ers .",
    "we believe this to be due to the inclusion of some galaxies in the candels star counts .",
    "all other bins were consistent within the ers uncertainties .",
    "the detected number of galactic stars is significantly smaller than the number predicted by the standard stellar distribution model of the galaxy .",
    "most of the stars belong to the thick disk or halo components and more than 80% of these stars are m - dwarfs according to the model .",
    "the detected stellar count and the predicted numbers from a standard parameterization of the galaxy begin to differ significantly at @xmath52  mag , a depth previously unachieved by surveys traditionally used for constraining the galactic parameters ( sdss , 2mass ) .",
    "detected m - dwarfs fainter than 20.5  mag need to be more distant than @xmath53  kpc from the sun .",
    "our results imply that there are significantly fewer m - dwarfs at 1  kpc or more from the galactic plane than previously thought .",
    "the number density of m - dwarfs in the thick disk or the scale height of the thick disk has to be decreased to match the model s results with the detected number in both goods fields .",
    "in addition to this , the number density of m - dwarfs in the halo has to be decreased .",
    "alternatively , employing significantly smaller fractions of the halo ( @xmath19 ) and thick disk ( @xmath18 ) can also explain the scarcity of m - dwarfs observed . as the deep nir data we used",
    "is predicted to contain mostly distant m - dwarfs ( see figure  [ fig-5 - 6 ] b ) , both choices have similar effects in our model .",
    "@xcite showed , for stars up to 3  kpc , that the stellar metallicity decreases with increasing distance from the galactic mid - plane , which is explained by the scenario of halo and thick disk originating from dwarf galaxies having merged with the galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is theoretically predicted that the cooling rate is small in metal - poor clouds and that high - mass stars tend to form more than low - mass stars in this condition .",
    "stars belonging to the halo may form from metal - poor clouds . with respect to our results , this indicates that lower metallicity in the halo and thick disk component might be correlated with a m - dwarf deficit .",
    "we used three methods to improve upon the stellar distribution model s parameters .",
    "firstly , we changed the number densities of m - dwarfs ( m0m9 ) in the halo and thick disk , in order to match them with the detected number . only the ers region of the goods - south data was used because of its small uncertainty and large sample size . the best - fit case ( shown in figure  [ fig-3 ] as dotted lines )",
    "was achieved with number densities of @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the halo and the thick disk , respectively , relative to the standard parameters ( case  1 ) .",
    "we re - calculated the predicted numbers using the best - fit case , and show the comparison between the new predictions and the detected numbers in figure  [ fig-7 ] .",
    "it is evident that the best - fit case in figure  [ fig-7 ] improves on the standard parameters shown in figure  [ fig-5 - 6](a ) . in figure",
    "[ fig-7 ] , a small disagreement can be seen in some bins , but this discrepancy falls within the @xmath56 uncertainty , considering poisson noise of predictions and observational uncertainties . as mentioned in subsection  [ subsec : lsd ] , our lsds for stars later than l5 are slightly larger than those of @xcite , but the overall effect on our results is small considering the expected low number of these stars .",
    "results of @xcite also tentatively pointed into the direction of a deficit in the late - type halo subdwarf population .",
    "they showed that the late m - dwarf population could not be reproduced with their assumed halo to disk ratio ( 0.25% ) and axial ratio of the halo ( 0.7 ) .",
    "while we did not discuss the bulge , @xcite showed that the number density of m - dwarfs in the bulge is largely similar to the mass function from @xcite .",
    "secondly , we varied the halo and thick disk fractions ( @xmath19 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "when smaller fractions were employed , the number of predicted stars was likewise reduced .",
    "considering that most stars of 16.524.5 mag were m - dwarfs , employing overall smaller halo and thick disk fractions gave almost the same result as when reducing the number density of m - dwarfs in the halo and thick disk .",
    "however , even if we use the minimum fractions for the halo and thick disk within the uncertainty given by @xcite , the discrepancy between the predicted and detected number still emerges . we still need to reduce the number density of m - dwarfs to @xmath57 and @xmath58 of the original value for the thick disk and halo to be within",
    "the bound of uncertainty given by @xcite .    finally , we changed the scale height and length of the thick disk using the standard number density ( case  1 ) .",
    "the scale height of the thick disk was reported in many studies ( including @xcite and the references therein ) , based on star counts and stellar kinematics of the galaxy .",
    "the scale height varies between 500 and 1600  pc in these studies .",
    "@xcite showed that the scale height of the thick disk is @xmath59  pc using stellar kinematics of the galaxy .",
    "most of the previous studies based on star counts ( see references in @xcite ) concluded that the typical scale height is about @xmath60  pc .",
    "some studies , however , determined a smaller scale height .",
    "@xcite for example stated that the thick disk s scale height is @xmath61  pc based on 2mass star counts in the @xmath7 , @xmath0 , and @xmath40 bands .",
    "we found that the predicted number was consistent with the detected number when the disk parameters from @xcite were employed .",
    "in addition , several works focused only on the late - type dwarf distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) estimated the scale height of the thin disk based on star counts using a single disk model .",
    "they all concluded that the scale height of early m - dwarfs is larger than that of later than m5-dwarfs .",
    "these results indicate that the thick disk component of late - type dwarfs can not be clearly distinguished from the thin disk component .",
    "similarly , @xcite concluded that there is no thick disk in the galaxy , which is equivalent to employing a small scale height of the thick disk .",
    "moreover , there is some variation in the scale length of the disks in the published literature ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we changed the scale length of the thick disk ranging from 2000 to 5000  pc , however , the predicted number was not considerably affected .    in summary",
    ", it can be said that the predicted star count at @xmath62  mag was not consistent with standard parameters from models construed from data with relatively low limiting magnitudes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they tend to over predict the number of distant faint stars .",
    "the model matches the observations when we reduce the m - dwarf number density for the halo and thick disk component by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "alternatively , the overall thick disk fraction ( @xmath18 ) and halo fraction ( @xmath19 ) can be lowered .",
    "reducing the thick disk s scale height to @xmath3  pc also made the model agree better with the data , but still required changing the m - dwarf density ( or overall fraction @xmath19 ) of the halo .",
    "the question whether the fraction of m - dwarfs in the thick disk is smaller to begin with , or whether its scale height is lower for late - types can ultimately not be resolved from the presented data .",
    "in section  [ sec : results ] , the model parameters were fit to the deep nir survey result .",

    "stars observed in the @xmath0 band . _ + for the seeds project , most observations were conducted in the @xmath0 band , and therefore , only @xmath0-band data were used .",
    "stars observed using the direct imaging + angular differential imaging ( di+adi : @xcite ) mode . _ + the di+adi mode is very effective for detecting point sources .",
    "we excluded more than 50 stars which were not observed in this mode .",
    "_ sufficient exposure time._[seeds4 ] + the detection limit improves with longer exposure times .",
    "we selected only deep observations whose exposure time was longer than 15 minutes .",
    "_ data is available for analysis . _",
    "+ despite satisfying requirements [ seeds1 ] through [ seeds4 ] , image data was not available for about 40 targets and could not be included in this study .",
    "point sources detected near primary stars were determined to be companions ( binaries or planets ) by measuring their proper motions . while it would be preferable to use only confirmed unbound stars , we also included stars whose binary status could not be confirmed to extend the sky coverage and increase the sample size .",
    "this is justified by the large separation and faintness of many point sources lacking proper motion confirmation , rendering the a - priori probability of these objects being part of the primary system very small .",
    "the analysis method is shown in appendix  [ app : analysis ] .",
    "we then calculated the number of stars , that are not companions , using the best - fit number density .",
    "figure  [ fig-9 ] shows the comparison between the observed number and the predicted number in the whole seeds field , with a given uncertainty of @xmath46 poisson scatter . for reference",
    ", we also showed the predicted number using the standard case ( case  1 ) in figure  [ fig-9 ] .",
    ", width=453 ]      focusing on the result of the best - fit model , the detected number is consistent with the predicted number at 18.519.5  mag and fainter than 20.5  mag when we include the stars awaiting follow up observations ( striped bins in figure  [ fig-9 ] ) , but is larger in the other bins . the number density in the thin and thick disk",
    "may be increased to match with the detected number by being considered that there is little possibility that stars shown as stripe bins are companions , and that there is a few halo stars in the seeds field . increasing the number density in the thin disk leads to a stronger deviation from the result of the goods field .",
    "the cause of this discrepancy could be explained by considering that the seeds field is about ten time smaller than each goods field .",
    "the model result is still within @xmath56 uncertainty of the data .",
    "we then discuss the difference between the best - fit case and the standard case ( case  1 ) . the predicted number in the standard case is larger for all bins , and",
    "might be more consistent with the detected number for magnitudes brighter than 20.5  mag compared to the best - fit case .",
    "however , employing the best - fit case is well - suited to reproducing the number of fainter stars ( @xmath62  mag ) , because we produced the best - fit case to match with the number of detected faint stars in the goods fields .",
    "we thus propose employing the model using the best - fit number density , which includes smaller m - dwarf density in the halo and thick disk , when estimating the number of faint contaminating field stars in extrasolar planet surveys .",
    "we further discuss the discrepancy between the detected and the predicted number , especially with respect to stars that have unconfirmed companion status .",
    "there is a high probability that most of these stars are unbound stars .",
    "@xcite showed that the fraction of stars with giant planets at larger separation is less than 17.9% , and an equal or lower fraction was estimated in previous studies ( including the references in @xcite ) .",
    "while we can not rule out contamination by external galaxies completely due to lack of multi - color observations in the seeds project , galaxies can still be excluded based on the fwhm of their psf ( point spread function ) in most cases .",
    "the true number of detected stars would be smaller than the number shown in figure  [ fig-9 ] , if any galaxies still remain in the sample of detected stars .",
    "other effects , such as interstellar extinction , stars of the bulge component , and contamination by giants , can be neglected due to the selection and the magnitude range of the sample ( see subsection  [ subsec : seeds - data ] and figure  [ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "some stars in the seeds field belong to a cluster ( e.g. the pleiades open cluster ) .",
    "therefore there is a possibility that low - mass stars in the cluster were included .",
    "we estimated the number of low - mass stars from the mass function of the pleiades ( e.g. @xcite ) , but the number is too small to explain the disagreement between the detected and predicted numbers .",
    "consequently , it is considered that the discrepancy is attributed to the small sample size because it can not be fully explained by the aforementioned causes .",
    "we inspected predictions from a stellar distribution model from deep nir imaging , in order to estimate the number of unbound stars in extrasolar planets surveys using direct imaging .",
    "we used data from regions in the goods - north ( mods region ) and goods - south fields ( ers and candels regions ) .",
    "the detected number of stars was compared with the predicted number using the standard stellar distribution model in the galaxy .",
    "these numbers begin to differ significantly for @xmath62  mag .",
    "the number density of m - dwarfs in the thick disk or the scale height of the thick disk have to be decreased to match with the detected number .",
    "in addition , m - dwarfs have to be much less abundant in the halo component than they are expected from the number of m - dwarfs in the solar vicinity . alternatively , significantly reducing the overall halo and thick disk fraction yields similar results .",
    "the degeneracies in the model parameters ( e.g. , reducing scale height or component fraction ) can not ultimately be resolved with deep ir data alone .",
    "regardless of the exact realization chosen , it is clear that previous models based on data not as deep ( i.e. sdss or 2mass ) over predict the number of m - dwarfs in the regions distant from the galactic plane .",
    "this has implications for the prediction of the number of contaminating faint sources in direct imaging surveys for extrasolar planets .",
    "we consequently apply the model using our best - fit number density to the data of an actual extrasolar planet survey , the seeds data .",
    "the detected number of unbound stars shows good agreement with the prediction , but it is larger than expected in two of the magnitude bins ( 16.517.5 and 19.520.5 ) .",
    "it is thought that the small sample size might cause this discrepancy .",
    "we recommend employing the model using the best - fit number density , which has a smaller m - dwarf density in the halo and thick disk , when estimating the number of non - companion faint stars .",
    "we thank r. kooistra for spending the time to carefully proof - read our manuscript .",
    "we also thank the referee for all the insightful comments that helped improve this paper .",
    "the samples were analyzed in accordance with the following steps .    1 .   _",
    "adi analysis:_[analysis1 ] + the purpose of the adi analysis is to improve the contrast between the primary star and its surroundings by reducing the quasi - static speckle noise resulting from deep exposures .",
    "many methods for the analysis of adi data have been proposed . in this study , we only considered the region farther than @xmath70 away from the primary star to neglect the influence of the primary star s halo .",
    "standard adi analysis was employed as it provides the best signal - to - noise ratio in the region farther from the primary star @xcite .",
    "loci ( locally optimized combination of imaging ; @xcite ) analysis was not used because this method is often used to probe the closest vicinity of stars .",
    "the analysis was implemented in iraf ( image reduction and analysis facility ) .",
    "photometry of the primary star:_[analysis2 ] + the star s magnitudes and the detection limits were calculated using photometry of the primary star . in cases where images of the primary star were saturated ,",
    "we used the unsaturated data that was taken with the shorter exposure times and with a neutral density filter before and after the saturated images .",
    "aperture photometry was performed with the apphot package of iraf .",
    "the fwhm size of the stars was at most 8 pixels .",
    "both 20 and 40 pixels aperture radii were employed and for the sky area we adopted an annulus from 40 to 100 pixels centered on the star .",
    "the magnitude of the primary star was taken from the simbad catalogue .",
    "evaluation of self - subtraction:_[analysis3 ] + the flux of point sources is reduced by self - subtraction in adi analysis .",
    "self - subtraction generally increases when point sources are near the primary star .",
    "however , in this study , self - subtraction is approximately constant because only the area farther than @xmath70 from the primary star was used .",
    "we estimated the amount of self - subtraction using the following method : artificial stars ( 6 - 10 stars per image ) were randomly embedded in the images , except for the edge and near the primary star .",
    "we then analyzed the data following the procedure described in [ analysis1 ] and [ analysis2 ] and repeated this process until the number of embedded stars exceeded 100 ( ten or more iterations ) .",
    "we then averaged the self - subtractions over all data . in the area closest to the primary star ( @xmath71 )",
    "the amount of self - subtraction was always below 10% .",
    "_ calculation of the detection limit:_[analysis4 ] + we determined the @xmath72 detection limit by embedding stars of fixed magnitude using the sextractor tool @xcite to extract the point sources from the noise .",
    "ten stars were randomly embedded at the same time in the image after adi analysis ; the number of stars extracted within @xmath72 was then measured .",
    "this process was repeated 10 times and the overall fraction of detected point sources was then calculated .",
    "altering the magnitude of the artificial stars in steps of 0.1  mag , this process was repeated until the detected fraction dropped below 50% after correcting for self - subtraction .",
    "the derived detection limits were between 17.8 and 22.1  mag , with a median of 20.5  mag .",
    "_ investigating characteristics of detected stars:_[analysis5 ] + first , the magnitudes of detected stars were calculated .",
    "photometry was conducted as described in procedure  [ analysis2 ] .",
    "we corrected for self - subtraction according to procedure  [ analysis3 ] .",
    "we then confirmed whether detected stars were companions or unbound stars based on results from previous studies @xcite .",
    "the confirmation involved measuring the detected stars proper motions relative to the primary star .",
    "we used both unbound stars ( background and foreground stars ) as well as stars whose binary status could not be confirmed .",
    "finally , the mean number of unbound stars was calculated for every field using the optimized stellar distribution model .",
    "the detection limit for each field was corrected when the predicted number was calculated . because the signal - to - noise ratios were insufficient near the primary star and the edges of images , we removed these regions ( 20% of all fields ) .",
    "the predicted number in the seeds observations was the sum of the predicted number in each field .",
