    "one of the principle motivations for weak scale supersymmetry is that it provides a framework that stabilizes the hierarchy between the weak scale and the planck scale , or some other unification scale . in non - supersymmetric models ,",
    "the mass renormalization of fundamental scalars is quadratically divergent .",
    "this divergence must be cancelled , or the fundamental scalar will have a renormalized mass on the order of the cutoff . in the standard model , if the higgs boson remains a fundamental degree of freedom all the way up to some very heavy scale , we must fine tune a precise cancellation order by order in perturbation theory to maintain the lightness of the weak scale .",
    "supersymmetry solves this problem because the renormalization effects of superpartners eliminate the quadratic divergences .",
    "but supersymmetry is at best a broken symmetry .",
    "there are no superpartners degenerate in mass with the particles that have been observed so far .",
    "these superpartners can have gauge invariant mass terms if supersymmetry is softly broken , and these masses can be made arbitrarily large provided we increase the scale of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "there is a price for this . as the scale of supersymmetry breaking increases the weak scale",
    "can only remain light by virtue of an increasingly delicate cancellation .",
    "eventually a point is reached when the model no longer appears to provide a complete explanation of why a light weak scale is stable .",
    "attempts to pinpoint where and when our understanding of weak scale stability is lost , or becomes incomplete , must of necessity quantify some intuitive notion of naturalness .",
    "such a prescription for quantifying naturalness exists and is widely used in the literature . if we demand that supersymmetric extensions of the standard model should be `` complete '' in their explanations of this stability , we can place an upper limit on the scale of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "this can be translated into an upper limit on the masses of superpartners .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the prescription that is currently used to place upper bounds on superpartner masses .",
    "first , we wish to determine if these criteria accurately measure fine tuning .",
    "second , we want to make explicit the assumptions implicit in any attempt to quantify naturalness",
    ". upper limits on sparticle masses obtained from naturalness criteria influence expectations of when and where sparticles will be discovered if supersymmetry is responsible for the stability of the weak scale .    in section two",
    "we make a critical examination of fine tuning , and we analyze the prescription now used to quantify naturalness .",
    "we critique this traditional method by examining a well known hierarchy .",
    "we find that this prescription is not completely satisfactory .",
    "the trouble is that the traditional prescription does not distinguish between instances of global sensitivity and real instances of fine tuning .",
    "we argue that a reliable measure of fine tuning requires global information about the dependence of certain quantities on their arguments , and we show how the existing prescription can be augmented with this information to yield reliable measures of fine tuning .    in section three",
    "we systematically construct a family of prescriptions that coincide with the augmented prescriptions formulated in section two .",
    "our construction clarifies the proper normalization of naturalness measures and makes explicit the extent of theoretical prejudice present in any such measure .    in section four",
    "we apply our prescription to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "we briefly discuss the level of fine tuning the mssm requires in light of current experimental constraints , and we show how the current situation is much less fine tuned than it previously appeared .",
    "a more detailed and extensive application of our criteria to supersymmetric extensions of the standard model is in progress@xcite .",
    "when parameters conspire by cancelling or adding in an unusually precise fashion , we think of an atypical quantity that results as fine tuned . in such instances ,",
    "the quantity , for example @xmath0 , will exhibit a very strong dependence on its arguments@xcite .",
    "in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , the weak scale depends on the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters and other couplings through the renormalization group@xcite . in a seminal paper , barbieri and giudice",
    "used these features to place upper bounds on superpartner masses , and they popularized a prescription to quantify fine tuning that is now widely used .",
    "they looked for sensitivity in the @xmath1 mass to variations in the values of supersymmetry breaking parameters and other couplings .",
    "they measured the sensitivity on a general parameter @xmath2 by : @xmath3 note that rescaling the derivative by @xmath4 removes the dependence on the overall scale of @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "barbieri and giudice argued that , if supersymmetry is responsible for stabilizing the weak scale , then @xmath5 must be less than some upper limit @xmath6 , which they took to be @xmath7 .",
    "they used this criterion to place upper limits on supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "this program has been subsequently adopted by many researchers .",
    "the application of eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) in obtaining upper bounds on superpartner masses raises several questions .",
    "do we know the normalization of eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) well enough to say that natural solutions should exhibit @xmath8 s below @xmath7 or any other particular value",
    "? should we expect that a simple application of this formula will always give a reliable measure of fine tuning , and if not , can we construct alternative definitions that provide better measures of naturalness ?",
    "we can apply eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) to a famous hierarchy in order to shed some light on these questions .",
    "the lightness of the proton in comparison to either the planck scale or the grand unified scale is beautifully explained by the logarithmic running of the qcd coupling , @xmath9 . at one loop ,",
    "the scale dependence of the strong coupling constant can be expressed as @xmath10 for simplicity we take @xmath11 , where @xmath12 . a straight forward application of eq .  ( 2.1 ) to the proton mass yields @xmath13 the large value of @xmath14 occurs because the proton mass is a very sensitive function of @xmath15",
    ". the lightness of the proton is , of course , not the result of a fine tuning . the proton mass would have exhibited this strong sensitivity no matter what its value was , so it makes no sense to say that a value near @xmath16 gev is fine tuned .",
    "this example illustrates our central point .",
    "equation ( 2.1 ) is really a measure of sensitivity , and sensitivity does not automatically translate into fine tuning .",
    "for example , the overestimate of fine tuning would have been even worse had we used eq .  (",
    "2.1 ) to study the naturalness of the technicolour scale with respect to variations in the value of the technicolour gauge coupling at the extended technicolour scale",
    ". can be , _ in part _ , due to global sensitivity . as we will show in section four , @xmath17 over estimates the amount of fine tuning needed to maintain a light @xmath1 mass in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model . ]    a reliable measure of fine tuning should give a large value when a quantity is fine tuned and at the same time reduce to something close to unity when it encounters typical sensitivity .",
    "this suggests that we divide eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) by some measure of average sensitivity",
    ". the resulting ratio will still be large for solutions that are unusually sensitive , but in cases where solutions have a `` typical '' sensitivity the resulting ratio will be of order one .",
    "so a more reliable measure of fine tuning would be @xmath18 where @xmath19 is some average value of @xmath20 .",
    "for example , @xmath21 or @xmath22 if we apply this new criterion to the lightness of the proton , we find that @xmath23 is of order one .",
    "it is a simple matter to check that the ratio @xmath23 gives a large value in legitimate cases of fine tuning . if we apply eq .  (",
    "2.4 ) to the weak scale hierarchy in a non - supersymmetric model , we get a number of order @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the scale of the cutoff . as we show in the following section , a ratio in a form of eq .",
    "( 2.4 ) can be deduced from very general considerations .",
    "in this section we construct a family of quantitative measures of fine tuning that encompass eq .  ( 2.4 ) , the augmented prescription we motivated in the previous section .",
    "our purpose is twofold .",
    "first , we wish to systematically clarify what measures of fine tuning best quantify our intuitive notion of naturalness and how these measures should be normalized .",
    "second , we wish to make explicit the inherent , discretionary assumptions present in any standard that quantifies naturalness . any measure of fine tuning that quantifies naturalness can be translated into an assumption about how likely a given set of lagrangian parameters is . in the absence of a theoretical reason compelling us to choose a certain value",
    ", we can consider some sensible distribution of the parameter to study what are the natural predictions of the model .",
    "the `` theoretical license '' at one s discretion when making this choice necessarily introduces an element of arbitrariness to the construction .",
    "before we proceed to `` derive '' a quantitative measure of fine tuning some comments are in order . we are motivated to quantify naturalness for tangible theoretical reasons .",
    "a model that explains a phenomenon has more predictive power than a model that merely accommodates it .",
    "in addition , we understand why the proton can be naturally many orders of magnitude lighter than the planck scale but , the stability of a light scale in a theory of fundamental scalars is mysterious .",
    "we would like to understand how the weak scale remains light .",
    "of course , at the level of low energy effective theories , dismissing `` unnatural '' theories in the quest for a `` natural '' explanation of weak scale stability could be misguided .",
    "we certainly can not prove that an explanation of the light weak scale was not butchered by the process in which we constructed our effective theory .",
    "for example , one loop corrections to the cosmological constant from an effective theory with soft supersymmetry breaking generate contributions that are many orders of magnitude greater than the experimental limit . yet",
    "we often entertain the idea that the solution to this problem is not associated with our choice of a low energy lagrangian .",
    "while we can not elevate the prejudice of searching for natural theories above the level of an axiom , we can hope that its application will lead us to a more complete model that explains the stability of the weak scale .",
    "such models will have testable predictions .    in light of this",
    ", we proceed to deduce a measure of fine tuning from general principles .",
    "provided we parameterize our assumptions about the likely distribution for lagrangian parameters , we should be able to derive a quantitative measure of naturalness .",
    "assume the probability that a lagrangian parameter lies between @xmath2 and @xmath26 is @xmath27 consider a set of these lagrangian parameters @xmath28 specified at a renormalization scale that is the high energy boundary of our effective theory ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath29 ) .",
    "a measurable parameter @xmath30 ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath31 ) will depend on the @xmath28 through the renormalization group equations and possibly on a set of minimization conditions",
    ". we can recast eq .",
    "( 3.1 ) as a probability per unit @xmath30 . given a probability density @xmath32 , the probability density per unit @xmath30 is @xmath33 where @xmath34    in studies of naturalness",

    "a quantity @xmath30 is relatively unlikely to be in an interval proportional to @xmath37 if @xmath38 where @xmath39 .    if we are interested in studying the naturalness of a hierarchy like @xmath40 , @xmath41 , or @xmath42 , the interval that corresponds to the conventional sense of naturalness is @xmath43 . :",
    "the scalar mass can only remain light in comparison to the cutoff scale @xmath45 if we cancel the quadratic divergence against the bare term @xmath46 .",
    "note that the cancellation we need to place the scalar mass in a 1 gev window at @xmath47 gev must be made with the same precision as the cancellation we need to place the scalar mass in a 1 gev window at a 100 gev .",
    "a small value of the scalar mass is unnatural in the sense that a small change in @xmath48 leads to a large _ fractional _ change in @xmath49 so that it is relatively unlikely to be found in an interval @xmath50 around @xmath49 . ]    if we define our measure of naturalness as @xmath51 fine tuning corresponds to @xmath52 . the definition of @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( 3.5 ) necessarily implies that @xmath23 is linearly proportional to @xmath53 . for any realization of @xmath23",
    ", we define an average value of @xmath20 by @xmath54 this definition of @xmath19 corresponds to @xmath55 the similarity between this definition of @xmath19 and the heuristic average posed in section two is apparent .    in order to make practical use of the prescription contained in eqs .",
    "( 3.4)-(3.7 ) , we need to specify three things .",
    "first , our choice of @xmath32 reflects our theoretical prejudice about what constitutes a natural value of the lagrangian parameter @xmath2 .",
    "we will return to this point in section four .",
    "the two remaining choices are determined by the questions we wish to ask .",
    "our choice of @xmath56 is determined by the quantity whose naturalness we wish to study .",
    "the conventional notion of naturalness for hierarchy problems suggests @xmath43 .",
    "finally , our choice for the range of integration for @xmath2 is related to the broadness of the question we wish to ask .",
    "this point will be elaborated upon in section four .    before analyzing the naturalness of radiative symmetry breaking in the supersymmetric standard model we specialize eqs .",
    "( 3.6 ) and ( 3.7 ) to two examples .",
    "+ @xmath57 * example i * + let s return to the hierarchy between the proton mass and the planck scale discussed in section two .",
    "we will calculate @xmath23 for two different choices for @xmath32 . integrating over @xmath58 in the range @xmath59 we find @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 . in each case",
    "we see that , if the strong coupling constant at the planck scale is of order one , our measure indicates that a @xmath16 gev proton mass arises naturally .",
    "we have thus eliminated the problematic overestimate of fine tuning contained in the traditional prescription . in the following example",
    "we show that the new prescriptions still registers appropriately large values in real instances of fine tuning .",
    "@xmath57 * example ii * + consider the gauge hierarchy problem in a non - supersymmetric theory with fundamental scalars . in this case",
    ", the one - loop correction to the scalar mass will be of the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the ultraviolet cutoff of our effective theory , and @xmath66 is a bare term chosen to keep the scalar mass light . if we calculate the sensitivity of the higgs mass with respect to the coupling @xmath48 , we find @xmath67 integrating over @xmath48 in the range @xmath59 , we find @xmath68\\ ] ] for @xmath61 and @xmath69,\\ ] ] for @xmath63 . in each case @xmath19 is of order one , while @xmath70 is of order @xmath71 .",
    "this gives @xmath72 , which correctly reproduces the fine tuning needed to maintain light scalar masses . from these examples",
    ", we again see that the need to renormalize @xmath20 by @xmath19 is important .",
    "when @xmath30 depends very sensitively on @xmath2 , @xmath20 will be large even if there is no fine tuning .",
    "a largely exaggerated value for the traditional fine - tuning measure , which can occur in the absence of fine tuning , can be removed by rescaling by @xmath19 .",
    "there are two issues concerning naturalness that should be addressed for radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model . the first concerns the natural value of the electroweak scale if electroweak symmetry breaks .",
    "the second concerns the naturalness of the ewsb process itself . we will make no attempt to tackle the second problem in this paper , since this would require either knowledge of , or additional assumptions about , a more complete theory .",
    "as already noted , supersymmetry must be broken to reconcile the mssm with the lack of experimental evidence for superparticles . since no adequate model of spontaneously broken global susy exists , supersymmetry is customarily broken through the introduction of explicit soft terms that do not reintroduce quadratic divergences into the theory .",
    "low energy supergravity provides the motivation for the introduction of these soft breaking terms .",
    "the most general form of the soft susy breaking potential , including gaugino mass terms , is @xmath73 a generic feature of these sugra inspired models is universality in the soft terms .",
    "therefore , one customarily assumes the following boundary conditions for the masses and trilinears at the gauge coupling unification scale @xmath74 some universality is important in avoiding unwanted flavor changing neutral current effects .",
    "given the unification of gauge couplings , it is natural to take the gaugino masses equal as well @xmath75 there are therefore five soft breaking parameters , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 in the simplest version of the mssm .",
    "for simplicity and definiteness , we will concentrate on this restricted version of the minimal supersymmetric standard model in this paper , however , our naturalness criteria apply equally well to other scenarios .    in the mssm , electroweak symmetry breaking proceeds through radiative effects@xcite .",
    "the 1-loop effective higgs potential may be expressed as follows @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the tree level potential , and @xmath83 represents the 1-loop correction .   was studied in ref .",
    "[ 9 ] . ] using the renormalization group , the parameters are evolved to low energies where the potential attains validity .",
    "this renormalization group improvement uncovers electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the exact low energy scale at which to minimize is unimportant as long as the 1-loop effective potential is used and the scale is in the expected electroweak range .",
    "if we arbitrarily take the minimization scale to be @xmath0 , then the two minimization conditions may be expressed as follows @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields , @xmath87 .",
    "demanding correct electroweak symmetry breaking puts constraints on the parameters of the mssm .",
    "for example , the top quark yukawa coupling is one parameter that has to be large enough in order to achieve the desired radiative breaking . rewriting eq .",
    "( 4.5 ) yields an equation for @xmath0 as a function of the parameters of the mssm @xmath88    in the mssm , the problem of fine tuning has been commonly treated using the prescription of ref .",
    "[ 1 ] , although the original bound of @xmath89 has often been increased to as high as @xmath90 .",
    "however , as already discussed , it is difficult to ascertain what constitutes a reasonable bound in the absence of some comparative norm ( normalization ) .",
    "a glaring example of this can be found in @xmath91 . when applying the criterion of ref .",
    "[ 1 ] , one typically takes the @xmath2-parameter to be a soft breaking mass , such as @xmath76 , @xmath78 , @xmath80 , etc . , or the top yukawa . however , the strong coupling is also a parameter of the theory , and one can consider @xmath92 . we find that over all the parameter space of the mssm that we have so far explored , @xmath5 is the largest for @xmath93 .",
    "since all the parameters are ostensibly on equal footing , imposing @xmath94 may be overly restrictive .",
    "we now apply the realization of @xmath23 given in eqs .",
    "( 3.5)-(3.7 ) to the mssm . to use this prescription",
    "we must specify the range of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "we could simply choose this range by _ fiat _",
    "( _ e.g. _ , @xmath95 tev ) , but this seems rather _ ad hoc_. instead we prefer that the choice of range be dictated by electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "other choices are possible .",
    "we will ask how natural the value @xmath96 gev is , given that the gauge symmetry breaking occurs correctly . for this choice",
    ", the range of @xmath2 should correspond to values for which @xmath97 is broken to @xmath98 .",
    "there are then finite limits to the range of @xmath2 that come from two conditions on the value of @xmath0",
    ". the minimum value of @xmath0 can not be less than @xmath99 , and its maximum value can not exceed some upper bound , often set by the requirement that sneutrino squared masses be positive .",
    "we display @xmath100 s computed for two different choices of @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath101 corresponding to the choice @xmath102 , and @xmath103 corresponding to @xmath104 .",
    "if we adopt t hooft s notion of naturalness that lagrangian parameters should not be small unless setting them to zero increases a symmetry , and we believe that the magnitude of supersymmetry breaking terms should be universal , we should choose @xmath102 .",
    "however , we also consider @xmath105 to study the sensitivity of our criteria to the choice of @xmath32 and to allow for non - universality in the magnitude of soft supersymmetry breaking terms ( see for example ref .",
    "figures 1 - 3 show that , in the mssm , the @xmath23 s are very insensitive to which choice of @xmath32 is made .    in figs .",
    "1a and 1b , we plot @xmath106 vs. @xmath78 for two choices of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters @xmath77 , @xmath79 , @xmath76 , and @xmath80 . on this scale , @xmath101 and @xmath103",
    "are virtually indistinguishable so we only show @xmath101 . on the same plots we show , for comparison , the traditional prescription @xmath107 as well .",
    "the range of @xmath78 corresponds to the values of the common gaugino mass for which @xmath97 is broken to @xmath98 .",
    "note that the asymptotic , `` natural '' value of @xmath107 for large @xmath78 is order ten and not order one .",
    "this is another demonstration why it is necessary to rescale the @xmath53 s to achieve a sensible measure of fine tuning .",
