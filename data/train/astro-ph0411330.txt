    "there are several analytical models of the dynamical evolution of extended powerful radio sources whose prototype is the radio galaxy cyga ( 3c405 ) .",
    "all of them are based on the hydrodynamical expansion of their lobes ( or cocoon ) caused by the interaction of light supersonic jets with the ambient material swept - up within the bow - shock arising behind the jet head , and satisfactory describe the sources dynamics . however , only two of them , the most sophisticated ones published by kaiser , dennett - thorpe and alexander ( 1997 ) [ hereafter kda ] and blundell , rawlings and willott ( 1999 ) [ hereafter brw ] , deal with the sources energetics and the radio luminosity evolution with time .",
    "these two models differ in one assumption : the kda model sustain the falle s ( 1991 ) requirement of a homologous ( self - similar ) bow - shock expansion , while in the brw one the jet - head pressure does not scale with time in the same way as cocoon pressure , hence it does not expand self - similarly .",
    "as the result , the predicted decrease of the radio luminosity of matured sources is faster in the brw model than in the kda one . besides",
    ", the self - similar bow - shock expansion would be possible only if the internal source ( cocoon ) pressure was always much higher than the external environment pressure , what has been questioned by x - ray observations of the medium surrounding selected frii - type galaxies and quasars ( e.g. hardcastle and worrall 2000 ) .",
    "therefore _ giant _ radio sources with their largest linear sizes and low luminosity are excellent objects for an observational constraint of the both models predictions .    in machalski",
    "et al . ( 2004 ) [ hereafter referred to as paper i ] we presented the sample of 18 _ giant _ lobe - dominated radio sources ( with projected linear size @xmath4 mpc if @xmath5=50 kms@xmath6mpc@xmath6 and @xmath7=1 ) and 54 normal - size sources selected to fulfill the following criteria : ( i ) the sources have the frii - type ( fanaroff and riley 1974 ) morphology , ( ii ) the existing radio maps allow a suitable determination of their lateral size transversal to the source s axis which is necessary to specify its ( so called ) ` axial ratio ' and volume , and ( iii ) their spectral age or the expansion speed , reliably determined with the same model of the energy losses , are available from the literature .    in paper",
    "i , applying the kda model chosen for its simplicity in comparison to the brw , for each member of the sample we have determined their basic physical parameters , i.e. the jet power @xmath0 , the central density of the galaxy nucleus @xmath1 , the energy density and pressure in the lobes / cocoon ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , and the total energy of the source @xmath10 .",
    "all these parameters are derived from fitting the model free parameters to the source redshift , monochromatic radio luminosity , projected size , and axial ratio , i.e. its observed parameters .",
    "next , these model and observed parameters have been used to search for conditions or circumstances under which extragalactic radio sources can reach their extremal linear extent even of a few mpc , to check the values of the internal pressure in their lobes and to compare them to the suggested external pressure in the sources environment , etc .    as a result",
    ", we argued that ( i ) the _ giant_-size sources do not form a unique class of extragalactic objects ; they are old sources with the jet power @xmath11 w evolved in a relatively low - density environment with @xmath12 kgm@xmath13 , ( ii ) an apparent increase of the lowest internal pressure value with redshift , found in the largest sources , is obscured by the intrinsic dependence of their size on age and the age on redshift , ( iii ) the ratio of the jet - head pressure expanding the source cocoon in the jet direction and the cocoon lateral pressure ( @xmath14 ) governing its axial ratio is dependent on the source s age ( as well as on the jet power ) which violates the kda model assumption of self - similar expansion of the cocoon .",
    "we showed that a departure from self - similarity for large and old sources is justified by the intrinsic correlation between their observed axial ratios and ages .",
    "this forms an independent observational support for the competitive brw model .",
    "moreover , we have realized that for a number of the sample sources the derived values of their physical parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 were very close , while their ages , luminosities , and linear sizes were significantly different .",
    "this immediately raises a question whether a proximity of the above two fundamental model parameters appears by chance or it has a real physical meaning .",
    "if the latter was true , observed luminosity and size of these sources should follow more or less the model time evolution predictions . to check this",
    "we assume that they may be considered as ` the same ' source observed at different epochs of its lifetime .",
    "hereafter we call these sources as a ` clan ' although the members of each ` clan ' have rather different redshifts",
    ". the above may arise a doubt about the density @xmath1 being constant in the kda model during the source s lifetime at a given redshift . however , there are no evidences for an evolution of galaxies density and density profile during the life of , thus the neutral assumption that such parameters are independent of redshift is commonly accepted ( cf .",
    "gopal - krishna and wiita 2001 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the galaxy halo can presumably be scaled with the mean matter - density evolution of the universe proportional to @xmath15 . to check how this effect can influence the source s parameters derived from the kda model , we have selected two giants with the largest and smallest redshift in the sample , i.e. mrc0437 - 244 and pks0319 - 454 with redshifts of 0.84 and 0.0633 , respectively ( cf .",
    "table  1 of paper  i ) . using the cosmological constants adopted in this paper , both sources have been shifted in the look - back time by their given ages ( 19 and 180 myr ,",
    "respectively ; table  2 of paper  i ) .",
    "then , we have computed the redshift at the birth - time of these giants , and recalculate their model parameters for such higher redshifts .",
    "the resultant parameters differ only very little from the original ones ( by less than 1% ) justifying the assumption that the density profile of a galaxy does not evolve during rather short lifetime of radio sources in comparison to a time - scale of the matter large structures evolution .",
    "hereafter we show that these ` clans ' appear crucial for the observational constraint of the kda model predictions of the source s time evolution presented in this paper . in section  2 the members of the three ` clans '",
    "are specified , and the evolutionary tracks of their model representation on the radio luminosity  linear size ( @xmath2 ) and energy density  total energy ( @xmath3 ) planes are calculated and compared the observational data .",
    "the results obtained , especially the necessity of a departure from self - similarity of the lobe ( cocoon ) expansion in time , are discussed in section  3 .",
    "the conclusions are given in section  4 .",
    "all dynamical models enable one to calculate evolutionary tracks of time - dependent secondary parameters of radio sources if their primary ( time - independent ) parameters are given . in the papers of kda and",
    "brw the tracks of radio luminosity @xmath16 versus linear size @xmath17 were derived for imaginary sources with assumed values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "in our approach we are able to calculate such evolutionary tracks for actual sources . the sample of radio sources used in this analysis ( cf .",
    "paper i ) consists of the four sets of sources : _ giants _ ( with @xmath211 mpc ) , normal - size high - redshift and low - redshift ( with @xmath220.5 and @xmath230.5 , respectively ) , and low - luminosity ( with @xmath24 whz@xmath6sr@xmath6 ) . in section  1",
    "the ` clans ' of sources have been introduced , i.e. the sample sources with very close values of the two fundamental parameters in the kda model , the jet power @xmath0 and central core density @xmath1 , and evidently different ages , luminosities , and axial ratios .",
    "since this dynamical model assumes constant jet power during a source lifetime , and the nucleus density @xmath1 is _ a priori _ constant , members of such a clan can be considered as ` the same ' source observed at a number of different epochs throughout its life .",
    "the observed parameters of these members can verify predictions of the model .",
    "we found 6 clans consisting of 3 , 4 or 5 sample sources fulfilling the adopted selection criterion , namely that the fitted values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 do not differ from their mean value by more than 30 % , i.e. the standard deviation from the mean is less than 0.114 in the logarithmic scale .",
    "also the redshift of members should be comparable , however in our limited sample we have accepted redshift ratios up to about 3 . leaving out three - member clans , the remaining three of six clans",
    "are marked in fig .",
    "1a and b , and their members are listed in table  1 .",
    ".members of the clans [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the mean values of log@xmath0 , log@xmath1 , and redshift in each clan are given with the standard deviations of their individual values from the mean .",
    "the members are ordered according to their increasing age . in all three clans that increase of age",
    "is accompanied with an increase of the size and total energy of the members , altogether with a decrease of their luminosity and energy density .",
    "this qualitative observational behaviour , concordant with the model expectations , is quantitatively presented in section  2.2 .      in order to check whether observed parameters of the members of a given clan are consistent with the time evolution derived from the kda model ,",
    "a fiducial source has been created for each clan .",
    "this fiducial source has @xmath0 and @xmath1 equal to the mean value of these parameters in a given clan and the evolving axial ratio of the cocoon @xmath25 [ eq.(11 ) in paper i ) . for each of the clans , a time evolution of its size @xmath26 , luminosity @xmath27 , energy density @xmath28 , and total energy @xmath29 have been calculated .",
    "the predicted @xmath26 tracks for the three clans are shown in fig .",
    "2a with the dotted lines .",
    "the solid lines connect members of each clan drawn with different symbols .",
    "the data points are shown with error bars ( the errors in size are usually smaller than the vertical size of symbols ) .",
    "the dashed line indicates @xmath26 for the constant advance speed of 0.1@xmath30 .",
    "the higher slopes of the modelled tracks with respect to this constant speed seem to indicate a slowly accelerating expansion of the cocoon in the clans investigated , however the effect is of low significance because of uncertainties of the age .",
    "more extensive discussion of the above effect is given in section  2.3 .",
    "the time evolution of the total energy predicted with the kda model for the three clans is shown in figure  2b with the dotted lines .",
    "the short solid lines indicate the best power - law fit to the data points .",
    "a correspondence between the model @xmath29 and the data points is satisfactory .",
    "the evolutionary tracks of the fiducial source for the three clans are shown in figure  3 .",
    "the members of separate clans are marked by different symbols as in figure  2a and 2b .",
    "the actual age of each source is indicated by the number in a vicinity of each symbol .",
    "the dashed curves show the tracks calculated from the original kda model , i.e. with a constant @xmath31 taken as the mean of axial ratios in a given clan .",
    "it is clearly seen that these fits are unsatisfactory .",
    "therefore , we make the second run of the fits with the kda model but modified by substitution of @xmath32 in the formula of kaiser ( 2000 ) @xmath33    used in paper i , by our empirical formula for the age - dependent @xmath34 ( cf .",
    "paper i ) . hence    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is expressed in [ yr ] .",
    "this is consistent with the formalism used in the brw model in which the injection spectral index is governed by the breaks in the energy distribution of the particles injected into the cocoon from the hotspot instead of the constant index of @xmath37 in the kda model .",
    "the modified tracks , marked with the solid curves , show that the evolving @xmath31 much better fits the observed changes of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the markers of the same age on these tracks are connected with a dotted line .",
    "further discussion of the best fit tracks is given in section  3.1 .",
    "the model also allows one to predict the evolution of a source on the energy density  total energy plane .",
    "these tracks are shown in figure  4 with dashed curves calculated with the original kda model and the solid ones with the modified model .",
    "as in figure 3 , the age markers are connected with dotted lines , and the member sources of each clan are indicated with the same symbols .",
    "note that the ordinate of every source is its equipartition energy density derived from the observational data , while the tracks show the _ model _ cocoon energy density .",
    "this is an additional argument that the modified model better reproduce the observational data . in figure  4 , an uncertainty of the values of both parameters",
    "is shown by the error bars .",
    "the error of @xmath38 is given in paper i ( table  2 ) and the error of @xmath10 is estimated from the error of source volume ( in table  1 there ) .",
    "again , the numbers mark the actual age of the corresponding source .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the modified evolutionary @xmath39@xmath10 tracks are steeper and curved in respect to those expected from the original model .",
    "this effect , related to the rate of adiabatic losses and inflation of the cocoon , is also discussed in section 3.1 .",
    "the data show that the source ( cocoon ) geometry , described by its axial ratio , depends on its estimated age . in sections 2.3 and 2.4",
    "we have presented the evolutionary tracks of the ` fiducial ' sources across the @xmath16@xmath17 and @xmath38@xmath10 planes , respectively , calculated with incorporation of the cocoon axial ratio evolving with time into the analytical kda model",
    ". a predicted evolution of each fiducial source , i.e. its tracks across the above planes , is verified by the age , luminosity , size , and the energy of a clan members ( cf .",
    "section  2.2 ) .",
    "therefore , we consider those sources as an individual source observed at different lifetime epochs , and the relevant fiducial source is its model representation",
    ".    figures  3 and 4 show that for each of the three clans our tracks are steeper than those resulting from the original kda model , and much better corresponds to the observed parameters of the clan sources .",
    "our @xmath16@xmath17 tracks strictly resemble those published by blundell et al .",
    ", as both arise from the dynamical models without assumption of the self - similar evolution of the source cocoon .",
    "also the tracks of our clans across the @xmath38@xmath10 plane are steeper than those predicted by the original kda model for sources with constant axial ratios .",
    "moreover , the steepening increases throughout the source lifetime .",
    "this is provided with the time - dependent @xmath40 ratio and non - constant inflation of the cocoon applied in our analysis .    in the kda model",
    "the synchrotron emitting particles flow from the jet head into the lobe ( cocoon ) whose pressures are in a constant ratio throughout the sources lifetime . thus the adiabatic losses in this model do not increase with time . in the brw model",
    "the population of emitting particles adiabatically leave the constant - pressure hotspot area into the cocoon whose pressure decreases throughout the sources lifetime causing the losses due to its adiabatic expansion increase with time .",
    "it is interesting that we get similar tracks from a different approach , subsequently supporting predictions of their model .",
    "the observed distributions of the clan sources across the @xmath16@xmath17 and @xmath38@xmath10 planes give further arguments after the necessity of accounting for the evolving axial ratio of the cocoon in studies of the dynamical evolution of individual radio sources , and allow to conclude that a departure from the self similar expansion in large and old sources is very probable .",
    "all the analyzed clans include _ giant _ sources , thus a dynamical evolution of radio sources from typical ( ` normal ' ) size to ` giant ' size is in accordance with predictions of the analytical kda and brw models .",
    "this supports our statistical findings that giants are old sources with high enough jet power evolved in relatively low - density environment .",
    "the expansion speed of the cocoon along the jet axis can be directly derived dividing length of the jet [ equation ( 1 ) in paper i ] by time .",
    "indicating @xmath41 we have    @xmath42    in the above relation , taken directly from the kda model , an acceleration of the cocoon expansion speed is admitted if @xmath43 .",
    "the value assumed in paper i @xmath19=1.5 implies @xmath44 .",
    "however this relation is valid for the cocoon self - similar expansion only .",
    "as there is a doubt about validity of this assumption for the large and old radio sources , the expansion speed can rather be derived from the cocoon time - evolving volume of cylindrical geometry given by    @xmath45^{3}\\propto t^{9/(5-\\beta ) } g^{3/(5-\\beta)}.\\ ] ]    ( cf . equation ( 6 ) in paper i ) .",
    "inserting @xmath46 and @xmath47 into equation ( 1 ) and taking 1/3 root of it , we have @xmath48 .",
    "but the sample statistics indicate that @xmath31 also evolve with time and the ratio of @xmath49 . substituting    @xmath50",
    "obtained from fitting a surface to the values of @xmath31 over the @xmath36@xmath51 plane and @xmath52 into equation ( 1 ) , then dividing it by @xmath36 , now we have    @xmath53    the negative power exponent of @xmath36 still implies the cocoon expansion - speed deceleration with time , though slower than that for the self - similarity expanding cocoon .    nevertheless , a slow _ acceleration _ effect is seen in the time evolution of the _ fiducial _ sources representing the clans of a few actual sample sources in which each source in the clan with almost identical values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is observed at a different age ( cf .",
    "section  2.2 and figure  2a ) .",
    "below we analyse whether it can be real .",
    "independent arguments after an accelerated expansion come from the well known hydrodynamical considerations . from scheuer ( 1974 )",
    ", it has commonly been accepted that the ram pressure of the external gas behind the head of jet is    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the external density , @xmath56 is the head working surface area , and the jet bulk velocity @xmath57 is commonly assumed to be close to the light speed @xmath30 . in this approach",
    "@xmath58 is a function of the root square of the ratio @xmath59 and the reciprocal of the linear size ( diameter ) of the working area .",
    "@xmath59 simply represents an effectiveness of the jet propagation across the surrounding medium .",
    "we can consider this ratio at the core radius @xmath18 and at the source leading head where it is @xmath49 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "both ratios are derived from the model .",
    "values of the first ratio for _ giant _ sources are not very different from those for other sample sources being little smaller than corresponding values for high - redshift sources , comparable with those for low - redshift sources , and evidently higher from those for low - luminosity ones .",
    "the second ratio , as a function of @xmath61 , is the highest for _ giant _ sources .",
    "the area @xmath56 at a given radius from the agn centre can be determined from high - resolution observations of the hotspots .",
    "for example , vlbi observations of selected ` compact symmetric objects ' ( cso ) , possibly progenitors of classical double fri and/or frii sources give a linear size of the working area of about a few parsecs at a radius of about 50@xmath62100 pc ( cf .",
    "owsianik et al .",
    "many vla observations of hotspots in sources of size 10@xmath6220 kpc show that their sizes are not larger than about 500 pc , while the hotspot sizes in the lobes of large sources do not exceed 15 kpc .",
    "schoenmakers et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in their study of _ giant _ radio sources have assumed a typical hotspot size of 5 kpc at a radius of @xmath63 mpc . after the discovery of the third largest radio galaxy j1343 + 3758 ( 1343 + 379 in tables  1 and 2 ) , machalski and jamrozy ( 2000 ) determined a working surface area with a diameter of @xmath6413 kpc in one of its lobes .    from the data in our sample sources we have @xmath65 wm@xmath66 kg@xmath6 and @xmath67 wm@xmath66 kg@xmath6 . dividing the first ratio by @xmath68 m@xmath69 ( the working area for a hotspot diameter of 0.5@xmath700.1 kpc ) and the second ratio by @xmath71 m@xmath69 ( for a hotspot diameter of 10@xmath704 kpc ) , we obtain @xmath58 of 0.12 and 0.19@xmath30 , respectively , which confirms a possible acceleration of the cocoon expansion speed .",
    "the above speeds , too high with respect to an upper limit of @xmath58 ( i.e. the quotient @xmath72 ) , can be caused by either an overestimation of the jet power or too low internal density of the core and of the external density at the end of jet .",
    "an adjustment of @xmath19 will not work because some increase of @xmath19 can compensate for too low @xmath1 , but will dramatically lower @xmath73 .",
    "since the values of @xmath56 adopted for this calculation may be overestimated rather than underestimated , only a decrease of @xmath0 can fit the observed expansion speeds .",
    "indeed , the values of @xmath0 derived from equation ( 3 ) base on the ram pressure considerations in the overpressured source model a of scheuer ( 1974 ) and its further modifications ( e.g. begelman and cioffi 1989 ; loken et al . 1992 ; nath 1995 ) .",
    "they all are self - similar models of the carvaldo and odea ( 2002 ) type i which describe the source dynamics only .",
    "if the source energetics and especially the energy losses are taken into account ( the type iii models ; e.g. kda , brw ) , the significantly higher values of @xmath0 are implied . therefore , the above calculation of @xmath58 values must be based on @xmath0 values determined within the same dynamical model of type i. if this is the case , the controversy about too high expansion speeds will disappear . using the nath s ( 1995 ) model in which 100% of the twin - jets energy is converted into radiation ( i.e. @xmath74 )",
    ", we find that @xmath0 values fitted with that model are about ten times lower than the kda values .",
    "therefore , the @xmath58 values calculated as above but with the @xmath0(nath ) values decrease to about 0.04 and 0.06@xmath30 , i.e. to the expansion velocities quite plausible .",
    "the following conclusions can be drawn from the above analysis :    \\(1 ) the sample sources , having similar model parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 but different age , size , axial ratio and luminosity ( called a ` clan ' ) , fit satisfactory the modified kaiser et al.s ( 1997 ) [ kda ] model tracks on the @xmath2 and @xmath75 planes calculated for a ` fiducial ' source being the model representation of each clan .",
    "the derived tracks appear to be much steeper than those provided by the original kda model ; the best fit is achieved by allowing an evolution of the sources cocoon axial ratio with time .",
    "the derived tracks are compatible with those expected from the more sophisticated blundell et al.s ( 1999 ) model .",
    "\\(3 ) in the case of clan sources , we found a slow acceleration of the average expansion speed of the cocoon along the jet axis .",
    "this effect is predicted with the model modified as above , and is caused by a systematic increase of the ratio between hotspot and cocoon pressures ( @xmath40 ) with the age of source and decreasing density of the external environment according to the king s law model .",
    "the statistics suggest that this acceleration is also dependent on an efficiency of the jet propagation through the surrounding medium ."
