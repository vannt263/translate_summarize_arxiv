    "electrical spin injection and extraction in ge have been recently investigated in lateral spin - transport devices with various doping profiles using nonlocal@xcite and local@xcite hanle measurements , as well as in heterostructure and nanostructure devices.@xcite similar to direct band - gap semiconductors , optical orientation is an additional viable tool to investigate spin properties of electrons and holes in ge.@xcite unlike silicon , optical orientation in ge is efficient because of the energy proximity between the direct and indirect gaps .",
    "spin - polarized electrons are first photoexcited to the @xmath6  valley and then they relax via ultrafast spin conserving scattering to the conduction band edges in one of the four @xmath3  valleys ( located @xmath4140  mev below the zone center @xmath6-valley).@xcite    theoretical efforts in the early days@xcite were motivated by low - temperature electron spin resonance experiments that studied the @xmath7 factor and spin - lattice relaxation of localized electrons in donor states.@xcite on the other hand , little attention was paid to conduction electrons whose spin relaxation is mediated by the elliott - yafet mechanism.@xcite by analyzing the space inversion and time reversal symmetries of the @xmath3 point , yafet deduced a @xmath8 temperature dependence of the spin relaxation rate due to intravalley electron scattering with acoustic phonons.@xcite kalashnikov extended yafet s theory to various statistical distributions and scattering mechanisms.@xcite chazalviel investigated spin flips due to electron - impurity scattering using effective spin - orbit coupling parameters that resemble the treatment in iii - v semiconductors.@xcite most recently , tang _",
    "et al . _ have used a tight - binding model to calculate the intrinsic spin relaxation of conduction electrons in strained ge.@xcite    in this paper , we present a theory of spin - flip processes due to electron - phonon scattering in ge .",
    "two distinctive contributions are present in this work .",
    "first , we find the spin orientation dependence of spin - flip matrix elements .",
    "this dependence leads to anisotropy in spin relaxation and it is instrumental in analyzing measurements where the orientation of injected spins is set by the shape and magnetocrystalline anisotropy of ferromagnetic contacts or by the propagation and helicity of a circularly - polarized light beam .",
    "an interesting result of the analysis is that most of the intrinsic spin relaxation of conduction electrons in ge can be explained by coupling of the lowest conduction band to the upper conduction bands ( rather than to the upper valence bands which is the typical case in most semiconductors ) .",
    "the second contribution of this work is the derivation of a spin - dependent @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 hamiltonian in the vicinity of the @xmath3 point ( conduction band edge ) .",
    "this compact hamiltonian model exquisitely captures the signature of spin - orbit interaction on electronic states and it can be extended to study confined ge structures using an expanded basis of envelope functions.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : general ] discusses the symmetry of wavefunctions and their effects on spin - flip processes .",
    "section [ sec : iii ] provides a quantitative discussion of intervalley spin flips due to scattering with zone - edge phonons .",
    "using group theory , we derive the spin - flip matrix elements and calculate the resulting spin lifetime . a comparison with numerical calculations is also provided . in sec . [ sec : iv ] the method of invariants@xcite is used to construct a spin - dependent @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 hamiltonian around the @xmath3  point .",
    "we solve this hamiltonian to get the energy bands and spin - dependent wavefunctions .",
    "this information is then used in sec .",
    "[ sec : v ] to study intravalley spin flips due to scattering with long - wavelength acoustic phonons . section [ sec : vi ]",
    "summarizes our findings .",
    "spin flips during an electron scattering are described by the matrix element @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the scattering interaction and @xmath11 are the spin - up and spin - down states . in a multivalley conduction band",
    "this scattering represents an _ intravalley _ or an _ intervalley _ process depending on whether the electron wavevectors @xmath0 and @xmath12 reside in the same or different valley(s ) , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : band](a ) shows the four valleys in the conduction band edge of ge .",
    "if the crystal possesses an inversion center then each band at wavevector @xmath0 is spin degenerate and we can define its states with respect to the spin orientation @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the band index . in the following",
    "we omit this index and deal only with the lowest conduction band .",

    "the analysis relies on their transformation properties under symmetry operations",
    ".    points .",
    "( b )   band structure of ge along high - symmetry crystallographic axes .",
    "the conduction - band edge is indicated by the irreducible representation @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) in single ( double ) group notation.@xcite [ fig : band],width=340 ]    representations of conduction ( valence ) states in the @xmath3  point have even ( odd ) parity under space inversion operation . in the notation of single group theory , there are 6 irreducible representations ( ir ) of the @xmath3  point space group.@xcite the lowest conduction band is non - degenerate and belongs to @xmath20 ( a one - dimensional ir ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : band](b ) shows that nearby bands are pairs of valence and conduction bands .",
    "they are represented , respectively , by the two - dimensional irs @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "if the crystal potential is vanishingly small then the @xmath3  point energies of these five bands ( @xmath20 , @xmath23 and @xmath22 ) are degenerate .",
    "however , the crystal potential in ge splits these bands into three sets and the relatively large energy separation from @xmath20 will be shown to result in a very slow intravalley spin relaxation process . in comparison",
    ", the six conduction band valleys in si are located close ( in energy and wavevector ) to the two - band degeneracy at the @xmath24  point .",
    "this degeneracy leads to a spin hot - spot along certain directions in the square boundary faces of the brillouin zone,@xcite and to a unique behavior of intravalley spin relaxation in si.@xcite this distinct difference between si and ge merits independent treatments of the spin relaxation .",
    "the wavefunctions of conduction electrons , @xmath25 , include small contributions from states of remote bands . in the @xmath0@xmath26@xmath2 theory",
    "there are two first - order terms related to signatures of the spin - orbit interaction , @xmath27 @xmath28 transforms as a polar vector ( @xmath29 ) and can couple between odd and even states . in our case ,",
    "the coupling is between states of @xmath20 and @xmath22 symmetries that represent , respectively , the lowest conduction band and upper valence bands . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath30 transforms as an axial vector ( @xmath31 ) and can couple the even states of @xmath20 and @xmath23 ( lowest and upper conduction bands ) .",
    "the dimensionality of @xmath22 or @xmath23 ( 2d irs ) is such that each is coupled to @xmath20 by two components of a vector that lie perpendicular to the valley axis [ i.e. , parallel to the hexagonal boundary faces at the zone edge ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : band](a ) ] .    the aforementioned @xmath32-independent coupling between @xmath20 and @xmath23 zone - edge states can be used to find new eigenstates that diagonalize the @xmath3 point hamiltonian ( @xmath0=0 ) in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , @xmath33 are @xmath32-independent parameters , @xmath34 is the opposite spin direction of @xmath35 , and @xmath36 denotes @xmath37 . slightly away from the valley center ,",
    "the signature of @xmath23 on conduction electronic states outweighs the signature of @xmath22 via @xmath28 ( since @xmath38 where @xmath0 is measured from the @xmath3 point and @xmath39 is the lattice constant ) .",
    "this property implies stronger spin - orbit coupling with the upper conduction bands than with the upper valence bands .",
    "therefore , we start with a study of the intervalley spin relaxation where the effect of @xmath30 enters at the lowest order ( the spin - flip amplitude does not depend on relative value of the wavevectors with respect to their valley centers ) .",
    "the intervalley scattering in ge is governed by electron interaction with zone - edge phonons close to the @xmath24  point .",
    "for example , the @xmath40 and @xmath41 valley centers [ @xmath42 are connected by the wavevector @xmath43 [ @xmath44 .",
    "these zone - edge phonons belong to three 2d irs : @xmath45 ( ta , 10 mev ) , @xmath46 ( la & lo , 29 mev ) and @xmath47 ( to ,  33  mev),@xcite with their polarizations and energies written in the parentheses .",
    "if the transition involves valleys that we denote by @xmath3 and @xmath48 , then the selection rule for electron scattering reads @xmath49 where @xmath45 is forbidden by time reversal symmetry.@xcite    including the spin degree of freedom , it is convenient to use double group theory where @xmath50 is replaced by @xmath51 .",

    "is excluded at the lowest order by time reversal symmetry .",
