    "for many years it was thought that radiative losses via x - ray emission in galaxy clusters leads to a substantial inflow of gas , and mass dropout , in the form of a `` cooling flow '' ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "mass deposition rates were estimated to be as much as several hundred @xmath1 in some clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , there was little direct evidence for the mass dropout in any band other than x - rays @xcite .",
    "recent high resolution x - ray data from _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ indicate that there is no evidence for the multi - temperature gas that one expects if there is substantial mass dropout ( @xcite ) .",
    "the new data strongly suggest that mass dropout must be prevented by some additional source of heat that balances radiative losses .",
    "two possibilities are currently being investigated for the heat source : ( i ) energy in jets , outflows , and radiation from a central active galactic nucleus ( @xcite ) , and ( ii ) thermal energy from outer regions of the cluster transported to the central cooling gas by conduction ( @xcite , hereafter nm01 ) .",
    "conduction in clusters has been discussed by several authors over the years in various contexts @xcite , but its importance was always considered doubtful . for conduction to have any significant effect on the cooling gas in a cluster , the effective isotropic coefficient of conduction @xmath0 has to be a reasonable fraction of the classical @xcite conductivity @xmath2 .",
    "however , conventional wisdom is that magnetic fields strongly suppress conduction perpendicular to the field .",
    "therefore , while conduction may be very efficient parallel to the field , the overall isotropic @xmath0 is expected to be @xmath3 .",
    "this picture has changed with the recent work of nm01 who , following earlier work by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , showed that a turbulent mhd medium in which the fluctuation spectrum extends over two or more decades of spatial scales has an effective @xmath0 that is a substantial fraction of @xmath2 .",
    "this is because of chaotic transverse wandering of field lines as a result of strong mhd turbulence @xcite , which leads to a large enhancement of cross - field diffusion .",
    "nm01 estimated that the ratio @xmath4 in a turbulent mhd medium is approximately @xmath5 , though , given the uncertainties in their model , the value could probably lie anywhere in the range @xmath6 .",
    "nm01 showed via a simple order - of - magnitude estimate that thermal conduction with @xmath7 is sufficient to balance the radiative losses of the cooling gas in x - ray clusters .",
    "based on this , they suggested that conduction might be a large part of the explanation for the lack of mass dropout in x - ray clusters .",
    "their suggestion finds support in the work of @xcite and @xcite who show that conduction with @xmath8 in the range @xmath9 can indeed be a dominant heat source in x - ray clusters except perhaps in the very central regions .    the aim of the present paper is to study conduction in galaxy clusters in more detail .",
    "our goals are two - fold .",
    "first , we consider a very simple model in which the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium and in thermal balance , with cooling exactly compensated by heat conduction .",
    "we investigate whether this basic model can fit the observed shapes of the electron density profile @xmath10 and temperature profile @xmath11 of clusters for which high - resolution observations are available .",
    "we believe this approach , which is complementary to that of @xcite , is a good test of the conduction hypothesis , and a reliable method of estimating what value of @xmath8 is needed in various clusters to explain the observations .",
    "second , having found a steady state model for a given cluster , we check whether the hot gas is thermally stable .",
    "we briefly discuss the importance and plausibility of other energy sources .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we write down the relevant differential equations and boundary conditions for a steady equilibrium model of hot gas in a cluster . in ",
    "3 we compare model predictions with data on 10 clusters , and in  4 we discuss the thermal stability of the gas in these clusters .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in  5 . throughout the paper , we take @xmath12 km sec@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , rescaling observational results whenever the original papers have used a different cosmology for their analysis .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric cluster containing hot gas in equilibrium with no inflow .",
    "the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium gives @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gas density , @xmath18 is the pressure , and @xmath19 is the gravitational potential .",
    "we assume that gas pressure dominates and that magnetic fields have a negligible dynamical effect , so that @xmath20 where @xmath11 is the temperature of the gas , @xmath10 is the electron number density , @xmath21 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath22 is the molecular weight per electron , @xmath23 is the atomic mass unit , and @xmath24 is the isothermal sound speed of the gas .",
    "we assume that the gas has hydrogen fraction @xmath25 and helium fraction @xmath26 , so that @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( taking hydrogen and helium to be fully ionized ) .",
    "the energy equation of the gas is a simple balance between radiative cooling and heating by thermal conduction .",
    "thus , in steady state , we have @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the heat flux due to electron conduction and @xmath32 is the rate of radiative cooling per unit volume of the gas .",
    "we assume that the conductivity of the gas @xmath0 is a fixed fraction @xmath8 of the classical @xcite conductivity .",
    "thus , @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the usual coulomb logarithm . in the relevant range of temperatures",
    "the gas cools primarily by thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "we therefore write @xcite @xmath36 where the numerical coefficient corresponds to the particular gas composition that we have assumed ; the coefficient also includes an average gaunt factor .",
    "the gravitational acceleration @xmath37 due to the mass in the cluster is obtained by solving poisson s equation , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the density distribution of the dark matter , which we assume has the nfw form @xcite with a softened core : @xmath40 here , @xmath41 is the standard scale radius of the nfw profile , @xmath42 is a core radius inside which the density becomes constant , and @xmath43 is a characteristic mass ( e.g. , if @xmath44 , the mass inside a sphere of radius @xmath41 is @xmath45 ) .",
    "we relate the parameters of the nfw profile to the temperature @xmath46 of the hydrostatic gas at @xmath47 , well outside the cooling region of the cluster .",
    "we use the mass - temperature relation from @xcite and the mass - scale relation from @xcite , so that , once we know @xmath46 , we can estimate the virial mass @xmath48 and @xmath41 .",
    "the former is defined as the mass inside the radius within which the mean density of the dark matter is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the critical density of the universe at the redshift of the cluster : @xmath51 .",
    "the normalization of the nfw profile is then obtained via a simple calculation : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the concentration parameter : @xmath54 it is interesting that simulations of cluster formation allow us almost completely to determine the cluster potential from a single observed number , @xmath46 .",
    "the only remaining uncertainty is the shape of the density distribution in the very inner regions of the cluster , which we parametrize through the core radius @xmath42 .",
    "the value of the core radius @xmath42 is somewhat uncertain .",
    "it is zero in the original nfw model , but cluster lensing studies @xcite suggest that it may be tens of kpc in some clusters . as explained in  3 below , we try two values of @xmath42 : @xmath44 and @xmath55",
    ".    equations ( [ hydro ] ) , ( [ energy ] ) , ( [ heatflux ] ) and ( [ poisson ] ) are four ordinary differential equations for the four variables @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath31 and @xmath37 .",
    "we solve these equations numerically between @xmath56 and @xmath57 with the following four boundary conditions .",
    "two boundary conditions are taken directly from the observations of a given cluster , namely the temperature @xmath58 at the cluster center and @xmath59 .",
    "for @xmath46 we use the observed temperature at around @xmath47 , which is well outside the cooling region in the center .",
    "the other two boundary conditions are @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the the mass ( dark matter plus gas ) inside radius @xmath63 .",
    "we note that we make a slight approximation by assuming a perfect steady state . in real clusters with conductive heating ,",
    "the energy for the cooling ultimately comes from gravity and so the gas in the cluster must slowly settle in the gravitational potential .",
    "this effect would be accentuated by conduction to the outside , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "we do not include gravitational settling in our model .",
    "instead , we assume that the outer regions of the cluster behave like an infinite isothermal heat source at a temperature of @xmath46 .",
    "we have experimented with different radii for the outer boundary of our models , from @xmath64 to @xmath65 , and find that the results are not sensitive to this choice .",
    "the models discussed below correspond to @xmath57 .",
    "we have analysed the following 10 clusters for which high angular resolution data are available from _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ or both : a1795 , a1835 , a2052 , a2199 , a2390 , a2597 , hydra a , rxj 1347.5 - 1145 , ser 159 - 03 , and 3c295 .",
    "table 1 lists the relevant parameters for each cluster . in the case of several of these clusters ,",
    "deprojected density and temperature profiles are available , and we have used them in our modeling . in a few cases , however (",
    "a2597 , a2052 , hydra a , ser 159 - 03 ) , the original authors have not published deprojected profiles , and we had to use the un - deprojected data . given the observational uncertainties , deprojection only affects the profiles in the innermost regions of the cluster , within about 30 kpc . on the other hand ,",
    "our model solutions only depend slightly on the inner temperature .",
    "therefore , we believe that the shapes of the profiles are essentially the same outside about 30 kpc , whether we use deprojected or un - deprojected temperatures .    table 1 lists for each cluster the inner and outer temperatures , @xmath66 and @xmath46 , which were used as boundary conditions in the modeling .",
    "it also lists the parameters of the nfw profile of the dark matter , which were estimated from @xmath46 as described in  2 .",
    "the last column gives references to the original publications for the x - ray data .",
    "we carried out the modeling as follows .",
    "we first assumed that the core radius @xmath44 and selected a value of @xmath8 ( say 0.2 ) .",
    "we adjusted the inner density @xmath67 of the gas such that on integrating the four differential equations ( [ hydro ] ) , ( [ energy ] ) , ( [ heatflux ] ) and ( [ poisson ] ) from @xmath56 to @xmath57 , the model temperature agreed with the measured outer temperature @xmath46 .",
    "we then compared the model profiles of @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the data ; we restricted ourselves to a comparison by eye since neither the deprojected data nor the models are reliable enough for a detailed @xmath68 fit . if the fit was not satisfactory , we tried other values of @xmath8 .",
    "if no value of @xmath8 gave a satisfactory fit , we repeated the process by setting @xmath69 ( the ratio 20 was selected to be consistent with estimates from lensing ; the solutions are insensitive to the exact value . ) for most clusters , we obtained a good fit for some choice of @xmath8 and one of the two values of @xmath42 we tried .",
    "the values of the best - fit parameters are listed in table 2 .",
    "we consider a model to be acceptable if the model profiles of @xmath10 and @xmath11 agree well with the data and if the required value of @xmath8 lies within the range @xmath70 predicted by theory ( nm01 ) . by this criterion , 5 of the 10 clusters we studied",
    "are consistent with a pure thermal conduction model : a1795 , a1835 , a2199 , a2390 , and rxj 1347.5 - 1145 .",
    "figures 1 , 2 and 3 show the fits for three of these clusters ( a1795 , a2199 and a2390 ) .",
    "we consider the good agreement between the model and the data encouraging since the model has very few adjustable parameters .",
    "note in particular that our primary adjustable parameter @xmath8 affects only the overall normalization of @xmath10 , but has no effect on the shapes of either @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "the fact that the model curves agree well with the data is thus a significant result . to our knowledge , this kind of modeling of the shapes of profiles has not been reported before .",
    "there is a slight inconsistency in the density profile below 10 kpc in a2199 ( and also rxj 1347.5 - 1145 ) , but this is hardly surprising since the central galaxy is likely to introduce large perturbations to our assumed nfw profile in this region .    of the 5 clusters for which we obtain acceptable models , we note that a1835 is a complicated case because the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton",
    "_ data do not agree with each other ; indeed , @xcite has shown that there are problems with the analysis of both datasets .",
    "we obtain a reasonable model for this cluster if we use the density profile from _ xmm - newton _",
    "data @xcite corrected for flares . for a1795 , although both _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "data sets are available @xcite we do not use the _ xmm - newton _ temperature profile because it is un - deprojected .",
    "the remaining 5 clusters , a2052 , a2597 , hydra a , ser 159 - 03 and 3c295 , all require large values of @xmath8 , generally greater than unity .",
    "since such values are unphysical , we conclude that these clusters must have some other source of energy in addition to thermal conduction .",
    "heating from a central active galactic nucleus is a promising possibility @xcite .",
    "the idea is supported by the fact that all these clusters possess strong active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in their centers which are also all powerful extended radio sources ( 3c317 in a2052 , pks2322 - 122 in a2597 , 3c218 in hydra a , pmnj2313 - 4243 in sersic 159 - 03 , and the cluster 3c295 is named after the radio source in its center ) .",
    "strong extended radio emission is indicative of powerful outflows interacting with the intracluster medium ( e.g. @xcite ) . in contrast , of the 5 well - fit clusters , only two ( a1795 and a2199 ) are known to have strong extended radio sources in their centers ( 4c26.42 and 3c338 , respectively ) .",
    "mass inflow and dropout is , of course , another possible source of energy , as has been discussed for many years in the context of cooling flows .",
    "however , as mentioned in  1 , spectroscopic analyses of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data of several clusters have failed to find any evidence for the multi - phase gas expected if there is significant mass inflow and dropout .",
    "the observations place an upper limit on the mass accretion rate in a few clusters of about 10 - 20% of the nominal value needed to explain the observed x - ray flux ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "accretion at this level can not substantially modify the energy balance , so one needs either conduction or mechanical energy from an agn to fit the observations .",
    "we have computed models with larger levels of mass accretion , at the level of hundreds of @xmath71 yr@xmath13 , and we do find that accretion can then explain the x - ray data .",
    "although the details of accretion and energy release during the mass dropout are uncertain ( see different versions of energy balance in @xcite and @xcite ) , we find that we can reproduce the observed density and temperature profiles with reasonable assumptions .",
    "to analyze the stability of the steady - state solutions described in  3 , we work with the full time - dependent equations .",
    "equation ( [ hydro ] ) generalizes to the euler equation , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the gas velocity .",
    "we also have the continuity equation , @xmath74 the energy equation ( [ energy ] ) now becomes the time - dependent entropy equation , @xmath75 = -j -{\\bf \\nabla}\\cdot{\\bf f } + q^+ , \\label{entropy}\\ ] ] where the specific entropy @xmath76 of the gas is defined in terms of the specific internal energy @xmath77 and specific enthalpy @xmath78 by @xmath79 for an ideal gas , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the adiabatic index and @xmath82 is the isothermal sound speed ( eq .  [ pressure ] ) . in our calculations , we set @xmath83 .    for completeness , we have included in equation ( [ entropy ] ) a heating term @xmath84 in addition to the term due to thermal conduction .",
    "this term may refer , for instance , to heating from a central agn .",
    "we assume that the heating rate per unit volume has a power - law dependence on the density , @xmath85    the heat flux equation ( [ heatflux ] ) and the poisson equation ( [ poisson ] ) are still valid , except that we generalize them to include non - spherical perturbations : @xmath86 @xmath87    the above five equations , ( [ euler ] ) , ( [ continuity ] ) , ( [ entropy ] ) , ( [ heatflux2 ] ) and ( [ poisson2 ] ) , describe the general time - dependent evolution of the gas .",
    "note that , while we include the effect of a turbulent magnetic field on conduction through the parameter @xmath88 in equation ( [ spitzer ] ) , we do not include magnetic pressure or tension in the euler equation ( see @xcite for a discussion of these effects ) .    for the stability analysis",
    ", we take a steady state spherical solution of the equations , e.g. , one of the cluster models described in  3 , and consider local linear perturbations of the solution within the wkb approximation ; that is , we assume that the perturbations are small and are proportional to @xmath89 . @xcite has shown that radial perturbations , with wavevector @xmath90 parallel to the local direction of gravity , are not well - described by a local analysis ; these perturbations also do not show thermal instability . in the following we therefore consider only tangential perturbations , with @xmath90 and the corresponding @xmath91 taken to be in a tangential direction with respect to the radius vector .",
    "we carry out the linear stability analysis in the standard way ; see @xcite for a classic treatment of the thermal stability problem . in brief",
    ", we linearize the equations , substitute perturbations of the form @xmath89 and derive the dispersion relation for the mode frequency @xmath92 .",
    "if any of the solutions for @xmath92 has a positive imaginary part , the corresponding mode grows with time and the system is unstable .",
    "if all modes for all allowed values of @xmath90 have @xmath93 , we say that the system is stable .    before presenting the results",
    ", we note that there are several physical effects present in this problem , each with a characteristic frequency or time scale .",
    "in addition to the acoustic frequency @xmath94 , we have frequencies associated with gravity ( jeans frequency @xmath95 ) , cooling ( @xmath96 ) and heating ( @xmath97 ) , and a characteristic time scale associated with conduction ( @xmath98 ) : @xmath99 each of the parameters , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , has been defined in such a way that the parameter goes to 0 as the corresponding physical effect becomes negligible .",
    "we discuss first a simple case in which we assume that conduction is negligible ( @xmath100 ) and , for simplicity , we ignore self - gravity ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "energy balance of the equilibrium system requires @xmath102 , and thus @xmath103 . assuming that @xmath84 and @xmath104 scale with density and temperature as in equations ( [ heating ] ) and ( [ cooling ] ) , and taking @xmath83",
    ", we then obtain the following dispersion relation for @xmath92 : @xmath105 by inspection we see that one of the solutions for @xmath92 is always positive imaginary if @xmath106 .",
    "thus , if @xmath106 , the system is always thermally unstable .",
    "physically , we expect many heating mechanisms to be described by @xmath107 in the range between 0 ( constant heating rate per unit volume ) and 1 ( constant heating rate per unit mass ) .",
    "according to equation ( [ dispersion1 ] ) , such systems will be thermally unstable .",
    "this suggests that models which try to solve the cooling flow problem by invoking local heating @xcite may still have some difficulties .",
    "while they allow equilibrium configurations , the equilibria they obtain are likely to be unstable . unless the heating occurs preferentially in high density regions , with an index @xmath108 ( which seems implausible )",
    ", these models require thermal conduction or some other agency for stability .",
    "we move next to the problem of interest to this paper , namely models in which cooling is balanced entirely by heat conduction ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the dispersion relation now takes the form ( again setting @xmath83 ) @xmath110 analysis of this dispersion relation shows that an instability is present only when the condition @xmath111 is satisfied .",
    "we see that , as expected ( e.g. , medvedev & narayan 2002 ) , conduction eliminates the thermal instability for short wavelength modes . physically , the reason is that the shorter the wavelength the larger the temperature gradient for a given mode amplitude ; since conduction tries to iron out temperature fluctuations and the conductive flux is proportional to the temperature gradient , short wavelength modes are stabilized . for long wavelengths ,",
    "however , sound waves can no longer stabilize the gravitational jeans instability , and ( finite ) conduction can not stabilize the thermal instability .",
    "this is the physical meaning of the upper limit on @xmath90 given in equation ( [ instability ] ) .",
    "let us denote the critical wavevector for instability by @xmath112 and the corresponding wavelength by @xmath113 .",
    "the relevant question is the following : can an unstable mode with wavelength @xmath114 or larger fit within the system ?",
    "recall that our modes are assumed to be in the tangential direction and we carried out the analysis under a local wkb approximation . for this analysis to be meaningful",
    ", the wavelength of the mode must be substantially smaller than the circumference @xmath115 .",
    "a given cluster model is thus stable if @xmath114 is greater than the largest wavelength for which the wkb analysis is valid , which is probably around @xmath116 .",
    "figure 4 shows the variation of @xmath117 with @xmath63 for the 5 clusters for which we obtained satisfactory models with conduction (  3 ) .",
    "we see that all 5 clusters are thermally stable according to the criterion described above .",
    "one interesting feature is that all the clusters show very similar minimal values of @xmath117 which appear to be fairly close to the threshold of instability .",
    "such a situation would be natural if the clusters , to begin with , had more hot gas than they have now and were thermally unstable .",
    "one expects gas to have cooled and dropped out early in the life of the cluster so that the system naturally reached , and has since maintained , a marginally stable configuration .",
    "a global stability analysis would need to be carried out to check this idea in more detail .",
    "nm01 found that thermal conduction with @xmath118 of order a few tenths can explain the gross energetics of hot gas in galaxy clusters .",
    "they showed that the heat flux transported to the cooler central regions of the cluster from further out is roughly consistent with what is needed to replace the energy lost through radiative cooling . @xcite and",
    "@xcite confirmed this conclusion .    in this paper , we have carried out a further test of the conduction model by investigating the shapes of the density and temperature profiles , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , in an equilibrium cluster .",
    "we solve for these profiles self - consistently , as compared to previous authors , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , who either used the observations directly or employed simple analytical expressions for the shapes of @xmath10 and/or @xmath11 .    among the 10 clusters that we have studied , 5 clusters , namely ,",
    "a1795 , a1835 , a2199 , a2390 and rxj1347.5 - 1145 , can be fitted well with a pure conduction model and with values of @xmath119 ( table 2 , figs . 1 , 2 , 3 ) .",
    "since the model involves no fitting parameters other than @xmath8 , which is used primarily to set the normalization of @xmath120 , and @xmath42 , which is not really a fitting parameter but rather is given one of two values (  3 ) , the good agreement between the model profiles of @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the data is very encouraging .",
    "for these five clusters , the best - fit values of @xmath8 lie within the range expected on theoretical grounds ( nm01 ) .",
    "we believe that these are strong arguments in support of the conduction model .",
    "we should note , however , that the theoretical estimate @xmath70 obtained by nm01 is based on a specific ( plausible ) model of the magnetic field topology , suggested by the work of goldreich & sridhar ( 1995 , 1997 ) , but the answer might change substantially if the field topology ( which is poorly understood in clusters ) is very different .",
    "the other 5 clusters , namely a2052 , a2597 , hydra a , ser 159 - 03 and 3c295 , require larger values of @xmath8 , of order unity or greater , and we consider them to be inconsistent with a pure conduction model .",
    "it is interesting that these five clusters all have active nuclei with strong radio activity , so that nuclear activity might well supply the additional heat required by our models .",
    "it is unclear exactly how an agn would heat the cluster medium .",
    "turbulent mixing of hot gas in a jet with the surrounding cooler gas is a possibility @xcite , though the effect of magnetic fields on this mixing is poorly understood .",
    "heating of the gas by cosmic rays @xcite or hard x - rays @xcite from the agn are other possibilities .    in  4 we showed by means of a local linear stability analysis that the five clusters for which we have obtained good fits with a pure conduction model are all thermally stable .",
    "this is an interesting result because , without conduction , cooling gas in clusters is generally thermally unstable .",
    "we find it reassuring that a single mechanism , namely conduction , is able both to supply the heat lost via radiative cooling and to control the thermal instability in these clusters . in the other five clusters , which require an additional source of energy such as a central agn",
    ", the thermal stability of the gas is not assured .",
    "one way of ensuring stability is to have a heat source with a strong non - linear dependence on density , e.g. , @xmath121 in equation ( [ heating ] ) ; this appears somewhat unnatural . alternatively , conduction , though not an important energy source in these clusters , might still play a role in controlling the instability .    based on the above results",
    ", we suggest that agn heating and conduction both are important in clusters",
    ". in some clusters , agn heating dominates and conduction plays a secondary , though still important , role in helping to stabilize the system .",
    "in other clusters , agn activity is weak , and conduction supplies the energy for cooling as well as prevents the gas from becoming unstable .    while our work suggests that conduction is effective over much of the volume of a cluster , we note that _ chandra _ observations have revealed sharp temperature jumps in some clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ; vikhlinin , markevitch & murray 2001ab ) .",
    "these cold fronts are associated with the interface between the intracluster medium and an infalling galaxy or group .",
    "the observations clearly indicate that conduction is strongly suppressed across the fronts .",
    "@xcite have argued that the magnetic field is stretched out parallel to the cold front by the motion of the infalling galaxy / group and that this explains the very low conductivity . @xcite present interesting evidence for a possible kelvin - helmholtz instability in the cold front in a3667 , confirming that the fronts are probably transient features with lifetimes of only a couple of dynamical times .",
    "the presence of these fronts is thus unlikely to affect the strong conduction that we have hypothesized over the bulk of the cluster .",
    "if cold fronts survive for longer than the cooling time of the gas , then the thermally isolated cool gas would experience runaway cooling . since such runaway cooling",
    "is ruled out by the absence of substantial mass dropout , the lifetimes of cold fronts can not be longer than the cooling time .",

    "<S> we present a simple model of hot gas in galaxy clusters , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and energy balance between radiative cooling and thermal conduction . for five clusters , a1795 , a1835 , a2199 , a2390 and rxj1347.5 - 1145 </S>",
    "<S> , the model gives a good description of the observed radial profiles of electron density and temperature , provided we take the thermal conductivity @xmath0 to be about 30% of the spitzer conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> since the required @xmath0 is consistent with the recent theoretical estimate of narayan & medvedev ( 2001 ) for a turbulent magnetized plasma , we consider a conduction - based equilibrium model to be viable for these clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that the hot gas is thermally stable because of the presence of conduction . for five other clusters , a2052 , a2597 , </S>",
    "<S> hydra a , ser 159 - 03 and 3c295 , the model requires unphysically large values of @xmath0 to fit the data . </S>",
    "<S> these clusters must have some additional source of heat , possibly an active galactic nucleus since all the clusters have strong radio galaxies at their centers . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that thermal conduction , though not dominant in these clusters , may nevertheless play a significant role by preventing the gas from becoming thermally unstable . </S>"
