    "over the last few years some tantalizing , but yet far from conclusive , evidence has been accumulating in support of the idea that some star clusters could harbor a central black hole ( bh ) with a mass of the order of @xmath1 or more .",
    "detection of such an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) has been claimed for @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite , although accurate dynamical models of @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be obtained without a central bh @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the visual appearance of globulars containing an imbh is not that of a so - called core - collapsed cluster , but rather that of a cluster with a still sizable core @xcite .",
    "imbhs present a high theoretical and observational interest as these could be potential ultra - luminous x - ray sources and even emit gravitational waves , detectable by the next generation of gravitational wave detectors , as a result of close interactions with stars .",
    "however , despite this interest and the fact that theoretical studies of bhs in stellar systems started more than 30 years ago ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , detailed direct n - body simulations to study the dynamics of an idealized model with single stars and a central bh have been performed only recently ( @xcite ; see also the studies on the formation of imbhs by runaway mergers of massive stars by @xcite ) .",
    "one ingredient that complicates n - body simulations of globular clusters is the presence of primordial binaries .",
    "often , these are neglected in large simulations despite the increasing observational evidence that many stars in a globular cluster have a companion @xcite .",
    "this frequent neglect is due to the dramatic increase in computational resources required in a simulation where the local dynamical timescale may be many orders of magnitude smaller than the global relaxation timescale ( hard binaries have an orbital period of a few hours , while the half - mass relaxation time can be up to a few billion years ) .",
    "the study of the dynamics in the presence of primordial binaries has been mainly limited to fokker - planck or monte carlo approaches @xcite and to direct simulations with rather modest particle numbers , from @xmath4 @xcite to recent higher resolution simulations , with @xmath5 up to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "some realistic simulations , including primordial binaries are available @xcite , but these are limited only to the first stage of the life of young dense clusters . in the case of open clusters , m67 has been modeled in a 36,000-body simulation running for several gigayears @xcite .",
    "the presence of either an imbh or a significant population of primordial binaries leads to an early release of abundant energy , inhibiting the development of a deep core collapse and hence of the onset of gravothermal oscillations .",
    "an imbh can generate energy by swallowing or tightly binding stars deep in its potential well [ note also that energy can be generated through encounters of stars in the density cusp that is formed around the bh ] , while primordial binaries can generate energy by rapidly increasing binary binding energy through three and four body encounters .",
    "energy thus generated in the core of the system fuels the expansion of the half - mass radius , leading to a self - similar expansion of the entire system @xcite .    in this work we present the first direct simulations of the evolution of globular clusters with both a significant fraction of primordial binaries ( 10  % ) as well as an imbh with a mass of @xmath7 of the total mass of the system .",
    "we address the following questions . under the combined effect of the bh and of the binaries ,",
    "what is the equilibrium size of the cluster core ?",
    "how is the binary population affected by the presence of the central imbh ?",
    "which physical processes dominate in the core ? in principle two",
    "competing effects are possible : the bh may either enhance the disruption rate of binaries both indirectly , due to the creation of a density cusp , and directly , by tidal stripping @xcite , or it may reduce the probability of interactions between binaries and singles , by producing a low stellar density in a relatively large core @xcite .",
    "which process is dominant is of fundamental importance .",
    "these questions are addressed in the next sections .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper have been performed using the nbody-6 code @xcite , that has been modified with the kind help of dr .",
    "aarseth to ensure a more efficient and accurate treatment of the dynamics around the bh ( the relative energy error at the end of our simulations is below @xmath8 ) .",
    "we used a total of @xmath9 equal mass stars ( each of mass @xmath10 ) , arranged in @xmath11 binaries and @xmath12 singles , plus a bh , introduced as a massive star , with mass ( @xmath13 ) in the range @xmath7 of the total mass of the system .",
    "the system is isolated and the initial binding energy distribution for the binaries is in the range @xmath14 to @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the average kinetic energy of a star of the system ) , flat in logarithmic scale as in the runs by @xcite , that we use for comparison , as here we employ the same initial conditions except for the presence of the bh .",
    "the initial mass distribution is that of a plummer model . to initialize the simulation in a situation of approximate dynamical equilibrium in the presence of the bh",
    "we generate a plummer model made of single stars only , we then scale the velocities of the particles to reach virial equilibrium and let the system evolve for @xmath17 half - mass crossing times . some stars",
    "are then selected at random and binaries are added to the simulations , with the standard initialization provided by nbody-6 .",
    "the evolution of the system is then followed up to @xmath18 . for @xmath19",
    "we mean @xmath20 computed at @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the half - mass relaxation time @xcite , defined as @xmath22 , with @xmath23 being the half - mass radius , @xmath24 the total mass of the system and @xmath5 the number of centers of mass ( i.e. @xmath25 in our case ) ; in nbody units @xmath26 for our initial conditions .",
    "the large scale structure evolution of the cluster is dominated by the heating related to the presence of the bh .",
    "in fact only the inner regions of the system experience a mild collapse on a timescale that , depending on the mass of the bh , is of the order of a few @xmath20 . inside the core radius @xmath27 , defined as the density averaged radius @xcite , a cusp in the density profile",
    "is formed within the sphere of influence @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 , see @xcite ) of the bh , with a profile proportional to @xmath30 and thus similar to the @xmath31 measured by @xcite . for @xmath32",
    "the influence radius is approximately @xmath33 . by definition ,",
    "the stellar mass within this radius is comparable to that of the bh , and thus around one percent of the total mass of the cluster .    in case of @xmath32 ,",
    "the core radius @xmath27 is reduced in @xmath34 from the initial value of @xmath35 to @xmath36 ( in nbody units ) .",
    "this is to be compared with a value of @xmath37 reached without the bh ; when a bh ( with the same mass ) but no primordial binaries are present @xmath27 goes down to @xmath38 .    after the first mild contraction all lagrangian radii start to expand steadily and a self - similar regime sets in , with the half - mass radius growing in proportion to @xmath39 , in agreement with the theoretical argument given by @xcite .",
    "the half - mass radius is thus marginally bigger ( by @xmath40 at @xmath41 ) due to the presence of the bh ; without a bh the half - mass expansion starts only after core collapse , which takes @xmath42 in that case .",
    "conversely , if a bh but no binaries are present , the expansion rate of @xmath23 is reduced by @xmath43 .",
    "a summary of the properties of our simulations is reported in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "ccccc @xmath44 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & @xmath48 + 0.014 & 0.1 & 0.75 & 0.29 & 2.46 + 0.025 & 0.1 & 0.80 & 0.31 & 2.83 + 0.014 & 0 & 0.70 & 0.27 & 1.92 + 0 & 0.1 & 0.25 & 0.09 & 2.25 +",
    "as the presence of the bh dominates the global dynamics of the cluster , the evolution of the binaries presents some remarkable differences from the scenario where no central bh is present .",
    "we can distinguish two phases .",
    "the presence of a bh significantly accelerates the rate at which binaries are disrupted in the first few half - mass relaxation times ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the reason is that binaries that pass near the bh can be quickly destroyed .",
    "the disruption rate is approximately constant during the first @xmath49 , while without a bh disruption takes a while to get underway .",
    "the initial disruption rate depends on the mass of the bh : a more massive bh starts burning binaries at a higher rate , as can be seen from fig .  [ fig1 ] .    for our simulation with @xmath50",
    "we observe a binary depletion rate of @xmath51 binaries per initial half - mass crossing time , during the first @xmath49 ( @xmath52 binaries in total ) . around half of the binaries",
    "are disrupted within @xmath28 .",
    "interestingly only two of them happen to be so close to the bh tidal radius @xmath53 that the disruption may be considered a direct consequence of the tidal stripping force exherted by the bh .",
    "here @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the semi - major axis of the binary . with this respect ,",
    "the theoretical model recently proposed by @xcite applied to our simulation would give ( from his eqs .",
    "11 - 12 ) a tidal disruption rate of @xmath56 binaries per initial half - mass crossing time , so that we observe less tidally stripped binaries than expected ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the disruption of binaries by the bh is thus mainly due to an indirect effect : binaries venturing close to the bh , where the density is higher , are more likely to interact with a single star or with another binary .",
    "in fact in our simulations we often observe the presence of hierarchical systems within @xmath28 , with the bh playing the role of a perturber .",
    "after the initial transient phase a self - similar expansion sets in , where the average core density is much less ( approximately by a factor @xmath0 ) than it would be without the presence of a central compact object . in this second phase",
    "we observe ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) a reduced rate of binary disruption ( as this rate is proportional to the square of the density , e.g. see @xcite ) , so that the difference between a simulation with and without a bh becomes remarkable .",
    "the turning point is around @xmath58 , when the number of surviving binaries for a simulation with a central object becomes greater than in the absence of a bh .",
    "our fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] has been given in units of the initial half - mass relaxation time , but the picture remains qualitatively the same even if we consider a co - moving time coordinate to take into account the differences between the half - mass radii of a simulation with and without a bh .",
    "interestingly the spatial distribution of binaries is also different from the case without a bh : as can be seen from fig  [ fig2 ] , the number of binaries within the @xmath59 lagrangian radius is much less for the simulation with a bh .",
    "this is probably due to the disruption of binaries that approach close to the bh . in the presence of a bh",
    ", binaries tend to be more concentrated between the @xmath59 lagrangian radius and the half - mass radius , while in the absence of a bh , binaries can sink deeper into the central region of the cluster . as a result",
    ", the ratio of binaries to singles in the core of the system is between two and three times less than in absence of the bh .",
    "if we compare the evolution of the binding energy distribution of the binaries in a run with and without a central bh , we can see that the net effect of the bh at later times is to somewhat enhance the survival probability of binaries with binding energies of a few @xmath60s ( @xmath61 ) , especially for binaries within the half - mass radius ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this feature is especially apparent in a two - dimensional plot of the distribution of binaries as a function of binding energy and radial distance from the cluster center , depicted in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . the rather strong correlation between radius and binding energy that is observed ( e.g. ,",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in systems without a central compact object is thus almost absent .",
    "in this paper we have presented for the first time the results of direct n - body simulations of the evolution of a globular cluster with a population of primordial binaries that harbors a central imbh , with a mass of the order of @xmath62 of the total mass of the system . in order to begin to analyze the basic evolutionary processes we have restricted our simulations to isolated systems of stars of equal mass , while for the time being neglecting stellar evolution and physical collisions .    the environment around the bh turns out to be of great interest from a dynamical point of view .",
    "it represents a laboratory where complex interactions between hierarchical systems take place . around the bh",
    "we observe usually one or more stars tightly bound to it . with a significant population of primordial binaries",
    ", it frequently happens that a binary approaches the center of the system .",
    "interactions between these subsystems are important not only from a dynamical point of view , but also because they form a factory to produce exotic objects , such as tight ( x - ray emitting ) binaries and high velocities escapers , which we observe in high numbers in our simulations . in our run with @xmath50",
    "we find that a fraction of @xmath63 of the stars of the cluster leave the system in a relaxation time and that @xmath64 of them have escape velocities that exceed by at least five times the core velocity dispersion . of these @xmath65 were binaries ; in addition one triple was ejected from the system .    from a computational point of view",
    "the complex interactions between binaries and the bh have proved to be very challenging for current state of the art n - body algorithms .",
    "clearly , new methods have to be developed to provide both more accuracy and higher efficiency .",
    "we have shown that a bh with a mass of around @xmath62 of the cluster mass can produce most of the energy required to fuel the expansion of the globular cluster , so that the evolution of the large scale structure of a globular cluster with primordial binaries and a central bh is remarkably similar to that attained in the absence of binaries ( see @xcite ) .",
    "even so , the evolution of the population of primordial binaries is strongly influenced by the bh , so that in principle indirect evidence for the presence of the bh can be obtained by observing the distribution of binaries .",
    "observational detection of an unexpectedly large number of only moderately hard binaries in the core could be used as arguments for the presence of a imbh in old star clusters , i.e. in those systems whose age would imply a depletion in the central region of binaries with binding energy below @xmath66 .",
    "these binaries are able to survive in significant numbers when an imbh is present .",
    "clearly , a quantitative comparison with observations would require us to proceed beyond the simple models presented here . to start with",
    ", we would need to include a realistic number of stars to avoid possible biases introduced by the scaling of the ratio of the bh mass to that of single stars .",
    "in addition , the introduction of a realistic initial mass function is likely to modify the concentration of binaries in the center of the system due to mass segregation , and stellar evolution will also influence the distribution of binary binding energy .",
    "however , the main effects presented in this letter are likely to be present , at least in qualitative ways , in more detailed realistic simulations .",
    "we are indebted to sverre aarseth for providing his code nbody-6 with ad - hoc modifications in order to make possible running the simulations presented in this work .",
