    "in a recent publication @xcite , the present authors reported an exhaustive study of the mean - field ( mf ) dynamics of a system of three interacting bose - einstein condensates .",
    "such a system , henceforth referred to as _",
    "trimer _ , deserves attention since it can be considered a paradigm for larger arrays . indeed ,",
    "similar to longer chains and more in general to larger arrays , its mf dynamics is non - integrable and its phase space is characterized by extended regions of instability . on the other hand , the system is still sufficiently small to allow a thorough analytical study , which provides a valuable operational tool in both interpreting experimental observations and identifying significant experimental setups triggering macroscopic effects @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such exhaustive investigation makes the trimer a candidate benchmark for verifying the effectiveness of the mf description , which , being essentially equivalent to the bogolubov approximation , is expected to provide a reliable picture of the dynamics of an array of interacting becs for sufficiently large boson populations .    as to the experimental realization of interacting bec arrays , optical fragmentation allowed to attain 1d @xcite , 2d @xcite and even 3d @xcite lattices consisting of a rather large number of sites .",
    "though bose - einstein condensation has been already achieved both in an optomagnetic @xcite and , more recently , in an entirely magnetic @xcite double - well trap , microtrap technology @xcite is probably the most promising approach for realizing the small systems addressed by the present article , as well as any complex array characterized by a trapping potential lacking the typical periodicity of optical lattices .",
    "we will focus on two small systems , the _ asymmetric dimer _ , i.e. a condensate trapped into an asymmetric double well trap , and the _ open trimer _ of reference @xcite , where an energy offset between the central and the lateral wells of the trapping potential is present ( a multiwell trapping potential characterized by uneven well depths may possibly be achieved within a supercell of a suitable optical superlattice @xcite ) . our aim is to compare the spectrum of the quantum hamiltonians describing these systems with the characteristic energies of the relevant mean - field picture , in the spirit of reference @xcite .",
    "there aubry and co - workers illustrated a remarkable relation between the energy of the mean - field saddle point ( separatrix ) of the symmetric dimer and some features of the spectrum of the quantum counterpart of the same system .    in the following",
    "we will extend these results to the more general case of the asymmetric dimer .",
    "subsequently , exploiting the exact mapping between the mean - field picture of the dimer and that of the integrable sub regime of the trimer , which we show to apply at a qualitative level in the purely quantum treatment of the systems , we will point out some more interesting manifestations of mf features in the spectrum of the trimer .    before proceeding with our analysis , we briefly recall some generalities .",
    "the essential physics of an array of coupled becs is captured by the bose - hubbard model @xcite , describing a gas of interacting bosons hopping across the sites of an ambient lattice .",
    "the relevant hamiltonian reads @xmath0 $ ] , where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator on site @xmath3 , @xmath4 counts the number of bosons at the same on site , @xmath5 is the on - site interaction parameter , @xmath6 is a the energy offset of site @xmath3 , @xmath7 is the hopping parameter and the subscript @xmath8 restricts the sum to the nearest neighbours of site @xmath3",
    ".    a mean - field treatment of the bose - hubbard model can be achieved by means of a time dependent variational principle based on glauber s coherent states @xcite . according to such picture each site in the array",
    "is described by a macroscopic complex variable @xmath9 whose square modulus @xmath10 and argument @xmath11 represent the population and phase associated to the condensate sitting at that site , respectively . barring constant terms ,",
    "the effective mf hamiltonian has the form @xmath12 $ ] and , equipped with the poisson brackets among the ( canonical ) macroscopic variables , @xmath13 determines the dynamics of the system .. the essential features of the dynamics are determined by the phase space structure , which can be analyzed working out the location and the stability character of the corresponding fixed points .",
    "notice that since @xmath14 features only two - boson operators , it commutes with the the total number operator @xmath15 .",
    "likewise , the total population @xmath16 is a constant of the motion mirroring the global phase invariance of @xmath17 .",
    "hence the fixed point equations have the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a lagrange multiplier constraining the total number of bosons .",
    "though the solutions of the fixed point equations are in principle complex vectors , they can be safely restricted to real values , with the only exception of the topological solutions @xcite which are to be found in cyclically invariant structures ( i.e. homogeneous closed chains and their higher dimensional generalizations ) . since the structures we will consider are neither cyclic nor homogeneous , in solving the fixed point equations we will set @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the bose - hubbard hamiltonian for an asymmetric dimer has the form @xmath23 where the subscripts @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the left and the right sites of the structure , respectively , and @xmath26 is a local energy offset deriving from the asymmetry of the double - well trap confining the bec . as we briefly recalled above",
    ", the mf counterpart of hamiltonian is @xmath27 , and determines the evolution of the macroscopic semiclassical variables through the ( integrable ) equations of motion @xmath28 according to the discussion in the previous section , and after introducing the conveniently rescaled parameters @xmath29 where @xmath30 , the consequent fixed point equations read @xmath31 notice that @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the only significant parameters , whereas @xmath34 has an auxiliary function and its value is different for different fixed points . in the following",
    "we will consider @xmath35 s up to the order of @xmath36 , corresponding to relative energy offsets of the order of @xmath37 .",
    "if large total populations are involved , the limit situation may correspond to an overly asymmetric double well potential .",
    "notice however that comparable relative energies are easily attained in the mf integrable subregime of the trimer , which can be described in terms of an asymmetric dimer , as we will discuss in the next section .    depending on whether @xmath35 is smaller or larger than @xmath38 , have either four or two solutions . in the former case",
    "there are two maxima , a saddle point and a minimum .",
    "as @xmath35 grows , the local maximum and the saddle get closer and closer , until they collapse and disappear when @xmath35 crosses the ( @xmath32-dependent ) critical value . , and occurs at a @xmath35-dependent critical value @xcite .",
    "a similar coupling - driven change in the semiclassical phase space of a 2d bec array has been recently proposed as a mechanism to trigger an abrupt delocalization in the system @xcite .",
    "] we mention that the presence of two maxima is an aspect of the mirror - symmetry breaking induced by nonlinearity , leading to interesting phenomena such as self - trapping and @xmath39-phase oscillations , that are investigated in reference @xcite for the symmetric dimer .",
    "aubry and co - workers @xcite focused on the symmetric dimer ( @xmath40 ) , and found that when the mf saddle point ( separatrix ) is present , i.e. for @xmath41 , its energy is strictly related to some interesting features of the spectrum of @xmath42 .",
    "they noticed that the density of states of @xmath42 features a sharp peak centered around the saddle point energy .",
    "furthermore this mf energy marks the boundary between two regions of the spectrum characterized by significantly different magnitudes of the splitting energy of the doublets arising from the mirror symmetry of the symmetric dimer .",
    "more precisely the energy splitting experiences a drop of several orders of magnitude as the average energy of the doublet becomes larger than the threshold value marked by the saddle point energy .",
    "further analytical considerations about the splitting pattern of the quantum dimer doublets and its relation with the saddle point energy of the corresponding mean - field model can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "notice that the magnitude of the splitting between even - odd doublets of the symmetric dimer is also related to the characteristic time - scale for the symmetry - restoring quantum tunneling between semiclassically self - trapped states @xcite .",
    "here we show that the results by aubry and co - workers can be extended and generalized to the asymmetric dimer , where @xmath26 ( and of course @xmath33 ) has a finite value . to this end",
    "it proves useful to plot the energies of the mf fixed points of @xmath43 versus the energy offset among the two sites of the dimer , @xmath26 , which gives a measure of its asymmetry .",
    "this can be accomplished recasting the dynamics of the trimer in terms of the alternative set of canonical variables ( see e.g. reference @xcite for further details about this alternative canonical representation ) .",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , whose significant poisson brackets are @xmath48 .",
    "this way , the relevant dynamic equations can be used to give a parametric representation allowing to plot the fixed point energies versus @xmath26 for a given value of the hopping amplitude .",
    "since it is interesting to compare situations characterized by different total populations , we provide this parametric representation in terms of the rescaled parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the energy in units of @xmath51 , @xmath52 $ ] is the rescaled population imbalance @xcite , and @xmath53 is either zero or @xmath54 .",
    "the former choice pertains to the minimum fixed point no matter for the value of the hopping amplitude . as we discussed above ,",
    "when @xmath55 there is only one more point , a maximum , independent of the value of the energy offset @xmath35 . in this case the remaining choice for the angular variable , @xmath56 , describes the energy of the maximum on the entire domain , @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "if , conversely , @xmath58 , the choice @xmath56 pertains to different fixed points depending on the domain of evaluation .",
    "more in detail , the energy of the saddle , local maximum and absolute maximum are obtained evaluating with @xmath59 belonging to the interval @xmath60 $ ] , @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 $ ] , respectively , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     notice that any definite - parity quantum state yields @xmath65 , which is a possible quantum counterpart of the mf integrability condition @xmath66 , where @xmath67 makes probably a better candidate . due to limited space",
    ", we refer to @xcite for a discussion about this issue . ] .",
    "this is basically the reason why each dimeric level in the right panel of figure [ f : qmap ] overlaps with an odd - even doublet of the trimer : the latter is the minimal set of eigenstates producing a state lacking a definite parity , which is the quantum counterpart of a mf asymmetric configuration .",
    "recall indeed that the dimer under concern is the quantum counterpart of that qualitatively describing the asymmetric fixed points of the trimer .",
    "conversely , though intrinsically asymmetric , the dimer considered in the left panel of figure [ f : qmap ] pertains to the symmetric configurations of the trimer and hence there is no surprise that in some instances a dimeric level corresponds to a solitary level of the trimer rather than to an even - odd doublet . if proved to occur in general , the fact that such solitary levels are always even , as in figure [ f : qmap ] , remains to be understood .",
    "notice that the ( even ) absolute maximum of the trimer for @xmath68 seems to have a dimeric counterpart both in the left and in the right panel of figure [ f : qmap ] .",
    "actually , as it becomes evident considering a larger value of @xmath69 , the overlap in the right panel is accidental , and hence it is not an exception to our discussion above .",
    "this means that , as we mentioned in section [ s : mfmap ] , one of the dimeric levels in the right panel ( the absolute maximum for @xmath68 ) has no correspondent among the levels of the trimer .",
    "owing to the quantum persistence of the dimer - trimer correspondence , most of the results about the asymmetric trimer presented in section [ s : dim ] can be extended in a straightforward manner to the case of the trimer .",
    "as we mentioned at the beginning of the present section , figure [ f : qmap ] provides a quite useful key for interpreting the otherwise quite obscure trimeric version of figure [ f : dim ] . actually , owing to the quantum persistence of the dimer - trimer correspondence , most of the results about the asymmetric trimer presented in section [ s : dim ]",
    "are so straightforwardly extended to the case of the trimer , that there is no need of including such figure in the present work .",
    "we focused on the bose - hubbard hamiltonians describing two small arrays of interacting becs , the asymmetric dimer and the trimer . in section [ s : dim ]",
    "we related some interesting features of the energy spectrum of the former hamiltonian , whose asymmetry ensues from an imbalance between the on - site energy terms , to the energies of the fixed point of the corresponding mean - field effective hamiltonian .",
    "these results are inspired by and generalize those concerning the symmetric dimer reported in reference @xcite .",
    "section [ s : trm ] is devoted to a similar investigation on the spectrum of the trimer . in order to find our bearings in the rather complex level pattern , in section [ s : mfmap ] we exploited an interesting mapping among the mean - field dynamics of the trimer and that of the asymmetric dimer discussed in the previous section .",
    "in particular we showed that such mapping , which is exact only for the integrable sub regime of the trimer , applies approximately also to the energies of most of its fixed points . based on these mean - field results , in section [ s : qmap ]",
    "we observed that a similar approximate mapping exists also at the quantum level .",
    "we emphasize that the ( quasi ) dimeric character of the spectrum of the trimer is by no means evident from the structure of the relevant bose - hubbard hamiltonian , and it strongly relies on the observations reported in section [ s : mfmap ] .",
    "the results gathered in sections [ s : mfmap ] and [ s : qmap ] , along with the underlying systematic study of references @xcite and @xcite , allow to extend straightforwardly the observations reported in section [ s : dim ] to the case of the trimer .",
    "the results presented in this work form the basis for a systematic study of the purely quantum trimer . among the issues worth developing we mention a possible characterization of the quantum counterpart of chaos .",
    "recall indeed that , owing to the non - integrability of the mean - field dynamics , the trajectories based in the vicinity of unstable fixed points are likely to display strong instabilities .",
    "hence the mapping between fixed points and energy spectrum may provide a guide in recognizing possible quantum manifestations of chaos .",
    "furthermore , if the system under concern is about to be realized experimentally , as promised by the recent advances in trapping techniques , the systematic study here proposed could provide a benchmark for verifying the effectiveness of the model hamiltonians used to describe its physics . in this respect",
    "we recall that small bosonic lattices have been proposed for the implementation of quantum computation @xcite ."
