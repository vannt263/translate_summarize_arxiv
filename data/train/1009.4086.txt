    "the term `` magnetosphere '' was coined to describe `` the region in the vicinity of the earth in which the earth s magnetic field dominates all dynamical processes '' ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gold 1959 ) ) . the earth s magnetic field",
    "is distorted by the solar wind , compressed on the side closest to the sun and pulled out on the opposite side into the magnetotail . as observations",
    "improved , it was shown that each planet with a magnetic field also possessed a similar magnetosphere to the earth s , all created by the solar wind s effect on the magnetic field .",
    "eventually , `` magnetosphere '' was expanded to include stellar environments where winds and magnetic fields interact , e.g. the solar win and magnetic field .",
    "unlike planetary magnetospheres , stellar magnetospheres expand outward , as the wind is coming directly from the star itself .",
    "we can understand solar system magnetospheres in great detail , describing the complex plasma physics , as we are able to obtain direct observations by satellites . in the stellar case , we must use remote observations to infer physical properties ( i.e. , temperature , density ) , augmented by magnetohydrodynmaical ( mhd ) simulations .",
    "there is a distinctive difference between solar and massive - star magnetospheres . in lower mass stars like the sun",
    ", an @xmath1-@xmath2 dynamo combines a convective envelope with differential rotation to produce complex , small - scale , time variable field structures .",
    "globally , the field is quite weak .",
    "the solar wind is pressure - driven with a relatively weak mass loss rate ( @xmath3 10@xmath4 m@xmath5/yr ) .",
    "more massive stars have mostly radiative envelopes .",
    "this major difference makes magnetic field generation by a dynamo difficult to explain , so the question of the origin of magnetic fields in massive stars remains open .",
    "massive - star fields are also quite different from their solar counterparts .",
    "their fields are generally steady , large scale , and sometimes very strong .",
    "massive - star winds are radiatively driven with strong mass loss rates ( on average @xmath3 10@xmath6 m@xmath5/yr ) .",
    "hereafter , this paper will focus solely on massive - star magnetospheres , specifically in the strong magnetic field case .",
    "as the wind interacts with the magnetic field , material from the stellar wind can be perturbed , channeled , torqued , and even confined .",
    "massive star magnetospheres are generally structured and dynamic .",
    "material is released in reconnection events , falls back onto the star and creates collisional shocks .",
    "rotation complicates the physical picture , but it also allows for regular modulation of observables , through which the physical properties of these magnetospheres can be identified .",
    "the magnetospheric properties depend on the relative strengths of the wind and magnetic energy densities of the star .",
    "* ud - doula & owocki ( 2002 ) ) define a wind confinement parameter to quantify this struggle between the wind strength and magnetic strength , @xmath7 for @xmath8 , the wind overwhelms the field , but for @xmath9 , the magnetic field is dominant near the star , channeling wind material into a magnetosphere .",
    "the alfvn radius , r@xmath10 , is where the magnetic and wind energy densities become equal . for a strong magnetic confinement ( @xmath11 ) and a dipole field configuration , r@xmath12 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ud - doula & owocki 2002 ) ) .",
    "* ud - doula et al . ( 2008 ) ) also define a kepler co - rotation radius ( r@xmath13 = ( v@xmath14/v@xmath15)@xmath16 r@xmath17 ) .",
    "if the alfvn radius is father out than the kepler radius a region of confinement is created .",
    "wind material is spun up by the magnetic field and supported by centrifugal forces . above r@xmath10 ,",
    "the field is too weak to confine material ; below r@xmath13 , it is no longer supported by centrifugal forces and so falls back on the star .",
    "in many magnetic bp stars , the magnetic field is strong , rotation is fast , and @xmath11 .",
    "the field spins up and confines the channeled wind keeping it rigidly rotating well beyond the kepler co - rotation radius , but also held down against the net outward centrifugal force relative to gravity . for this strong field limit , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* townsend & owocki ( 2005 ) ) developed an analytical model , the rigidly rotating magnetosphere ( rrm ) model , wherein wind plasma settles at the local minima of the effective ( gravitational + centrifugal ) potential .",

    "it only accounts for the circumstellar effects that create the observed double eclipse pattern , but the stellar photosphere also contributes to the brightness variations .",
    "this leads to discrepancies ( figure [ fig1 ] ) between the observed and simulated photometric light curve , which we are currently investigating .",
    "we obtained a total of 18 high resolution ( r=65000 ) broadband ( 370 - 1040  nm ) circular polarization spectra of @xmath0 ori e. sixteen of these spectra were obtained in november 2007 from the narval spectropolarimeter attached to the 2.2 m bernard lyot telescope at the pic du midi observatory in france .",
