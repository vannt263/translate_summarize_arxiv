    "@xcite @xcite that is related to the concepts of recurrence and coupling in markov chains have been utilized in many applications especially in queuing theory .",
    "such problems arise in many applications in feedback quantization and source coding , networks , and stochastic control . as an example , consider the following scheme which includes the @xmath25-modulation @xcite algorithm commonly used in source coding as a special case : let @xmath26 be stationary and ergodic , @xmath27 be a quantizer , and consider the following update : @xmath28 where @xmath29 . here , @xmath7 is the output of an adaptive encoder and @xmath1 is the source to be encoded .",
    "in addition to further adaptive coding schemes , applications include stabilization of controlled systems driven by noise processes with memory , design of networked control systems over channels with memory , as well as network and queuing systems .",
    "such stability problems have been investigated for a number of setups ; for an incomplete list see @xcite .",
    "notably , the contributions in kieffer @xcite @xcite @xcite are the most relevant ones to the discussion in this paper . these have studied problems motivated from applications in source coding and quantization as in ( [ deltamod ] ) .",
    "@xcite considered a non - markovian setup where @xmath8 is countable , @xcite considered a setup where @xmath8 is not countable , but @xmath30 is continuous on @xmath31 for every @xmath32 .",
    "our approach and the proof technique is different than that considered in the literature ; notably from that of kieffer @xcite , and kieffer and dunham @xcite ( as well as other contributions such as @xcite @xcite @xcite and @xcite which can be approached by finite dimensional markov chain formulations ) .",

    "the approach of viewing @xmath33},s_k)$ ] as a markov chain , to our knowledge , first has been studied by hairer @xcite , where the focus of the author has been on the uniqueness of an invariant measure on the state process @xmath7 , under the assumption that an invariant measure exists and further regularity assumptions . in this paper , we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of an invariant probability measure for the joint process while deriving our results .",
    "we also establish connections with asymptotic mean stationarity , in addition to the existence of an invariant measure , and ergodicity .",
    "we will see that conditions of the form : @xmath35 play an important role for the stochastic stability results in this paper . even though in the applications we consider we will explicitly study sufficient conditions for such a result , for a class of non - markovian sources useful sufficient conditions ( inspired from applications in queuing and networks ) are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these follow from lyapunov - drift type conditions such as , with @xmath36 for all @xmath37 : @xmath38 < -a_1 $ ] , for some @xmath39 , and a uniform bound on jumps from below @xmath40 as @xmath41 < a_2 $ ] for @xmath42 , @xmath43 leading to finite bounds on @xmath44 $ ] for arbitrarily small @xmath45 , which through an application of markov s inequality lead to ( [ tights0 ] ) .",
    "thus , the findings in @xcite and @xcite together with the results in this paper can be used to obtain _ foster - lyapunov _ type drift criteria for various forms of stochastic stability .",
    "a further related view to approach such problems is the traditional random dynamical systems view in which one studies the properties of the shifted sequences @xmath46 : such a viewpoint leads to the interpretation that the entire uncertainty is realized in the initial state of the markov chain , and the process evolves deterministically through a shift map .",
    "this approach has led to important contributions on ergodic theory and the introduction of useful notions such as asymptotic mean stationarity @xcite .",
    "connections between the two approaches and the implications on the convergences of ( [ convergence2])-([convergence4 ] ) will be made in the paper .    in section [ sequencemarkovi ] , we discuss the conditions for the existence of an invariant probability measure . in section [ ergodicitystat ] , we discuss the conditions for asymptotic mean stationarity and ergodicity .",
