    "stecker & scully ( 2006 ) ( ss06 ) derived a simple analytic expression for the change in spectral index of a tev @xmath0-ray   source in the redshift range between 0.05 and 0.4 .",
    "they showed that the change in the spectral index caused by intergalactic absorption is given by an approximately linear relation in redshift , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath1 .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to generalze this relation by including the effect of intrinsic steepening in the source spectra between the mutli - gev energy range observed by _",
    "fermi _ and the tev range observed by atmospheric herenkov telescopes .",
    "our general result is roughly independent of the specific model of the intergalactic background light ( ibl ) used , because it only depends on the shape of the average galaxy spectral energy distribution ( sed ) on the near ir side of the starlight peak that determines the absorption in the tev energy range .",
    "we compare our relation for the specific baseline and fast evolution models of stecker , malkan & scully ( 2006 ) ( sms06 ) with the results of recent _ fermi _ observations of 13 tev selected bl lac agn .",
    "we also show how it can be used to independently determine the redshift evolution of the ibl .",
    "in order to determine the effect of intergalactic absorption , we use the results of ss06 demonstrating that @xmath2 can be fitted to an approximately logarithmic function in @xmath3 in the energy range @xmath4 and one which is linear on @xmath5 over the range @xmath6 .",
    "it is important to note that our linear fit to the @xmath5 dependence is both _",
    "qualitatively _ and _ quantitatively _ different from the linear dependence on redshift which would be obtained for small redshifts @xmath7 and which simply comes from the fact that for small @xmath5 where luminosity evolution is unimportant and where @xmath8 , with the distance @xmath9 .",
    "our quantitative fit for the higher redshift range @xmath10 comes from the more complex calculations based on the models of sms . for this reason ,",
    "the linear fits in ss06 are not simply proportional to redshift .",
    "ss06 found that @xmath11 is well approximated by    @xmath12,\\ ] ]    where @xmath13and @xmath14 are constants .",
    "this expression holds over the energy and redshift ranges given above .",
    "the energy range of validity is the energy range to which the atmospheric erenkov telescopes are sensitive .",
    "following ss06 , we assume an intrinsic source spectrum that can be approximated by a power law of the form @xmath15 over a limited energy range .",
    "then the spectrum that will be observed at the earth following intergalactic absorption will be of the power - law form    @xmath16    this can be compared with the empirically observed tev spectra that are usually presented in the literature to be good fits to power - laws .",
    "the observed spectral index , @xmath17 , will then be given by    @xmath18    where the intrinsic spectral index of the source is steepened by intergalactic absorption by an amount @xmath19 .",
    "on the other hand , in the multi - gev range over which the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) is sensitive , we expect essentially no steepening from absorption over the redshift range of validity , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath20 .    the parameters @xmath21 , and @xmath14 obtained by fitting the optical depths derived for the fast evolution ( fe ) and baseline ( b ) models of sms06 are given in table 1 .",
    "the importance of synchrotron self compton emission in producing high energy @xmath0-raysin astrophysical sources was pointed out by rees ( 1967 ) .",
    "particular applications to the crab and other sources were discussed by gould ( 1965 ) and rieke & weekes ( 1969 ) . today , given present observational studies of tev - selected bl lac agn , it is generally accepted that the synchrotron self compton mechanism is the primary emission mechanism for producing @xmath0-raysin the tev energy range in tev - selected bl lac agn .",
    "the @xmath0-ray   spectrum from compton interactions is a smoothy varying one ( blumenthal & gould 1970 ) .",
    "good empirical fits the the seds of the low energy peaks in blazars were obtained by using parabolic functions on log - log plots ( landau , et al .",
    "1986 , sambruna , maraschi & urry 1996 ) .",
    "in fact , these considerations led to the prediction of candidate bl lac objects to be found by atmospheric erenkov telescopes in the tev energy range ( stecker , de jager & salamon 1996 ; costamante & ghisellini 2002 ) .",
    "we assume such an approximation here , _",
    "i.e. _ ,    @xmath22    where @xmath23 with the simplification that @xmath24 is in dimensionless fiducial units ( _ i.e._,@xmath25 ) , and    @xmath26    here , @xmath27 is a constant parameter based on the ensemble averaged width of the parabola in @xmath28 space based on a set of seds of tev selected bl lacs and @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the energy at which the compton peak of the average bl lac sed is a maximum .",
    "we note that for some bl lacs electron scattering in the klein - nishina regime will distort our parabolic assumption on the high energy end of their seds , possibly reducing @xmath31 by a small amount ( tavecchio , maraschi & ghisellini 1998 ) .",
    "however , this does not significantly affect our formalism .",
    "we find that the change in the slope of the intrinsic source spectrum occurring between some average observed energy in the gev range @xmath32 and some average observed energy in the tev range @xmath33 is approximately given by a constant ,    @xmath34    thus , the ensemble averaged intrinsic bl lac source spectrum in going from the gev range to the tev range is independent of redshift within the errors in the observational data .",
    "we will therefore approximate the average intrinsic steepening over an observed set of tev selected blazars by    @xmath35",
    "the total steepening expected betwen the gev and tev energy ranges is then given by the relation    @xmath36    the parameters @xmath21 , and @xmath14 obtained by fitting the optical depths derived for the fast evolution ( fe ) and baseline ( b ) models of sms06 are given in table 1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is then derived by performing a @xmath38 fit to the observed steepening data obtained by the _ fermi _ collaboration ( abdo , et al .",
    "2009 ) in order to find @xmath39 .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is also given in table 1 for the fe and b models .",
    "the data on the tev selected bl lacs from abdo , et al .",
    "( 2009 ) are shown in figures 1 and 2 , along with the best - fit linear relations for the models indicated .",
    "it can be seen that , given the present limited data set and large error bars , one can not uniquely determine the parameters @xmath40 , @xmath14 and @xmath37 .",
    "however , in principle , with a good enough data set , one could determine @xmath37 uniquely from equation ( [ k ] ) .",
    "then , since @xmath41 , one could use equation ( [ total ] ) to determine the parameter @xmath14 .",
    "this will then give a determination of the redshift evolution of the ibl independently of models of the star formation rate .",
    "cccc fast evolution & -0.0972 & 10.6 & 0.427 + baseline & -0.0675 & 7.99 & 0.716 +    figures [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] show the fits of the parameters given in table 1 to the linear dependence in and redshift given by equation ( [ total ] ) .",
    "we have derived a simple analytic approximation for determining the steepening in the spectra of tev selected bl lac agn and compared our results with recent observational data on 13 tev selected bl lac agn .",
    "our relation is in excellent agreement with the observational data and provides a framework for understanding and interpreting both these and observational data .",
    "ss06 have shown that the effect of intergalactic absorption on the spectra of agn in the energy range 0.2 tev @xmath42 2 tev and the redshift range @xmath10 is a simple power - law to power - law steepening .",
    "absorption in this energy range is primarily produced by interactions with near infrared photons from on the low energy sides of the starlight peaks in galaxy seds .",
    "the _ shape _ of the resulting peak in the intergalactic sed produces an approximately logarithmic energy dependence for the function @xmath43 .",
    "this energy dependence should be roughly the same for all models of the ibl .",
    "therefore , our general result of a linear @xmath44 relationship is roughly independent of the specific ibl model used because it only depends on the shape of the average galaxy sed on the near ir side of the ibl starlight peak . the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath37 will be different for the different models since the absolute value of @xmath46 varies from one ibl model to another .",
    "given our derived relation between @xmath47 and redshift , and with good enough data on the mean @xmath0-ray   sed of tev selected bl lacs used to determine @xmath37 , the redshift evolution of the ibl can , in principle , be determined independently of stellar evolution models .",
    "we thank stephen fegan and david sanchez for sending the bl lac data table used in our figures 1 and 2 .",
    "we thank markos georganopoulos for a helpful discussion ."
