    "a major effort in condensed - matter theory goes towards the development of new techniques for the study of correlated - electron systems , such as the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) . when studying the hubbard model , dmft",
    "is often implemented with a simple analytic form of the self - consistency condition that corresponds to using a gaussian , semi - circular or lorentzian non - interacting density of states @xcite .",
    "this has led to analytic work investigating , for example the mott transition @xcite .",
    "results from dynamical mean - field theory are expected to be applicable to 3d systems , but since dmft only considers local processes , physics in low dimensions can not accurately be investigated .",
    "there have been several approaches that extend the core ideas of dmft so that low - dimensional systems can be studied , including the dynamical - cluster approximation ( dca ) which systematically reintroduces spatial fluctuations into the dynamical mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "dca is an extremely powerful method which has been applied to a wide range of model systems @xcite , but it can be computationally expensive , and intensive numerical simulation may lack intuition . carrying out analytic work with the dynamical - cluster approximation is difficult owing to the coarse - graining step which completes the self - consistency , which consists of a partial sum over momenta in small regions of the brillouin zone .",
    "the partial sum can not be carried out analytically .     and",
    "a vector @xmath0 is defined which relates the center of a sub - zone to a location in that sub - zone.,width=264 ]    by neglecting momentum conservation at the interaction vertices , dmft replaces the self - energy , @xmath1 , by its momentum - independent counterpart . in 2d ,",
    "the spatial fluctuations which were neglected in the dmft are expected to contribute significantly .",
    "dca includes these fluctuations by dividing up the brillouin zone into sub - zones which obey the lattice symmetry @xcite or more recently using bett s clusters @xcite .",
    "this coarse graining step corresponds to a mapping onto a cluster - impurity model . within each of these sub - zones ,",
    "the self - energy is assumed to be momentum independent , so the coarse graining of the green function can be written @xmath2 here @xmath0 is a vector that lies within the sub - zone as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] .",
    "the sum over momenta is normally carried out numerically .",
    "since the self - energy is momentum independent within each sub - zone , it is possible to replace the sum over momenta with a partial density of states , leading to the relation @xcite , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the non - interacting fermion partial density of states ( dos ) for the sub - zone centered about @xmath5 ( see figure [ figure : comparedos](a ) ) .    in both dmft and dca ,",
    "the self - energy and the coarse - grained green function are also related through a modified dyson equation , @xmath6 the self - consistency is closed by calculating the self - energy from @xmath7 , which may be interpreted as the host green function of an impurity model @xcite .",
    "cluster impurity problems have been extensively studied , therefore a number of different approximations for the self - energy are readily available .    here , i suggest a simple analytical form for the dynamical - cluster self - consistency step , eqn .",
    "[ eqn : dcagreensfunction ] .",
    "i use results from the hubbard model @xcite to establish if the simplified forms lead to acceptable results .",
    "the hubbard model is one of the simplest non - trivial models of electronic correlations in the solid state , and examines a single band of electrons , hopping between lattice sites with amplitude @xmath8 , and interacting via a coulomb repulsion , @xmath9 , represented by a hamiltonian , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 creates an electron on site @xmath12 with spin @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the number operator ) .",
    "this model can only be solved exactly in one dimension @xcite , but has been extensively examined in the infinite - dimensional limit corresponding to dmft @xcite , and in a wide range of other approximations , including dca @xcite .",
    "this paper is set out as follows : in section [ section : dca ] , i suggest and summarize several approximate forms for the self - consistency step of the dca equations .",
    "i test the accuracy of the new schemes in section [ section : results ] .",

    "values of the hubbard @xmath9 approaching the band - width will be considered . in this paper , numerics are used to demonstrate the validity of the scheme .",
    "however , the intention is that researchers will be able to use approximate forms of the self - consistent condition to generate analytic solutions of model systems in conjunction with appropriate forms of the self energy .    in order to test the accuracy of a scheme which uses approximate partial densities of states ,",
    "the fluctuation - exchange ( flex ) approximation is used to compute the self energy of the cluster .",
    "details of the flex approach and its use as a cluster solver may be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "flex has a transparent physical interpretation , since it approximates the self - energy by three subsets of diagrams , which represent spin - flips , density fluctuations and pair fluctuations .",
    "computations were carried out at finite temperature using the matsubara formalism .",
    "all calculations were initialized with zero self - energy , and then the green function was calculated self - consistently until a convergence of 1 part in @xmath27 was reached . at this stage",
    ", observables were calculated .",
    "ideally a full quantum monte - carlo scheme would be used to solve the cluster impurity problem , since flex can overestimate the self - energy and could potentially be insensitive to the different forms of the course graining schemes ( for example the absence of van hove singularities ) .",
    "however for moderate couplings flex is accurate , and it is expected that approximate schemes for the self - consistency are most likely to fail when electrons are not localized ( since strongly localized electrons can be well described with a single site impurity ) .    the total energy and local moment are plotted in figure [ figure : varu ] as coupling , @xmath9 , is varied .",
    "the cluster size is @xmath28 , temperature @xmath21 and electron density @xmath22 .",
    "results computed using a number of different approximations to the partial dos are shown .",
    "the gaussian approximation to the partial dos leads to the most accurate results .",
    "in fact , the difference between the curves computed using the gaussian and exact non - interacting dos is not easily distinguished by eye .",
    "agreement is also found when the semi - circular partial dos is used to approximate the self - consistency , with an accuracy of a few percent . using the semi - circular dos to approximate",
    "the self consistency is more favorable to analytic approximations , since the self - consistent equations also have a square root form and can easily be inverted . at large @xmath9 , the curves corresponding to the gaussian dos , semi - circular dos and the dca scheme all converge .",
    "this is expected , since at large @xmath9 at half - filling hopping is suppressed , the system becomes local and the precise form of the non - interacting dos ( which is related to the details of the intersite hopping and the specific lattice ) becomes irrelevant .",
    "the matching of both moments is very important to achieve accurate results .",
    "when only the first moment is matched , for example using the modified finite size approximation , the errors on the moment and total energy are significant .",
    "there is a large overestimation of the local moment , and a huge underestimation of the total energy . approximating",
    "the exact non - interacting density of states with a lorentzian generates the worst approximation .",
    "presumably this is because the second moment is ill defined , and the kinetic energy in the absence of interaction is grossly overestimated .",
    "however , some of the qualitative features remain and it might be possible to extract some useful physics even with such a crude approximation @xcite .",
    "the previous results were calculated for a half filled lattice , corresponding to one of the interesting limits of the hubbard model . to determine the performance of the approximation away from half - filling , figure [ figure : varmu ] shows the variation of the filling as the chemical potential , @xmath29 , is changed .",
    "the temperature is @xmath21 and the coupling @xmath24 .",
    "calculations are shown for the full dca self consistency scheme , and also for the gaussian and semi - circular approximations to the self - consistency .",
    "the change of @xmath30 gives a rough measure of the variation in the renormalized dos at the fermi energy for a particular value of the chemical potential , and thus an indication of the performance of the scheme away from half filling .",
    "for @xmath31 , it might be expected that the analytic schemes have larger errors , since the approximate forms of the non - interacting dos do not have the correct form when the density of electrons is low ( for example the gaussian dos has unphysical high energy tails ) . in fact , the agreement is good for filling less than @xmath25 , where a kink develops . for larger fillings , there are only small discrepancies of the order of a fraction of a percent .    since it is possible that cancellations of errors could lead to good agreement of thermodynamic quantities , but may not give good results when correlation functions are computed , fig .",
    "[ fig : realim ] shows the real and imaginary components of the green function on the matsubara axis .",
    "only tiny differences can be seen between the forms of the green functions computed using the gaussian approximated scheme and the dca .",
    "here @xmath32 , @xmath26 and @xmath21 and the system is half filled . to clarify the quality of the approximation , the difference between the values of the green functions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmprealim ] . for the parameters used here ,",
    "the difference is around 1% for the smallest matsubara frequencies , and the two schemes converge for larger values of @xmath33 . in the weak to intermediate @xmath9 regime ,",
    "any discrepancies between quantities computed using the approximate and exact forms of the self - consistency condition are expected to be most pronounced , and intermediate @xmath9 is of most physical interest , so it is promising that the approximate scheme works well for @xmath32 .",
    "finally , to demonstrate that the form of the interacting density of states @xmath34/\\pi$ ] can be computed to reasonable accuracy using the alternative self consistency scheme , pad approximants are used to analytically continue the green function to the real axis @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmppade ] .",
    "while the detailed structure of the interacting dos varies slightly , the main features are similar .",
    "this is in spite of the significant difference between the exact and approximate forms of the non - interacting density of states at the fermi - surface ( for example , a factor of almost 2 difference can be seen at the fermi surface in fig .",
    "[ figure : comparedos ] ) .",
    "in particular , a similar amount of spectral weight is shifted across the fermi surface in both cases .",
    "the density of states at the fermi - surface associated with the course grained zone centered about the @xmath35 point is of similar size for both approximations , and the band widening is similar .",
    "in principle , the analytic schemes presented here could be used for calculating two particle properties , such as the superconducting , charge density wave and spin density wave susceptibilities . to examine the potential for the computation of two particle properties , i use the particle - hole susceptibility as an example . following ref .",
    ", the coarse - grained non - interacting susceptibility can be computed using the following expression , @xmath36 where @xmath0 is a vector that lies within a sub - brillouin zone .",
    "it is possible to simplify this expression for use with the approximate scheme discussed in this article in two special cases ; when @xmath37 and when @xmath38 .",
    "first , if @xmath39 then the propagator becomes , @xmath40 since in the dynamical cluster approximation @xmath41 is constant within each sub - zone , this simplifies to , @xmath42 so that the form of the partial density of states consistent with the approximation to the self - consistent equation can be used .",
    "equation [ eqn : qzero ] is appropriate for all forms of lattice .",
    "simplifications can also be made in the more useful case where @xmath43 if there is particle - hole symmetry , for example if the lattice is square ( or hypercubic ) and only has near - neighbor hopping .",
    "then @xmath44 , so @xmath45 , and the susceptibility simplifies to @xmath46    the two particle cluster susceptibility @xmath47 $ ] is computed in a manner which is specific to the cluster solver that is used , and does not involve any coarse graining . once the cluster properties have been computed , the coarse grained lattice susceptibility can be computed using , @xmath48^{-1}+[\\bar{\\chi}^{0}]^{-1 } \\ , , \\ ] ] from which the spin and charge susceptibilities can be computed @xcite .",
    "calculation of @xmath49 is quite involved in the flex scheme and is not discussed here .",
    "i complete this article with a discussion of the applicability of the approximate scheme to multiple bands .",
    "i consider only two bands here , but similar arguments will be applicable when there are more than two bands .",
    "a very generic two - band hamiltonian has the form , @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 create electrons of distinct types ( either on different atoms of a two - atom basis , or in different orbitals of a single atom ) .",
    "@xmath53 is the electronic dispersion generated from hopping of electrons of type @xmath54 , and @xmath55 corresponds to electrons of type @xmath56 .",
    "the dispersions @xmath53 and @xmath55 typically correspond to hopping between orbitals of the same type on different sites as shown schematically as hops of amplitude @xmath8 and @xmath57 in fig .",

    "@xmath60 contains all the interaction terms between electrons of types @xmath54 and @xmath56 within the cell .",

    "the self - energy is constant within each sub - zone .",
    "in contrast to the one - band case , the sum on @xmath0 can not always be replaced by a density of states .",
    "this is because @xmath53 , @xmath55 and @xmath58 do not normally have the same form . under certain conditions it is possible to make the replacement and therefore use the analytic forms of the self - consistency considered in this article . in the first case ,",
    "bands with dispersion @xmath58 are formed via nearest - neighbor hops in a system with a basis of two atoms , and @xmath53 and @xmath55 are flat , representing the energies of the atomic sites .",
    "then the sum over momenta is replaced by an integral over the density of states corresponding to @xmath58 , which can then be replaced using one of the simplified analytic forms considered in section [ section : dca ] .",
    "i note that two - band systems of this type have been studied using dmft @xcite .",
    "the sum over momenta can also be replaced with an integral over a density of states when @xmath79 , @xmath80 or @xmath81 ( up to an offset ) so long as any other dispersions are flat .",
    "this is possible for electrons moving between atoms with several orbitals by nearest neighbor hopping only ( the hopping integrals can be different ) as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : multibandschematic](b ) . then the density of states corresponding to only one of the dispersions can be used , since any dispersion can be represented in terms of the other dispersion . in general systems with next - nearest neighbor hopping",
    "are excluded from this argument unless there are good grounds for expecting the ratio of nearest to next - nearest neighbor hopping integrals to be identical for every band .",
    "there may be other more complicated non - linear maps between dispersions ( e.g. @xmath82 where @xmath83 is an arbitrary function ) so that the same trick can be applied , however the mapping must be @xmath84 independent so such mappings will also be special cases .",
    "this paper introduced approximate schemes for the self - consistent step of the dynamical cluster approximation . in order to simplify the self - consistent step ,",
    "the partial density of states used to calculate the green function was replaced with a simple analytic form .",
    "the limitations and errors associated with the approach were tested using the flex approximation for the self energy .",
    "the approximate schemes were demonstrated to work well for intermediate coupling over a range of fillings .",
    "the best approximate result comes from replacing the exact non - interacting dos with a gaussian .",
    "approximating using a semi - circular partial dos also leads to agreement of thermodynamic properties to within a few percent of the exact result .",
    "the semi - circular approximation leads to self - consistent equations with a much simpler form , which is promising for analytic work .",
    "finally , forms such a lorentzian and a modified finite size scheme , where only the 1st moment is matched , lead to quantitatively different results , although some of the qualitative physics remains . these schemes lead to even simpler forms for the self - consistency .",
    "examination of the green function and carrying out an analytic continuation demonstrate that the scheme can also compute dynamic properties to reasonable accuracy .",
    "i add the caveat that some properties of the 2d hubbard model may show features consistent with the influence of van hove singularities @xcite , and such singularities are not present in the simple approximations with small cluster sizes ( although they will emerge in very large clusters ) . in 3d , there are no divergences in the non - interacting density of states and spatial fluctuations are less relevant , so the schemes may be most effective for such problems .    given that the analytic forms for the self - consistency introduced here work effectively , the formalism could provide a good starting point for the calculation of analytic phase diagrams and other properties in low dimensional systems where non - local fluctuations are essential ( for example unconventional superconductivity such as @xmath56 , @xmath85 and extended-@xmath86 wave which can not be examined with the dmft ) .",
    "it is hoped that this article will stimulate such studies .",
