    "magnetic braking plays a significant role in industry .",
    "it is used to slow down the moving parts of systems without losing energy to friction . in addition",
    ", the absence of frictional forces and direct physical contact between moving parts helps these parts last longer .",
    "thus , an improved understanding of magnetic damping is important to the development of future technology in regenerative braking . in industry ,",
    "complex computational models are often used to simulate realistic scenarios of magnetic braking .",
    "we have developed a fully theoretical model for a cylindrically symmetric system , which can be used to benchmark these computational models .",
    "we present here an analysis of a common demonstration that comprises a cylindrical magnet and a non - ferromagnetic conducting tube in relative motion to each other .",
    "owing to the interaction between the moving magnet and the induced current in the pipe , the magnet falls very slowly through the tube , always generating a sense of amazement in students and teachers alike .",
    "this area has been explored by many researchers @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the motion of a cylindrical neodymium magnet through a copper pipe of circular cross - section .",
    "the azimuthal symmetry of the problem keeps the mathematics tractable and allows us to generate an analytical expression for the emf generated in an arbitrary segment of the tube , and the resulting retarding force .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : experimental setup ] , we will describe the experimental setup used for this demonstration . in sec .",
    "[ sec : magnetic field ] , we develop our model assuming the near - uniformity of magnetization of neodymium magnets , and then show that the resulting prediction of the magnetic field strength has excellent agreement with the measured values of the field on the axis of the magnet .",
    "we also compare the experimental results with the often used point dipole approximation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : comp of flux ] , from the model constructed in the previous section , we compute the flux through circular loops of the conducting pipe and generate an expression for the current in a section of pipe of arbitrary length . as a special case , in sec .",
    "v , we also compute the current generated in the forward half of the pipe ( or alternatively in the wake of the magnet ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : comp of retarding force ] , we compute the force on the magnet due to the interaction between the magnet and the pipe .",
    "our analytical results match extremely well with experimental observations . in the next section",
    ", we describe our experimental setup .",
    "as shown in fig . ( [ fig : velocity setup ] ) , we used hanging masses , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , to pull a cylindrical neodymium magnet through a copper pipe with varying terminal velocities .",
    "we used smart pulleys from pasco to record the position , velocity , and acceleration of the magnet as it traveled into , through , and out of the pipe .",
    "( [ fig : velocity and acc runs ] ) shows that for a significant segment of each individual trajectory of the magnet , the velocity remains constant .",
    ".35     .35     we also find that the dependence of the resistive force on the terminal velocity can be accurately modeled by a linear relation . as we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : comp of retarding force ] , this linear behavior is replicated by our theoretical analysis as well .",
    "researchers have studied the damped oscillatory motion of a magnet in a conducting tube @xcite . however , in this work , we have limited ourselves to an analytical study of the emf and the retarding force for a magnet moving with different terminal velocities .",
    "in order to quantitatively express the magnetic field , we need to develop an appropriate model of our magnet .",
    "several authors have considered the magnet to be a pure dipole .",
    "this model works well for small magnets moving through wide pipes .",
    "some have also considered a physical dipole constructed of two point monopoles separated by an appropriate distance @xcite .",
    "this too would be a good approximation when the radius of the magnet is much smaller than the diameter of the pipe , and the monopoles are well inside the magnet ; i.e. , not too close to the surface .",
    "our aim is to keep the analysis general and accessible to undergraduate students . in particular , we specifically include the case where the dimension of the magnet is comparable to the diameter of the pipe and generates strong braking . for such cases , as we will show in fig .",
    "( [ fig : axialdata ] ) , the dipole model does not accurately fit the data .",
    "neodymium magnets have a very uniform magnetization .",
    "this uniformity allows us to simulate the @xmath2-field of the cylindrical magnet by two circular disks with uniform magnetic surface charge densities , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath3 is proportional to the magnetization density @xmath5 of the magnet @xcite .",
    "the method of determining the @xmath6-field is then identical to the case of finding the electric field due to two uniformly charged parallel disks of surface charge densities , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in @xcite , the authors had recognized that applicability of the two - disk model for this case , however , they later chose to approximate it by a physical dipole consisting of two monopoles .",
    "the magnetic field due to a current density @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 @xmath9 includes the  free - currents \" @xmath11 and the bound current density @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the magnetization density ( magnetic moment per unit volume ) .",
    "thus , in the presence of magnetization , we have @xmath14 for a permanent magnet ; i.e. , @xmath15 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : modifiedampere ] ) yields : @xmath16 where we have defined the conservative field @xmath6 such that @xmath17 since @xmath18 , we have @xmath19 comparing this equation with gauss law @xmath20 , we see that the @xmath6-field is generated by the source @xmath21 exactly in the same way as the electrostatic field @xmath22 is found from the electrical charge density @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath6 is a conservative field , we can write it as a gradient of a scalar field .",
