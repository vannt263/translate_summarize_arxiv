    "another motivation for invoking the embedded planet scenario is the perseverance of the ring itself .",
    "the nicmos image shows that the surface brightness has a maximum at 70 au with a sharp decline at the smaller radii and an inner cutoff near 50 au . outside this region ,",

    "only after these cores have acquired a few earth - masses does dynamical accretion of gas become possible ( pollack _ et al .",
    "but , beyond the orbit of neptune , the formation of a few earth masses core requires at least several @xmath26 yr ( @xmath27 ) unless the mass of solid material is much larger than that inferred from the minimum mass solar nebula model ( lissauer 1993 ) . assuming an initial surface density 10 - 20 times that of the minimum mass solar nebula ( which corresponds to 150 - 300 @xmath28 within the annulus between @xmath29 au ) , kenyon _ et al . _",

    "since our results are insensitive to the detailed nature of the global radial dependence of @xmath36 , we choose such a power law so that the disk mass remains finite at large @xmath34 .",

    "<S> there have been several model analyses of the near and mid ir flux from the circumstellar ring around hr4796a . in one set of models , the 10 and 18 @xmath0 ir flux has been attributed to the reprocessing of stellar radiation by @xmath0-size particles . since these particles are being blown away , on a dynamical time - scale , by the radiation pressure of hr4796a , they must be continually replenished by the collisional fragments of larger particles . </S>",
    "<S> if the ring appearance persisted for the life span ( @xmath1 yr ) of hr4796a , a parent - particle reservoir with a total mass greater than @xmath2 would be needed . in order to avoid being conspicuous at longer wavelengths , most of the mass </S>",
    "<S> must be contained in parent particles larger than @xmath3 cm . in other models </S>",
    "<S> , it has been suggested that the ir flux from the rings is emitted by sufficiently large particles that survive the radiative blow out by their host star . in a gas free ring , </S>",
    "<S> greater than @xmath4-size particles would survive radiative blow out and a total of @xmath5 would be adequate to account for the observed ir flux . </S>",
    "<S> but , in the vicinity of a young star , the possibility that the dust ring is embedded within a residual protostellar gas disk can not be ruled out . in a gas - rich environment , larger sizes ( @xmath6 ) </S>",
    "<S> are needed for the particles to survive the radiative blow out . </S>",
    "<S> the total dust mass required to account for the ir flux is @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the combined influence of gas and stellar radiation may also account for the observed sharp inner boundary and rapidly fading outer boundary of the ring . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure gradient induced by a small ( @xmath8 ) amplitude variation in the surface density distribution of a low - mass gaseous disk would be sufficient to modify the rotation speed of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting hydrodynamic drag on modest - size ( @xmath9 m ) particles would be adequate to compensate for the turbulent stirring , radiative drag and radiation pressure such that they remain gravitationally bound to the system . </S>",
    "<S> the required surface density variation of the gas may be induced by 1 ) the perturbation of a low - mass planet or the binary companion hr 4796b , 2 ) the photo evaporation of the disk , or 3 ) from the variations in the viscous angular momentum transport and mass diffusion rate in the disk . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the structure of the dust ring is preserved during and after the gas is being depleted such that similar rings may be common among early - type stars . </S>"
