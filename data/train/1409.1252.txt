    "<S> the concept of disorder induced localisation has been introduced in the seminal work by anderson @xcite who captured the mechanism responsible for the absence of diffusion of waves in disordered media . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism is specifically well understood in the single - particle case , where one can show that in the presence of a suitable random potential , all eigenfunctions are exponentially localised @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this spectral characterisation of localisation there is a notion of dynamical localisation , which requires that the transition amplitudes between lattice sites decay exponentially @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> many aspects are not fully understood and a comprehensive definition is still lacking . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the case of single - particle anderson localisation , there are two complementary approaches to capture the phenomenon . on the one hand probes involving real - time dynamics @xcite have been discussed , showing excitations `` getting stuck '' , or seeing suitable signatures in density - auto - correlation functions @xcite , leading to a dynamic reading of the phenomena . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> statistics of energy levels has been considered as an indicator @xcite as well as a lack of entanglement in the eigenbasis @xcite and a resulting violation of the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis ( eth ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in such a static description of many - body localisation , it has for example been suggested to define many - body localised states as those states that can be prepared from product states or slater determinants of single - particle localised states with a finite - depth local unitary transformation . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , a many - body localised phase is one where most eigenvectors have this property @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it seems fair to say that the connection between these static and dynamic readings is still unclear . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we make a substantial first step in relating these approaches : if the evolution of an interacting many - body system is dynamically localising ( and its spectrum is generic ) , then all eigenvectors have exponentially clustering correlations in general and , in one dimension , satisfy an area law and can be efficiently written as a matrix - product state ( mps ) @xcite with a low bond dimension . </S>",
    "<S> our proof uses advanced mathematical tools developed for the analysis of interacting many - body systems , such as energy filtering and does not rely on the precise details of the considered model . </S>",

    "<S> for any local hamiltonian of this sort there is an upper bound @xmath8 to the largest group velocity , referred to as lieb - robinson velocity . </S>",
    "<S> there are several possible formulations of such a bound ( see appendix [ lr ] for a detailed discussion ) . </S>",
    "<S> one convenient and common way is to compare the time - evolution of a local observable @xmath9 under the full hamiltonian @xmath10 with its time - evolution under a truncated hamiltonian @xmath11 that only includes interactions @xmath2 contained in a region of distance no more than @xmath12 from the support of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the lieb - robinson theorem then states that there exists a constant @xmath13 and a velocity @xmath8 such that @xmath14 is true for all times @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> such a bound limits the _ speed of information propagation _ : in any such lattice with short - ranged interactions , all interactions are causal in this sense . </S>",

    "<S> our assumptions are , however , considerably weaker than assuming fully non - degenerate energy gaps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another quantity that will be important later on is the number of states up to energy @xmath31 given by @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ notions of dynamical localisation . </S>",
    "<S> _ one defining feature of localisation is that the system shows no transport of information . </S>",
    "<S> there are many possible readings of this . </S>",
    "<S> the first and strongest is that the time evolution can be truncated to a finite region independent of time and is directly connected to an absence of thermalisation in the model ( see appendix [ absence ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> [ df_dynamical_localisation ] a hamiltonian @xmath10 exhibits strong dynamical localisation iff its time evolution satisfies @xmath33 for a suitable @xmath34 , where @xmath4 is an arbitrary local observable , @xmath35 a constant independent of the system size and @xmath11 denotes a hamiltonian which includes all interactions contained in a region of distance no more than @xmath12 from the support of @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to setting the lieb - robinson velocity @xmath36 to zero in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> a potential candidate for such a model is given by free fermionic systems with strong local disorder . </S>",
    "<S> there , it is known that transport is strongly suppressed and it is still being debated to what extent they satisfy zero velocity lieb - robinson bounds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this definition also implies that information can not be transported by encoding it locally in the chosen hamiltonian ( see appendix [ lr ] for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> as such , it does not allow for a growth of entanglement entropies logarithmically in time , a phenomenon that has been numerically observed in spin chains with random onsite noise @xcite .    in a second step , we relax our dynamical assumption to a weaker variant of zero velocity lieb - robinson bounds and restricting it to a suitable subspace . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to assume that the transport properties of an electronic system are closely connected to the energy available in the system . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , often the notion of a _ mobility edge _ is introduced @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the intuition is that for all energies below this mobility edge , transport is fully blocked , while it might be possible for higher energies . the following definition is making this precise and allows for transport in highly excited sectors .    </S>",

    "<S> that is , all transport is suppressed for states supported only on the low - energy sector below energy @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> this definition relies on a rather weak version of zero velocity lieb - robinson bounds ( see appendix [ lr ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> while our results will be applicable to all eigenvectors below the mobility edge , they can naturally also be used to capture the ground state , yielding an extension of the previous results @xcite .    in experiments , </S>",
    "<S> a natural setting for dynamical localisation is one where a system is excited locally . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in case of a ground state vector @xmath42 , this corresponds to the action of a unitary operator @xmath43 with local support @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes its generator . in this </S>",
    "<S> setting , suppression of transport means that the excitation can not be measured at far distances , even for long times , in the sense that @xmath46 for arbitrary observables @xmath4 . here @xmath47 are constants independent of the time @xmath38 and the system size . </S>",
    "<S> if excitations are stuck in the above sense in an entire certain energy subspace , then this implies our zero velocity lieb - robinson estimate in eq .  , thus relating definition [ def : subsp_loc ] to a quantity that can in principle be experimentally measured ( see appendix [ lr ] ) .    </S>",

    "<S> _ we are now in the position to state our main result . </S>",
    "<S> it provides a clear link between the dynamical properties of the system and the static correlation behaviour of the corresponding eigenvectors and can be applied to quantum systems of arbitrary dimension . in one dimension </S>",
    "<S> it directly implies an area law and the existence of an approximating mps ( see corollary [ mps_theorem ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> [ main_theorem ] the dynamical properties of a local hamiltonian imply clustering correlations of its eigenvectors in the following way .    * </S>",
    "<S> if the hamiltonian shows strong dynamical localisation and its spectrum fulfils assumptions * ai * and * aii * then all its eigenvectors @xmath48 have exponentially clustering correlations , i.e. @xmath49 * if the hamiltonian has a mobility edge at energy @xmath50 and its spectrum fulfils assumptions * ai * and * aiii * , then all eigenvectors @xmath48 up to that energy @xmath50 cluster exponentially , in the sense that for all @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number of eigenstates up to energy @xmath31 and @xmath54 can be chosen arbitrarily to optimise the bound .        part * b * of the theorem only requires lieb - robinson bounds on a subspace and is thus perfectly compatible with a growth of entanglement entropies following quenches . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for the proof it is sufficient to assume eq . on the level of the individual eigenstates ( see appendix [ proof : part_b ] ) . it further allows to freely choose an energy cut - off @xmath54 that serves as an artificial energy gap and can be used to optimise the bound . for typical local models , we expect the density of states to behave like a gaussian , an intuition that can be numerically tested for small systems ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : gaussian ] ) , and rigorously proved in a weak sense @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the number of states will behave like a low - order polynomial in the system size at energies close to the ground state energy @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> thus fixing a @xmath51 independent of the system size will lead to a pre - factor that scales like a low - order polynomial in the system size where the order of the polynomial will increase as one moves to higher energies . in the bulk of the spectrum , the number of states will grow exponentially with the system size , thus rendering our bounds useless as one moves to high energies . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this feature of stronger correlations , associated with a larger entanglement in the state , at higher energies seems to be shared by the heisenberg chain with random on - site magnetic field ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : gaussian ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> naturally our theorem can also be applied to the ground state where it extends previous results @xcite and for example for the case of an almost degenerate ground state will be a substantial improvement . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , our results can also be applied to the highly excited states at the other end of the spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> the proofs for both parts of the theorem rely on energy filtering techniques @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a versatile tool especially in the study of perturbation bounds for hamiltonian systems and allows to partly diagonalise a local observable in the energy eigenbasis , while still keeping some locality structure . </S>",
    "<S> energy filtering of an observable is defined as @xmath56 here @xmath57 is a _ </S>",
    "<S> filter function _ that can be used to interpolate between locality of the resulting observable and the strength of the off - diagonal elements in the hamiltonian basis ( see appendix [ appendix : filtering ] ) .    in order to show part </S>",
    "<S> * a * of the theorem , we will make use of energy filterings of the local observables @xmath4 and @xmath5 with respect to the full hamiltonian @xmath10 as well as with respect to local restrictions @xmath20 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> those restrictions contain the support of the corresponding observable and are chosen as large as possible , while still satisfying @xmath58=0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea is to choose a suitable ( gaussian ) filter function @xmath59 and use the gap assumptions * ai * and * aii * to show that the joint filter of the observables @xmath60 decouples into energy filters for @xmath4 and @xmath5 separately . </S>",
    "<S> then strong dynamical localisation can be used to make these filters local . finally choosing the width of the energy filter @xmath61 small enough , and in particular exponentially small in the system size , </S>",
    "<S> allows to conclude the proof ( for details see appendix [ part_a ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of part * b * of the theorem is more involved , relies on a high - pass filter ( see appendix [ appendix : filtering ] ) and is contained in appendix [ proof : part_b ] .    </S>",
    "<S> _ implications on area laws and matrix - product states . </S>",
    "<S> _ in one dimension , the conclusions of our main theorem about the correlation behaviour of eigenvectors can be turned into a statement about their entanglement structure . </S>",
    "<S> it has been noted before that many - body localisation should be connected to eigenvectors fulfilling an area law ( see conjecture 1 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , and eigenvectors being well approximated by matrix - product state vectors of the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the bond dimension and @xmath64 for all @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> our main theorem allows to rigorously prove this connection .    </S>",
    "<S> [ mps_theorem ] an eigenvector @xmath48 of a localising hamiltonian can be approximated by an mps with fidelity @xmath66 , where the bond dimension for a sufficiently large system is given as follows .    </S>",
    "<S> * if the hamiltonian shows strong dynamical localisation and its spectrum fulfils assumptions * ai * and * aii * , then the statement holds for all eigenvectors @xmath48 and , for some constant @xmath67 , the approximation has a bond dimension @xmath68 * if the hamiltonian has a mobility edge at energy @xmath37 , and its spectrum fulfils assumptions * ai * and * aiii * , then the statement holds for all eigenvectors below this energy @xmath37 and the bond dimension is given by @xmath69 for any fixed @xmath54 which enters in the precise form of the polynomial .    </S>",
    "<S> the proof is a direct consequence of our main theorem together with the fact that exponential clustering in one dimension implies strong bounds on entanglement entropies between any bipartite cut of the chain @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using techniques from @xcite this leads to an efficient mps approximation with the above bounds on the bond dimension ( see appendix [ mps_proof ] for details ) .    _ summary & outlook . _ despite considerable progress in understanding the effects of random potentials on quantum many - body systems , a precise definition of the phenomenon of many - body localisation continues to be elusive . </S>",
    "<S> attempts to capture the phenomenology can largely be classified into two complementary approaches : one of them puts characteristic properties of the eigenfunctions into the focus of attention and asks for a lack of entanglement and a violation of the eth . </S>",
    "<S> the other one takes the suppression of transport as the basis , which seems closer to being experimentally testable .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we have established a clear link between these two approaches , by showing that dynamical localisation implies that eigenvectors cluster exponentially . </S>",
    "<S> this result , together with the existence of an approximating mps description in one dimension , reminds of the definition of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , that defines many - body localisation in terms of matrix - product state approximations of eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in our work , this feature is shown to follow from an absence of transport . for future research </S>",
    "<S> , it would be interesting to further explore this connection and to address the converse direction , namely to establish that an area - law for all eigenvectors implies that excitations can not travel through the system .    a different approach towards approximating the individual eigenstates with a matrix - product state </S>",
    "<S> could potentially be provided by constructing meaningful local constants of motion that give a set of local quantum numbers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it seems likely that tools using energy filtering will again prove useful in this context , a prospect that we briefly discuss in appendix [ constants ] . on the practical side , further numerical effort will be needed to understand the behaviour of individual models and to fully understand the transport properties for different energy scales . </S>",
    "<S> our work could well provide a first stepping stone for further endeavours in this direction : showing that eigenstates are well approximated by matrix - product states implies that not only ground states , but in fact also excited states can efficiently be described in terms of tensor networks . </S>",
    "<S> our result as such does not yet provide an efficient algorithm to find the respective matrix - product states : this reminds of the situation of the existence of lattice models for which the ground states are exact matrix - product states , but it amounts to a computationally difficult problem to find them @xcite . still , this appears to be a major step in the direction of formulating such numerical prescriptions of describing the low - energy sector of many - body localizing systems . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , the leading vision in any of these endeavours appears to be a rigorous proof of many - body localisation in the spirit of the original results by anderson . for this , creating a unifying framework and linking the possible definitions seems a key first step .    </S>",
