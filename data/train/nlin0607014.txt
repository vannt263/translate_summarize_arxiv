    "we always take the particle s energy , @xmath4 , to be smaller than @xmath3 so that the particle is confined to @xmath5 .",
    "an important question is whether the billiard and the smooth flows are similar for sufficiently small @xmath6  in particular  whether the billiard s ergodicity property is preserved .",
    "a definite answer to such a question requires a well defined limiting procedure @xcite . for finite - range axis - symmetric potentials",
    "it was shown that some configurations remain ergodic @xcite , while other configurations may possess stability islands @xcite .",
    "recently , it was established that in the most general two - dimensional settings of dispersing billiards ( not necessarily axis - symmetric nor of finite range ) the answer is definitely negative ; it was proved that there are two mechanisms for the creation of stability islands for arbitrarily small @xmath6 .",
    "one mechanism is a tangency  periodic orbits or homoclinic orbits which are tangent to the billiard s boundary produce islands @xcite .",
    "another mechanism are corners  a sequence of regular reflections which begins and ends in a corner ( termed a _ corner polygon _ ) may , under some prescribed conditions , produce stable periodic orbits @xcite . in both cases",
    "it was shown that a two - parameter family of potentials @xmath7 ( @xmath6 is the softness parameter and @xmath8 is responsible for a regular continuous change of the billiard s geometry ) possesses a wedge in the @xmath9-plane , at which the hamiltonian flow has an elliptic periodic orbit .",
    "this orbit limits to the tangent billiard orbit/ the corner polygon as @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , a method for estimating the width of the stability wedge in the parameter space and of the area of the elliptic islands in the phase space was developed ; for typical potentials both quantities have a power - law dependence on @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these findings were realized experimentally using cold atoms in atom - optics billiards @xcite . in the experiments ,",
    "a mixing billiard domain is drawn by a fast moving laser beam which encloses cold atoms .",
    "a small gap is opened after an initial run time , and the fact that the decay rate of the remaining atoms depends on the gap location demonstrates that the dynamics is not mixing and that some of the particles are trapped in stability islands .",
    "the numerical simulations of the experiments show that islands are indeed produced by corner polygons @xcite .",
    "much less is known on the dynamics in multi - dimensional billiards ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "motivated by the boltzmann hypothesis regarding the ergodicity of hard sphere gas , the ergodicity property of hard - wall semi - dispersing billiards were extensively studied ( see @xcite and reference there in ) .",
    "nowhere dispersing ergodic billiards in @xmath12 with @xmath11 were constructed in @xcite . in these papers and in @xcite examples of three - dimensional semi - focusing billiards with mixed phase space were presented .",
    "conditions under which multi - dimensional billiards with finite range spherically symmetric potentials are hyperbolic were found in @xcite .",
    "a semiclassical study of three - dimensional sinai billiard was presented in @xcite .",
    "recently , the asymptotic expansion of regular ( non - tangent , away from corners ) motion in steep multi - dimensional potentials by integrals along an auxiliary multi - dimensional billiard were developed @xcite . in this work",
    "the geometry is arbitrary , and error bounds on the billiard approximation are found .    here , we demonstrate numerically , for the first time , that islands of stability are created for arbitrarily small @xmath6 in _ both two and three _ dimensional soft billiards .",
    "the ability to locate small islands of stability in the six dimensional phase space of the highly chaotic nearly - billiard @xmath13 d.o.f .",
    "flow may appear to be hopeless .",
    "three technical innovations enable us to establish these results numerically .",
    "the first idea is to construct a simple symmetric billiard , so that instead of looking for islands of stability in arbitrary places , we may concentrate on the properties of a simple periodic trajectory which exists for all small @xmath6 values by symmetry .",
    "we examine its stability properties by computing the monodromy matrix of the local return map near this orbit .",
    "inspired by @xcite , we choose a trajectory which limits , as @xmath14 , to the simplest possible corner polygon - a cord which enters a corner ( see the bold lines in fig.[fig : 2d geometry ] and fig.[fig : 3d z geometry ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in the three dimensional case , by the symmetry of the constructed billiard , the two non - trivial pairs of eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix are identical , and are thus controlled by a single parameter .",
    "the second idea is that by using proper rescaling it is possible to integrate numerically the equations of motion for arbitrarily small @xmath6 . indeed ,",
    "if we fix the geometry and take small @xmath6 values we encounter the usual problem of stiffness near the boundary . on the other hand , the equivalent increase of the billiard domain by a similarity factor does not introduce a serious numerical problem since @xmath15 is small in the domain s interior .",
    "the third idea is that the boundaries of the wedges of stability in the parameter space may be found numerically by a continuation scheme on the critical eigenvalues value .",
    "thus the stability regions may be found effectively and efficiently .",
    "to construct concrete examples , we define the billiard domains as the region exterior to several spheres @xmath16 with centers at @xmath17 and radii @xmath18 : @xmath19 for the two dimensional case we take three circles ( fig.[fig : 2d geometry ] ) .",
    "the first two circles @xmath20 intersect at the point @xmath21 where @xmath22 and the third circle , which has a larger radius , has @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "the angle between the tangents to the two circles at @xmath25 is given by : @xmath26 so that when @xmath27 these circles are tangent and @xmath28 . the cord @xmath29 is a _ corner polygon _ : at @xmath30it reflects from the large circle @xmath31 according to the billiard s reflection law ( @xmath32 ) and at @xmath33 it enters a corner .",
    "we will study the behavior of the smooth system near this corner polygon , thus the closing of the billiard domain away from this line is irrelevant here .",
    "it may be achieved by a union of a finite number of dispersing smooth boundaries which meet at non - zero angles , or by enclosing the whole system in a large box . for all @xmath34",
    "the family of billiard tables thus defined belong to the class of sinai billiards - they are mixing dynamical systems , having one ergodic component and a positive lyapunov exponent for almost all initial conditions .",

    "the cord @xmath35 is denoted by the bold line.,width=264 ]     the radius of the circles is @xmath36 .",
    "dotted line : @xmath37 , solid line : @xmath38 , dashed line : @xmath39 . , width=264 ]    similarly , in the three - dimensional case , we take four spheres ( fig . [",
    "fig : 3d_geometry],[fig : 3d z geometry],[fig : 3d xa geometry ] ) .",
    "three spheres have equal radii @xmath40 and have equidistant centers : @xmath41 @xmath42 .",
    "these three spheres intersect , for @xmath43 , at @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "the fourth sphere , of radius @xmath46 , is located at a distance @xmath47 from the corner point : @xmath48 .",
    "the angle between the pairs of tangent lines to the circles of intersections of pairs of spheres is : @xmath49 so @xmath50 corresponds to the case @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , the cord @xmath52 is a corner polygon . here",
    "again we can close the billiard domain by adding a finite number of dispersing surfaces which intersect each other in finite angles , or by a large box , so that for all @xmath34 the resulting billiard domain is compact and dispersing .",
    "note that if we rescale all the spheres and the distances between them by a fixed scale @xmath53 , the billiards geometry will not change and the corresponding corner angles remain unchanged .",
    "consider the smooth motion in this region which is induced by the potential @xmath54 ; @xmath55 may be taken as the gaussian potential associated with the boundary component @xmath16 : @xmath56@xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the distance between @xmath59 and the circle @xmath60@xmath61 and @xmath62 is the softness parameter . in the cold atom experiment @xmath62 corresponds to the width of the laser beam @xcite , and @xmath63 corresponds to the averaged effective gaussian potential which bounds the atoms .",
    "previously , we established that as this potential tends to a hard wall potential ( @xmath64 ) , regular reflections of the smooth flow tend to those of the billiard @xcite . by the symmetric placement of the spheres ,",
    "it is clear that for any @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 ) , there exists a periodic solution @xmath67 which limits , as @xmath64 to the corner polygon @xmath35 .",
    "notice that studying this system for a fixed @xmath62 and a billiard domain which is increased proportionally by a factor @xmath53 ( so @xmath68 ) , is equivalent to studying it in a fixed geometry with @xmath62 replaced by @xmath69 .",
    "thus , by increasing the domain size we may approach the limit @xmath10 without the numerical problems associated with the stiff limit @xmath64 .     at @xmath70 as a function of @xmath71 for 2d and 3d.,height=245 ]",

    "right : wedges of stability in the parameter space . , height=207 ]     ( bold ) at @xmath70 .",
    "right : wedges of stability in the parameter space .",
    "see fig.[fig : 3d phase ] for phase portraits the parameter values corresponding to a - d .",
    ", height=207 ]    from the analysis of @xcite we expect that the stability of @xmath72 will depend non - trivially on both @xmath6 and the geometrical parameter of the billiard @xmath8 and that near @xmath73 islands will appear ( the limit @xmath74 at which the billiard is not a sinai billiard , and thus billiard orbits may be trapped for arbitrarily large number of reflections near the corner has not been studied in @xcite ) .",
    "we find that all the regions in the @xmath75 plane at which islands of stability associated with @xmath72 exist ( other islands of stability may co - exist ) , emerge from @xmath70 at some finite @xmath76 values , and converge towards @xmath77 .",
    "hence , we first find the stability of @xmath78 by computing the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix of the return map to the local cross - section at @xmath79 for a range of @xmath6 values .",
    "since there is always a pair of neutral eigenvalues corresponding to the flow direction , for the 2d case the monodromy matrix has the eigenvalues @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the largest eigenvalue which is different from 1 . in the 3d case , due to the symmetric form of the geometry ,",
    "the spectrum is of the form @xmath82(i.e .",
    "saddle - foci do not appear ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : 2d_3d lam_eps ] the real part of @xmath81 is shown for a range of @xmath6 values for the 2d and 3d cases .",
    "the large oscillations from positive to negative values guarantee the existence of intervals of @xmath6 at which  @xmath83 - on these intervals @xmath81 is imaginary and belongs to the unit circle . in the left panels of fig.[fig : 2d parameter ] and fig.[fig : 3d parameter ] we present an enlarged segment of fig .",
    "[ fig : 2d_3d lam_eps ] with a regular @xmath6 scale .",
    "these calculations are used to find the values of @xmath84 at which @xmath85 , where a saddle - center and a period doubling bifurcations occurs respectively ( in the three dimensional case these are double - bifurcation points due to the symmetry ) .",
    "then , starting at @xmath86 , we use a continuation method for finding the bifurcation curves for @xmath34 , as shown in the right panels of fig.[fig : 2d parameter ] and fig.[fig : 3d parameter ] . in the wedges enclosed by these two curves",
    "the periodic orbit @xmath72 is elliptic , with flouqet multipliers @xmath87 ( in the three dimensional case each multiplier has multiplicity two ) , and @xmath88 varies between @xmath89 and @xmath90 as the wedges are crossed .",
    "one expects that this linear stability will also result in nonlinear stability for most ( non - resonant ) @xmath88 values .",
    "more elaborate study of the resonances and the relation to the analytic predictions of @xcite are of interest but are beyond the scope of the current paper . for the two dimensional case , we verified that indeed the phase portraits one obtains as a wedge of stability is crossed are the familiar islands which appear near a saddle - center and a hamiltonian period - doubling bifurcations ( e.g. as in the hamiltonian hnon map ) .        in the three dimensional case , for all @xmath88 values , the multipliers are in @xmath91 resonance due to the symmetry . for generic systems , for almost all @xmath88 values ( values which are non - resonant with the frequency of @xmath72 ) , we expect to have non - linear stability ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , projections of the four dimensional symplectic return map to @xmath79 for several @xmath92 values are shown in fig.[fig : 3d phase ] .",
    "it is demonstrated that indeed inside the wedged region @xmath72 is nonlinearly stable for the full integration time ( approximately 4000 periods ) . moreover ,",
    "if we add a sufficiently small , a - symmetric perturbation to the potential ( e.g. @xmath93 with @xmath94 ) we find that the effective stability region still persists .",
    "for the phase - space simulations we use a symplectic integrator ( gnicodes @xcite ) , which keeps @xmath4 up to accuracy of @xmath95 .",
    "thus , we can confidently detect islands with transversal kinetic energy of up to @xmath96 ( so @xmath97 ) .",
    "this limits our phase - space calculations to @xmath98  smaller values of @xmath99 produce smaller islands and their detection via phase space plots requires a higher accuracy in the integration .",
    "we stress though that the calculations of the bifurcation curves are accurate for much smaller @xmath99 values ; in these calculation only a single return map is computed and there exists a sharp transition between large positive and large negative values of the eigenvalues ( see left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : 2d parameter],[fig : 3d parameter ] ) , so the existence of elliptic regimes is guaranteed . comparing the 2d and 3d wedges of stability",
    "it appears that the 3d wedges are indeed narrower .",
    "while the appearance of islands in two - degrees of freedom steep hamiltonian systems is somewhat expected , the mechanisms for their appearance in the higher dimensional settings is not as well understood ( see @xcite for some generic possibilities ) .",
    "furthermore , their appearance guarantees only effective stability due to the possible existence of arnold diffusion @xcite . nonetheless , by kam theory , in the non - degenerate case , a large set of initial conditions belongs to kam tori and thus stay forever near the stable periodic orbit .",
    "thus , the existence of islands in the higher dimensional setting _ implies that ergodicity is destroyed _ independently of the possible leakage out of the effective stability zone after an exponentially long time .",
    "this latter possibility suggests that stickiness may be an interesting event also in this higher dimensional setting .    here ,",
    "we propose for the first time a mechanism for the creation of stability islands for smooth systems which are arbitrarily close to strictly dispersing three dimensional billiards ; we showed that potentials @xmath100 that become arbitrarily steep as @xmath101 possess wedges in the @xmath102-plane at which a periodic orbit is elliptic .",
    "thus , on one hand , there exist one - parameter families of potentials @xmath103 which have a stable periodic orbit for arbitrarily small @xmath6 . since we showed that in the wedges @xmath104 as @xmath10 , it follows that these potentials have islands of stability even when they are _ arbitrarily close to a hard wall dispersing ( sinai ) billiards .",
    "_ on the other hand , for any fixed @xmath105 there exists an interval of positive @xmath6 values for which islands of stability exist .",
    "thus , these islands may be destroyed by either making the potential steeper or softer  a somewhat non - intuitive result .",
