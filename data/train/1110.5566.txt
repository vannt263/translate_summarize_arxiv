    ", the readout has to be faster than the qubit relaxation time .",
    "moreover , to implement quantum error correction , the readout time must be less than the decoherence time .",
    "the relaxation processes can be of different origin ( even due to the qubit - vacuum interaction ) .",
    "also , the effects of measuring devices on the behavior of qubit states during the readout time are of great importance @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the simplest scheme for fast qubit readout of the phase qubit , based on the tunneling effect , ( single - shot measurement ) has been implemented and studied in @xcite-@xcite . according to this scheme",
    ", the measurement pulse adiabatically reduces the barrier between the potential wells , one of which forms the qubit states . as a result , the qubit in the upper state switches by tunneling into the neighboring well with probability close to one , while the qubit in the lower state remains unchanged .",
    "this kind of readout is limited by the strong current noise back action from the measurement device on the qubit . moreover",
    ", this demolition measurement process destroys the qubit states which is unacceptable for most applications .",
    "the scheme of dispersive readout of qubit states has evident advantages . in what follows",
    ", we consider the case in which an external device probes the qubit state indirectly via a transmission line resonator ( a two sided cavity ) weakly coupled to the qubit .",
    "this scheme allows repeated measurements .",
    "the presence of the qubit - resonator coupling causes the resonator eigenfrequency to be dependent on the qubit state .",
    "hence , the number of photons in the resonator , being dependent on the probe field - resonator detuning , depends on the qubit state .",
    "( this number is maximal for zero detuning . ) for this reason , the field going out of the resonator contains information about the resonator state as well as about the qubit state .",
    "the amplitude of the transmitted field depends on the photon number in the resonator and on the resonator leakage .",
    "the increase of both quantities results in an increase of the transmitted signal that in general improves the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "however , both of these factors decrease the qubit relaxation time due to the qubit - resonator interaction .",
    "moreover , resonators with high leakage ( low quality factor ) lose their ability to filter out those external noises which penetrate into the low - temperature region from the  external world \" . also ,",
    "for a relatively large number of photons in the resonator , the qubit - resonator interaction can not be considered to be weak , and the advantages of the dispersive measurement , based on the perturbation approach , disappear .",
    "the optimal choice of both the readout strategy and the setup parameters can be facilitated by means of theoretical description of the physical processes involved in the course of readout . in what follows ,",
    "we use our recent approach @xcite which makes it possible to obtain explicit expressions for the photon numbers and the measurement - induced relaxation rate of the qubit .",
    "we derive a set of inequalities which are required to provide a single - shot dispersive measurement , and we present examples of the qubit and resonator parameters .",
    "as in our previous paper @xcite , we consider a flux - biased phase qubit embedded in a symmetric transmission line by a set of distributed inductances and capacitances .",

    "( see refs . @xcite and @xcite . )    the qubit - resonator interaction term ( the fourth term in ( [ one ] ) ) couples the variables of both subsystems .",
    "it is evident that only even harmonics of the transmission line are coupled with the qubit .",

    "this interaction strength , @xmath1 , is given by the expression , @xmath17 for calculational simplicity , we approximated the potential energy of the qubit by a parabolic dependence on the effective coordinate .",

    "( [ sev ] ) that this condition can easily be satisfied by increasing the measurement time and ( or ) by increasing the leakage parameter , @xmath48 .",
    "unfortunately , both ways have evident disadvantages in view of possible applications of qubits : ( a ) quantum computers require fast measurements and ( b ) large values of @xmath48 result in small quality factors , @xmath77 , for the resonators ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the last circumstance can shorten the lifetime of the excited qubit state .",
    "the interplay of several factors should be taken into account for the optimal choice of the measurement strategy . in the next section",
    ", we consider this issue in more details .",
    "we start from the inequality ( [ ele ] ) , which provides a qubit to remain in the excited state ( with high probability , close to unity ) after the individual measurements . for the non - steady state , expression ( [ ele ] ) should be rewritten as : @xmath79 where @xmath75 is defined by eq .",

    "( [ eig ] ) , we have neglected unity in comparison with the average photon number , @xmath75 , in the resonator .",
    "( [ eig ] ) can be rewritten in the form , @xmath80 which is more convenient for physical interpretation . in particular , the left - hand side term is the total photon number which left the cavity during the time , @xmath50 .",
    "( [ nin ] ) establishes an upper bound on this number . at the same time",
    ", this number should be sufficiently large . in this case",
    ", the measurement process acquires classical properties in spite of the fact that a quantum state is measured .",
    "thus , we have , @xmath81    it seems that the second inequality can be easily satisfied by choosing a large qubit - resonator detuning , @xmath41 , or a small qubit - resonator interaction parameter , @xmath1 .",
    "however , the variations of these quantities are restricted by the requirement , @xmath82 which means that nonresonant eigenfrequency should be beyond the resonator bandwidth .    inequalities ( [ twe ] ) and ( [ two ] ) should be complemented by two more which were discussed in the previous sections . the first inequality concerns the validity of the dispersive approach , and follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ fou ] ) . in the case of non - steady state ,",
    "it is given by , @xmath83 the other inequality deals with the problem of the resolution of the two resonator eigenfrequencies during the measurement time , @xmath84 in summary , conditions ( [ twe])-([tth ] ) should be satisfied for nondestructive single - shot dispersive readout of the phase qubit .",
    "are these conditions non - contradictory ?",
    "is it possible to satisfy all of them , at least in some particular cases ? in the next section we will illustrate such possibilities .",
    "\\(i ) we first choose the frequencies of the resonator and the qubit , and the coupling strength as : @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "then , the frequency shift is : @xmath88 if the measurement time is a given parameter , for example , @xmath89 , then the leakage value , @xmath48 , can be taken as : @xmath90 .",
    "this quantity is sufficiently large to distinguish the contributions in @xmath91 arising from steady- and non - steady states of the resonator ( see eq .",
    "( [ thi ] ) ) . at the same time , it is not large enough to violate the conditions ( [ twe ] ) and ( [ two ] ) .    finally , it is reasonable to assume @xmath92 , hence , @xmath93 .",
    "the value of @xmath73 is sufficiently larger than the fluctuations of the outgoing photons ( in the case of poisson s statistics @xmath94 ) . on the other hand , conditions",
    "( [ twe ] ) and ( [ ttw ] ) are not violated in this case .",
    "the relaxation rate of the qubit due to the interaction with the resonator is : @xmath95 .",
    "then , the probability of remaining in the excited state after the measurement , determined by @xmath96 , is 0.9 .    the resonator quality factor is equal to @xmath97 .",
    "the relatively small value of the quality factor is due to the large leakage from the resonator .",
    "the power , coupled to the outside of the resonator , @xmath98 , determines the corresponding voltage , @xmath99 , via the relationship , @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the impedance at the output of the resonator .",
    "usually @xmath102 . then , @xmath103 .",
    "\\(ii ) for comparison , let us consider resonator and the qubit frequencies that are a factor of two larger than in the case ( i ) : @xmath104 , @xmath105 .    as before , @xmath87 .",
    "then @xmath106 if the photon numbers and measurement time remain unchanged ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath89 ) , then @xmath107 . because of the increase of @xmath5 , the quality factor as well as the ratio @xmath108 doubles .",
    "a similar tendency concerns the increase of the measurement time . for greater @xmath50 ,",
    "the value of @xmath109 can be smaller resulting in a larger quality factor .",
    "also , in this case , the output voltage , @xmath99 , increases by a factor of @xmath110 .",
    "the increase of the frequencies makes it easier to choose the desirable parameters required for a single - shot dispersive measurement .",
    "for example , it becomes possible to decrease the relaxation rate , @xmath45 , improving in this way the measurement fidelity . to show this ,",
    "let us assume in the case ( ii ) that @xmath111 .",
    "then , the relaxation time of the excited state doubles , and the measurement fidelity grows from @xmath112 to @xmath113 . in spite of the decrease of @xmath114 toward the value calculated for the case ( i ) ,",
    "the resonator lines remain well - resolved .",
    "it is important to emphasize , that a similar variation of @xmath115 in the case ( i ) will result in a very small @xmath116 being insufficient for resolving the lines .",
    "at first sight , the statement that a single - shot dispersive measurement of the phase qubit can also be nondemolition measurement appears unrealistic .",
    "a simple analysis of inequalities ( [ twe])-([tth ] ) shows that it is rather difficult to make a nondemolition measurement .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown , for particular cases , that this measurement is quite realizable , although only for a restricted range of the parameters . for performing this kind of measurement ,",
    "it is important to take into account the fact that shortening the measurement time requires a growth of the leakage , @xmath48 , thus decreasing the resolution of the resonator lines and decreasing the quality factor .",
    "moreover , a very strong drive can violate the conditions required for the dispersive measurement and it can shorten the lifetime of the qubit in the excited state .",
    "on the other hand , using resonators and qubits with high frequencies enables the choice of suitable parameters .    in this paper , we have only touched the problems of the qubit - resonator - drive noises that are very important for quantum measurements .",
    "the measurement induced noise arises from the second and third terms in square brackets of eq .",
    "( [ tve ] ) .",
    "they can be accounted for straightforwardly . nevertheless , the complete solution of this problem is possible only by accounting for the measuring scheme and the intrinsic noises of the measuring device , and by taking into consideration the noise produced by the amplifiers .",
