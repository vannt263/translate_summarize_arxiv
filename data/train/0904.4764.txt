    "in collisions of heavy - ions or of protons , a large number of photons can be measured .",
    "they can be roughly divided into photons from hadron decays and into direct photons which originate from several different sources @xcite .",
    "the first source of direct photons is non - thermal and therefore also occurs in @xmath2+@xmath2 collisions .",
    "such non - thermal photons are produced in processes described by next - to - leading order pqcd calculations , such as initial hard scatterings or bremsstrahlung emission from a scattered parton .",
    "these photons dominate the overall direct photon spectrum in heavy - ion collisions at high transverse momenta . at low transverse momenta , thermal photons @xcite",
    "are expected to be the dominant source .",
    "such thermal photons are emitted by a possible quark - gluon plasma phase as well as by the hadron gas .",
    "furthermore , photons can be emitted by the interaction of a parton jet with the medium , for example the medium can induce bremsstrahlung .",
    "such photons are expected to play a dominant role at intermediate transverse momenta .",
    "measuring direct photons in @xmath2+@xmath2 collisions is a good test of pqcd calculations .",
    "furthermore , the measurement of direct photons in @xmath2+@xmath2 is an important baseline for the understanding of direct photon production in heavy - ion collisions . through their production in quark - gluon compton scattering ,",
    "direct photons are also sensitive not only to the magnitude , but also the sign of the polarized gluon distribution and can therefore shed light on the spin structure of protons . in heavy - ion collisions , photons are a good probe as they do not interact strongly and can thus traverse a strongly interacting medium ( mostly ) unaffected . as aforementioned ,",
    "different production mechanisms are involved in creating the overall direct photon spectrum .",
    "the azimuthal anisotropy of direct photon production is expected to be sensitive to such different production mechanisms @xcite , therefore it is crucial to measure both the nuclear modification factor and the azimuthal anisotropy of direct photons in heavy - ion collisions for understanding the different production mechanisms .",
    "the phenix experiment @xcite is designed to study collisions of nuclei and of protons by looking at a large number of possible probes . the direct photon measurement presented in the following",
    "is performed within the phenix central spectrometer , located at both sides of the beam axis , covering @xmath4 in azimuth and @xmath5 in pseudorapidity .",
    "the detectors in the central spectrometer are arranged onion like , they can be subdivided roughly into three groups : tracking detectors , pid detectors , and calorimeters . tracking detectors in phenix are the drift chambers ( dc ) , the pad chambers ( pc ) , and the time expansion chamber ( tec ) .",
    "these detectors measure the tracks of charged particles and thus they play an important role in measuring electrons .",
    "particle i d detectors are a ring - imaging cerenkov detector ( rich ) , the aerogel cerenkov counter ( acc ) , and the time - of - flight detector ( tof ) .",
    "the rich separates electrons and pions below the @xmath4 cerenkov threshold of 4  gev/@xmath6 .",
    "the outermost detector in the phenix setup is an electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) for photon and electron measurement , consisting of eight sectors , each covering @xmath7 in azimuth .",
    "six of these sectors consist of a lead scintillator sandwich calorimeters , four in the west and two in the east arm .",
    "the other two sectors in the east arm consist of a lead glass cerenkov calorimeter .",
    "global detectors for centrality and reaction plane measurements include the beam - beam counters ( bbc ) and the zero - degree calorimeters ( zdc ) .",
    "a distinct reaction plane detector has been added to phenix in 2007 .",
    "the large background of decay photons from hadrons such as @xmath8 or @xmath9 makes the measurement of direct photons difficult .",
    "two different methods have been used at phenix to extract the direct photon signal from the decay photon background : the so - called subtraction method , and the so - called internal conversion method .",
    "the subtraction or statistical method has its advantages at high transverse momenta but fails to extract a significant direct photon yield at low @xmath1 due to large systematic uncertainties .",
    "it has been well established in different analyses @xcite .",
    "the idea of this method is to subtract the decay photons from the different hadronic decays from all measured photons .",
    "photon candidates are measured with the electromagnetic calorimeter , the hadron and lepton contribution to this spectrum is subtracted and the spectrum is corrected for detector effects such as the geometrical acceptance and the reconstruction efficiency , leading to a spectrum of inclusive photons @xmath10 . the spectrum of decay photons is obtained via simulations , taking the measured @xmath8 spectrum @xcite as input , and using @xmath11 scaling for the other mesons such as @xmath9 or @xmath12 .",
    "the decay photons are then not subtracted directly but via the so - called double ratio @xmath13 . in this ratio , common systematic uncertainties on the inclusive photon and the @xmath8 spectra",
    "cancel , the direct photon yield can eventually be calculated as @xmath14 .",
    "this method has also been applied in au+au collisions to reaction - plane dependent data to obtain the azimuthal anisotropy parameter @xmath3 for direct photons , and in collisions of polarized proton beams it was used for the measurement of the double longitudinal spin asymmetry @xmath15 . at low transverse momenta",
    ", the method can not be applied as the remaining systematic uncertainties are larger than the small signal .",
    "furthermore , at high transverse momenta , the merging of @xmath8 decay photons has to be taken into account .",

    "the range of the two - component fit ( as explained in the text ) is @xmath17 mev/@xmath18 .",
    "the black dashed curve shows @xmath19 outside the fit range .",
    "the mentioned excess over the hadron cocktail can also be seen , comparing the blue @xmath20 with the data points.,width=453 ]    the internal conversion method @xcite is based on the assumption that every source emitting real photons also emits virtual photons that subsequently convert into low mass electron - positron pairs .",
    "such internal conversion occurs for example in the @xmath8 dalitz decay , or when a source emits virtual photons directly .",
    "the mass distribution of such photons can be described by @xmath21 @xmath22 is the fine structure constant , @xmath23 is a process dependent form factor , @xmath24 for direct photons in case @xmath25 , or @xmath26 , while @xmath27 for the dalitz decay of @xmath8 an @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the factor @xmath28 for @xmath29 , this cut - off can be used to separate the direct photon signal from the background . + in a first analysis step , all @xmath30 pairs are measured in a certain @xmath1 region , a cut removes pairs from conversion in the detector material , while the uncorrelated background is calculated via event mixing and the correlated background is removed based on like - sign pairs .",
    "the mass distribution is then corrected for the electron reconstruction efficiency and - in the @xmath2+@xmath2 case - for the trigger efficiency .",
    "the resulting mass distribution is compared to the expectation from a simulated cocktail of hadron decays .",
    "an excess over this expectation can be seen in au+au collisions as well as - though smaller - in @xmath2+@xmath2 collisions .",
    "a possible source for such an excess are internal conversions of direct photons . in a next step ,",
    "the mass distribution is fit with a two component function @xmath31 , with @xmath20 being the shape of the cocktail mass distribution and @xmath32 as the expected shape of the direct photon internal conversion .",
