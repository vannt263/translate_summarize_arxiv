    "there have been many reviews of positron physics over the years  @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite and @xcite considered the subject with an emphasis on experimental measurements involving noble gas targets .",
    "the related topic of antihydrogen formation has also been thoroughly reviewed @xcite .",
    "resonances and the closely related bound states of positrons with atoms and molecules has also been extensively discussed  @xcite .",
    "this work concentrates on the progress in application of theoretical methods to scattering processes in a quantum few - body system involving positrons as projectiles and multi - electron atomic targets with explicit treatment of positronium formation .",
    "particular emphasis is on the developments taken place since the comprehensive review of positron physics by @xcite .",
    "it begins by describing the currently available theories of low - energy positron collisions with atoms and simple molecules .",
    "then it describes the development and application of the two - centre convergent close - coupling method , which explicitly treats the ps - formation processes .",
    "developments in positron physics have resulted in several technologies in medicine and material science . in medicine , the use of the positron emission tomography ( pet ) scanners help to make diagnoses of cancer detection and of certain brain function disorders .",
    "material science uses positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy ( pals ) , to analyze and design specific materials .",
    "the critical component is positronium ( ps ) formation with its annihilation providing the key signature of its origin .",
    "ps is a short - lived exotic atom of a bound positron - electron pair that has similar structure to atomic hydrogen .",
    "scattering experiments are the main tool of modern physics to learn about the structure of matter . by analyzing collision products we can extract useful information about the objects being studied .",
    "historically , ordinary matter particles like electrons and protons were predominantly used as scattering particles in experimental atomic and molecular physics . with",
    "the development of positron and antiproton beams , studies of interactions of these particles with matter became possible .",
    "the last decade has seen significant progress in low - energy trap - based positron beams @xcite .",
    "new high - resolution experimental measurements have been performed for a range of atomic and molecular targets including he @xcite , ne and ar @xcite , xe @xcite , kr @xcite h@xmath0 @xcite and h@xmath0o @xcite .",
    "the development of positron beams motivated novel experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "particularly important are the positronium - formation cross sections , see the recent recommendations of @xcite . in addition",
    ", interest has been motivated by possible binding of positrons to atoms  @xcite .    theoretical description of electron - impact ionisation ( and excitation ) processes has seen significant progress in recent years due to the development of various highly sophisticated methods including the exterior complex scaling ( ecs ) @xcite , r - matrix with pseudo - states ( rmps ) @xcite , time - dependent close - coupling ( tdcc ) @xcite and convergent close coupling ( ccc ) @xcite .",
    "a review of electron - induced ionisation theory has been given by @xcite .",
    "such problems are examples of a class where there is only one `` natural '' centre , namely the atomic centre .",
    "all coordinates are readily written with the origin set at the atomic centre .",
    "yet there are many atomic collision systems of practical and scientific interest that involve at least two centres , such as the positron - hydrogen scattering system .",
    "this is a three - body system where all the particles are distinguishable , and which allows for their rearrangement .",
    "here we have two `` natural '' centres , the atomic centre and the positronium ( ps ) centre . for positron - hydrogen scattering ionisation",
    "now splits into two separate components : the rearrangement process of ps - formation and the three - body breakup process .",
    "a proper formulation of ps - formation processes requires a combined basis consisting of two independent basis sets for each of the centres which makes theoretical studies considerably more challenging than for electron - scattering .",
    "furthermore , the positron - atom system is an ideal prototype of the ubiquitous collision systems such as proton - atom scattering , where charge - exchange processes also require a two - centre treatment , see @xcite for example .",
    "every positron - atom scattering system has an ionisation ( breakup ) threshold above which an electron may be freely ejected . at 6.8  ev below this threshold",
    "is the ps formation threshold . at higher energies excitation or ionization of the target",
    "can take place .",
    "in addition , for multi - electron targets there could be many more reaction channels such as multiple ionisation and ionisation - with - excitation .",
    "for molecular targets there could be rovibrational excitation and dissociation .",
    "another reaction channel is the positron - electron pair annihilation , which can occur at any scattering energy . in this process",
    "the positron collides with one of the target s electrons and annihilates into 2 or 3 gamma rays .",
    "theoretical @xcite and experimental studies @xcite of the annihilation process have shown that its cross section is up to 10@xmath1 times smaller than the elastic - scattering cross section",
    ". therefore the annihilation channel is often omitted from scattering calculations . the elastic scattering , excitation , ps formation and ionisation are the dominant channels of primary interest .",
    "the first theoretical studies of positron scattering from atoms date back to the 1950s , when @xcite used the first born approximation ( fba ) to describe ps - formation in e@xmath2-h collisions .",
    "the born method is based on the assumption that the wavefunction for the scattering system can be expanded in a rapidly convergent series .",
    "this approximation consists in using plane waves to describe the projectile and scattered particles .",
    "the born approximation is reliable when the scattering potential is relatively small compared to the incident energy , and thus is applicable only at high energies .",
    "therefore this method is mainly focused on high - energy excitation and ionization processes .",
    "one of the most successful methods applied to the low - energy e@xmath2-h elastic - scattering problem is the kohn variational method .",
    "the method was initially developed for scattering phase shifts in nuclear reactions by @xcite .",
    "later this method was extended to positron - hydrogen scattering by @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the method was given by @xcite .",
    "the method is based on finding the form of the functional ( called kohn functional ) involving the phaseshift as a parametric function of the total wavefunction . requiring the functional to be stationary with respect to the variations of the parameters , generates equations for the linear parameters .",
    "the phaseshifts can be accurately obtained by performing iterative calculations and finding the values of the nonlinear parameters that make the functional stationary .",
    "the many - body theory of @xcite utilizes techniques that originated from quantum field theory . using the feynman - diagram technique",
    "the perturbation series in the interaction between particles can be written in an intuitive way . when it is applied to positron - atom scattering , however , difficulties arise due to necessity to take into account ( virtual ) ps formation",
    ". however , a finite number of perturbation - theory terms can not describe a bound ps state .",
    "@xcite developed a sophisticated method based on the many - body perturbation theory .",
    "they used an approximation by considering virtual ps formation only in the ground state .",
    "the calculations with this method showed that for elastic scattering of positrons on hydrogen ( and helium atoms ) , the virtual ps - formation contribution was almost 30% and 20% of the total correlation potential , respectively . @xcite",
    "have further improved the method by introducing the techniques for the exact summation of the electron - positron ladder diagram series .",
    "the method was applied to @xmath3 scattering below the ps - formation threshold , and resulted in good agreement with accurate variational calculations .",
    "the momentum - space coupled - channel optical ( cco ) potential method was first developed for electron - atom scattering in the 1980s by @xcite .",
    "the method relies on constructing a complex equivalent local potential to account for the ionization and the ps - formation channels .",
    "the cco method gave excellent ionization @xcite , total and ps formation @xcite cross sections for positron scattering on hydrogen .",
    "@xcite used the cco method to study excitation of atomic hydrogen from the metastable 2s state .",
    "following @xcite @xcite developed the so - called two - center two - channel eikonal final state - continuum initial distorted - wave model to calculate ps formation in the ground and the lowest excited states .",
    "they also presented a @xmath4 scaling law for formation of ps(@xmath5 ) cross sections on the entire energy range with @xmath6 varying as a function of the positron incident energy .",
    "a hyperspherical hidden crossing ( hhc ) method has been applied to positron - impact ionization of hydrogen near the threshold by @xcite .",
    "they have calculated the ionization cross - section for s , p and d - waves .",
    "the hhc has also been used to calculate partial - wave ps(1@xmath6)-formation cross sections for low - energy positron collisions with h , li and na atoms @xcite .",
    "one of the most sophisticated and commonly used methods is the close - coupling ( cc ) formalism , which is based on the expansion of the total wavefunction using the target - state wavefunctions .",
    "substitution of this expansion into the schrdinger equation yields coupled differential equations in coordinate space , or lippmann - schwinger integral equations for the t - matrix in momentum space . by solving these equations",
    "the transition amplitudes are obtained for all open channels .",
    "considerable pioneering work in this field has been done by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , who demonstrated the success of using two - centre expansions consisting of ps and atomic states .    here and below",
    "when we discuss close - coupling calculations we denote the combined two - centre basis , used to expand the total scattering wavefunction , as ( @xmath7 ) , where @xmath8 is the number of atomic ( negative - energy ) eigenstates and @xmath9 is the number of positronium eigenstates .",
    "we also use a bar to indicate ( negative- and positive - energy ) pseudostates .",
    "for instance , cc(@xmath10 ) refers to close - coupling calculations with a combined basis made of @xmath8 pseudostates for the atomic centre supplemented by @xmath9 ps eigenstates .",
    "@xcite performed the first accurate two - state cc(1,1 ) calculation .",
    "this work known as the static - exchange approximation showed a giant spurious resonance near 40  ev incident positron energy .",
    "absence of such a resonance was demonstrated by @xcite using a larger cc(@xmath11 ) calculation that included @xmath6 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13-type pseudostates for both centres .",
    "however , the cc(@xmath11 ) gave new spurious resonances above the ionization threshold .",
    "an energy - averaging procedure was used to get smooth results for the cross sections to get rid of the pseudoresonances .",
    "considerable progress in the description of e@xmath2-h has been made by @xcite by using the close - coupling approach .",
    "@xcite have performed convergence studies for the full positron - hydrogen problem at low energies . below the ionization threshold they showed good agreement of sufficiently large pseudostate close - coupling calculations and the benchmark variational calculations of ps formation by @xcite .",
    "the convergent close - coupling ( ccc ) method was first developed for e@xmath14-h scattering by @xcite .",
    "its modification to positron scattering in a one - centre approach was trivial in that electron exchange was dropped and the interaction potentials changed sign  @xcite .",
    "the ccc method with a ( @xmath15 ) basis , i.e. a single atomic - centre expansion without any ps states , gave very good results for the total , elastic , excitation and ionization cross sections at higher incident energies where the ps - formation cross section is small allowing for distinction between two experimental data sets  @xcite .",
    "the ccc calculations showed no pseudoresonances so long as a sufficiently large basis was taken .",
    "following the success of the large single - centre ccc calculations , @xcite and @xcite used a large basis for the atomic centre supplemented by a few eigenstates of ps .",
    "calculations with the ( @xmath16 ) and ( @xmath17 ) bases , made of a large atomic basis similar to that of @xcite and the three lowest - lying eigenstates of ps , gave results significantly better than those from the ( @xmath11 ) basis  @xcite .",
    "the ccc method with a ( @xmath18 ) basis was developed by @xcite to study convergence in two - centre expansions .",
    "this was applied to positron scattering on hydrogen within the s - wave model retaining only @xmath6-states in the combined basis .",
    "this work for the first time demonstrated the convergence of the ( non - orthogonal ) two - centre expansions .",
    "the convergence in all channels was only possible when two independent near - complete laguerre bases are employed on both of the centres .",
    "interestingly , the total ionisation cross section had two independently converged components .",
    "one component was coming from the atomic centre and represented direct ionisation of the hydrogen atom , the other came from the ps centre and represented ps formation in the continuum .",
    "the convergence in the case of the full positron - hydrogen scattering problem was demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "the ccc calculations with such a combined two - centre basis have shown very good agreement with the experimental measurements of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations of positron scattering from helium has an additional challenge due to the complexity of the target structure . in multi - electron targets two - electron excitation ( or ionization with excitation ) channels are usually excluded .",
    "this is a good approximation as the contribution of these channels is typically two orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding one - electron excitation processes  @xcite",
    ".    first calculations of e@xmath2-he scattering have been performed by @xcite in the fba .",
    "they used only the ground states for he and ps and obtained cross sections for elastic scattering and ps formation in its ground state .",
    "their study highlighted the importance of the ps - channel coupling with the elastic channel and thereby motivated further studies .",
    "another extensive study based on the born approximation was presented by @xcite , to estimate ps - formation cross section in arbitrary s - states . from the fba studies it became clear that more sophisticated approaches to the problem were required .    the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) results are obtained by using distorted wavefunctions in first - order calculations .",
    "this method can give more accurate results than the fba down to lower energies .",
    "studies utilizing the dwba by @xcite were applied to the helium @xmath19 and @xmath20 excitations by positrons in the energy range from near the threshold up to 150  ev . although the agreement with the experimental data was not very satisfactory , the method indicated the importance of the inclusion of the polarization potential in the excitation channels at low energies .",
    "the most systematic study of the ionisation process within the framework of dwba was carried out by @xcite .",
    "they used coulomb and plane waves and also included exchange effects .",
    "they obtained good agreement with the experimental results of @xcite and @xcite over the energy range from near - threshold to 500  ev .",
    "however , the most important and difficult channel , ps formation , was not included in the early dwba studies .",
    "@xcite calculated the differential and total cross sections for the excitation of the helium @xmath21 state using the second - order dwba method .",
    "another dwba method including ps channels has been reported by @xcite for intermediate to high scattering energies .",
    "they have calculated ps - formation cross section and achieved good agreement with available experimental data above 60  ev . however , their results were not accurate for ps formation below 60  ev .",
    "considering the fact that ps formation starts at 17.8  ev and reaches its maximum around 40 ev , the applicability of this method is quite limited .",
    "@xcite applied the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , based on many - body theory @xcite , to positron - helium scattering at low energies . by using an approximate account of virtual ps formation they obtained good agreement with the elastic - scattering experimental data of @xcite and @xcite at the lowest energies .",
    "a similar rpa method was used by @xcite to calculate positron impact excitation of he into 2@xmath22s and 2@xmath22p states . as mentioned above",
    ", @xcite developed a more sophisticated method based on the many - body perturbation theory .",
    "the calculations with this method showed that the contribution from virtual ps formation was significant .",
    "applications of the method to various atomic targets were reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the kohn variational method was first applied to positron - helium collisions by humberston et al .",
    "a comprehensive study of positron - helium scattering with the kohn variational method was given by @xcite .",
    "they obtained very accurate cross sections at low energies .",
    "however , agreement with the experimental results of @xcite and @xcite for ps - formation cross section was qualitative , with a similar energy dependence but with almost 25% difference in magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , very good agreement was obtained for the total cross section below the ps - formation threshold .",
    "the cco method , mentioned earlier , was applied to positron scattering on helium by @xcite .",
    "they calculated the total and ps - formation cross sections from the ps - formation threshold to 500  ev .",
    "the calculated results agreed well with the corresponding experimental data except for the data of @xcite for the total cross section in the energy range from 50 to 100  ev .",
    "@xcite applied a polarized - orbital approximation method to low - energy elastic positron - helium scattering and obtained good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "other calculations using optical potentials were presented by @xcite and by @xcite for slow - positron scattering from helium .",
    "elastic - scattering cross sections of both reports were in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "in general , the optical - potential methods proved to be useful for calculations of total cross sections .",
    "they are problematic , however , when applied to more detailed cross sections like target excitation and ps formation in excited states .",
    "@xcite utilized the classical - trajectory monte - carlo ( ctmc ) technique to model positron scattering .",
    "the method is described fully for ion - atom collisions by @xcite and by @xcite . using this technique , @xcite calculated differential ionization cross section for positron - helium and also positron - krypton collisions .",
    "the main advantage of this method is that it can describe dynamic effects occurring in collisions .",
    "for instance , the ctmc calculations showed that the probability of positron scattering to large angles after ionising the target , may be comparable , or even much greater than , the probability of positronium formation .",
    "they suggested that the disagreement between theory and experiment above 60  ev might be resolved by accounting for the flux in the experiments measuring positronium formation due to positrons scattered to angles that allow them to escape confinement .",
    "@xcite also applied the ctmc method to helium ionization by positron impact .",
    "they obtained good agreement with experimental data of @xcite .",
    "results of ctmc reported by @xcite overestimate the recent experimental data by @xcite for the ps - formation cross section below 60  ev .",
    "this questions the applicability of the classical trajectory approach to positron scattering at low and intermediate energies .",
    "a very comprehensive study of positron - helium scattering using the close - coupling method was carried out by @xcite .",
    "they used two kinds of expansions , the first one consisting of 24 helium eigen- and pseudostates and the lowest three ps eigenstates , and the second one with only 30 helium eigen- and pseudo - states .",
    "the helium - target structure was modeled using a frozen - core approximation , which can produce good excited states , but a less accurate ground state .",
    "the atomic pseudostates were constructed using a slater basis . for the 27-state approximation ,",
    "only results in the energy range above the positronium - formation threshold were given .",
    "results for lower energies were unsatisfactory , and it was suggested that this might be due to the lack of convergence from the use of an inaccurate helium ground - state wavefunction .",
    "the total cross sections from both the 27- and 30-state approaches agreed well with the experimental results of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the energy range above the threshold of positronium formation .",
    "for lower energies , qualitative agreement was obtained in terms of the shape and the reproduction of the ramsauer - townsend minimum near 2 ev , while the theoretical results were a factor of 2 larger than the experimental data .",
    "the ps - formation cross section from the 27-state approximation was in good agreement with the experimental data of @xcite up to about 60  ev and with the data of @xcite and @xcite up to 90  ev .",
    "above 100  ev the calculations were much lower than the experimental data of @xcite and @xcite while being closer to the data of @xcite .",
    "another close - coupling calculation by @xcite , using a few helium and positronium states with a one - electron description of the helium atom , showed less satisfactory agreement with the experimental data .",
    "chaudhuri and adhikari @xcite performed calculations using only 5 helium and 3 positronium states in the expansion .",
    "their results for ps formation agreed well with the experimental results by @xcite at energies near the ps threshold and displayed a better agreement with the data of @xcite at the higher energies .",
    "however , the theoretical results were much lower than the experimental data at energies near the maximum of the cross section .",
    "@xcite applied the hyper - spherical cc approach to the problem .",
    "however , they also considered helium as a one - electron target , and thus the excitation and ps - formation cross sections were multiplied by factor of 2 .",
    "satisfactory results were obtained for the total ps - formation and he(2@xmath22s ) and he(2@xmath22p ) excitation cross sections .",
    "the method was not able to describe low - energy scattering mainly because a one - electron approach to helium is not realistic at low energies .    despite the obvious advantages of the above - mentioned close - coupling calculations in handling many scattering channels simultaneously , none was able to describe low - energy elastic scattering .",
    "in addition , the presence of pseudo - resonances in cross sections below the ionization threshold @xcite indicated that there was room for improvement .",
    "the use of the frozen - core he states also needed some attention as this yielded an inaccurate result for the ground state of helium .",
    "the first application of the single - centre ccc method to positron scattering on helium was made by @xcite , using very accurate helium wavefunctions obtained within the multi - core approximation .",
    "very accurate elastic cross section was obtained below the ps - formation threshold by using orbitals with very high angular momenta .",
    "it was suggested that the necessity for inclusion of very high angular - momentum orbitals was to mimic the virtual ps - formation processes .",
    "the method also gave accurate results for medium to high - energy scattering processes except that it was unable to explicitly yield the ps - formation cross section .",
    "interestingly , the method was not able to produce a converged result at the ore - gap region ( where only the elastic and ps - formation channels are open ) , which we shall discuss later in sec .",
    "[ intcont ] .",
    "comparison of the frozen - core and the multi - core results showed that the frozen - core wavefunctions lead to around 10% higher cross sections .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that single - centre expansions can give correct results below the ps - formation threshold and at high energies where the probability of ps formation is small , but for the full solution of the problem inclusion of the ps centre into expansions was required .",
    "the initial application of the two - centre ccc approach to the problem was within the frozen - core approximation  @xcite .",
    "it was then extended to a multi - core treatment  @xcite . while generally good agreement was found with experiment from low to high energies certain approximations made need to be highlighted .",
    "the key problematic channels are those of the type ps - he@xmath2 .",
    "electron exchange between ps and he@xmath2 is neglected .",
    "excitation of he@xmath2 is also neglected . while these may seem reasonable approximations for the helium target due to its very high ionisation threshold ( 24.6  ev for he and 54.4  ev for he@xmath2 ) , they become more problematic for quasi two - electron targets such as magnesium , discussed below .    positron scattering from the helium @xmath23 metastable state has been theoretically studied for the first time by @xcite at low and intermediate energies",
    ". converged results for the total , ps - formation and breakup cross sections have been obtained with a high degree of convergence .",
    "the obtained cross sections turned out to be significantly larger than those for scattering from the helium ground state .",
    "alkali atoms have an ionisation threshold that is lower than 6.8  ev .",
    "consequently , for positron scattering on alkalis the elastic and ps - formation channels are open at all incident - positron energies .",
    "for this reason , theory has to treat appropriately the `` competition '' for the valence electron between the two positively charged centers , the singly - charged ionic core and the positron .",
    "positron scattering on the lithium target was investigated by @xcite using a one - center expansion . however , convergence was poor due to the absence of ps - formation channels @xcite .",
    "two - center expansion was employed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . as expected , these approaches gave better agreement with the experiment .",
    "for positron - lithium case the two - center ccc approach to positron collisions with lithium was reported by @xcite .",
    "this is the most comprehensive study of the problem on an energy range spanning six orders of magnitude .",
    "while convergence was clearly established , and agreement with experiment for the total ps - formation cross section  @xcite is satisfactory , smaller experimental uncertainties would be helpful to provide a more stringent test of the theory .",
    "positron scattering from atomic sodium has been intensively studied for more than two decades .",
    "the first theoretical calculations relied on simple two - center decomposition of the system wavefunction with only the ground states of sodium and ps atoms taken into account @xcite .",
    "then , @xcite conducted more complex close - coupling calculations , adding several low - lying excited states for each positively - charged center .",
    "the obtained results turned out to be in reasonably good agreement with experimental data for both total @xcite and ps - formation @xcite cross sections .",
    "further enlargement of the number of channels in the close - coupling calculations revealed that the theoretical ps - formation cross sections @xcite deviated systematically from the experimental results for low impact energies .",
    "the experiment showed that the ps - formation cross section became larger with decreasing energy while the most refined theoretical calculations utilizing different methods of solution predicted consistently the opposite .    to resolve the discrepancy @xcite conducted the experimental study on ps formation in positron collisions with li and na atoms .",
    "this experiment confirmed the earlier results of @xcite .",
    "the authors managed to extend the impact - energy range down to 0.1 ev where the discrepancy between the theory and experiment was even larger for sodium . in striking contrast , for lithium the reasonable agreement of the measured cross section with the theoretical predictions was obtained with the use of the same methodology .",
    "@xcite applied the optical - potential approach .",
    "they found that their theoretical cross section increases with the decrease in the impact energies below 1  ev , but faster than the experimental results .",
    "unfortunately , this result was obtained with the use of some approximations , whose validity were not analyzed .",
    "it would be instructive if the same optical - potential approach was applied to the case of positron scattering on lithium .",
    "@xcite calculated ps - formation in positron - alkali collisions with the use of the hyper - spherical close - coupling method .",
    "their results support the previous theoretical data @xcite .",
    "large two - center ccc calculations of positron scattering by atomic sodium were reported by @xcite . despite being the most comprehensive to date",
    "there was no resolution of the discrepancy with experiment for ps formation at low energies , which we will highlight in sec  [ alkali - results ] .",
    "while the lighter alkali atoms are well - modeled by a frozen - core hartree - fock approximation , or even an equivalent local core potential , the heavier ones become more problematic . with a reduced ionisation threshold positron interaction with the core electrons , either directly or via exchange of the valence and the core electrons , becomes a more important component of the interaction . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this has not been addressed to a demonstrable level of convergence by any theory . nevertheless , assuming that such problems are more likely to be a problem at the higher energies , @xcite considered threshold behaviour of the elastic and ps - cross sections , and their convergence properties at near - zero energies for li , na and k. this work confirmed the expected threshold law proposed by @xcite , but was unable to resolve the discrepancy with the positron - sodium experiment at low energies .",
    "some earlier studies by @xcite and @xcite at low to intermediate energies were performed at a time when convergence was computationally impossible to establish .",
    "@xcite further developed the cco method to study positron scattering on rubidium at intermediate and high energies .",
    "they calculated the ps - formation and total cross sections .",
    "their total cross section results appear to overestimate the experiment .    though outside the scope of this review we note that the complex scaling method was recently used to study resonance phenomena in positron scattering on sodium  @xcite and potassium  @xcite .",
    "magnesium can be thought of as a quasi two - electron target with the core electrons being treated by the self - consistent field hartree - fock approach .",
    "positron scattering on magnesium is particularly interesting due to a large resonance in elastic scattering identified at low energies by @xcite .",
    "this was confirmed , though at a slightly different energy , by the one - centre calculations of @xcite which were able to be taken to convergence in the energy region where only elastic scattering was possible .",
    "minor structure differences are likely to be responsible for the small variation in the position of the resonance .",
    "two - centre ccc calculations  @xcite also reproduced the resonance , but had to make substantial approximations when treating the ps - mg@xmath2 interaction .",
    "this is even more problematic than in the case of helium discussed above since now we have a multi - electron hartree - fock core .",
    "agreement with experiment is somewhat variable , but there are substantial experimental uncertainties , particularly in the ps - formation cross section . other theoretical studies of positron - magnesium scattering include those by @xcite .",
    "inert gases heavier than helium represent a particular challenge for theory , which is unfortunate because they are readily accessible experimentally  @xcite .",
    "just the target structure is quite complicated , but some good progress has been made in the case of electron scattering by @xcite .",
    "for positron scattering once ps forms , the residual ion is of the open - shell type making full electron exchange incorporation particularly problematic .",
    "the relatively high ionisation thresholds for such targets mean that there is always a substantial ore gap where the ps - formation cross section may be quite large , but unable to be obtained in one - centre calculations which are constrained to have only elastic scattering as the open channel .",
    "nevertheless , outside the extended ore gap , formed by the ps - formation and the ionisation thresholds , one - centre ccc calculations can yield convergent results in good agreement with experiment  @xcite .",
    "there are also first - order perturbative calculations by @xcite and some based on close - coupling with convergence not fully established , see @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied positron scattering and annihilation on noble - gas atoms using many - body theory at energies below the ps - formation threshold .",
    "they demonstrated that at low energies , the many - body theory is capable of providing accurate results .",
    "@xcite used an impulse approximation to describe ps scattering on inert gases and provided quantitative theoretical explanation for the experimentally - observed similarity between the ps and electron scattering for equal projectile velocities @xcite . according to @xcite this happens due to the relatively weak binding and diffuse nature of ps , and the fact that electrons scatter more strongly than positrons off atomic targets .",

    "there are two computational problems that need to be overcome .",

    "electron exchange is handled within the potential matrix elements all based on the coordinate origin at the nucleus .",
    "accordingly , establishing convergence in just the one - centre approach is all that needs to be done , though historically this was a major challenge  @xcite .",
    "though convergence was shown to be to a result that disagreed with experiment  @xcite , subsequent experiments showed excellent agreement with the ccc theory  @xcite , which lead to reanalysis of the original data  @xcite yielding good agreement with the ccc theory and new experiments .",
    "a similar situation occurred in the case of double photoionisation of helium  @xcite , which in effect is electron scattering on the singly charged helium ion  @xcite .    for positron and proton scattering",
    "the issue of convergence is even more interesting due to the capacity of the projectile to form a bound state with a target electron .",

    "the ps - formation threshold is at 6.8  ev , while the ionisation threshold is 13.6  ev .",

    "we mean that the same results must be obtained from a variety of calculations utilising independent one- and two - centre expansions as detailed below .",

    "<S> much progress in the theory of positron scattering on atoms has been made in the ten years since the review of  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we review this progress for few - electron targets with a particular emphasis on the two - centre convergent close - coupling and other theories which explicitly treat positronium ( ps ) formation . </S>",
    "<S> while substantial progress has been made for ps formation in positron scattering on few - electron targets , considerable theoretical development is still required for multielectron atomic and molecular targets . </S>"
