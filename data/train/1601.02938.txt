    "exploring the properties of compressed baryonic matter , or , more generally , strongly interacting matter at high densities and/or temperatures , has become a forefront area of modern physics .",
    "experimentally , the properties of such matter are being probed with the relativistic heavy ion collider rhic at brookhaven and the large hadron collider lhc at cern .",
    "great advances in our understanding of such matter are also expected from the next generation of heavy - ion collision experiments at fair ( facility for antiproton and ion research at gsi ) and nica ( nucloton - based ion collider facility at jinr ) @xcite as well as from the study of neutron stars ( for an overview , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "neutron stars ( nss ) contain nuclear matter compressed to densities which are several times higher than the densities of atomic nuclei . at such extreme conditions",
    ", the fundamental building blocks of matter may no longer be just neutrons and protons immersed in a gas of relativistic electron and muons , but other nuclear degrees of freedom such as hyperons , delta particles and , most intriguingly , deconfined up , down and strange quarks may begin to play a role .",
    "neutron stars containing deconfined quark matter in their central core are referred to as quark - hybrid stars ( hybrid stars , for short ) .",
    "the most massive neutron stars observed to date are @xmath1 ( @xmath2 )  @xcite and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 )  @xcite .",
    "in several recent papers @xcite , it has been shown that they may contain significant fractions of quark - hybrid matter in their centers , despite the relatively stiff nuclear equation of state ( eos ) that is required to achieve such high masses .",
    "the radii of these neutron stars would be between 13 and 14  km , depending on the nuclear eos @xcite , increasing to respectively 13.5 and 14.5  km for lighter neutron stars with canonical masses of around @xmath0 .",
    "such radius values lie between the radius determinations based on x - ray burst oscillations of neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries @xcite and the estimates of the radius of the isolated neutron star rx j1856 - 3754 @xcite , emitting purely thermal radiation in the x - ray and in the optical bands .",
    "if the dense interior of a neutron star contains deconfined quark matter , it will most likely be three - flavor quark matter , since such matter has lower energy than two - flavor quark matter @xcite . furthermore , just as for the hyperon content of neutron stars ,",
    "strangeness is not conserved on macroscopic time scales which allows neutron stars to convert confined hadronic matter to three - flavor quark matter until equilibrium brings this process to a halt .",
    "we considered the transition from hadronic to quark matter to be first order .",
    "there are two distinct ways to construct a first order phase transition in neutron stars .",
    "the first option is a gibbs construction , where the electronic and baryonic chemical potentials as well as the pressure are continuous during the phase transition ; the second option is a maxwell construction , where only the baryonic chemical potential and pressure are continuous and the electronic chemical potential is characterized by a discontinuity at the phase boundary .",
    "the surface tension at the interface between the quark - hadron phase is what determines whether a gibbs or maxwell phase transition may be taking place .",
    "several authors @xcite have attempted to estimate the value of the surface tension , with mixed results . for what follows",
    ", we will assume that the surface tension is less than 40  mev  @xmath5 , such that the gibbs condition is favored and a mixed phase of quark matter and nuclear matter exists above a certain density @xcite .    in the mixed phase",
    ", the presence of quarks allows the hadronic component to become more isospin symmetric , which is accomplished by the transference of electric charge to the quark phase .",
    "thus , the symmetry energy can be lowered at only a small cost in rearranging the quark fermi surfaces .",
    "the implication of this charge rearrangement is that the mixed phase region of a neutron star will have positively charged hadronic matter and negatively charged quark matter  @xcite .",
    "this should have important implications for the electric and thermal properties of nss .",
    "studies of the transport properties of quark - hybrid neutron star matter have been reported in  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned above , this study is carried out for neutron stars containing deconfined quark matter in their centers ( so - called quark - hybrid stars ) .",
    "to describe the quark matter phase , we use a non - local extension of the su(3 ) nambu jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite with vector interactions . for the hadronic phase we consider a non - linear relativistic mean - field model @xcite solved for two different parametrizations , gm1  @xcite and nl3  @xcite . the transition from the confined hadronic phase to the deconfined quark phase",
    "is treated as a gibbs transition , imposing global electric charge neutrality and baryon number conservation on the field equations .",

    "all high - mass stars contain extended quark - hybrid matter cores in their centers , but a pure quark matter is never reached for any of our model parametrizations .",
    "the maximum neutron star masses drop if the strength of the vector repulsion among quarks is reduced , falling below the @xmath140 limit set by pulsars @xmath1 ( @xmath141 )  @xcite and @xmath3 ( @xmath142 )  @xcite for some parameter combinations .",
    "examples of this are neutron stars computed for the gm1 parametrization with @xmath136 , which yields a maximum - mass neutron star of @xmath143 , in conflict with the recent mass determinations mentioned just above .",
    "the quark - hybrid stars of our study possess relatively high proton fractions in their cores so that fast neutrino processes , most notably the direct urca process , is active , leading to very rapid stellar cooling .",
    "an agreement with the thermal evolution data of the neutron star in cas a can be obtained , however , if one assumes that strong proton - pairing is occurring in the core of this neutron star , which is known to strongly suppress fast cooling . under this condition , a @xmath0 neutron star computed for the nl3 model and values of the vector coupling constants between @xmath136 and @xmath144 lead to excellent agreement with the observed data .",
    "it is important to note that the proton pairing model has not been fine tuned to the cas a data .",
    "further studies where we also take into account pairing among the quarks will be presented in a future work .",
    "we have also compared the thermal behavior predicted for cas a with that of other compact stars .",
    "in contrast to cas a , however , these observations only temperature `` snapshots '' exist for the latter , with age estimates based on either their kinematic or spin - down properties .",
    "the results show that the njl models that are in agreement with cas a ( i.e. , @xmath136 and @xmath137 with deep proton pairing ) lead to good agreement with the observed data of several other compact objets , while failing to reproduce seveal other data .",
    "this , however , is not an inherent feature of our model but , rather , appears symptomatic for most thermal models that agree with the cas a data @xcite .",
