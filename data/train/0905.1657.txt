    "jets are often used in numerical , experimental and theoretical studies for modelling of mixing in various engineering applications ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "different kinds of structures are formed during mixing in turbulent jets ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most significant results is a detection of a sharp increase of mixing rates caused by the onset of small - scale turbulence within large - scale coherent motions @xcite .",
    "this effect that was studied experimentally and numerically , demonstrates complex nonlinear dynamics of mixing ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . however , it is not clear how such mixing states are attained , and the ambiguity is exacerbated by the differences in experimental results .",
    "the possible reason for such variety of experimental results is the difference in schmidt number between gases and liquids .",
    "it was found in @xcite that mixing becomes more effective in a liquid jet for the larger reynolds numbers .",
    "however , the dependence of the normalized scalar variance on reynolds number for the gaseous jet is very weak .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that this difference is caused by the schmidt number effect . in particular , when schmidt number sc @xmath0 the larger molecular species diffusivity results in better mixing of the scalar field even at lower reynolds numbers . here",
    "sc@xmath1 is the schmidt number , @xmath2 is the coefficient of brownian ( molecular ) diffusion and @xmath3 is the kinematic viscosity . for the liquid jets , sc @xmath4 , the improved mixing requires the enhancement in the interfacial surface - to - volume ratio ( smaller distances between iso - scalar surfaces ) associated with higher reynolds numbers . due to",
    "the large differences in schmidt numbers the results of these studies in liquids are not directly applicable to the case of gaseous shear - layer mixing .    in the present study",
    "we investigate experimentally mixing at the air jet interface using the incense smoke that is characterized by significantly larger schmidt number ( sc@xmath5 than that employed in the previous studies of gas flow mixing .",
    "the high magnitude of schmidt number prevents from fast molecular diffusion to affect mixing .",
    "we study mixing at the external boundary of a submerged turbulent jet using particle image velocimetry ( piv ) and an image processing technique based on the analysis of the intensity of the mie scattering in order to determine the spatial distribution of the jet fluid ( with a high concentration of the tracer particles ) and of the ambient fluid ( with a low concentration of the tracer particles ) . in this flow",
    "there is no a sharp interface between the jet and ambient air .    in the data analysis",
    "we use two approaches , whereby one approach is similar to that used previously in the analysis of rayleigh - taylor instability ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this approach is based on the measured phase function for the study of the mixed state of two fluids .",
    "the other approach used in our study is based on the analysis of the two - point second - order correlation function of the particle number density fluctuations generated by tangling of the gradient of the mean particle number density by the turbulent velocity field ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this gradient is formed at the external boundary of a submerged turbulent jet .",
    "both approaches demonstrate that probability density function ( pdf ) of the phase function of a jet fluid penetrating into an external flow and the two - point second - order correlation function of the particle number density do not have universal scaling and can not be fitted by a power - law function .",
    "there is a qualitative agreement between theoretical and experimental results obtained in our study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we describe the experimental set - up for a laboratory study of mixing at the external boundary of a submerged turbulent jet . in sect .",
    "iii we discuss the experimental results and their detailed analysis by means of the approach based on the measured phase function . in sect .",
    "iv we perform a theoretical study of mixing at the external boundary of a submerged turbulent jet based on the analysis of the two - point second - order correlation function of the particle number density . in sect .",
    "iv we also compare the theoretical predictions with the obtained experimental results for the correlation function of the particle number density .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "v. in appendix we perform an asymptotic analysis of the solution of equation for the two - point second - order correlation function .",

    "[ fig1 ] includes the chamber with the transparent plexiglass walls ( 1 ) , and the cylindrical tube ( 2 ) with a jet nozzle mounted at the tip . a submerged air jet ( 3 ) discharges into the chamber .",
    "the cross - section of the channel with transparent walls is @xmath6 @xmath7 , a diameter of the jet nozzle is @xmath8 mm and the diameter of the jet in the probed region is about 35 mm .",
    "consequently , the side walls of the channel weakly affect the development of the jet .",

    "an estimate of the mean response time of these particles @xmath14 to a step change of the velocity is of the order of @xmath15 s. since the latter value is much smaller than the kolmogorov time @xmath16 of the flow in the jet ( @xmath16 varies in the rage from @xmath17 s to @xmath18 s ) , and smoke particles stokes number st@xmath19 , it can be safely assumed that these particle follow the flow faithfully .",
