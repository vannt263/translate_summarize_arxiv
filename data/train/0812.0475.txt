    "over the last few decades nonstationary processes in cavities have received considerable attention .",
    "one such process is the nonstationary or dynamical casimir effect ( dce )  in particular , the creation of photons from vacuum , or another initial field state , in cavity whose geometry pra50 - 1027,pra50 - 1027a , pra50 - 1027b , law , law1 or material properties law , law1,jj , jj1,jj2,jj3 have a periodic time dependence , with the modulation frequency close to twice the unperturbed field eigenfrequency .",
    "nowadays , dce in cavities is a well studied problem , with a variety of theoretical predictions concerning the number and the statistics of created photons , as well as the influence of detuning , dissipation , boundary conditions , geometry and nonperiodicity of the modulation ( see jpb - s , book , jrlr26 - 445 for an extensive list of references ) . to date , dce has not been observed in laboratory , however several concrete proposals have appeared over the last years jpa39 - 6271,jpa39 - 6271a , onofrio , jpa39 - 6271b , d2,mme , with some of them being currently implemented experimentally @xcite .",
    "the interest in nonstationary processes in cavities reappeared over the last 5 years due to the progress in the field of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed @xcite ) in the condensed matter systems , e.g. semiconductor quantum dots n432 - 197,n432 - 200,faraon , faraon1,ima , ima1 , polar molecules np2 - 636,np2 - 636a and superconducting circuits n431 - 159,n431 - 162,prl96 - 127006 coupled to high-@xmath0 resonators , the latest architecture known as _ circuit _ qed @xcite . in cavity qed , the effective 2-level atom is coupled to the field inside the resonator via the dipole interaction , allowing for observation of the light - matter interaction at the level of single photons and single atoms .",
    "the new ingredient in the solid state cavity qed , in particular circuit qed , is the possibility of engineering and manipulating the properties of the artificial 2-level atom and the resonator @xcite , as well as the interaction strength between them @xcite , either during the fabrication , or _ in situ_.    recently , the strong resonant and the strong dispersive coupling limits between the artificial atom and a single cavity mode were observed experimentally in circuit qed @xcite and other solid state architectures @xcite .",
    "moreover , the single photon source @xcite , single artificial - atom maser xx4 , multiphoton fock states @xcite and interaction between two artificial atoms ( qubits ) @xcite were implemented experimentally , among many other important achievements ( see @xcite for more references ) . besides , the circuit qed architecture benefits from robust readout schemes of the atomic and the resonator states pra69 - 062320,medv , r1,r1a , r1b , r2,pra75 - 032329 , relatively low dissipative losses @xcite , state preparation techniques @xcite and real time manipulation of the atomic transition frequency via electric and magnetic fields @xcite or nonresonant microwave fields n449 - 443,pra75 - 032329 .    harnessing the tunability of the atomic transition frequency ,",
    "the authors in @xcite proposed an experimental implementation of the landau - zener sweeps in circuit qed , when the atomic frequency increases linearly in time .",
    "this allows for generation of single photons , as well as cavity - atom entangled states . in a similar direction ,",
    "the generation of the quantum vacuum radiation by modulating periodically the vacuum rabi frequency of an intersubband transition in a doped quantum well system embedded in a planar microcavity was considered in @xcite , and emission of photon pairs was predicted for ` resonant ' modulation frequencies . a preliminary theoretical study of the feasibility of realizing the dynamical casimir effect with a quantum flux qubit in superconducting quantum nanocircuits , as well as the detection of the generated photons , was reported in @xcite . on the other hand , the freedom of controlling in real - time the atomic frequency",
    "is currently being explored to couple / decouple one or several qubits to / from the cavity mode in order to implement quantum logic operations @xcite .    in this paper , following the original proposal @xcite , we study nonstationary processes in the solid state cavity qed , where a single cavity mode is coupled to a single artificial atom whose transition frequency , or atom - cavity coupling , have a small periodic time modulation , prescribed externally . such a control over the transition frequency , with compatible modulation frequency , can be achieved in circuit qed with present or near - future technology @xcite .",
    "we show that in the dispersive atom - cavity regime and under the resonance conditions one obtains completely different effective regimes of the atom - field interaction , which can be approximately described by the resonant anti - jaynes - cummings ( ajc ) , resonant jaynes - cummings ( jc ) or the dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) hamiltonians .",
    "moreover , in the resonant atom - cavity regime , the system dynamics resembles the behavior of the dce in the vibrating cavity containing a resonant two - level atom , and entangled states with at most two photons can be generated from vacuum .",
    "we also consider the case , in which the atomic frequency , the atom - cavity coupling parameter , or both have a small nonperiodic time modulation , prescribed externally .",

    "we deduce an effective hamiltonian in the dispersive regime , and show that photon generation from vacuum is possible for fine tuned modulation frequencies .",

    "we show the mean number of created photons @xmath66 and the population inversion @xmath250 as function of dimensionless time @xmath251 for @xmath246 and @xmath252 , calculated numerically for the initial hamiltonian ( [ rabi ] ) and the effective hamiltonian ( [ plus ] ) using the parameters @xmath253 , @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "one can see that the effective hamiltonian @xmath256 describes well the exact dynamics , and there is a quasi - periodic generation of a few photons , together with the atomic excitation .",
    "qualitatively , this occurs because for initial times the hamiltonian ( [ plus ] ) becomes @xmath257 and the photons are generated from vacuum quadratically in time .",
    "however , after @xmath258 photons have been created , the exponent multiplying @xmath259 in ( [ plus ] ) becomes large , so the photon creation process goes out of resonance and it is interrupted .",
    "obtained numerically for the exact [ equation ( [ rabi ] ) ] and effective [ equation ( plus ) ] hamiltonians for the resonance shift @xmath260 [ equation ( [ tildz ] ) ] .",
    "the effective @xmath66 shows slow oscillations , while the exact one does not . ]    to create a large number of photons from vacuum , we can adopt an ` active ' approach , by which the resonance shift @xmath70 is adjusted _ adiabatically _ as function of time , so the effective hamiltonian ( [ geral ] ) is valid . in this way , we continuously adjust the resonance shift to the number of photons in the cavity , provided we choose an appropriate functional form of @xmath49 . in figure [ fig6 ]",
    "we show the mean number of created photons @xmath66 from the initial state @xmath1 for the rabi hamiltonian ( [ rabi ] ) and the effective hamiltonian ( [ plus ] ) , using the parameters @xmath261 , @xmath254 , @xmath262 and setting @xmath263one can see that a significant amount of photons can be generated from vacuum , provided the resonance shift is adjusted adiabatically , and the effective hamiltonian @xmath256 describes well the exact dynamics .",
    "finally , notice that these results also hold if , instead of the coupling parameter @xmath264 , one modulates the atomic transition frequency @xmath216 , or both @xmath264 and @xmath216 simultaneously , one with frequency @xmath265 , and another with @xmath153 .",
    "in conclusion , we studied the nonstationary solid state cavity qed system in which the atomic transition frequency or the atom - cavity coupling have a small periodic time modulation , prescribed externally .",
    "we showed that in the dispersive regime and under the resonant modulations , the rabi hamiltonian ( which describes the system dynamics ) can be significantly simplified , resulting in three different regimes that can be described by the anti - jaynes - cummings , jaynes - cummings or the dynamical casimir effect hamiltonians .",
    "moreover , in the resonant atom - cavity regime , entangled states with two photons can be created from the vacuum state @xmath1 under the corresponding resonance , analogously to the dynamical casimir effect in a vibrating cavity containing a resonant two - level atom .",
    "we also showed that the photon generation from vacuum occurs for a small nonperiodic time modulation of the atom - cavity coupling , the atomic transition frequency , or both in circuit qed .",
    "we deduced an effective hamiltonian for the bichromatic modulation in the dispersive regime , and demonstrated that it describes well the exact dynamics .",
    "numerical simulations confirmed that several photons can be generated from vacuum provided the modulation frequencies are fine tuned adiabatically .",
    "this study illustrates the importance of the anti - rotating terms in the rabi hamiltonian , ignored in the jaynes - cummings model  here this term is responsible for photon generation from vacuum and field amplification .",
    "moreover , one could engineer effective interactions in nonstationary circuit qed by means of modulating the system parameters . as applications",
    ", this scheme can be used to verify photon creation from vacuum in nonstationary circuit qed due to an analog of the dynamical casimir effect using a single atom , as well as off - resonant population transfer between the states @xmath266 and generation of entangled states with several photons .",
