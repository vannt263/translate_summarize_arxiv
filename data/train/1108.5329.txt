    "the mle method is therefore consistent with our method and our work can be seen as a theoretical justification of it .",
    "we emphasize that in contrast to mle , our work shows how to compute reliable error bars .",
    "this implies in particular that most of the likely states ( i.e.  the states within the error bars ) are not on the boundary of the state space , even though the maximum might lie on the boundary .",
    "our method can therefore be seen as a resolution of the `` problem '' that the states predicted by mle are unphysical because they lie on the boundary .",
    "we now want to study the decay of @xmath25 around its maxima . in general this",
    "is not easy , as the maxima might lie on the boundary of the set .",
    "useful statements can be made however , when the maxima are in the interior of the set of states .",

    "the extreme points are characterised by the equations @xmath204 @xmath205 let us for simplicity restrict to the case , where the @xmath188 are linearly independent , then , since the @xmath188 form a povm , we have @xmath206 as a condition for an extreme point .",
    "in order to carry over these findings to the estimate density , we need to understand the behaviour of the normalisation constant @xmath207 .",

    "the decay exponent , @xmath212 , is therefore asymptotically equal to the relative entropy ( in units of the natural logarithm ) @xmath213 where @xmath214 ( this shows in particular that the extreme points are maxima since the relative entropy is nonnegative ) .",
    "inequality @xmath215 implies that the error bars around the maxima are therefore given by @xmath216 in the distance on the set of density matrices induced by the norm  @xcite @xmath217",
    "we remark that it is possible to adapt our method to the case where additional information , e.g. , about the rank of the state or its symmetry , is available , and thereby to establish confidence regions also in these situations .",
    "for example , if it is known that the state @xmath41 is invariant under local actions ( on the individual systems @xmath16 ) of unitaries from a given set @xmath218 , then the integral in   can be restricted to a subset @xmath219 of states @xmath75 on @xmath16 such that @xmath220 for any @xmath221 .",
    "accordingly , the confidence region is given by @xmath222 , provided the criterion of the corollary is satisfied .",
    "we also note that the output of the data analysis , @xmath25 , can be specified using a representation in terms of generalised spherical harmonics .",
    "data obtained from measurements on @xmath9 systems specify exactly the moments of degree less than @xmath9 of this representation . in particular , these moments contain all information that is needed for a later update of @xmath25 based on additional measurement data ( see appendices ) . while in the case of i.i.d .",
    "measurements ( with a finite number of outcomes ) this representation of the measurement data is costly ( @xmath223 bits ) when compared to simply storing the frequencies ( @xmath224 bits ) , it may be useful in the case of non - i.i.d .",
    "measurements or measurements with an unbounded ( or even continuous ) set of outcomes , since it does not depend on the number of outcomes .",

    "<S> hence , instead of estimating this state directly , we can equivalently consider the task of predicting the outcomes of the hypothetical tests .    </S>",
    "<S> assume now that we carry out a test @xmath40 depending on @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> we denote by @xmath41 the ( unknown ) joint state of the systems @xmath42 before the tomographic measurements . </S>",

    "<S> the proof of the theorem , together with a slightly more general formulation , is provided in the _ </S>",
    "<S> supplemental information_. it makes crucial use of the following fact , which has also been used in quantum - cryptographic security proofs : there exists a so - called _ de finetti state _ @xmath65 , i.e. , a convex combination of tensor products , such that @xmath66 holds for all permutation - invariant states @xmath67 on @xmath68  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> we consider the practically relevant case of an experiment that can _ in principle _ be repeated arbitrarily often . within the above - described general scenario , </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the limit where @xmath23 approaches infinity while @xmath9 , the number of actual runs of the experiment ( whose data is analyzed ) , is still finite and may be small .    </S>",
    "<S> since the initial state @xmath41 of all @xmath19 systems can without loss of generality be assumed to be permutation invariant ( see above ) , the quantum de finetti theorem  @xcite implies that , for fixed @xmath69 , the marginal state @xmath70 on @xmath71 systems is approximated by a mixture of product states , i.e. , @xmath72 for some probability density function @xmath73 and approximation error proportional to @xmath74 . in the limit of large @xmath23 , </S>",
    "<S> the marginal state @xmath70 is thus fully specified by @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore equivalently imagine that all systems were prepared in the same unknown `` true '' state @xmath75 , which is distributed according to @xmath73 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_iid ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the i.i.d .  </S>",
    "<S> assumption commonly made in the literature on quantum state tomography , which is therefore rigorously justified within our general setup .    as before </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that tomographic measurements are applied to the systems @xmath76 , whereas the remaining systems , @xmath77 , undergo a test ( depending on the output @xmath25 of the data analysis procedure ) . </S>",
    "<S> we may now consider tests that are passed if and only if the true state @xmath75 is contained in a given subset @xmath78 of the state space . </S>",
    "<S> the following corollary provides a sufficient criterion under which the tests are passed , so that @xmath78 are confidence regions . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that the criterion refers to additional sets @xmath79 that are related to the confidence regions @xmath78 ; see the _ supplemental information _ for an illustration . )    </S>",

    "<S> we refer to the _ supplemental information _ for the technical proof .    </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath89 can be interpreted as the _ confidence level _ of the statement that the true state @xmath75 is contained in the set @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , the claim is valid for all @xmath75 . in particular , it is independent of any initial probability distribution , @xmath73 , according to which @xmath75 may have been chosen ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq_iid ] ) . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the operational interpretation of the sets @xmath90 as confidence regions does not depend on any extra assumptions about the preparation procedure or on the specification of a prior . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath75 could even be chosen `` maliciously '' , for example in a quantum cryptographic context , where an adversary may try to pretend that a system has certain properties ( e.g. , that its state is entangled while in reality it is not ) .    </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the assertion that a state @xmath75 is contained in a certain set @xmath91 can only be considered a good approximation of @xmath75 if the set @xmath91 is small . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed the case for reasonable choices of the measurement @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the practically important case where each system is measured independently and identically with povm @xmath92 , the confidence region is , for generic states , asymptotically of size proportional to @xmath93 in the ( semi-)norm on the set of quantum states induced by the povm : @xmath94 ( see _ supplemental information _ and  @xcite ) .    _ </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion.|__despite conceptual differences , our technique is not unrelated to mle and bayesian estimation . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned before , @xmath95 is proportional to the likelihood function and , therefore , methods to construct confidence regions with our technique are likely to use adaptations of techniques from mle . also , @xmath33 corresponds to the probability measure obtained from applying bayes updating rule to the hilbert - schmidt measure ; a fact that implies near optimality  , which is usually exponentially decreasing in the size of the confidence region @xmath79 , is tight up to a polynomial factor . ] of our method in the practically most relevant case of independent tomographically complete measurements  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , another novel approach to quantum state tomography has been proposed  @xcite , which yields reliable error bounds similar to ours . </S>",
    "<S> a central difference between this approach and ours is the level of generality . in  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a specific sequence of measurement operations is proposed , which is adapted to systems whose states are fairly pure . under this condition , </S>",
    "<S> the estimate converges fast and , in addition , can be computed efficiently . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , our method can be applied to arbitrary measurements ( i.e. , any tomographic data may be analyzed ) . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the convergence of the confidence region depends on the choice of these measurements . </S>",
    "<S> however , we do not propose any specific algorithm for the efficient computation of confidence regions .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we refer to the very recent work of blume - kohout  @xcite for an excellent discussion of the notion of confidence regions in quantum state tomography . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , he shows that confidence regions , as considered here , can be defined via likelihood ratios .    _ </S>",
