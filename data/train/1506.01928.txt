    "the matrix @xmath38 is the transition probability of the markov chain defined by :    @xmath157    where @xmath158 it the probability distribution at time @xmath159 .",
    "if the trajectory is long enough , @xmath38 is ergodic and time invariant , vector @xmath160 coincides with the stationary distribution associated with the markov chain @xmath161 .",
    "morover , the detailed balance condition must hold :    @xmath162      once we have translated de molecular dynamics trajectories onto a cmn , we apply the stochastic steepest descent ( ssd ) algorithm @xcite in order to split it into its basins of attraction in an efficient way , obtaining in turn useful thermo - statistical information about the system.the ssd algorithm is inspired in the deterministic steepest descent algorithm used to find minima in a multidimensional surface .",
    "we define the assisting vector @xmath163 , where @xmath6 labels the nodes .",
    "the steps of the ssd algorithm are the following :    1 .",
    "we start with @xmath164 .",
    "2 .   select randomly a node @xmath165 with @xmath166 and write an auxiliary list of nodes adding @xmath165 as first entry .",
    "3 .   select within the neighbors of @xmath165 the node @xmath13 that follows the maximum probability flux , this is @xmath167 .",
    "check which of the following conditions is fulfilled : 1 .   if @xmath168 and @xmath169 , add @xmath13 to the list and go back to 3 . using @xmath13 instead of @xmath165 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath168 and @xmath170 write the labels of all the nodes in the list as @xmath171 . go back to step 3 . 3 .   if @xmath172 remove link @xmath173 from the graph .",
    "return to point 3 .",
    "this process ends when every node in the cmn has been labelled , this is @xmath174 .",
    "then , the whole conformational space has been characterized and every node is connected with its local minima in the fel . all nodes with the same label belong to the same basin in this fel and therefore we can associate them with the same conformational state .    given the basin partition , a new cmn network can be built , taken the basins themselves as new nodes .",
    "the occupation probabilities will now be defined as @xmath175 , while the new transition matrix @xmath38 is built , with elements @xmath176 . from these definitions ,",
    "transition times can be easily calculated as @xmath177 , being @xmath36 the time window used for the network construction .",
    "the relative free energy of basin @xmath178 with respect to basin @xmath3 is simply @xmath179 .",
    "we start by characterizing the protein from a thermal and mechanical point of view , in order to know the suitable range of force and temperature to work with .",
    "although more detailed characterizations have been made in previous works @xcite we focus on the thermodynamical transition at @xmath19 , reflected on a peak in the heat capacity , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "the heat capacity is calculated as @xmath180 $ ] , with @xmath181 the total internal energy .",
    "we work at @xmath21 , below the transition , but with allowing enough fluctuation for the system to explore its configurational space .",
    "it exhibits a thermodynamical unfolding transition , reflected in a peak on the heat capacity ( in arbitrary units ) .",
    "force also induces an unfolding transition at @xmath20 , leading to the fully stretched conformation.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    when applying force to the protein , it exhibits also a transition at @xmath20 , where the protein unfolds mechanically to the fully stretched configuration . at this force ,",
    "the end - to - end distance @xmath68 increases abruptly , while the fraction of native contacts @xmath0 drops to @xmath182 . around @xmath183",
    "a first change of behavior can be seen , due to the population of the half - stretched configuration , which leads to a drop to @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
