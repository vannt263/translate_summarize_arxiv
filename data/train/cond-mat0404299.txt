    "the characteristic feature of the modern stage in studying mesoscopic systems is a possibility to fix individual properties of investigated objects such as chemical composition , size geometric shape and particle number .",
    "the well known example of such investigations is the discovery of electronic shells in alkali metal clusters  @xcite .",
    "the other branch of researches is connected with recent advances in the development of new techniques for fabricating two- or three - dimensional micro- and nano - structures that enables current experiments to investigate variations of both the exact number of electrons on such mesoscopic structures and their geometrical shapes with a precise control in all dimensions .",
    "frequently experiments are produced so that investigated systems may exchange energy with surroundings ( they are embedded in heat reservoir ) , i.e. they are kept at an invariable temperature , however the exchange by particle is absent .",
    "thus , such systems constitute a canonical ensemble , and the most appropriate theoretical method for their statistical description is the canonical formalism .",
    "the papers of denton , mhlschlegel and scalapino  @xcite were the first where the canonical description was developed in applying to electrons in small metallic grains . at that time it was impossible to fix the shape and particle number of each grain .",
    "therefore for constructing the canonical partition function denton et al made the simplest assumption that the energy spectrum of free electrons in a metallic grain is equidistant ( the equal level spacing model ) and two - fold degenerated if there is no magnetic field . using reasonable approximations",
    "( @xmath5 , @xmath6 is number of single electron levels ) denton et al established an analytical expression for the canonical partition function .",
    "they showed that the main differences between the canonical and grand canonical values of the heat capacity ( @xmath7 ) and magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath8 ) lie at small temperatures @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the mean level spacing ) . besides they found that at @xmath11 the grand canonical heat capacity exceeds the canonical one by @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "the partition function of denton et al takes into account energy variations in an applied uniform magnetic field .",
    "they manifest themselves in oscillations of @xmath8 and @xmath7 with growth of the field .",
    "such oscillations are typical for charged particle systems  @xcite however the strong periodicity in the oscillations is a feature of the equal level spacing .",
    "it is worthwhile emphasizing the @xmath0-independence of thermodynamic quantities as functions of @xmath14 in the canonical calculations of denton et al at @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "it is caused by a relatively narrow layer of single particle levels near the fermi energy , which mainly contributes to the partition function , and by the identical for any @xmath0 structure of the single - particle energy spectrum in this layer .",
    "the canonical formalism was also used by brack , genzken and hansen  @xcite for calculations of thermal properties of the valence electrons in alkali metal clusters . in this case",
    "free electron energy spectra contain considerable gaps that accounts for enhanced stability of clusters with the magic numbers of atoms .",
    "brack et al showed that the shell structure reveals itself in the theoretical heat capacity .",
    "however , the difference between the canonical and grand canonical shell effects is quite noticeable only at temperatures which are less than or of the same order as the mean level spacing @xmath17 near the fermi .",
    "thus , both investigations ,  @xcite , point out the region of the temperatures , @xmath18 , where the comparison of the canonical and grand canonical calculations is of the most interest . besides",
    ", in the center of attention should be magic electron numbers ( if they appear in the system ) since the existence of such @xmath0 is a consequence of the appearance of an energy gap near the fermi level that enhances the difference between canonical and grand canonical results .",
    "it is well known that @xmath18 is the best regime for observing size effects in mesoscopic systems  @xcite .",
    "therefore the canonical approach at these temperatures can give more precise theoretical information than the grand canonical calculations .    in order to calculate the partition function @xmath19 , occupation numbers , internal energy and other thermodynamic quantities brack et al used recurrence relations connecting @xmath19 with those for smaller @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "following this procedure they found that @xmath20 calculation steps were needed to obtain the final result , i.e. for @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "such method is still manageable for @xmath0 up to a few hundreds , however it could be hardly applied to @xmath0 and @xmath23 .",
    "thus the constructing of the effectively working canonical formalism without restrictions on the particle number and applicable to arbitrary spacing distributions is a problem that has to be solved .",
    "parallel with the exact canonical calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite approximate methods have been suggested for constructing the canonical partition function of the normal ( nonsuperconducting ) systems .",
    "one of them ref .",
    "@xcite replaces the projection integral over the gauge variable @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) by the discrete sum that involves @xmath26 terms .",
    "these terms depend on @xmath27 ( instead of @xmath24 ) where the integer @xmath28 varies from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "as shown in sec.1 this method can be viewed as the partial projection .",
    "it is the more precise the higher is the value of @xmath26 . in ref .",
    "@xcite this method was employed by frauendorf and pashkevich to calculate sodium cluster shape and free energies .",
    "another method suggested by rossignoli consists in the evaluation of projection integral in the saddle - point approximation .",
    "such approach turns out to be quite satisfactory in the case of not very small temperatures and particle numbers as was demonstrated by calculations of nuclear level densities in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our effective version of the canonical approach is based on the polynomial representation of the partition function .",
    "last years such representation is discussed in the literature  @xcite , however our practical version of polynomial calculations was elaborated many years ago for a projection method applied to the bardin - cooper - schriffer ( @xmath31 ) function for describing the particle number conserving pairing correlations in nuclei  @xcite .",
    "there is an obvious analogy between the @xmath31 function and grand canonical partition function for the independent electron model ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "both can be represented as products @xmath33 , where @xmath34 for the @xmath31 function is @xmath35 ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 are the bogolubov parameters , @xmath38 is the operator of the fermion pair creation in time conjugated states @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) while for the canonical partition function @xmath34 is @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 being the energy of a single -particle state @xmath39 and the chemical potential respectively . after projection onto a fixed particle number @xmath0",

    "@xmath0 the total number of terms in @xmath0 may be enormous , however a hierarchy of terms can be established according to their surviving at @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is the pairing strength ) or @xmath48 .",
    "the first term of this hierarchy corresponds to the independent fermion ground state in which all single - particle states are occupied up to @xmath49 .",
    "the second group of terms corresponds to simplest excitations : in the @xmath31 theory it is a particle pair @xmath50 above @xmath49 and a hole pair @xmath51 beneath @xmath49 , for free electrons in a cluster it is one particle - hole excitations .",
    "the third group of terms corresponds to a shift of two @xmath31 particle pairs or two cluster electrons above @xmath49 .",
    "this alignment of many particle - hole excitations continues till all pairs or cluster electrons are lifted above @xmath49 .",
    "the common property of the projected @xmath31 and the canonical partition functions is mutual independence of probabilities of particle and hole excitations .",
    "this probability depends only on the energy of the single - particle level on which a @xmath31 fermion pair or a cluster electron is located . for the @xmath31 case it is @xmath52 for levels with @xmath53 while for levels with @xmath54 it is @xmath55  , for cluster electrons it is @xmath56 if @xmath57 , or @xmath41 if @xmath54 . thus summing over particle and hole excitations can be performed independently .",
    "the contribution of each group of @xmath58-particle excitations to @xmath44 $ ] includes a sum running distributions of @xmath58 electrons ( here we mean cluster electrons ) over particle levels ( with energies above @xmath49 ) .",
    "these sums can be also represented as symmetric polynomials , now they are of @xmath58-th order ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "analogous polynomials arise for hole excitations , but in this case electrons are distributed over hole levels ( below and including @xmath49 ) . though the convergence of appearing series is absolute its rate is determined by @xmath60 .",
    "practically for @xmath61 they include not more than 5 components ( i.e. up to 5 particle-5 hole excitations ) .",
    "our calculations for the pairing problem have indicated high effectiveness of the polynomial representation of the @xmath0-projected @xmath31-function  @xcite and this paper is devoted to the adaptation of the polynomial representation to the canonical partition function of normal mesoscopic systems .",
    "the material is arranged as following . in sec.2 separation of the full configuration space into two parts , inside and outside the fermi sphere , is realized to construct the canonical partition function @xmath62 as a symmetrical polynomial of @xmath0-th order .",
    "@xmath62 is expanded in polynomials of lower orders .",
    "these series are composed of products of  particle `` and ' ' hole  polynomials , the order of which points out how many particles and holes take part in excitations allowed for in @xmath62 . in sec.3",
    "these polynomials are employed to one- and two - body density matrices and on this base the canonical expressions for the heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility are compared to the grand canonical ones .",
    "sec.4 collects recurrent relations for polynomials we apply in calculations .",
    "sec.5 shows that in a wide range of temperatures and particle numbers the elaborated method possesses high convergence and can be used for various types of single - electron energy spectra .",
    "the conclusion is given in sec.6 .",
    "algebraic details for the equal level spacing model and the exact canonical partition function of the model are considered in appendix .",
    "if a system is composed of a fixed number @xmath0 of constituent particles and possesses a discrete excitation spectrum the thermodynamic properties of the canonical ensemble ( @xmath63 ) of such systems can be described by using the partition function @xmath62    @xmath64    the index @xmath65 labels energy states of this system @xmath66 , @xmath67 concerns the ground state .",
    "the calculation of @xmath66 for many body systems is a complicated problem and in this paper we limit ourselves by the @xmath32 which in many cases is a good start approximation .",
