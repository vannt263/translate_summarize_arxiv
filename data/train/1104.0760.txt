    "cosmology has recently entered a precision , data - driven era .",
    "the availability of ever larger , higher - quality datasets has led to the so - called concordance model .",
    "this is a remarkably simple model ( with a small number of free parameters ) which provides a very good fit to the existing data ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is a price to pay for this success : the data suggests that @xmath4 of the contents of the universe are in a still unknown form , that so far has never been seen in a laboratory .",
    "this is often called the dark sector of the universe .",
    "current best estimates suggest that this dark sector is in fact a combination of two distinct components ( see e.g. @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the first is called dark matter ( making up about @xmath5 of the universe ) and it is clustered in large - scale structures like galaxies .",
    "the second , which has gravitational properties very similar to those of the cosmological constant first proposed by einstein , is called dark energy and currently dominates the universe , with about @xmath6 of its density .",
    "understanding what constitutes this dark energy is one of the most important problems of modern cosmology . in particular",
    ", we would like to find out if it is indeed a cosmological constant , since there are many possible alternatives .",
    "these alternative models often involve scalar fields , an example of which is the higgs field which the lhc is searching for .",
    "there are two main differences between the cosmological constant and the models involving scalar fields ( which are often collectively called dynamical dark energy models ) .",
    "first , in the former case the density of dark energy is a constant while in the latter the dark energy density does change .",
    "second , the scalar fields will necessarily couple to other fields ( unless they are prevented from doing so by symmetry principles ) and thus can lead to further distinguishing features @xcite such as variations of nature s fundamental couplings . a case in point",
    "is the coupling of the scalar field to the electromagnetic sector of the model , which will lead to spacetime variations of the fine - structure constant @xmath0 .",
    "one way to distinguish a cosmological constant from dynamical dark energy is therefore to find several independent ways to measure the dark energy density ( or its equation of state @xmath7 ) at several epochs in the universe , while at the same time searching for variations of @xmath0 or other dimensionless couplings @xcite .",
    "cosmic microwave background anisotropies ( cmb hereafter ) have provided in the past years a powerful method to constrain variations in the fine structure constant in the early universe , at the epoch of recombination ( see e.g. @xcite ) at the level of @xmath8 . in the most recent analysis , parametrizing a variation in the fine structure constant as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the standard ( local ) value and @xmath0 is the value during the recombination process , the authors of @xcite used the five year wmap data , finding the constraint @xmath11 at @xmath12 c.l ..    the presence of a scalar field at recombination could induce variations in the fine structure constant . while the effects of a cosmological constant at recombination are completely negligible , dynamical scalar fields could track the dominant energy component , be present at recombination and induce variations in @xmath0 if coupled to the electromagnetic sector .",
    "it is therefore timely to check for variations of the fine structure constant in cosmological data allowing at the same time the presence of an  early \" dark energy component at recombination .",
    "all recent cosmological constraints on @xmath0 have indeed been obtained under the assumption of a cosmological constant or of a dark energy component with constant equation of state @xmath13 ( @xcite ) , i.e. in the case of a negligible dark component at recombination .",
    "clearly , if a dark energy is present in the early universe , degeneracies between the parameters may arise and change the current results .",
    "moreover , in the past year , a significant experimental progress in determining the cmb angular power spectrum has been made , most notably from the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "this new data , as we will see in the next sections , substantially improve previous constraints on @xmath0 .    in this paper we indeed follow this way of reasoning and we produce new constraints on variation of @xmath0 allowing at the same time for the presence of dark energy at recombination . in order to be as general as possible , we describe the scalar field adopting a phenomelogical approach , considering an early dark energy model ( hereafter , ede ) as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we consider a class of models where the link between the dark energy and electromagnetic sectors is explicit .",
    "specifically we discuss present and future constraints on ede models having the simplest allowed ( linear ) coupling to electromagnetism .",
    "our paper is therefore structured as follows : in the next section we briefly describe the early dark energy model considered and its coupling to electromagnetic sector . in section iii we present the data analysis method used while in section iv we discuss our results .",
    "as discussed in the previous section we aim to place constraints on variations of the fine structure constant with a non - negligible scalar field at recombination . we describe the scalar field with a ede model @xcite where the dark energy density parameter and equation of state are parametrized in the following way :    @xmath14 } \\frac{d\\ln{\\omega_{\\rm de}}(a)}{d\\ln a } + \\frac{a_{eq}}{3(a + a_{eq } ) }   \\label{eq : edew } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the scale factor at matter - radiation equality and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the current dark energy and matter density , respectively .",
    "a flat universe is assumed so @xmath18 and the present value for the equation of state is obtained from demanding @xmath19 .",
    "the energy density @xmath20 has a scaling behaviour evolving with time and going to a finite constant @xmath21 in the past .",
    "the dark energy equation of state @xmath22 follows the behaviours of the dominant component at each cosmic time : @xmath23 during radiation domination , @xmath24 during matter domination , and @xmath25 in recent epochs as in a cosmological constant era .",
    "we add dark energy perturbations as in @xcite by considering the ede clustering properties through the effective sound speed @xmath26 and a viscosity parameter @xmath27 accounting for the presence of anisotropic stresses . in the present analysis",
    "we assume these clustering parameters as constant with @xmath28 and @xmath29 as expected in the case of a scalar field . for simplicity",
    "we also fix @xmath30 since this value is well constrained by low redshift data .    in any realistic dynamical scalar field scenario",
    ", the scalar field should be coupled to the rest of the model , unless one postulates a ( yet unknown ) symmetry to suppress the coupling .",
    "we are presently interested in the coupling between the scalar field and electromagnetism , which we take to be of the form : @xmath31 where the gauge kinetic function @xmath32 is linear , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; @xmath35 is therefore the relevant coupling , and among other things it is related to the amount of equivalence principle violations .",
    "constraints on this coupling are tight at low redshift ; conservatively we have @xcite : @xmath36 in this work we will derive an analogous but independent constraint coming from the cmb .",
    "this form of the gauge kinetic function can be seen as the first term of a taylor expansion , and given the tight low - redshift constraints on varying couplings it is a good approximation for a slowly varying field at low redshift . here",
    "we are extending it all the way to the cmb epoch . in this case ,",
    "how good an approximation this is will be more model - dependent .",
    "however , given that a purely phenomenological parametrization for ede is already being assumed , this choice of parametrization for the gauge kinetic function should be quite adequate .",
    "we will comment further on these choices at the end of the paper .",
    "this being said , the evolution of alpha is given by : @xmath37 and since the evolution of the scalar field can be expressed in terms of the dark energy properties @xmath38 and @xmath13 as @xcite : @xmath39 ( where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the logarithm of the scale factor ) we finally obtain the following explicit relation specifiying the evolution of the fine structure constant in the early dark energy class of models : @xmath40 as expected the magnitude of the variation is controlled by the strength of the coupling @xmath35 .",
    "we have modified the camb @xcite code for early dark energy as in @xcite and we include variations in the fine structure constant in the recombination process using the method adopted in @xcite and modifying the publicly available recfast @xcite routine .",
    "we constrain variation in the fine structure constant @xmath41 and @xmath21 by a cosmomc analysis of the most recent cmb data .",
    "the analysis method we adopt is based on the publicly available markov chain monte carlo package ` cosmomc ` @xcite with a convergence diagnostics done through the gelman and rubin statistics .",
    "we sample the following eight - dimensional set of cosmological parameters , adopting flat priors on them : the baryon and cold dark matter densities @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the hubble parameter @xmath44 , the scalar spectral index @xmath45 , the overall normalization of the spectrum @xmath46 at @xmath47 mpc@xmath48 , the optical depth to reionization , @xmath49 , the ratio of the values of the fine structure constant then and now @xmath41 and , finally , the primordial amount of early dark energy @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , we consider purely adiabatic initial conditions and we impose spatial flatness .",
    "we consider wmap7 @xcite and act @xcite as cmb datasets and we analyze datasets out to @xmath50 . in order to investigate the impact of the recent act dataset alone we perform two different analysis , wmap7 and wmap7+act as cmb probes .",
    "for the act dataset we moreover consider two extra parameters accounting for the poisson and clustering point source foreground components .",
    "we also include informations on dark energy from baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in galaxy surveys @xcite , and finally we impose a prior on the hubble parameter based on the hubble space telescope observations @xcite .",
    "more recently , new and improved constraints on the hubble parameter have been reported in @xcite and we also perform some analyses considering this new more stringent prior referring to it as hst2 .",
    "in table [ tab : wdm ] we report the constraints on the @xmath51 and @xmath21 parameters obtained from the cosmomc analysis , using the different combinations of datasets described in the previous section .",
    "notice the significant improvements on both parameters provided by the small - scale act data .",
    "as expected , beacuse of the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath44 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , we found an improvement in the constraint on @xmath0 of about @xmath52 when hst2 is considered .",
    "however , when also act and bao are added , the degeneracy is broken and we do not have any relevant contribution from hst2 .",
    ".limits at @xmath2 c.l . on @xmath41 , @xmath21 and the coupling @xmath35 from the mcmc anlyses .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we report in figure [ fisher ] the 2-dimensional contour plots in the @xmath53 plane showing the @xmath54 and @xmath55 regions for planck with solid lines and cmbpol with dashed lines .",
    "the effect of the better polarization data in further constraining @xmath0 is quite noticeable .",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath2 c.l",
    ". estimated constraints on the @xmath41 vs @xmath21 plane from planck ( solid lines ) and cmbpol ( dashed lines).,width=272 ]",
    "we have discussed present constraints on variations of the fine structure constant @xmath0 in the context of phenomenological class of early dark energy where the putative dynamical scalar field is coupled to the electromagnetic sector of the theory through the simplest allowed ( linear ) coupling .",
    "we have found no significant correlation between @xmath41 and the early dark energy density parameter @xmath56 , providing the constraints @xmath1 and @xmath3 at @xmath2 c.l .",
    "the constraints on @xmath0 are significantly improved with respect to the wmap five - years constraint @xcite , thanks to the new act data .",
    "moreover we have used the cmb and other cosmological datasets to also constrain the dimensionless parameter quantifying the strength of the scalar field coupling , @xmath35 , at the epoch of decoupling , in addition to constraining @xmath0 itself . while the current data only allowed us to obtain a constraint on @xmath35 that is about 20 times weaker than those obtainable locally ( which come from equivalence principle tests ) , we emphasize that the two contraints are independent",
    ". moreover , forthcoming or future missions , such as planck surveyor and cmbpol , can match and possibly even surpass the sensitivity of current local tests .    admittedly the toy model which we have studied may well be too simplistic , and we are currently investigating how sensitive our results are to our choice of parametrization .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that the model has the clear virtue of being predictive enough to be confirmed or ruled out by forthcoming experiments .",
    "this will require a combination of cosmological datasets ( planck being the best example ) and better low - redshift constraints on variations of @xmath0 , which will soon be available .",
    "finally , this work is an example of how one can use the early universe as a laboratory in which to directly probe fundamental physics scenarios , in ways that will complement and enhance local , small - scale tests .",
    "moreover , further avenues for searching for new physics will soon be available .",
    "now that experiments such as microscope@xcite and aces @xcite are getting ready to perform equivalence principle tests in microgravity , it is encouraging that there are good prospects for carrying out analogous tests on astrophysical and cosmological scales .",
    "synergies between local experiments and cosmological observations will soon allow us to probe unexplored aspects of gravity and fundamental physics .",
    "we will revisit these issues in future work .",
