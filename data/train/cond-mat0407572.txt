    "in many physical systems , local barriers prevent the onset of steady - state motion or conduction unless a certain minimum threshold for an externally applied driving force or bias is exceeded .",
    "often , the strength of those barriers varies throughout the system and only their statistical distribution is known .",
    "a key issue then concerns how the global threshold for onset of motion is related to the distribution of local threshold values .",
    "examples include the onset of resistance due to depinning of fluxline motion in type - ii superconductors , the onset of mechanical motion in coupled frictional systems such as sand piles , and the onset of current flow through networks of tunnel junctions in the coulomb blockade regime . in all of these cases , defects in the host material or the underlying substrate produce local traps or barriers of varying strength .    under an applied driving force , fluxlines , mobile particles or charge carriers from an external reservoir",
    "can penetrate the disordered energy landscape , becoming stuck at the traps or piling up in front of barriers . with increased drive",
    ", particles can surmount some of the barriers and penetrate further .",
    "however , a steady - state flow is only established once there is at least one continuous path connecting one side of the system with the other .",
    "the onset of steady - state transport then corresponds to finding the lowest - energy system - spanning path .",
    "this optimization problem was addressed in 1993 in a seminal paper by middleton and wingren ( mw).@xcite    using analytical arguments as well as computer simulations , mw found that , for the limit of negligible thermal energies , the onset of system - spanning motion corresponds to a second order phase transition as a function of applied bias .",
    "the global threshold value scales with distance across the system , but is independent of the details of the barrier size distribution . beyond threshold , more paths open up and the overall transport current increases . as a result , the steady - state transport current displays power law scaling as a function of excess bias .",
    "these predictions have subsequently been used extensively in the interpretation of single electron tunneling data from networks of lithographically defined junction arrays@xcite as well as from self - assembled nanoparticle systems.@xcite in addition , recent experiments@xcite and simulations@xcite have explored how the power law scaling is affected by structural disorder in the arrays .",
    "the regime of large structural disorder and significant voids in the array was investigated numerically using a percolation model.@xcite    what happens at finite temperature ? intuitively , one might expect temperature to produce a smearing of the local thresholds and thus a quick demise of the power law scaling for @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , a number of experiments have found that the nonlinear current - voltage characteristics observed at the lowest temperatures give way to nearly linear , ohmic behavior once @xmath4 is raised to a few dozen kelvin.@xcite more recently , however , several experiments showed that the scaling behavior survives with a well - defined , albeit now temperature - dependent , global threshold . in a previous letter , we demonstrated for a two - dimensional metal nanocrystal array that a ) the threshold is only weakly temperature dependent , decreasing linearly with increasing @xmath4 , and b ) the scaling exponent remains unaffected by temperature .",
    "consequently , the shape of the nonlinear response as a function of applied drive remains constant and is merely shifted to lower drive values as @xmath4 increased.@xcite    similar behavior was also observed in small 2d metal nanoparticle networks by ancona _ et al._@xcite and cordan _ et al._@xcite and in 1d chains of carbon particles by bezryadin .",
    "_ et al._@xcite most recently , it was corroborated by simulations of ( semi - classical ) particles in 2d arrays of pinning sites with random strengths.@xcite this weak temperature dependence of the nonlinear response also has important practical consequences as it implies that arrays are much more robust and forgiving as compared to systems with a single threshold that might be significantly affected by its local environment .",
    "however , the theoretical approach developed by mw considers only the zero - temperature limit where the local energy levels are sharply delineated and barriers between adjacent sites are well - defined . in ref .",
    "we introduced the main results from a new model that extends the mw approach to finite temperatures . here , we develop this model in more detail , providing both analytical results and data from computer simulations .",
    "for concreteness , we focus on single electron tunneling through metal nanoparticle arrays . however , we expect the main results to carry over to a much wider class of systems with distributed thresholds due to quenched disorder .",
    "our model goes beyond previous work in two important aspects .",
    "first , we introduce a method that allows us to treat finite temperatures .",
    "this method is based on estimating when small barriers , washed out by temperature , have percolated across the system , and it establishes an upper limit on the global threshold as a function of temperature .",
    "a key finding is that random quenched disorder leads to universal behavior that is independent of the details of the barrier height distribution .",
    "second , we include nearest neighbor capacitive coupling .",
    "this leads us to a new definition of the relevant effective charging energy for system crossing , in terms of the most probable value in the distribution of energy costs . as shown in ref .",
    ", the model captures the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the drive - response characteristics and predicts the collapse of the global threshold as a function of temperature on a universal curve that is independent of local junction parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we outline the basic ingredients of our model , mainly focusing on the limit of negligible interparticle coupling .",
    "section iii then calculates the shape of the probability distribution of energy costs for the general case of finite nearest neighbor coupling . in section",
    "iv we present simulation results for various network geometries .",
    "we also discuss the validity of the percolation model and show numerical results for the decrease of the threshold with temperature .",
    "section v describes how the current - voltage characteristics behave at temperatures above the point where the voltage threshold reaches zero .",
    "section vi contains a discussion of the model and comparisons with recent experimental data and as well as with numerical results from related systems .",
    "we consider one- or two - dimensional arrays of spherical metal nanoparticles ( `` sites '' ) , placed between two in - plane metal electrodes .",
    "we ignore any particle - internal level spacing due to quantum size effects and treat each site as possessing a continuous spectrum of available states up to some local chemical potential .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for metal particles with diameters larger than a couple nanometers at temperatures above liquid helium . for such particles , the largest energy besides",
    "thermal energy is the electrostatic energy associated with the transfer of additional , single electrons .",
    "we consider interparticle spacings small enough to allow for such transfer by electron tunneling .",
    "we make the usual assumptions of the `` orthodox theory '' of single electron tunneling ( see , e.g. , likharev in ref . ) , namely that the tunnel time is negligible in comparison with all other time scales , the tunnel resistance @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the quantum of resistance , co - tunnel events due to coherent quantum processes can be ignored , and the local tunnel rate from site to site depends only on the change in electrostatic free energy of the system , @xmath7 , that would result from a tunnel event . at low temperatures ,",
    "a positive @xmath7 implies a suppression of tunneling ( coulomb blockade ) , and current flows only after an external bias has been applied that compensates for this energy cost .",
    "if tunneling occurs from a site at higher energy to one at lower energy ( @xmath8 ) , we assume that the energy difference is lost due to scattering processes in the destination particle ( inelastic tunneling ) .    throughout the paper , we consider the limit of negligible structural disorder of the arrays , i.e. , all sites are identical in terms of both their tunnel coupling and capacitive coupling to neighbors , as well as in their self - capacitance .",
    "disorder enters in form of a random distribution of the local chemical potentials at every site due to quenched offset charges .",
    "this quenched charge disorder models charge fluctuations due to impurities in the substrate which in turn polarize the nanoparticles .",
    "a corresponding experimental system can be realized as shown in ref . by self - assembling , onto an insulating substrate , ligand - coated nanoparticles from solution .",
    "the ligands prevent nanoparticle sintering and well - ordered arrays are formed through a balance between attractive van der waals forces and repulsive steric hindrance between ligands from neighboring particles",
    ". for dodecanethiol ligands and particle diameters in the range 4.5 nm to 7 nm , a size dispersion of less than 5% can be achieved , resulting in 2d arrays with excellent long - range order of the particle packing .",
    "electronic measurements , both on nanoparticle arrays but also on self - assembled monolayers of molecules by themselves , have shown that alkanethiol ligands act as mechanical spacers and do not otherwise affect the transport properties.@xcite consequently , they set the width of the tunnel barrier between neighboring nanoparticles but do not introduce states inside the barrier .",
    "the quenched charge disorder is not a perturbative effect : in principle , the chemical potential of a nanoscale particle can be shifted by a nearby trapped charge as much as it would be by an added mobile electron .",
    "therefore , electrons in an array propagate through a network of junctions with randomly varying threshold voltages .",
    "note that the mobile charges are quantized ( electrons ) and thus move the local chemical potential by the same amount , @xmath9 , every time a single charge enters or leaves a site .",
    "on the other hand , the quenched charges model a polarization effect and thus can move the local chemical potentials continuously , just like a local gate electrode could .",
    "the overall energy cost , @xmath7 , associated with a tunnel event therefore has to take into account the effect of both discrete mobile charges and of a continuous random distribution of quenched charges .",
    "one might expect conduction through large arrays to depend on the details of the local quenched , or background , charge distribution .",
    "however , zero - temperature arguments by mw indicate that this is not the case,@xcite as least in the limit of negligible capacitive coupling between sites . instead ,",
    "the overall array current - voltage characteristics ( ivs ) appear to be robust to background charge disorder and exhibit a non - zero effective voltage threshold , @xmath10 , that scales linearly with array size ( i.e. , distance between electrodes ) .    to see this , consider first a 1d array at @xmath11 with a given distribution of quenched polarization charge values .",
    "because mobile electrons can compensate for local polarizations in integer multiples of @xmath12 , the electronic charge , only disorder in the range @xmath13 $ ] needs to be considered . starting from an initial state of zero applied overall bias , mobile charges can penetrate , say from the left , single - file into the disordered potential landscape until they first encounter a local up - step in electrostatic potential , @xmath14 . at this point ,",
    "the coulomb blockade prevents further advance .    to the left of the up - step ,",
    "each site now has one additional charge on it and all potentials have been raised uniformly by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the self - capacitance of each site . in order to move the charge front further toward the right electrode , the bias applied to the left electrode has to be raised .",
    "each time an up - step is encountered anywhere in the array , a bias increment of @xmath15 at the left electrode will suffice to advance the front .",
    "thus , the minimum bias required in order for mobile charges to make it all the way across the array will be given by the number of up - steps times @xmath15 ( recall that down - steps in local potential do not matter as tunneling is assumed to be inelastic ) .",
    "in other words , the @xmath17 , global threshold for conduction for an array of @xmath18 sites is given by ref .",
    "as @xmath19 if we now assume a flat , random distribution of quenched charges , on average half of the steps between neighboring sites will be up - steps .",
    "therefore , for 1d arrays @xmath20 .",
    "note that this argument of mw depends only on the number of up - steps , but not on their magnitude @xmath21 !",
    "thus , details of the distribution of step sizes are irrelevant at @xmath17 .",
    "this also holds for 2d systems , except that now the mobile charges can , to some extent , avoid up - steps .",
    "consequently , there will be some roughness in the front of charges advancing across the array below threshold .",
    "equation [ mwvt ] still holds , with @xmath18 now the distance across the gap between the electrodes .",
    "@xmath22 is the number of up - steps in the path across the array with the least number of up - steps ( `` optimal path '' ) .",
    "the value of @xmath23 in 2d will be smaller than in 1d and depend on the array topology .",
    "unfortunately , analytical arguments that would predict @xmath23 for 2d systems are not known and one has to resort to computer simulations . specifically , for a close - packed triangular arrangement of spheres we find",
    "@xmath24 ( see section iv ) .    in order to model the effect of finite temperature on the global threshold for conduction , we start by considering thermal fluctuations at the local , single junction level .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the change in the electrostatic potential energy of the system when a single electron moves from one site to another .",
    "if @xmath25 , the coulomb blockade vanishes and the junction conductance will exhibit linear , ohmic behavior down to the lowest bias voltage .    as a first approximation , we now coarse - grain the system into two categories of tunnel junctions",
    ". junctions between sites with energy differences @xmath26 will be treated as if @xmath11 , implying a fully nonlinear response and , below threshold , the absence of zero - bias conductance .",
    "junctions between sites with energy differences @xmath27 will be treated as if @xmath28 and all coulomb blockade effects were removed , implying a linear response like ohmic conductors .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 measures the extent of thermal broadening and depends on details of the electronic level distribution .",
    "if energy levels are within @xmath30 , then electrons from thermally excited states above the fermi level on site i can tunnel directly into available states below the fermi level on neighboring site j. this means that up - steps within @xmath30 are effectively removed .    to determine @xmath29 , we consider in each nanoparticle the width of the tail of unoccupied states below and of occupied states above the fermi level .",
    "each tail has an approximate width of @xmath31 so that @xmath32 is reduced by roughly @xmath33 and thus @xmath34 . to make this argument more quantitative",
    ", we consider the mean energy of states above the fermi energy @xmath35 in particle i , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the density of states and @xmath38 is the fermi - dirac function . evaluating the integral as a series and determining the coefficients numerically , we obtain @xmath39 . by symmetry",
    ", the mean energy of the low - energy unoccupied tail in particle j will be @xmath40 .",
    "tunneling from the high - energy tail of particle i to the low - energy tail of particle j thus will cost a mean energy @xmath41 .",
    "this leads to @xmath42 .    as temperature",
    "is raised , more and more junctions will satisfy @xmath43 and lose their nonlinear behavior .",
    "we define @xmath44 as the fraction of junctions that has been effectively linearized .",
    "since both up- and down - steps will be affected equally by thermal smearing , @xmath44 can be found from @xmath45 if the distribution of step heights , given by the probability density @xmath46 , is known .",
    "the process of linearizing will happen randomly throughout the array until , at some temperature @xmath47 , sufficiently many junctions have been replaced by ohmic conductors that a continuous path involving only such conductors spans the array . at this point , the overall response will necessarily also be linear and the threshold must have reached zero : @xmath48",
    ".    an upper limit on when this point is reached can be obtained from percolation theory by considering the two classes of junctions as two types of bonds between neighboring sites . at small overall bias",
    ", we can label the nonlinear junctions as insulators and the ohmic ones as conductors . if a ( temperature - dependent )",
    "fraction @xmath44 of all junctions in the array has been linearized , and in the absence of correlations between neighboring junctions , the first continuous path of linear conductors across the array occurs , on average , at a critical fraction @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath2 is the bond percolation threshold which depends only on lattice topology and dimension ( for corrections due to correlations see section iv ) . using eq .",
    "[ ptint ] , we thus find @xmath47 through @xmath49    as a consequence of these considerations , the global threshold will be a decreasing function of temperature and approach zero as @xmath50 .",
    "hence , to first order , @xmath51    in order to proceed and find the linearized fraction of junctions , @xmath44 , we need to know more about the actual distribution @xmath52 of energy costs .",
    "it will be calculated in detail in section iii . however , a few important aspects are already clear from eq .",
    "[ ptint ] .",
    "in particular , since @xmath53 is no larger than 1/4 for 2d lattices,@xcite we have to integrate over only a small portion of @xmath46 in order to reach a significant suppression of the threshold .",
    "if @xmath46 does not change much over this range , we find @xmath54 and @xmath44 is proportional to temperature",
    ". the relevant energy scale , @xmath1 , can be thought of as an effective charging energy , while @xmath29 depends only on the shape of the internal energy distribution of the metal particle and thus is independent of topology , dimensionality and the effects of coupling .",
    "we will see in section iii that this is a reasonable approximation not only for the case of zero capacitive coupling , but even more so when nearest neighbor coupling is included .",
    "physically this is so because coupling flattens out the polarization - induced disorder in the energy landscape and small energy costs become more probable so that @xmath46 decays slower for small @xmath7 . combining eqs .",
    "[ vtpt ] and [ ptpz ] we see that the normalized threshold decays linearly with temperature according to @xmath55 where we have used the result @xmath42 obtained earlier . in analogy with the @xmath17 result eq .",
    "[ mwvt ] , the right hand side of this equation represents @xmath56 , the temperature - dependent number of up - steps in the optimal path normalized by the number at zero temperature .",
    "equation [ vtt ] is a central result of this paper .",
    "it predicts a linear depression of the global threshold with temperature , with a prefactor @xmath57 that is universal and does not depend on the details of the threshold distribution .",
    "to calculate @xmath46 , we start from the electrostatic energy of a system of capacitors , @xmath58 where the @xmath59 are quenched , offset charges and the @xmath60 are mobile charges ( equal to an integer multiple of @xmath61c or zero ) .",
    "the @xmath62 are elements of the inverse capacitance tensor .",
    "note that @xmath63 , in the standard definition of the capacitance tensor , does include contributions from coupling to nearest neighbors if such coupling is present .",
    "we define the energy difference before / after tunneling of a single electron from site 1 to site 2 as @xmath64 in the absence of any quenched charge disorder ( @xmath65 ) we have @xmath66 , and there is no cost associated with moving charges around inside the array . in other words",
    ", there is no coulomb blockade of tunneling ( even though @xmath67 ) and the current - voltage characteristic will be linear .",
    "now imagine a flat , random distribution of quenched polarization charges in the range @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "as before , this range suffices because larger offsets will be compensated by mobile charges of magnitude @xmath12 . in the limit of negligible capacitive coupling between sites considered for now , this leads to @xmath69    to deal with nearest neighbor capacitive coupling , we focus here on the case of a close - packed , triangular lattice simply for the sake of having a concrete picture in mind and for direct comparison with experiments . in general ,",
    "any lattice type can be treated the same way and the differences affect only the quantitative results for the capacitance tensor elements .",

    "the key points emerging from equations [ deltenon ] and [ deltesum ] are that the system energy cost associated with a tunnel event is not equivalent to the change in chemical potential of a single site , and that existence of a range of polarization charges @xmath59 gives rise to a distribution of energy costs @xmath7 .    to calculate the full distribution @xmath46 of energy differences , we need to first find the distributions @xmath83 and @xmath84 resulting from the addition of 2 or 6 random variables . in general , the probability of obtaining a value @xmath85 from the sum ( or difference ) of @xmath86 independent random numbers @xmath87 can be calculated from their recursion relation : @xmath88    using fourier transform to convert the convolution into a product , we get @xmath89 .",

    "how does @xmath196 depend on temperature ?",
    "to address this point , we revisit a simplifying approximation made in the model , namely the coarse - graining in which non - linearized junctions were assumed to be unaffected by thermal fluctuations and to exhibit zero conductance below threshold . in principle , of course , finite @xmath4 will always induce some zero - bias conductance . for a single junction this zero - bias conductance exhibits activated behavior ,",

    "consequently , the overall zero - bias conductance will be exponentially suppressed to a level where @xmath196 is well approximated by the coarse - graining approximation .    once @xmath47 is approached , linearized junctions for the first time form a system - spanning path .",

    "as before , the key point here is that the activation energy is not simply the charging energy of an isolated grain , but is connected to the optimal path across an energy landscape established by the quenched charge disorder . for 2d triangular arrays",

    "the model described in the preceding sections provides a physical picture for the role of thermal fluctuations as they affect the nonlinear transport properties in systems with random local thresholds for conduction .",
    "one key aspect is that such systems can not be described by associating a single , fixed energy cost with charge motion from site to site .",

    "[ mwvt ] ( the original mw result ) or its modification for finite coupling strength , eq . [ vteeff ] , are a direct consequence of quenched charge disorder .",
    "however , as far as the global threshold is concerned , the detailed shape of the full energy cost distribution turns out to be not critical .",
    "rather , as we showed by mapping the system onto an equivalent percolation problem , the behavior is dominated by the lowest - cost percentiles ( up to @xmath53 ) . to very good approximation , this is captured by the zero - cost , peak value of the probability density , @xmath118 ( eqs .

    "there are several predictions that emerge from the analytic model .    - first",
    ", the model predicts a linear decrease of the overall , global threshold with temperature ( eq . [ vtt ] ) .",
    "this decrease is directly proportional to @xmath209 , the strength of thermal fluctuations measured relative to the effective charging energy @xmath1 .",
    "what is particularly appealing about this result is that all details about capacitive coupling and particle geometry enter through @xmath118 , while the numerical prefactor , @xmath210 , captures the underlying network topology and dimension through the percolation threshold , @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , data from systems with similar structure but different particle sizes , spacings , or dielectric constants should collapse onto a  universal \" curve when plotted as @xmath211 versus @xmath212 .    - second , for sufficiently broad distributions of quenched charge disorder we expect that thermal fluctuations do not alter the basic character and roughness of the energy landscape .",
    "thus we expect mw s zero - temperature powerlaw scaling of the nonlinear current - voltage ( @xmath189 ) characteristics , @xmath213 , to survive at finite @xmath4 with fixed exponent @xmath193 , but with @xmath128 replaced by @xmath194 .",
    "in other words , the shape of the @xmath189 characteristics remains unaffected by temperature while they are shifted linearly towards smaller threshold values .    -",
