    "the first step in constructing the model is to partition the system into the three regions shown in fig .",

    ". they will be critical to describing the bending of the electronic bands and overcome the length scales that characterize electrostatic screening in the depletion region of the electrode , as explained below .      to obtain the equilibrium free energy of the system ,",
    "we place a plane of countercharge @xmath66 in region ( i ) , representing the defect charge in the bulk of the semiconductor , and another plane of countercharge @xmath67 in region ( iii ) , representing the ionic charge of the electrolyte .",
    "accordingly , an explicit charge @xmath68 is added to the slab of region ( ii ) so that charge neutrality is fulfilled .",
    "this planar setup provides an accurate approximation of the electrolytic side [ region ( iii ) ] of a semiconductor  electrolyte interface in the case of a concentrated electrolyte where the ionic concentrations ( 0.11 m ) are significantly larger than typical doping concentrations in the semiconductor .",
    "this means that most of the potential drop takes place in the bulk of the semiconductor [ region ( iii ) ] , making a plane of countercharge a reliable representation of the response of the electrolyte [ region ( i ) ] ( the helmholtz model ) .",
    "furthermore , on the semiconductor side , it is important to mention that adding a plane of countercharge does not lead to any loss of generality in the solution of the problem .",
    "this can be seen by noting that once the helmholtz plane of countercharges in region ( iii ) is set and the asymptotic boundary conditions of poisson s equation inside the electrolyte is fixed , the fermi energy @xmath8 and charge density @xmath44 at the surface are fully determined ; they do not depend on the specific shape of the defect charge profile in virtue of gauss law .",
    "in other words , the charge distribution and potential profile on the right hand side provide an accurate description of the interaction of the electrode with solution .",
    "( a ) the potential of a charged slab with planes of countercharge on each side , creating a potential drop . the dotted line represents the electrostatic potential @xmath69 of the charged slab subtracted from that of a slab with zero charge as shown in fig .",

    "( b ) a cutoff value @xmath70 corresponding to the inflection of the potential @xmath69 is determined . to the left of this cutoff a mott ",
    "schottky extrapolation is applied , as shown by the new dotted line . a dichotomy procedure on the surface charge",
    "is then applied to match the fermi levels of region ( i ) and region ( ii ) .",
    "the width of the depletion region is shortened here for illustrative purposes and would normally extend for several nanometers . ]",
    "although the electrostatic profile in regions ( ii ) and ( iii ) is accurate , the potential in region ( i ) is still not a reliable representation of the electrostatics of a semiconductor electrode where region ( i ) consists of an infinite extension of region ( ii ) .",
    "to accurately describe the electrostatic potential in region ( i ) , a cutoff plane is introduced within the slab as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] , and the electrostatic potential to the left of the cutoff is set to follow the solution of the electrostatic equations of a continuum dielectric .",
    "the region to the right of the cutoff ( but still within the explicit slab ) will be taken as region ( ii ) , representing the surface states . from the value of the electrostatic potential and its derivative at the cutoff plane",
    ", the fermi level of the bulk of the semiconductor in region ( i ) can be easily determined from the mott ",
    "schottky asymptotics [ eqs .   and ] : @xmath71 with @xmath72 @xmath73 for @xmath24-type and @xmath25-type semiconductor , respectively . in these equations ,",

    "[ fig_3]a .    finally , to find the equilibrium state of the charge electrode",
    ", we impose that the fermi level of the bulk of the semiconductor must equal the fermi level of the quantum slab : @xmath75 by fulfilling this condition , one can calculate the dependence of the charge density as a function of voltage , and the surface state density can finally be obtained as the total charge on the right hand side of the frontier defined by @xmath70 divided by the elementary charge @xmath76 .",
    "this computational protocol provides a straightforward and robust method to determine how surface states and adsorption affect the potential distribution and capacitance of the system .",
    "this approach is , however , limited in two respects .    first , the position of the frontier between region ( i ) and region ( ii ) defined by @xmath70 may affect the asymptotic value @xmath77 of the potential @xmath74 describing the overall trend of the potential @xmath78 across the interface .",
    "this variation is , however , small and can be easily evaluated from @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the electrostatic screening length of the semiconductor ; however , since the screening length @xmath80 is on the order of 1010@xmath2 nm , the sensitivity of @xmath77 to @xmath70 is negligible under relevant doping conditions .",
    "second , the range of charge that can be tested is dependent on the size of the slab .",
    "in fact , if the voltage drop between the two countercharge planes is larger than the band gap of the material , unphysical charge transfer by zener tunneling will take place between the two sides of the slab . in these cases ,",
    "smaller slabs serve to reduce the voltage drop for a constant helmholtz charge density .",
    "it is important , however , to verify that the fermi level converges with respect to the size of the slab used for the calculation .",
    "alternatively , this problem can be solved by implementing a fully self - consistent solution to eq .   in order to eliminate the unphysical slope of the electrostatic potential across the slab due to the absence of screening by the charged defects in fig .",
    "[ fig_3]a .",
    "we plan to implement this alternative method in the continuation of the present work , and we use , for the moment , the implementation described above to assess the predictive performance of the model .",
    "density - functional theory calculations are performed using the pw code of the quantum - espresso distribution.@xcite surface slabs of si(110 ) , @xmath0(110 ) , and rutile @xmath1 are created with a width of 5 layers , which is sufficient to give converged fermi levels within 0.01 ev .",
    "the slab is centered in the supercell with a vacuum height of 7   to ensure convergence of the atomic forces within @xmath81 a.u .",

    "the dft+@xmath83 approximation@xcite is used to correct for electronic self - interaction with a hubbard parameter value of 2.5 ev for ti based on the work of hu and metiu.@xcite as explained above , the electrostatic response of the electrolyte interface is modeled using the environ module with the parameterizations developed for water by andreussi et al.@xcite several different surface configurations of the @xmath1 surface are examined . in finding the equilibrium structure for these configurations ,",
    "the middle layer of the slab is frozen and the structure is relaxed .",
    "the equilibrium positions are then used in the semiconductor  interface model discussed above . to find the equilibrium charge distribution between the surface states and the bulk of the semiconductor , several different distributions of charge between @xmath66 and @xmath84",
    "are tested for a fixed @xmath67 . in specific terms , a dichotomy procedure is employed to match the fermi levels between the bulk and the surface .",
    "we use the cutoff value and charge distribution that minimizes the difference in fermi level between regions ( i ) and ( ii ) with a cutoff position @xmath85 in the middle layers of the slab where the material enters a bulk - like state .",
    "silicon electrodes represent an important test for the proposed method .",
    "when charge is placed on a slab of silicon with planes of countercharge , all of the electronic charge accumulates at the semiconductor edge.@xcite this contrasts strongly with the expected electron distribution throughout the material , implying that all the charge on a silicon semiconductor slab would tend to accumulate deep inside the bulk of the semiconductor , indicating that no surface states would exist . as a result",
    ", there is no combination of charges @xmath66 and @xmath84 that equalizes the fermi levels in region ( i ) and region ( ii ) [ eq .  ] .",
    "this suggests that no equilibrium charge distribution exists between the surface of silicon and its bulk state , offering conclusive insights into the instability of pure silicon in water at low potentials.@xcite    simulations with both hydrogen and oxygen attached to the surface of the silicon slab show charge distributed throughout the material but still do not result in an equilibrium charge distribution between the bulk and the surface .",
    "in contrast , simulations using @xmath0 as the surface layer show a distributed charge profile , enabling the fermi levels in region ( i ) and region ( ii ) to equilibrate , in accordance with suggestions from experimental studies.@xcite    to asses the validity of this prediction , we compare our results to accurate experimental measurements that take into account surface states in the analysis of silicon electrodes .",
    "the dependence of the surface state density as a function of the potential produced by chandrasekaran et al.@xcite for si(110 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] , also including our @xmath0 results .",
    "the agreement between these results strongly suggests that in the preparation of their sample , a @xmath0-like layer forms at the surface of the si sample , causing the response shown .",
    "this is entirely possible , since the authors washed the electrode in water before eventual contact with the electrolyte and the structure was not reexamined after this step .",
    "the surface state density as a function of the electrode potential for @xmath0 , compared with the experimental data of chandrasekaran et al.@xcite the dots represent the positions of minimum difference between the fermi level in region ( i ) and region ( ii ) .",
    "the error bars show the range of results seen with a tolerance in the fermi level matching of 0.01 ev . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] , it should be noted that the calculated points represent the values of the surface charge at which the calculated fermi levels match the most closely .",
    "the error bars show the range of results seen when the tolerance for matching fermi levels is set to 0.01 ev .",
    "this range is not always the same and the error bar increases in regions where the slope of the charge ",
    "voltage graph changes rapidly . due to the fact that the potential across the semiconductor slab can not be greater than the band gap or the electrode , the calculated points necessarily stops at some voltage .",
    "these results differ from what would be expected if solely the bulk of the semiconductor was taken into account in a standard mott ",
    "schottky treatment .",
    "the measurements of chandrasekaran et al.@xcite have consistently shown that at higher potentials , the charge ",
    "voltage response follows the square root dependence that would be expected from the mott ",
    "schottky theory .",
    "the onset of the square root behavior is seen in the experimental high - voltage region of fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] , while the proposed method provides a detailed understanding of the low - potential regime where charges on the surface states dominate the overall behavior of the electrode system , which is not captured by a purely classical mott  schottky approach .",
    "additionally , the dependence of the charge density of @xmath1 electrodes on the potential is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] . here",
    ", the referenced value of the flatband potential is aligned to the experimental measurement of nakamura et al.@xcite the results match an exponential trend at low potentials , following the behavior discussed above for silicon with a @xmath0 surface layer .",
    "the fraction of the total potential taken by each region is dominated by the surface states at potentials close to the flatband potential.@xcite this can also be seen in the charge versus potential graph where the surface state charge accounts for most of the total charge .",
    "the general trend is not strongly affected by the surface structure used , confirming again the central relevance of surface states in the behavior of all @xmath1 electrode surfaces .        while the overall trend is the same for all the observed surface structures , it is instructive to note some important variations .",
    "in particular , the structure with an oxygen vacancy shows a noticeably smaller exponential factor .",
    "additionally the surface state charge density falls much lower than the total charge density than is seen in other surface structures .",
    "this shows that surface states are less dominant in an oxygen vacancy structure than in other common @xmath1 surface configurations .",
    "this results is of practical interest in explaining the behavior of reduced @xmath1 surfaces , where oxygen vacancy structures dominate the charge  voltage response.@xcite",
    "semiconductor  electrolyte interfaces encompass a multitude of applications at the frontier of solid state physics and photoelectrochemistry .",
    "we have presented a method to integrate first - principles calculations of surface state energies with the mott  schottky model of band bending in semiconductors .",
    "we have validated our method on several different surfaces of rutile @xmath1(110 ) and si/@xmath0(110 ) .",
    "our simulations show conclusive agreement with experiment and provide a molecular - level understanding of the experimentally observed instability of silicon electrodes in water , suggesting a possible equilibrium structure for silicon  water interface consisting of a surface layer of @xmath0 for the equilibration of the bulk and interfacial fermi levels .",
    "this method is well positioned to examine the low - potential regime where surface state charges dominate the electrical response of the electrode in a manner not capture by the continnum mott ",
    "schottky theory alone .",
    "future work will focus on extending the method to implement and distribute robust algorithms that self - consistently determine the equilibrium distribution of charge between the bulk of the semiconductor and the surface states using a variational method relying of the free energy expression developed in this work .",
