    "in recent years , extragalactic surveys have revolutionized our view of the high - redshift universe , showing that the redshift range @xmath0 witnessed an extraordinary transformation in the demographics of starburst and agn activity in galaxies .",
    "the factors that drove these changes are however unclear .",
    "consequently , the properties of large samples of sources are the current driving force behind modern extragalactic surveys ( e.g. lonsdale et al . 2003 ; eales et al . 2010 ; oliver et al . 2010 ) .",
    "however , either most of the sources in these surveys are too faint for spectroscopic observations or it is not cost and time effective to acquire large spectroscopic redshift samples using the current facilities .",
    "photometric techniques provide an excellent tool for estimating redshifts , essential for statistical studies of the galaxies properties and evolution with only a fraction of the observing time required by spectroscopic surveys .",
    "these techniques are faster and can estimate redshifts beyond the spectroscopic limit with the main handicap of possessing larger errors than spectroscopic techniques . in order to minimize these statistical errors :",
    "i ) more bands are needed to be included in the photometric computation ii ) optical spectroscopic redshifts have to be used to calibrate and validate the photometric redshift codes .",
    "+ in this paper we use the efosc2 on the 3.6 m eso telescope to obtain optical spectroscopy of galaxies selected from the swire - cdfs in order to validate our photometric redshift techniques across a wide redshift range , thus allowing more accurate determinations for the whole swire catalogue .",
    "in addition , we present the optical spectra and mir properties of a sample of lirgs detected as part of our follow - up .",
    "infrared luminous objects at @xmath1 are of great importance since they lie at the proposed peak of global starburst activity .",
    "they may well be related to the famous sub - mm galaxy population ( eg .",
    "chapman et al . 2003 ) and be connected to the origin of the cosmic infrared background ( puget et al .",
    "many questions remain about this population , including the role of agn in their prodigious luminosities , what their descendants are in the local universe , and what their broader role is in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "some have claimed , for example , that such far - ir luminous objects can only be incorporated into our general understanding of galaxy formation if they have stellar initial mass functions ( imfs ) skewed to high masses ( baugh et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the targets for our efosc2 run were selected from the available multi - wavelength data in the swire - cdfs field ( lonsdale et al .",
    "target lists were prepared from the then latest version of the swire photometric redshift catalogue ( rowan - robinson et al .",
    "2005 ) , selecting 24@xmath2 m sources with @xmath3 .",
    "top priority was given to sources which were of u / lirg status based on their then estimated photometric redshifts and sed template fits .",
    "in total we targeted 12 prime sources in six pointings .",
    "the remaining slits were assigned to adjacent serendipitous 24@xmath2 m sources .",

    "this requirement limits the number of our sample to 31 .",
    "even if the larger wavelength difference between 8 and 24@xmath2 m makes the interpretation of the mips / irac color - color plots more complicated , all the qso fitted sources lie within the agn region ( right of the red line ) .",

    "we present the optical spectra of 34 sources within swire - cdfs , observed using efosc-2 in mos mode on the eso 3.6 m telescope .",
    "we have compared the observed spectroscopic redshifts values to those estimated using our photoz methods and the agreement is very good especially in the case of galaxies . with respect to qsos photoz agreement and taking into consideration",
    "the problems photoz methods face when dealing with quasars , our sample is too small to extract safe results . among our sources we found 6 lirgs , 5 ulirgs and 1 hlirg .",

    "all the broad line objects in our sample are fitted with a qso optical template and show evidence of a strong dust torus component in the mir in excellent agreement with mir color - color plots . in the case of narrow emission line objects ,",
    "based on emission diagnostic diagrams for the 15 sources with the necessary lines , we found 6 pure star - forming galaxies , 3 seyfert galaxies , 6 composite objects of which 3 appear as star - forming objects and 3 as liners based on the [ _ sii_]/_h@xmath4 _ vs [ _ oiii_]/_h@xmath22 _ diagram .",
