    "the upper boundary of the integration is given by @xmath21 .",
    "the function @xmath22 stands for the gluon density whereas the flavour singlet and flavour non - singlet combinations of the quark densities are given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively . in the above expressions the charges of the light quark and the heavy quark",
    "are denoted by @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath27 stands for the number of light quarks and @xmath28 denotes the mass factorization scale , which we choose to be equal to the renormalization scale .",
    "the latter shows up in the running coupling constant defined by @xmath29 .",
    "the heavy quark coefficient functions are denoted by @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath32 ; @xmath33 .",
    "the distinction between them can be traced back to the different photon - parton production processes from which they originate .",
    "the functions @xmath30 are attributed to the reactions where the virtual photon couples to the light quark , whereas the @xmath31 originate from the reactions where the virtual photon couples to the heavy quark .",
    "hence @xmath30 and @xmath31 in ( 5 ) are multiplied by @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "the superscripts ns and s on the heavy quark coefficient functions refer to flavour non - singlet and flavour singlet respectively .",
    "furthermore the singlet quark coefficient functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be split into non - singlet and purely singlet ( ps ) parts , i.e .",
    ", @xmath38 @xmath39 with @xmath40 in all orders of perturbation theory .    in @xcite",
    "the heavy quark coefficient functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 have been exactly calculated up to @xmath41 .",
    "expanding them in a power series in @xmath42 they receive contributions from the following parton subprocesses @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45 for reaction ( 9 ) one has to include the virtual gluon corrections to the born process ( 8) . the contributions from ( 8) and ( 9 ) to the heavy quark coefficient functions are denoted by @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "the parton subprocess ( 10 ) has two different production mechanisms .",
    "the first one is given by the bethe - heitler process ( see figs .",
    "5a,5b in @xcite ) leading to @xmath48 and the second one can be attributed to the compton reaction ( see figs .",
    "5c,5d in @xcite ) .",
    "notice that @xmath49 and @xmath50 are zero through order @xmath41 .",
    "then , from ( 6 ) , one infers that @xmath51 .",
    "finally we want to make the remark that there are no interference terms between the bethe - heitler and the compton reactions in ( 10 ) if one integrates over all final state momenta .",
    "the complexity of the second order heavy quark coefficient functions prohibits publishing them in an analytic form , except for @xmath52 , which is given in appendix a of @xcite , so that they are only available in large computer programs @xcite , involving two - dimensional integrations . to shorten the long running time needed for the computation of the structure functions in ( 5 ) we have tabulated the coefficient functions in the form of a two dimensional array in the variables @xmath53 and @xmath54 in a different computer program @xcite .",
    "these variables are defined by @xmath55 however when @xmath56 ( @xmath0 ) numerical instabilities appear so that it is desirable to have analytic expressions for the heavy quark coefficient functions in that region .",
    "moreover it turns out that for @xmath57 the asymptotic expressions for @xmath58 ( 9 ) and @xmath59 ( 10 ) approach the exact ones so that the former can be used for charm production at the hera collidier provided @xmath60 @xmath61 ( @xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore one can use these asymptotic formulae in the context of the variable flavour number scheme as has been explained in @xcite .",
    "we will now explain how the asymptotic form @xmath64 of the heavy quark coefficient functions @xmath31 , @xmath30 ( 5 ) can be derived using the renormalization group and the operator product expansion ( ope ) techniques .",
    "using these techniques one can avoid the computation of the cumbersome feynman integrals and phase space integrals which arise in the calculation of the processes in ( 8) - ( 10 ) . in the limit @xmath0 the heavy quark coefficient functions behave logarithmically as @xmath65 with a similar expression for l@xmath66 .",
    "the above large logarithms originate from collinear divergences which arise when @xmath1 is kept fixed and @xmath67 .",
    "as has been shown in @xcite each fixed order term in expression ( 12 ) can be written as @xmath68 where the power of @xmath69 has to match on the left and right hand sides .",
    "there is a similar expression for @xmath30 ( @xmath70 ; @xmath71 ) .",
    "notice that we have suppressed the dependence on the scaling variable @xmath72 in ( 12 ) and the convolution symbol @xmath73 is defined by @xmath74    the light quark and gluon coefficient functions @xmath75 have been calculated up to order @xmath41 in @xcite .",
    "the operator matrix elements ( ome s ) @xmath76 are now also known up to the same order in perturbation theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "they are defined by @xmath77 where @xmath78 represent the local operators which show up in the operator product expansion of the two electromagnetic currents which appear in the calculation of the process ( 1 ) .",
    "notice that the ome s in ( 15 ) are finite which means that all renormalizations and mass factorizations have already been carried out .",
    "the last operation is needed because of the collinear divergences which appear in the ome s when the external on - mass - shell massless quarks and gluons are coupled to internal massless quanta .",
    "the ultraviolet and collinear divergences are regulated by using the method of @xmath79-dimensional regularization .",
    "the removal of these divergences has been done in the @xmath80-scheme . for the computation of the heavy quark coefficient functions @xmath46 ( 8) @xmath47 ( 9 ) we need the ome s @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively , which are given by the feynman graphs in figs.1,2 of @xcite .",
    "the bethe - heitler coefficient functions @xmath48 ( 10 ) requires the calculation of @xmath83 whereas for the compton coefficient function @xmath84 ( 10 ) one has to compute @xmath85 the results for these ome s can be found in appendix c of @xcite .",
    "substitution of @xmath76 and @xmath75 in ( 13 ) leads to the asymptotic heavy quark coefficient functions which are presented in appendix d of @xcite .",
    "we are now interested to find out at which values of @xmath54 ( 11 ) or @xmath1 the asymptotic coefficient functions approach the exact ones computed in @xcite and @xcite . for that purpose",
    "we define the ratio @xmath86 which is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 stand for the exact @xcite , @xcite and asymptotic @xcite heavy quark coefficient functions respectively .",
    "choosing @xmath90 and the range @xmath91 , we have plotted as an example @xmath92 in fig.1 and @xmath93 in fig.2 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the reason that we have chosen these two ratios is that the coefficient functions @xmath96 and @xmath58 ( 9 ) constitute the      bulk of the radiative corrections to the born reaction ( 8) . from fig.1",
    "we infer that @xmath97 and @xmath98 coincide when @xmath99 and there is essentially no difference between the ratios for @xmath100 and @xmath101 . in the case of @xmath102 and @xmath103",
    "( see fig.2 ) the above @xmath54-value is much smaller and both coefficient functions coincide when @xmath104 , which is quite insensitive to the values chosen for @xmath72 .",
    "the reason why the convergence of @xmath105 to one is so slow in comparison to @xmath106 is unclear .",
    "apparently the logarithmic terms in @xmath97 start to dominate the coefficient functions at much larger values of @xmath54 than is the case for @xmath102 .",
    "a similar observation has been made for @xmath48 .",
    "the small value found for @xmath107 in the case of @xmath108 is very interesting for charm production where @xmath109 can be measured with much higher accuracy than @xmath110 .",
    "since @xmath58 dominates the radiative corrections to @xmath109 one can state that for @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114 the exact coefficient functions can be replaced by their asymptotic ones .",
    "however before one can draw definite conclusions about the dominance of the terms @xmath115 on the level of the structure functions ones first to convolute the heavy quark coefficient functions with the parton densities  ( see ( 5 ) ) . this will be done in future work .",
    "if it turns out that the above logarithms also dominate @xmath116 , in particular for @xmath117 , then these terms have to be resummed using the renormalization group equations .",
    "this is done using the variable flavour number scheme approach @xcite .",
    "one of the features of this method is that one has to define a charm density in the proton which is a convolution of the ome s @xmath118 ( 15 ) and the light parton densities @xmath119 and @xmath120 in ( 5 ) .",
    "hence for @xmath121 the charm quark behaves like a light parton provided the large logarithmic terms dominate the proton structure functions in ( 5 ) .      9 e. laenen , s. riemersma , j. smith and w. l. van neerven , nucl . phys .",
