    "the wrapped fukaya category @xmath4 of a symplectic manifold @xmath0 with convex contact boundary , introduced in @xcite , is of increasing importance in both symplectic topology ( topology of stein manifolds @xcite , the nearby lagrangian conjecture @xcite ) and homological mirror symmetry @xcite .",
    "the wrapped category is a version of the fukaya category which incorporates both closed lagrangian submanifolds and non - compact lagrangians modelled on a legendrian cone at infinity , and which therefore takes into account the dynamics of the reeb flow at the contact boundary . incorporating non - compact lagrangians",
    "typically leads to a substantial increase in complexity ; the wrapped floer cohomology of a cotangent fibre is isomorphic to the homology of the based loop space @xcite , in particular it is of infinite rank .    despite its increasing prominence , there are surprisingly few cases in which the wrapped category has been computed .",
    "essentially complete descriptions are known for cotangent bundles @xcite and for punctured spheres @xcite , whilst we have partial information for certain stein manifolds ( given as lefschetz fibrations @xcite or plumbings @xcite ) , and some general structural information concerning the behaviour of the category under weinstein surgery @xcite .",
    "following abouzaid , we study the open - closed string map @xmath5 from hochschild homology to symplectic cohomology .",
    "this is compatible with the decomposition of the wrapped category into subcategories indexed by the spectrum @xmath6 of quantum multiplication by the first chern class , @xmath7 ( we work throughout with coefficients in the novikov field @xmath8 defined in [ subsection novikov ring ] ) .",
    "we prove two main results .",
    "[ theorem introduction 2 ] let @xmath9 be a full subcategory . if @xmath10 hits an invertible element in @xmath11 , then @xmath12 split - generates @xmath13 .",
    "the theorem subsumes two statements .",
    "first , we extend abouzaid s generation criterion @xcite from the exact to the monotone case : as discussed further below in section [ subsection linear vs quadratic hams ] , this is a fairly substantial undertaking .",
    "second , we prove that @xmath1 is a symplectic cohomology module map , so hitting any invertible in a given eigensummand is as good as hitting the identity .",
    "the module structure was observed independently , in the exact case , by ganatra @xcite , and the underlying @xmath14-module structure is used in forthcoming work @xcite on generation in the closed case .",
    "our second main result studies a basic compatibility of @xmath1-maps with the maps induced by functors of fukaya categories arising from lagrangian correspondences .",
    "consider a monotone symplectic manifold @xmath15 , a convex monotone symplectic manifold @xmath0 , and a closed monotone lagrangian correspondence @xmath16 .",
    "composing monotone orientable lagrangians @xmath17 with the correspondence @xmath18 gives rise to a set @xmath19 . to ensure that @xmath20 is a monotone orientable lagrangian",
    ", one needs to ensure that the composition @xmath21 is transverse and embedded , and that @xmath20 is monotone .",
    "call @xmath18 _ very good _ if this is the case for all @xmath22 .",
    "we will discuss the condition that @xmath18 is `` very good '' in section [ subsection phi lands in fuk e ] . to achieve this a priori condition for all possible @xmath22 in such a general context",
    ", one would need to impose a strong condition on @xmath18 .",
    "for instance , it holds if @xmath18 is the total space of a fibre bundle over @xmath15 , the projection @xmath23 is injective , and @xmath24 has torsion kernel .",
    "however , in practice , for the purposes of proving a generation result ( such as via corollary [ corollary introduction 1 ] below ) it suffices that @xmath18 is `` very good '' just with respect to a selected collection of lagrangians @xmath17 whose compositions with @xmath18 one hopes will split - generate @xmath4 ( or a summand thereof ) .",
    "indeed , one applies our machinery to the subcategory generated by the selected @xmath22 and the subcategory generated by their compositions @xmath25 .",
    "if one can deduce that @xmath1 restricted to the second subcategory hits an invertible element , then by theorem [ theorem introduction 2 ] those compositions @xmath25 actually split - generate the whole category .",
    "let @xmath26 be the open - closed map from the ordinary fukaya category of @xmath15 to small quantum cohomology .",
    "[ theorem introduction 1 ] for monotone @xmath15 , monotone convex @xmath0 and very good @xmath16 as above , and for @xmath27 , there is a commutative diagram @xmath28 \\ar@{->}_{\\mathrm{oc}_b}[d ] &   \\mathrm{hh}_*({\\mathcal{w}(e ) } ) \\ar@{->}^{\\mathrm{oc}_e}[d ] \\\\",

    "the possibility of incorporating the bulk deformation class @xmath27 is essential in applications .",
    "for instance , if @xmath37 is the total space of a negative line bundle over @xmath15 , the undeformed composite map @xmath38 typically vanishes identically for degree reasons , whilst the deformed map can still be non - trivial .",
    "the diagram allows further deformations ( for instance bulk deformations of @xmath39 and the corresponding @xmath40-map ) , although for simplicity we do not state the results in the more general case .    en route to proving theorem [ theorem introduction 1 ]",
    ", we also construct for general monotone convex @xmath0 the commutative diagram @xmath41 \\ar@{->}_{\\mathrm{oc}_e}[d ] & \\mathrm{hh}_*({\\mathcal{w}(e ) } ) \\ar@{->}^{\\mathrm{oc}_e}[d ] \\\\",

    "the analogue of theorem [ theorem introduction 2 ] also holds for the compact category ( namely : if @xmath43 is a full subcategory for which @xmath10 hits an invertible element in @xmath44 , then @xmath12 split - generates @xmath45 ) .",
    "the following is an illustrative application of the acceleration diagram and the generation theorem for the compact category .",
    "let @xmath0 be a convex toric fano variety .",
    "let @xmath46 be a critical point of the superpotential with non - zero critical value @xmath47 .",
    "if the generalized eigensummand @xmath48 is @xmath49-dimensional then the lagrangian torus @xmath50 corresponding to @xmath51 split - generates @xmath52 and @xmath53 , in particular @xmath53 is cohomologically finite .",
    "there are two known constructions of the wrapped category of a stein manifold , which take advantage of hamiltonian functions which have either linear slope at infinity or which grow quadratically on the contact cone . in either set - up one must deal with the fact that products in floer theory are most naturally defined as maps @xmath54 which involve ( at least ) multiples of a given hamiltonian function ( used to displace @xmath22 slightly to achieve self - transversality ) , and the fact that the floer complex on the right of may not be isomorphic , at chain level , to the factors on the left , even if all the @xmath55 co - incide . in the setting of linear slope hamiltonians , as in @xcite ,",
    "one defines the morphism groups via a  telescope \" ( homotopy direct limit ) construction , @xmath56 $ ] , involving arbitrarily large multiples of a fixed hamiltonian of linear slope ; whilst in the setting of quadratic hamiltonians , one uses a rescaling trick ( conjugating by a suitable multiple of the liouville flow ) to identify the output chain complex in with the input complexes appearing on the left .",
    "unfortunately , the rescaling trick is only available in the exact case , with no analogue for a general monotone convex symplectic manifold .",
    "for instance , for negative line bundles @xmath57 , the liouville flow does not extend across the zero - section .",
    "on the other hand , abouzaid proved the generation criterion using quadratic hamiltonians , accordingly restricted to the exact case .",
    "similar remarks apply to ganatra s discussion of the module structure of the open - closed string map .",
    "the proof of each of the module structure of the @xmath1-map and the generation criterion in the telescope model is surprisingly involved : the necessary modifications are numerous and non - trivial , and constitute one of the main contributions of this paper .",
    "at the cost of appealing to kuranishi spaces or polyfolds , the arguments we give for theorem [ theorem introduction 2 ] would adapt to hold for general convex symplectic manifolds , without any monotonicity assumptions .      whilst this paper is largely conceived as foundational ,",
    "we include two illustrative applications of theorems [ theorem introduction 2 ] and [ theorem introduction 1 ] .    1 .   the total space of the line bundle @xmath2 is monotone whenever @xmath58 .",
    "when @xmath59 , @xmath60 is known explicitly through work of the first author @xcite . making heavy use of the module structure and compatibility with eigenvalue splittings , we compute the open - closed string map explicitly , and prove that the wrapped category is cohomologically finite , split - generated by closed lagrangian submanifolds . by contrast , in all previous situations in which the wrapped fukaya category has been computed ( punctured spheres , certain plumbings , cotangent bundles ) , it either vanishes or is cohomologically infinite .",
    "the special case of @xmath61 had been studied previously , compare to ( * ? ? ? * sec.4.4 ) .",
    "the quilt diagram in theorem [ theorem introduction 1 ] can be interpreted as a  transfer - of - generation \" criterion , enabling one to show that lifts of lagrangians under a very good correspondence define split - generators in terms of geometry on the domain of the correspondence . as a simple example ,",
    "we show that if a finite group @xmath62 acts freely by symplectomorphisms on a closed monotone symplectic manifold @xmath15 with quotient @xmath63 , and if @xmath64 hits an invertible element when restricted to the subcategory generated by a collection of lagrangians @xmath65 , then @xmath66 are split - generators for @xmath67 and their preimages @xmath68 split - generate @xmath39 .",
    "it is not hard to envisage other applications . in a series of papers ,",
    "abouzaid @xcite proved that the cotangent fibre @xmath69 generates the wrapped category @xmath70 of the cotangent bundle of a closed manifold equipped with its canonical exact symplectic structure @xmath71 . from a dynamical point of view",
    ", there is a great deal of interest in the convex non - exact manifolds defined by cotangent bundles equipped with magnetic forms , i.e. by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is some closed but not necessarily exact form pulled back from the base .",
    "it seems likely that our results can be used to show a cotangent fibre still generates the wrapped category after turning on the magnetic potential .    in another direction",
    ", morse - bott degenerations provide one class of examples to which theorem [ theorem introduction 1 ] can be applied , cf .",
    "subsection [ subsection morse bott degenerations ] , either to give information on the @xmath74 map , or conversely , when the @xmath74 map is known , to constrain the behaviour of quilt maps on quantum cohomology , which are notoriously hard to compute in general .",
    "theorem [ theorem introduction 1 ] can also be considered a prototype for the more difficult case in which the correspondence @xmath18 is itself allowed to be non - compact .",
    "whilst quilt theory is not manifestly sufficiently developed at present to allow such a generalisation , ganatra s recent work @xcite takes many steps in the necessary direction .",
    "a commutative diagram of the shape presented in theorem [ theorem introduction 1 ] , but entwining open - closed maps on wrapped categories , would be of obvious interest in mirror symmetry .      local calabi - yau s ( total spaces of canonical bundles over fano varieties ) are well - known testing grounds for many aspects of mirror symmetry , with rich symplectic topology @xcite .",
    "monotone negative line bundles form another class of `` local symplectic manifolds '' , which arise naturally in symplectic birational geometry , cf . @xcite . as remarked above , whilst in known computations in the stein case the wrapped category @xmath4 either vanishes or is extremely complicated , the line bundles @xmath75 show qualitatively different behaviour .",
    "[ conjecture introduction 1 ] let @xmath76 be a monotone negative line bundle .",
    "if @xmath40 hits an invertible element , then @xmath4 is cohomologically finite .",
    "conjecture [ conjecture introduction 1 ] asserts an open - string analogue of a recent result of the first author @xcite , who gave an explicit description of the symplectic cohomology of a general negative line bundle @xmath0 in terms of gromov - witten theory on @xmath15 .",
    "the symplectic cohomology is a quotient of quantum cohomology , so of finite rank .",
    "the hypothesis that @xmath40 hits an invertible is a version of a `` resolution of the diagonal '' statement for @xmath15 . using the cyclicity of the fukaya category @xcite , and recent work of abouzaid - fukaya - oh - ohta - ono @xcite ,",
    "it is equivalent to the injectivity of the closed - open string map , a natural ring map @xmath77 the condition that @xmath40 hits @xmath78 is known to hold in several monotone examples : it holds for toric fano varieties @xmath15 by @xcite , and it holds for products @xmath79 if it holds for the @xmath80 by @xcite .",
    "there are also non - toric examples , for instance it holds for the fano varieties given by a quadric and a complete intersection of two even - dimensional quadrics @xcite .",
    "monotonicity of the line bundle @xmath0 is a fairly strong requirement : for simply connected @xmath15 , any such @xmath0 arises as the line bundle with first chern class @xmath81 , where the first chern class of @xmath15 is a non - trivial multiple @xmath82 of a primitive class @xmath83 , and where the multiple @xmath84 satisfies @xmath85 .",
    "typical examples are the bundles @xmath86 for @xmath87 , the square root of the canonical bundle for any spin fano variety , or appropriate bundles over the twistor space of a hyperbolic @xmath88-manifold with @xmath89 ( * ? ? ?",

    "for instance , if @xmath15 and @xmath0 are ( monotone ) toric , direct computations with the landau - ginzburg superpotential of @xmath0 imply that the unique toric fibre with non - trivial floer cohomology is indeed the image , under @xmath18 , of the corresponding unique monotone toric fibre in @xmath15 , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "any precise categorical statement of the relationship between floer theory in @xmath15 and in @xmath0 , however , is necessarily rather involved . because of monotonicity , the fukaya categories @xmath39 and @xmath4 both split into collections of mutually orthogonal subcategories indexed by eigenvalues of the quantum product action of the first chern class .",
    "consideration of the behaviour of these eigenvalues under composition with a lagrangian correspondence , cf .",
    "section [ subsection additivity of the m0 values ] , shows that the image of @xmath39 in @xmath4 under a functor defined by @xmath18 will account for only particular idempotent summands , usually at most one . in the toric examples , whilst the monotone lagrangian tori of interest in @xmath15 and @xmath0 are superficially matched up by the correspondence @xmath18 , if one looks more closely at the local systems with which these tori must be equipped for floer cohomology to be non - vanishing , discrepancies start to appear . to hope to obtain the whole of @xmath4 functorially from @xmath18 ,",

    "given a point @xmath360 of @xmath22 , all holomorphic discs bounding @xmath22 satisfying @xmath361 must lie entirely in a compact region of @xmath0 determined by @xmath360 .",

    "so in this case we can not deform geodesics to avoid @xmath802 since then they would never reach @xmath194 .",
    "so instead we apply a similar trick to step 7 ( figure [ figure oc_qhsupport000 ] ) : instead of @xmath800 we always use the disc @xmath930 with radius @xmath946 when deforming geodesics ( we will explain later why this time we square the hyperbolic distance between the two punctures ) .",
    "notice @xmath930 shrinks to zero if @xmath745 approaches the puncture @xmath194 , whereas it coincides with @xmath802 whenever @xmath745 lies outside of @xmath947 ( and , since it is a hyperbolic disc , if @xmath745 approaches @xmath181 it will shrink to a point when viewed as a euclidean disc ) .",
    "observe the second and third pictures in figure [ figure oc_qhsupport0000 ] : we deform ( if necessary ) any geodesic which connects @xmath194 to a boundary puncture so that it avoids the disc @xmath930 by moving along @xmath931 ( with the usual clockwise / anticlockwise convention , in particular for the geodesic @xmath938 from @xmath194 to @xmath181 we stipulate that the deformed geodesic goes around @xmath931 clockwise : this does not break any symmetry in the boundary punctures since @xmath181 already broke that symmetry by being the distinguished boundary puncture which receives the module input ) .",
    "the reason for making @xmath934 decrease quadratically in the hyperbolic distance between @xmath194 and @xmath745 , is to ensure that if we fix the slope of a straight line geodesic @xmath948 connecting @xmath194 to a boundary point @xmath109 of the disc , then @xmath948 will not intersect @xmath930 when @xmath745 is sufficiently close to zero , and thus @xmath948 does not need to be deformed .",
    "therefore , in a @xmath49-family , if @xmath745 converges to @xmath194 , and @xmath109 converges to @xmath949 , then the deformations of @xmath948 will converge to the undeformed geodesic @xmath950 .",
    "this also holds in the borderline case @xmath951 since @xmath930 shrinks to a point as @xmath952 .",
    "this convergence result is necessary to ensure that when counting floer solutions on these domains , and @xmath745 bubbles off to @xmath194 , then the resulting domain ( without the bubble ) is the domain used for the @xmath1-map , namely where geodesics are undeformed straight line segments from @xmath194 to a boundary puncture .",
    "let us call @xmath953 the map which counts isolated solutions of @xmath679 for the above domains with the indicated auxiliary data . now consider a @xmath49-family of such solutions .",

    "@xmath745 does not converge to one of the punctures , but a subset of the boundary punctures converges to a boundary point @xmath764 giving rise to a disc bubble .",

    "@xmath745 does not converge to one of the punctures , but there is a twice - punctured sphere that bubbles off at @xmath194 .",
    "this degeneration is counted by @xmath957 composed with @xmath953 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the counts of these degenerations correspond to the equation @xmath958 which shows that @xmath953 is the chain homotopy required to prove that on cohomology @xmath1 preserves the @xmath596-action .",
    "the theorem now follows from steps 1 - 8 .",
    "in particular , observe that if @xmath959 is an @xmath213-module homomorphism , then @xmath960 is compatible with splittings into generalized eigenspacs of any @xmath961 : @xmath962 implies @xmath963 .",

    "a classical fact about closed fano varieties is that quantum cohomology is isomorphic to the jacobian ring of the superpotential .",
