    "in the last decade or so , it has become clear that the energy expended in large flares on the sun is dominated not by the thermal radiation in the x - ray and euv regimes that we have become so accustomed to studying , but by the energy of the coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) that are associated with the magnetic field re - organization , followed closely by the uv - optical `` white light '' continuum .",
    "studies of the timing and location of cmes have revealed that the fraction of flares accompanied by cmes increases with flare energy , until x - class ( peak goes 18    flux @xmath0  w  m@xmath1 as seen at earth ) when essentially all flares are accompanied by a cme ( e.g. , @xcite ; see figure  [ f : evlac ] ) .    at 4.6 billion years",

    "the cme mass loss rate we have derived , integrated over a few hundred million years when the sun would have been very active , would appear to be enough to solve the problem ( see @xcite for further discussion ) !    on the down side , such high mass loss rates would produce winds opaque to radio waves and are then at odds with radio detections indicating circumstellar radio transparency ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "similarly , in the lower panel , the vector corresponding to the equivalence of x - ray and kinetic energy is shown : the mean cme kinetic energy is 200 times that of the radiated goes band x - ray energy . for stars",
    "whose x - rays are all flares , and are saturated at @xmath31 , it is straightforward to see we would need @xmath32 to power the cmes .",
    "since the laws of physics have to intervene somewhere ( though it often appears the laws of astrophysics must be fundamentally different ) , there must have been some impropriety committed in extrapolating the solar data to very active stars .",
