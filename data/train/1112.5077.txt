    "the dynamic properties of the vortex state have been studied extensively with experiments , theory and numerical simulations , with renewed interest after the discovery of cuprate superconductors .",
    "complex vortex matters have been identified , and their properties theoretically investigated @xcite . in face of the enormous amount of progress in the field , the simplest , free flux flow ( fff ) has received much less attention , despite its direct connection to the physics in the vortex core .",
    "the discovery of iron - based superconductors , and the revamped interest in superconductor / ferromagnet hybrid structures make this issue even more interesting than before .",
    "experiments on the vortex motion resistivity often compare the flux - flow state to the prediction of the bardeen - stephen ( bs ) model , which predicts @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the normal state resistivity , @xmath3 is the field induction , @xmath4 is the temperature - dependent upper critical field and @xmath5 .",
    "this behavior is often observed , apart the field region approaching @xmath4 , where additional effects , e.g. the suppression of the condensate , increase @xmath0 above @xmath6 .    in this paper",
    "we study the flux flow resistivity @xmath0 in sfs trilayers using high - frequencies currents , of the order of several ghz .",
    "the motivation resides in the possibility to access the genuine flux - flow state ( defined as irrelevance of pinning and free motion of vortices , hindered solely by the viscous force ) without the need for large currents .",
    "in fact , motion of vortices is a complex matter that involves interaction with defects , relation with the vortex lattice elastic moduli , and the nature of the vortex core ( responsible for the viscous drag ) .",
    "however , high frequency measurements prove useful in simplifying the physical problem : at several ghz vortices oscillate over distances that are typically much shorter than the vortex lattice constant and of the defect average distance @xcite .",
    "thus , they remain mostly near their equilibrium position . in most cases",
    "one can apply safely the mean - field theory developed for vortex dynamics @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a single formulation is able to describe many of the mentioned theories .",
    "in fact , the vortex motion resistivity can be described by the following expression @xcite : @xmath7 where the resistivity @xmath0 represents the free flux flow value , reached in the high frequency limit in which vortices experiences only the dissipative viscous drag , @xmath8 is a characteristic frequency and the dimensionless parameter @xmath9 is a measure of thermal activation phenomena . for the purposes of this paper , we explicitly note that , when the measuring frequency @xmath10 , @xmath11 , irrespective of pinning and creep ( whose relevance are within @xmath8 and @xmath12 ) . since in most superconductors",
    "the characteristic frequencies lay at or below the microwave frequencies , an experimental investigation at several ghz is a powerful tool to access the genuine @xmath0 .",
    "nb / pd@xmath13ni@xmath14/nb trilayers have been grown by uhv dc magnetron sputtering at room temperature , as reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "samples were grown onto sapphire substrates to avoid the deleterious contribution of semiconducting substrates to the microwave measurements @xcite .",
    "the nominal thickness , calibrated with the deposition rate , was as follows : all trilayers had nb thickness @xmath15=15 nm for both upper and lower layers . in this work",
    "we concentrate on the samples with pdni thickness @xmath16= 1 , 2 , 9 nm . dc resistivity measurements in samples grown on the same conditions consistently yielded a constant normal state @xmath17 cm for temperatures @xmath18k .",
    "critical temperatures of 6.25 k , 5.1 k and 4.25 k for the samples with @xmath16= 1 , 2 , 9 nm , respectively , were evaluated by the disappearance of the microwave signal and were consistent with dc measurements with a criterion of 90% of the normal state .",
    "we have used two different setups in order to measure the microwave response of sfs heterostructures .",
    "the corbino disk setup was used to obtain @xmath0 from the frequency dependence of @xmath19 between 2 and 20 ghz , in sfs structures with @xmath201 and 2 nm . the setup and",
    "the measuring technique has been extensively described previously @xcite , and we report here only the results . in this context , it is important to stress that the swept - frequency data directly yielded a characteristic frequency @xmath8 which decreased with @xmath16 , and was as low as 4 ghz in the sample with @xmath202 nm .",
    "thus , we have chosen to perform measurements in trilayers with @xmath21 and 9 nm with a more sensitive dielectric resonator at the operating frequency @xmath22 8 ghz .    2 nm at @xmath234.08 k and in zero field .",
    "( c ) field - variation of the resonance curve.,width=321 ]    the dielectric resonator ( dr ) is based upon a rutile ( tio@xmath24 ) cylinder , of approximate dimensions 2.73 mm ( height ) @xmath25 3.9 mm ( dia . ) , enclosed in a ofhc cu cylindrical enclosure .",
    "the dielectric rod is placed onto the sample , which in turn is partially masked by a thin metal mask with a circular hole in order to maintain the azimuthal symmetry , and it is in close contact with the bottom wall of the enclosure .",
    "the high permittivity of rutile ( @xmath26100 , for a detailed characterization see @xcite ) ensures that the evanescent electromagnetic field drops quickly to zero out of the dielectric .",
    "the dr works in transmission with very weak coupling , thus making corrections of the directly measured quality factor @xmath27 unnecessary @xcite .",
    "the measurements here reported are all in the linear regime , as directly checked by us by varying the incident power over a factor of 10 without observing any variation in the response .",
    "a sketch of the resonator is reported in fig.[figresonator]a .",
    "the resonator was placed in a he - flow superconducting cryomagnet , and magnetic fields up and over the upper critical field @xmath4 could be applied perpendicular to the sample plane . at fixed temperatures ( stability @xmath28k ) the field was slowly swept . at each magnetic field",
    "the resonance curve was measured with a vector network analyzer and fitted to a lorentzian , yielding @xmath27 and the resonance frequency @xmath29 .",
    "all samples were thin enough to ensure the realization of the thin - film approximation in the microwave measurements @xcite .",
    "thus , the field variation of the complex resistivity @xmath30 was obtained from @xmath27 and @xmath29 as : @xmath31\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is a geometrical factor and @xmath33 is the total thickness of the sample .",
    "the reduced thickness implies that screening is vanishing small approaching @xmath34 , so that data close to the normal state can not be measured with the present technique .",
    "we note that @xmath32 and @xmath35 act as mere scaling factors . in figure [ figresonator ]",
    "we report the evolution of the resonance curve upon sweeping the magnetic field .",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath29 change with the field ( the resonance curve broadens and the peak shifts ) , reflecting changes in @xmath36 and @xmath37 . from the application of eq.s ( [ eq",
    ": rhovm ] ) , ( [ eq : rhoexp ] ) and the procedure described in @xcite we found that , to a good approximation , @xmath38 ( being @xmath39 a lower limit for @xmath0 when the correction could be detected ) . for the purposes of this paper , we could safely take @xmath38 . in some samples and in a nb sample ( for reference ) we checked at several temperatures that the microwave resistivity as measured with the dr and the corbino disk yielded the same results .     vs. @xmath40 , at",
    "approximately the same reduced temperature @xmath41 for three trilayers with @xmath42 nm . continuous line : bs prediction , eq.([eq : rhobs ] ) , with @xmath43 .",
    "none of the samples follows the bs model .",
    "inset : enlargement at small reduced fields . ]",
    "in fig.[figrhoff ] we report the normalized flux flow resistivity in the three samples studied at similar reduced temperature @xmath41 , as a function of the reduced magnetic field .",
    "the sample with @xmath441 nm has been measured with the corbino disk . in this plot in reduced units",
    "one would expect a similar , if not the same , behavior for @xmath0 .",
    "however , despite the same reduced temperature , the three samples behave dramatically different .",
    "it is apparent that , with increasing @xmath16 , the field dependence of @xmath0 progressively changes curvature , from upward ( @xmath201 nm ) to downward ( @xmath45 nm ) .",
    "even more striking , the large difference between the samples with @xmath20 1 and 2 nm : a close analysis ( see the enlargement in the inset of fig . [ figrhoff ] ) shows that even at low fields there is no proportionality @xmath46 , thus invalidating the bs model in all the samples .",
    "we discuss first the sample at @xmath201 nm . first of all , it should be made clear that the upward curvature , and the fact that @xmath47 can not be ascribed to pinning or creep : the present measurements have been taken with the corbino disk , and the full frequency dependence of the real part of the resistivity has been recorded ( typical frequency sweeps , and fits by eq.([eq : rhovm ] ) , have been reported in @xcite ) .",
    "the upward curvature reflects an overestimate of @xmath0 by the bs model .",
    "we then compared the results to more refined theories for the ff .",
    "we compared the data with the microscopic theory by larkin and ovchinnikov ( lo ) @xcite , but were unable to obtain more than qualitative agreement in the low field and @xmath48 limit .",
    "however , we found that a full calculation within the time - dependent ginzburg - landau framework ( tdgl ) @xcite matched very well our data",
    ". the calculation yielded , for the normalized flux flow resistivity : @xmath49 where @xmath50 , as calculated in @xcite .",
    "the bs model is recovered for @xmath51 . in fig.[figrhoffgl ] we report the same data for the sample with @xmath201 nm as in fig.[figrhoff ] , together with the curves calculated on the basis of eq.([eq : rhoffgl ] ) for @xmath520.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 .",
    "to check further the agreement between the data and the tdgl expression , we measured @xmath0 at a different temperature .",
    "as can be seen , with the simple change of the value of @xmath4 , eq.([eq : rhoffgl ] ) fits the data at different temperature as well .     vs. @xmath53 , in the sample with @xmath201",
    "nm , at 5 k ( full dots , same data as in fig.[figrhoff ] ) and 3.58 k ( open diamonds ) .",
    "continuous line : tdgl calculation , eq.([eq : rhoffgl ] ) , with @xmath54 . by varying only the value of @xmath4",
    "the tdgl calculation fits also data at a different temperature . short - dash and long - dash lines exemplify the sensitivity of the tdgl calculation to the parameter @xmath55.,width=321 ]    while we can state that we found agreement between our @xmath0 data and a  conventional \" theory , so that at least in this respect the trilayer with very short @xmath16 behaves essentially like an ordinary superconductor , the same is not true for the trilayers with larger @xmath16 .",
    "we argue that the increasing @xmath16 induces a progressive crossover between a  conventional \" behavior and a novel flux flow regime .",
    "the data in the sample with @xmath209 nm exceed by far the bs expectation , indicating that _ additional _ losses are induced by the magnetic field .",
    "the emerging of this feature can be observed at low fields in the sample with @xmath202 nm ( see inset of fig.[figrhoff ] ) .",
    "while we have not yet an explanation of the phenomenon , we can speculate over a possible scenario .",
    "at very small @xmath16 the f layer acts simply to reduce @xmath34 ( with respect to a nb sample 30 nm thick , where @xmath567.5 k @xcite ) but leaving all the main superconducting features unaffected , including the spatial uniformity of the order parameter . with increasing @xmath16 ,",
    "the order parameter acquires a modulation across the trilayer ( connected to the observed oscillations of @xmath34 with @xmath16 @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic field may trigger this delicate state , inducing a relatively wide region where the order parameter is substantially depressed .",
    "the electromagnetic field , uniform along the thickness of thin films , would give a response as if part of the trilayer would be essentially normal ( effective thickness smaller than the geometrical thickness ) , and dissipation larger than expected would be observed .",
    "while this is at present only a speculation , it indicates that an extension of the measurements in samples with different @xmath16 , and possibly with different f materials , would be useful to clarify the anomalous flux - flow behavior here observed .",
    "we have studied the flux flow resistivity of nb / pdni / nb trilayers .",
    "we have found a conventional behavior of @xmath0 , different from the bardeem - stephen model but well described by a tdgl calculation , when the ferromagnetic thickness is extremely small . when the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer increases , @xmath0 exhibits a previously unreported field dependence .",
    "a peculiar feature is that it exceeds the bardeen - stephen value , @xmath57 , in almost the entire field range . a quantitative explanation of the phenomenon is not given at present .",
