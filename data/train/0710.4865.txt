    "the properties of the richardson model are correctly described via the bcs variational ansatz @xcite . however ,",
    "for finite numbers of particles , the situation is more complex .",
    "the actual solution then depends on the ensemble chosen , and for physically relevant systems the grand - canonical ensemble is not always the appropriate one . for example , nuclei have a fixed number of nucleons ; due to the typically large charging energy , experiments on ultra - small metallic grains are also performed at fixed number of electrons @xcite . in these cases a treatment based on the canonical ensemble would be more appropriate , precluding a bcs mean - field approach .",
    "moreover , dealing with a system in the mesoscopic regime precludes the use of quantum statistical mechanics , and one is thus forced to rely either on uncontrolled approximations , or nonperturbative methods .",
    "fortunately , richardson s hamiltonian ( [ bcsh ] ) is one of the theories for which an exact solution can be constructed in the canonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "this solution explains several interesting features of the mesoscopic physics of superconductors , complementing previous approximate treatments ( see the review [ ] ) .",
    "in particular it allowed to give a definitive answer to anderson s 1959 question @xcite : _ what is the size limit for a metallic grain to have superconducting properties ? _",

    "experiments typically give access to static or dynamical correlation functions , which are not easily obtained in this framework .",
    "richardson himself in 1965 @xcite derived a first exact expression for static correlation functions , which unfortunately has a degree of complexity that grows factorially with system size , and was therefore not suitable for actual calculations . in a significant development ,",
    "amico and osterloh @xcite proposed a new method ( based on a generalization of earlier work by sklyanin @xcite ) to write down such correlations explicitly .",
    "the complexity of this method was still factorial and all the numerical results were therefore limited to system sizes of up to 16 particles .",
    "a disadvantage of these methods is that all the eigenstates of the hamiltonian must be known to get the correlation functions .",

    "furthermore , in this approach only the knowledge of the ground - state wavefunction is required .",
    "surprisingly , this approach has not been used until now to obtain quantitative numerical results for the correlation functions , with the notable exception of the calculation of ground - state entanglement properties @xcite .    in this paper",

    "[ ] , rewriting all static correlation functions as sums over only @xmath10 determinants ( thereby reducing the complexity of the problem by a further factor of @xmath10 ) .",
    "we then provide analytical formulas for the physically relevant correlation functions , and evaluate them for some model hamiltonians .",
    "we stress that having reduced the complexity of the problem by this amount , correlation functions of systems with many more particles than before can be calculated on a simple computer . in this way we can describe the crossover from mesoscopic to macroscopic physics , going beyond previous results limited to fewer particles @xcite .",
