    "recent experiments have demonstrated the unique electronic properties of graphene sheets.@xcite these works point to a potential route to a new nanoelectronics paradigm based on an epitaxial graphene ( eg).@xcite for the purpose of this paper we define graphene as a single honeycomb layer of graphite regardless of stacking order . at the moment graphene is prepared either by mechanical exfoliation of flakes from a bulk graphite sample that are subsequently deposited on an insulating substrate@xcite or by sublimating si from either of the polar faces of sic ; a process that leaves a small number of graphene layers on the sic surface.@xcite in the latter system , transport measurements infer that the measured high mobilities are limited to just a few graphene layers ( perhaps only one ) , that must lie near the sic substrate .",
    "while there are similarities between the magnetotransport properties of exfoliated graphene and sic - grown multi - layer graphene films , there are significant differences.@xcite for instance graphene layers grown on different polar faces of sic have electron mobilities that differ by an order of magnitude.@xcite such graphene / substrate specific transport properties strongly suggest that the substrate interaction influences the electronic properties of the graphene sheet .",
    "while this simple assertion may seem obvious , the structure and influence of the interface remain points of heated conjecture",
    ". one can ask if either the exfoliated or the sic - grown multi - layer graphene ( or both ) are really electronically the same as a ideally isolated graphene sheet .",
    "in other words , how does the interface in both systems influence their electronic properties ?",
    "in spite of this debate there has been no direct structural characterization of either the graphene - substrate interface or the graphene layers themselves in either system . in this work",
    "we begin to address this problem by performing a detailed investigation of the interface structure of multi - layer graphene grown on the 4h - sic@xmath0 surface using surface x - ray diffraction ( sxd ) .",
    "prior investigations of 6h- and 4h - sic(0001 ) and @xmath0 surfaces showed that multi - layer graphene films can be grown on these surfaces by sublimating si from sic during heating above @xmath2{{\\ensuremath{\\!^{\\circ}c}}}$ ] in ultrahigh vacuum ( uhv).@xcite these studies show that multi - layer graphene grows epitaxially on the ( 0001 ) si - terminated ( si - face ) surface of sic , while multi - layer graphene grown on the c - terminated @xmath0 ( c - face ) surface is rotationally disordered and under some conditions form nanocaps instead of a smooth film.@xcite an explanation for the structural differences for films grown on the two different faces was proposed by forbeaux et al.@xcite their conjecture is that c - face multi - layer graphene becomes polycrystalline because they have a stronger substrate - film bond compared to si - face graphite .",
    "the relative bond strengths were inferred from k - resolved inverse photoemission spectroscopy ( kripes),@xcite and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy ( hreels ) measurements.@xcite however , recent work has shown that the c - face multi - layer graphene is not polycrystalline and can be grown with domain sizes much larger than those grown on the si - face.@xcite the improved structural order of c - face films correlates with magnetotransport measurements that to date find an order of magnitude improvement in electron mobilities for films grown on the c - face compared to si - face films.@xcite also , electronic coherence lengths exceeding @xmath3{\\mu m}$ ] have been measured for multi - layer graphene films prepared on the c - face of sic.@xcite the question becomes : how can a strongly bonded c - face film seemingly ignore any substrate registry potentials and give rise to large free rotating films ?    besides the question of topography differences , there are more fundamental questions related to electron transport in these films . for instance , how does charge transfer from the substrate contribute to the doping of graphene near the surface ?",
    "one of the most important questions , and possibly related to the charge transport question , is why transport measurements on multi - layer graphene films grown on the @xmath0 c - face seem to be confined to just a few layers ? perhaps the most important question is why conduction measurements suggest the existence of a berry s phase in three or more graphene layers.@xcite similarly , transport measurement infer@xcite , and angle resolved photoemission measurements ( arpes ) confirm@xcite , the existence of a dirac cone in the band structure of multi - layer graphene films .",

    "ab .. _ stacking.@xcite in other words , experiments suggests that the major conductor is either an isolated single graphene sheet or possible _",
    "aa .. _ stacked graphene layers .    in this paper we begin to address these questions .",
    "we have performed x - ray reflectivity experiments on the structure of multi - layer graphene grown on the 4h - sic@xmath0 surface .",
    "we find that the first layer of carbon with an areal density of graphene sits very close to the last bulk sic layer .",
    "for the c - face the graphene - bulk spacing is found to be @xmath4 . this number is consistent with recent _ ab - initio _ calculations that also indicate a covalently bonded first layer that is insulating and has no graphitic electronic character.@xcite we also demonstrate that the c - face graphene films are flat with little or no corrugation in contrast with mechanically exfoliated graphite.@xcite also , by analyzing the graphite inter - layer spacing , we can deduce that the graphene sheets are stacked in a way resembling turbostratic graphite .",
    "these results show that films grown on the c - face of sic have a strongly bonded very flat `` buffer '' layer .",
    "subsequent graphene layers can be rotationally disordered because of the weak registry forces to this buffer layer .",
    "thus the strong bonding and rotational disorder observed can be reconciled in a simple structural model .",
    "most important , the rotational disorder and turbostratic character of the graphite suggest that the _ ab .. _ symmetry of the graphite is broken leaving a graphene character to the films that may help to explain their conduction properties .",
    "all substrates were 4h - sic purchased from cree , inc.@xcite prior to graphitization the @xmath5 mm samples were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone and ethanol . some samples were hydrogen - etched prior to graphitization while others were not .",
    "the etching removed all surface scratches and left a regularly stepped surface but the graphite quality between etched and non - etched samples is difficult to distinguish.@xcite due to the difficulty of preparing c - face 4h - sic samples in uhv , they were prepared by heating to in a vacuum rf - induction furnace ( @xmath6{\\text{torr}}$ ] ) for .@xcite these parameters produced graphitic films of 413 graphene layers .",
    "the thicker films grown on the c - face reflects the current difficulty in producing less than 6 graphene layers in a furnace grown environment.@xcite regardless of the film thickness , the interface and multi - layer graphene film parameters measured were consistent as discussed in the next sections .",
    "once samples have been graphitized , they remain inert allowing them to be transported into the ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) chamber .",

    "this distance is not much larger than a diamond bond length implying a very strong interaction between the first graphene layer and the substrate .",
    "it is consistent with recent band structure calculations that show a large energy gap for a single graphene layer on the 4h - sic@xmath0 surface.@xcite subsequent graphene layers have an rms corrugation ( averaged over 9 layers ) that is less than 0.05 .",
    "this suggest that the strongly bound buffer graphene layer shields subsequent layers from the interface corrugation potential . therefore , unlike exfoliated graphene flakes deposited on @xmath133@xcite , the graphene layers grown by sublimation on the c - face of sic are very smooth .",
    "the graphene films show evidence of a large density of stacking faults .",
    "while the topography of these faults remains to be determined , it does suggest that the _",
    "ab ... _ stacking of bulk graphite is not present in these films .",
    "this may be the reason why dirac electrons , expected only in isolated graphene sheets where _ ab ... _ stacking does not break the graphene symmetry , are seen in this multi - graphene system .",
