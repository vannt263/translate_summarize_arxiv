    "a quantum protocol or experiment can be divided into three stages : preparation , processing , and measurement .",
    "quantum state tomography smithey1993,dunn1995,white1999 and process tomography childs2001,mitchell2003 respectively prescribe a procedure to completely characterize the first two stages , and have been successfully demonstrated experimentally .",
    "state tomography has played a crucial role in identifying and visualizing novel quantum states @xcite .",
    "process tomography is critical for verifying the operation of quantum logic gates @xcite and characterizing decoherence processes myrskog2005 . completing this triad ,",
    "detector tomography is a procedure for determining the povm ( positive operator - valued measure ) set of an arbitrary quantum detector @xcite .",
    "thus , without any knowledge of the inner workings of the detector we could predict its response to any input . to the best of our knowledge , detector tomography has not been demonstrated . here",
    ", we propose an experimental testbed capable of performing detector tomography on measurement devices acting in the fock space of the optical mode ( i.e. , the photon number hilbert space ) .",
    "precise knowledge of the detection povm set is beneficial for measurement driven quantum information processing , such as cluster - state computing raussendorf2001 .",
    "it is also critical for state and process tomography , which use the measurement as a reference .",
    "recently , it has also been shown that one can perform enhanced measurements by projecting onto non - classical states with a detector @xcite . without any need for a theoretical model of the detector ,",
    "detector tomography can establish which states the detector projects onto , possibly establishing whether they are indeed non - classical .",
    "we will begin by introducing the general experimental and theoretical requirements for performing detector tomography .",
    "we will then describe the detectors which we aim to characterize using our proposed testbed . following this",
    ", we will provide a description of the testbed we have proposed to characterize the aforementioned detectors .",
    "finally , we outline a method of visualizing the povm elements in terms of wigner quasi - probability distributions .",
    "detector tomography is a method of experimentally determining the povm associated with the detector .",
    "a theoretical description of detector tomography was introduced by luis and snchez - soto in ref .",
    "luis1999 in 1999 , a maximum - likelihood technique was applied in ref .",
    "@xcite in 2001 , ancilla - assisted detector tomography was considered in 2004 in ref .",
    "@xcite , and an optimal processing scheme devised in 2007 in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in elementary quantum mechanics ,",
    "a measurement is described by a hermitian operator @xmath0 which can be decomposed into a sum of projectors @xmath1 with weights @xmath2 , where each projector corresponds to an outcome of the measurement : @xmath3 these projectors @xmath1 are often deduced by the action of the measuring device in the classical regime .",
    "for example , since a calcite crystal spatially separates the polarization components of a laser beam it is reasoned to act similarly at the quantum level on single photons ( i.e. , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , horizontal and vertical polarization projectors aligned with the axes of the calcite ) .",
    "this example is justified by a theoretical model , namely quantum - electrodynamics , which shows the classical field reduces to field operators at the quantum level .",
    "however , some measurements , such as bell - state measurement @xcite or single - photon detection , can not be traced back to any classical device .",
    "these _ quantum _ detectors typically rely on an unsystematic combination of a theoretical model ( e.g. , semiconductor theory ) and detector characterizations of limited scope ( e.g. , of the detector noise and efficiency ) .",
    "in contrast , detector tomography would provide a systematic method , with minimal assumptions , to characterize these quantum detectors and , thus , predict their action on an general input state .",
    "the most general type of quantum measurement is described by a povm , a set of positive - semidefinite operators @xmath6 corresponding to the measurement outcomes .",
    "these generalized measurements are uniquely quantum in the sense that they have no analogue in the classical regime . for instance , any povm  can be implemented by coupling the measured system to an ancilla system and then performing projective measurements on the combined system @xcite ; the coupling has the potential to create entanglement between the two systems , which is impossible in the classical regime .    in some ways ,",
    "detector tomography is very similar to the established procedure of state tomography . in state tomography ,",
    "one begins with an ensemble of systems prepared identically in state @xmath7 .",
    "a measurement @xmath8 , is performed on a subset of the ensemble for the purpose of estimating the probability @xmath9 : @xmath10this is repeated for a set of measurements @xmath11 , producing a set of estimated probabilities @xmath12 . through eq .",
    "( [ trace ] ) and the precise knowledge of the form of each measurement @xmath8 , one can estimate @xmath7 .",
    "significantly , the role of @xmath8 and @xmath7 are symmetric in eq .",
    "( [ trace ] ) .",
    "this means that with a set of known input states @xmath13 one could instead estimate an unknown measurement @xmath14 through eq .",
    "( [ trace ] ) , which is the goal of detector tomography .    despite these similarities ,",
    "state and detector tomography have some important differences .",
    "one obvious difference is that the former seeks to reconstruct a single operator , @xmath7 , whereas the latter seeks to reconstruct a set of operators @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number of measurement outcomes .",
    "both the density matrices and the povm elements must be positive - semidefinite and , hence , hermitian . however , density matrices have a unit trace , whereas a povm element does not . instead ,",
    "a povm  set @xmath17 must satisfy , @xmath18where @xmath19 is the identity , ensuring that the probabilities for all the measurement outcomes sum to one .",
    "this has implications for mathematical strategies for reconstruction , such as maximum likelihood , where eqs .",
    "( [ trace ] ) and ( [ sumtoone ] ) must be included as constraints on the reconstructions .",
    "generally , in tomography one requires what is known as a tomographically complete  set to reference against . in state tomography",
    ", this translates to a set of reference measurements @xmath11 that span the @xmath20 dimensional hilbert - schmidt space of the density matrix ( the @xmath21 term comes from the unit trace constraint ) . in detector tomography ,",
    "the reference states @xmath13 must span the hilbert - schmidt space of the povm set .",
    "a spanning set will necessarily have at least @xmath22 elements in it . to determine if a particular @xmath22 sized subset of the total set spans the space , one first vectorizes each element in the subset , then stacks these row vectors into a matrix , and then calculates the determinant . if the determinant is nonzero this subset is a spanning set and hence , the set of reference states ( or reference measurements , in the case of state tomography ) is tomographically complete .",
    "we shall consider an example later in the paper .",
    "before performing detector tomography , one needs to analyze the detectors in order to identify the hilbert space they function in , and then find a suitable set of input states .",
    "we propose a testbed for two types of related detectors : the avalanche photodiode ( apd ) , and the time - multiplexing detector ( tmd ) .",
    "apds are photodiodes that use the avalanche effect ( i.e. , impact ionization leading to the exponential multiplication of carriers ) to achieve sensitivity to single photons .",
    "these detectors have the remarkable ability to detect a single photon . unfortunately",
    ", if more than one photon is detected this information is lost in the avalanche .",
    "hence , this detector acts as a binary detector ; the two possible detection outcomes are detection of at least one photon ( click ) and the detection of no photons ( no click ) . for each photon impinging on the detector",
    "there is an intrinsic efficiency of the detector @xmath23 that the photon will cause an avalanche .",
    "the probability of detecting at least one out of @xmath24 photons is given by @xmath25and the probability of detecting none of the @xmath24 photons is , @xmath26thus , there is a non - zero probability of getting a no click event , even with photons hitting the detector .",
    "the detection can be approximated with the two povm elements , @xmath27these approximate povm elements do not include effects such as dark counts , afterpulsing , and detector saturation . the contributions from dark counts and afterpulsing can cause detection events without an actual photon being present .",
    "they will increase the values of the @xmath28 matrix elements .",
    "however since dark counts are independent of the actual count rate they should predominantly affect the matrix elements at low photon numbers .",
    "conversely , afterpulsing is dependent on a counting event happening before , and thus , would be more prominent for higher photon numbers .",
    "detector saturation would manifest itself by a dependence of @xmath23 on @xmath24 .",
    "these effects would have to be included in a more complicated detector model if one desired to derive more realistic povm elements .",
    "previous experiments with apds @xcite indicate that these approximate povm elements will be a reasonable model on which to design a testbed .",
    "several schemes have been proposed to overcome the lack of photon number resolution with apds @xcite . in a time multiplexing detector ,",
    "the pulse under investigation is split into several spatial and temporal bins and then detected with apds achilles2003,coldenstrodt2007,fitch2003 .",
    "the principle of operation of our implementation is depicted in figure [ loopyschematics ] .",
    "the pulse under investigation ( @xmath29 ) is split at a beamsplitter and one of the two spatial modes ( @xmath30 ) is delayed with respect to the other one ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the two spatial modes are then recombined at a beamsplitter , resulting in two temporal modes in each of the spatial outputs of the beamsplitter ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "additional delay stages can be added to further increase the number of temporal modes .",
    "we propose to perform detector tomography on a tmd with two delay stages , resulting in a total of eight output bins .",
    "the advantage of splitting the incoming pulse into many bins is that if the pulse contains several photons these may be distributed into different bins and , thus , counted as individual photons by apds .",
    "the measurement result of the tmd is the number of click events summed over all the bins .",
    "thus , for our detector , with two stages , there are nine outcomes , 0 to 8 clicks .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath33 clicks does not imply there were only @xmath33 photons at the tmd input .",
    "photons may end up in the same bin and , thus , result in fewer clicks than the number of photons in the input pulse .",
    "photons also suffer from losses in the tmd  and the detection efficiency of the apds .",
    "while this introduces an uncertainty in the measurement outcome on a shot - to - shot basis , for an ensemble measurement of the same quantum state the resulting click - statistics grasped in the vector @xmath34 can be related to the photon number statistics as a vector @xmath35 of the input state by @xmath36where @xmath37 represents the losses in the system and @xmath38 is called the convolution matrix , which accounts for several photons ending up in the same bin after splitting .",
    "the loss matrix can be calculated by combining all losses in the system and modeling them as a single beam splitter with reflectivity @xmath39 at the front of the fiber network @xcite as , @xmath40with @xmath41 .",
    "this simply describes the probability of @xmath42 out of @xmath24 photons being transmitted . for the convolution matrix one",
    "has to take into account all possible routes a photon could take through the fiber network achilles2004 and the matrix elements can be calculated as follows :    @xmath43 ,   & k < n.\\end{cases}\\label{fancyc}\\ ] ]    in reality , the beamsplitters used in the tmd are never exactly 50% reflective due to variation in their manufacture . for a @xmath44-bin tmd ,",
    "@xmath45 are the probabilities of a single photon exiting from the fiber network in a particular bin .",
    "while these probabilities would all be equal in the case of 50/50 beamsplitters , we set them by calibration measurements using an intense laser input pulse .",
    "the first two lines of eq .",
    "( [ fancyc ] ) correspond to the straightforward cases of more photons being detected than entering the detector ( for which the probability is zero , if dark counts and afterpulsing are negligible ) and detecting all incoming photons respectively . in the third case , @xmath46 ,",
    "all possible combinations of distributing these @xmath24 photons into the bins have to be taken into account .",
    "these different combinations are represented by the @xmath33-tuples @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "some of the bins can be occupied by more than one photon .",
    "all possible distributions of the photons across the bins are described by the possible partitions of @xmath24 into @xmath33 parts . these can be represented by @xmath33-tuples @xmath50 with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and the definition @xmath53 . for each bin",
    ", one has to consider all possible ways in which the @xmath54 photons ending up in this particular bin can be choosen .",
    "with the photons remaining to be distributed given by @xmath55 , the binomial coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ fancyc ] ) accounts for this .",
    "however , if some of the elements of the tuple @xmath56 are equal , the binomial coefficient will overestimate the number of distributions .",
    "bins occupied with the same number of photons are not distinguishable , but are counted separately .",
    "this must be corrected for by dividing by the number of permutations these bins can form , i.e. , the factorial of the number of bins with equal number of photons .",
    "we denote this by @xmath57 .",
    "for example for the tuple @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "for the eight bin tmd that we plan to use in the proposed detector tomography scheme , the convolution matrix was calculated using classical measurements of the probabilities @xmath45 and reads : @xmath60 the matrices developed above actually contain the povm  elements describing the tmd .",
    "we expect these povm  elements to be diagonal in the photon number basis since the tmd has no phase reference and , thus , no sensitivity to off - diagonal coherences . in eq .",
    "( [ loopyequation ] ) , the matrix @xmath61 represents the reaction of the detector to different numbers of incoming photons .",
    "when the matrix @xmath62 acts on a photon number distribution @xmath35 , the probability of a particular measurement outcome is found by taking an inner product of @xmath35 with the corresponding row of the matrix .",
    "this action is similar to the action of the trace in eq .",
    "( [ trace ] ) , as we will demonstrate explicitly .",
    "this allows us to identify the rows of @xmath61 as the diagonals of the tmd s povm : @xmath63 _ { j,0 } & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\   0 & \\ddots   & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\   0 & 0 & \\left [ \\mathbf{c}\\cdot \\mathbf{l}\\right ] _ { j , i } & 0 & 0 \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 & \\ddots   & 0 \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\left [ \\mathbf{c}\\cdot \\mathbf{l}\\right ] _ { j , n}\\end{bmatrix } , \\label{povmwithcl}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the @xmath64-clicks outcome , and @xmath65 _ { j , i}$ ] is the value in the @xmath64th row and @xmath66th column of @xmath61 . the density matrix of the incoming quantum state is related to @xmath35 via , @xmath67expressed in the number basis , where the @xmath68th element of @xmath35 is @xmath69 .",
    "we leave the off - diagonal elements of @xmath7 as undetermined , since they do not contribute after the trace . using this form",
    "we evaluate the trace in eq .",

    "( [ loopyequation ] ) , as we expected .",
    "as we have shown , one can derive a theoretical povm set to describe a time - multiplexed detector .",
    "however , as with the apd , this is a simplified description of the povm and does not include afterpulsing ( which can result in a click from one time bin triggering a click in the next ) , dark counts in the apds at the outputs , as well as imperfections in the counting electronics ( which can be considerably complicated ) .    in summary , the apd and",
    "the tmd perform their measurements in the fock space of the optical mode .",
    "furthermore , both detectors have povms that are expected to be diagonal in the photon - number basis .",
    "since this confines their action to a subspace of the fock space , it should allow us to simplify the tomography .",
    "for the apds all photon numbers apart from zero photons are combined into a single detection event and , to a first approximation , the only detector parameter is the efficiency .",
    "this makes the apd a rather simple detector and a theoretical model of their povm elements was easily calculated .",
    "thus , apds would be the first detector with which we propose to demonstrate a proof of principle detector tomography .",
    "the tmd , on the other hand , is non - trivial to describe , with both the loss and the convolution matrix having complicated forms . incorporating realistic apds into this model would be challenging , if not impossible .",
    "consequently , the tmd is the second detector that we propose to perform detector tomography on .",
    "it is a suitable candidate for a serious test of the detector tomography procedure .",
    "we propose to compare the reconstructed povm set to the theoretical ones derived above to check how accurate our detector models really are .",
    "to perform tomography of these two detectors , we need probe states in the fock space .",
    "we must also identify a set of states that span the space of the detector operators , i.e. , a tomographically complete set . since neither detector possesses a phase - reference ( such as a local oscillator )",
    ", we make the safe assumption for our proposed testbed that the off - diagonal components of @xmath17 for each detector are zero in the photon - number basis .",
    "it follows that each @xmath71 contains @xmath72 free parameters , one for each diagonal element , where @xmath72 is the the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "the tomographically complete set will then contain at least @xmath72 input states .",
    "unfortunately , the photon number representation of the hilbert space is infinite , and so we must truncate it at some point for our mathematical reconstruction .",
    "this truncation sets the @xmath72 we shall use in the tomography testbed we propose .",
    "a good point to set this truncation at is in the region in which the detector behavior has saturated to a constant .",
    "e.g. we expect the tmd s response to 100 photons and 101 photons will be nearly identical ( outcome 8-clicks with @xmath73 probability ) , making @xmath74 a good place to truncate .",
    "since we do not require sensitivity to inter - photon coherences a naturally tomographically complete set of input states @xmath13 for our proposed testbed is the fock states .",
    "each input fock state would allow us to determine the corresponding diagonal element in each of the tmd s measurement operators @xmath75 however , fock states are difficult to produce with high fidelity .",
    "fortunately , another candidate , the coherent state , is straightforward to produce with high - fidelity .",
    "apart from being the quantum state that most resembles a classical state , coherent states have a unique property under attenuation : in the photon - number basis , a coherent state @xmath76 can be written , @xmath77which results in a poissonian photon - number distribution . with attenuation @xmath78 ,",
    "the coherent state transforms according to , @xmath79this is another coherent state with a lower mean number of photons .",
    "this property is important for the creation of known states in the low photon number regime , a necessity for tomography on single photon detectors .",
    "specifically , the high - fidelity coherent states produced by a laser could be easily attenuated to power levels suitable for the tomography while still retaining their form .",
    "attenuation also reduces the impact of technical noise in the laser .",
    "the fractional uncertainty in the photon number of a coherent state , @xmath80 , is - once it is attenuated to a low photon level - much higher than the pulse - to - pulse jitter of the pulse energy of our laser source ( typical values around @xmath81 ) .",
    "this suggests that the use of coherent states would also be reasonably robust against technical noise .",
    "it is well known , that a continuous set of coherent probe state vectors @xmath76 form a basis for the fock space , @xmath82however it is not as clear that they form a basis for the hilbert - schmidt space .",
    "the proof that they do lies in the existence of the p - function @xmath83 : @xmath84however , we expect to use a discrete subset of coherent states @xmath85 rather than the full continuous basis for our proposed detector tomography testbed .",
    "we now attempt to find if this reduced set is tomographically complete .",
    "we vectorize @xmath72 coherent states density matrices @xmath86 @xmath87 , keeping only the diagonals ( since our detector povm set is contained within this subspace ) . stacking these row vectors into a matrix ,",
    "we find , @xmath88the next step , finding the determinant , is difficult to do in general .",
    "instead we consider a specific set of @xmath89 reference coherent states , in evenly spaced steps from @xmath90 to @xmath91 . the determinant @xmath92implying that this set is tomographically complete , for a space truncated at photon number basis state @xmath93 .",
    "consequently , it appears that a finite set of coherent states are a good set of reference states for our proposed detector tomography testbed .",
    "an essential requirement for a tomography system is precise and accurate knowledge of the probe states . in the context of our proposed testbed",
    ", this translates to knowing @xmath94 accurately . keeping in mind that @xmath95 is connected to @xmath94 via , @xmath96for pulsed light of the wavelength @xmath97 and the repetition frequency @xmath98 the time averaged power @xmath99 can be calculated by",
    ", @xmath100which then enables a calculation of @xmath101 from the measured power : @xmath102while @xmath103 and @xmath104 can generally be determined accurately , p can not .",
    "systematic error in the power measurement would result in a global scaling of the detector response : the reconstructed `` efficiency '' of the detector would scale by the error , while the form of the povm element would remain unchanged .",
    "we expect this @xmath105 systematic error to be less than 5% . for @xmath106 , @xmath107 nm and @xmath108 khz ( experimental parameters , we plan to run the proposed tomography on ) , @xmath109 attowatts , a strikingly low average power .",
    "however , since coherent states are invariant under attenuation , a highly transmissive beamsplitter could be used to pick off a large portion of the incoming beam .",
    "if the ratio of power in the transmitted and reflected arms is well calibrated , the high power arm can be used to monitor the power in the low power arm .",
    "this can leverage the power into the microwatt range , accessible to power meters with calibrations that can be traced to a national standards institute . in our proposed testbed",
    ", this beamsplitter would be placed after a variable attenuator , used to set @xmath94 , as depicted in figure [ optical_setup ] . for phase - sensitive detectors , a tomographically complete set of input states",
    "could be generated simply by adding a variable path length for the coherent state in the testbed , to phase shift @xmath110 , i.e. , @xmath111 .",
    "we simulated the tomography of a tmd with our proposed testbed by using the model given in eq .",
    "( [ loopyequation ] ) .",
    "we used the convolution matrix for our tmd displayed in eq .",
    "( [ cmsmtmd ] ) and simulated a detector tomography using 400 different values of @xmath101 for the reference states , ranging from @xmath112 to @xmath113 . in figure [ simulation ] , we plot the probabilities of both the 1-click and 5-click outcomes against the @xmath101 of the probe state .",
    "the curves for the 1-click and the 5-click outcomes have very different shapes with small overlap : while the 1-click exhibits a well defined peak for low @xmath101 , the 5-click peak is much broader and has a maximum at higher @xmath101 .",
    "this shows that different measurement outcomes are associated with easily distinguishable responses to a spanning set of input @xmath114 suggesting that the mathematical inversion from the estimated probabilities ( e.g. , with eq .",
    "( [ trace ] ) ) is practical .",
    "an analogous tomography device exists in the area of homodyne state tomography : the eight - port homodyne system . this device projects the unknown state onto a coherent state , much the same as our proposed testbed .",
    "it has been pointed out that reconstruction of the density matrix from the measured data in an eight - port homodyne system is an ill - conditioned problem @xcite .",
    "noise in the measured data causes the inversion of eq .",
    "( [ sumtoone ] ) to have large errors , indicating that while coherent states form a tomographically complete basis , they are still deficient for tomography . considering noise from counting statistics , in detector tomography",
    "the data set size is limited only by the repetition rate of the laser , which can be as high as 80 mhz .",
    "thus , we can quickly accumulate enough data such that counting errors for each outcome are insignificant .",
    "however , sources of noise , other than from counting , can hamper inversion . to counter the effect of these",
    "a common strategy is to introduce some amount of regularization to the inversion @xcite .",
    "often , this regularization is implicit in the reconstruction , as in the radon transformation or pattern functions used in two - port homodyne tomography , which introduce smoothing of the data @xcite .",
    "indeed , filtering of data is a common technique established in the origins of tomography in medical computer imaging .",
    "these techniques have yet to be used in detector tomography , but we expect their application will be fruitful .",
    "a common complaint about quantum tomography is that the end result is difficult to interpret physically @xcite .",
    "for example , in process tomography the reconstructed map for the process has @xmath115 elements for a @xmath72 dimensional hilbert space and thus quickly becomes too large to understand upon inspection .",
    "a reconstructed povm set can similarly contain a large number of independent parameters , @xmath116 if there are @xmath16 measurement outcomes . however , the measurement operators @xmath17 benefit from their mathematical similarities to density states , allowing us to apply many of the same representation methods .",
    "our detectors operate in the fock space , which can be represented in the @xmath117 and @xmath118 basis , where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the normalized electric field quadratures .",
    "this points to a particularly appealing representation commonly used to represent the state of a field mode , the wigner function .",
    "the wigner function @xmath119 is calculated in the standard way from the povm element @xmath71 @xcite :    @xmath120    since the measurement operators @xmath17 do not have unit trace , this detector wigner function is not normalized , @xmath121and its marginals should not be interpreted as probability distributions .",
    "nonetheless , it retains some appealing features . for example",
    ", the probability of measurement outcome @xmath122 is , @xmath123where  @xmath124 is the standard wigner function of the input state @xmath125 thus one can visualize the measurement as the overlap of the two wigner functions .",
    "we plot the wigner functions of the theoretical measurement operators of the tmd in figure [ wigner ] .",
    "the tmd has no phase sensitivity and so the wigner function for each measurement operator is rotationally symmetric around a vertical axis through the origin .",
    "thus , on the right of figure wigner we also present a cross - section of each wigner function to show its form more clearly .",
    "the wigner functions are found from the tmd povm  that was derived earlier , assuming a loss of 48% .",
    "we show three of the nine measurement operators , namely 0-click , 1-click and 5-click ( in the figure , these are @xmath126 @xmath127 and , @xmath128 , respectively ) .",
    "remarkably , the 0-click and 1-click wigner functions look very similar to their state counterparts , the vacuum state and single - photon state .",
    "this is despite the fact that there are contributions from all incoming photon numbers to both ( i.e. , four incoming photons might all be lost and thus result in a 0-click event , or two incoming photons might end up in the same time bin and thus result in 1-click ) .",
    "the 0-click wigner function has a gaussian profile similar to the vacuum wigner function , whereas the 1-click event goes negative at the origin just as the single - photon state does .",
    "the wigner functions for higher click numbers quickly diverge from their photonic equivalents though .",
    "the 5-click wigner function is significantly different from the five photon wigner function ; the former has nine radial nodes , whereas the latter has five ( the number of nodes equals the photon number for fock states ) .",
    "since there are only eight bins , there is a sizeable probability that six or seven incoming photons entered only five bins in total .",
    "consequently , there will be significant contributions to the 5-click wigner function from these higher photon numbers , distorting it from the ideal five photon wigner function .",
    "in contrast , the probability that two or three incoming photons entered only one bin is relatively small , which explains why 1-click wigner function contains much less distortion .",
    "we have detailed a proposal for performing detector tomography on two detectors operating in the fock space .",
    "the proposed testbed generates a sequence of calibrated weak coherent states against which to reference a detector .",
    "we have shown that these coherent states form a tomographically complete set for the two detectors , and thus , a tomographic reconstruction of all the povm elements should be possible . in the near future",
    ", we plan to perform detector tomography on these two detectors . however , we envision that a reconstruction of the povm elements in the high - dimensional photon number space will present substantial computational challenges",
    ". the reconstruction will also have to deal with noise and uncertainty in the input states .",
    "this is usually not considered in state tomography , where the measurements are considered to be close to ideal .    with the demonstration of detector tomography , experimentalists will have general procedures for characterizing all the parts of a general quantum device : the input states , the quantum circuit , and , now , the measurement .",
    "we expect this detector tomography to be particularly useful for devices that depend on generalized measurements for optimal functioning , such as state or process discriminators ( i.e. , unambiguous state discrimination peres1988,mohseni2004 ) .",
    "detector tomography should also be useful for devices where measurement drives logic such as in cluster - state computing or linear optics quantum computing .",
