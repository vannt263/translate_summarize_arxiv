    "the mechanism responsible of this behavior is the same discussed in the previous section for the staggered magnetization .",

    "lastly , it remains to make sure that @xmath104 may be identified with the response function of a single interface .",
    "this we have done by measuring the response function @xmath105 in the process with only one interface in the initial condition and finding ( fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] ) a behavior quite close to the one of fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] .",
    "one of the hypothesis for the validity of  ( [ i1.2 ] ) relating static and dynamic properties is that the large time limit of @xmath106 reaches the equilibrium value @xmath14 .",
    "it is then clear from  ( [ i2 ] ) that for this to be true in the phase ordering process @xmath11 must vanish , since this is an intrinsically out of equilibrium contribution . in other words ,",
    "the existence of the interfacial degrees of freedom which do not equilibrate must not play a role at the level of the response function .",
    "indeed , @xmath11 normally does to vanish .",
    "however , there are exceptions in special cases and the study of these is quite instructive since it allows to gain insight into the properties of @xmath11 .",
    "one dimensional systems with a scalar order parameter and frozen bulk thermal fluctuations do make such a special case . in the @xmath0 pure ising model , due to the pointlike structure of domain walls ,",
    "the minimization of magnetic energy introduces a bias in the diffusion of interfaces which leads to a nonvanishing @xmath11 through  ( [ i8 ] ) .",
    "elsewhere@xcite we have analyzed how  ( [ i8 ] ) ceases to hold in going from @xmath0 to @xmath107 , due to the extended nature of interfaces . in that case",
    "the minimization of magnetic energy is hindered by the competing need to minimize the curvature of interfaces and @xmath11 asymptotically disappears . in this paper",
    "we have investigated a different mechanism altering the delicate balance  ( [ i8 ] ) between the gain and loss of contributions to the response function , which does not require the passage from pointlike to extended defects . in the @xmath0 rfim",
    "it is the gradual roughening of the landscape that slows down the minimization of the magnetic energy with respect to the growth law of the domain size and which eventually yields an asymptotically vanishing @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the overall picture which comes out is that a coarsening system is always out of equilibrium in the sense that there are always interfaces around , each one producing the out of equilibrium contribution @xmath28 to the response function , independently from dimensionality or the presence of quenched disorder .",
    "these are elements which affect the finer details , like whether @xmath28 is a constant or how fast it grows .",
    "where these properties come into play is in putting together the contributions of all the separate interfaces through @xmath108 which , now depending on dimensionality or quenched disorder , may then produce either a vanishing or an asymptotically persistent net result .",
    "finally , a comment should be made about the non commutativity of the order of the limits @xmath109 and @xmath35 . if the limit @xmath109 is taken first , the linear response function of the pure ising model is obtained and , as discussed above , ( [ i1.2 ] ) is violated . instead , if @xmath35 is taken first one finds the asymptotic linear response function  ( [ 3.9.3 ] ) of the rfim which is consistent with  ( [ i1.2 ] ) .",
