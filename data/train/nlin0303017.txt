    "bohr s model for the hydrogenlike atoms gives the correct ( exact ) spectrum for such systems and so was an important paradigm in the development of the so - called old quantum theory .",
    "however , the extension of that model to other non - hydrogenlike atoms is non - trivial .",
    "similar ideas were soon applied to the helium atom ( two - electron system )  @xcite , but the old quantum theory can not describe the helium atom in the same accuracy level of the hydrogen atom . essentially , the inaccuracy is not an exclusive manifestation of the old quantum theory , but classical theory .",
    "a three - body system is generically a non - integrable system , it is not possible to find the necessary number of integrals of motion as for two - body system ( integrable ) .",
    "a nonintegrable system can show several behavior patterns depending on the initial conditions , i.e. , a ( quasi-)regular , chaotic or mixing behaviors  @xcite .",
    "the regular or integrable system obeys special conditions which allows the application of the basic principles of the old quantum theory rules .",
    "however , that theory has some incorrect statements , e.g. , the inability to treat the conjugated points along classical trajectories  @xcite . the correct version of the old quantum theory is denominated semiclassical theory .",
    "important applications of semiclassical theory can be seen in the studies of the connection between the classical mechanic and quantum one ( correspondence principle ) when the classical system is chaotic  @xcite .",
    "the helium atom can be solved in a high degree of accuracy with quantum mechanics with `` brute force . ''",
    "that system was studied at the end of the seventies  @xcite with a semiclassical theory obtaining good results . a decade before , the semiclassical theory was developed by gutzwiller with application to the quantization of chaotic systems  @xcite .",
    "meeting those conditions , in the beginning of the nineties , the helium atom was extensively studied with semiclassical theory  @xcite .",
    "several important results were managed for helium atom in one dimension based on classical properties of the periodic orbits .",
    "the semiclassical theory can also be applied to molecules .",
    "of course , the molecular systems are remarkably more difficult to understand in comparison to atoms .",
    "it is possible to make some extension of those atomic studies in order to improve the knowledge in the molecular system and principally the chemical bond .    since dalton s time , or even before",
    ", people try to understand the nature of the ( chemical ) bond among atoms or , in other words , the molecular structure .",
    "bohr was the first to try to describe the chemical bond under a physical point - of - view of the hydrogen molecule ( h@xmath0 ) and other systems  @xcite .",
    "bohr made an original proposal to describe the chemical bond of the hydrogen molecule .",
    "he proposed that the valence electrons ( outer electrons ) were localized in a ring around the internuclear axis representing the chemical bond .",
    "this was the first physical interpretation of the chemical bond . that description was made before the _ ad hoc _ lewis , langmuir and thomson s theories  @xcite .",
    "the extension of such studies of the helium atom to molecular systems seems natural through the study of h@xmath0 .",

    "the first correct semiclassical quantization was presented at the end of the seventies  @xcite .",
    "however , the h@xmath0 molecule , even more so than h@xmath1 , contains the basic ingredients for understanding the chemical bond , i.e. , an electron pair .",
    "the hydrogen molecule is the natural choice to start the study of the chemical systems since it is the simplest problem where the chemical aspects can be studied in full details .",
    "the problem of the hydrogen molecule belongs in no - person s land between chemistry and contemporary physics .",
    "this molecule is very simple conceptually considered in the point - of - view of the present theoretical quantum chemistry and very complex over first principles of the present physic . on the other hand",
    ", we try to show that the hydrogen molecule is a capital problem in order to understand the fundamental matter structure and the quantum mechanics .",
    "semiclassical studies of  h@xmath0 with few types of symmetric bohr and langmuir s orbits in two dimension ( 2-d ) were considered  @xcite .",
    "those studies of h@xmath0 were made with few 2-d periodic orbit filling the 3-d .",
    "the full 3-d problem is generically impossible to deal with .",
    "however , if one uses chemical and physical arguments , i.e. , disposition of electrons in electron - pair , symmetries , etc , some special periodic orbits can be found and an incipient quantization with few orbits can be achieved .",
    "these semiclassical studies can be considered to understand the chemical bond .",
    "it is known that the chemical bond is formed by decreasing of kinetic energy in the chemical bond direction with accumulation of the electronic charge in the internuclear region  @xcite .",
    "we show with classical and semiclassical physics that the perpendicular plane to the axial direction is the most important region to describe the chemical bonding .    here",
    ", we show a modest first step to understand `` the correspondence principle '' in chemical world that treats essentially nonlinear systems .",

    "the appearance of scars in the wavefunction can help to find specific pos .",
    "of course , a systematic search of the pos is necessary for complete knowledge of the h@xmath118 system .",
    "we can also use some chemical knowledge to find some classical track in the multidimensional quantum world . those knowledge can be the electronic distribution around the chemical bonding ; electroafinity , i.e. , localization of the electron around some preferential atoms ; adiabatization coordinates ( repulsion and attraction coordinates ) , chemical bonding dynamics ( rate between kinetic and potential energies ) , etc .",
    "one can select some periodic orbits considering the molecular orbital shape of the states , e.g. , @xmath290 states with bohr orbits and @xmath291 states with langmuir orbits  @xcite ; covalent states with @xmath50 and pendulum orbits ; repulsive states with @xmath49 ; ionic states with @xmath52 orbits ; the profile of @xmath292 ; etc .",

    "it is known the origin of the bonding energy of the h@xmath0 molecule is a consequence of the kinetic energy depression that happens with accumulation of the electronic charge in the internuclear region  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to anticipate some manifestations of chemical bonding properties with 1-d orbits .",
    "the instability of the 1-d po in the internuclear direction indicates that the motion of the electrons in that direction can not be important in the formation of the chemical bonding .",
    "perpendicular motion to internuclear axis , that is a stable motion or weakly unstable one , can be important to formation of the chemical bonding since the electrons can orbit the nuclei in a plane perpendicular to internuclear axis . therefore , bohr s , lewis , and other equivalent theories of the electron pair localization  @xcite can have a simple interpretation with a deep meaning in the description of the chemical bonding .",
    "the h@xmath0 molecule has some return points near to nuclei ( centrifugal barrier ) and near to average middle point of the internuclear axis ( electron - electron repulsion ) .",
    "the average kinetic energy near to nuclei is high and near to middle point is low .",
    "the electronic charge can accumulate dynamically near to middle point because of the slow motion and consequently the electron permanence is high in average .",
    "the permanence time depends on the motion , on the po and on the state ( bonding or not ) .",
    "we studied the behavior of the kinetic energy of the @xmath50 and pendulum fundamental pos and verify that there are several regions of the electron accumulation .",
    "a simple connection between the bohr orbit of the h@xmath118 and ruedenberg s theory of the origin of the binding energy for h@xmath118 was found  @xcite . that connection considers the behavior of the kinetic energy and the virial theorem for some variations over the bohr orbit .",
    "shortly , ruedenberg s work  @xcite shows that the chemical bond formation is consequence of the depression of the kinetic energy along of the internuclear axis .",
    "the module of the total @xmath293 , potential @xmath294 and kinetic @xmath295 energies of the molecule are bigger than those of the separated atoms with @xmath296 ( virial rate ) .",
    "the molecule can be seen as a box with dimension along of the internuclear axis @xmath297 bigger than the atom @xmath298 and the dimension perpendicular to the internuclear axis @xmath299 smaller than the atom @xmath300 .",
    "that is , @xmath301 and @xmath302 .",
    "how @xmath303 , it is more probable to obtain a smaller kinetic energy in the parallel direction of the chemical bond of the molecule than of the atom ; conversely for perpendicular direction .",
    "it is possible to show that the smaller value of the kinetic energy causes the depression in it around the middle plane and the electrons can accumulate between the nuclei .",
    "the electron accumulation and the stable motion in the perpendicular direction of the internuclear axis are the classical ingredients of the chemical bond .",
    "now , we need to obtain the principal pos that describe the ground state in order to study the formation of the chemical bond .    our semiclassical studies give us that the @xmath49 pos contribute to describe as a quasi - classical interaction ( each electron is described by an independent electronic density )  @xcite of the two hydrogen atom to constitute the ground state of the molecule . that @xmath49 configuration is enough to describe the united atom limit , i.e.",
    ", he atom , but it is not for the chemical bond since the @xmath49 pos give a non - bonding behavior .    the chemical bond is obtained by quantum interference of the atomic wavefunction @xmath257 . that interference can be mimicked by the semiclassical quantization since it describes the minimum of the energy for ground state .",
    "bohr quantization for h@xmath118 gave the first calculation of the chemical bond  @xcite .",
    "the connection of that ( semiclassical single ) quantization with ruedenberg s theory was made  @xcite .",
    "however , bohr quantization gave a qualitative result since the h@xmath118 molecule can not be reduced to one simple po .",
    "the h@xmath118 molecule is a complex system , several pos must participate of a ( semi)quantitative description .",
    "the ground state of the h@xmath118 is described basically by @xmath49 , @xmath50 and pendulum pos .",
    "the @xmath49 pos are very important since gives the principal interaction of the charges .",
    "the @xmath50 and pendulum pos give the fine adjust in order to manage the chemical bond .",
    "the @xmath50 and pendulum pos were studied classically and they showed similar depression of the kinetic energy obtained with quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "probably the pos which show a depression of the kinetic energy between the nuclei are important to describe a chemical bond .",
    "the minima of the potential energy for excited states caused by avoid - crossings ( see fig.10 ) can be different .",
    "the starting point of the studies of the semiclassical quantization of the h@xmath118  @xcite was the bohr orbit for h@xmath118  @xcite .",
    "bohr extended that model ( orbit ) to describe other molecules . that bohr s idea was applied to several molecules  @xcite and potentially the semiclassical quantization",
    "can also be applied to those systems .    in summary ,",
    "some 1-d pos show an accumulation of the electronic charge between the nuclei .",
    "the stability of the perpendicular dof of the internuclear axis shows a stable or weakly unstable motion .",
    "therefore , the electrons can accumulate preferencially in the chemical bond field .",
    "several studies for the h@xmath0 molecule were shown in this paper .",
    "these studies are important for a future understanding of the connection between classical and quantum worlds ( `` the correspondence principle '' ) to chaotic problems and of the chemical bond since the h@xmath0 system contains the basic ingredients ( two - electron binding ) for that .",
    "some bohr - sommerfeld quantizations have been performed , but those calculations were not enough to describe the @xmath304 system .",
    "unfortunately , that ( chaotic ) system is not integrable and a global semiclassical quantization must be made .",
    "gutzwiller formula and the zeta function were calculated for 1-d periodic orbits .",
    "we can enumerate some perspectives of this work :    \\a ) obtain the relation between chemical bond and classical properties of periodic orbits : the pos which show a depression of the kinetic energy between the nuclei are important to describe a chemical bond ;    \\b ) verify the correspondence principle for h@xmath0 , mainly in chaotic regime ;    \\c ) use the classical and semiclassical mechanics to help the quantum mechanic interpretation ;    \\d ) use the semiclassical method in order to give the correct results for high excited state in substitution of the quantum numerical calculation .",
    "mainly , this work describes a theoretical study of the non - linear dynamics of the hydrogen molecule .",
    "we show a first step to understand `` the correspondence principle '' in the chemical world that treats essentially nonlinear systems .",
