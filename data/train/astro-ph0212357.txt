    "a complete theory of galaxy formation should predict the distributions of galaxy luminosities , colors , sizes , and morphologies , the correlations among these properties , and the relation between the spatial clustering of any given class of galaxies and that of the underlying dark matter distribution .",
    "this last class of predictions , the `` bias '' of galaxies as a function of their observable properties , is becoming an increasingly important test of theoretical models thanks to the new generation of large galaxy redshift surveys , in particular the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) . the `` halo occupation distribution '' ( hod ) formalism is an especially powerful framework for carrying out such tests ; it characterizes the bias of a class of galaxies by the probability @xmath0 that a halo of virial mass @xmath1 contains @xmath2 such galaxies and additional prescriptions that specify the relative distributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos .",
    "if the hod at fixed halo mass is statistically independent of the halo s large scale environment , as theoretical models predict ( @xcite ; this paper ) , then this description of galaxy bias is essentially complete : given the hod and the halo population predicted by a particular cosmological model , one can calculate any galaxy clustering statistic , on scales from the linear regime to the deeply non - linear regime .",
    "empirical determinations of the hod for different galaxy types would therefore summarize everything that observed galaxy clustering has to say about the physics of galaxy formation , in a form that can be readily compared to theoretical predictions .",
    "this paper examines the hods predicted by the two leading theoretical methods for studying galaxy formation and bias in a cosmological context : semi - analytic models ( e.g. , @xcite ) and hydrodynamic numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we apply both methods to a @xmath3cdm cosmological model ( inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological constant ) , adopting the same cosmological parameters in each case .",
    "we focus on galaxy samples defined by thresholds in baryon mass and stellar population age , which are roughly analogous to observational samples defined by cuts in luminosity and color . except for using the same cosmological model and thus the same present - day halo population",
    ", we do not make any efforts to `` tune '' the semi - analytic calculation to match the hydrodynamic simulation ; we apply each method in its `` standard '' form .",
    "we present results for the various features of the hod  the mean occupation @xmath5 as a function of halo mass , moments of the distribution @xmath10 , and the spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies within halos  and we interpret these features in terms of the physical processes represented in the theoretical models .",
    "in the short term , our results should provide useful input to theoretical models of galaxy clustering by allowing the predictions of these galaxy formation models to be `` bootstrapped '' into analytic calculations or larger volume n - body simulations , and they offer guidance to efforts to infer parameters of the hod from observational data . in the slightly longer term , these predictions will be tested by empirical determinations of the hod , and any discrepancies with observations may point the way to necessary revisions of the galaxy formation model or the underlying cosmological model .",
    "several aspects of the hod predicted by semi - analytic models have been investigated in the pioneering papers of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which used semi - analytic methods to assign galaxy populations to the halos of n - body simulations . @xcite and @xcite measured @xmath0 from the @xcite models and incorporated them into analytic predictions of galaxy clustering and bias ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "hod predictions of hydrodynamic simulations have been presented by @xcite at redshifts @xmath11 and @xmath12 and by @xcite at @xmath11 , 2 , and 0 .",
    "relative to this earlier work , our examination of the hod in this paper is more comprehensive , and our side - by - side comparison of numerical and semi - analytic results for the same cosmological model allows us to evaluate the robustness and limitations of the predictions and to better understand the physics that gives rise to them .",
    "other studies of the halo occupation distribution have focused on the connections between the hod and statistical measures of galaxy clustering .",
    "many of these studies have utilized the power of the hod formalism and the related `` halo model '' of dark matter clustering as a tool for analytic calculations @xcite , drawing on methods developed over the course of several decades @xcite .",
    "berlind & weinberg ( @xcite , hereafter bw ) computed the impact of hod bias on many of the most widely used galaxy clustering statistics by applying parameterized hod models to an n - body simulation of the @xmath3cdm scenario .",
    "they concluded that different statistics constrain the hod in complementary ways , making it possible to determine the hod empirically from observed galaxy clustering , at least for a known cosmological model .",
    "important steps toward observational determination of the hod of bright , optically selected galaxies , drawing mainly on the 2- and 3-point correlation functions , the group multiplicity function , and galaxy - galaxy lensing , have been taken by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have investigated hod constraints for galaxies selected in the near- or far - infrared , and @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have applied similar methods to high - redshift galaxies .",
    "an ambitious but , we think , realizable goal is to use the high - precision measurements afforded by the 2dfgrs and the sdss to break the `` degeneracies '' between cosmology and bias , obtaining tight , simultaneous constraints on the mass function and clustering of dark halos and the hods of many different galaxy classes ( see discussions by bw , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "we hope that the results presented here will provide inspiration to such efforts , by illustrating how measurements of the hod can test basic ideas about the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "our approach to the hod is essentially the one described by bw , which was in turn inspired largely by the discussion of benson et al .",
    "( 2000ab ) .",
    "the clustering of galaxies predicted by the semi - analytic model and hydrodynamic simulation investigated here , as quantified by more traditional statistics , has been presented in separate papers @xcite .",
    "we briefly describe the two calculations and the selection of galaxy populations in   [ models ] . in   [ pnm ] we compare the predictions of @xmath0 for several different galaxy classes , and we demonstrate that @xmath0 predicted by the hydrodynamic simulation is independent of large scale environment , to within the statistical limitations of our measurements",
    ". semi - analytic models do not predict the distribution of galaxies within halos , but clustering calculations based on these models usually assume that each halo contains one central galaxy moving at the halo s center - of - mass velocity and that other `` satellite '' galaxies trace the halo s dark matter distribution . in   [ profile ] , we show that these assumptions hold to a good approximation in the hydrodynamic simulation , which predicts the galaxy positions and velocities directly . in ",
    "[ central ] we compare the properties of central and satellite galaxies in the two methods .",
    "the precision in predictions of the galaxy correlation function by these two models has been limited by the finite size of the simulation volumes in which they were implemented . in   [ xijen ]",
    "we combine the hod results with a new , large - volume n - body simulation to make improved predictions for the galaxy correlation function , focusing on predicted departures from a power - law form . in   [ conclusions ] we summarize our results and discuss what they tell us about the physical factors that shape the hod and thereby determine the bias between galaxies and dark matter .",
    "we use a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulation of a @xmath3cdm cosmological model , with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "this model is in good agreement with a wide variety of cosmological observations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , though the value of @xmath19 is somewhat higher than favored by the most recent constraints . in terms of hod predictions , lowering @xmath19 while keeping other parameters fixed would primarily shift the mass scale of halos by a constant factor @xcite , though the change of dynamical growth timescales relative to gas cooling timescales could have a secondary influence .",
    "the simulation uses the parallel treesph code @xcite to follow the evolution of @xmath20 gas and @xmath20 dark matter particles in a @xmath21 box from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "the mass of each dark matter particle is @xmath24 , the mass of each baryonic particle is @xmath25 , and the gravitational force softening is @xmath26 ( plummer equivalent ) . as a test of numerical resolution effects , in ",
    "[ pnm ] we also show results from a simulation of a @xmath27 cube with a factor of eight higher mass resolution ( @xmath28 particles ) and a gravitational softening of @xmath29 .",
    "dark matter particles are only affected by gravity , whereas gas particles are subject to pressure gradients and shocks , in addition to gravitational forces .",
    "the treesph code includes the effects of both radiative and compton cooling .",
    "treesph also includes heating by a background uv radiation field but we only include its effects in the simulation of the @xmath27 cube .",
    "we can not accurately include a background uv radiation field at the lower resolution of the @xmath21 simulation @xcite .",
    "star formation is assumed to happen in regions that are jeans unstable and where the gas density is greater than a threshold value ( @xmath30 ) and colder than a threshold temperature ( @xmath31k ) . once gas is eligible to form stars , it does so at a rate proportional to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the gas density and @xmath34 is the longer of the gas cooling and dynamical times .",
    "gas that turns into stars becomes collisionless and releases energy back into the surrounding gas via supernova explosions .",
    "a miller - scalo ( @xcite ) initial mass function of stars is assumed , and stars of mass greater than @xmath35 become supernovae and inject @xmath36ergs of pure thermal energy into neighboring gas particles .",
    "the star formation and feedback algorithms are discussed extensively by @xcite , and the particular simulations employed here are described in greater detail by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the parameters are all chosen on the basis of a priori theoretical and numerical considerations and are not adjusted to match any observations .",
    "sph galaxies are identified at the sites of local baryonic density maxima using the skid algorithm , which selects gravitationally bound groups of star and cold , dense gas particles . because dissipation greatly increases the density contrast of these baryonic components , there is essentially no ambiguity in the identification of galaxies .",
    "we retain only those particle groups whose mass exceeds a threshold @xmath37 , corresponding to the mass of 64 sph particles , and the resulting galaxy space density is @xmath38 .",
    "we also construct lower density ( and thus more massive ) samples with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which have minimum baryonic masses of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the galaxy properties that we use in this analysis , aside from position and velocity , are the total baryonic mass and the median stellar age ( i.e. , the look - back time to the point at which half of the stellar mass had formed ) .",
    "we identify dark matter halos in the mass distribution using a friends - of - friends algorithm @xcite with a linking length of 0.173 times the mean inter - particle separation , and we only consider halos consisting of at least 32 dark matter particles .",
    "we choose this particular linking length because , for this cosmological model , it most closely corresponds to the definition of a halo assumed in the semi - analytic model described in the following section .",
    "we assume a universal baryon to matter ratio and scale halo dark matter masses up by a factor @xmath43 to obtain total halo masses .",
    "the minimum halo mass we resolve is therefore @xmath44 , and the most massive halo in our @xmath21 box is @xmath45 . finally , we decide halo membership of galaxies by assigning each galaxy to the halo that contains the dark matter particle closest to the galaxy center - of - mass .",
    "semi - analytic galaxy formation models have their roots in the work of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , who established the basic framework of this approach .",
    "the semi - analytic ( sa ) model that we use in this paper is galform , which is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the model begins with a population of halo masses that is usually either generated using the @xcite halo mass function or drawn from an n - body simulation . in this study , we supply the sa model with the same halo population identified in the sph simulation .",
    "the two methods predictions can thus be compared halo by halo without being subject to differences caused by sample variance .",
    "in addition , we produce 10 sa realizations for each sph halo so that we can determine the sa @xmath0 relation more accurately .    for each halo ,",
    "the sa model first employs a monte carlo method to generate a `` merger tree '' , which describes the hierarchical growth of that particular halo .",
    "the tree starts at @xmath23 and works backwards in time , branching into progenitor halos , until it reaches a starting redshift .",
    "the halo merger rates used by the merger tree algorithm are those derived by @xcite .",
    "the merger statistics that underpin the sa model are of particular importance to @xmath0 , since the number of galaxies in any given halo should be closely related to the formation and merger history of its progenitor halos .",
    "once a merger tree is created , a suite of analytic prescriptions is used to model the formation and evolution of galaxies in each progenitor halo , starting with the highest redshift progenitors and moving forward in time all the way to the single halo at @xmath23 .",
    "each halo is given an nfw @xcite dark matter density profile ( with no scatter in halo concentration ) and an angular momentum drawn from a log - normal distribution .",
    "diffuse gas is assumed to be shock heated to the halo virial temperature during the formation process and to settle initially into a spherical distribution .",
    "gas that is dense enough to radiate its thermal energy before the halo experiences a major merger is assumed to accrete onto a centrifugally supported disk at the halo center .",
    "this mechanism proceeds from the center of the halo outwards , since the cooling timescale is an increasing function of radius within the halo .",
    "cold gas that has settled onto the disk begins forming stars at a rate proportional to the total mass of cold disk gas and inversely proportional to an empirical timescale , which is described below .",
    "the effects of stellar winds are modeled by returning a fraction of stellar mass into the cold gas phase , and the effects of feedback are parameterized by reheating a fraction of the cold gas to the halo virial temperature and ejecting it from the disk .",
    "the sa model keeps track of how much gas is in the hot , cold , and stellar phases at any given time and traces chemical enrichment of the gas by following the exchange of metals among these three phases .",
    "if at any point during this process the merger tree contains a merger between two halos , the most massive galaxy is assumed to become the `` central '' galaxy of the merged halo and any other galaxies present become `` satellites '' .",
    "each of these satellite galaxies is assigned a random orbit and a timescale on which dynamical friction causes it to merge with the central galaxy . if such a galaxy merger happens , the central galaxy s evolution may be mildly or severely disrupted , depending on the mass ratio @xmath46 of the merging galaxies .",
    "if @xmath47 , then the merger is classified as `` major , '' and the two galaxies form an elliptical galaxy , with their remaining gas consumed in a single burst of star formation . if @xmath48 , then the star formation burst still happens , but the central galaxy disk is not destroyed . finally ,",
    "if @xmath49 , then the satellite s gas and stars are added to that of the central galaxy without disrupting it .",
    "there are several adjustable parameters in the sa model , and their values are chosen so that the model reproduces some observed properties of the local galaxy population , in particular the galaxy luminosity function . other observables then serve to test the model .",
    "the sa parameters are _ not _ adjusted on the basis of galaxy clustering measurements . @xcite and @xcite compare the galaxy properties predicted by sa calculations and sph simulations , and in these tests they adjust the sa parameters to mimic the physical assumptions and numerical resolution of the simulations . here",
    "we have chosen to take both methods `` as is '' ; the sa model incorporates its standard set of physical processes , and its parameters are adjusted on the basis of observations .",
    "the sa model computes many observable properties of galaxies such as luminosities , sizes , colors , metallicities , and morphological types .",
    "the properties that interest us here are , in addition to halo membership , the total baryonic mass and the mass - weighted mean stellar age .",
    "we will also make use of the sa bulge - to - disk ratios in  [ massage ] .",
    "while the nature of the semi - analytic model used in this work is identical to that described by @xcite , the parameters differ from those of their fiducial model because we have adopted different cosmological parameters .",
    "in particular , we adopt the baryon density parameter @xmath50 used in the sph simulation , where @xcite used @xmath51 , and we are forced to alter other model parameters to maintain a good match to local galaxy luminosity functions .",
    "the star formation timescale in the semi - analytic model is now described by @xmath52 with @xmath53gyr and @xmath54 , and the feedback parameter @xmath55 is increased to @xmath56 .",
    "we also impose a minimum star formation timescale of 1 or 25 myrs for quiescent and bursting star formation respectively .",
    "we adopt the salpeter imf and a recycled fraction @xmath57 ( our choice of imf is not particularly important for this work since we only consider the total stellar mass of galaxies , rather than their photometric properties ) .",
    "the core radius of the gas density profile in the model halos is initially set to @xmath58 of the nfw scale radius ( twice as large as in @xcite ) .",
    "we inhibit cooling of gas in dark matter halos with virial velocities below @xmath59 to mimic the effects of an ionizing background . finally ,",
    "the critical mass ratios of merging galaxies that determine when elliptical galaxies and bursts of star formation are produced have changed to the values described above ( from @xmath60 in @xcite ) .",
    "the dependence of sa model predictions on input parameters and modeling assumptions has been examined extensively in other papers ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , 2000 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we will not attempt such an investigation here , but we note that the good agreement we find between the hod predictions of the sa model and the sph simulations , two radically different calculational methods , suggests that the sa predictions themselves will not be sensitive to the modeling details , at least for models that are tuned to reproduce the observed galaxy luminosity function .    as in the sph case , we construct three galaxy samples of different space densities by only including galaxies above a baryonic mass threshold . in the sa model these thresholds are @xmath61 @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 for galaxy samples with space densities of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "these mass thresholds are approximately a factor of four lower than the corresponding sph thresholds , a difference that we discuss in the following section .",
    "figure  [ fig : ngm ] shows cumulative baryonic mass functions for sph and sa galaxies , starting at the thresholds that define our main analysis samples , with space density @xmath38 . at any given space density ,",
    "the sa galaxies are less massive by a factor of @xmath65 .",
    "the parameters of the sa model , primarily those controlling the gas core radius and stellar feedback , are chosen to produce a good fit to the observed galaxy luminosity function .",
    "as we will show later , the baryonic mass of the sa galaxies hosted by a given dark matter halo rarely exceeds 25% of the total mass of baryons within the halo virial radius . in the sph simulations , on the other hand",
    ", low mass halos frequently host a galaxy with @xmath66 , corresponding to 100% of the baryon mass within the virial radius .",
    "for observationally motivated choices of the stellar mass - to - light ratio , the resulting tully - fisher ( @xcite ) relation is in reasonable accord with observations , but the predicted luminosity function is too high ( katz et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the growing gap between the sa and sph mass functions in figure  [ fig : ngm ] is partly a consequence of numerical resolution effects in the sph simulation . a galaxy - by - galaxy comparison of two simulations in a @xmath27 cube , the @xmath28 particle simulation mentioned in ",
    "[ models : sph ] and a @xmath67 simulation that has the same resolution as our @xmath68 , @xmath21 run , indicates that the lower resolution calculations , which also do not include the effects of a photoionizing uv background , yield approximately correct masses for galaxies near the @xmath69 threshold but systematically overestimate the masses of larger galaxies , probably because of the 2-phase interface effects discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . the dotted curve in figure  [ fig : ngm ]",
    "shows the result of correcting the @xmath21 cube mass function for this effect , using an empirical formula derived from the @xmath27 simulations ( fardal et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this curve represents our best guess at the mass function we would obtain with a @xmath70 particle simulation of a @xmath21 cube including a uv background field . with this rescaling , the gap between the sph and sa mass functions is a roughly constant factor of @xmath71 . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "the weak lensing mass - to - light ratios obtained from the @xmath21 simulation ( with this rescaling ) agree fairly well with those inferred by @xcite from sdss data .",
    "the conflicting implications of the weak lensing and luminosity function comparisons remain a puzzle , at least if our choice of cosmological parameters is correct .",
    "we select galaxy samples above baryon mass thresholds , but we characterize these samples by their space density @xmath72 rather than the mass threshold itself",
    ". the membership in a given sample , and thus the hod , would be unchanged by any monotonic rescaling of galaxy masses .",
    "the discrepancy of sa and sph baryon mass functions reflects the combined impact of differing physical assumptions ( e.g. , regarding stellar feedback ) , the approximations in the sa method , and the numerical limitations of the sph simulation .",
    "we will not attempt to disentangle these contributions here , but we will show that the two approaches nonetheless give similar predictions for the clustering of galaxy samples at common space density .",
    "figure  [ fig : xi ] shows the most commonly studied galaxy clustering statistic , the two - point correlation function , for the two @xmath38 galaxy samples and for the dark matter in the sph simulation .",
    "we compute the correlation function of sa galaxies by populating the sph dark matter halos with sa galaxies assuming that , in every halo that contains one or more galaxies , the first galaxy is located at the center of mass of the halo and any remaining galaxies trace the dark matter distribution within the halo .",
    "the plotted correlation function of sa galaxies is the mean @xmath73 of the 10 sa realizations , and the plotted error bars show the uncertainty in the mean ; the @xmath74 dispersion from one @xmath0 realization to another is a factor of @xmath75 larger .",
    "the sa error bars therefore illustrate the uncertainty due to fluctuations in @xmath0 , but they do not include uncertainty due to the finite number of large scale structures in the @xmath21 cube .",
    "the sph error bars , on the other hand , are computed by jackknife resampling using the eight octants of the simulation cube ( see @xcite ) , and they are dominated by the `` cosmic variance '' in these large scale structures . for comparison , we show a power law with the parameters derived for @xmath76 galaxies in the 2df redshift survey @xcite .",
    "the dark matter correlation function shows the steepening at @xmath77 and levelling off at @xmath78 that has been found in most n - body studies ( e.g. , @xcite , though the deviation from a power law there is stronger than here due to a larger value of @xmath79 ) .",
    "both the sph and sa models have correlation functions that are closer to a straight power law from @xmath80 , although , like the dark matter , they show a kink at that larger scale .",
    "the difference between the model galaxy and dark matter correlation functions is difficult to see because of the small size of the simulation box .",
    "this difference stands out more strongly when we use the sph and sa hods to populate a larger volume n - body simulation ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xijen ] ) .",
    "the low amplitude of the model @xmath73 at scales larger than @xmath81 compared to the 2df points in figure  [ fig : xi ] is partly a consequence of the particular realization of structure in this @xmath21 volume @xcite and partly due to the fact that our @xmath82 threshold corresponds to a population of galaxies less luminous than @xmath76 .",
    "the comparison of the sph @xmath73 to observations is discussed at greater length by @xcite .",
    "the correlation functions of the two models differ slightly , with the sa model having a higher amplitude of @xmath73 on scales smaller than @xmath83 and a somewhat more pronounced feature around @xmath84 . from @xmath73 alone",
    ", it is difficult to say what differences in galaxy formation physics are responsible for these differences in clustering . with the hod analysis that follows",
    ", we will see that the small scale difference arises mainly from the greater representation of galaxies in the highest mass halos predicted by the sa model .",
    "we now turn to the primary results of this study , comparison of the @xmath0 predicted by the sph and sa models . unless we specify otherwise , the results we show are for the galaxy samples constructed to have a space density of @xmath38 , corresponding to galaxies brighter than @xmath85 for the @xcite @xmath86-band luminosity function or the @xcite @xmath87-band luminosity function .",
    "figure  [ fig : pnm ] shows @xmath88 predicted by the sph model ( top panel ) and a single realization of the sa model ( bottom panel ) .",
    "each point represents the number of galaxies in a specific halo , and the solid curve shows the mean @xmath5 and its statistical uncertainty , computed in bins of halo mass . the general features that can be seen in @xmath4 ( we use this notation to denote the mean occupation as a function of halo mass ) for both models are a sharp drop in the fraction of halos that contain a galaxy for halos of mass less than @xmath89 and a slope that increases from roughly @xmath90 to @xmath91 as @xmath1 gets larger .",
    "this behavior is similar to that of the broken power - law @xmath4 shown by bw to produce a good match to the observed galaxy correlation function ( their fig .",
    "9 ) . for halos with @xmath92 ,",
    "the distribution @xmath10 is close to a `` nearest integer '' ( hereafter nint ) distribution with only two possible multiplicities , 0 and 1 or 1 and 2 . given that the former is integer valued and the latter is not .",
    "the general definition is @xmath93 @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the integer satisfying @xmath96 , with @xmath97 for all other values of @xmath2 . ]",
    "the scatter in @xmath10 is larger at higher masses  for example , a @xmath98 halo may have @xmath99 galaxies  but we will show that the scatter remains significantly below that of a poisson distribution up to @xmath100 .",
    "overall , the results in figure  [ fig : pnm ] are in qualitative agreement with results from other hydrodynamic simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and semi - analytic calculations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we compare the @xmath4 relations predicted by the sph and sa models in figure  [ fig : n ] .",
    "the result for the sa model is the average over the 10 sa realizations , resulting in smaller error bars , especially at @xmath101 where there are only two halos in the sph simulation .",
    "also shown is the relation @xmath102 , normalized so that @xmath103 at the same mass as the sph and sa models ( dotted line ) .",
    "the agreement between the two predicted @xmath4 relations is strikingly good .",
    "they have roughly the same cutoff at low mass and the same shape and amplitude across more than two orders of magnitude in halo mass .",
    "the only notable differences are that the sph simulation predicts a slightly sharper cutoff at low masses and slightly fewer galaxies on average in the highest mass halos , though with a single sph realization it is not clear that this latter discrepancy is statistically significant .",
    "our matching of number densities requires that the integrals @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the halo mass function , be equal in the two models , but it clearly does not enforce the detailed agreement seen in figure  [ fig : n ] .",
    "we expect a low mass cutoff in @xmath4 simply because lower mass halos do not contain enough gas to form a galaxy of baryonic mass greater than @xmath106 , the baryonic mass threshold of our sample .",
    "if the ratio of galaxy baryonic mass to halo mass were equal to the universal baryon - to - matter ratio , the minimum halo mass would be @xmath107 .",
    "the vertical arrow in figure  [ fig : n ] marks this halo mass for the value of @xmath106 that defines the sph galaxy sample .",
    "since this arrow nearly coincides with the sharp drop in @xmath4 , we conclude that many low mass halos in the sph simulation cool essentially all of the gas within the virial radius into a single galaxy .",
    "the @xmath4 relation of the sa model also cuts off at this halo mass , but in this case the value of @xmath106 is four times smaller , implying that these galaxies contain only @xmath108 of the baryons within the virial radius . as discussed in  [ models : xi ] , we attribute this difference to the impact of the stellar feedback parameters in the sa model , which are chosen to match the observed galaxy luminosity function . for the lowest mass halos in the sa model , feedback results in approximately four solar masses of gas ejected from galaxy disks for every one solar mass of stars formed .",
    "therefore , these halos cool gas with high efficiency , and feedback then determines how much cold gas is allowed to remain in galaxies and form stars .",
    "the sa low mass cutoff is nearly as sharp as the sph cutoff because the feedback mechanism is tightly correlated with halo mass , so galaxies in sa halos never retain more than @xmath108 of their gas .",
    "following the low mass cutoff , there is a low occupancy regime ( @xmath109 ) in which the mean number of galaxies rises slowly , growing from one to two over a decade in halo mass . in this regime ,",
    "halos `` spend '' their larger gas supplies on building a more massive galaxy rather than building multiple low mass galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : mgavg]a demonstrates this point , showing the average baryonic mass @xmath110 of galaxies in each halo , averaged in bins of halo mass .",
    "although there is a large offset in galaxy mass between the two models , both the sph and sa models predict a steady increase in @xmath110 in the low occupancy regime , leveling off at @xmath111 .",
    "continuing to more massive halos , we enter a high occupancy regime where @xmath4 steepens , though the slope remains less than unity except perhaps at the very highest masses .",
    "this steepening marks a transition from a regime where much of the cooling gas is channeled to one or two galaxies to a regime in which halos are built by merging smaller halos whose pre - existing galaxies survive , for the most part , as distinct entities .",
    "the transition presumably reflects the relative timescales for gas cooling and major halo mergers . a mismatch between the scales of filaments and galaxies in high mass halos",
    "may also play a role in this transition , with filaments of large geometrical cross - section no longer able to funnel cooled gas directly onto galaxies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "dynamical friction may also be more effective at bringing together the galaxies of merged halos in the low mass regime .",

    "[ fig : pnm ] ) .",
    "since the cutoff in @xmath4 at @xmath132 is quite sharp , the former result can be understood largely in terms of mass supply : halos with @xmath132 do not have enough cold baryons to make two galaxies above the mass threshold .",

    "the top two dotted curves show the expectations for poisson statistics , @xmath164 .",
    "analogous to the factorial moment results , it is clear that the probability of a high mass halo being empty is far lower than poisson statistics would imply .",
    "in fact , the sph and sa results are almost perfectly described by the nint distribution ( bottom two dotted curves ) , for which @xmath165 ; only the low amplitude ( @xmath166 ) tail of the sph prediction for @xmath167 deviates noticeably from this result .",

    "the transition is slightly more gradual in the sa model , as one might expect , since the sph cutoff is driven by the universal baryon fraction while the sa cutoff is determined by the physical processes that suppress gas cooling , whose operation depends to some extent on the halo s formation history .",

    "figure  [ fig : nage ] shows the mean occupation @xmath4 predicted by the sph and sa models for galaxies in four quartiles of stellar population age , which should correlate tightly with color or spectral type .",

    "although there are differences between the sph and sa predictions in individual age quartiles , the agreement on the qualitative dependence of @xmath4 on galaxy age is remarkably good .",
    "old galaxies have a steep @xmath4 relation , with most galaxies occupying high multiplicity halos , whereas young galaxies have a shallow @xmath4 and reside primarily in single galaxy halos . in the language",
    "more commonly used to describe the environmental dependence of galaxy types , both calculations predict that old / red / early - type galaxies reside preferentially in clusters and that young / blue / late - type galaxies reside mainly in the field .",

    "first , gravitational collapse and galaxy assembly begin earlier in the overdense regions that eventually form massive halos .",
    "second , gas accretion largely shuts off when a galaxy s parent halo merges into a more massive halo , starving the galaxy of the fuel that it would need to make young stars .",
    "the galaxies that are in high mass halos today started forming their stars early , and they stopped forming them some time ago",
    ".    the sph simulation does not resolve galaxy morphology , but the sa model does track morphology , assigning post - merger stellar populations to bulge components as described in  [ models : sa ] .",
    "galaxy color and morphological type are correlated with environment in similar ways .",
    "nonetheless , the physics that determines morphology is different from the physics that governs stellar population age , and it is interesting to ask whether the sa model predicts a morphological dependence of clustering that is distinguishable from the age dependence .",
    "dotted curves in figure  [ fig : nage ] show the sa predictions for galaxy quartiles defined by bulge - to - disk ratios ( in stellar mass ) rather than by stellar population age . while there is a fair amount of galaxy - by - galaxy scatter between mean stellar age and bulge - to - disk ratio , the two ways of characterizing galaxy type display similar mean occupation functions .",
    "the sa model thus predicts that the morphological dependence of clustering will closely track the age dependence of clustering .",
    "closer inspection of figure  [ fig : nage ] reveals interesting structure in the sa @xmath4 curves that is significant relative to the error bars . for the youngest quartile",

    "the next two quartiles show similar peaks in @xmath4 , at @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "these peaks represent the contribution of the halos central galaxies , the ages of which are correlated with the halo masses .",
    "young central galaxies form in low mass halos , and the mean occupation for these galaxies declines toward higher halo mass as the central galaxy age moves out of the youngest quartile and into the second quartile , and so on for the third .",
    "the oldest quartile has a very low plateau for low halo masses because the galaxies of these halos are almost always younger ; then there is a sharp rise when the halo mass gets high enough that central galaxies can be in the oldest quartile .",
    "a similar peak at low halo masses for young / blue galaxies is also seen in the gif semi - analytic models of @xcite , and it is modeled as a gaussian bump by @xcite and @xcite . while the behavior of the sph @xmath4 curves is similar , the structure is much less pronounced , indicating that the sph calculation produces more scatter between halo mass and central galaxy age .",
    "some of this difference could arise from the different age definitions , though there is no obvious reason that median ages would exhibit more scatter than mean ages .",
    "the existence of local maxima in @xmath4 means that our fitting formula  ( [ eqn : nfit ] ) does not describe the age quartile results accurately , so we do not attempt to perform fits for these samples .",
    "figure  [ fig : nnage ] shows that the sph and sa models predict qualitatively similar pair counts @xmath127 for the age quartiles , though the results are fairly noisy . as with the mean",
    "occupation , age and bulge - to - disk divisions produce similar results for the sa model .",
    "overall , the strong age dependence of @xmath0 implies that both sph simulations and sa models predict a strong dependence of galaxy clustering on stellar population age .",
    "the similarity of the predicted trends indicates that these dependences will be similar for the two methods , for all clustering statistics .",
    "top panels of figure  [ fig : nage2 ] show the mean occupation for young , old , and all galaxies in the sph and sa models , when the @xmath38 sample is divided into two halves according to age . while the quartile division demonstrates the steadiness of trends with age , this division in two yields more statistically robust predictions that can be tested against , for example , the red and blue halves of a volume - limited galaxy sample .",
    "for both the sph and sa calculations , the mean occupation of older galaxies is close to a power law truncated at @xmath113 , and the slowly rising regime of the total @xmath4 curve comes from adding this power law to the much flatter occupation curve of young galaxies .",
    "the sa model predicts that in the high halo mass regime ( @xmath184 ) , the power - law slope of @xmath4 for both old and young galaxies is equal to that of @xmath4 for all galaxies .",
    "this suggests that the fraction of young to old galaxies is constant in this regime .",
    "this behavior is seen in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : nage2]b , which shows the fraction of young galaxies in halos as a function of halo mass .",
    "the sa model predicts that the young fraction drops steadily from 90% to 10% as halo mass increases from the minimum cutoff mass to @xmath185 , and then levels off at 10% for greater masses . the sph model prediction for the young fraction ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nage2]a ) shows no clear evidence for this high mass plateau , but it is too noisy to tell for sure .",
    "the mass dependence of the sa young fraction differs from that of the `` late - type fraction '' parameterization assumed by @xcite , which is forced to zero at high halo masses .",
    "the claim that the hod formalism offers a complete description of galaxy bias hinges on a key assumption : if we know , statistically , how galaxies occupy halos of given mass , then we can predict all aspects of galaxy clustering given a halo population .",
    "this assumption would break down if halos of the same mass in different large scale environments had systematically different galaxy populations .",
    "the excursion set model @xcite predicts that the statistics of a halo s progenitor population and merger history depend only on its mass , not on its environment .",
    "the sa model employed here is based on excursion set merger trees , so it necessarily incorporates no direct dependence of galaxy population on halo environment .",
    "the analysis of n - body simulations by @xcite shows that halos of the same mass in different environments have similar properties and formation histories , providing substantial support for this approach . nonetheless , it is desirable to revisit this central issue with a simulation that includes the gas dynamics and dissipation that play key roles in galaxy formation .",
    "figure  [ fig : env ] shows @xmath4 for the sph galaxy populations of halos in different bins of large scale density .",
    "the density around each halo is found by smoothing the dark matter distribution with a top - hat filter of radius @xmath186 .",
    "as expected , the low density bins only probe @xmath4 in the low halo mass regime , and successively higher density bins probe @xmath4 to higher masses , demonstrating the expected shift of the halo mass function with environment ( see @xcite ) . the main result",
    ", however , is unambiguous : the mean halo occupation of galaxies is completely independent of the larger scale environment .",
    "the same is true for @xmath127 , although we do not plot that result here .",
    "we thus conclude that , to the extent that the sph simulation includes the most important macroscopic galaxy formation physics , the claim that the hod is a complete formulation of galaxy bias is well founded .",
    "the large scale relative bias between early and late type galaxies , predicted by both the sa and sph approaches @xcite arises entirely from the dependence of the halo mass function on large scale environment , not from changes in galaxy populations at fixed halo mass .",
    "in this section we investigate the second component of the hod : the relative spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos .",
    "the spatial bias of galaxies within halos has a more limited impact on galaxy clustering than @xmath0 because its effect is restricted to scales smaller than halo virial diameters .",
    "nevertheless , internal spatial biases can have an important effect on small scale clustering , such as the correlation function at separations @xmath187 ( bw , fig .",
    "6 ) . systematic differences between galaxy and dark matter velocity dispersions within halos , a.k.a .",
    "velocity bias , can have a major impact on redshift space clustering even at very large scales ( bw , figs .",
    "15 and 16 ) .",
    "while the sa model treats presumed central galaxies differently from satellites , it does not directly predict spatial or velocity distributions within halos . clustering predictions based on the combination of sa modeling with n - body simulations often assume that the central galaxy resides at the halo center of mass and moves with the halo center of mass velocity , and that satellites trace the dark matter spatial and velocity distribution ( e.g. , kauffmann et al . 1997 ; benson et al .",
    "@xcite adopt a somewhat different procedure , in which satellite galaxies trace the most bound particle of their parent halo , leaving some internal bias @xcite . in the sph simulation",
    ", we can investigate internal biases in a calculation that includes the full effects of gas dynamics , dynamical friction , and galaxy mergers .",
    "figure  [ fig : cen]a plots the distribution @xmath188 vs. @xmath1 , where @xmath189 is the halo virial radius and @xmath190 is the distance from the halo center of mass to the galaxy that is closest to it .",
    "each point represents an individual halo , the central solid curve shows the mean @xmath188 in mass bins , and the upper and lower solid curves enclose 60% of the points . on average ,",
    "the centermost galaxy of a halo resides within @xmath191 of the halo center of mass . to obtain corresponding predictions for the case in which galaxies trace mass within halos , we randomly select from each halo a number of dark matter particles equal to the number of galaxies @xmath2 .",
    "we tag the selected particle closest to the center of mass as the `` placebo '' particle , and we repeat the process several times to improve statistics . dashed curves in figure  [ fig : cen]a mark the mean and central 60% of the distributions of @xmath192 in bins of halo mass .",
    "comparison to the solid curves demonstrates that the center - most galaxies in the sph halos are indeed a distinct , `` central '' population , whose proximity to the center of mass would not be expected if galaxies randomly traced the dark matter .",
    "the distinction between central galaxies and placebo particles is less clear at large @xmath1 , but in these high mass halos , substructure near the virial radius may shift the center of mass position .",
    "the location of the most bound dark matter particle or a local density maximum provides a more physically robust indicator of the halo center .",
    "however , we began with the center - of - mass definition because the most bound dark matter particle is almost guaranteed to lie near the center of a massive galaxy , and with this definition of the halo center one might erroneously infer the existence of `` central '' galaxies even if galaxies traced the overall dark matter distribution within halos .",
    "figure  [ fig : cen]b is the same as figure  [ fig : cen]a except that the halo center is identified as the position of the most bound dark matter particle ( specifically , the particle with the lowest potential energy , computed using the halo s dark matter particles only ) instead of the center of mass . for the great majority of halos , this particle lies within @xmath191 of the center of mass .",
    "as expected , the @xmath188 distribution is much narrower with the most - bound - particle definition of halo center , while the @xmath192 distribution is hardly changed .",
    "since figure  [ fig : cen]a convincingly establishes the existence of central galaxies , we will henceforth use the more reliable most - bound - particle definition to identify which galaxies are central .",
    "what about satellite (",
    "i.e. , non - central ) galaxies ?",
    "figure  [ fig : nr ] compares the radial profiles of satellite galaxies ( solid curves ) to those of dark matter ( dashed curves ) , in four halo mass bins .",
    "here we define profiles as the fraction of objects in bins of @xmath193 . in all cases",
    ", the radial distribution of satellite galaxies traces that of dark matter within halos fairly well .",
    "however , there is marginal evidence of a central core in the galaxy distribution relative to that of the dark matter .",
    "there are no satellite galaxies in the lowest halo mass bin ( panel  d ) because these halos never have more than one galaxy .",
    "we now consider the relative velocities of galaxies and dark matter within halos .",
    "for every sph galaxy , we measure @xmath194 , the magnitude of its velocity relative to the halo center - of - mass velocity .",
    "we then average these measurements in bins of @xmath193 , where @xmath86 is the galaxy s distance from the halo center ( most bound particle ) .",
    "we do the same for all dark matter particles .",
    "dividing these two functions gives the `` velocity bias '' parameter @xmath195 as a function of radius within halos , similar to the @xmath196 parameter defined by bw ( which was assumed to be constant with radius ) .",

    "central galaxies have velocities that are substantially colder than the dark matter , as expected  if they did not , then they would not remain close to the center .",
    "note that if the central galaxy is identified with the most bound dark matter particle , its velocity should still be set to the center - of - mass velocity ; this difference can have an important effect on velocity dispersion statistics @xcite . to a good approximation",
    ", satellite galaxies trace the dark matter velocity distribution , though they exhibit a mild velocity bias @xmath199 in @xmath200 halos and @xmath201 in @xmath202 halos .",
    "overall , the sph simulation supports a simple characterization of the galaxy distributions within halos : there is always one galaxy at the center of each halo ( defined by the center of mass or , better , by the location of the most bound dark matter particle ) that moves at approximately the center - of - mass velocity , and any remaining satellite galaxies trace the spatial and velocity distribution of the dark matter .",
    "this is just the characterization that has been used for most calculations of galaxy clustering from sa / n - body models , and the only amendment that our sph results suggest is a mild velocity bias of satellites in intermediate mass halos and perhaps a small central core in the galaxy distribution .",
    "here we have presented results for the whole @xmath38 sample , but we find that these results also hold for the lower space density samples .",

    "furthermore , both models predict that central galaxies are substantially more massive than their satellites and that this difference increases with halo mass .",
    "this qualitative behavior is expected in a scenario where the galaxies at the centers of large halos grow by accreting smaller galaxies .",
    "central galaxies are also better positioned to accrete cooling gas , since they sit at the maximum of the gas density profile  in the sa model , it is assumed that central galaxies accrete gas but satellite galaxies do not .",
    "our definition of sph halo centers as the locations of the most bound dark matter particles tends to favor high masses for `` central '' galaxies on its own , but figure  [ fig : cenmass ] does not look very different if we use a center - of - mass definition instead , though in this case there are some outliers at high @xmath1 , which occur when substructure puts the center of mass closer to a low mass satellite .    as we have already seen in  [ models : xi ] , the sph simulation predicts much higher galaxy masses than the sa model . for @xmath204 ,",
    "the baryonic mass of a typical sph central galaxy is close to the halo mass multiplied by the universal baryon fraction ( dotted line ) .",
    "some galaxies in this regime lie above the dotted line , indicating that they have accreted some gas from beyond the virial volume represented by the friends - of - friends halo . at high @xmath203 ,",
    "sph galaxy masses are probably overestimated because of the resolution effects discussed in  [ models : xi ] . correcting for this effect would make little difference to central galaxies at low @xmath1 , but it would produce a sharper turnover in the trend of @xmath203 vs.  @xmath1 at high @xmath1 , making the gap between the sph and sa predictions roughly independent of halo mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : cenage ] shows the distribution of stellar ages for central ( top panel ) and satellite ( bottom panel ) galaxies , in a format similar to figure  [ fig : cenmass ] .",
    "both models predict a clear correlation of central galaxy age with halo mass",
    ". satellite galaxy ages also correlate with @xmath1 , but not as strongly . as previously discussed in ",
    "[ massage ] , these trends reflect the earlier onset of structure formation in regions that become high mass halos and the decline of gas accretion rates for galaxies that reside in halos of high circular velocity .",
    "the age scales in the sph and sa calculations agree reasonably well , though since they represent median ages for sph galaxies and mean ages for sa galaxies , we would not expect perfect agreement in any case .",
    "figures  [ fig : cenmass ] and  [ fig : cenage ] show that central galaxies are generally more massive and older than average satellites in the same halo .",
    "figure  [ fig : dmda ] addresses a related but distinct question : is the central galaxy the most massive and oldest galaxy in the halo ?",
    "the top panel shows @xmath205 , the logarithmic difference in mass between the central galaxy and the most massive non - central galaxy in the halo .",
    "the bottom panel shows the age difference between the central galaxy and the oldest non - central galaxy .",
    "points show individual sph halos , and solid and dashed curves show mean results in bins of halo mass for the sph and sa models , respectively .",
    "the central galaxy is consistently the most massive galaxy in the halo , with both models predicting an average offset of @xmath206dex in halos with @xmath181 .",
    "the decline in @xmath205 at lower @xmath1 is partly enforced by our baryonic mass threshold , since halos that have only one galaxy above the threshold ( and `` satellites '' below it ) do not make it onto the plot .",
    "the sph central galaxies are frequently the oldest in the halo , but the oldest satellite is only slightly younger on average , and sometimes it is older .",
    "the sa model predicts little mean age difference between the central galaxy and the oldest satellite . in the most massive halos ,",
    "the central galaxy is younger than the oldest satellite , presumably because it continues to accrete gas and form stars . at a qualitative level ,",
    "the predictions of both models are consistent with the fact that observed central galaxies in massive groups and clusters are usually luminous ellipticals or cd galaxies .",
    "bw showed that , in the context of hod models of galaxy bias , the observed power - law form of the galaxy correlation function must emerge from a delicate balance of several competing effects .",
    "the low mass cutoff of @xmath4 , the high mass slope of @xmath4 , the width of the @xmath10 distribution , and the spatial distribution of galaxies within halos each affect @xmath207 in different ways . a power - law @xmath207 requires , at the least , a smooth connection between the 1-halo and 2-halo contributions to the galaxy pair counts , and compatible logarithmic slopes in the 1-halo and 2-halo regimes .",
    "figure  [ fig : xi ] shows that the hods predicted by the sph and sa models achieve such an alignment , since both methods predict a correlation function that is roughly consistent with a power law for galaxies of space density @xmath38 .",
    "however , since the emergence of the power law is somewhat fortuitous , we expect that sufficiently precise predictions would show departures from a pure power law shape .",
    "these departures are hidden in figure  [ fig : xi ] by the relatively large error bars , which in turn reflect the limited volume of our single , @xmath21 simulation cube .    to improve the statistical precision of our @xmath207 predictions ,",
    "we bootstrap the hod results derived from this @xmath21 volume into a larger volume n - body simulation . since @xmath0 does not depend on the larger scale environment of halos ( as shown in   [ env ] ) , the hods encode all the information needed to create new galaxy distributions that have the clustering properties predicted by the sph and sa models .",
    "we ran an n - body simulation , using version 1.1 of the parallel gadget code @xcite , with the same cosmological parameters and initial power spectrum used for the sph and sa models ( described in   [ models ] ) .",
    "the simulation follows the evolution of @xmath208 dark matter particles in a @xmath209 box , with a particle mass about twice that of dark matter particles in the sph simulation .",
    "the gravitational softening length is @xmath210 .",
    "we identify dark matter halos using a friends - of - friends algorithm with a linking length of 0.173 times the mean inter - particle separation ( exactly as we did for the sph simulation ) .",
    "we populate each halo with a number of galaxies drawn from the @xmath0 distributions predicted by the sph and sa models . in the high halo mass regime",
    ", the sph model makes no direct prediction of @xmath0 because the simulation volume does not contain enough high mass halos , and we have not computed sa predictions for halo masses not represented in the simulation . in this regime , therefore , we use the fitting formula of equation  ( [ eqn : nfit ] ) with the parameter values in table  1 to compute @xmath5 , and we draw a number of galaxies assuming a poisson @xmath10 distribution .",
    "the latter assumption is reasonable because we have shown that both models predict poisson pair counts @xmath127 in high mass halos ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nn ] ) .",
    "once we have determined @xmath2 for a given halo , we place the first galaxy at the center of mass of the halo and any remaining galaxies at the locations of random dark matter particles within the halo .",
    "once again , these are reasonable assumptions given our results on the spatial distribution of galaxies within halos in   [ profile ] .",
    "in this way , we create galaxy distributions in the @xmath209 box using the hods predicted by the sph and sa models for galaxies of space densities @xmath211 , and @xmath170 .",
    "figure  [ fig : xijen ] shows the correlation functions for these bootstrapped galaxy distributions . to investigate departures from a power - law shape",
    ", we have divided @xmath207 by the power law @xmath212 , and we use logarithmic axes so that power laws of other slopes would still be straight lines in the plot .",
    "errors in the mean estimated from jackknife resampling using the eight octants of the cube are shown for the @xmath38 samples .",
    "the errors are highly correlated , as one can see from the smoothness of the curves relative to the size of the error bars .",
    "nonetheless , these error bars are small enough to reveal interesting features that were not evident before . in all cases",
    ", @xmath207 dips below a power - law extrapolation at @xmath213 , then rises more steeply from @xmath214 to @xmath215 before returning to the original power law at still smaller scales .",
    "the inflection at @xmath213 arises at the transition between the 2-halo term , which flattens ( toward smaller @xmath86 ) and eventually cuts off on the scales of halo virial radii , and the 1-halo term , which rises steeply for @xmath86 close to the virial radii of the most massive halos ( see , e.g. , bw fig .",
    "the predicted departures are stronger for more massive galaxy samples with lower space densities , and figure  [ fig : xijen ] shows that even the small difference between the sph and sa hods is enough to have a significant quantitative impact , with the sph model predicting stronger departures from a power law . for the high space density sample ,",
    "the difference between the sph and sa correlation functions is caused mainly by the difference in the high mass slopes of @xmath4 , but for the low space density samples , differences in the cutoff and plateau regime dominate .",
    "we have also investigated the impact on the predicted @xmath207 of assuming a nearest - integer distribution for all halo masses instead of using the true predicted @xmath10 .",
    "we find that assuming a nint distribution at all masses leads to an underestimate of @xmath207 by @xmath216 at @xmath217 for @xmath38 , growing to @xmath218 for the lower space densities .",
    "figure  [ fig : xijen2 ] shows predicted correlation functions for the old and young halves of the sph and sa @xmath38 samples . as before , these were computed by populating the larger volume n - body simulation with galaxies using the predicted @xmath0 for old and young galaxies ( of which the mean occupations are seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nage2 ] ) . in the high halo mass regime , where we do not have secure calculations of @xmath0 because of our limited number of halos",
    ", we compute @xmath5 by extrapolation , and we draw a number of galaxies assuming a poisson @xmath10 distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : xijen2 ] also shows the 1-halo terms for old and young galaxies .",
    "the most striking difference between old and young galaxies is that the 1-halo term for young galaxies is severely depressed in amplitude compared to that for old galaxies .",
    "this depression is caused by a very high fraction of young galaxies that are isolated in their own halos . as a consequence , the 1-halo and 2-halo terms for young galaxies meet , and",
    "thus create a feature in @xmath73 , at a much smaller scale ( @xmath219 ) than for old galaxies .",
    "the depression in the young 1-halo term predicted by the sa model is stronger than the sph one , due to the lower fraction of young galaxies in high multiplicity halos seen in figure  [ fig : nage2 ] .",
    "most observational measurements of the galaxy correlation function have appeared consistent with a power law on scales @xmath220 ( e.g. , @xcite ; and numerous references therein ) , though there have been suggestions of a `` shoulder '' or flattening in the range @xmath221 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the theoretical predictions ( here and in earlier papers ) suggest that departures from a pure power law should be measurable at sufficiently high precision , with the generic expectation being an inflection in @xmath207 near the scale of the 1-halo to 2-halo transition . motivated in part by these predictions ,",
    "@xcite have recently examined the projected correlation function of luminous @xmath222 galaxies from the sdss .",
    "they find a statistically significant departure from a power law of just this predicted form .",
    "the space density of the zehavi et al .  sample is lower than that of our highest mass - threshold sample , so we can not directly test the results shown in figure  [ fig : xijen ] , but their measurements can be well fit by an hod model that is qualitatively similar to that found here . @xcite",
    "have shown that the projected correlation functions of 2dfgrs galaxies can also be fit well by hod models . as figures  [ fig : xijen ] and  [ fig : xijen2 ]",
    "show , the sph and sa models make a number of distinctive predictions about the dependence of the correlation function amplitude and shape on galaxy mass and age , and these predictions can be tested in the near future .",
    "the sph and sa predictions of the galaxy hod agree remarkably well .",
    "the qualitative features of these predictions can , for the most part , be readily interpreted in terms of galaxy formation physics .",
    "the mean occupation function for galaxies above a mass threshold has a cutoff , a slowly rising plateau , and a steeper `` high occupancy '' regime . in the sph simulation , the cutoff",
    "is determined by the universal baryon fraction . in the sa model ,",
    "the cutoff occurs at a substantially higher mass than the universal baryon fraction requires , corresponding to only @xmath22325% of the gas in low mass halos remaining in galaxies .",
    "this is due to the feedback mechanism , which in the sa model is tuned to produce the observed galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the cutoff is nearly as sharp in the sa model as in the sph simulation because feedback is tightly regulated by halo mass , with no scatter that allows some low mass halos to retain substantially more than @xmath22325% of their baryons . in the low occupancy regime ,",
    "@xmath5 rises slowly with @xmath1 because additional mass tends to go into making more massive single galaxies instead of multiple low mass galaxies .",
    "the logarithmic slope of @xmath4 steepens for @xmath224 , presumably representing a transition to a regime in which the galaxies in a halo were formed mostly in the lower mass progenitor halos that merged to create it . even in this regime",
    ", the slope is below unity , since the overall efficiency of galaxy formation ( fraction of mass in galaxies ) is lower in high mass halos , probably a consequence of longer cooling times and less efficient filamentary `` channeling '' of gas into galaxies . for higher baryonic mass thresholds , the mean occupation function shifts horizontally along the @xmath225 axis ,",
    "so this physical explanation of its form is not sensitive to the particular threshold adopted .",
    "since the considerations that account for the form of @xmath4 are quite general , it is perhaps not surprising that the sph and sa calculations agree . more impressive",
    "is the agreement on fluctuations about the mean occupation .",
    "both calculations predict pair counts well below the expectation for poisson fluctuations at low mass , close to those of the minimal fluctuation , nearest - integer model .",
    "as many authors have emphasized ( @xcite ; bw ) , these sub - poisson fluctuations are essential in understanding the power - law form of the observed galaxy correlation function .",
    "triple counts are also substantially sub - poisson , though not minimal , and the two calculations again agree .",
    "the explanation of sub - poisson fluctuations is not trivial , but it clearly has to do with statistics of halo merger histories and the timescales of galaxy mergers following halo mergers .",
    "in particular , near equal - mass halo mergers are rare enough that one must go substantially above the cutoff mass @xmath113 ( by a factor @xmath226 ) before one is likely to get two galaxies above the mass threshold in a single halo , instead of one , more massive , galaxy .",
    "the probability of empty halos follows the nearest - integer prediction , @xmath165 , almost exactly in both models .",
    "because the cutoff of @xmath4 is somewhat sharper in the sph calculation , the transition from occupied halos to empty halos ( at the specified baryonic mass threshold ) is also somewhat sharper , occurring over about a factor of two in halo mass . for masses above the cutoff , the probability that a halo is empty is much lower than the poisson expectation @xmath227 . in this regime , strongly sub - poisson statistics indicate the regularity of the formation process in single - galaxy halos , which produces a tight correlation between galaxy mass and halo mass .",
    "the mean occupation is very different for galaxies in different age quartiles , at both the low and high mass ends of @xmath4 .",
    "young galaxies are rare in high mass halos and vice versa .",
    "this difference reflects a tendency for star formation to begin early in regions that will become part of high mass halos and for star formation to shut off when a galaxy falls into a halo of larger virial mass , or to slow down when the halo size or virial temperature becomes too large .",
    "the qualitative agreement between the sph and sa calculations is again not surprising , but the degree of quantitative agreement is impressive .",
    "the sph simulation also shows that the mean occupation function is independent of the large scale environment of the halo , extending to the galaxy regime the result that @xcite found for the merger histories of dark matter halos .",
    "this is a fundamental and encouraging result , supporting the assumption made in merger - tree based sa methods , and supporting the claim that the hod provides a statistically complete description of galaxy bias .",
    "a detailed analysis of the sph simulation also supports simple assumptions about the galaxy distribution within halos .",
    "most halos have a galaxy near the center of mass moving at close to the center - of - mass velocity .",
    "the central galaxy is almost always the most massive galaxy in the halo , and it is usually among the oldest galaxies in the halo . the remaining , satellite galaxies have the same spatial and velocity distribution as the dark matter , except for a small ( @xmath228 ) velocity bias in intermediate mass halos .",
    "these assumptions are thus reasonable to use when making galaxy clustering predictions , and they are the ones usually incorporated in studies that combine n - body and semi - analytic methods ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the long term , these predictions can be tested empirically using clustering and galaxy - galaxy lensing data of the sort provided by 2dfgrs and sdss .    as we have emphasized in separate papers on the sa model and sph simulation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the complex relation between galaxies and mass is crucial in reproducing the observed nearly power - law form of the galaxy correlation function , since the dark matter @xmath207 is not a power law in cdm - type models .",
    "since the emergence of the power law is to some extent a coincidence , the hod framework generically predicts that there should be departures from a power - law @xmath207 once it is measured with sufficient precision , especially if one considers different subclasses of galaxies .",
    "we have tried to predict these departures by bootstrapping our results into a larger volume n - body simulation .",
    "the small differences between the sa and sph @xmath0 translate into noticeable differences in the predicted @xmath207 , and the accuracy of the sph prediction is still limited to some extent by the small number of high mass halos in the sph volume . however",
    ", improved statistics show that both models predict an inflection in @xmath207 at @xmath213 , with the departures from a power law being stronger for the sph model than for the sa model and stronger for more massive galaxies in both cases .",
    "recent observational analyses provide evidence for just such a feature in the correlation function of luminous galaxies @xcite .",
    "the most surprising aspect of our results is that the sph and sa models give such similar predictions for @xmath0 despite having very different galaxy mass functions .",
    "the different mass functions reflect the different treatments of cooling in the sa and sph calculations ( including the geometric idealizations in the former and the numerical resolution limitations in the latter ) , and the greater importance of stellar feedback in the sa calculation .",
    "the similarity of the predicted halo occupations implies that the hod is determined by physics that is robust to these cooling and feedback differences .",
    "obviously it is crucial that we select galaxy samples based on number density , using only the rank order of the baryonic masses rather than their absolute values ; for a fixed mass threshold , the numbers of galaxies would be different in the two calculations , and the hods could not possibly match .",
    "similarity of hods suggests that the rank order of galaxy masses and the rank order of stellar population ages are related in fairly simple ways to the merger histories of the dark matter halos , which should be statistically similar in the two methods .",
    "for example , the baryonic mass of a galaxy could be monotonically related ( by non - linear functions that are different in the two calculations ) to the mass of its parent halo at the last time this galaxy was `` central . ''",
    "the age could be determined ( at least in a rank - order sense ) by the formation time of this halo and the time at which its central object s star formation is suppressed by falling into a larger halo and becoming a satellite .",
    "mergers within halos also affect @xmath0 , but this process should be similar in the two calculations , since the assumptions about mergers in the sa model reproduce the results of numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "we can test this idea  that the form of the hod is driven largely by dark matter dynamics  by re - analyzing the sa galaxy population without using the predicted baryonic properties . for every sa galaxy ,",
    "we identify its parent halo at the last time this galaxy was central , and we denote the halo mass at that time by @xmath229 and the time itself by @xmath230 .",
    "we then create galaxy samples with the same space densities as before but use thresholds in @xmath229 rather than in baryonic mass .",
    "dotted curves in figures  [ fig : nn ] and  [ fig : nnn ] show the first and second moments of @xmath88 , respectively , for these samples defined by @xmath229 thresholds .",
    "it is interesting both that this simple mapping works as well as it does and that it does not work perfectly .",
    "the qualitative similarity of the mean occupations supports the idea that @xmath0 is largely governed by robust physics connected to halo merger histories .",
    "however , obvious differences , in particular the steeper slope of @xmath4 at the high mass end , indicate that additional physical processes must also play a significant role .",
    "it is encouraging that the sph and sa models agree with each other better than either model agrees with the `` rank by @xmath229 '' calculation .",
    "the fact that they predict fewer galaxies in high mass halos suggests that galaxy accretion rates begin to drop in overdense environments even before their parent halos fall into larger halos , allowing some of these galaxies to drop below the baryonic mass threshold and be replaced ( in a sample of fixed space density ) by galaxies forming in lower mass halos .",
    "recent studies provide observational support for this effect , showing decreased star formation rates in galaxies that are well outside the virial radii of rich clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we can map the stellar age of a galaxy onto the halo merger tree in a similar fashion .",
    "we make the simple assumption that the star formation in each galaxy starts at a time @xmath231 when its parent halo first exceeds a mass @xmath232 , a factor @xmath233 below the cutoff for @xmath38 .",
    "we assume that the star formation ends at a time @xmath234 when the galaxy becomes a satellite ( @xmath235 ) or when the cooling time in its parent halo becomes too long ( @xmath236 )  whichever happens first .",
    "we identify @xmath237 as the time when the parent halo mass exceeds @xmath98 .",
    "finally , we assume a constant star formation rate between @xmath231 and @xmath234 , making the mean stellar age of the galaxy @xmath238 .",
    "figure  [ fig : tstar ] compares the mean occupation functions for sa galaxies split into quartiles according to @xmath239 to those of quartiles defined by true stellar age ( repeated from figure  [ fig : nage ] ) .",
    "our highly simplified approximation yields the right qualitative dependence of @xmath4 on galaxy age , but it differs substantially in the quantitative details .",
    "the @xmath229 and @xmath239 models still make indirect use of the baryonic physics in the sa calculation , since baryonic masses affect which galaxies remain as distinct entities in larger halos and which are destroyed by dynamical friction .",
    "results from a more concerted effort to model the hod entirely with dark matter dynamics will be reported elsewhere ( berlind , bullock , kravtsov , wechsler , and zentner in preparation ) .",
    "finite resolution of the sph simulation has limited our comparison of predictions to relatively massive galaxies , and to age rather than morphology as a distinguishing characteristic of sub - classes .",
    "insensitivity of predictions to calculational details is likely to change when one gets to low mass galaxies or to characteristics that are determined by interactions with environment .",
    "for example , we might expect the hod of low mass galaxies to be quite different if their luminosity is controlled by photoionization or by supernova feedback .",
    "likewise , models that ascribe bulge - to - disk ratios mainly to merger histories , to secular evolution of disks , to weak perturbations in group / cluster environments , or to interaction with the igm could yield quite different predictions for the @xmath0 of different morphological types .",
    "the process of inferring halo occupations from observed galaxy clustering has already begun , and it should accelerate over the next few years with improved measurements from the 2dfgrs and the sdss . empirical hod determinations for galaxies with @xmath240 , classified by luminosity and color or spectral type , will test the basic predictions of the current scenario of galaxy formation , as presented here .",
    "they will also sharpen the constraints on cosmological models by removing bias as a degree of freedom in matching observed clustering .",
    "empirical determinations of hods for faint galaxies and for morphological subtypes should yield insight into the physics that governs the low end of the luminosity function and the origin of galaxy morphology .",

    "<S> the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) describes the bias between galaxies and dark matter by specifying ( a ) the probability @xmath0 that a halo of virial mass @xmath1 contains @xmath2 galaxies of a particular class and ( b ) the relative spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate and compare the hods predicted by a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulation of a @xmath3cdm cosmological model ( cold dark matter with a cosmological constant ) and by a semi - analytic galaxy formation model applied to the same cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> although the two methods predict different galaxy mass functions , their hod predictions for samples of the same space density agree remarkably well . in a sample defined by a baryonic mass threshold , </S>",
    "<S> the mean occupation function @xmath4 exhibits a sharp cutoff at low halo masses , a slowly rising plateau in which @xmath5 climbs from one to two over nearly a decade in halo mass , and a more steeply rising , high occupancy regime at high halo mass . in the low occupancy regime , the factorial moments @xmath6 and @xmath7 are well below the values @xmath8 and @xmath9 expected for poisson statistics , with important consequences for the small scale behavior of the 2- and 3-point correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> the hod depends strongly on galaxy age , with high mass halos populated mainly by old galaxies and low mass halos by young galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of galaxies within sph halos supports the assumptions usually made in semi - analytic calculations : the most massive galaxy lies close to the halo center and moves near the halo s mean velocity , while the remaining , satellite galaxies have the same radial profile and velocity dispersion as the dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the mean occupation at fixed halo mass in the sph simulation is independent of the halo s larger scale environment , supporting both the merger tree approach of the semi - analytic method and the claim that the hod provides a complete statistical characterization of galaxy bias . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the connections between the predicted hods and the galaxy formation physics incorporated in the sph and semi - analytic approaches . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions offer useful guidance to theoretical models of galaxy clustering , and they will be tested empirically by ongoing analyses of galaxy redshift surveys . by applying the hods to a large volume n - body simulation , </S>",
    "<S> we show that both methods predict slight departures from a power - law galaxy correlation function , similar to features detected in recent observational analyses . </S>"
