    "significant progress on this problem has been made over the last 25 years , since the early polarized deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments @xcite indicated that quarks carry only a small fraction of the proton s spin . in the intervening years a number of dedicated experimental programs have been undertaken at various accelerator facilities worldwide , refining our knowledge of the spin distributions through measurements of polarization asymmetries in inclusive and semi - inclusive lepton ",

    "independent of their physical interpretation , extraction of spin - dependent parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) is an important phenomenological pursuit , in which one seeks a consistent description of data from a variety of experiments within a perturbative qcd framework . with the growing body of experimental data",
    "being accumulated , and plans for future experiments at rhic , compass and jefferson lab to achieve greater precision and access to regions of kinematics hitherto unexplored , the need exists to develop the theoretical tools necessary to optimally utilize the new empirical information .",
    "systematic studies of spin - dependent pdfs have been performed by a number of collaborations , with next - to - leading order ( nlo ) analyses using the standard global fitting methodology undertaken by the dssv ( de  florian , sassot , stratmann and vogelsang ) @xcite , lss ( leader , sidorov and stamenov ) @xcite , bb ( blmlein and bttcher ) @xcite , and aac ( asymmetry analysis collaboration ) @xcite groups .",
    "all of these analyses utilize inclusive dis data on proton , deuteron and @xmath2he targets , while the lss10 @xcite and dssv09 @xcite pdfs are also constrained by semi - inclusive dis data .",

    "@xcite .    determining the nucleon spin fractions carried by quarks and gluons",
    "requires integrating the spin pdfs over all values of the momentum fraction @xmath0 .",
    "the small-@xmath0 region in particular contributes significantly to the integrals ( or lowest moments ) of the distributions , and considerable effort has been made to understand the spin pdfs in this region both experimentally and theoretically . on the other hand , at large values of @xmath0 the @xmath8 and @xmath9 quark pdfs are very sensitive to the dynamics underlying the breaking of su(2)@xmath10su(2 ) spin - flavor symmetry @xcite , as well as to the presence of quark orbital angular momentum in the nucleon @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , pdfs are notoriously difficult to extract at high values of @xmath0 due to the rapidly dropping cross sections in this region , and consequently spin structure measurements have received relatively little attention for @xmath11 .",
    "more recently , experiments at jefferson lab utilizing the high lumonisities and polarized beams available with the cebaf accelerator have collected high - precision data on polarization asymmetries and cross sections for both longitudinally and transversely polarized targets @xcite .",
    "the new data provide a unique , if somewhat limited , window on the high-@xmath0 region , which will be further extended following the 12  gev energy upgrade @xcite . in an effort to maximally exploit the new data , the jefferson lab angular momentum ( jam ) collaboration @xcite",
    "has embarked on a program to perform a global nlo analysis of world data , over a large range of kinematics , including a systematic study of spin - dependent pdfs in the high-@xmath0 and low-@xmath1 region .    from the kinematics of inclusive dis , at fixed four - momentum transfer squared @xmath1 , increasing values of @xmath0 are naturally correlated with decreasing invariant masses @xmath12 of the produced hadronic system , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mass of the nucleon . to ensure that the leading twist contribution dominates the scattering process",

    "this means that @xmath0 is bounded by @xmath16 , so that in practice at @xmath17  gev@xmath18 the dis region is limited to @xmath19 , and even at @xmath20  gev@xmath18 it is constrained to @xmath21 .",
    "since the experimentally explored @xmath1 range is more restricted in polarized dis than in unpolarized dis , a significantly larger portion of the spin - dependent data lie in the small-@xmath1 region .",
    "consequently , obtaining direct information on pdfs at large @xmath0 presents an even more difficult task than for spin - averaged pdfs , which themselves have sizeable uncertainties for @xmath22 @xcite . to compensate for the smaller overall number of data points available to global spin pdf analyses ,",
    "one is then typically forced to make use of data down to @xmath23  gev@xmath18 .",
    "the inclusion of data at large @xmath0 ( or low @xmath12 ) and low @xmath1 presents additional challenges for global pdf studies . to account for deviations in the low-@xmath1 data from the logarithmic @xmath1 dependence expected from perturbative qcd , corrections from various nonperturbative effects at finite @xmath1 , such as target mass and higher twist corrections ,",

    "we incorporate both twist-3 and twist-4 corrections to @xmath3 , as well as a twist-3 correction to the @xmath4 structure function .",
    "moreover , when using data obtained from experiments with polarized deuterium or @xmath2he nuclei , whose use is necessary for the separation of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 quark flavors , nuclear effects must be removed . while existing analyses typically do account for some nuclear effects through the method of effective polarizations , at large values of @xmath0 nuclear fermi motion plays an increasingly important role , requiring nuclear smearing corrections to be applied , as well as other possible corrections associated with nucleon off - shell and non - nucleonic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the nuclear corrections have been shown in recent unpolarized pdf analyses @xcite to be essential for correctly describing dis data at large @xmath0 and low @xmath12 , and are even more important in polarized fits , where low-@xmath12 dis data comprise a substantial fraction of the available data . in this work",
    "we consistently apply the nuclear smearing corrections to both the @xmath3 and @xmath4 structure functions for both deuterium and @xmath2he , within the framework of the weak binding approximation @xcite , and examine their impact on the extracted pdfs .    the strategy adopted in most previous global pdf studies has involved fitting the @xmath3 structure function or the polarization asymmetry @xmath24 , which are typically extracted from the experimental longitudinal polarization asymmetry using parametrizations of the unpolarized structure functions and assumptions about the transverse spin dependent @xmath4 structure function .",
    "in contrast , the jam analysis directly fits the measured longitudinal and transverse asymmetries , where available , thereby eliminating any potential biases introduced into the analysis by the use of inconsistent unpolarized structure function inputs obtained from separate experimental analyses .",
    "the unpolarized pdfs used in the jam analysis represent a new global fit to the world s spin - averaged data , performed along the lines of the spin - dependent fit and using a similar set of assumptions , kinematic cuts , and theoretical nuclear and finite-@xmath1 corrections ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    with the focus of this study being primarily on pdfs at intermediate and large @xmath0 , our strategy will be to first systematically explore the influence of the various corrections on the @xmath8 and @xmath9 quark distributions , whose determination in principle requires only inclusive dis data .",

    "however , it does reduce the uncertainty on the @xmath73 pdf by some 30% at @xmath104 compared with the main jam fit . even more strikingly , the e97 - 103 data places strong constraints on the higher twist part of @xmath105 , pinching the error band at @xmath101 , where the data are taken .",
    "it is in fact not possible to fit these data without inclusion of higher twist contributions ; doing so would lead to a 50% reduction in the @xmath73 distribution , in disagreement with other data .",
    "in contrast , the new data ( currently still being finalized ) from the eg1b experiment by the clas collaboration at jefferson lab @xcite contribute over 760 points for @xmath100 and @xmath9 over a large kinematic range , up to @xmath106  gev@xmath18 , albeit with larger errors than for the hall  a @xmath2he data .",
    "inclusion of these points leads to a small suppression of the @xmath72 distribution , which increases at higher @xmath0 , but a significant reduction in @xmath73 , by up to @xmath107 for @xmath0 between @xmath108 and 0.7 .",
    "concurrently , it also reduces the uncertainty on @xmath72 by @xmath109 in the large-@xmath0 region ( @xmath11 ) , and even more significantly for the @xmath73 , reducing it by @xmath110 at @xmath111 and @xmath92 at @xmath112 .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the potential impact of the clas data for reducing the overall pdf uncertainty at large @xmath0 values , and will be vital to incorporate in future pdf analyses , once the data analysis is finalized .",
    "we have presented the first results from the jam global nlo analysis of spin - dependent pdfs from available data on inclusive polarized dis from protons , deuterons and @xmath2he .",
    "where possible , we have fitted directly the measured polarization asymmetries , rather than relying on structure functions extracted under different conditions from the unpolarized cross sections .",
    "we include data from all polarized dis experiments that lie within the limits @xmath56  gev@xmath18 and @xmath57  gev@xmath18 , which allows us to constrain the @xmath72 and @xmath73 distributions up to @xmath95 .",
    "obtaining stable fits over this expanded kinematic range necessitates systematically accounting for target mass and higher twist corrections , which are vital for describing the @xmath3 and @xmath4 structure functions at the lower @xmath1 range , and nuclear smearing corrections for deuterium and @xmath2he nuclei , which have major impact at large  @xmath0 .    the results of the main jam fit indicate that the @xmath73 distribution has a significantly larger magnitude in the intermediate-@xmath0 region ( @xmath113 ) than in previous analyses , due primarily to the sizeable higher twist corrections found here . in particular",
    ", the twist @xmath114 term makes important contributions to both the @xmath3 and @xmath4 structure functions of the proton , and the @xmath115 correction makes a large and positive contribution to the neutron @xmath3 .",
    "the latter is mostly responsible for driving the @xmath73 distribution to become more negative .",
    "the induced twist-3 contribution to the proton @xmath3 also reduces the size of the twist-4 term compared to that found previously .",
    "the @xmath114 correction to the neutron @xmath4 is compatible with zero within errors .",
    "the general features of the twist-3 corrections appear to be weakly dependent on the choice of parametrization , except in the small-@xmath0 region , where some residual differences in their contributions to the @xmath4 structure function are found . in particular , parametrizations that do not enforce the burkhardt - cottingham sum rule yield negative ( positive ) enhancements at @xmath116 for the proton ( neutron ) , leading to small violations of the sum rule . on the other hand , differences in the behavior of the structure functions at small @xmath0 are suppressed for higher moments , such as the @xmath117 matrix element .",
    "our global analysis finds a positive contribution to the proton @xmath117 , of the order @xmath118 at a scale @xmath20  gev@xmath18 , while the neutron @xmath117 is consistent with zero .",
    "upcoming data from jefferson lab for @xmath2he @xcite will better constrain the neutron @xmath117 .",
    "independent of the details of the extracted higher twists , our analysis clearly highlights the importance of including subleading @xmath62 corrections in any analysis that attempts to fit data down to @xmath119  gev@xmath18 , even if more stringent cuts in @xmath5 are imposed .",
    "in contrast , relatively mild effects are found when varying the @xmath1 and @xmath5 cuts in the full jam analysis including finite-@xmath1 and nuclear smearing corrections .",
    "future data @xcite will also provide additional constraints on the behavior of the ratios @xmath120 of polarized to unpolarized pdfs in the @xmath121 limit",
    ". this will be important for testing perturbative qcd predictions for the @xmath121 behavior of pdfs , and for exploring the role of orbital angular momentum . while perturbative qcd arguments suggest that the polarized to unpolarized ratio should asymptote to unity at @xmath122 for all quark flavors , our fits for @xmath123 show no indication of a rise from its negative value over the currently measured region .    finally ,",
    "while the present inclusive dis data do not substantially constrain the polarized sea quark and gluon distributions at small @xmath0 , in the next phase of the jam analysis we shall integrate the lessons learned here into an expanded study including semi - inclusive dis data and hadron production asymmetries in polarized @xmath6 scattering , as well as the remaining high - precision data from the completed 6  gev experiments at jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "this will allow a more robust determination of the polarization of the nucleon sea , and provide a baseline fit which can fully exploit future data from jefferson lab at 12  gev , rhic , the eic and elsewhere .",
