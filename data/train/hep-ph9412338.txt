    "in this paper we have made a detailed study of the two - jet cross section in hadron - hadron collisions for a given range of jet transverse energy as a function of the pseudorapidities of the two jets .",
    "this distribution is particularly sensitive to the parton density functions at small ( @xmath6 ) to intermediate ( @xmath7 parton momentum fractions for jet transverse energies accessible to the cdf and d0 experiments at fermilab .",
    "for example , parton distributions that are relatively large at small @xmath5 ( and therefore constrained to be relatively small at larger @xmath5 by the momentum sum rule ) lead to a relative enhancement of the same - side two - jet cross section at large pseudorapidities ( @xmath8 ) and a relative depletion for central jets , @xmath9 .",
    "we have studied the next - to - leading qcd corrections to this distribution in some detail . to discuss the properties of the cross section",
    "it is convenient to divide the @xmath10 plane into two regions , the central region where the pseudorapidity of the two jets is less than the lowest order kinematic limit , @xmath11 and the foward region where the rapidity of one of the jets approaches or exceeds the lowest order boundary . in the central region ,    \\i ) the next - to - leading order corrections are small and perturbation theory works well .",
    "\\ii ) the scale uncertainty in the overall normalisation is reduced . varying @xmath12 by a factor of 2 about @xmath13 changes the next - to - leading order prediction by @xmath14 .",
    "\\iii ) the scale uncertainty in the shape of the distribution is quite small .",
    "for the same variation of @xmath12 , the relative bin - to - bin correction is less than @xmath15  see fig .",
    "10 .    on the other hand , in the forward region ,    \\i ) the next - to - leading order corrections are important and improve the agreement with experimental data .",
    "\\ii ) there is a considerable scale uncertainty because the corrections calculated in a ` next - to - leading ' order program corrections are effectively lowest order .    because the central pseudorapidity region is both sensitive to the parton densities and stable to higher order corrections , the triply differential distribution offers an excellent chance to gain extra information about the distribution of partons in the proton .",
    "the current and future runs of the tevatron at fermilab should yield copious quantities of two - jet events and once precise experimental data are available , it should be possible to make a determination of the gluon density at small and intermediate @xmath5 values . however , in addition to the uncertainty in the normalisation of the theoretical predictions , there is also an uncertainty in the experimental normalisation due to uncertainties in the luminosity measurement , in the jet energy calibration , and other effects .",
    "the information on the parton densities lies more in the _ shape _ than the overall normalisation , and one way of determining the parton densities is to allow the overall normalisation of the theoretical prediction , @xmath16 , to float , so that by varying @xmath17 the @xmath18 for @xmath19 summed over the different @xmath1 , @xmath2 cells in the central pseudorapidity region is minimised for a given parameterisation of the parton densities . by adjusting the input parameterisations ,",
    "the @xmath18 may be further reduced as the predicted shape becomes closer and closer to that observed in the data .",
    "of course , data can be taken for many slices in transverse energy .",
    "this allows the possibility of following the evolution of the parton densities directly by following trajectories of constant @xmath20 in the @xmath21 plane as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "at present only preliminary data are available for particular slices of the @xmath21 plane . the signed distribution ( sect .",
    "4 ) presented by the d0 collaboration is primarily sensitive to intermediate @xmath5 values . as we may expect from the preceding discussion , the shape is well predicted , but the normalisation is uncertain .",
    "nevertheless , the preliminary data appear to favour the parameterisations ( fig .",
    "on the other hand , the same - side to opposite - side cross section ratio presented by the cdf collaboration probes much smaller @xmath5 values .",
    "once again , the shape is relatively unchanged by including the next - to - leading order corrections . as shown in fig .  16",
    ", the preliminary data ( again with large errors ) appear to favour the more singular  parameterisation .",
    "of course , with the current experimental data sample , no definitive conclusion can be drawn . however , if these tentative observations are accurate , it would imply that the data favour the parton density with the largest density of gluons at _ both _",
    "@xmath22 _ and _ @xmath23 .",
    "in other words , there are more gluons present in the small and intermediate @xmath5 regions than expected from the momentum sum rule , which may in turn suggest that the density of gluons is not as well determined by direct photon data ( wa70 ) as previously thought .",
    "data from the current tevatron run should help to provide an answer to this puzzle .",
