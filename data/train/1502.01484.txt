    "engineering the transport properties of colloidal and nanoparticle additives in dispersions is of great fundamental interest and has practical implications in a wide range of technologies such as drug - delivery mechanisms , polymer nanocomposites ( pncs ) , material fabrication techniques , and separations .",
    "@xcite a useful feature of such dispersions is that their transport behavior can often be systematically varied via tuning the effective inter - species interactions , e.g. , external electric fields have been used to control the dynamics of conducting nanoparticles  @xcite , solvent ph has been tuned to manipulate the drug - release kinetics of nanocapsules  @xcite , etc .",
    "one approach to rationally tune transport properties is to utilize static - dynamic correlations , such as the empirical and quasi - universal positive correlation between excess entropy and long - time particle mobility ( e.g. , diffusivity ) for bulk fluids  @xcite and various inhomogeneous fluids  @xcite .",
    "another is through approximate theoretical approaches , like mode - coupling theory ( mct ) , which connect static structure and dynamic relaxation properties  @xcite .",
    "within such a framework , one can use statistical mechanical theories like fundamental measure theory ( fmt )  @xcite to connect interparticle interactions and structural correlations , the latter of which are then approximately related to the transport properties of the system . using these concepts , one can engineer interparticle interactions for targeted dynamic properties .",
    "in this vein , previous work using stochastic optimization and statistical mechanical theory found that the mobility of a single tracer particle in a dense fluid could be enhanced ( relative to a hard - sphere - like tracer ) by adopting a `` flattening '' tracer - solvent interaction , which interestingly also increased the effective tracer diameter  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the flattening interactions were designed to maximize the entropy associated with the tracer s static interparticle correlations , and hence disrupt the coordination shells of the surrounding solvent particles  @xcite .",
    "however , several interesting questions emerge from these findings that remain unresolved , including : why should a `` larger '' tracer exhibit faster dynamics ?",
    "how are the dynamics of the _ solvent _ particles influenced by tuning coordination structure ? and what happens to the solvent ( and tracer ) dynamics if multiple tracers are in close proximity , i.e. , the average tracer concentration is increased ?    in this paper , we take steps to address these questions by using a recently introduced steady - state `` color '' reaction - counterdiffusion particle labeling approach  @xcite to calculate position - dependent diffusivities of the solvent particles surrounding the tracer additive . this method allows us to isolate the affect of the modified tracer on the dynamic behavior of the surrounding fluid relative to the hard - sphere like tracer , and provides mechanistic insights into the underlying phenomenon of how disordering of the surrounding fluid affects the tracer - fluid system .",
    "furthermore , we explore the impact of tracer concentration on the local coordination - shell dynamics for the modified and hard - sphere - like tracer particle , by approximating the solvent - tracer system in a thin - film morphology , where the solvent particles are confined by two planar surfaces ( representing the tracer particle surface , fig .
