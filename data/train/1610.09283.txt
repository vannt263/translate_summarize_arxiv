    "in recent years , the central theme of cosmology has been the interesting fact that our universe is undergoing an accelerating expansion @xcite .",
    "this challenging current problem in cosmology represents a new imbalance in the governing friedmann equations .",
    "historically , physicists have addressed such imbalances by either introducing new sources , or by altering the governing equations .",
    "the standard model of cosmology addresses this imbalance by introducing a new source , named dark energy ( an `` exotic '' matter which has `` exotic '' properties such as an effective negative pressure ) in the friedmann equations .",
    "but the nature of dark energy is completely unknown to us and is an unresolved problem in modern cosmology @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "a group of physicists have explored the second route , i.e. , a modified gravity approach , on the assumption that at large scales , einstein s theory of general relativity breaks down and a more general action describes the gravitational field .",
    "such modified theories include f(r)-gravity , scalar tensor gravity , einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egb ) gravity , brane world gravity and many other @xcite .",
    "the egb gravity and the brane world scenario are such models related to gravity theory in higher dimension .",
    "in particular , the brane world mechanism , whereby matter is confined to the brane while gravity propagates in the bulk , means that extra dimensions can be much longer than in the conventional kaluza - klein mechanism , where matter and gravity both propagates in all dimensions . in randall and sundrum type ii ( rsii ) brane model @xcite ,",
    "our universe is a positive tension 3-brane embedded in a five dimensional ads bulk space - time .",
    "the standard model fields are confined on the brane while gravity can propagate in the bulk also .",
    "so the effective gravity on the brane is different from the standard einstein gravity due to the existence of extra dimension .",
    "another simple and well studied model of brane gravity is the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) brane world model @xcite .",
    "in contrast to rsii model , where the extra dimension is of finite size , in dgp brane world model our four dimensional world ( 3-brane ) is embedded in a space - time with an infinite size extra dimension , with the motivation of resolving the cosmological constant problems in super - symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "these modified theories @xcite are considered as gravitational alternatives for dark energy ( de ) and may serve as dark matter ( dm ) @xcite .",
    "+ thermodynamical viewpoint of modified gravity theory is an interesting issue in modern theoretical physics . from ads",
    "/ cft correspondence @xcite and black hole thermodynamics @xcite , it has been established that there is a deep connection between gravity and thermodynamics .",
    "hayward studied thermodynamics for a dynamical black hole @xcite and he introduced the notion of trapping horizon in 4d einstein gravity for non - stationary spherically symmetric space - times .",
    "subsequently , the idea of hayward was extended to universal thermodynamics by r. g. cai and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that einstein s equations are equivalent to the unified first law .",
    "however , they have shown @xcite that the above equivalence in different gravity theories ( namely in f(r ) and rsii brane ) is possible by introducing entropy production term .",
    "recently , a modified bekenstein entropy @xcite was obtained from the validity of the unified first law in different gravity theories by projecting it along any tangential direction to the horizon .",
    "the interesting feature of this modified entropy is that the leading order term is the usual bekenstein entropy and it reduces to bekenstein entropy in einstein gravity . in the present work",
    ", we shall use this modified entropy of the horizon in different gravity theories namely f(r ) gravity , einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity , rsii brane scenario and dgp brane world and examine the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics ( gslt ) and thermodynamical equilibrium ( te ) for universe bounded by apparent / event horizon .",
    "in all the gravity theories the matter in the universe is chosen as interacting holographic dark energy ( hde ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii deals with basic equations for universal thermodynamics while in section iii , thermodynamical study in different gravity theories are analyzed .",
    "finally , a brief discussion about the results obtained are presented in section iv .",
    "in recent years universal thermodynamics has been studied extensively , mostly with an apparent horizon . however",
    ", a comparative study of event and apparent horizon from the point of view of the validity of thermodynamical laws has been done by wang et al .",
    "using dark energy fluids , they claimed that universe bounded by an apparent horizon is a bekenstein system while event horizon is nonphysical in the context of thermodynamics .",
    "subsequently , it has been shown @xcite that assuming first law of thermodynamics , it is possible to have generalized second law of thermodynamics(gslt ) ( in any gravity theory ) on the event horizon with some realistic conditions .",
    "recently , a correct form of hawking temperature has been proposed @xcite and as a result , it is possible to obtain the validity of both the thermodynamical laws for any fluid .    in the context of isolated macroscopic systems ,",
    "the entropy should never decrease , because such a system always evolves towards thermodynamic equilibrium , a state having maximum entropy .",
    "thus for a matter filled universe , bounded by a horizon , the generalized second law of thermodynamics and thermodynamical equilibrium are expressed by the following inequalities @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the entropies of the horizon and that of the fluid within it respectively .",
    "usually , clausius relation @xmath3 and gibb s relation @xcite @xmath4 are used to obtain the entropy variation of the horizon and that of the fluid respectively . in the above ( @xmath5 )",
    "stand for the temperature of the horizon and fluid respectively ( usually they are chosen identical ) , @xmath6 , @xmath7 denote respectively the energy flow across the horizon and the total energy of the fluid and @xmath8 is the volume of the fluid bounded by the horizon .",
    "moreover , in analogy to a dynamical black hole ( bh ) @xcite , the concept of trapping horizon has been introduced in 4d einstein gravity for non - stationary spherically symmetric space - times and einstein equations have been shown to be equivalent to the unified first law ( ufl ) . then , projecting ufl along the tangential ( @xmath9 ) to the trapping horizon @xcite , one can recover the first law of thermodynamics and the clausius relation takes the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the surface gravity ( discussed later ) of the horizon , a is the surface area of the horizon and @xmath12 is the usual energy supply vector .",
    "further , in the context of universal thermodynamics , our universe should be a non - stationary gravitational system while from the cosmological view point it should be homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "so the natural choice is the flrw universe- a dynamical spherically symmetric space - time , having only inner trapping horizon ( the apparent horizon ) . in 2005 ,",
    "cai and kim @xcite initiated such studies with hawking temperature ( @xmath13 ) and bekenstein entropy ( @xmath14 ) on the apparent horizon as @xmath15 with @xmath16 as the radius of the apparent horizon .",
    "they showed the equivalence between ( modified ) einstein equations and ufl not only in einstein gravity but also in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity and lovelock gravity .",
    "subsequently , cai and others @xcite examined the ufl in other modified gravity theories namely , scalar tensor theory @xcite and brane world scenario @xcite .",
    "however , one must add entropy production term @xcite to have the clausius relation in f(r)-gravity theory",
    ". then f(r)-gravity ( generalized f(r ) ) has been studied with a modified version of the horizon entropy .",
    "recently , we have modified the horizon entropy @xcite suitably so that clausius relation is automatically satisfied . in this context , the present work is an extension in different gravity theories .",
    "the line element for homogeneous and isotropic flrw model is given by @xmath17 where k=0 , @xmath18 is the curvature scalar , @xmath19 is the area radius and @xmath20 is the metric on 2-space ( @xmath21 ) . using double null co - ordinates @xmath22 the above line element takes the form @xcite : @xmath23 with @xmath24 as the future pointing null vectors .    according to hayward",
    ", the trapping horizon ( @xmath25 ) is defined as , @xmath26 i.e. , @xmath27 the surface gravity is defined as @xmath28 which for the above model has the explicit form @xmath29 with @xmath30 .    usually in modified gravity theories ,",
    "the modified friedmann equations are written as @xmath31 and @xmath32 the above equations are nothing but friedmann equations for non interacting two fluid system- one is the usual fluid of energy density @xmath33 and thermodynamic pressure @xmath34 , while the second one is termed as effective quantities due to curvature ( or other ) contributions and we have @xmath35 usually , the energy supply vector @xmath12 and the work density w are defined as @xcite @xmath36 so in the present context , the explicit form of w and @xmath12 are @xmath37 and @xmath38 note that the heat flow @xmath39 in the clausius relation can be obtained only from the pure matter energy supply @xmath40 by projecting on the horizon .",
    "also the ( 0 , 0)- component of the modified einstein equations ( equation ( [ 12 ] ) ) is equivalent to the ufl @xcite , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the volume bounded by the horizon .",
    "now for the apparent horizon , the tangent vector @xmath9 can be decomposed in terms of null vectors as @xmath43 where the ratio of the coefficients can be obtained from the fact that @xmath44 , @xmath45 as for the present model @xmath46 so in ( t , r)-coordinate , @xmath9 can have the explicit form @xmath47 thus projecting the ufl along @xmath9 , the first law of thermodynamics takes the form @xcite , @xmath48 and consequently , @xmath49 or in the explicit form @xmath50 further , using hawking temperature on the apparent horizon as @xmath51 and using the clausius relation : @xmath52 , the entropy on the apparent horizon can be taken to be @xmath53 i.e. , @xmath54 which shows that the entropy on the apparent horizon differs from the usual bekenstein entropy by a correction term ( in integral form ) .    on the other hand , for the event horizon ,",
    "as @xmath55 is the one form orthogonal to the surface of the event horizon , so the tangent vector @xmath9 can be taken as @xcite @xmath56 and consequently the modified entropy on the event horizon has the explicit form @xmath57 which also has the bekenstein entropy as the leading term .    before ending this section ,",
    "it is worthy to mention that in the cosmological context , one can consider the following entropy bounds : + ( i ) the bekenstein bound , + ( ii ) the holographic bekenstein - hawking bound @xcite + and ( iii ) cardy - verlinde ( c - v ) bound @xcite .",
    "+ the bekenstein bound is supposed to hold for systems with limited self - gravity .",
    "in cosmological perspective , this implies that the hubble radius ( @xmath58 ) is larger than the radius ( r ) of the universe . on the other hand , in a strongly self - gravitating universe ( i.e. , hr @xmath59 1 )",
    ", one has to take into account the possibility of bh formation . thus using the general philosophy of the holographic principle",
    ", one gets @xmath14 ( bekenstein entropy ) @xmath60 for weak self - gravity while @xmath61 for strong self - gravity , where @xmath62 , is the holographic bekenstein - hawking entropy of a black hole of same size as the universe ( n+1 is the dimension of the space - time ) .",
    "one may note that @xmath63 grows like an area instead of the volume and for a closed universe , it is the closest one to the usual expression @xmath64 .",
    "the limiting situation i.e , @xmath65 when @xmath66 is termed as hubble bound . finally , the c - v bound is valid through out the cosmological evolution and is associated with the casimir energy .",
    "also it has been showed that @xcite friedmann equation in radiation dominated frw universe can be written in an analogous form of c - v formula , an entropy formula for a conformal field theory .",
    "in this section we shall examine the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics and the thermodynamical equilibrium for the following modified gravity theories : + i ) f(r)-gravity , + ii ) einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity , + iii)rsii brane scenario + and iv ) dgp brane world .",
    "let us consider our universe to be homogeneous and isotropic flat frw model and the line element is given by ( for simplicity @xmath67 )    @xmath68 $ ] .    where @xmath69 is the scale factor of the universe and @xmath70 is the metric on the unit 2-space .",
    "+ regarding matter distribution , we assume that universe is filled with holographic dark energy ( hde ) interacting with dark matter ( dm ) in the form of dust .",
    "the argument behind choice of interaction models is that they are favoured by observed data obtained from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and matter distribution at large scales @xcite .",
    "further , das et al .",
    "@xcite and amendola et al .",
    "@xcite showed that an interaction ( between hde and dm in the dust form ) model of the universe mimics the observationally measured phantom equation of state as compared to noninteracting models , which may predict a non - phantom type of equation of state .",

    "in the present work , we have examined the validity of gslt and te for frw universe bounded by apparent / event horizon for different gravity theories .",
    "an ideal thermodynamical system should obey the generalized second law of thermodynamics and it should be in thermal equilibrium . from the point of view of present accelerating phase we have chosen hde ( with event horizon as ir cut off ) interacting with dm as the matter contained in the universe . although we are considering purely classical ideal fluid , but from the point of view of thermal equilibrium with the horizon , we need a quantum description .",
    "this is possible if we consider the fluid under consideration as an effective kind of description of a real scalar field @xmath144 having self interacting potential @xmath138 . as the time variations of the total entropy ( for both the horizons )",
    "is complicated so we can not make any conclusion from the restrictions ( presented in tabular form ) for the validity of gslt and te . as a result , using recent planck data sets for estimation of parameters in hde , we have presented the total entropy variations graphically .    from the figures 1(a)-(d )",
    "we see that gslt does not hold for any data set on both the horizons in f(r)-gravity with @xmath230 .",
    "the thermodynamical equilibrium ( te ) does not hold for the first two data sets ( except for a small neighbourhood of @xmath231 ) for both the horizons , but we have some peculiar situation for the 3rd data set . here",
    "te at the apparent horizon holds for all @xmath73 while at the event horizon te holds for @xmath232 . as in a thermodynamical system gslt",
    "does not holds but te holds , which is not a realistic situation , so we may say that the third data set is not appropriate in the present case and for the first two data sets universe as a thermodynamical system is not an ideal one in f(r)-gravity model .    in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity , for the third data set",
    ", the thermodynamical system has a similar ( as above in f(r)-gravity ) contradictory behaviour and hence we discard this data set for the present egb gravity theory . on the other hand , universal thermodynamics for universe bounded by apparent / event horizon in egb gravity theory",
    "is an ideal thermodynamical system provided the coupling parameter @xmath73 is restricted to ( see figures 2(a)-(d ) ) @xmath233 for both the horizons .    from figures 3(a)-(d ) , we observe that in rsii brane scenario , the situation is not so worse for the third data set - gslt holds at both the horizons for all values of @xmath73 but not the thermodynamical equilibrium . on the other hand , for the first two data sets gslt holds for @xmath234 at both the horizons but there is no longer any thermal equilibrium ( except for a small range of @xmath73 around @xmath235 at the event horizon ) .",
    "so universe bounded by any of the two horizons in rs - ii brane model is not an ideal thermodynamical system for all the three data sets .",
    "lastly , in dgp brane model we see from figures 4(a)-(d ) that both gslt and te hold at both the horizons and for all the data sets provided @xmath73 is restricted to @xmath236 .",
    "hence universal thermodynamics in dgp brane model for universe bounded by apparent/ event horizon is a possible ideal thermodynamical system ( with @xmath236 ) .",
    "further , it should be mentioned that similar analysis is possible for scalar tensor theory of gravity .",
    "but due to very complicated expressions for the time derivatives of the total entropy , it is not possible to conclude any thing either graphically or from tabular representation .",
    "hence we have not presented it here .    in the present work",
    "the modified gravity theories are represented ( as usually done ) in the form of generalized fluid with inhomogeneous equation of state .",
    "usually , this type of theories may pretend to unify the early - time inflation with the theory describing the late - time acceleration .",
    "also , it has been shown that phantom scalar field models can be mapped into a mathematically equivalent , modified f(r ) gravity .",
    "further , modified gravity becomes complex at the region where the original phantom dark energy theory develops a big rip singularity .",
    "thus the thermodynamical analysis may be questionable in the regime near to one of the four types of future singularities ( as classified in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this context",
    ", it should be noted that in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that except for some special cases of type ii and type iv singularities , the dynamical entropy bound is violated near the singularity .",
    "hence , for future work in the context of gslt and te , it will be interesting to study the validity of them and the dynamical entropy bound near the future singularities .",
    "also it will be interesting to examine the dynamical entropy bound of the modified entropies derived in the present work for both apparent and event horizons .",
    "therefore , from the above discussion we conclude that similar to einstein gravity @xcite ( where event horizon is more favourable than apparent horizon ) we have no definite conclusion whether apparent or event horizon is more favourable from thermodynamic view point in different gravity theories i.e. , both the horizons are equally favoured or disfavoured from thermodynamic view point in different gravity theories .",
