    "<S> in this work we study the dynamical generation of mass in the massless @xmath0 wess - zumino model in a three dimensional spacetime . using the tadpole method to compute the effective potential , we observe that supersymmetry is dynamicaly broken together with the discrete symmetry @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this model , differently from non - supersymmetric scalar models , exhibits a consistent perturbative dynamical generation of mass after two loop corrections to the effective potential .    </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most beautiful theoretical accomplishments of the present time . </S>",
    "<S> however , to construct realistic models of particle physics , susy should be spontaneously broken  @xcite at some energy scale , since we do not observe the superpartners of the ordinary particles ( e.g. seletrons , squarks , etc ... ) . due to the non - renormalization theorem , </S>",
    "<S> however , spontaneous breaking of susy is ruled out for a wide class of models  @xcite . theoretically , it is essential to understand under which conditions susy can be broken , while it is the experimental data that will eventually tell us how susy is broken .    </S>",
    "<S> toy models constructed in three dimensional spacetime have been intensely explored in the literature as a good theoretical laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> as indicated by witten  @xcite , differently from models defined in four dimensional spacetime , dynamical susy breaking can occur in @xmath2 spacetime , and this possibility was studied for the wess - zumino model and massless electrodynamics at one loop order , showing that no breaking appears  @xcite , i.e. , up to one loop order neither susy nor gauge symmetry are dynamically broken . </S>",
    "<S> however , an investigation of higher loop order is still necessary to verify whether dynamical susy breaking really happens in such models .    on the other hand , dynamical generation of mass in a non - supersymmetric purely scalar model </S>",
    "<S> is inconsistent with perturbation theory  @xcite . in this work </S>",

    "<S> it is obvious from eq.([eq3bb ] ) that radiative corrections does not change this result , because in @xmath11 models radiative quantum corrections are bilinear in the auxiliary fields  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the minimum of the classical potential is still the minimum of the quantum effective potential , so that in @xmath11 spacetime supersymmetry can not be broken by quantum corrections .    in three dimensional spacetime </S>",
