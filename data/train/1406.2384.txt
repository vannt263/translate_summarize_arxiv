    "fluctuations in @xmath51 move r@xmath46 outside r@xmath53 , which allows the radio pulsar to turn on .",
    "this triggers a transition to the disk - passive state , where the lower l@xmath0 is produced by a shock between the pulsar wind and the innermost accretion flow . a slight increase in @xmath51",
    "would then push the inner edge of the disk back inside the light cylinder and turn off the radio pulsar mechanism .",
    "thus in this simple qualitative model , supported by the inferred r@xmath46 in m28-i ( fig .",
    "[ fig : disk ] ) , the x - ray mode switches reflect a dynamic balance between the accretion flow and the pulsar wind .",
    "let us now review this tug - of - war scenario in light of our new results on the disk state of j1023 and j12270 .",
    "the light cylinder in j1023 and j12270 is a factor 2.3 smaller , due to their 2.3 times shorter p@xmath33 .",
    "given the weak scaling of r@xmath46 with @xmath51 ( r@xmath55 ) , l@xmath0 should increase by a factor of almost 20 to compensate for the factor 2.3 faster spin and bring r@xmath46 back inside the light cylinder .",
    "however , the l@xmath0 of j1023 , j12270 ( for d=1.4  kpc ) and m28-i in the active / passive states are consistent within a factor @xmath261.7 ( table  [ table : redbacks ] ) .",
    "therefore , we find that there is no strong dependence of the disk state luminosity ( and the inferred r@xmath45 ) on the pulsar s spin or orbital period ( p@xmath7 in j1023 is also about 2.3 times shorter than m28-i ) .",
    "this argues against the tug - of - war model in its simplest form : as shown in figure  [ fig : disk ] , r@xmath46 does not cross the light cylinder in the case of j1023 and j12270 when going from the disk - active to the disk - passive state .",
    "the r@xmath46 shown in figure  [ fig : disk ] suggest that j1023 and j12270 ( with r@xmath46@xmath5r@xmath53 ) may also harbor a rotation - powered pulsar in the disk state ( both active and passive ) . however , we stress that a more detailed physical model of the transition between accretion and rotation power is needed to confirm this , one that goes beyond the magnetospheric radius prescription .",
    "extensive radio observations of the disk - passive state can help understand its nature , assessing whether or not the rotation - powered pulsar is on .",
    "forces other than magnetic , such as radiation pressure from the radio pulsar , are expected to act upon the inner accretion disk .",
    "@xcite studied the truncation and stability of accretion disks around radio pulsars .",
    "they found that the radiation pressure of a rotation - powered pulsar does not necessarily disrupt a surrounding disk , and therefore an accretion disk and an active mrp can coexist . according to their model ,",
    "stable disk solutions exist with r@xmath45@xmath5r@xmath53 , up to more than ten times r@xmath53 if the neutron star s magnetic inclination ( angle between spin and magnetic axes ) is small @xcite . in this context , we note that our highest estimate of the magnetospheric radius in the disk - active state , r@xmath46@xmath8147  km  @xmath81.8@xmath1r@xmath53 in j1023 , only has stable solutions for magnetic inclinations lower than 15@xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this might indicate that redbacks have nearly aligned rotating dipoles , although more detailed models tailored to the disk state of redback mrps are required to make quantitative statements . in any case , our results strongly support the presence of a stable accretion disk around redback millisecond pulsars with r@xmath45@xmath5r@xmath53 .",
    "hence this new class of pulsars holds great potential to study accretion flows near the light cylinder .",
    "we measure an x - ray flux of 0.6  mcrab in the brightest disk - active state in our sample ( j12270 ) , i.e. , more than ten times fainter than the 1-day sensitivity limits of currently active all - sky x - ray monitors ( _ maxi _ : 8  mcrab at 5@xmath56 , @xcite ; _ swift_-bat : 16  mcrab at 3@xmath56 , @xcite ) .",
    "longer exposures @xcite or improved all - sky monitors , such as the wide - field monitor onboard the proposed _",
    "loft _ mission , may be able to detect new transitions of redbacks to the disk state . until then , _",
    "swift_-xrt monitoring provides the most efficient way of catching state transitions in nearby redback millisecond pulsars .",
    "an interesting question for future study is when exactly ( at which l@xmath0 ) accretion - powered x - ray pulsations appear , and whether or not this coincides with the complete disappearance of rotation - powered radio pulsations .",
    "@xcite set an upper limit of 17% on the pulsed fraction of m28-i at l@xmath0@xmath1210@xmath4  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "the redbacks compiled in this work offer the best prospects in this respect , and given their short d and low n@xmath16 they should allow a much more sensitive search for x - ray pulsations at low l@xmath0 . for instance , the collected x - ray count rates in the disk - active state of j12270 ( 4.8 and 6.4  c  s@xmath3 with _",
    "xmm _ and the approved _ nicer _ mission , respectively ) are 25 times higher than those for m28-i at the same l@xmath0 .",
    "by studying the full sample of redbacks selected for this work , we find that the x - ray luminosity of the pulsar state is in the 10@xmath1310@xmath2  erg  s@xmath3 range , always lower than that of the disk state ( fig .  [",

    "more intense ablation of the companion s heated face could result into enhanced mass transfer , and potentially feed accretion disk episodes such as those seen in j1023 and j12270 .",

    "measurements of the radio pulsar spin - down rate may be possible soon for more redbacks , and together with the luminosities reported herein will help constrain the energetics of the pulsar wind shock .",
