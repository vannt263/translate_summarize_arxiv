    ". they can escape dense environments and travel through cosmic distances , allowing for a direct view of emission sites hidden from high - energy electromagnetic observations .",
    "icecube has recently detected high - energy neutrinos of astrophysical origin , with a detection rate of @xmath4yr@xmath5 for neutrino energies @xmath6tev @xcite . nevertheless , the cosmic source population producing this neutrino flux is currently unknown .",
    "a planned upgrade of icecube , icecube - gen2 @xcite , is expected to improve neutrino detection rate by a factor of @xmath7 , greatly increasing the prospects of identifying the origin and emission mechanism of high - energy neutrinos .",
    "another proposed neutrino detector in the mediterranean , km3net @xcite , will be comparably sensitive , and will be sensitive in directions complementary to icecube .",
    "there are multiple search strategies being considered that aim to determine the origin of the cosmic neutrinos .",
    "a.   _ neutrino - only _ : spatial or temporal clustering of neutrinos alone could be used to identify energetic nearby sources , even without any further information on potential source candidates @xcite .",
    "no such clustering has been detected so far .",
    "this was used to constrain rare , bright source populations @xcite .",
    "while these analyses are essentially model - independent , they are less sensitive than those that utilize additional multimessenger information . b.   _ spectral information _ from the detected neutrinos in comparison with other observed astrophysical fluxes , such as cosmic rays @xcite or gev gamma rays @xcite , can help determine the source of origin .",
    "neutrino spectral features may also be indicative of the source s environment @xcite .",
    "it is , nevertheless , difficult to arrive at definite conclusions solely by such comparisons . c.   _ multimessenger searches _ : neutrinos can be associated with a source population observed through other messengers @xcite .",
    "this strategy has the advantage of integrating additional information in the search .",
    "ultimately , identifying the neutrino s origin will likely require such an association .",
    "so far , most of the searches using astrophysical source catalogs , e.g. , using gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; @xcite ) and gravitational wave candidates @xcite , focused on relatively rare sources with limited neutrino background @xcite , or a limited subset of more common source types @xcite . no correlation has been identified in these searches .",
    "the neutrino directional distribution also seems to indicate that the bulk of the detected neutrinos originates outside of the milky way .",
    "recently , ahlers & halzen @xcite considered the general case of using the locations of the brightest sources to enhance search sensitivity to neutrino multiplets , making an important first step and characterizing the expected sensitivity .",
    "their results indicate that , in contrast to the case of transient sources , the identification of multiplets from a population of continuous sources will be challenging , even with an extended observation period with icecube - gen2 , except for rare source types .",
    "search strategies are relatively straightforward for transient sources for which the limited duration efficiently reduces the background .",
    "similarly , for rare , bright sources , looking at the nearest , brightest sources can already be informative @xcite .",
    "however , for weaker , continuous sources , the utilization of source catalogs is not straightforward since the majority of the detected neutrinos were emitted at distances at which the source population is homogeneous on the scale of the neutrino directional uncertainty .",
    "this means that distant sources do not help with the association . on the other hand",
    ", it is advantageous to use more than just the closest sources in correlation with the detected neutrinos , since ( i ) the closest ( non - galactic ) sources likely emit only a negligible fraction of the total neutrino flux , and ( ii ) source distributions are sufficiently anisotropic out to distances containing a large number of sources , even for continuous source models with relatively high source densities .",
    "this paper explores the prospects of using catalogs of astrophysical sources to search for the origin of high - energy neutrinos .",
    "our goal is to devise and evaluate a search strategy that efficiently utilizes source catalogs .",
    "we derive the prospects of using such a search strategy for a number of possible source models , namely starburst galaxies , the cores of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and blazars .",
    "in particular we determine the angular precision of neutrino detectors that would allow for the identification of different source types .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the search strategy in section [ section : searchstrategy ] .",
    "we then discuss our results on search sensitivity in section [ section : results ] .",
    "in particular we use monte carlo simulations to explore the role of the detector angular precision and the catalog distance range .",
    "we summarize the results and present our conclusions in section [ section : conclusion ] .",
    "our goal is to take advantage of the anisotropic distribution of astrophysical sources , and correlate the sources directional variation with the directions of the detected neutrinos .",
    "it is clear that at large enough distances , the source population is quasi - homogeneous , rendering the position of these distant sources uninformative .",
    "we can therefore constrain the search to sources within a threshold distance @xmath8 ( or threshold redshift @xmath9 ) .    constraining the search to neutrinos",
    "emitted from known sources within @xmath8 means , in effect , that neutrinos originating in these known sources will be the _ signal _ neutrinos , while _ background _",
    "neutrinos will be those ( i ) originating in the atmosphere , ( ii ) from sources beyond @xmath8 , and ( iii ) from un - cataloged sources within @xmath8 .",

    "we will further assume that all cosmic neutrinos originate from the same source type .",
    "for the three considered sources , we follow @xcite and adopt local number densities @xmath40mpc@xmath41 , the range @xmath42mpc@xmath41 , and @xmath43mpc@xmath41 for starburst galaxies , agns and blazars , respectively .    for simplicity , we assume that @xmath44 is identical for all sources within a given source type .",
    "this is a conservative assumption ; taking into account the variation in luminosity would increase anisotropy , and therefore make the search more sensitive .",
    "we expect that typical source catalogs will have limited information on source strength .",
    "nevertheless , if such information is available , it is straightforward to incorporate it in the analysis by simply using the derived luminosity values , which in turn will further improve our sensitivity .      to find the number of detected astrophysical neutrinos , we need to estimate the fraction of the neutrino flux at earth that originates from the cataloged sources",

    "we randomly select corresponding @xmath90 values drawn from the probability densities of @xmath89 as described above .",

    "in other words , we characterize the sensitivity by the probability @xmath100 of obtaining a result from a signal+background model with p - value @xmath101 .",
    "the optimal threshold distance for a search depends on the level of anisotropy determined by the source number density , as well as the completeness of the catalog as a function of distance . to characterize the optimal threshold distance for source catalogs , we calculate the sensitivity of the catalog - based search as a function of catalog threshold distance .",

    "this saturation is beyond the 1gpc shown here for the most accurate localization with @xmath103 uncertainty considered here .",
    "this saturation is expected ; at larger distances , the average angular source density is @xmath104 , making directional density fluctuations small .",
    "this means that sources at large distances will not significantly contribute to sensitivity .",
    "an important consequence of this result is that even a catalog out to @xmath105mpc@xmath106 can be close to optimal unless angular uncertainty is small ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "this is important since source catalog completeness can be significantly reduced for larger distances . nevertheless , for high directional accuracy",
    ", catalogs out to @xmath108mpc may help . while catalogs are currently far from complete at 200mpc , we point out that , for a relatively small number of neutrinos , one can construct such a catalog specifically for the direction of the neutrinos ( see @xcite for a similar analysis ) .",
    "this significantly reduces the required observation time , making such a neutrino - specific catalog possible .",
    "these results indicate that ( i ) considering a large number of sources out to a distance of @xmath109mpc is advantageous over using only the closest few sources in establishing the origin of the neutrinos , and that ( ii ) for typical localization uncertainties , considering sources out to a threshold distance of @xmath109mpc is reasonable .",
    "one of the critical questions we aim to address here is how accurate neutrino angular reconstruction needs to be to ensure that a catalog - based search can identify the source population of cosmic neutrinos .",
    "we ran monte carlo simulations ( section [ section : mc ] ) to determine @xmath100 as a function of @xmath83 for different source types , using @xmath102yr with icecube - gen2 , with @xmath110 , and a threshold distance @xmath111mpc for starbursts , agns and blazars .",

    "high - energy neutrino observatories can detect neutrinos over a uniquely wide energy range . in the case of icecube - gen2 , including extensions such as pingu , neutrinos will be detectable from @xmath4gev to @xmath115pev .",

    ", we examine _ low - threshold _ ( @xmath78tev ) neutrino searches that cover most of the sensitive energy band of the detector , with characteristic @xmath116tev neutrino energies .",
    "we discuss the sensitivity of these searches in comparison to searches over the highest energy ( @xmath117tev ) neutrinos that we discussed previously ( see section [ section : detectionrate ] ) .",
    "focusing on the highest energies has the advantage of high signal - to - noise ratio , given the very low background , and the somewhat better direction reconstruction than at lower energies .",
    "it yields , however , a relatively small overall number of signal neutrinos .",
    "low - threshold searches benefit from having significantly larger number of signal neutrinos , but they need to overcome significant background contamination , given the soft atmospheric background spectrum .",
    "we repeat the monte carlo simulations used above for the case of the highest - energy neutrinos ( section [ sec : angular ] ) , but now for the low - threshold case , to obtain the probability of identifying a source type as the origin of the astrophysical high - energy neutrinos .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : neutrinogalaxy_low - threshold ] .",
    "there are several points regarding the comparison of the low and high - threshold cases .",
    "( 1 ) for larger angular uncertainty , the high - threshold sample performs better , while improving angular resolution results in the low - threshold case becoming more sensitive .",
    "this is intuitively expected .",
    "once angular resolution is small enough with respect to the number of background overlaps ( which depends on both the resolution and the source density ) , having more events helps and improves the sensitivity beyond the small sample available for the high - threshold case .",
    "( 2 ) if neutrino energy probability distribution was used in the analysis  as they are in , e.g. , standard icecube point - source analyses @xcite , then a search could combine the benefits of both low and high - threshold analyses , since the contributions of the two cases would be distinguished , i.e. the result would always be at least as good as the result in either figs . [",
    "figure : neutrinogalaxy ] and [ figure : neutrinogalaxy_low - threshold ] .",
    "we see that the probability of source type identification is comparable to that of the case of the highest - energy neutrinos , but is somewhat below it , especially for larger angular uncertainty .",
    "this result , of course , is strongly dependent on the assumed source spectrum .",
    "softer source spectra , with fixed neutrino flux at the highest - energy range where astrophysical neutrinos have been detected , could strongly enhance the utility of @xmath116tev neutrinos .      beyond angular uncertainty ,",
    "another variable of interest is the size of the detector , which largely determines sensitivity . to examine the role of detector size , we use monte carlo simulations to calculate the probability to identify a source type for different neutrino configurations .",
    "in particular , we characterize detector size by changing the detection rate of astrophysical and atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "we use an identical change for the two neutrino populations .",
    "the role of detection rate is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : neutrinogalaxy_size ] , for a fixed angular uncertainty of @xmath2 .",

    "is essentially proportional to the detection rate , signifying a rapid change .      while detector size may similarly affect the number of detected astrophysical and atmospheric neutrinos , it is also possible to improve capabilities to identify and filter out a fraction of atmospheric neutrinos , for example via surface arrays . here",
    ", we examine the utility of such vetoes by considering the change in the probability to identify the neutrino s source of origin as a function of the atmospheric neutrino rate .",
    "we take the case of icecube - gen2 in sunflower 240 configuration for the highest energies with @xmath117tev neutrinos , keep the detection rate of astrophysical neutrinos fixed , and vary the detection rate of atmospheric neutrinos .",

    "in section [ section : fraction ] we discussed the possibility of starburst galaxies having a steeper cosmic evolution than star formation rate , which would suppress the fraction of local neutrino emission .",
    "while the results presented so far used starburst evolution following the star formation rate , here we comment on how the results would be different for such a faster evolution .    for a factor of @xmath7 reduction in the local contribution of starburst galaxies ,",
    "the consequence is an effective 10-fold reduction in the number of astrophysical neutrinos from nearby sources , while the total number of detected neutrinos remains unchanged ",
    "neutrinos from more distant sources will be considered background for the purposes of source - catalog - based searches . following the analytical estimate of bartos",
    "@xcite , this should correspond to a factor of @xmath119 decrease in detection probability compared to the unsuppressed case .",
    "we carried out the monte - carlo analysis for the highest energy neutrinos as presented in section [ section : mc ] , with @xmath71 instead of @xmath120 .",

    "we examined the prospects of utilizing the anisotropy of possible neutrino - sources to probe the origin of the cosmic high - energy neutrinos .",
    "we considered the use of catalogs of starburst galaxies , agns and blazars , and explored the role of the angular uncertainty of the detector , as well as the distance reach of a source catalog , in identifying the source of the neutrinos .",
    "since we focused on continuous sources , we relied on neutrino track events with significantly better angular resolution than cascade events .",
    "we presented a search method that can efficiently incorporate the directional and distance information of sources in a catalog - based search that does not rely on neutrino - neutrino coincidence .",
    "we were particularly interested in starburst galaxies and agns since their number density is high enough that they are considered difficult to resolve with neutrinos @xcite .",
    "we looked at next generation neutrino detectors such as icecube - gen2 with significantly increased sensitivity and angular resolution compared to current detectors .",
    "our main findings are as follows :    1 .",
    "* identification of challenging source types : * our main conclusion is that it may be feasible to identify the source population of origin of high - energy neutrinos even for some of the challenging source types such as starburst galaxies or agns using next generation high - energy neutrino observatories .",
    "strong cosmic evolution , nevertheless , reduces the probability of source identification .",
    "* source catalogs are critical : * search sensitivity using a source catalog exceeds that of using only the closest sources , and beyond some threshold distance , extending the source catalog further brings only marginal improvement .",
    "3 .   * required catalog depth * : we find that , for typical angular resolutions @xmath121 , it is viable to have a complete source catalog out to @xmath1mpc . a complete catalog out to this distance can not be significantly improved by going to higher distances , except if high accuracy direction reconstruction is available ( @xmath122 ) , or for lower number - density source types such as blazars .",
    "* role of detector characteristics : * we examined the role of the detector s ( i ) angular resolution , ( ii ) size and ( iii ) veto capability in source identification .",
    "we characterized results in comparison to icecube - gen2 in sunflower 240 configuration with a search for the highest energies with @xmath117tev neutrinos , with typical angular uncertainty of 0.3@xmath123 .",
    "size was assumed to identically change @xmath76 and @xmath77 , while veto capability changes @xmath77 only . we find that , for angular resolution and detector size , a factor of 2 change corresponds to a change in identification probability , @xmath124 , of roughly 20% .",
    "the dependence is somewhat weaker for veto power .",
    "these results are consistent with the analytical estimates of bartos @xcite , who finds the following scaling relationship for the probability that the source of high - energy neutrinos will be identified : @xmath125    the utilization of source catalogs can be further improved over the method presented above .",
    "for example , the neutrino luminosity for each source can be incorporated in the anisotropy , and the angular distance of the neutrino and source directions can be explored as a probability density functions .",
    "further , the incorporation of neutrino energy probability densities could improve sensitivity and combine the benefits of the low and high - threshold searches presented here .",
    "such changes will further improve the prospects of using source catalogs .",
    "additionally , the assembly of deep and complete source catalogs will be critical in maximizing the reach of multimessenger studies @xcite .",

    "<S> nevertheless , the origin of these neutrinos is still unknown . while it would be more straightforward to identify a transient , or galactic source class , finding a population of distant , continuous sources is challenging . </S>",
    "<S> source classification will benefit from using all available information , including catalogs of source candidates . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the prospects of using source catalogs to find the neutrinos origin . considering a multi - year observation campaign with the proposed icecube - gen2 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that ( i ) the origin of cosmic neutrinos can be probed if the direction of neutrino track events can be reconstructed with a precision @xmath0 even for the most challenging source populations : starburst galaxies and agns ; ( ii ) we quantify the utility of source catalogs as a function of depth ; we find that a source catalog of @xmath1mpc can be sufficient for the most challenging source types , which is useful as it is difficult to assemble complete catalogs for greater distances . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) we characterize the role of detector properties , namely angular resolution , size and veto power ; we find that a factor of two change in angular resolution compared to @xmath2 , or detector size compared to that of icecube - gen2 with sunflower 240 configuration , changes the probability of identifying the source of origin by @xmath3 . </S>"
