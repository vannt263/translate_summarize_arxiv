    "in this section we will analyse the thermodynamic stability of a rotating black hole in minimal five - dimensional gauged supergravity in the canonical ensemble .",
    "an important quantity is the specific heat at constant pressure @xmath38 , charge @xmath40 and angular momenta @xmath41 , @xmath42 @xmath73 the ensure stability , the specific heat has to be positive .",
    "additionally the isothermal moment of inertia @xmath74 must be considered .    however , in this spacetime we have two angular momenta , so that the isothermal moment of inertia turns into a tensor @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "for stability it is required that both of the eigenvalues of the moment of inertia tensor are positive @xcite .",
    "a third condition for thermodynamic stability is the positivity of the adiabatic compressibility @xcite @xmath78 the specific heat , the isothermal moment of inertia and the adiabatic compressibility can be found analytically in terms of the metric parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath5 , but the formulas tend to be extremely lengthy , so we will not display them here .    to calculate the specific heat ,",

    "now the specific heat can be written as @xmath81 the derivatives @xmath82 and @xmath83 can be found from @xmath84 and @xmath85 , since @xmath86    to find the isothermal moment of inertia tensor ( see also @xcite ) , we fix @xmath5 and substitute @xmath80 into the angular momenta ( equation ) the angular velocities ( equation ) and the temperature ( equation ) . from the condition @xmath87 and therefore @xmath88 we get the partial derivatives @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "these can be used to calculate @xmath91 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath92 can be inverted as a matrix and finally the moment of inertia tensor is @xmath93 @xmath94 has two eigenvalues @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which have to be positive for thermodynamic stability .",
    "the adiabatic compressibility can be calculated analogously to the specific heat .",
    "although we could not find a rigorous proof , the adiabatic compressibility was positive in all parameter ranges we tested ( as long as @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) , so we will not consider it in the following analysis .",
    "for the asymptotically ads kerr spacetime with two independent rotation parameters it is already known that @xmath99 is positive @xcite .",
    "+ figure [ pic : pd_stability ] shows the sign of the specific heat and the two eigenvalues of the isothermal moment of inertia tensor for different values of the charge @xmath40 .",
    "the parameters for the cosmological constant and the event horizon are fixed to @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "this leaves two free parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 , but since we want to display the sign of @xmath102 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 in dependence of the angular momenta , we perform a `` coordinate change '' in the plots from @xmath43 , @xmath44 to @xmath41 , @xmath42 using internal routines of the computer algebra system maple and equation .",
    "the grey regions correspond to positive @xmath102 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 while the white regions correspond to negative values and therefore instability .",
    "the system is thermodynamically stable if @xmath102 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are positive at the same time .",

    "the mass @xmath36 corresponds to the total gravitational enthalpy of the system . +",

    "the circle shrinks with increasing @xmath5 and @xmath40 , so that for large @xmath5 or @xmath40 there is only a unique phase of black holes .    the study of the free energy @xmath106 ( which is the gibbs free energy since @xmath36 is the enthalpy ) , confirms these results . in the case of two black hole phases ,",
    "the famous swallowtails are found in the @xmath68-@xmath39-plots .",
