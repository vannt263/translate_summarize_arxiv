    "therefore , we can prove lemma 5 .",
    "the group @xmath50 is not the whole group @xmath69 ( if @xmath192 ) , because its image in the symmetric group @xmath70 is generated by two involutions and therefore is a dihedral group .",
    "it is easy see that this image is the group @xmath193 which is a proper subgroup of @xmath70 .",
    "clearly @xmath3 is never generated by two involutions , for then it would be a quotient of the infinite dihedral group , and so would be virtually abelian . since the current known bounds are so close to being sharp , it is natural to ask for the sharpest bounds .    for each @xmath28 ,",
    "prove sharp bounds for the minimal number of involutions required to generate @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath9 determine whether or not @xmath194 is generated by 3 involutions .    in order to generate the extended mapping class group @xmath12 ,",
    "it suffices to add one more generator , namely the isotopy class of any orientation - reversing diffeomorphism .",
    "therefore , by replacing the involution @xmath78 with the reflection , we can get following result ;    for all @xmath28 and @xmath34 , the extended mapping class group @xmath195 can be generated by : +  @xmath36 @xmath37 involutions if @xmath9 ; +  @xmath38 @xmath39 involutions if @xmath10 .",
    "but in the case of @xmath25 , stukow showed the result that was stronger than corollary 12 .",
    "he proved that @xmath196 is generated by three involutions .",
    "then , we can consider following problem ;    can the extended mapping class group @xmath12 be generated by 3 involutions ?",
