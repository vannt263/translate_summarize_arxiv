    "it is well - known that pairing correlation is strongly affected by both temperature @xmath4 and angular momentum @xmath2 .",
    "the increase of temperature or angular momentum of a nucleus breaks the nucleon pairs located around the fermi surface , which are responsible for the pairing .",
    "the nucleons from the broken pairs scatter to the single - particle levels nearby and completely block these levels .",
    "consequently , pairing correlation decreases .",
    "when the temperature or angular momentum is high enough , i.e. , equal to its critical value @xmath5 or @xmath6 , these unpaired particles will block all the levels around the fermi surface , completely destroying the pairing correlation .",
    "however , when both temperature and rotation are combined as in warm / hot rotating systems , there appears an interesting effect of pairing reentrance .",
    "when the angular momentum of the system is slightly higher than @xmath6 , the pairing correlation , which is zero at low @xmath7 , reappears at @xmath8 , and decreases to vanish at @xmath9 .",
    "this phenomenon was first predicted by kammuri @xcite by applying the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer theory at finite temperature ( ftbcs ) and angular momentum to finite nuclear systems .",
    "it was later explained by moretto @xcite as follows . in the systems with @xmath10 , the increase of temperature relaxes the unpaired nucleons located around the fermi surface and therefore opens the possibilities for recreation of the pairs .",
    "however , if @xmath4 increases further , all of these newly created pairs will eventually be broken again , leading to the quenching of pairing correlation . a similar effect called unconventional",
    "superconductivity has been recently discovered in a superconducting urhge material at grenoble high magnetic field laboratory @xcite . in this experiment , urhge is normal when the magnetic field @xmath11 , which plays the role as that of nuclear rotation , is around 2 tesla , and becomes superconducting at low @xmath4 when the magnetic field increases between 8 and 13 tesla .",
    "it has been pointed out in several theoretical calculations that the collapse of pairing correlation at @xmath12 or @xmath13 , which signals the superfluid - normal ( sn ) phase transition , is a shortcoming of the ftbcs theory because it neglects the thermal fluctuations in finite systems such as atomic nuclei . in nuclear systems ,",
    "these thermal fluctuations are so large that they smooth out of the sn phase transition and lead to the non - collapsing of pairing correlation at @xmath14 @xcite . as the result , by taking into account the thermal fluctuations , the calculations within an exactly solvable model @xcite and the cranked shell model @xcite have shown a different behavior of the pairing reentrance phenomenon for which pairing gap , which is zero at @xmath10 and @xmath15 , reappears at a given @xmath4 but does not vanish as @xmath4 increases further . similarly , by including the quasiparticle - number fluctuations ( qnf ) at finite temperature and angular momentum , the recent ftbcs1 theory has also discovered an identical behavior of the pairing reentrance phenomenon in several realistic nuclei @xcite .",
    "apart from the ftbcs1 , the shell model quantum monte carlo simulation for @xmath16ge nucleus has suggested that the pairing reentrance can be seen not only in the behavior of pairing gap but also in the local enhancement of the nuclear level density ( nld ) at low @xmath4 and sufficiently high @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this suggestion has given the feasibility for this phenomenon to be experimentally observed .",
    "in fact , the very recent series of experiments conducted at the bhabha atomic research center ( barc ) for the reaction @xmath17c + @xmath18nb @xmath19 @xmath20ag@xmath21 @xmath19 @xmath0pd@xmath22 at the incident energy of 40 - 45 mev has observed an enhancement of the nld of @xmath0pd nucleus at low excitation energy @xmath1 and high @xmath2 , which is qualitatively similar to that predicted by the shell model monte carlo calculations  @xcite .",
    "the aim of present study is to apply the ftbcs1 theory including finite angular momentum to study if the enhancement observed in the experimentally extracted nld of @xmath0pd can be interpreted as the first evidence of pairing reentrance in a warm rotating finite nucleus .",
    "the pairing hamiltonian , which describes a spherical nucleus non - collectively rotating about the symmetry axis , chosen to coincide with its @xmath23 component , has the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the creation ( annihilation ) operators of a particle in the @xmath26-th deformed state , whereas @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the single - particle energies , chemical potential , and rotational frequency , respectively .",
    "the particle - number operator @xmath29 and the @xmath23-projection @xmath30 of the total angular momentum @xmath31 are defined as @xmath32 with the single - particle spin projection @xmath33 .",
    "the ftbcs1 equations including angular momentum are derived based on the variational procedures to minimize the expectation value of the pairing hamiltonian ( [ hp ] ) in the grand - canonical ensembles @xcite .",
    "the details are reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , so we do not repeat it here .",

    "it is worth mentioning that the ftbcs1 gap equation ( [ gapeq ] ) , which is level dependent , consists of two parts .",
    "the first part , @xmath34 , is similar to the conventional ftbcs , and the second part , @xmath49 , contains the qnf . by omitting the qnf @xmath41 ,",

    "the level density is calculated based on the inverse laplace transformation of the grand - partition function ( [ ome ] ) .",

    "the numerical calculations are carried out for @xmath0pd nucleus , whose single - particle spectra are taken from the axially deformed woods - saxon potential including the spin - orbit and coulomb interactions @xcite .",
    "the pairing interaction parameters @xmath68 are adjusted so that the neutron and proton gaps obtained within the ftbcs ( ftbcs1 ) at @xmath69 = 0 match those given by the empirical odd - even mass differences @xcite . the quadrupole deformation parameters @xmath70 of the woods - saxon potential are adjusted so that the nld obtained at different values of @xmath2 fit best the empirical ones , which are used in the cascade code to fit the experimental proton spectrum  @xcite , especially in the region where the enhancement of nld is observed .",
    "the variation of @xmath70 with @xmath2 is plotted in fig .",
    "this figure clearly shows that @xmath0pd nucleus undergoes a shape transition from the prolate shape ( @xmath71 ) to the oblate one ( @xmath72 ) at around @xmath2 = 20 @xmath73 .",
    "this transition seems to be reasonable in this mass region because of an alignment of protons in @xmath74 and neutrons in @xmath75 orbits@xcite .    shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a)-(f ) are the pairing gaps and nld as functions of excitation energy .",
    "the latter is defined as @xmath76 , which are obtained within the ftbcs and ftbcs1 at different values of @xmath2 and @xmath70 .",
    "it is clear from figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) that the neutron and proton gaps , which are obtained within the ftbcs ( thin lines ) , decrease with increasing @xmath1 at all @xmath2 , and collapse at some critical values @xmath77 . at the same time , because of the qnf , the pairing gaps , predicted by the ftbcs1 , do not collapse but monotonically decrease with increasing @xmath78 , and remain finite even at @xmath79 20 mev , except the proton gap at @xmath2 = 20@xmath73 [ dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) ] .",
    "the latter is zero at @xmath1 = 0 , increases with increasing @xmath1 to reach a maximum at @xmath80 3 mev , and then decreases to vanish at @xmath81 7 mev .",
    "this feature is caused by the change of shell structure , which takes place in the shape transition from prolate to oblate at this @xmath2 value .",
    "the pairing reentrance is therefore present in the ftbcs1 gaps at @xmath2 = 20@xmath73 for protons and @xmath2 = 30@xmath73 for neutrons [ dash dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) ] , whereas no signature of this effect is seen in the pairing gaps obtained within the ftbcs . as the result , there is no enhancement of the nld obtained within the ftbcs [ dotted lines in fig .",

    "the thin and thick lines in ( a ) and ( b ) denote the ftbcs and ftbcs1 results , respectively , whereas the dotted and dashed lines in ( c ) - ( f ) respectively stand for the ftbcs and ftbcs1 total level densities .",

    "this work studies the pairing reentrance phenomenon in a warm rotating @xmath0pd nucleus by the analyzing the pairing gaps and nld obtained within the ftbcs and ftbcs1 theories including finite angular momentum .",
    "the results obtained show that the pairing reentrance takes place only in the pairing gaps obtained within the ftbcs1 ( e.g. , for protons at @xmath87 and neutrons at @xmath88 ) , whereas this effect does not appear in the ftbcs gaps .",
