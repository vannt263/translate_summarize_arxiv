    "we begin by considering the properties of a single chain in the absence of any interchain coupling ; we treat this problem using abelian bosonization , which is based on the fact that the properties of an interacting 1deg at low energies and long wavelength are asymptotically equal to those of a set of two independent bosonic fields , one representing the charge and the other the spin degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "the widely discussed separation of charge and spin @xcite in this problem is formally the statement that the hamiltonian density @xmath23 can be expressed as = h_c+h_s , where the chain index is implicit , and the charge and spin pieces of the hamiltonian are each of the sine gordon variety , _ = 2 + v _ ( _ ) , where @xmath24 for the charge and spin fields , respectively , @xmath25 is the dual field to @xmath26 , or equivalently @xmath27 is the momentum conjugate to @xmath26 .",
    "we consider a sufficiently incommensurate 1deg and therefor set @xmath28 since it arises from umklapp scattering .",
    "of course , if the umklapp scattering is crucial to explain doped insulator behavior , its role can not be neglected . where there is no spin gap , or at temperatures large compared to @xmath29 , we can likewise set @xmath30 .    when @xmath31 is relevant , ( perturbatively , this means @xmath32 ) the spin gap is dynamically generated , _",

    "it is marginally irrelevant for repulsive interactions ( @xmath37 ) and marginally relevant for attractive interactions ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "thus , the long distance spin physics is described by @xmath39 with @xmath30 and @xmath40 for a gapless spin - rotationally invariant phase .",
    "where there is a spin gap in a spin rotationally invariant system , it is exponentially small for weak interactions , @xmath41 $ ] .    in order to compute correlation functions , we use the mandelstam representation@xcite of the fermion field operators _ , ( x)=n _ , [ eq : bose ] where @xmath42 contains both a normalization factor ( which depends on the ultraviolet cutoff ) and a `` klein '' factor ( which can be implemented in many ways ) so that @xmath42 anticommutes with @xmath43 for @xmath44 and commutes with it for @xmath45 .",

    "when analyzing results for this model , it is always important to remember that the parameters which enter the field theory are renormalized , and are related to the microscopic interactions in a very complicated manner .",
    "for instance , although for a single - component 1deg with repulsive interactions @xmath31 is always irrelevant , for multicomponent 1deg s , and for the `` 1deg in an active environment '' , it is common to find a dynamically generated spin gap , even when the microscopic interactions are uniformly repulsive.@xcite    the bosonized expressions for all electron operators are readily extended to an array of chains by adding a chain index to the bose fields and to the klein factors ; the klein factors on different chains must now anticommute with each other . where single particle interchain hopping is relevant , the klein factors appear explicitly in the bosonized hamiltonian . where only pair hopping and collective interactions between neighboring chains need be included in the low energy physics , the klein factors cancel in @xmath55 .",
    "while it is generally simpler to derive results concerning the spectrum , it is important for comparison with experiment to compute actual correlation functions .",

    "at temperatures large compared to @xmath11 and the spin gap , @xmath63 , ( or at all temperatures in systems in which @xmath64 ) , the 1deg exhibits `` luttinger liquid '' behavior . because the luttinger liquid is a quantum critical system , the response functions have a scaling form .",
    "specifically , this implies@xcite that g^<(k,;t)=t^2_c+2_s-1g^<(k/ t,/t;1 ) , where we define for @xmath65 or @xmath66 [ gammadef ] _ = ( k_+k_^-1 - 2 ) , and that so long as @xmath67 ,  ( k,;t ) = t^(k_s^-1+k_c-2)(k / t,/t;1 ) .",

    "this problem is most simply treated in terms of spin fermion fields , _ s,^= n_s .",

    "assuming there is a single massive phase of the sine gordon theory , the luther - emery model@xcite will exhibit the same asymptotic behavior as any other model in this phase .",
    "formally , the luther - emery point can be thought of as a strong - coupling fixed point hamiltonian , and @xmath77 , which vanishes at the fixed point , is the amplitude of a leading irrelevant operator.@xcite we will henceforth compute correlation functions at the luther - emery point , and then comment on the effects of deviations from this point .",
    "now , in computing the various spectral properties of the system , we can distinguish two regimes of temperature : at temperatures large compared to @xmath63 , the spin gap is negligible , and the results for the luttinger liquid apply .",

    "the explicit discussion of the nonanalyticities due at the three soliton threshold is new , although fairly obvious ; more muted singularities occur at the five and higher multisoliton thresholds , which we will not discuss explicitly .",
    "the specific expression in eq . ( [ eq : zs ] ) is , to the best of our knowledge , new , and is the most important feature of this result for the purposes of the present paper .",
    "the charge pieces of both response functions are unaffected by the opening of the spin gap .",

    "@xcite however , @xmath114 is a conserved `` chirality '' equal to the number of right moving minus the number of left moving electrons , so that we can still interpret @xmath115 as a sort of quasiparticle `` charge '' ; it represents the coupling of the quasiparticles to a magnetic flux.@xcite    the presence of the @xmath116 term in the single chain hamiltonian results in the quantization of @xmath112 in integer units .",

    "moreover , there is no qualitative change@xcite in the temperature evolution of this peak as the temperature is lowered from two or three times @xmath11 down to temperatures as low as at least 1/2 @xmath11 ; the character of the nodal excitation seems to be remarkably insensitive to the onset of superconductivity .",
    "by contrast , in optimally doped there is apparently@xcite no observable peak along the nodal direction , and indeed little or no spectral weight within about 0.5 ev of the fermi energy .",
    "indeed , recent neutron scattering studies@xcite of the low energy magnetic scattering in the neighborhood of @xmath271 have revealed the existence of a clean spin gap at low temperatures , which is apparently inconsistent with the existence of any gapless nodal quasiparticle excitations .",
    "it is clear that whatever spectral response is observed near @xmath272 is not associated with the vertical and horizontal stripes studied here , because a stripe wave vector does not span the `` fermi surface '' along this direction .",
    "it could be associated with diagonal stripes , which have been observed recently in various insulating materials,@xcite in which case the observed quantum critical behavior might truly be that of a luttinger liquid . an alternative picture is backflow associated with holes that have not condensed into vertical or horizontal stripes .",
    "both explanations are conceivable as there are strong reasons to expect that the orienting potential , which locks the stripes along a particular ( vertical or horizontal ) crystallographic direction to be stronger in than in .",

    "however , in the superconducting state , we expect the quasiparticles to be able to propagate coherently between chains . because these terms are irrelevant , their effects on the spectrum can be computed in ordinary degenerate perturbation theory .",
