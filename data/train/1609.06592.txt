    "after the discovery of the higgs boson in 2012 by the atlas and cms experiments  @xcite , the experimental higgs effort has transitioned to a full - fledged program of higgs characterization and precision measurements of its couplings to standard model ( sm ) particles",
    ". the direct observation of the higgs to vector bosons has been established at high significance  @xcite , while decays to taus and bottom quarks have yet to reach discovery significance and direct knowledge about the couplings of the higgs to first and second generation fermions is utterly lacking .",
    "the most straightforward information about light generation yukawas would come from direct decays of the higgs . while these are certainly viable possibilities for the charged leptons  @xcite , the inability to distinguish light quark - initiated jets from each other renders this avenue a practical impossibility , with the notable exception of charm tagging .",
    "a few studies  @xcite have investigated the prospects for identifying direct decays of higgs to charm jets , where bottom- and charm - jet tagging work in tandem to disentangle enhanced bottom and charm yukawa couplings .    aside from direct decays of the higgs to light quark jets , the other possibilities for measuring light quark yukawa couplings come from charm  higgs associated production  @xcite , which also requires a careful calibration of charm jet tagging efficiencies and a precise determination of higgs and associated jet backgrounds .",
    "the practical applicability of this technique is not well established , however , since a systematic treatment of higgs and non - higgs backgrounds is still absent .",
    "an enhanced light quark yukawa can also lead to significant effects in rare higgs decays to quark  anti - quark mesons and vector bosons  @xcite . the impressive control of theoretical uncertainty in these calculations and",
    "the corresponding proof of principle searches for such rare decays from @xmath4 and higgs bosons  @xcite make it an interesting channel to pursue . in these channels , though , interpreting a deviation from the sm expectation would require knowledge of the higgs vertices in the so - called indirect contributions .",
    "a deviation in the rate for @xmath5 , for example , could be attributed to a nonstandard effective coupling of the higgs to two photons as well as the charm yukawa coupling .",
    "hence , the realistic sensitivity of these rare higgs decays to nonstandard light quark yukawas suffers not only from the small expected sm rates , but also because the indirectness of the probe necessitates a combination with other higgs measurements .",
    "nevertheless , the power of combined fits to higgs signal strengths can not be discounted as an important tool in constraining nonstandard yukawa couplings  @xcite .",
    "such combined fits , however , are handicapped by the inability to determine the total width of the higgs and thus require model - dependent assumptions in order to extract higgs couplings  @xcite .",
    "for example , the possibility of exotic production modes of the higgs boson contaminating the higgs dataset  @xcite would introduce new physics parameters outside of the coupling deviation framework , spoiling the entire applicability of the @xmath6-framework .",
    "we see that many of the proposed tests of non - standard yukawa couplings have varied difficulties in experimental applicability or theoretical interpretation . while direct decay tests are best and subject to the least theoretical bias , the only potentially viable channel is the @xmath7 decay .",
    "production tests , like measuring @xmath8 production , are fraught with many backgrounds and experimental challenges regarding charm tagging .",
    "indirect tests , whether via higgs rare decays to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) mesons and vectors or combined coupling fits to higgs data , are most robust when conducted as consistency tests of the sm .    in the spirit of offering new channels for probing the standard model yukawa couplings ,",
    "we motivate the charge asymmetry in vector boson associated higgs production at the lhc . as a proton - proton machine",
    ", the lhc handily favors @xmath9 production over @xmath10 production , mainly through the higgsstrahlung process @xmath11 . at the 14  tev lhc , for example , for @xmath12  gev , @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "we point out , however , that this inclusive charge asymmetry is dramatically changed if the light sm quarks have large yukawa couplings .",
    "concomitant effects from large light quark yukawa couplings , such as @xmath14 @xmath15-channel higgs production and a rapid increase in the total higgs width , provide additional channels for indirectly constraining enhanced quark yukawas .    in  sec .",
    "[ sec : yukawas ] , we provide a theory motivation and background on yukawa coupling deviations . in  sec .",
    "[ sec : charge ] , we discuss the charge asymmetry of @xmath16 in the sm and the modifications induced by anomalous light quark yukawa couplings .",
    "we then present a collider analysis for same - sign leptons targetting the @xmath0 charge asymmetry measurement in  sec .",
    "[ sec : collider ] , demonstrating that the charge asymmetry can be measured at the lhc to subpercent accuracy .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the question of fermion mass generation is a central aspect of the structure of the standard model .",
    "a nonstandard yukawa coupling in the sm lagrangian leads to unitarity violation for @xmath17 scattering amplitudes . in the higgs post - discovery phase , and in the absence of direct knowledge of the yukawa coupling for a given sm fermion @xmath18",
    ", we can calculate a unitarity bound from @xmath19 scattering  @xcite by requiring the partial amplitude satisfies unitarity , @xmath20 .",
    "the scale of unitarity violation is then given by @xmath21 where @xmath22  gev is the higgs vev , @xmath23 for quarks and @xmath24 for charged leptons .",
    "this unitarity violation is a general feature in theories with chiral fermion masses arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking if the fermion mass is mismatched with its yukawa coupling .",
    "a stronger bound on @xmath25 can be found by studying @xmath26 scattering to arbitrary numbers of longitudinal modes of electroweak bosons  @xcite .",
    "resolving the mass - yukawa coupling mismatch necessarily requires either new sources of @xmath27 breaking beyond the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) or new matter fermions which mix with the sm fermions . such completions would add new diagrams to the partial wave amplitude calculated above in precisely the necessary manner to remove the @xmath28 growth in the amplitude .",
    "we note that regardless of the source of the new sources of yukawa deviations , the unitarity bound can be far beyond the reach of the lhc .",
    "for example , light quarks with @xmath29 yukawa couplings ( which requires fine - tuning of sm and new physics lagrangian parameters to reproduce the physical light quark masses ) motivate @xmath30  tev as the scale of unitarity breakdown .",
    "although such a fine - tuned light quark mass is aethestically unappealing , such a mismatch between the quark mass and the higgs yukawa coupling can not be discounted from collider searches for heavy fermions , seeing that limits on vector - like top parters reach only the @xmath31  tev scale  @xcite .",
    "the unitarity bound and inadequacy of the ad - hoc renormalizable lagrangian can be simultaneously cast into more familiar language by appealing to dimension-6 effective operators for higgs physics . here , the sm provides the usual dimension-4 couplings that preserve the mass - coupling relation expected in sm physics , but the fermion masses and their yukawa couplings get additional contributions from dimension-6 operators .",
    "we have @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are matrices in @xmath37 flavor space of @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath38 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the flavor rotations of @xmath41 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 are then used to ensure the mass matrices @xmath42 are diagonal , with @xmath18 denoting up - type or down - type quarks , and we have expanded @xmath43 about its vev .",
    "importantly , these flavor rotations does not guarantee in general that the yukawa matrices @xmath44 are diagonal .",
    "simultaneous diagonalization of @xmath45 and @xmath46 simultaneously is not guaranteed unless they are aligned , and hence without additional assumptions , the yukawa terms in dimension-6 higgs effective theory are expected to introduce flavor - changing higgs couplings .",
    "moreover , phases in @xmath46 are not guaranteed to vanish , so we also expect @xmath47 violation in higgs couplings ( the overall phase in each yukawa matrix is not observable ) .",
    "bounds on both flavor - changing higgs couplings and @xmath47-violating couplings can be obtained from studying meson mixing  @xcite and electron and neutron dipole moment constraints  @xcite .    nevertheless , a large , enhanced diagonal coupling for fermions is readily achieved from  eq .  ( [ eqn : yukawa ] ) .",
    "note that for @xmath34 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we obtain yukawa enhancements @xmath6 of @xmath50 for first generation quarks , @xmath51 for second generation quarks , and @xmath52 for third generation quarks , precisely reflecting the universality of the dimension-6 higgs @xmath53 operator compared to the hierarchical structure of the sm yukawa matrix .",
    "in the standard model , @xmath0 production exhibits a charge asymmetry of 21.8% at the @xmath54  tev lhc  @xcite .",

    "we allow events with only one jet because the second jet from the higgs decay is too soft or merges with the first jet a significant fraction of the time .",
    "two - jet events are required to be consistent with a hadronic @xmath94 candidate , @xmath145  gev @xmath146  gev . since the subleading lepton typically arises from the higgs semileptonic decay , we require @xmath147  gev for two jet events .",

    "the primary search channel at the tevatron sensitive to @xmath15-channel higgs production was the @xmath109 decay mode  @xcite , which constrained @xmath194 br@xmath195 at @xmath189  gev to be less than 0.77  pb . if @xmath196 and br@xmath195 are held fixed , then this constrains the extra production from @xmath197 at a level roughly a factor of 2 - 10 weaker than the naive estimate in  eq .",
    "( [ eqn : naive ] ) , with the strongest constraints for @xmath198 and @xmath199 ; again , this is an inconsistent treatment of the bounds unless new physics is introduced to keep br@xmath200 fixed . in a similar manner , double higgs production rates",
    "are also increased , but their impact at the lhc is already excluded in a model independent fashion from the total higgs width measurement discussed earlier .    finally , probing enhanced quark yukawa couplings using the exclusive charge asymmetry measurement discussed in  sec .",
    "[ sec : collider ] requires also requires an increased @xmath201 partial width in order to maintain the signal rate comparable to the sm expectation .",
    "nevertheless , the measurement of the charge asymmetry provides an important consistency test of the sm higgs boson .",
    "moreover , the @xmath202 statistical precision afforded by the proposed @xmath203 measurement establishes a new channel to constrain and evaluate parton distribution functions and their uncertainties if light quark yukawa deviations are absent .",
    "in this work , we have explored the prospects for measuring light quark yukawa couplings at the lhc via the charge asymmetry of @xmath0 production . from the limited set of new physics operators considered , the net effect of enhanced light quark yukawa couplings was to rapidly increase the total higgs width , which can be tested in a model - independent fashion at the lhc in the high resolution @xmath165 and @xmath166 final states . enhanced",
    "light quark yukawa couplings satisfying with the direct higgs width constraint predict inclusive charge asymmetries that deviate significantly from the sm expectation .",
    "we hence motivated the possible measurement of the @xmath0 charge asymmetry in the exclusive mode @xmath204 + 1 or 2 jets , which is a clean same - sign dilepton final state that inherits the same charge asymmetry as the original higgs production process .",
    "after accounting for the main backgrounds from electroweak diboson production , we estimate that the individual @xmath148 and @xmath149 final states reach a statistical @xmath205 significance each with 300 fb@xmath3 of 14  tev lhc data .",
    "even though the higgs boson is not fully reconstructed in this decay , the clean same - sign dilepton signature can be readily extrapolated to the expected @xmath159 ab@xmath3 high luminosity run , enabling a statistical precision on the exclusive charge asymmetry of 0.4% .",
    "if the measured asymmetry deviates from the sm expectation , then a likely interpretation would be an enhanced sm light quark yukawa counterbalanced by additional new physics effects that preserve rough current consistency of the higgs data with sm expectation .",
    "a future deviation can favor enhanced down and up quark yukawas if the observed charge asymmetry exceeds the sm expectation , while strange and charm quark yukawas would be responsible if the charge asymmetry were smaller .",
    "the @xmath0 charge asymmetry hence provides an interesting and new consistency test for higgs measurements .",
    "we conclude by remarking that although we focused on the prospects for testing light quark yukawa coupling deviations using the charge asymmetry , this measurement also probes the higgs coupling to @xmath206 bosons directly , which adds a new ingredient in combined coupling fits for testing custodial symmetry .",
