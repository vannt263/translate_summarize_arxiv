    "the aspirations of 5 g network are reflected in the white papers published by the leading telecommunication companies @xcite .",
    "all of these white papers mention about the vision of more than @xmath0 gbps data rate . to facilitate our discussion , we need to know what are the data that will be encrypted and decrypted in a 5 g phone . we also need to know where and how many times the encryption and decryption will take place across the protocol stack on the phone . but 5 g is not yet a reality and we do not have exact answers to these questions .",
    "so , we assume things about a 5 g network and argue on the basis of those assumptions .",
    "we turn to the lte ( 3gpp defined 4 g network ) network and different white papers @xcite published by the leading telecommunication companies to make the assumptions . in an lte phone , the data that leave and enter the phone can be broadly classified into three categories .    1 .   the control signals in between the phone and the core network 2 .",
    "the control signals in between the phone and the radio network 3 .   the user data sent and received at the phone s application layer    both of the first two categories are confidentiality and integrity protected .",
    "for the third category , only the privacy is protected .",
    "also note that , from the volume point of view , the major share of data belong to the third category . comparing to the the third category , the cryptographic computation required for the data of first and second categories is negligible .",
    "the user data in an lte phone is only once encrypted and decrypted across the protocol stack in pdcp layer .",
    "for a 5 g phone , we assume the following :    1 .",
    "user data will remain as the major share of the total data leaving and entering the phone .",
    "the cryptographic computational need for the total volume of control signals will be negligible in comparison with that of the user data .",
    "3 .   the user data will only once be encrypted and decrypted somewhere across the protocol stack .",
    "4 .   in order to have a pessimistic estimation of energy consumption , we assume that integrity protection of user data will be introduced in 5 g .    based on these assumptions , we will look into the cryptographic energy requirements and also the total energy requirements across the protocol stack of an lte phone .",
    "then we will scale up the data - rate from @xmath1 mbps to @xmath0 gbps and see how much extra pressure it puts on the battery of the phone in comparison with other energy hungry aspects of the phone like display and radio signalling .",
    "the paper is organized by first giving a very short introduction to the architecture , the protocol stack and the cryptographic specifications of the lte network in section [ sec : lte_specifications ] . in section [ sec : throughput_and_energy_requirements_of_aes_snow3 g ] , we present the results found in the existing literature about the energy requirements of the two cryptosystems of interest , which are aes and snow 3 g .",
    "in this section we also present the results about the energy consumption across the whole protocol stack of the link layer . in section",
    "[ sec : overall_comparison ] we present the energy consumption distribution of the whole phone among its different functional modules and show that the energy needed for cryptographic computation is not a threat for the battery life of the phone .",
    "an lte network is comprised of broadly three components .",
    "the user equipment ( ue ) , evolved radio network ( e - utran ) known as radio network and evolved packet core ( epc ) known as core network .",
    "the user equipment consists of a mobile equipment ( me ) or a mobile phone for the context of this paper , and a universal integrated circuit card ( uicc ) .",
    "the uicc hosts an application called subscriber identification module ( sim ) . in this paper",
    "when we refer to the user equipment , we mean it to be the mobile phone since the uicc does not have much functionality to consume a lot of energy .",
    "the ue is connected to the network via a radio link only with the radio network .",
    "the entity of the e - utran that has the radio link with the ue is called enodeb which is tradionally known as a base station .",
    "however , the ue also establishes a direct logical connection with an entity of the core network known as the mobility management entity ( mme ) .",
    "this logical connection is used only for the control signals for the core network and hence we do not focus on it in this paper .",
    "the user data as mentioned in the introduction travels from the ue to the enodeb .",
    "figure [ fig : protocl_stack ] shows the protocol stack that the data travel across at the ue and at enodeb .",
    "the l1 layer is the physical layer .",
    "we logically bundle the packet data convergence protocol ( pdcp ) , radio link control ( rlc ) , and medium access control ( mac ) layers as layer 2 ( l2 ) .",
    "all the encryption and decryption takes place at the pdcp layer @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite , there are two mandatory sets of security algorithms in the 4th generation cellular network ( lte ) developed by 3gpp .",
    "one is eea1 in which the stream cipher snow 3 g is used .",
    "the other is eea2 in which the block cipher aes is used .",
    "the aspiration for the 5 g networks is to obtain at least 1gbps data - rate .",
    "the question arises if there are implementations of these two encryption systems that can achieve the required throughput and still be energy efficient enough to be used in a mobile phone .",
    "in @xcite , the authors showed in their experiment that the computing power of a single embedded processor even at high clock frequency is not enough to cope with the l2 requirements of lte and next generation mobile devices .",
    "the aes decryption was identified as the major time critical software algorithm , demanding half of the execution time of entire l2 of downlink ( dl ) .",
    "so , advanced hardware acceleration methods were required while keeping the energy and area requirements at a reasonable level for a mobile phone .    in a study conducted on the l2 dl @xcite",
    ", the authors had shown that by a smart dma ( direct memory access ) controller , the required throughput for lte which is at most @xmath1 mbps can be achieved .",
    "they used faraday s @xmath2 nm cmos technology , @xmath3-bit data path and @xmath4 round transformations for aes .",
    "however , to achieve this required throughput , the implementation consumed 9.5 mw of power whereas aes and snow 3 g each required @xmath5 and @xmath6 mw of power respectively .",
    "so , the decryption consumes around 5 percent of the power budget of l2 dl . from energy point of view , it consumes @xmath7 mj of energy to decrypt @xmath0 gb of data . in (",
    "* figure 6 ) the detailed comparison is presented . in section [ sec : overall_comparison ] , we will see that this is indeed a very small amount of energy when compared with total amount of energy consumed by the phone while exchanging bulk amount of network data .    from the experience of lte (",
    "* fig 9 ) , we see that the energy requirements of radio interface technology ( downlink ) in lte increases linearly as the data rate increases but with a small slope . on the other hand , energy requirements for encryption increases linearly as the data rate increases with slope @xmath0 .",
    "5 g has unprecedented data rate of 1 gbps .",
    "consequently , even though it is evident in lte that ciphering is not very expensive , it needs to be rigorously investigated to conclude that it will not be very expensive in 5 g . in the following sub - sections we present some implementations of aes and snow 3 g .      since the adoption of rijndael as aes by nist ,",
    "there have been a number of hardware implementations of aes .",
    "it is understandable that throughput and energy consumption are not mutually exclusive . in the beginning , the focus was completely on achieving high throughput . over the time",
    "the need for high throughput , yet energy efficient implementations became more pressing and studies concerning the energy consumption of the implementations became available .",
    ".aes implementations [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     they too do not provide any power / energy figures . fortunately , in @xcite , the authors have used the snow3 g implementation of ip cores inc . and have estimated that using 4 parallel blocks of snow3g1 with hard macro storage , a throughput of 30 gbps is achievable at @xmath8 mhz while consuming @xmath9 mj of energy per second .",
    "we scale down the frequency by @xmath10 times and expect the energy consumption per second will also be scaled down at the same proportion . according to that assumption , at @xmath11 mhz @xmath12 mhz",
    ", we should be able to harness the throughput of @xmath0 gbps by spending @xmath13 mj @xmath14 mj of energy .",
    "the authors estimated the power consumption on a gate - level netlist by back - annotating the switching activity and using synopsys power compiler tool .",
    "the overall energy consumption of a phone depends on the usage pattern of the user of the phone .",
    "radio activities of the cellular network , lighting up the screen , touch screen and cpu are the commonly considered as the most energy hungry aspects of a smart phone @xcite .",
    "there are times when a smart phone remains idle and does nothing for a long duration of time . during this time it switches to a suspended state by transferring the state of the phone to the ram . in suspended state",
    "the phone draws a minimal amount of energy from the battery to maintain the state in the memory and receive very limited control signals from the network to be able to receive the incoming traffic . in @xcite , the authors conducted an experiment on a @xmath15 g phone and two cutting edge @xmath16 g phones of the time .",
    "they showed that in suspended state , a @xmath15 g phone drew @xmath17 mj of energy per second whereas the 3 g phones drew around @xmath18 mj per second .",
    "there is another state when the phone is awake but no application is running .",
    "this state is called the idle state . in @xcite",
    ", the authors showed on the same phones that during idle state the amount of energy drawn was less than @xmath19 mj per second .",
    "normally , the time duration a smart phone is in a suspended or idle state is much longer than that of when it remains active .",
    "so , the energy consumption of the phone during idle or suspended state is very critical for the battery life .",
    "however , during these times , the phone hardly encrypts or decrypts any data except the control signals which are mostly paging messages .",
    "the reason is that the attach procedure takes place only when the user switches on the phone and tracking area update takes place frequently only when the user is travelling on a vehicle .",
    "however , even though paging itself is a burden for the phone from energy point of view , the cryptographic energy requirement for paging message is insignificant .",
    "according to @xcite , even with traditional paging mechanism , there are @xmath20 paging messages for a phone in an hour , which is less than @xmath0 in a second .",
    "according to @xcite , the paging message is no longer than hundreds of bytes .",
    "the energy requirements for aes for this tiny amount of data is very insignificant to the total need @xmath18 mj per second during the suspended state and of 300 mj during the idle state .    to understand the energy expense of encryption , we need to focus on the total energy expense of the phone during the active states of the phone when",
    "encryption is also being performed .",
    "such active states are phone call , web browsing , email , network data exchange ( upload / download ) and so on .",
    "we choose to focus on the case of network data exchange to argue our case .",
    "we assume that the phone would utilize its full download or upload capacity from the data volume point of view during the exchange .",
    "we will investigate this case for 2.5 g , 3 g and 4 g phones to see the evolution the energy requirements .    in @xcite",
    ", the authors showed that the @xmath15 g phone consumed around @xmath21 mj of energy per second during the network data exchange . around @xmath22 mj of this energy budget",
    "is spend for cellular network activities .",
    "we know in @xmath15 g , the maximum data rate can be 115 kbps . at that rate the aes implementation in @xcite would spend around @xmath23 mj of energy per second which is of course very insignificant .",
    "the authors of @xcite also showed that the 3 g phones consumed a similar amount of total energy during data upload / download which is around @xmath24 mj per second .",
    "considering the connection exchanged the data at its full capacity ( 7.2 mbps ) , the energy share for encryption is around @xmath25 mj which is also very insignificant .",
    "both in the 2.5 g and 3 g phone the major energy share for network data exchange is attributed to the radio transmission .",
    "however , there has been a significant change in the lte radio technology and has become even more expensive from energy consumption point of view . in lte",
    ", there are different radio states and the phone promotes and demotes to different states to save energy . as a result even though lte becomes less energy efficient than 3 g for small data transfer , it remains as efficient as 3 g in large size data transfer .",
    "also , there is a significant difference in the energy consumption of lte uplink and downlink . according to (",
    "* fig 9 ) , the lte uplink consumes @xmath26 j of energy per second while uploading at the rate of @xmath27 mbps . from the figure it appears that the energy consumption increases linearly with the uploading data rate with a factor of more than @xmath0 .",
    "downloading on the other hand , is less energy expensive , consuming @xmath28 j of energy per second at the rate of @xmath29 mbps .",
    "the energy consumption while downloading also increases almost linearly but with a very small factor after @xmath30 mbps . with screen off",
    ", the authors claimed that the energy was mostly consumed by the radio interfaces .",
    "the aes implementation in @xcite consumes @xmath31 mj of energy per second providing throughput of @xmath0 gbps . in order to come up with a loose bound ,",
    "let us consider that the lte uplink and downlink would consume the same amount of energy even when the data rate is at the theoretical peak , which is @xmath1 mbps and around @xmath2 mbps downlink and uplink respectively .",
    "then the energy share of encryption is still bounded by @xmath32 percent .",
    "it should be noted here that the high energy requirements in lte are mostly attributed to its radio interface technology .",
    "nevertheless , the radio technology will be different in 5 g than that of lte .",
    "let us consider that the lte draws @xmath33 mj of energy per second while transferring data at the theoretical maximum data rate .",
    "let s assume that in 5 g , the radio interface will draw @xmath34 mj of energy while providing the throughput of @xmath0 gpps by using its new efficient radio technology .",
    "we know implementations of aes and snow 3 g that take @xmath31 and @xmath35 mj of energy per second to provide throughput of @xmath0 gbps .",
    "so , the energy share of encryption in 5 g is @xmath36 percent for aes and @xmath37 percent for snow 3 g . considering that the integrity protection will also be incorporated for user data , the cryptographic effort will at",
    "most be doubled and hence they will be at most @xmath38 and @xmath39 percent for aes and snow 3 g respectively .    however , we do nt know the value of @xmath40 for certain . energy efficiency is a major concern for 5 g network",
    ". operators explicitly mention a reduction of total network energy consumption by 50 percent despite an expected 1,000-fold traffic increase @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it concludes that 5 g systems with high energy performance should be built on two design principles .",
    "one is to only be active and transmit when needed and the other is to only be active and transmit where needed . in our above discussion",
    "the @xmath33 is considered as the energy only when data is being transmitted or received and does nt include the energy when no data is being exchanged .",
    "we havent found any account on how much more energy efficient 5 g uplink and downlink will be .",
    "it is difficult to answer as there will be different radio interfaces involved .",
    "search for a reasonably accepted value of @xmath40 would be a further research question . very optimistically even we consider the value of @xmath40 to be @xmath30 , the cryptographic energy share still remains below @xmath0 percent .",
    "number of energy efficient implementations of aes and snow 3 g have been presented .",
    "some of the implementations use the multiple cores of the cpu of the mobile phone while others use asic .",
    "we have found that the asic implementations can provide the required throughput of 5 g .",
    "we made assumptions about a 5 g network .",
    "based on the assumptions and energy consumption related facts of lte network available in the literature , we have shown that energy consumption for cryptographic computation is insignificant compared to the total energy need of the phone when bulk data transfer takes place .",
    "it should be noted that there might have other implementations of aes and snow 3 g which are more energy efficient and provide the required throughput .",
    "but we did not look into any other implementations as it is evident that even with the implementations presented in this paper keeps the cryptographic energy share very low .",
    "however , as 3gpp advances on defining the 5 g standards and more results on the energy consumption of the radio interfaces of 5 g are published , the exact cryptographic energy share will be clearer .",
    "thanks to kimmo jrvinen for his help to understand the asic implementations and to jarno alanko for proofreading .",
