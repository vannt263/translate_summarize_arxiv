    "it has been pointed out long time ago  @xcite that there should exist bound and/or resonant states of heavy hadrons , dubbed ` molecular ' and arising due to the strong force between the light constituents of the heavy hadrons . indeed , considering the interaction between a heavy meson , consisting of a heavy quark @xmath2 and a light antiquark @xmath3 , and an antimeson ( @xmath4 ) ,",
    "it is clear that there is a normal strong force between such objects arising from an exchange of a light @xmath5 pair , which can be thought of as an exchange of light mesons .",
    "the range and the strength of the resulting strong interaction does not depend on the mass @xmath6 of the heavy quark @xmath2 in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "if the interaction corresponds to an attraction in some states of the heavy meson - antimeson pair , it should inevitably give rise to bound states in those channels at sufficiently large @xmath6 .",
    "however , given the lack of detailed knowledge of the strong interaction between heavy hadrons , it has not been clear , whether the charmed quark is heavy enough for the reasoning based on the heavy quark limit to be applicable , and thus whether resonances of such type with hidden charm do exist .",
    "another difficulty of identifying states with hidden charm as molecular , or more generically as four - quark systems , is that in most models of light meson exchange between charmed mesons  @xcite the interaction with the strongest attraction arises in channels with zero isospin and with non - exotic quantum numbers @xmath8 , which can be also realized as a conventional @xmath9 charmonium .",
    "for this reason it could be a typical situation that some dominantly four - quark states may be indistinguishable from states of charmonium , unless some other properties would favor a molecular interpretation .",
    "one such interpretation was argued in the past  @xcite for the resonance in the @xmath1 annihilation at the threshold of the @xmath10 production , then called @xmath11 , and presently referred to  @xcite as @xmath12 .",
    "it was noted that the cross section for production of the @xmath13 pairs accounted for more than one half of the total production of charmed meson pairs in spite of the very strong suppression by the @xmath14 wave kinematical factor @xmath15 at energy close to the threshold .",
    "thus it was suggested that there is a resonance very close to the threshold actually made from @xmath13 meson pairs .",
    "the idea of molecular states was revived in a modern context by the observation  @xcite in the belle experiment of the resonance x(3872 ) decaying into @xmath16 , and produced in the decays @xmath17 of the @xmath18 mesons .",
    "the resonance is quite narrow , and its width is not yet resolved ( @xmath19mev at 90% cl ) , and the updated value of its mass  @xcite @xmath20mev coincides within the errors with the mass of the @xmath21 meson pair : @xmath22mev .",
    "the extreme closeness of the newly observed resonance to the meson pair threshold is very suggestive of an interpretation  @xcite of this resonance as a ` molecule ' dominantly consisting of neutral charmed meson pairs : @xmath23 .",
    "the discovery  @xcite and observation  @xcite of x(3872 ) through the decay @xmath24 was followed by finding  @xcite also the decays @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "clearly , the co - existence of the latter decays with the discovery mode @xmath27 implies an isospin breaking in x(3872 ) .",
    "indeed the two - pion state and the three - pion one have opposite g parity , and one or the other would have to be forbidden if the isospin symmetry were applicable in the decays of @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , the existence of the radiative decay @xmath26 requires @xmath29 to have positive c parity , and the two - pion system emitted in the decay @xmath30 has to be in a c - odd state , which corresponds to the isospin of this system equal to one : @xmath31 . thus the @xmath28 resonance is required to have a substantial @xmath32 component , which is impossible for a pure @xmath9 charmonium . in other words ,",
    "the resonance has to contain light @xmath33 and/or @xmath34 quark pairs in addition to hidden charm , which thus qualifies it as a four - quark state .",
    "moreover , the decays @xmath35 and @xmath25 have comparable rates  @xcite , which implies that the x(3872 ) resonance does not have a definite isospin , and is mixture of @xmath32 and @xmath36 states .",
    "in addition , a subsequent study  @xcite of the angular correlations and the dipion mass spectrum in the decay @xmath24 strongly favors the spin - parity assignment @xmath37 for the x(3872 ) . combined with the extreme proximity of its mass to @xmath38 the known properties of x(3872 ) most",
    "strongly suggest that a sizeable part of the wave function of this resonance is contributed by the c - even @xmath39-wave state of charmed meson pair @xmath40 , which thus has the quantum numbers @xmath41 .",
    "the binding energy @xmath42 of the neutral meson pair in x(3872 ) is small : likely @xmath43mev . in this scale the mass gap @xmath44 between the corresponding threshold for the pair of charged mesons and that for the neutral ones @xmath45mev is large enough to suppress the weight of the state @xmath46 in the wave function of x(3872 ) , thus explaining the unusual isotopic properties of the resonance .",
    "generally , the wave function of the resonance x(3872 ) can be written in terms of a fock decomposition : @xmath47 where first two terms correspond to the ` molecular ' states of charmed meson pairs , and the  other \" states in the sum describe the admixture of non - molecular states , such as e.g. a @xmath48 charmonium @xmath9 pair .",
    "the latter states are localized at shorter distances within the range of the strong interaction , while the ` molecular ' part refers to the motion of the charmed mesons at ( mostly ) the distances beyond the range of strong interaction  @xcite . at the latter distances",
    "the coordinate wave function @xmath49 for each pair is that of a free motion : _",
    "n(r)= ( -_n r ) r  , [ phin ] for the meson combination @xmath50 and _ c(r)= ( -_c r ) r  , [ phic ] for @xmath51 .",
    "the virtual momenta @xmath52 and @xmath53 are related to the binding energy @xmath42 and the reduced mass of the two - meson system @xmath54mev as @xmath55mev@xmath56 and @xmath57mev .",
    "the dominance of the @xmath58 at long distances translates into a substantial isospin violation in the processes determined by the ` peripheral ' dynamics , examples of which are apparently the observed decays @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "it is quite likely however that this isospin - breaking behavior is only a result of the ` accidentally ' large mass difference @xmath61mev between @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "therefore it is natural to expect that at shorter distances within the range of the strong interaction the isospin symmetry is restored and at those distances the wave function of @xmath28 is dominated by @xmath36 , so that the ` core ' of the wave function of x is an isotopic scalar .",
    "then the wave functions of the @xmath64 and @xmath58 should coincide at short distances , which allows to estimate the relative statistical weight of these two states in the x(3872 ) resonance ( i.e. the ratio of the corresponding coefficients in eq .",
    "[ fock ] ) : = _",
    "[ wrat ]    strictly speaking , the wave functions in eq .",
    "[ phin ] and eq .",
    "[ phic ] can not be applied at short distances in the region of strong interaction , where the mesons overlap with each other and can not be considered as individual particles . in order to take into account this behavior an ` ultraviolet ' cutoff should be introduced .",
    "one widely used method for introducing such cutoff is to consider the meson wave functions only down to a finite distance @xmath65 , at which distance the boundary condition of the state being that with @xmath36 is imposed ( a discussion of a similar situation can be found e.g. in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "an alternative , somewhat more gradual cutoff , described by parameter @xmath66 , can be introduced@xcite by subtracting from the wave functions ( [ phin ] ) and ( [ phic ] ) an expression @xmath67 .",
    "one can also readily see , that an introduction of any such cutoff eliminates relatively more of the charged meson wave function than of the neutral one , thus reducing the estimate of the relative statistical weight as compared to that in eq .",
    "[ wrat ] , so that eq .",
    "[ wrat ] gives in fact the upper bound for the ratio .",
    "the peripheral @xmath58 component with the quasi - free mesons should give rise to the decays @xmath68 and @xmath70 due to the underlying decays of the @xmath71 and @xmath72 mesons .",
    "the widths of the corresponding underlying decays can be deduced from the available data  @xcite : @xmath73kev and @xmath74kev . in the c - even state x(3872 )",
    "the amplitudes of the decays @xmath75 and @xmath76 interfere constructively and the result for the rate of the decay of @xmath29 can be written as  @xcite ( x d^0 |d^0 ^0)=2 |a_0|^2 _  , [ gampi ] with @xmath77 describing the non coherent contribution of the decays from @xmath71 and @xmath72 and @xmath78 being the interference term .",
    "the dependence of these coefficients on the binding energy @xmath42 is shown in figure  [ gampw ] . as can be seen from the plot",
    "the interference is quite important at @xmath42 as small as 0.1mev and its relative importance increases with @xmath42 , since at stronger binding the distance between the mesons in x(3872 ) becomes shorter .",
    "the overall fall - off of both @xmath79 and @xmath18 at larger @xmath42 is the result of the decrease of the phase space for the decay .     and",
    "@xmath18 in eq .",
    "[ gampi ] on the binding energy @xmath42.,width=302 ]    the amplitudes of the radiative transitions @xmath80 and @xmath81 interfere destructively in the decay @xmath82 .",
    "the expression for the rate has the form  @xcite : ( x d^0 |d^0 ) = _    approximated by that in the free meson decay @xmath80 : @xmath83mev , due to the fact that the weak binding only slightly spreads the photon spectrum in the decay @xmath70 near @xmath84 , as can be seen from the plots shown in figure [ gspectrum ] .",
    "the shape of the spectrum is determined by the wave function of the meson pair in the x(3872 ) and thus a measurement of this shape is a direct probe of the motion of the mesons in the ` molecule ' .    ,",
    "at @xmath85mev ( dashed ) and at @xmath86mev ( solid),width=302 ]    it can be noted that the other kinematically allowed radiative decay channel @xmath87 should be quite suppressed  @xcite . the suppression of the direct peripheral contribution due to the transitions @xmath88 arises from the discussed small overall statistical weight of the @xmath89 state in the wave function ( [ fock ] ) and from a strong destructive interference between the amplitudes of the processes @xmath90 and @xmath91 due to a significantly shorter spatial separation of the charged mesons in x(3872 ) .",
    "the contribution due to the final - state rescattering @xmath92 is also very small  @xcite due to the @xmath15 behavior of the scattering @xmath93 very near the threshold below the @xmath94 resonance . the most efficient way of producing the @xmath95 final state in the decay of x(3872 ) appears to be due to the transition @xmath96 from the ` core ' of the x resonance .",
    "notice however that such transitions result in the photon energy @xmath97mev i.e. well below the peak from the peripheral process ( cf .",
    "figure [ gspectrum ] ) .",
    "the structure of the ` core ' of the x(3872 ) resonance represented by the ",
    "other \" states in the wave function ( [ fock ] ) is largely unknown and in discussing this part we have to resort to general considerations and quite approximate estimates .",
    "one such general property based on the heavy quark limit for charmed quarks is the spin - selection rule for the @xmath9 pair in x(3872 )  @xcite .",
    "namely , unlike a generic four quark state , the @xmath39 wave c - even @xmath98 state is unique in the sense that the total spin of the heavy @xmath9 pair is fixed : @xmath99 .",
    "indeed , for the s wave there is no orbital motion , and the total spin of the state is given by the vector sum of the spins of the @xmath9 and @xmath100 quark pairs : @xmath101 .",
    "however the states of the type @xmath102 and @xmath103 have negative c parity : c=-1 . only the state @xmath104 results in c=+1 .",
    "the total spin of the light quark pair is not ` traceable ' , i.e. can be flipped in the mixing with the  core \" states .",
    "the heavy quark spin however is conserved in the limit @xmath105 .",
    "therefore one arrives at the spin selection rule ( valid up to @xmath106 ) : the states with @xmath99 dominate in the fock sum in eq .",
    "[ fock ] for x(3872 ) .    as one application of the spin selection rule one can consider hadronic transitions from x(3872 ) to the charmonium states .",
    "the spin selection rule implies that the transitions to the spin - singlet charmonium levels such as @xmath107 should be suppressed while the transitions to spin - triplet states should be allowed .",
    "the latter include the observed decays @xmath30 , @xmath108 and @xmath26 , and also the yet unobserved decays to the spin - triplet @xmath109 levels : @xmath110 .",
    "the conservation of the spin of the @xmath9 pair implies the statistical behavior of the decay rates : ( x ^0 _ cj ) ( 2j+1 )  , and an approximate estimate of the absolute rate  @xcite suggests that the width of the decay @xmath111 can be as large as about @xmath112 .",
    "the core of the wave function of the x(3872 ) resonance is located at short distances .",
    "thus it is natural to expect that the production of the resonance in hard processes proceeds through the production of the core .",
    "furthermore , the quantum numbers @xmath41 can be realized in a @xmath48 @xmath9 state , so that one can expect that the production properties of the x resonance should be similar to those of charmonium with the rates scaled by the statistical weight of the core @xmath113 .",
    "the hard processes where x(3872 ) has been observed so far are the decays @xmath114 and the production in the proton - antiproton annihilation .",
    "the analysis by cdf  @xcite suggests that the production of the x(3872 ) in the @xmath115 collisions is indeed similar to that of the @xmath116 charmonium resonance .",
    "the similarity between the production of x(3872 ) and of the pure charmonium states allows to approximately estimate the weight factor of the core @xmath113 .",
    "indeed , it is an experimental fact that the known charmonium states are produced in @xmath18 decays in association with a single kaon with approximately the same rate ( within a factor of two ) .",
    "one might expect then that the core states of the @xmath28 are produced in similar decays at approximately the same rate , so that the only suppression factor in the observed  @xcite rate of decays @xmath117 is that of the probability weight @xmath113 , i.e. few percent .",
    "furthermore , as discussed , the core part of the wave function ( [ fock ] ) is expected to be dominantly an isotopic scalar , thus within such production mechanism one should expect that the decays @xmath118 and @xmath119 should have approximately equal rates  @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is significantly different from the calculation  @xcite of the ratio of these decay rates , based on the mechanism where the resonance is produced through its peripheral meson component .",
    "the latter mechanism predicts @xmath120 .",
    "the current data  @xcite on these decays = 0.50 0.30 0.05 tend to favor the core production mechanism , although an improvement of the experimental accuracy would be certainly helpful .",
    "the finding of x(3872 ) and the realization that this is likely a dominantly molecular - type state were quite unexpected , and the problem of understanding the dynamics of such states and predicting other possible instances of ` molecules ' still remains .",
    "although early papers  @xcite have provided the general idea of molecular hadronic systems , a detailed description of the strong interaction involving heavy and light quarks is still to be developed . in this section",
    "i briefly review some models which have been suggested after the discovery of the x(3872 ) .",
    "the model suggested by swanson  @xcite involves a calculation of the dynamics of coupled channels including the @xmath121 , @xmath122 pairs and also the pairs @xmath123 and @xmath124 , assuming a certain specific form of the hamiltonian for rearrangement of quarks between the hadrons .",
    "the model produced a successful prediction of the decay @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) with the rate comparable to that of the discovery decay mode @xmath127 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the model provides a detailed description of the decays of x(3872 ) to these channels as well as to @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 .",
    "i am not aware of predictions of this model for other resonances of this type with hidden charm , however the model predicts a @xmath131 resonance in the @xmath132 system at 10562mev and a @xmath133 state at 10545mev .    in the scheme of maiani",
    "_  @xcite the resonance x(3872 ) belongs to a large class of four - quark states for which the building blocks are color - antisymmetric diquarks and antidiquarks . in this model",
    "this resonance is identified as a @xmath131 state of the structure @xmath134_{s=1 } \\times [ { \\bar c } { \\bar u}]_{s=0}+   [ cu]_{s=0 } \\times [ { \\bar c } { \\bar u}]_{s=1}$ ] .",
    "the model predicts also @xmath135[{\\bar c}{\\bar d}]$ ] resonance with the mass splitting @xmath136mev , and also charged partners @xmath137 .",
    "none of the predicted resonances with masses very close to that of x(3872 ) were found so far .",
    "it can be mentioned in connection with a possible resonance of the @xmath138 type , that even if it exists , it may be quite difficult to observe it , since it is likely to be broad due to the allowed decay into pairs of neutral mesons : @xmath21 and @xmath139 .",
    "this remark however does not apply to the charged states @xmath137 .",
    "karliner and lipkin@xcite have recently considered a nonrelativistic quark model with pairwise interactions between the constituent quarks and antiquarks described by an oscillator potential and proportional to the gluon - exchange - type color correlation within each pair .",
    "the hamiltonian in the model has the form h=_ip_i^2 2 m_i+ _ i j v_0 4 _ c^i _ c^j r^2_ij  , [ klh ] with @xmath140 being the color @xmath141 matrices .",
    "the authors find that the model predicts four - quark bound states of the @xmath142 type , but not of the @xmath143 one .",
    "they suggest that the resonance x(3872 ) can still be explained within this model , once the spin - dependent forces are taken into account .",
    "the scheme considered by braaten and kusunoki  @xcite phenomenologically treats the near - threshold dynamics of the @xmath144 pair as being exclusively and universally determined by the pole in the scattering amplitude , corresponding to x(3872 ) , and conversely , the properties of the resonance as being totally determined by the meson pairs .",
    "this approach corresponds to an ` extreme ' molecular treatment of the resonance . in other words",
    ", it assumes the limit , where any other states in the fock decomposition in eq .",
    "[ fock ] are neglected in comparison with the first term , whose coordinate wave function is given by eq .",
    "clearly , such approach would miss the properties of x(3872 ) determined by its ` core ' , in particular , as discussed above , it appears that the core dominates the production of x in hard processes .    as a general remark",
    ", it can be mentioned that existence of the x(3872 ) as a dominantly @xmath144 shallow bound state , does not necessarily imply existence of nearby resonances , in particular of the charged partners @xmath137 .",
    "indeed , if a strong force due to exchange of isovector light - meson states ( @xmath145 ) contributes to the binding in the @xmath146 channel , the sign of such force would be reversed in the charged states , as can be readily seen from the figure  [ force2 ] : the relative sign of the two vertices for the exchanged isovector state is different between the two shown systems .",
    "the very strong enhancement of the @xmath1 production of the @xmath0 meson pairs very near the threshold is known for a long time , and it served as motivation for the suggestion  @xcite that this is an effect of a ` molecular ' type @xmath14-wave @xmath147 state of @xmath0 . indeed according to the new cleo - c measurements  @xcite ( which also agree with the old data  @xcite ) the cross section for @xmath148 at @xmath149 correspond in units of @xmath150 to @xmath151 even though the velocity @xmath152 of the @xmath153 mesons at this energy is @xmath154 and value of @xmath155 is proportional to the @xmath14 wave factor @xmath156 .",
    "it appears quite unlikely that such a strong enhancement of the production is possible without a singularity near the @xmath13 threshold .",
    "furthermore , the features in the cross section of the @xmath1 annihilation into channels with pairs of lighter mesons : @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 around the same energy , although present , are still of moderate amplitude  @xcite .",
    "this behavior points to an existence of a near threshold resonance , which is dominantly coupled to the @xmath13 channel and has only moderate coupling to pairs of lighter mesons .",
    "it should be mentioned that the strong @xmath15 growth of the cross section for production of the @xmath0 pairs above the threshold leads to the behavior where the local maximum of either the total cross section of the @xmath1 annihilation ( located close to 4040mev , hence the notation @xmath12",
    "@xcite ) or the cross section for the @xmath0 production , generally does not coincide with the actual position of the resonance .",
    "this position should be below the maximum of the @xmath0 production cross section , and can be either below , or above the threshold , or even between the thresholds for the neutral @xmath63 and charged @xmath160 vector mesons , which thresholds are split by about 6.6mev .",
    "the possible existence of a resonance dominantly coupled to @xmath0 generally leads to interesting features in the cross section for production of lighter meson pairs due to channel coupling  @xcite .",
    "a detailed experimental study of these features can potentially provide a very interesting information on the details of strong interaction between charmed mesons , and might shed some new light on understanding ` molecular'-type states .",
    "the phenomenon of reflection of the threshold onset in one channel on another coupled channel is well known ( see e.g. in the textbook @xcite , sect .",
    "however the specifics of the pure @xmath14 wave dynamics in the meson production amplitudes in the @xmath1 annihilation and the apparent presence of resonance near the threshold bring in interesting features , which justify a separate study of this phenomenon in the discussed context .",
    "in order to illustrate the reflection of a resonance near the @xmath0 threshold we neglect here the isotopic mass splitting between the @xmath153 mesons and note that the resonance couples to a specific coherent mixture of the two possible production @xmath14-wave amplitudes for the @xmath0 channel : one with the total spin of the vector mesons @xmath161 and the other with @xmath162 .   and",

    "this is due to the fact that at sufficiently small @xmath200 the damping of the ` light ' channel amplitude @xmath186 due to the absorptive term @xmath182 in the denominator in eq .",
    "[ al ] suppresses the ` light ' channel above the ` heavy ' threshold .    clearly , the significance of the discussed threshold effect critically depends on the value of the parameter @xmath200 for the near - threshold resonance . at least for two known resonances , @xmath94 and @xmath201 , at the thresholds of pairs of pseudoscalar heavy mesons",
    "the value of @xmath200 can be found from the data : @xmath202 mev for @xmath94 , and @xmath203 mev for @xmath201 .",
    "there is every reason to expect , from the observed onset of the @xmath0 production , that for the discussed possible resonance the coupling to the vector meson pair should be stronger than for the case of pseudoscalar mesons , and the parameter @xmath200 should be significantly smaller than for @xmath94 .",
    "the parameter @xmath200 is proportional to @xmath204 ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ wp ] )",
    ". therefore , it is quite likely that for the @xmath0 threshold resonance this parameter can be smaller than that for the @xmath94 by a factor of 10 or more .",
    "it would come as no surprise if the value of @xmath200 will be eventually found between 1 and 10 mev .",
    "the possible types of behavior of the production cross section in a ` light ' channel in the narrow energy range around the @xmath0 threshold is illustrated in figure  [ xsections ] for some representative values of the parameters , and where the isotopic splitting of the threshold is also taken into account .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the interference of the resonant amplitude with the non - resonant background is generally different for different channels , which may result in a significantly different behavior of the observed shape of the cross section for each channel .",
    "it is important to notice however that the features in the behavior of the cross section generally do not coincide with the position of the resonance .",
    "the shape of the cross section of the @xmath1 annihilation into the vector meson pairs @xmath0 above the threshold is only weakly sensitive to the parameters of the resonance and is dominated by the very rapid rise from the threshold due to the @xmath14 wave factor @xmath205 .",
    "as previously mentioned the threshold resonance should couple to a specific mixture of the states of the @xmath0 pair with the total spin @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "the coefficients in this mixture and their relative phase can be studied by measuring angular correlations in the production in @xmath1 annihilation near the threshold  @xcite .",
    "it would also be of interest to study the behavior of these coefficients with increasing energy in order to possibly untangle the resonant and the non - resonant production amplitudes .",
    "let @xmath206 and @xmath207 denote the production amplitudes for correspondingly the @xmath161 and @xmath162 states , normalized in such a way that the total cross section is given by @xmath208 .",
    "then the distribution of the production rate in the angle @xmath209 between the direction of the momentum of either of the mesons and the @xmath1 beams has the form 1-|a_2|^2 + 10    is not sensitive to the relative phase @xmath210 of the amplitudes @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "such sensitivity however arises in the distribution over the angle @xmath211 between the momentum of the parent @xmath153 ( @xmath212 ) and the @xmath213 ( @xmath214 ) emerging from the decay @xmath215 ( @xmath216 ) , or the similar correlation over the angle @xmath217 for the events with the decays @xmath218 ( @xmath219 ) .",
    "the angular distributions are expressed through the two discussed amplitudes as @xmath220 the latter two angular distributions however are not independent : one is found from the other by a simple substitution @xmath221 .",
    "the reason of course is that they both contain the same information about the vector meson polarization density matrix .",
    "thus measuring one or the other , or both , depends on the specific experimental setup .",
    "it is quite likely that in the resonance x(3872 ) we have come across a ` molecular ' state made out of dominantly @xmath222 and @xmath71 . although the existence of such states for  sufficiently heavy \" heavy hadrons was not unexpected theoretically , it was not clear whether the charmed mesons were heavy enough . given the present uncertainty in understanding the strong dynamics of systems of heavy hadrons it is by far not clear yet whether the x(3872 ) is a result of coincidence of several factors facilitating the binding , and no other such states in the charmonium mass region exist , or there are other similar states with hidden charm .",
    "one such candidate for a molecular state is the apparent strong threshold singularity in @xmath1 annihilation to @xmath10 .",
    "further theoretical understanding of the strong interaction between heavy mesons can be ( hopefully ) facilitated by a more detailed study of the resonance x(3872 ) and by a detailed scan of the @xmath1 annihilation into exclusive channels with charmed mesons in the vicinity of the @xmath0 threshold . in this respect",
    "the interesting studies which look feasible include the measurement of the decays @xmath223 , @xmath82 ( the photon spectrum in this decay is directly related to the motion of the mesons inside the x resonance ) , a search for the decay @xmath224 , which according to the presented discussion is sensitive to the transition @xmath96 , a search for the decays @xmath225 . for understanding the structure of the resonance",
    "very near the @xmath0 threshold in the @xmath1 annihilation it is most interesting to have a detailed scan of the production cross section for the lighter pairs : @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , since these channels may exhibit a quite intricate behavior sensitive to detailed parameters of the resonance .",
    "also a study of the angular correlations in @xmath226 near the threshold would provide an information on the ` hyperfine ' structure of the possible molecular state .",
