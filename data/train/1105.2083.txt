    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has emerged as a phenomenologically accurate theory that describes strong interactions among the six quark flavors that are bound into two families of hadrons , namely mesons and baryons . from experiments ,",
    "we understand that strong interactions enjoy c ( charge conjugation ) , p ( parity ) , t ( time reversal ) discrete symmetries of nature .",
    "therefore , qcd must also obey such symmetries , both separately and any combinations formed thereof @xcite .",
    "however , cp symmetry is broken in qcd due to the presence of the following term in the qcd lagrangian @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a periodic parameter , @xmath5 is the qcd coupling constant , @xmath6 is the color field strength tensor , and @xmath7 is its dual . the value of the @xmath4-parameter is not set theoretically , but it can be measured from the electric dipole moment of the neutron ( @xmath8 ) , for which many theoretical estimates exist but we only quote one , @xmath9 cm @xcite .",
    "here @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the quark mass matrix . the latest experimental estimate of @xmath12 cm @xcite constrains @xmath13 @xcite",
    ". this inexplicably small value of @xmath14 gave rise to the _ strong cp problem_. one of the solutions , also the most favoured , to this problem was envisioned by peccei & quinn @xcite , whereby the @xmath14 parameter is driven precisely to zero under a global chiral symmetry , later named @xmath15 .",
    "the pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson that results upon the spontaneous breakdown of this symmetry was dubbed the axion @xcite . not unlike the higgs boson ,",
    "the axion has proven to be extremely difficult to observe as it couples only weakly to ordinary matter and radiation .    despite several attempts to experimentally observe the axion",
    ", it remains elusive to this day .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental efforts have not gone in vain , but have been able to place serious constraints on the coupling strength of the axion to photons @xmath16 .",
    "stringent constraints have been placed on the mass of the axion @xmath17 ev with the lower limit arising from cosmology @xcite and the upper limit ev ) , a more relaxed upper limit is @xmath18 ev @xcite ] from the neutrino flux recorded for sn 1987a , which placed strong limits on the cooling flux through other channels namely , right - handed neutrinos or axions @xcite . if @xmath19 , the production of axions through the primakoff process will significantly alter the core he burning timescales of post main sequence stars , a possibility excluded by the ratio of horizontal branch stars in globular clusters @xcite .",
    "several reviews on the properties of axions have been forthcoming in the past decade , for example see @xcite , to which we point the reader for a more detailed and comprehensive exposition .    still , there is no denying the fact that none of the laboratory experiments conducted thus far have been able to secure a positive detection of this mysterious particle .",
    "the detection of very weakly coupled particles demands extremely sensitive laboratory experiments .",
    "so far , only a handful of experiments , namely the cern axion solar telescope ( cast ) @xcite , axion dark matter experiment ( admx ) @xcite , and rochester - brookhaven - fermilab ( rbf ) collaboration @xcite have been able to surpass the astrophysically derived limits on @xmath2 in the above quoted axion mass range . yet",
    ", the sensitivity envelope needs to be pushed even further by a few orders of magitude to be able to draw any definitive conclusions about the existence of the axion .",
    "plans are afoot to modifiy the existing experiments and devise new ones to improve upon current limits on @xmath2 ( see section iv ) .    unlike the laboratory experiments , the odds are in favour for detecting axions in astrophysical systems .",
    "this optimism stems from the fact that the axion to photon conversion probability scales with large magnetic field strengths and longer coherence lengths @xcite , such that @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the length over which both the photon and axion fields are in phase .",
    "thus , there is a very good chance of finding the axion in strongly magnetized compact objects , namely magnetic white dwarfs ( mwds ) and neutron stars ( nss ) .",
    "the possibility in the latter case has been expounded by many ( see for example @xcite ; also see @xcite where constraints on @xmath2 are derived from the dimming of radiation by photon - axion conversion in astrophysical sources ) , however , the case of the mwds has not been investigated in great detail and warrants further study .      after the discovery of the first mwd by kemp @xcite , the number of white dwarfs with magnetic fields ranging from a few kg to @xmath22 mg has grown to about 170 .",
    "the size of this subpopulation is only 3% of the total population of known wds comprising of 5447 objects .",
    "the main channel for identifying magnetism in wds is through zeeman spectropolarimetry , which not only allows one to discern the strength of the field but also the direction of the field lines , and also through cyclotron spectroscopy ( see for e.g. @xcite for a review on isolated and binary mwds ) .",
    "nevertheless , reconstruction of the field topology has proven to be very difficult , mainly due to its highly non - dipolar structure . over the last decade zeeman tomography of mwds",
    "has enjoyed some success in elucidating the underlying field structure .",
    "this technique is based on calculating a database of model spectra , where different field geometries comprising of single / multiple dipole , and higher multipoles , that may also be off - centered and misaligned with the rotational axis , are considered .",
    "then a least - squares fit using the pre - calculated synthetic spectra is performed through a highly optimized algorithm on the phase - resolved zeeman spectra to obtain the complex field structures @xcite .",
    "the generality of the models not only allows greater flexibility but also renders a closer fit to the actual field geometry of the source for a given rotational phase .",
    "the presence of even a small degree of circular polarization in the spectrum of a wd is a strong indicator of the object possessing a magnetic field upwards of @xmath23 g @xcite .",
    "the degree of circular polarization typically reaches up to @xmath24 , and sometimes beyond that in a few selective objects , near absorption features and also in the continuum .",
    "continuum circular polarization stems from the magnetic circular dichroism of the atmosphere , where the left and right circularly polarized waves propagating through a magnetized medium encounter unequal opacities @xcite",
    ". a relatively higher degree of circular polarization also appears near the red and blue shifted wings of the zeeman split absorption lines ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 components , @xcite ) .    on the other hand",
    ", most observations of mwds indicate that the linear polarization component never exceeds that of the circular one , and the spectrum remains dominantly circularly polarized until field strengths @xmath27 g are reached @xcite . in a magneto - active plasma ,",
    "the plane of linear polarization undergoes many faraday rotations , an effect that arises due to the magnetic birefringence of the medium , so that on average the degree of linear polarization of the emergent radiation is much reduced @xcite .    the very fact that linear polarization is of the order of a few percent ( @xmath24 ) in the continuum spectra of most mwds can be exploited to draw meaningful conclusions on the extent of axion interaction with photons traversing the magnetized plasma of mwds",
    "we explain how this can be implemented in the next section .",
    "the purpose of this study is to conduct a survey of the @xmath28 parameter space by modelling photon - axion oscillations in the magnetosphere of a mwd . to this end",
    ", we model the field structure of a strongly magnetized wd pg 1015 + 014 , for which high resolution optical spectropolarimetric observations are available @xcite . in the same article",
    ", the authors also conduct a phase - resolved zeeman tomographic analysis and derive a best - fit model of the magnetic field topology . despite fitting the spectrum with a range of field geometries",
    ", they were only able to pin down the field geometry for a single rotational phase by fitting it with a superposition of three off - centered and non - aligned dipoles of unequal surface field strengths ( see table [ tab : pg1015 ] for model parameters ) . to model the effect of photon - axion oscillation in the magnetosphere on the emergent polarization , we propagate an unpolarized photon of a given energy from the photosphere through the encompassing magnetosphere , that has been populated by a diffuse , cold ionized h gas . the emergent intensity and polarization is then averaged over the whole surface of the star . finally , we compare the degree of polarization from our model simulation to what is observed in mwds with field strengths in excess of a few @xmath23 g , for example pg 1015 + 014 , and draw conclusions on the strength of the coupling constant for a given axion mass .",

    "however , as shown by @xcite in the case of nss , an increase in magnetic field strength also increases the level of polarization by effectively shifting the polarization - limiting radius , the distance beyond which the two polarization modes couple and which depends weakly on the magnetic field strength @xmath147 , farther away from the star .",
    "the farther the polarization - limiting radius , the more coherently the polarization states from different loss add , yielding a higher degree of polarization .     parameter space .",
    "the red region corresponds to the case of mwd pg 1015 + 014 with @xmath135 g and limiting linear polarization @xmath148 .",
    "the blue and green regions correspond to the case with @xmath149 g , but with @xmath148 and @xmath150 respectively .",
    "the mass of the axion is constrained to @xmath151 ev from cosmology and sn 1987a measurments .",
    "the photon - axion coupling constant is capped from above with @xmath152 by the number of horizontal branch stars in globular clusters .",
    "ksvz @xcite and dfsz @xcite are two different theoretical models that predict how @xmath2 scales with @xmath51 .",
    "other exclusion regions are from lab experiments by the cast experiment @xcite , admx group @xcite and by rochester - brookhaven - fermilab collaboration @xcite ( color online).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "this study looks at how the production of axions in mwd magnetospheres can alter the state of polarization of the observed radiation . we find that unpolarized photons of photospheric origin become linearly polarized upon their traversal through the inhomogeneous magnetic field of a mwd .",
    "we have modeled the magnetospheric plasma , as fully ionized pure h with a barometric profile .",
    "since the majority of mwds are strongly circularly polarized and only show a relatively small degree of linear polarization , at most @xmath153 , we have used this observation to constrain the coupling strength @xmath2 of axions to photons .",
    "we find that for the case where the plasma component only contributes negligibly to the state of polarization , the coupling strength @xmath2 increases with the mass of the axion @xmath51 . the level of linear and circular polarization observed in mwds is sensitive to the properties of the magnetospheric plasma .",
    "the limits on @xmath2 can be improved by modelling all the radiative transfer effects in wd atmospheres and fitting the model spectra to real observations .",
    "magnetic fields stronger than that of mwds exist in nss .",
    "going back to the argument of how astrophysical objects , compared to laboratory experiments , benefit from longer coherence lengths ( see section i ) , in comparing mwds with nss , one finds that the latter are @xmath154 times more efficient in converting photons to axions and vice - versa .",
    "a number of studies have expounded on the subject of propagation of polarized radiation through the ns magnetosphere , where they have considered ir / optical radiation @xcite , and thermal x - rays @xcite produced at the surface of the ns .",
    "unfortunately , no x - ray polarimetry observations have been conducted partly due to the very low flux in x - rays from these objects , and also because none of the high energy telescopes are equipped with a polarimeter .",
    "x - ray polarimetry has been neglected for the last 30 years but it is hoped that some of the future space missions @xcite , for example the gravity and extreme magnetism small explorer ( gems ) @xcite , will fill this void in x - ray astronomy . in any case , as discussed by @xcite , nss are excellent laboratories for the detection of any light , weakly coupled pseudoscalar particle .",
    "the admx project , that employs a microwave cavity to search for cold dark matter axions , will begin its phase ii of testing in the year 2012 . with the new upgrades the admx project will be able to exclude @xmath2 up to the dfsz line in the same mass range as before .",
    "although outside of the range of axion masses probed in this study , the modified cast experiment has been able to exclude axions with @xmath155 for @xmath156 ev , becoming the first experiment to ever cross the ksvz line @xcite .",
    "the currently running cast experiment in its phase - ii will be able to exclude axions with @xmath157 ev with unprecedented sensitiviy in this mass range .",
    "an improved version of the _ light shining through wall _ ( lsw ) experiment ( @xcite , also see @xcite for a recent review on such experiments ) using fabry - perot optical cavities to resonantly enhance photon - axion conversion has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the projected limit in sensitivity to @xmath158 typically for axion masses @xmath159 ev achieved using 12 tevatron superconducting dipoles appears quite promising .",
    "further improvements in experiment design and optimization techniques yielding increased sensitivity to even smaller coupling strengths have also been suggested by many workers in the field , for example the use of the dipole magnets , each providing a field strength of 5 t , from the hadron electron ring accelerator ( hera ) at desy in hamburg in a 20 + 20 configuration can potentially exclude @xmath160 for @xmath161 ev @xcite .",
    "another proposed line of investigation to search for axion like particles ( alps ) is the use of resonant microwave cavities which are much similar in design to the optical lsw experiments discussed above @xcite .",
    "this method has already been employed to search for hidden sector photons @xcite and can prove to be a powerful tool in the case of axions .",
    "finally , the simplistic model assumed for the mwd atmosphere only yields an absolute upper bound on @xmath2 . a much tighter constraint can be obtained by adopting a more realistic atmospheric model and solving the equations of radiative transfer with the photon - axion oscillations included . such an analysis is outside the scope of this study , but it is hoped that the novel method discussed in this work will prove to be extremely useful in better constraining the properties of any alp .",
