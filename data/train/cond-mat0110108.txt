    "in the last decade , low - dimensional systems in which the fundamental ( quasi ) particles do not satisfy bose or fermi statistics have received a lot of attention . among the most famous examples",
    "are the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) systems .",
    "the quantum hall states at simple filling fractions @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an odd integer , are understood in terms of the famous laughlin states @xcite .",
    "quasiparticles ( or quasiholes ) over these states carry fractional charge and satisfy fractional statistics .    in the last few years",
    ", generalizations of these states have been under investigation . among these generalizations",
    "are so - called paired ( or more general , clustered ) quantum hall states . the notion of clustering will be explained in the next section . in the definition of these states ,",
    "parafermions play a predominant role . ultimately , it is the presence of these parafermions which cause the quasiholes to have peculiar statistics properties , namely , they obey ` non - abelian ' statistics ( see , for an early reference , @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest of the paired quantum hall states is the pfaffian state proposed by g.  moore and n.  read @xcite ; it is believed that this states describes the quantum hall effect at filling fraction @xmath4 .",
    "this quantum hall effect is special in the sense that it is the only quantum hall effect observed at a filling fraction with an _ even _ denominator ( in single layer samples ) @xcite .",
    "for a recent review on this subject , see @xcite .",
    "clustered analogues of the paired pfaffian state were proposed by n.  read and e.  rezayi ( rr ) @xcite .",
    "the states mentioned above are all spin - polarized ; spin - singlet analogues were proposed in @xcite .",
    "recently , the bosonic versions of the rr states were shown to be relevant in the context of rotating bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "the statistics properties of the parafermion fields will be investigated in this paper , with the intention of obtaining closed form expressions for the ground state degeneracy of clustered quantum hall states in the presence of quasihole excitations , as described in @xcite .",
    "this state counting problem is interesting for the following reasons .",
    "the clustered quantum hall states can be seen as ground states of a hamiltonian with an ( ultra local ) interaction between the electrons .",
    "finding the ground state degeneracy of this hamiltonian can be done in a conformal field theory ( cft ) approach , relying heavily on the statistics properties of the parafermionic fields .",
    "another approach is by numerically diagonalizing the interaction hamiltonian for a small number of electrons .",
    "this method can serve as a check on the analytical results of the first approach .",
    "thus , the quasihole degeneracies of a system of interacting electrons can be understood in terms of parafermionic statistics !    in the context of the the spin - polarized states of read and rezayi , the @xmath0 ( or @xmath5 ) parafermions are the relevant parafermions .",
    "for the ` non - abelian spin - singlet ' ( nass ) states of @xcite , the relevant parafermions are the parafermions related to @xmath1 ( see @xcite for a discussion on general parafermion cfts ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first recall in which way ( clustered ) quantum hall states can be constructed in cfts ( section [ construction ] ) . in section [ numerics ]",
    "we will shortly indicate the setup of numerical diagonalization studies , because we need to adapt the calculations to the setup in which these studies are done .",
    "the general structure of the counting formulas will be indicated in section [ countform ] .",
    "it will become clear that the degeneracy consists of an intrinsic and an orbital part , which need to be combined in the right way .",
    "the intrinsic degeneracy factors need to be split to make this possible .",
    "the remainder of the paper is devoted to this task , as no explicit expressions for these ` split degeneracies ' were known for general level @xmath6 for the states under consideration in this paper .",
    "we will explain the procedure to obtain these expressions using the @xmath7 parafermions of the nass state at level @xmath8 as an example ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the first step is to find a basis for the ( chiral ) spectrum of the parafermion cft . using this basis ,",
    "recursion relations for truncated characters will be derived ( section [ su32basis ] ) .",
    "these recursion relations can be solved using the results of section [ recrel ] , providing expressions for the truncated characters . from the explicit truncated characters , the ` split degeneracies ' can be extracted .",
    "finally the counting formula for the paired spin - singlet states is obtained in section [ nassk2 ] , filling in some of the details of the discussion in @xcite . in section [ rrcount ] , counting formulas for the rr states at general level @xmath9 are obtained , while section [ nasscount ] deals with the counting formulas for the general @xmath9 nass states .",
    "section [ discussion ] is devoted to discussions . in this paper",
    ", we do not go into the details of the numerical analysis , but refer to the papers @xcite .",
    "for all the cases checked , the results of the numerical diagonalization studies are exactly reproduced by the counting formulas .",
    "clustered quantum hall states are constructed as correlators in certain cfts . but before we come to this construction , let us first explain the nomenclature ` clustered states '",
    ". clustered states ( with order @xmath9 clustering ) have the following form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a bosonic factor ( symmetric under the exchange of any two coordinates ) with the property @xmath12 i.e. the wave function vanishes as soon as @xmath13 or more particles are at the same location .",
    "note that we omitted the exponential factors of the wave functions .",
    "the factor @xmath14 is the familiar laughlin factor .",
    "the fermionic quantum hall states all have @xmath3 odd , while the bosonic versions would have @xmath3 even .",
    "though changing @xmath3 changes many properties of the states , such as the filling fraction , the quasihole charge and statistics , the quasihole degeneracies are unaffected , and the counting formulas presented in this paper hold for any @xmath3 .",
    "note that this degeneracy is not to be confused with the ` torus degeneracy ' , which in fact does depend on @xmath3 .    following the pioneering paper @xcite , quantum hall states can , under certain restrictions , be defined as correlators in cfts . for the clustered quantum hall states , cfts with affine",
    "lie algebra symmetry are used .",
    "the operators creating the electrons in general consist of a parafermion field and a vertex operator of a set of @xmath15 chiral boson fields ( @xmath15 is the rank of the affine lie algebra ) .",
    "these boson fields take care of the charge , spin and possibly other quantum numbers associated to the particles .",
    "the electron creation operators take the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a parafermion field and @xmath18 is a set of free boson fields .",
    "the quantum hall states can be now be defined as follows @xmath19 the parameter @xmath20 in the background charge needs to be chosen in such a way that the overall correlator is charge neutral .",
    "@xmath21 is chosen such that the effect of the background charge does not go to zero in the limit @xmath22 , whilst keeping the result finite .",
    "moreover , the ( unique ) fusion of the parafermion fields @xmath23 must result in the identity operator @xmath24 in order to get a non - zero correlator .",
    "this in general puts a restriction on the number of electrons @xmath25 . in this paper",
    ", we will not give explicit results for the correlators ( and thereby the wave functions @xmath26 ) .",
    "these wave functions and other properties of the ground state , such as the filling fraction , can be found in @xcite for the read - rezayi states and in @xcite for the spin - singlet analogues proposed in @xcite .",
    "a different form of the read - rezayi wave functions can be found in @xcite .",
    "also , wave functions for states with quasiholes ( see below ) are presented there .",
    "states with excitations ( quasiholes ) present are also defined in terms of correlators in the same cft as the parent state , by inserting the corresponding quasihole operator in the correlator .",
    "certain properties of these quasiholes can be studied via the corresponding correlators .",
    "a constraint on these operators follows from the condition that the wave function has to be analytical in the electron coordinates ( the lowest landau level condition ) .",
    "this implies that the quasihole operators need to be _ local _ with respect to the electron operators .",
    "this constrains the quasihole operators to be of the following form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a ` spin field ' of the parafermion cft .",
    "note that the nomenclature spin field does not refer to the electron spin .",
    "again , one has to insert a background charge to enforce charge neutrality .",
    "also , upon fusing the parafermion and spin fields , one has to fuse to the identity operator @xmath24 in the last step , to obtain a non - zero correlator .",
    "this constrains the possible particles in the correlator .",
    "the fusion of the spin fields is not unique : in general there is more than one fusion channel .",
    "this implies that a correlator with several quasihole operators in general stands for more than one quantum hall state . in other words ,",
    "the clustered quantum hall states with quasiholes are degenerate .",
    "it is this degeneracy which lies at the heart of the non - abelian statistics .",
    "one immediate question one can ask is how many states does one describe with such correlators ?",
    "in fact , this question can be answered in two independent ways .",
    "the first one is via a numerical diagonalization study of interacting electrons on the sphere , in the presence of a magnetic field . in this paper",
    ", we will follow the second approach , which is analytical , and uses the conformal field theory of the underlying parafermions .",
    "but before we come to this point , we have to spend some words on the numerical approach as well , in order to be able to adapt the analytical approach to the numerical setup .",
    "this is the subject of the next section ; for a more details , we refer to @xcite .",
    "though we will not describe numerical diagonalization studies in depth in this paper , it is necessary to point out briefly in which setup they are done , because we need to adapt our calculations to be able to compare results .",
    "the numerical diagonalization is most easily done on the sphere .",
    "the interaction between the electrons is chosen such that the clustered state under investigation is the unique ground state ( in the absence of quasihole excitations ) .",
    "note that this interaction is an ultra local , many - body interaction , rather different from the long range coulomb interaction . to ` tune ' to the right filling fraction",
    ", a specific number of flux quanta need to penetrate the sphere .",
    "states with quasiholes can be studied by increasing the number of flux quanta ( but keeping all the other parameters the same ) ; this results in the creation of quasiholes , as can be seen from the laughlin gauge argument .",
    "the number of flux quanta needed for a state on the sphere with quasiholes is given by @xmath29 where @xmath25 is the total number of electrons , and @xmath30 the number of excess flux quanta , needed for the creation of the quasiholes .",
    "@xmath31 is an integer constant depending on the state under investigation . also , the number of quasiholes which are created by increasing the number of flux quanta by one depends on the state under investigation . for the spin - polarized rr states , this relation is given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the number of quasiholes .",
    "for the spin - singlet analogues , we have @xmath34 .    for the clustered quantum hall states with quasiholes present , the ground state is degenerate ( for the ultra local interaction ) .",
    "the degeneracy consists of two parts .",
    "first of all , there is an orbital degeneracy , which is caused by the fact that in this setup , the quasiholes are non - local .",
    "this orbital degeneracy is not specific for clustered states ; it is also present for the ( unpaired ) laughlin states . for a system in which the quasiholes are localized",
    ", this degeneracy would not be present .",
    "secondly , there is an intrinsic degeneracy , which stems from the non - trivial fusion rules of the spin fields , needed to create quasihole excitations .",
    "this source of degeneracy is special for the clustered states . in this paper , we will focus on this intrinsic degeneracy and obtain analytical expressions , which allow the combination with the orbital degeneracy factors .",
    "this provides us with explicit expressions for the degeneracy of the ground states , in the presence of quasiholes .",
    "as spin and angular momentum are good quantum numbers , all the states obtained from the numerical diagonalization fall into spin and angular momentum multiplets .",
    "the structure of the counting formulas is such that also the multiplet structure can be extracted .",
    "the intrinsic degeneracy is caused by the non - trivial fusion rules of the spin fields . as an example",
    ", we will use the spin fields of the @xmath7 parafermionic cft .",
    "the fields and their fusion rules in this theory can be determined according to the methods of @xcite and are summarized in table [ fusrul ] .",
    "we use the notation introduced in @xcite .",
    "the parafermion fields are denoted by @xmath23 , and all have conformal dimension @xmath35 . in particular , @xmath36,@xmath37,@xmath38 correspond to the roots @xmath39,@xmath40 and @xmath41 of @xmath42 , respectively .",

    "next to this intrinsic degeneracy , there is an orbital degeneracy .",

    "note that the results in this paper are easily extended to the more general @xmath68 parafermions",
    ".    we will now briefly outline in which way the split degeneracy factors are obtained .",
    "the starting point is the character of the parafermionic cft .",
    "the symbols @xmath64 can be extracted from finitized forms of these characters @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "recursion relations for these finitized characters can be derived from an explicit basis of the parafermionic cft .",
    "these recursion relations will be written in a way that allows for an explicit solution , from which the symbols @xmath64 can be extracted .",
    "in the sections [ su32basis]-[nassk2 ] , we will demonstrate this for the level @xmath8 spin - singlet states of @xcite .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe how an explicit basis for the chiral spectrum of the @xmath7 parafermion cft is formed .",
    "the starting point is the chiral character for the parafermions in the @xmath7 conformal field theory .",
    "this character can be written in the form of a ` universal chiral partition function ' ( ucpf ) see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "this character reads @xcite @xmath69 in this character , @xmath70 are fugacities of the particles , and @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is the inverse temperature ) .",
    "@xmath73 is defined by @xmath74 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the bilinear form in the exponent of @xmath77 is described by the matrix @xmath78 the same matrix also describes the exclusion statistics of these parafermions .",
    "more information on the relation between exclusion statistics and the ucpf can be found in @xcite .",
    "a basis for a cft can be thought of as a set of states spanning the chiral hilbert space .",
    "this set of states can be written as a ( set of ) vacuum state(s ) , on which creation operators act .",
    "the parafermions @xmath79 in the @xmath7 theory can be expanded in modes as @xmath80 as usual , the modes @xmath81 with negative index are the creation operators while the modes with positive index annihilate the vacuum @xmath82 the set of states @xmath83 is overcomplete , because of the ( generalized ) commutation rules of the parafermions . in the following , we will point out which restrictions on the indices @xmath84 will remove the ` overcompleteness ' . in doing so , we will follow the exclusion interpretation of the k - matrix as closely as possible and concentrate on the lowest possible ` energy ' ( given by @xmath85 ) for a certain number of applied fields first .",
    "the ordering of the modes @xmath86 is such that we apply the @xmath87 modes first . from it follows that the simplest non - trivial state is @xmath88 interpreting the matrix as the exclusion statistics matrix , the minimal spacing between two @xmath87 modes is @xmath89 , thus the state with two @xmath87 s acting on the vacuum with minimal energy is @xmath90 the extension to @xmath91 @xmath87 modes is simple @xmath92 note that if this were the whole story , we would describe the ( free ) majorana fermion .",
    "the spacing between @xmath93 modes is the same as for the @xmath87 modes .",
    "however , if one acts with @xmath93 on a state in which @xmath87 modes are already present , one has to take into account the mutual statistics between @xmath87 and @xmath93 modes , which is @xmath94 , according to .",
    "thus the energies of the @xmath93 modes have an extra shift of @xmath95 , resulting in the following states ( with minimal energy ) @xmath96 the ( dimensionless ) energy associated to this state is @xmath97 , precisely the exponent of @xmath77 in the character . to obtain all the possible states , one has to allow states with higher energies as well . as usual @xcite , the energies of all the modes can have integer shifts , under the restriction that modes acting on a state have larger energies than the modes of the same type which have been applied earlier .",
    "this results in the following set of states @xmath98 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) .    up to now , we used the special ordering of applying modes to the vacuum , namely , all the @xmath87 modes first .",
    "this is in fact enough to span the whole chiral spectrum , as can be seen if we perform the trace over all basis states .",
    "more or less by construction , we obtain the character . however , we also can allow a general ordering of the modes .",
    "as an example , we take the following state @xmath102 the energy of the @xmath93 mode is zero because it gets an extra shift of @xmath94 due to the presence of the @xmath87 mode . in spanning the whole chiral spectrum , we can also choose to use the state , with the order of the modes changed @xmath103 in this case , the @xmath87 mode gets an extra shift of @xmath94 , because of the presence of the @xmath93 mode .",
    "thus , the @xmath104 value is the same for both states . in general , changing the order of two neighbouring @xmath87 and @xmath93 modes does not change the @xmath104 value if the extra shifts are changed in the appropriate way .",
    "the extra shift of a field is given by @xmath94 times the number of preceding modes of the other type .",
    "in general , two states related by a reordering of modes are different , but we can use either of them ( but not both ) to span the chiral spectrum . note that the rules of the spacing between the various fields is in accordance with the ( exclusion ) statistics interpretation of the matrix @xmath105 .",
    "the character is obtained by taking the trace over all the states in the basis @xmath106 we can now define the finitized characters needed in the derivation of the symbols @xmath64 by using the basis described above .",
    "these finitized characters are polynomials which will be denoted by @xmath107 .",
    "these polynomials are traces over the basis , but restricted to the states in which the energy of the modes of the @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) fields are smaller or equal to @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) . though the total energy of a state does not depend on the ordering of the modes , the energies of the individual modes do depend on the ordering , as can be seen by comparing the states and . by restricting the trace over states in which the labels of the modes are bounded",
    ", we must include a state if there is at least one ordering in which all the modes satisfy the bounds imposed .",
    "note that there may be other orderings , in which these bounds are not satisfied .",
    "we write the finitized characters as @xmath110 the prime on the trace denotes an important restriction on the number of modes ( denoted by @xmath91 and @xmath111 ) present in the states .",
    "these numbers must satisfy @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "this restriction takes into account that after fusing the spin fields , one ends up in the right sector , which can be @xmath114 or @xmath38 depending on the number of spin - up and down electrons .",
    "this is necessary , because after fusing the spin fields and the parafermion fields of the electron operators , on has to end with the identity @xmath24 , to obtain a non - zero correlator .",
    "the finitized characters @xmath107 can be written in terms of recursion relations of the following form @xmath115 note that the recursion relations above are stated in terms of the energy labels of the modes .",
    "the aim we have is finding the number of possible states when a certain number of extra flux is added .",
    "we therefore need to make a change to labels which depend on the additional flux .",
    "in fact , we will use the number of particles ( given by @xmath54 and @xmath55 in this case ) created by this flux as labels for the finitized partition functions .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath116 and @xmath117 . in terms of the number of created quasiholes , the recursion relations become ( compare @xcite ) @xmath118 the initial conditions for these recursion relations look as follows @xmath119 the finitized characters are completely described by and . in the next section , we will solve these recursion relations and thereby provide explicit expressions for the finitized characters .",
    "the recursion relations of the previous section can be solved explicitly ; we will follow the approach of @xcite .",
    "the key observation is that the recursion relations can be matched to general recursion relations , which are solved in terms of finitizations of universal chiral partition functions . consider the following polynomials @xmath120 @xmath121}{0pt}{}{\\bigl({\\bf l } + ( { { \\mathbb i}}-{{\\mathbb k } } ) \\cdot { \\bf m } + { \\bf u } \\bigr)_i}{m_i } } \\ .\\ ] ] in this equation , @xmath122 is the identity matrix , @xmath105 the statistics matrix and @xmath123 $ ] the @xmath77-deformed binomial ( @xmath77-binomial ) @xmath124}{0pt}{}{a}{b } } =   \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{cc } \\frac{(q)_a}{(q)_b ( q)_{a - b } } & a , b \\in { { \\mathbb n}}\\ , ; \\ , b \\leq a \\\\ 0 & { \\rm otherwise } \\\\",

    "we will use the equivalence between and frequently , because the recursion relations we encounter in deriving the counting formulas are all of type .",
    "of course , upon deriving polynomials from recursion relations , one has to take the initial conditions into account . for the counting we need to know the finitizations of the character formulas , and",
    "these can be written in the form .",
    "thus , when we solve recursion relations by polynomials of the form , the proper initial conditions are automatically taken into account .",
    "we start by applying the above to the recursion relations , resulting in the following expressions for the truncated characters @xmath129 @xmath130}{0pt}{}{\\frac{n_\\uparrow+b}{2}}{a } } { \\genfrac{[}{]}{0pt}{}{\\frac{n_\\downarrow+a}{2}}{b } } \\ .\\ ] ] this result will be needed for the final counting formula , which we give in the next section .",
    "from the truncated characters of the previous section , we can obtain the symbols @xmath131 , needed in the counting formula eq . .",

    "this connection was first proposed in @xcite .",
    "some ( restricted ) ` solid on solid ' ( sos ) models ( see , for instance @xcite ) can be mapped to the bratteli diagrams of the spin fields of the quasiholes .",
    "recursion relations for the partition functions for these models ( at finite size ) are in general equivalent to recursion relations for finitized characters in certain cfts . in the case at hand ,",
    "the corresponding cft is the parafermion cft .",
