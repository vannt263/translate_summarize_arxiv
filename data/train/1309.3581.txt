    "the study of subluminal and superluminal propagation of light has been a focus of research in last few decades .",
    "a considerable work has been done to control slow and fast light by making use of quantum interference in multilevel atomic system coupled with several fields .",
    "harris _ et . al .",
    "_ @xcite suggested that electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite can be used to obtain group velocity much smaller than @xmath6 , the speed of light in vacuum . a number of impressive experiments @xcite has been performed on the group velocity of optical pulses .",
    "group velocities as low as 17 ms@xmath7 in a cloud of sodium atoms below the transition temperature for bose - einstein condensation @xcite and those of the order of 90 ms@xmath7 in optically dense hot rubidium gas @xcite have been reported .",
    "the laser pulses could also be stopped @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "superluminal propagation of optical pulses has been demonstrated by wang _ et .",
    "sommerfeld and brillouin @xcite theoretically showed that anomalous nature of dispersion profile may result in a group velocity faster than @xmath6 , thanks to the wave nature of light @xcite .",
    "an atomic medium can further be optically manipulated in a controlled fashion to switch from subluminal group velocities to the superluminal .",
    "such a control using a microwave field between two lower metastable states in a @xmath8-configuration was proposed by agarwal and coworkers @xcite .",
    "similar switching can be done by adjusting the relative phase of the weak probe fields applied to a v - type three - level system @xcite and the phase - difference between the strong control fields @xcite .",
    "tunability of group velocity in a v - system with indirect incoherent pumping has been further discussed in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the studies of coherence in systems with more than three energy levels @xcite have attracted much interest . among these",
    ", four - level systems with n - configuration may be specially mentioned , in which the power requirement of the control laser field is quite less , compared to that in the other configurations , to control group velocities of a probe field .",
    "it was proposed by harris in his seminal paper @xcite and later demonstrated in @xcite that a second control field in an eit system may lead to _ absorption of the probe field _ at resonance ( contrary to transparency , as in usual eit phenomenon ) , while it switches the dispersion from normal to anomalous .",
    "optical properties of rubidium in a doppler - broadened n - type configuration of @xmath9 transition have been discussed by chen _ et .",
    "salloum _ et . al .",
    "_ @xcite have explained the variations of dispersion and transparency of probe field in n - configuration with the help of various resonance terms .    in this paper , we consider a four - level configuration [ figure 1 ] as in @xmath0 transition for @xmath1 lines in alkali atoms @xcite , which can be understood as a combination of two n - configurations , each with a single circularly polarized control field in action .",
    "we show the possibility of switching the propagation from subluminal to superluminal domain , along with zero absorption , by tuning the strength of a _ single _ resonant linearly polarized control field . a very large group index(@xmath10 3.2@xmath2 )",
    "can be obtained which results in ultraslow light .",
    "note that in @xcite , a similar switching has been reported in a different four - level configuration that requires _ two _ control fields , unlike in the present case .",
    "we emphasize that in the present system , the control field does not lead to probe absorption , as opposed to that reported in the previous studies of n - systems .",
    "therefore , this configuration can be considered as a preferable candidate to obtain sharp tunability of group velocity .",
    "the polarization components of control field in two transitions dress the system . for a particular set of these components of control field ,",
    "the transition from the excited dressed state manifold to the ground state manifold create a gain doublet , which results in superluminality . for a different set of control field components , the absorption from the ground state doublet dominates over the gain , and results in subluminality .",
    "we further emphasize that the power of the control field can be kept much lower ( of the order of @xmath11mw/@xmath4 ) than those reported in the early experiments on group velocity manipulation , while maintaining the tunability of group velocities .",
    "this is the first time , the possibility of changing dispersion from normal to anomalous and _ then back to normal _ and thereby of producing a valley of anomalous dispersion using such a low power control field is proposed .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the atomic configuration along with relevant density matrix equations .",
    "we also propose a possible experimental set - up to achieve such configuration . in section 3",
    ", we provide the exact analytical solution of these equations , up to first order of the probe field .",
    "we here describe how the group index can be made tunable with respect to the control field strength .",

    "the spin of @xmath32k nucleus can be ignored for theoretical simplifications @xcite , so that 4s@xmath30 and 4p@xmath30 states consist of two degenerate zeeman sublevels with magnetic quantum numbers @xmath33 .",
    "the transitions @xmath19 and @xmath34 are driven simultaneously by a weak linearly polarized electromagnetic field @xmath35c.c .. the rabi frequency for this probe field is given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the electric dipole moment matrix element between the levels @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "it should be borne in mind that in the previous studies on n - systems @xcite , only one atomic transition is driven by the probe field , while both the control fields share a common ground state .",
    "this is unlike the system in this paper , in which the control field do not share any of the atomic states .",
    "a possible experimental setup for this configuration @xcite is shown in figure 2 .",
    "note that the configuration of figure 1 could also be understood as a combination of two @xmath8-systems , each of which is composed of one control field and one of the probe field , with degenerate excited state and ground state manifold .",

    "the above equations are obtained by using rotating wave approximation so as to neglect the highly oscillating terms .",
    "the transformations for the density matrix elements are as follows : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "the rest of the elements remain the same .    to solve ( [ eq2 ] ) in steady state",
    ", we expand the density matrix elements in fourier domain in terms of @xmath71 as    @xmath72    comparing the coefficients of @xmath73 , we obtain a set of linear algebraic equations for @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "we solve these equations for different values of @xmath76 , as described in the next section .",

    "are shown in figure 3 . for resonant control field ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath99 , the dispersion profile becomes anti - symmetric and the absorption profile becomes symmetric around @xmath100 .",
    "when @xmath101 ( that corresponds to a power of 0.415 mw/@xmath4 , in case of d@xmath29 transition in @xmath98k and @xmath102 mhz ) , the absorption is zero and dispersion has a positive slope [ figure 3(a ) ] .",
    "the absorption spectrum continues to exhibit two peaks as in the case of eit until @xmath103 ( corresponding to a power of 1.66 mw/@xmath5 ) .",
    "the separation between these two peaks increases with @xmath104 and hence the slope of dispersion profile decreases as shown in figure 3(b ) .",
    "but at @xmath105 ( 3.37 mw/@xmath5 ) , the slope of dispersion becomes zero at zero probe detuning , as shown in figure 3(c ) . with further increase in the control field strength to @xmath106 ( 6.64 mw/@xmath5 ) ,",
    "the slope of the dispersion profile becomes negative , while the absorption remains zero near probe field resonance , as shown in figure 3(d ) .",
    "note that the absorption profile for @xmath107 is similar to mollow spectrum in a driven two - level system but the dispersion profile behaves in a distinct way , compared to such a system .",
    "we have found that for larger @xmath104 , this slope remains negative , along with zero absorption @xcite .",
    "the physical explanation of the zero absorption and gain peaks has been provided in section 4 .",
    "we emphasize that the change in slope from positive to negative is a combined effect of both the circular components of the control field .",
    "if one of the circular component of the control field could be switched off , the slope would remain positive as in eit .",
    "as the slope of dispersion profile changes from normal to anomalous , there is a corresponding switching of group velocity of the probe field from the subluminal domain to the superluminal , at the resonance . the group index @xmath108 is related to the group velocity @xmath109 through the following relation : @xmath110^{-1}\\ ; , \\label{eq11}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the velocity of light in vacuum and @xmath111 is the frequency of the probe field .",
    "thus by modifying the group index , group velocity can be made subluminal ( @xmath112 , or @xmath113 ) , superluminal ( @xmath114 , or @xmath115 ) or even negative ( @xmath116 , or @xmath117 ) .",
    "when re@xmath80 is negligible , then the slope of the dispersion profile at resonance plays a major role in the determination of group index and group velocity .",
    "note that the real part of @xmath118 is zero at probe resonance , as shown in figure 3 . in figure 4 , we show the variation of @xmath108 with @xmath119 for @xmath99 . clearly , the group index changes from a large positive value to a large negative value as the strength of the control field is varied .",
    "it is positive for @xmath120 , zero at @xmath105 , and becomes negative for @xmath121 .",
    "the variation of group index for @xmath120 is shown in the insets ( a ) and ( b ) in figure 4 .",
    "the group index of the order of @xmath122 for coupling power of @xmath123mw/@xmath4 is reported in @xcite .",
    "but in our model , for smaller value of @xmath104(@xmath124 0.1@xmath93 @xmath1240.017 mw/@xmath4 ) , group index can be as large as 3.2 @xmath2 .",
    "further , the @xmath108 attains the largest negative value @xmath125 at @xmath126 ( 9.56 mw/@xmath5 ) .",
    "we further consider the situation when @xmath128 that can be achieved by using a variable neutral density filter ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "we have solved the density matrix equations analytically ( see appendix a for the solutions ) for @xmath129 in this case .",
    "we show in figure 5 the variation of @xmath108 with @xmath130 for a particular value of @xmath131 .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath132 , @xmath108 remains positive for all values of @xmath130 .",
    "but for @xmath133 , @xmath108 first switches from positive values to the negative and then from negative values to the positive , as @xmath130 is further increased .",
    "this suggests that for @xmath133 , the group velocity of the probe field switches from subluminal to superluminal and again to subluminal , as rabi frequency @xmath134 of the control field component is increased .",
    "we thus obtain a  valley of anomaly \" , in which the dispersion remains anomalous and the group index remains negative .",
    "this demonstrates a _",
    "better coherent control _ over group velocity , all for small values of the strength of the control field . in figure 6 , we show the variation of @xmath108 with @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "the region of largest superluminality appears around @xmath135 .",
    "we also obtain the largest subluminality at @xmath136 ( region not shown ) .",
    "in addition , we can have two sets of values of control field components , for example , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , at which the absorption in the medium is zero and @xmath139 . in these cases",
    ", the system clearly appears as vacuum to the probe pulses .",
    "with respect to @xmath130 and @xmath131 with the parameters same as in figure 4 . ]      to confirm these results , we next study the propagation of a gaussian pulse with a normalized envelope given by @xmath140 } ; & \\varepsilon(t)=\\varepsilon_{0}\\exp{\\left(-\\sigma^{2}t^{2}/4\\right ) } \\end{array } \\label{eq12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath12 gives the width of the pulse in frequency domain .",
    "the unwanted absorption ( gain ) of different frequency components of the pulse can be avoided by choosing a narrow - band pulse , so that it remains well within the eit window ( gain doublet ) . for numerical calculation ,",
    "we choose @xmath141 khz . in figure 7",
    ", we show the numerical results of the pulse ( [ eq12 ] ) at the output of the medium for several values of @xmath104 .",
    "the pulse delay of 30 @xmath142 for @xmath104 = @xmath93 is shown in figure 7(a ) .",
    "the group index calculated from the delay between the reference pulse and the output pulse is in good agreement , with the value of the group index ( @xmath108 = 9.8@xmath14310@xmath144 ) as shown in figure 4 , for @xmath104 = @xmath93 .",
    "figure 7(b ) shows that medium behaves like vacuum ( @xmath108 = 1 ) for the input pulse , as the relative delay between the reference pulse and the output pulse vanishes as predicted in figure 4 for @xmath104 = 1.5@xmath93 .",
    "the pulse advancement of -4.71 @xmath142 at @xmath104 = 2@xmath93 is demonstrated in figure 7(c ) and it corresponds to a group index of -1.4@xmath14310@xmath144 , which also agrees well with the figure 4 at @xmath104 = 2@xmath93 .",
    "in a driven two level system @xcite , the probe field propagates through an anomalously dispersive medium without any absorption at probe resonance . this can be understood in terms of the states , partially dressed by the strong field .",
    "the transition dipole moment matrix elements among these dressed states cancel each other , to nullify the absorption of the probe field .",
    "similarly , in a three level system with @xmath8 configuration , a strong control field makes the system transparent to a weak probe field , thanks to eit , which is associated to normal dispersion . the total transition amplitude from the ground state to the partially dressed states vanishes , leading to the zero absorption for the probe field . in this paper , we deal with a driven four - level system , where the absorption remains zero at probe resonance .",
    "this also can be understood in terms of the partial dressed states , arising due to the resonant control fields , which are given by @xmath145 with the respective eigen energies @xmath146 .",
    "the absorption probability of the probe fields in the transitions @xmath147 and @xmath148 is proportional to the square of the total transition amplitude",
    ". this transition amplitude will be the sum of those in the transitions @xmath149 as given by @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the dipole moment operator . as the transition between level @xmath152 to @xmath153 is dipole forbidden ,",
    "@xmath154 is zero .",
    "thus the total transition amplitude and hence the absorption vanishes at probe resonance .    to understand the physics behind the tunability of group velocity , let us consider the absorption of the probe field in the @xmath155 transition .",
    "when the @xmath156 field is on , the absorption profile gets split into two peaks , corresponding to the transitions @xmath157 . in this case , at resonance , the absorption probability of the probe photon gets nullified with the gain probability from the dressed states @xmath158 ( note that the state @xmath26 is also initially populated ) .",
    "we obtain a classic case of eit , leading to normal dispersion at resonance .",
    "if the @xmath134 field is now switched on , some of the population from the state @xmath25 is pumped to @xmath26 via @xmath28 , and it thus increases the gain probability .",
    "if @xmath134 is increased beyond certain threshold value , the gain of the probe field dominates over the absorption in the @xmath147 transition , at near - resonance domain .",
    "the gain is nullified at resonance , that generates two gain peaks .",
    "we thus obtain a gain doublet that is associated with anomalous dispersion @xcite .",
    "note that the total susceptibility of the medium is a sum over those in the two probe transitions ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "therefore , for much larger values of @xmath134 ( keeping @xmath156 constant ) , the system starts to behave like an eit system , with reference to the probe field in the @xmath148 transition .",
    "this again provides two absorption peaks , associated with normal dispersion at resonance . in this way , by adjusting the amplitude of the two polarization components of the control field , one can switch the dispersion from normal to anomalous and then back to normal .",
    "it may be noted that for @xmath159 , the absorption peaks becomes far apart ( separation between them is of the order of @xmath160 ) , and the slope of the susceptibility also tends to vanish .",
    "this explains why @xmath108 tends to unity for large @xmath134 , as shown in figure 5 .",
    "+     +    further , as shown in the appendix a , the probe coherence @xmath77 is a sum of three zeroth - order contributions : population - difference term @xmath161 ( proportional to @xmath162 ) and coherence terms @xmath163 ( proportional to @xmath164 ) and @xmath165 ( proportional to @xmath166 ) . in figure 8",
    ", we show the individual contributions of these terms in the absorption spectra . at two photon resonance ( @xmath167 ) , the contributions from two terms @xmath161 and @xmath163 to the absorption spectra for @xmath77 cancel each other , while the other coherence term @xmath165 remains zero for @xmath83 [ figure 8(a ) ] , leading to no absorption . when @xmath168 , the transparency at two photon resonance is caused by all the coherence terms @xmath163 and @xmath165 , as well as the term @xmath161 [ figure 8(b ) ] .",
    "the gain in certain frequency domain can be further understood in terms of competing effect of the coherence terms and population difference terms . as shown in figure 8(c ) , the negative contributions from @xmath163 and @xmath165 are larger in magnitude than the positive contribution from @xmath161 at around @xmath169 .",
    "thus we obtain a situation where a gain - doublet and therefore a window of anomalous dispersion is generated by control - field - induced coherence .",
    "the doppler broadening for the copropagating control and probe fields can be accounted by replacing @xmath170 by ( @xmath171 ) and @xmath172 by ( @xmath173 ) , where , @xmath174 is the velocity of an atom .",
    "as the pump and probe field are copropagating , the two - photon resonance condition remains unaffected by the doppler broadening , as the velocity - dependent detunings @xmath175 and @xmath176 maintains the relation @xmath177 .",
    "the susceptibility ( [ eq5 ] ) is averaged over the maxwell - boltzmann distribution of velocities at a temperature @xmath178 @xmath179},\\ ] ] here @xmath180 is the doppler width defined by @xmath181 @xmath182 is the boltzmann constant and m is the mass of an atom . the doppler - averaged susceptibility can be written as @xmath183 the group index in such a medium takes the following form : @xmath184 + 2\\pi \\omega_{p } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\omega_p}\\mbox{re}\\left[\\langle \\chi_{\\pi}(\\omega_p)\\rangle\\right].\\ ] ]     +    we show in figure 9 , the numerical results for the real and imaginary parts of @xmath185 for resonant control field .",
    "we choose doppler width @xmath180 = 324@xmath93 at room temperature .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath185 still remain zero at probe resonance , whereas the slope of the real part changes from normal to anomalous by increasing the strength of the control field . in figure 10 , we show the numerical results for the behavior of @xmath186 as a function of @xmath104 , for resonant probe field . in doppler broadened medium , the switching from subluminal to superluminal group velocity is still seen to occur but at @xmath104 = 5.18@xmath93 .     in doppler broadened medium with @xmath119 .",
    "insets ( a ) and ( b ) shows the variation of @xmath186 for 1@xmath1873.5 and 3.6@xmath1875.18 , respectively .",
    "other parameters are same as in figure 9 . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have discussed the possibility of tunable group velocity in @xmath0 transition in alkali atoms , driven by a single linearly polarized resonant control field .",
    "we find that the group velocity of a linearly polarized probe field can be switched from positive ( subluminal propagation ) to negative ( superluminal propagation ) by changing the strength of the control field . by suitably manipulating the values of @xmath134 ( @xmath156 ) , one also can obtain a range of @xmath156 ( @xmath134 ) , where the superluminality persists .",
    "we refer to this range as a  valley of anomaly \" , in which the probe absorption remains zero .",
    "we demonstrate , using detailed analytical and numerical results , that by keeping the power of the circular components of control field at low values , one can scan over a large range of group index ( from @xmath188 to @xmath189 ) .",
    "we provide detailed physical explanation of the gain and transparency in terms of coherence , created by the control field components .",
    "we further show how a gaussian pulse propagates through such a medium and attains different group velocities at different control fields .",
    "we provide detailed numerical analysis for the group index variation by considering the doppler broadening at room temperature .",
    "we also have proposed a possible experimental set - up to demonstrate our results .",
    "it must be noted that the effect of hyperfine structure in alkali atoms can not be neglected .",
    "for example , in @xmath98k the hyperfine splitting of the @xmath190 state is 55.5 mhz and of the @xmath191 state is 461.7 mhz , leading to non - degenerate excited and ground state manifolds .",
    "one could use the @xmath192 and @xmath193 as relevant levels in both the manifolds .",
    "such highest order magnetic hyperfine sublevels can be populated by using optical pumping , as routinely done in cold atom experiments . however ,",
    "if the probe field is kept near - resonant to one of the @xmath194 transition , it will remain highly off - resonant in the other @xmath194 transition .",
