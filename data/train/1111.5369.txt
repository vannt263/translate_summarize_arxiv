    "the study of the fluctuating heat interchange between a small system and a thermal reservoir is of academic interest but also of direct experimental relevance , as new techniques for microscopic manipulation and detection allow nowadays to measure fluctuations in small experimental systems of relevance in physics , chemistry and biology  @xcite . at this respect ,",
    "a group of relations known as fluctuation theorems ( ft )  @xcite have attracted a lot of attention as they shed a new light into the principles governing energy fluctuations in a family of model systems .",
    "remarkably , these results go beyond linear - response or quasi - equilibrium conditions , and apply to systems driven by non - conservative forces with arbitrary time - dependent protocols , even feedback controlled @xcite .",
    "formally , the generality of the fts can be attributed to the way probability distribution functions of particular observables behave under symmetry - breaking forcings , such as non - conservative and/or time dependent forces ( see  @xcite for reviews on ft ) .",
    "although the fts are not expected to hold for every experimental system in contact with a thermal bath , they still provide a nice framework to analyse and understand the fluctuating heat interchange of out of equilibrium systems in general . here",
    "we focus , as in most of the recent works in this field , on the family of systems whose driven dynamics can be well described by langevin equations ( without memory ) or by discrete markov chains .",
    "these are the prototypical models for which most fts can be proven easily , without making any additional assumptions .",
    "( note that fluctuation theorems have also been derived for non - markovian dynamics  @xcite . )",
    "fts are exact relations for the probability distributions for the values @xmath0 of observables @xmath1 $ ] which are functionals of the stochastic state - space system trajectories @xmath2 ( _ e.g. _ work , heat or more generally , different forms of trajectory - dependent entropy productions ) in processes driven by an arbitrary time - dependent protocol @xmath3 during a time @xmath4 . typically , the so - called integral fluctuation theorems ( ifts ) are exact relations for the thermal average over histories such as @xmath5 while detailed fluctuations theorems ( dfts ) for the same observable are stronger relations , typically of the form @xmath6 , involving the probability distributions @xmath7-w)\\rangle$ ] and @xmath8-w)\\rangle^t$ ] of the stochastic values @xmath0 of @xmath9 , with @xmath10 denoting that the trajectories @xmath11 are sampled from a transformed ( typically time - reversed ) dynamics such that @xmath12 .",
    "the observable @xmath9 is thus convenient to measure the asymmetry under the transformation @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the kullback - leibler distance between two distributions @xmath15 and @xmath16 . prominent examples for physically relevant observables @xmath9 are the total entropy production @xmath17 which yields the jarzynski ift @xcite and crooks dft @xcite , the non - adiabatic entropy @xmath18 produced in transitions between non - equilibrium steady - states yielding the hatano - sasa ift @xcite and dft @xcite , and the adiabatic entropy production @xmath19 , yielding the speck - seifert ift @xcite and dft @xcite .",
    "a simple unifying picture for all these seemingly different fts has emerged recently @xcite .",
    "although a dft trivially includes as a particular case an ift it is now clear that there exist two basic operations @xmath10 that we can use for generating the dft version corresponding to each of the above mentioned ifts .",
    "these two operations are _ time - reversal _",
    "( @xmath20 ) , which reverses the protocol maintaining the form of the dynamical equations , and the transformation to the so - called _ dual dynamics _ ( @xmath21 ) , which corresponds to different dynamical equations .",
    "these transformations are interesting since they are closely related to symmetry operations of equilibrium and non - equilibrium steady - states .",
    "the above mentioned fts can indeed be all unified in three detailed fluctuation theorems @xcite satisfied by the the total entropy production @xmath17 , and by each term of its particular two - fold decomposition , @xmath22 , into an adiabatic @xmath19 and a non - adiabatic part @xmath18 .",
    "this splitting is physically motivated and closely related , for isothermal processes , to the splitting @xmath23 of the total work done by all forces , into a house - keeping heat @xmath24 and an excess heat @xmath25 , proposed by oono and paniconi @xcite and later formalised by hatano - sasa  @xcite for describing steady - state thermodynamics .",
    "the three dft read @xmath26 where in the second equation the dual and the the time - reversal operations are composed .",
    "as we can see , at variance with the dft for @xmath17 , where the distribution of @xmath17 for the forward process is compared with the one for the backward process obeying a time - reversed protocol , the detailed fluctuations theorems for @xmath19 and @xmath18 require comparing the forward process with a process governed by the adjoint dynamics ( which can be additionally time - reversed ) , which is very different from the original physical dynamics and therefore difficult to impose experimentally in general .    in a recent paper",
    "we have shown that writing detailed theorems in terms of joint probabilities is a convenient approach for deriving easily a family of relations , including the three detailed fts , which might prove relevant for diverse applications .",
    "introducing joint distributions is on the other hand natural when we are interested in the path dependent fluctuations of non - scalar observables .",
    "indeed more general transformations @xmath10 such as vector rotations  @xcite can be also considered for deriving joint - distributions fts . in this work",
    "we provide more detailed calculations and expand the results of  @xcite , and then propose new applications .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : rev ] we review various fts and introduce the notations and basic observables used in the next sections . in section  [ sec : ftjoint ] we review the main results of our previous work , and give their detailed derivation using langevin dynamics in its path - integral ( onsager - machlup ) representation ( paragraph  [ ssec : langevin ] ) and markov chains ( paragraph  [ ssec : markov ] ) . in section  [ sec : appli ]",
    "we discuss some applications of our results .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are gathered in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "it is clear that given two different dynamical weights @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 $ ] for the stochastic trajectories @xmath29 of a given system , we can always define a trajectory dependent quantity @xmath30=\\ln(\\mathcal{p}[{\\bf x } ; \\sigma]/{\\mathcal{p}^t}[{\\bf x } ; \\sigma]).\\ ] ] which satisfies , by construction , the symmetry relation @xmath31 \\rangle_{p_0 } =   \\langle \\mathcal{o}[{\\bf x } ; \\sigma ] e^{{\\mathcal w}[{\\bf x};\\sigma]}\\rangle^{t}_{p_1 } ,   \\label{eq : dftgeneral}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 ... $ ] , @xmath33 ... $ ] , with initial conditions sampled from the arbitrary distributions @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "the functional @xmath36 $ ] is an arbitrary observable and thus equation ( [ eq : dftgeneral ] ) can be used to get a detailed statistics .",
    "@xmath9 is by construction odd under the swapping of the two dynamics , and its average over the first dynamics is the kullback - leiber distance between the two trajectory ensembles @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 $ ] , that is @xmath37\\parallel{\\mathcal{p}^t}[{\\bf x } ; \\sigma])$ ] .",
    "one may use the general equation ( [ eq : dftgeneral ] ) in two interesting ways :    * * mapping trajectory ensembles : * on one hand we might directly choose two different dynamics ( through their transition probabilities or through their langevin equations for instance ) and use the equation to compare them quantitatively and from a purely information theoretical point of view . at this respect",
    "it is worth noting equation ( [ eq : dftgeneral ] ) `` maps '' averages of arbitrary observables @xmath38 in the original trajectory ensemble to another average in a `` target ensemble '' of trajectories .",
    "an interesting case is the one which maps averages in a true non - equilibrium ensemble where detailed balance is broken ( e.g. driven by non - conservative forces ) to a one satisfying detailed balance ( e.g. driven by potential forces ) .",
    "a particular instance where @xmath9 does acquires also a clear physical meaning is the mapping to equilibrium dynamics that is discussed in section  [ mappingtoeq ] . * * symmetry transformations and entropy production : * on the other hand , instead of choosing a `` target '' dynamics , we might focus on the properties of the original dynamics and directly choose transformations @xmath10 of it connected to symmetries of their equilibrium and non - equilibrium steady - states ( ness ) .",
    "as it is well known and we briefly review in the next sections , what make this case specially interesting is that for such special transformations usually @xmath9 acquires a well defined physical meaning as generalised trajectory entropy productions . as we show in the following sections , time - reversal and the transformation to the so called `` dual '' dynamics yield the three detailed theorems of ( [ eq : esposito3dft ] ) and thus many known fluctuations theorems of great relevance in stochastic thermodynamics .      in the _ time - reversed _ dynamics , @xmath39 ,",
    "trajectories are still governed by the original dynamical equations , with a time - reversed protocol @xmath40 . when a system is driven out of equilibrium , either by non - conservative or time dependent forces ,",
    "the resulting asymmetry is _",
    "e.g. _ measured by comparing the statistical weights of two `` twin trajectories ''  @xcite @xmath41 and @xmath42 such that their components are related as @xmath43 , that is @xmath41 is evolved with @xmath3 and and @xmath42 with @xmath44 .",
    "a convenient measure between the two weights is the functional @xmath45=\\ln(\\mathcal{p}[{\\bf x } ; \\sigma]/\\mathcal{p}^r[{\\bf x}^r ; \\sigma^r]),\\ ] ] defined from the statistical weight @xmath46 $ ] of system trajectories @xmath41 evolved , starting from an initial condition distribution @xmath47 = p_0(s)$ ] , during a given time interval @xmath4 in a @xmath48-dimensional state space under the action of forces controlled by an arbitrary set @xmath49 of time - dependent external parameters  @xcite .",
    "here @xmath50 $ ] denotes the statistical weight of the trajectory @xmath41 but evolved backwards , @xmath51 , and with the backward protocol @xmath52 , sampled from an initial condition distribution @xmath53 = p_1(s)$ ] .",
    "for instance , for a langevin dynamics we typically have @xmath54\\sim e^{-\\int_0^\\tau    dt\\;\\mathcal{l}[x,\\dot x;\\sigma]+\\ln p_0(x(0))}$ ] , and @xmath55 \\sim e^{-\\int_0^\\tau dt\\;\\mathcal{l}[x^r,\\dot x^r;\\sigma^r]+\\ln    p_1(x^r(0))}$ ] , where @xmath56 $ ] is the dynamical action of the system which , in general , also contains the logarithm of a jacobian , whose form depends on the considered stochastic calculus . by making a simple change of variables",
    ", we easily derive @xmath57\\sim -\\int_0^\\tau dt\\;(\\mathcal{l}[x,\\dot x;\\sigma]-\\mathcal{l}[x,-\\dot x;\\sigma])-\\ln ( p_0(x(0))/p_1(x(\\tau)))$ ] ( see section  [ ssec : langevin ] ) . from we",
    "have , by construction , that @xmath58 is odd under @xmath59 , that is , @xmath60=-{\\mathcal s}[{\\bf x } ; \\sigma]$ ] , since @xmath20 is an involution .",
    "we also note that the definition of @xmath58 allows us to write , for the average of any observable @xmath61 $ ] @xmath62\\rangle = \\langle \\mathcal{o}[{\\bf x}^r ; \\sigma ] e^{-s[{\\bf x};\\sigma^r ] }   \\rangle^r,\\ ] ] where @xmath63 ... $ ] and @xmath64 ... $ ] denotes the average over forward and reversed trajectories respectively .",
    "we note also that the concept of twin trajectories used to define @xmath58 is irrelevant in the last equation since on each side we integrate over all possible trajectories ( i.e. @xmath41 is now a dummy variable ) and that @xmath65 since @xmath66 is simply a time reflection and shift of the trajectory @xmath41 in time - state space .",

    "since the equality above is thus reached for time - reversal symmetric processes , at equilibrium @xmath78 , as expected .",
    "it is easy to show that such symmetry is actually stronger , @xmath79 , due to detailed balance . in addition",
    ", if the relaxation time of the equilibrium states is finite , then processes that are driven very slowly compared with it do not produce this quantity either , as the adiabatic process makes the system visit a sequence of the ( symmetric ) equilibrium states compatible with the instantaneous value @xmath3 .",
    "it is also worth remarking here that all the above statistical properties are valid for arbitrary protocols @xmath3 , arbitrary initial conditions for the forward @xmath80 and backward @xmath81 process , and they are time - independent , that is , they are valid for any @xmath82 .",
    "let us note however that our definition of @xmath58 includes a border term containing information about the initial condition , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , of the twin processes it compares .",
    "we note also that the choice of @xmath81 is free , and not a constraint for the trajectories at the border @xmath83 however , a direct connection with `` physical '' entropy production @xmath17 can be done if one chooses @xmath81 being the solution of the fokker - planck ( or master ) equation at time @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "what makes @xmath58 physically interesting in connection with stochastic thermodynamics is that it can be identified , up to a time border term , with the stochastic heat dissipated into the reservoir divided by its temperature along the stochastic system trajectory @xmath11 , for an isothermal process .",
    "if such process is described for instance by a langevin dynamics @xmath84 , where the force @xmath85 might contain both conservative and non - conservative terms , it can be shown that  @xcite ( see paragraphs  [ ssec : langevin ] and  [ ssec : markov ] for the derivation in langevin dynamics and markov chains situations respectively ) , @xmath86&= & \\frac{1}{t}\\int_0^\\tau dt\\;f(x;\\sigma ) \\dot{x }   + \\ln \\frac{p_0(x(0))}{p_1(x(\\tau ) ) } \\\\ & = & \\frac{{q^{\\tt tot}}[{\\bf x};\\sigma]}{t } + \\ln \\frac{p_0(x(0))}{p_1(x(\\tau))}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functional of the trajectory @xmath87 $ ] is the total work done by the force @xmath85 on the stochastic trajectory @xmath11 under the protocol @xmath88 , and the border term @xmath89 $ ] depends only on the time boundaries of each stochastic trajectory , sampled by @xmath80 and @xmath81 which remain so far arbitrary . with this identification of @xmath58 , it is also interesting to note again that since @xmath90||\\mathcal{p}^r[{\\bf x}^r ; \\sigma^{\\text{r}}])$ ] ,",
    "( [ jensen_total ] ) and  ( [ kurchan ] ) relate irreversibility and dissipation in an elegant information theoretical way . at this respect",

    "this has led oono and paniconi  @xcite to introduce a useful two fold decomposition of the total heat exchange into a `` house - keeping heat '' part , constantly produced to maintain the non - equilibrium driven steady - state with non - vanishing currents , and an `` excess heat '' part , produced only during transitions between steady - states .",
    "the excess heat is minimised in adiabatic processes , that is when @xmath3 varies very slowly compared with an assumed finite relaxation time towards the ness , while the house keeping heat is minimised only at equilibrium , in the absence of non - conservative forces , when detailed balance is recovered .",

    "let us now introduce the notations @xmath421 and @xmath422 .",
    "then , one can rewrite the two previous equations as @xmath423 with @xmath424 then , equation ( [ fdt11 ] ) corresponds to the symmetry upon indices interchange : @xmath425",
    "we have reviewed , for continuum and discrete systems following a markovian dynamics , how symmetries of the dynamical entropy translate into detailed or integrated fluctuation theorems , in terms of the symmetries under particular transformations of joint probability distributions .    from a conceptual point of view",
    ", the fts given in ( [ jointprobs ] ) provide a convenient perspective to understand the interplay between different contributions to the total entropy production .",
    "the first of these equalities shows an explicit relation between the entropy production fluctuations associated to the system and its environment , valid at finite time and without quasi - static assumption .",
    "it allows one to study the correlations between the two sources of entropy production .",
    "the second relation unifies the three detailed fts derived in  @xcite .",
    "the relevance of this expression is twofold .",
    "first , it implies the previously known fts , and secondly , it gives a relation between the fluctuations of these two different entropy productions without relying on the dual dynamics ( which is useful from an experimental point of view since one does not need to run a second system with the dual dynamics ) . in practice , to compute the contributions to the total entropy production , one needs to measure the ratios between transition rates , the pdf of the system at initial and final times , and the pdf in the steady - state  which is achievable ( see  @xcite where ratios between transitions rates have been measured ) . in the case of continuous langevin equations ,",
    "only the pdfs have to be measured . in any case ,",
    "( [ jointprobs ] ) is thus of experimental use .",
    "it is known that fluctuation theorems provide a non - equilibrium way to measure physically relevant properties of single molecules ( such as conformational free energy differences , see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "we have proposed two other outcomes : a way to estimate experimental errors due to fluctuations in measurement apparatus and a modified non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation ( fdr)(see also  @xcite ) .    in the first case",
    ", we have studied the experimental measurements of , for example , the hatano - sasa functional .",
    "we have demonstrated that the joint pdf of the experimentally measured values and the error of each measurement satisfies a ft , which allow to extract precise information about the influence of error sources on the results .",
    "in particular we have obtained an exact expression for the `` violation factor '' of the hatano - sasa ift in the simple case considered in the experiment of trepagnier _ et al _",
    "it is worth noting that our results are compatible with the experimental measurements .",
    "we have explicitly obtained that for protocols with higher dissipation the experimental results are farther from the expected ones than those of protocols with lower dissipation .",
    "this fact is observed in the broadening of errors bars as dissipation increases .",
    "using the same ideas , one can study some other family of interesting systems : those with feedback , where the external protocol imposed to the system depends on the outcome of some measurement which can be carried out with some error .    in the second case",
    ", we have obtained new symmetries for correlation functions linked to modified fdrs .",
    "those symmetries are based on the use of weighted averages which introduce some bias in the system such that , controlling this weight , one forces the system to prefer some trajectories in the phase space .",
    "we have indeed shown that , for a particular form of this weight , the dynamics of the system is exactly mapped to the dynamics of some equivalent equilibrium system , giving a physical meaning to these symmetries .",
    "although the result looks artificial , it can be reformulated in terms of generalised forces and currents , giving the possibility to recover onsager reciprocity in the linear regime in the vicinity of a ness @xcite .",
    "last , let us note that joint pdfs - fts can be relevant in other contexts .",
    "consider for example a set of strongly connected systems which do not satisfy a ft for any of the entropic contributions of its constituents . in this case , the most precise information one can obtain involves contributions from all the subsystems .",
    "this can be seen in classical systems but also in quantum situations .",
    "for example , some recent modified fts have been obtained for counting - statistics of electron transport in quantum dots , coupled to quantum point contacts which play the role of measurements apparatus continuously monitoring the system ( see for example  @xcite for recent developments and a discussion on the effects of the back action of the environment on the system ) .",
    "an extension of our procedure to quantum systems may also give some general framework to tackle such problems .",
