    "2002 ) , implying a largely opaque universe beyond @xmath2 . in the context of the standard cold dark matter model ( bahcall et al .",
    "1999 ) there is by now a clear consensus that galaxies of mass @xmath8 are largely responsible for the final cosmological reionization ( e.g. , barkana & loeb 2001 ; madau 2002 ; wyithe & loeb 2003a , b ; mackey , bromm , & hernquist 2003 ; cen 2003a , b ; venkatesan , tumlinson , & shull 2003 ; ciardi , ferrara , & white 2003 ; somerville & livio 2003 ; fukugita & kawasaki 2003 ; sokasian et al .",
    "2003 ) . the recent wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observations ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) appear to confirm a much more extended reionization process , with the first reionization occurring at a redshift possibly as high as @xmath9 ( cen 2003a ) . as a result",
    ", our observational frontier is quickly being pushed towards high redshifts not thought possible just a few years ago .",
    "it is of great interest to directly detect the sources of reionization and the ionization state of the intergalactic medium from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .    to date the observed lyman alpha emitters ( lae ) at @xmath12 appear to be quite luminous with star formation rate ( sfr ) probably in excess of @xmath13yr@xmath14 ( hu et al .",
    "2002 ; kodaira et al .",
    "2003 ) , which , if assuming a starburst of duration of @xmath15yrs and star formation efficiency of @xmath16 , would give @xmath17 of stars .",
    "the masses of these galaxies most likely exceed @xmath18 .",
    "these observed laes are thus much more massive than the typical galaxies thought to produce most of the ionizing photons at @xmath3  current observations are just scraping the tip of an iceberg . because of the damping wing of the gunn - peterson trough cast by the significantly neutral intergalactic medium ( igm ) before reionization ( miralda - escud 1998 ) , the intrinsic luminosities ( after correcting for possible gravitational lensing effects ) for these observed laes may be still larger .",
    "consistent with this , typical laes observed at somewhat lower redshift appear to be less luminous by a factor of ten or more ( yan , windhorst , & cohen 2003 ; rhoads et al .",
    "2003 ; taniguchi et al .",
    "2003 ) . for smaller galaxies of mass @xmath8",
    "typically with an intrinsic ly@xmath0 line width narrower than @xmath19km / s , the absorption by the damping wing of intervening neutral igm is dramatically more severe , probably rendering them undetectable ( haiman 2002 ) .    in this _",
    "we suggest that targeted , very narrowband observations of ly@xmath0 emission at strmgren spheres of known luminous quasars at @xmath3 may provide a unique window to directly detect the bulk of the sources for cosmological reionization , because a large fraction of galaxies in such regions can transmit their ly@xmath0 emission lines largely unattenuated .",
    "in the absence of hydrogen recombination with a static density field , the proper radius @xmath20 of the strmgren sphere of a quasar of age @xmath21 is such that the number of hydrogen atoms in the sphere equals the total number of ionizing photons produced by the source ( cen & haiman 2000 ) : @xmath22^{1/3}=4.3x_{\\rm igm}^{-1/3}\\left(\\frac{\\dot n_{\\rm ph}}{1.3\\times 10^{57}{\\rm s^{-1}}}\\right)^{1/3}\\left(\\frac{t_q}{2\\times10 ^ 7{\\rm yr}}\\right)^{1/3}\\left(\\frac{1+z_q}{7.28}\\right)^{-1}~{{\\ , { \\rm mpc}}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the mean hydrogen density within @xmath20 , @xmath24 is the neutral hydrogen fraction of the igm , and @xmath25 is emission rate of ionizing photons from the quasar . for @xmath23 ,",
    "we have adopted the mean igm density with @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the observed flux of sdss 1030 + 0524 ( haiman & cen 2002 ) . in the realistic case with an evolving cosmological density field and a finite hydrogen recombination time ,",
    "@xmath20 can be computed in detail ( cen & haiman 2000 ) . but @xmath20 estimated in equation ( 1 ) gives a reasonable approximation to the truth ( haiman & cen 2002 ) at redshift @xmath28 .    at sufficiently large separations from the ly@xmath0 line center ( @xmath29 )",
    "the optical depth of the damping wing is ( miralda - escud 1998 ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is baryon density parameter , @xmath32 is the helium mass fraction of the primordial gas , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the hubble constant at redshift zero and @xmath35 , respectively , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the observed wavelength separation from the line center and the observed wavelength of the ly@xmath0 line , respectively . replacing @xmath38 by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the distance between the surface of the strmgren sphere and the point @xmath41 inside the strmgren sphere in question along the line of sight and @xmath42 is the speed of light , and approximating @xmath43 , we obtain @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the proper quasar - centric distance of the point in question and @xmath46 is the angle between the line segment from the quasar to the observer and the line segment from the quasar to @xmath41",
    ".    the gunn - peterson optical depth due to the residual neutral hydrogen inside the strmgren sphere , in the absence of other ionizing sources , can be expressed as ( cen & haiman 2000 ) @xmath47 , due to a very small residual neutral fraction @xmath48 . as a result of small @xmath49",
    ", the local mini - strmgren spheres produced by ly@xmath0 galaxies would render the absorption due to all residual neutral hydrogen inside the strmgren sphere negligible .",
    "the total ly@xmath0 optical depth at @xmath41 is hence just @xmath50 . from equation ( 3 )",
    "we see that , for a luminous quasar like sdss 1030 + 0524 , ly@xmath0 lines from galaxies located within the central region region of @xmath51mpc , would suffer a total optical depth of @xmath52 corresponding @xmath46 from @xmath53 to @xmath54 , i.e. , a flux reduction of @xmath55 , assuming @xmath56 .",
    "it is evident that there is a significant region within the strmgren sphere where most of the ly@xmath0 emission galaxies are able to transmit the ly@xmath0 emission lines largely unattenuated .",
    "there are several potentially very interesting applications from direct observations of regions around luminous quasars prior to the completion of cosmological reionization . before turning to the possible applications it is useful to estimate the abundance of possibly detectable galaxies at @xmath3 . assuming that the fraction of all mass having formed into halos with masses @xmath57 is @xmath58 and that starbursts each with a duration of @xmath59 has occurred once in each halo in the last half hubble time",
    ", then we find that the comoving number density of such galaxies is @xmath60mpc@xmath61 . assuming a star formation efficiency @xmath62 we obtain the star formation rate in each galaxy @xmath63/yr .",
    "this simple estimate , however , involves two currently unknown parameters , @xmath62 and @xmath59 .    perhaps a better way to estimate",
    "the abundance and luminosity of lae is to utilize both hierarchical cdm model and lae survey observations at highest accessible redshift , currently at @xmath64 .",
    "figure 1 shows the predicted cumulative number density of galaxies at @xmath65 ( solid curve ) and @xmath66 ( dashed curve ) for a cosmological constant dominated cold dark matter model with @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69km / s / mpc , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . the observational data point for lae shown as the solid dot in figure 1",
    "is taken from rhoads et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who give @xmath72mpc@xmath61 at @xmath64 .",
    "we have  normalized \" the observational data point to the theoretical prediction at @xmath65 by requiring the same abundance , which then gives an implied mass threshold of the observed lae by rhoads et al .",
    "clearly , even the lae observed at @xmath64 by rhoads et al .",
    "are quite massive with masses about @xmath73 , if the adopted cold dark matter model is correct .",
    "the computed lower bound of star formation rate for the observed lae at @xmath64 by rhoads et al .  of @xmath74 corresponds to the flux sensitivity of @xmath75erg/@xmath76/sec of their lala survey .",
    "if we assume that the ly@xmath0 luminosity of an lae is simply proportional to its mass , it would require a flux sensitivity of @xmath77)erg/@xmath76/sec to detect galaxies of mass of @xmath78 with corresponding abundance of @xmath79mpc@xmath61 at @xmath66 ( open circles in figure 1 ) , respectively .    between night sky lines",
    "there are a few good observational windows at @xmath80 ( corresponding to @xmath81 for the ly@xmath0 line ) , most notably the one center at @xmath64 and the other at @xmath82 .",
    "however , even within those  good \" windows the required integration time to detect fainter lae using keck telescopes is quite long , @xmath83/sec)@xmath84hours ( gjorgovski 2003 , private communications ; fan 2003 , private communications ) , implying that approximately a hundred hours is needed on keck to detect galaxies of mass @xmath85 , _ even in the absence of significantly attenuation by neutral igm_. the current observational limit for ly@xmath0 flux roughly corresponds to @xmath86 a few @xmath87yrs at @xmath2 ( hu et al .",
    "2002 ; yan , windhorst , & cohen 2003 ; rhoads et al .  2003",
    "; taniguchi et al .",
    "detecting even lower mass lae may be quite infeasible using keck telescopes .",
    "furthermore , for ground - based observations where the primary background noise in the interested spectral regime comes from sky background , it is a very tedious task to search for usable windows between numerous strong sky lines to find high redshift galaxies and quasars .",
    "hence , it is likely necessary to resort to james webb space telescope ( jwst ) for detecting the bulk of galaxies ( of mass @xmath88 ) at @xmath7 . as pointed out by oh ( 1999 )",
    ", jwst should be able to detect the h@xmath89 line ( and possibly h@xmath90 and other balmer lines ) of galaxies of mass @xmath88 at @xmath7 .",
    "a joint detection in ly@xmath0 and h@xmath89 would not only firmly determine the redshift of each galaxy but also shed very useful light on important physical processes of each galaxy including dust content .",
    "in addition , the ratio of ly@xmath0 to h@xmath89 lines would provide a cross - check of the damping wing modulated spatial distribution of lae or a tool to break possible degeneracies in the spatial distribution of lae from ly@xmath0 line alone .",
    "we note that three factors could boost the effectiveness of star formation at high redshift in terms of ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "first , the gas at high redshift may be much metal poor ; for example , taking the same salpeter imf would give about a factor of @xmath91 more ionizing photons hence ly@xmath0 photons for stars with @xmath92 compared to stars with solar metallicity .",
    "second , if the metal poor gas at high redshift forms relatively more massive stars , the efficiency of producing ionizing photons would be higher .",
    "third , the dust content in the high - z metal - poor galaxies should be lower , possibly allowing for relatively more ly@xmath0 photons to escape .",
    "these factors may render high redshift lae more luminous that their low redshift counterparts at a star formation rate .",
    "figure ( 2 ) shows the ratio of the number of galaxies at a distance @xmath93 ( with width @xmath94 ) from the quasar on the blue side over the number of galaxies at the same distance from the quasar on the red side within a quasar - centric transverse radius of @xmath95mpc proper , as a function of @xmath93 .",
    "three panels correspond to three flux sensitivities of @xmath96erg/@xmath97/sec ( panel a ) , @xmath98erg/@xmath97/sec ( panel b ) and @xmath99erg/@xmath97/sec ( panel c ) , which are then translated into the threshold masses of detectable galaxies using figure 1 to infer the corresponding abundances . in each panel",
    "two sets of cases are shown .",
    "case ( 1 ) : @xmath100mpc proper with @xmath101 , respectively , shown as thick solid , thick dotted and thick dashed curves . case ( 2 ) : @xmath102mpc proper with @xmath101 , respectively , shown as thin solid , thin dotted and thin dashed curves .",
    "we choose to plot the ratio instead of the direct number density to avoid ambiguity due to a possibly non - uniform , quasi spherical distribution of galaxies around quasars .",
    "galaxies will still likely be clumpy and clustered on small scales but a large volume considered would smooth out most of the fluctuations .",
    "let us now estimate the accuracy of the data points .",
    "the comoving volume enclosed by a cylindrical region within a transverse radius @xmath103 and a line - of - sight distance of @xmath104 ( from @xmath105 to @xmath106 ) is @xmath107 comoving at @xmath108 , which is then multiplied by the number density of galaxies using the respective @xmath109 from figure 1 to yield the corresponding total number of galaxies above the respective mass threshold .",
    "five data points are used for the indicated @xmath93 range .",
    "the errorbars are shown in each panel for the case with @xmath102mpc proper . from panel",
    "( a ) of figure 2 it is clear that @xmath110 and @xmath111 are distinguishable at @xmath112 level even for galaxies with mass @xmath113 ( panel a ) , detectable by keck telescope with an integration time of order of @xmath19 hours for each galaxy ( assuming one spectrum per observation ) with total @xmath114 galaxies .",
    "this might be a costly project but the potential payoff is attractive .",
    "cases with @xmath111 and @xmath115 can only be marginally differentiated at this sensitivity level . at the same time , it is evident that the models with different @xmath116 can be more easily distinguished , allowing for a precise measurement of @xmath116 .",
    "in addition , a precise measurement of @xmath116 , in conjunction with the spatial information ( see  3.2 ) , may allow a determination of the age of the quasar .",
    "with jwst , if one can reach flux levels @xmath117erg/@xmath76/sec , very precise measurements of @xmath24 can be made , as can be seen from panels ( b , c ) in figure 2 .",
    "we note that @xmath106 corresponds to a line - of - sight comoving distance from the quasar of @xmath118mpc at @xmath108 .",
    "the gravitational influence of the quasar host galaxy at that distance is likely to be negligible , alleviating some possible complications including infall .",
    "in addition , the typical peculiar velocities of galaxies at high redshift is likely be @xmath119km / s , which would correspond to a possible displacement of @xmath120 , too small to significantly matter .",
    "finally , we note that , in the case of a lone lae ( not sitting inside a large strmgren sphere of a luminous quasar ) , an lae estimated to have an sfr about an order of magnitude higher than the solid dot in figure 1 ( hu et al .",
    "2002 ) can only transmit a small fraction of ly@xmath0 flux due to attenuation by the neutral igm ( haiman 2002 ) .",
    "lower mass lae are further devastated by their lower intrinsic line widths in addition to smaller strmgren spheres .",
    "as haiman ( 2002 ) pointed out , no ly@xmath0 line of an lae narrower than @xmath19km / s can be observed .",
    "therefore , it is estimated that no lae galaxies less massive than @xmath121 will be detectable in a random field outside a large strmgren sphere of a luminous source .      fitting the data to obtain @xmath116 and @xmath24 (  3.1 ) would yield precise information on @xmath50 , which in turn would allow a determination of a region on the red side of the quasar where attenuation due to intervening neutral igm is negligible",
    "consequently , one can construct an unbiased luminosity function given the likely availability of up to thousands of galaxies in that region , which would further allow for corrections to be made for  missing \" galaxies in other regions where @xmath50 is appreciable .",
    "moreover , the spatial distribution of galaxies in this region and others in other regions would allow an accurate determination of the clustering properties of galaxies up to a scale of @xmath122mpc comoving .",
    "given the determined luminosity function and @xmath24 , along with follow - up spectroscopic observations of the galaxies detected which would produce the line widths for these galaxies , we could self - consistently determine a fraction of these galaxies that would be directly observed even sitting in an average region and their possible observable features .      taking the farthest red region as an unbiased region",
    ", this would then allow a determination of luminosity - dependent biased distributions of galaxies , down to the lowest luminosity of galaxies in the farthest red region .",
    "this may shed useful light on the formation of quasars and their host galaxies . whether or not the farthest red region is an unbiased",
    ",  average \" region can be checked using the same data , where one may expect to see a diminished radial gradient .",
    "the three - dimensional information of the distribution of galaxies around a quasar makes it possible to probe the angular distribution of emission from the quasar .",
    "it should be relatively straightforward to build self - consistent models to account for possible outcomes from observations .",
    "for example , if galaxy abundance drops off rapidly at a transverse distance significantly smaller than the inferred @xmath116 , it would indicate that the quasar emission is bi - polar , whose angles can be inferred . if , in addition , there is a strong suppression of galaxies on the red side of the quasar even at small @xmath123 , it would imply that the quasar emission is largely beamed towards us .",
    "we will not attempt to make more detailed models here .",
    "if the standard unified model for agn / quasars ( e.g. , antonucci 1993 ) is correct , the ensuing consequence on the distribution of laes around quasars will clearly be detectable .",
    "this method may provide the first and accurate way to test this picture .    in summary",
    ", we show that , with a tunable , very narrowband filter of @xmath124 or a narrowband filter of @xmath5 to survey a luminous quasar strmgren sphere with follow - up spectroscopic identifications of the ly@xmath0 emission lines of individual galaxies inside the quasar strmgren sphere , we could obtain a wealth of information for the high redshift galaxies that are responsible for reionizing the universe at @xmath2 . this same technique may be applicable to quasars at any high redshift . at higher redshift ,",
    "galaxies are somewhat less massive , but they may have a more top - heavy imf , possibly a higher star formation efficiency , a shorter starburst duration and much lower dust content .",
    "these positive , compensatory effects could possibly render high redshift galaxies with mass @xmath125 intrinsically as luminous as galaxies of mass @xmath8 at @xmath10 .",
    "we expect that jwst should be able to detect these galaxies at @xmath126 ( eisenstein 2003 ) , provided that a tunable , narrowband filter at appropriate wavelengths is available .",
    "we show that targeted observations at the strmgren spheres of known luminous quasars with tunable very narrowband filters of width @xmath127 or a narrowband filter of @xmath5 to survey a luminous quasar strmgren sphere with follow - up spectroscopic identifications of the ly@xmath0 emission lines of individual galaxies would provide a direct way to observe the ly@xmath0 emission lines of the bulk of galaxies at @xmath7 in the mass range @xmath8 that are believed to be responsible for the second cosmological reionization . at present",
    "it appears that ground - based observations , such as by keck , can only detect a relatively small fraction , high end tail of galaxies with mass @xmath128 .",
    "but even such observations may already be able to differentiate between a fully neutral and a 10% neutral intergalactic medium at @xmath7 .",
    "jwst should provide the unique opportunity to detect the bulk of galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the likely gain in sensitivity with a tunable , very narrowband filter may allow jwst to detect the pop iii galaxies of mass @xmath125 with a top - heavy imf at @xmath126 . in this case , the key is to search for luminous enough quasars at these very high redshifts , perhaps requiring an infrared survey comparable to sdss .",
    "this is presently technologically challenging but the potential scientific payoff is immense .    we show that such observations will allow for accurate determinations of the ionization state of the igm , the sizes of the strmgren spheres , the ages of the quasars , the luminosity function of high redshift galaxies and its evolution , the spatial distribution of galaxies and its evolution , the biased distribution of galaxies around quasars and the anisotropy of quasar emission .",
    "if the universe was indeed reionized twice ( cen 2003a ) , then there will be a window of opportunity somewhere at @xmath129 , where galaxies can transmit ly@xmath0 lines ( as well as optical - uv continuum and other emission lines ) unabsorbed ; they should be directly observable by jwst even in the absence of luminous quasars .",
    "a signature continuum cutoff of the spectra of these galaxies shortward of @xmath130 would pin down the redshift of the second cosmological recombination epoch @xmath131 and then a rapid thinning out of the number density of ly@xmath0 galaxies at some redshift @xmath132 would be indicative of the first reionization epoch .",
