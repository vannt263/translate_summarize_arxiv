    "statistical physics studies of cooperative phenomena on random graphs have attracted a lot of new attention and undergone impressive new development since it has become clear that many real - life interconnected structures are well approximated by random scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "one can say that a paradigm shift is occurring from studies of models for critical phenomena on ( bravais ) lattices to studies in which such models are defined on random networks . to some extent",
    "this paradigm shift resembles that from euclidean geometry to fractal geometry , in the modeling of various natural phenomena , but scale - free networks are specific in that they are characterized by the presence of a small but important set of _ hubs_. the hubs are highly connected nodes which typically have a large influence on the operation and coherence of the structure .    when we are concerned with the distribution of electricity , or the production and sale of material goods by commercial centers to consumers , or the delivery of the daily mail ...",
    ", we can envisage distribution centers as nodes and consumers as links on a network .",
    "the consumers have certain demands and the distribution centers certain deliverables .",
    "the distribution centers can be active or inactive depending on internal conditions and on external criteria such as the demands of consumers that are linked to them and the status of other nearby centers .",
    "the occurrence of hubs in such networks is rather common ( main providers , supermarkets , ... ) .",
    "we propose a model that can capture three types of common distribution policies in realistic trade environments by implementing an appropriate ising spin hamiltonian on a random network , mainly of scale - free type , but we also consider networks with a scale .",
    "we present the three policies in a logical order , from obviously cooperative to rather ambivalent , and our main goal in this paper will be to demonstrate how a policy in the latter category can cause a breakdown of the distribution network .",
    "the first policy is one that is _ guided by demand_. the distribution center aims at satisfying the consumer demand as closely as possible and will strive to adjust its activity to that of neighbouring centers so that the difference between demand and delivery is minimal on the links that lead to those centers . note that every consumer ( link ) can be served by two centers ( the adjacent nodes ) in this model .",
    "this is not unusual .",
    "many consumers rely on an alternative option in case their normal provider is not available .",
    "a distribution center @xmath0 is active or _ up _",
    "when @xmath1 and inactive or _ down _",
    "when @xmath2 .",
    "the _ demand - guided policy _ is characteristic of a market in which _ compensation or complementarity is more important than competition_. many physical , chemical and biological systems are equipped with similar _ negative feedback _",
    "mechanisms , rendering operation stable under small enough perturbations .",
    "the second distribution policy is concerned with a _ competitive market _ guided by product quality and quantity . in this policy production or distribution",
    "centers strive to maximize their activity in order to get _ their _ deliverables consumed rather than those of their rivals .",
    "the centers aim at manipulating consumers by _ creating new demand _ , preferably in situations where the existing demand is low . in this _ product - guided policy _",
    "the centers tend to become active especially when their neighbours are already satisfying the consumer demand .",
    "this policy can therefore be mimicked by maximizing the difference between supply and demand , which is opposite to what we postulated in the demand - guided policy described before .",
    "thirdly , we wish to capture a _ policy of solidarity _ rather than competition , in which providers display a voluntary or forced shutdown in situations where _ too high a demand can not reasonably be met_. as long as all centers are active there are no problems , but as soon as some become inactive , the burden of satisfying the high consumer demand can become too heavy to carry .",
    "the centers can be unwilling or plainly incapable of rectifying the drop in supply , and increasingly so as time progresses and more neighbouring centers fail .",
    "this is a pronounced _ positive feedback _ mechanism which can lead to blackouts in power stations or certain kinds of strikes ( when workers are unable or unwilling to do more than their peers ) .",
    "a similar conduct may be observed , for example , among partners in projects .",
    "here we assume that a link is a project shared between adjacent nodes , which can model persons or companies .",
    "companies tend to close or , equivalently , persons tend to stop doing their job , when their neighbours no longer invest in a joint project ( i.e. , when neighbouring sites are down ) . like in the ( second )",
    "competitive policy we discussed , in this ( third ) solidarity policy the difference between supply and demand is again maximized , but this time by the supply dropping to zero .    in order to integrate these three policies in an ising model hamiltonian description",
    "we define , besides the spin states associated with the distribution centers , the supply and demand variables on the links . for the purpose of this motivation , we focus on the simplest version of the model , but still sufficiently equipped to bring out the essential physics . in later sections a more refined approach will be outlined . for the time being we assume that each distribution center , when active , delivers a fixed total amount ( set to unity ) to all of the links attached , divided equally over all links . for the link between nodes @xmath0 and @xmath3 with respective degrees @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the delivery thus equals @xmath6 treating , provisionally , the demand as a uniform constant @xmath7 throughout the network , we arrive according to the policies described above at an energy per link which can be written as @xmath8 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where the nearest - neighbour coupling @xmath9 is _ negative _ for a _ demand - guided _ policy and _ positive _ for the policies driven by _ competition or solidarity_. the hamiltonian of the ising distribution network is then the sum of these energies over all links .",
    "we obtain the _ spin hamiltonian _ of a given realization of a network with @xmath10 nodes , @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes nearest - neighbour pairs and the _ quenched random field _ @xmath13 acting on the spin at node @xmath0 is given by @xmath14 the spin - independent constant ( last term in eq .",
    "( [ hami ] ) ) is irrelevant for our purposes and will henceforth be omitted .",
    "the interpretation of the quenched random field is fairly transparent . for @xmath15 ( demand - guided policy ) a distribution center",
    "experiences a bias to become active when the total demand of the attached links , @xmath16 , exceeds the total _ average delivery _ to these links , @xmath17 , where the average is taken over the spin values , i.e. , over active and inactive states . for @xmath18",
    "the spin bias is opposite .",
    "a distribution center tends to become inactive when the demand is high .",
    "the nearest - neighbour interaction , @xmath19 , is also a quenched random variable , the sign of which is equal to that of @xmath9 .",
    "note that this degree - dependent interaction is reminiscent of that in the special attention network model @xcite , in the sense that _ high degree is compensated by weak interaction_. in the distribution model this means that the mutual influence between neighbouring centers is proportional to the product of their deliveries to the link that connects them , or to some power of this product .",
    "we conclude that we are dealing with a random - field ( anti-)ferromagnetic ising model on a network for @xmath20 @xmath18 .",
    "the ground state , which minimizes the total energy , is in general non - trivial .",
    "in addition ,  thermal \" noise is present , due to occasional maintenance shutdowns of centers or fluctuations of their activity caused by other internal factors .",
    "we therefore consider the model at a finite temperature @xmath21 to allow for these more or less random perturbations .",
    "the ratio @xmath22 is a measure of their importance .",
    "preliminary results of monte carlo simulations of the model at hand were reported by giuraniuc @xcite .",
    "consider a static scale - free network with @xmath10 nodes .",
    "the normalized distribution of the degrees , the number of links attached to each node , @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , is assumed to follow a decreasing power - law @xmath25 for large @xmath26 .",
    "the topological exponent @xmath27 usually lies in the regime @xmath28 for real - life networks @xcite .",
    "each node @xmath0 represents a distribution center which can be either active ( @xmath29 ) or inactive ( @xmath2 ) . a link between nodes @xmath0 and @xmath3 , denoted by @xmath30 , is a _ consumer _ or a region across which the products are distributed .",
    "contrary to the simplified model proposed in the motivation , the nodes can produce unequal amounts of goods .",
    "we assume that the total delivery depends on the degree of the supplier .",
    "therefore , the delivery @xmath31 to a link @xmath12 is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the degrees of the nodes linked by @xmath12 . the exponent @xmath33 controls the total production of a supplier . when node @xmath0 is active or @xmath29 , supplier @xmath0 furnishes @xmath34 products to each of its @xmath4 consumers .",
    "the total delivery of the active node is thus @xmath35 .",
    "the case @xmath36 corresponds to the special case in the motivation in which all active nodes provide the same total supply .",
    "consumers attached to highly - connected nodes then receive a smaller amount . in general",
    ", the hubs deliver less goods to a single consumer for @xmath37 . for @xmath38",
    ", every consumer would be receiving the same amount of products in an active state , which also implies that hubs have to deliver more goods in total .",
    "finally , @xmath39 corresponds to the situation in which the highly - connected suppliers can deliver more goods to each consumer .",
    "following the reasoning introduced in the motivation , every consumer has a demand @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the demand of link @xmath12 may depend on @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the energy per link is now given by @xmath40 ^ 2.\\ ] ] the total hamiltonian becomes @xmath41 up to constant ( spin - independent ) terms , which are neglected .",
    "the sums over @xmath3 run over the @xmath4 neighbours of node @xmath0 .",
    "this short reasoning leads to two fields applied to each node @xmath0 .",
    "the _ quenched random field _",
    "@xmath13 is inherent in the network and the _ interaction field _",
    "@xmath42 originates from the interactions with spins linked to @xmath43 .    in this paper",
    "we focus mainly on the third policy introduced in the motivation .",
    "we describe avalanches in distribution networks which occur due to the _ solidarity among suppliers_. the interaction constant @xmath9 is thus positive .",
    "note that avalanches in anti - ferromagnetic spin systems with a uniform external field on complex networks have been studied in ref .",
    "avalanches in distribution models were also studied using sand piles on networks @xcite and in various models based on critical loads @xcite .",
    "recently , also models studying percolation in interdependent networks were used @xcite .",
    "finally , we propose a suitable demand function .",
    "the demand of a link @xmath12 between nodes @xmath0 and @xmath3 is a combination of a link - dependent and a homogeneous part : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are real constants .",
    "the notation @xmath47 denotes an average over the degree distribution @xmath23 .",
    "the first term , the _ supply - adjusted demand _ is a consequence of the form of the fields @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltoniaan ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath48 controls which fraction of the normal capacity is demanded by the consumers on the link .",
    "each link @xmath12 also features an intrinsic uniform demand , independent of the deliveries of the nodes @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "the second term , regulated by the constant @xmath46 , provides such a _ global demand_. the onset of a homogeneous consumer demand ( @xmath49 ) results in a total field on the network which has the same order of magnitude as the interaction field in an active state averaged over an ensemble of different networks .",
    "note that in certain systems individual consumers can deliver goods _ to _ the market .",
    "for instance , individual households can contribute to the power grid with the output of their own solar cells .",
    "negative values of @xmath46 are therefore not excluded .",
    "the total field acting on node @xmath0 is now given by @xmath50.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that only the last term depends on the interaction with the spins on the neighbouring sites .",
    "it will play a prominent role in the cascading effect . for general values of @xmath33 ,",
    "both the interaction and the quenched random field applied on node @xmath0 will depend on the connectivity of node @xmath0 and on the connectivity of its neighbours .",
    "however , in some cases simplifications can be made .",
    "if @xmath38 , the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath46 can be replaced by a single parameter @xmath51 . the total field",
    "is then simplified to @xmath52 both the interaction field and the quenched random field acting on a node are then independent of the degrees of the neighbouring sites . for arbitrary @xmath33",
    "the quenched random field is independent of the connectivity of the neighbouring nodes for @xmath53 .",
    "note finally that for @xmath54 and @xmath55 the demand just matches the average supply ( the average being taken over active and inactive providers ) and the quenched random field vanishes , i.e. , @xmath56 , @xmath57 . an ising model with connectivity - dependent coupling constants in the absence of an external field",
    "was studied by giuraniuc _",
    "et al . _",
    "it was shown to be equivalent to a model with homogeneous couplings and with a modified topological exponent @xmath58 .",
    "the quenched random and interaction fields featured in eq .",
    "( [ totaalveld ] ) depend on the local structure of each network .",
    "handy analytic approximations can be obtained by performing an ensemble average over different network realizations with the same degree distribution . in a first step ,",
    "we average over the degree of the neighbours to obtain the average field applied on node @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath59 denote the probability that the neighbour of node @xmath0 has connectivity @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the network is uncorrelated .",
    "the distribution @xmath59 is then independent of node @xmath0 and related to the degree distribution @xmath60 by the relation @xmath61 .",
    "therefore we define the average over the degrees of the neighbouring sites of node @xmath0 as follows : @xmath62 this type of averaging is a  topological \" mean - field approximation .",
    "simultaneously , we may in some situations wish to apply a  thermal \" mean - field approach to the thermally fluctuating spin variables and replace the actual spins of the neighbours by a mean spin .",
    "if we furthermore assume that the mean spin is homogeneous throughout the network , the average quenched random and interaction fields acting on node @xmath0 in the mean - field approach are    velden h_i_i&=&jq_i^1 - 2+jq_i^1-(1-a - b ) , + i_i(\\{})_i&=&jq_i^1- _ av ,    with @xmath63 the average spin of a node .",
    "deviations from these averages are important for a network in which the degree distribution @xmath23 possesses diverging moments .",
    "for instance , in a scale - free network with topological exponent @xmath64 , the second moment diverges .",
    "note that the average quenched random and interaction fields fields on a node diverge for @xmath65 .",
    "therefore we will henceforth limit our attention to the case @xmath66 . since we only consider scale - free networks with a finite mean degree , i.e. , with @xmath67 , this limitation is only important for @xmath68 .    in a second step ,",
    "we average over the degrees of the nodes using the degree distribution @xmath23 .",
    "the average hamiltonian @xmath69 is then given by @xmath70 inserting both members of eq .",
    "( [ velden ] ) we obtain @xmath71 eq .  ( [ meanham ] ) provides a mean - field expression for the hamiltonian averaged over different realizations of the same network .",
    "for the study of a collapsing network , driven by competition or solidarity ( @xmath18 ) , we exploit the _",
    "ferromagnetic _ phase which appears in the ising model at sufficiently low temperatures and for sufficiently weak random - field fluctuations .",
    "recall that the ground state ( @xmath72 ) in the absence of fields consists of two degenerate configurations : the _ active _ network in which @xmath73 @xmath0 , @xmath29 , and the _ inactive _ network in which @xmath73 @xmath0 , @xmath2 . by applying a uniform bulk field ,",
    "the degeneracy is lifted and a unique equilibrium state emerges .",
    "nevertheless , the network can reside for a long time in the oppositely magnetized  metastable \" state if the fields and ( thermal ) spin fluctuations are too small to trigger the collapse to the equilibrium state .",
    "metastability is defined _ dynamically _ in our context as partial stability with respect to certain perturbations , in contrast with absolute stability ( with respect to any perturbation ) . in our model , in the presence of random fields of microscopic origin , which are inhomogeneous and regulated by the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath46 and @xmath33",
    ", the ground state may be non - trivial and will coincide with the all - up or all - down states only under certain conditions on the random fields .",
    "therefore , considering metastable states , we need to distinguish between states that decay to a ferromagnetic state or evolve to a  glassy \" state",
    ". we will be interested mostly in the ferromagnetic state because in a glassy state the network is still more or less active .",
    "thus , in our study of distribution networks driven by solidarity , we will mainly focus on the decay of the all - up state ( active network ) to an essentially all - down state ( inactive network ) .",
    "when the global consumer demand ( modeled by @xmath46 ) is increased , the metastable states we study by means of a suitable spin - flip dynamics , mimic the behavior of certain realistic systems .",
    "for example , from 1988 to 1998 , us electricity demands increased by nearly 30% while the network capacity grew only by 15%  @xcite .",
    "apparently as a result of this widening gap between demand and supply , the system became metastable , which only became apparent when a large part of the power grid broke down .    in the following ,",
    "we start from an active network and determine under which conditions a collapse to the inactive ground state is likely to occur . after an active period ,",
    "avalanches to the inactive state can only take place if the system initially resides in a metastable active state and then decays to the energetically more favourable inactive state . in the following these requirements",
    "are converted into conditions in terms of the constants of the distribution model .",
    "there are indeed two basic restrictions in order to see avalanche effects .",
    "the first one concerns the metastability of the active state .",
    "the active state should remain intact for a sufficiently long time .",
    "focussing on single - spin - flip dynamics , this requirement corresponds to the impossibility that at zero temperature a spin spontaneously flips from @xmath74 to @xmath75 while its surrounding remains active ( + 1 ) . in such a hypothetical process , only the local energy associated with node @xmath0 changes by an amount @xmath76 given by @xmath77 at zero temperature ,",
    "single - spin flips are excluded provided @xmath78 . the definition of the fields , eq .",
    "( [ totaalveld ] ) , then leads to the requirement @xmath79 where the sum is over the @xmath4 neighbours of node @xmath0 .",
    "the condition depends on the specific local structure around each node in the network .    in order to obtain a simple and useful analytical approximation to this",
    ", we can average over the degree of the nearest neighbours . the averaging procedure defined in eq .",
    "( [ averagen ] ) entails the replacement @xmath80 note that the substitution defined in eq .",
    "( [ replacement ] ) is only exact for @xmath38 .",
    "for @xmath81 it is a topological mean - field approximation . within this approximation",
    "the active state is metastable ( i.e. , stable against single - spin flips at @xmath72 ) if for all possible degrees @xmath4 , @xmath82 this condition is equivalent to @xmath83 which is the metastability criterion for the mean fields defined in eq .",
    "( [ velden ] ) .",
    "the mean - field approximation can therefore by formulated directly in terms of the mean fields .",
    "( [ mayo ] ) clearly sets an upper limit to the global demand .",
    "if it is too large , a metastable active state is not possible and there will be an  immediate \" decay to the inactive ground state . depending on the signs of @xmath84 and @xmath33 ,",
    "two situations can be distinguished . for @xmath85 and @xmath86",
    ", it suffices that the largest possible degree , @xmath87 , satisfies eq .",
    "( [ mayo ] ) . on the other hand , for @xmath85 and @xmath88 ,",
    "the smallest possible degree , @xmath89 , is the important one . for @xmath90 ,",
    "the converse is true .    if more than one spin is allowed to flip at the same time , the criterion eq .",
    "( [ mayo ] ) must be extended .",
    "the energy difference associated with a multiple - spin - flip process can be smaller in magnitude than the energy difference pertaining to a single - spin - flip process .",
    "for instance , for a process in which two nearest neighbours @xmath0 and @xmath3 flip , the total energy difference of the double - spin - flip process @xmath91 would be @xmath92 which ( for @xmath18 ) is not only always lower than the sum of the energy differences of the two single - spin - flip processes separately ( @xmath93 ) , but can even be lower than the energy change involved in a single - spin - flip process .",
    "this can be appreciated by considering for example the special case @xmath94 , for which the average value @xmath95 vanishes .",
    "the energy difference may in general be reduced further if more than two neighbouring spins can flip simultaneously . in real distribution networks",
    "multiple - spin flips can model multiple suppliers failing at the same time , when , for instance , raw materials are exhausted .",
    "however , we will not consider these instances but rather allow for random technical failures besides deliberate decisions arising from interactions , making it unlikely that multiple suppliers break down exactly simultaneously .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , single - spin - flip dynamics is assumed throughout the remainder of our paper .    as a second restriction , we require the inactive state to have a lower total energy at @xmath72 than any other state .",
    "this condition ensures that the breakdown occurs towards the inactive state rather than to another , glassy state , which minimizes the energy in regions of the parameter space where the local random fields dominate the ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "the reason for this limitation is that we wish to study principally the blackout phenomenon in which , after some time , a state with _ very low activity _ is reached .",
    "a sufficient condition for the inactive state ( all spins down ) to be the ground state ( at @xmath72 ) is that all local quenched random fields have the same sign , in this case negative .",
    "the exact requirement is @xmath96 , or @xmath97 in the mean - field approximation adopted in the previous paragraph this becomes @xmath98 eq .",
    "( [ 2fransen ] ) and its simplified version eq .",
    "( [ wontonton ] ) provide a threshold for the demand sufficient to observe decays to the inactive state . when the demand is smaller than this threshold , the absolute stability of the inactive state is not guaranteed",
    ". then the system may remain stable in the active configuration ( all spins up ) or evolve to a glassy state .",
    "once more , different regimes can be identified according to the values of @xmath48 and @xmath33 .",
    "for example , for positive @xmath33 , if @xmath86 it suffices that the smallest possible degree satisfies eq .",
    "( [ wontonton ] ) . however , if @xmath88 , the relevant quantity is the largest degree .",
    "these statements are to be interchanged if @xmath33 is negative .",
    "the two conditions eq .  ( [ 2belgen ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ 2fransen ] ) , or their mean - field approximations eq .  ( [ mayo ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ wontonton ] ) , determine the region in a @xmath99-phase diagram where collapses of an active network to an inactive one should be observable .",
    "a graphical representation of the phase diagram for distribution models with @xmath100 and @xmath101 can be found in fig .",
    "[ fasediagramvsmu ] .",
    "the shaded region on the figure indicates the ranges of @xmath48 and @xmath46 within which the two requirements are satisfied for a scale - free network with topological constant @xmath102 , minimal degree @xmath103 and 1000 nodes . the uppermost line ( dotted )",
    "is the numerically exact upper bound for the stability of the active state against single - spin flips at @xmath72 , the so - called metastability limit , given by eq .",
    "( [ 2belgen ] ) .",
    "this exact condition was determined by simulation of the model on scale - free networks .",
    "the networks were generated in two steps using the uncorrelated configuration model . in a first step ,",
    "@xmath10 nodes are created , each with their own degree , chosen randomly according to the distribution @xmath23 , which is a decreasing power law .",
    "the minimal degree is @xmath104 , while the maximal degree is set to @xmath105 . for @xmath106",
    "this is not a restriction , since the maximal degree satisfies @xmath107 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "for @xmath108 this restriction avoids correlations in the network @xcite . in a second step",
    ", links are laid randomly between all the nodes , with the constraint that at the end of the linking procedure every node should have the degree it was given in the first step .",
    "self linking and multiple linking are avoided .",
    "the results obtained from different network realizations differ slightly . in practice , averaging over 10 networks is sufficient to obtain accurate reproducible results . in this manner",
    "we determine the values of @xmath48 and @xmath46 for which eq .",
    "( [ 2belgen ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ 2fransen ] ) are satisfied for all nodes .",
    "the latter condition leads to the second uppermost line ( solid ) in the figures ( straight line for @xmath109 ; line consisting of two straight segments , with a break at @xmath54 , for @xmath81 ) . above this line",
    "the inactive state is , with certainty , the ground state ( at @xmath72 ) .",
    "the region in between the two lines discussed so far is susceptible of avalanches of spin flips , i.e. , blackouts of the network , and is shown shaded ( in dark grey ) .",
    "the model possesses an overall symmetry , which is reflected in the phase diagrams in fig.1 . inspecting eq .",
    "( [ hamiltoniaan ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ totaalveld ] ) , we conclude that the full hamiltonian is invariant under the transformation : @xmath110 ; @xmath111 ; @xmath112 ( flipping all the spins ) .",
    "this symmetry implies that the lines in the phase diagram pertaining to the active state ( all spins up ) can easily be drawn by applying the above transformation of @xmath46 and @xmath48 on the lines associated with properties of the inactive state ( all spins down ) .",
    "in particular , the lowermost line ( dashed ) marks the metastability limit of the inactive state , and the second lowermost line ( dash - dotted ; broken for @xmath81 ) indicates the limit of absolute stability of the active state . below this line the active state",
    "is , with certainty , the ground state ( at @xmath72 ) .",
    "a remarkable feature of the phase diagram now emerges . while for @xmath38 the two limits of absolute stability coincide , so that there are only ( two ) ferromagnetic ground states , a new zone appears for @xmath81 . in this zone , which we term  no - man s",

    "it may be a glassy state , characterized by local random fields of either sign ( up or down ) that try to orient the spins along their direction , at low @xmath21 , as they compete with the ferromagnetic spin - spin coupling .",
    "the no - man s land is shaded in light grey .",
    "note that the width of this no - man s land vanishes for @xmath113 , and also , for @xmath114 , for which the random fields are trivially all of the same sign , determined by the value of the remaining free parameter @xmath48 or @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "in general , the phase diagram depends on the network topology . however , the case @xmath38 provides an exception . as mentioned before",
    ", the single parameter @xmath115 suffices for describing the supply and demand functions , if @xmath33 vanishes .",
    "the conditions eq .  ( [ mayo ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ wontonton ] ) , which are _ exact _ for @xmath38 , then correspond to the simple conditions @xmath116 . note that these can also be obtained directly starting from eq .",
    "( [ richtingkust ] ) .",
    "these conditions imply that there are no distinctions between different networks at zero temperature if @xmath33 vanishes .",
    "indeed , for @xmath38 , the sign of the quenched random field is independent of the network structure , as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ richtingkust ] ) .",
    "therefore , the topology of the network does not affect the state of the system at @xmath72 .",
    "this prediction is verified by comparing simulations on scale - free networks with simulations on random erds - rnyi graphs . in an erds - rnyi network",
    "all pairs of edges have equal probability to be linked , which implies a poissonian degree distribution .",

    "we would like to mention other studies in which the resistance against cascades was studied as a function of geometrical disorder . in models based on critical loads and percolation in interdependent networks",

    "also the size of the network influences the region available for collapses , mainly through the maximal degree which depends on @xmath10 .",
    "the region in which avalanches are observed decreases if more suppliers are present in the network , as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ mayo ] ) and ( [ wontonton ] ) .",
    "however , a numerical evaluation of these criteria indicates that the effect of the number of suppliers is rather small compared to the effects of the values of @xmath33 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the ranges of the demand parameters @xmath48 and @xmath46 for which collapses occur are influenced most strongly by the network topology and the degree dependence of the delivery in the distribution system .",

    "a single time step corresponds to 1000 single - spin flips .",
    "different types of collapses are observed in different ranges of model parameters , as we will illustrate in the following .    a first point of attention concerns the nodes which initiate the collapse .",
    "apart from the mean magnetization of the network , fig .",
    "[ collapses ] also shows the mean magnetization of the highly connected nodes ( with at least 8 links ) and that of the poorly connected nodes ( with only two neighbours ) . in the first and second collapses , fig .",
    "[ avalanche1 ] and fig .",
    "[ avalanche4 ] , the poorly connected nodes exhibit the largest fluctuations before the collapse . the nodes with a low degree thus initiate the breakdown .",
    "however , the actual collapse only takes place when also the hubs start to flip .",
    "as long as the hubs remain active , their large influence in the network prevents a blackout .",
    "the opposite behavior is found in the avalanches shown in fig .",
    "[ avalanche3 ] and fig .",
    "[ avalanche2 ] , in which the hubs initiate the collapse .",
    "again , the mean magnetization remains positive until also the multitude of less - connected nodes starts to collapse .",
    "thus in all four cases only a certain subset of nodes initiates the network collapse , but the network undergoes a full breakdown as a consequence of a collective effect , in which all nodes are involved .",
    "our model thus displays the cooperative character of distribution networks as described in the motivation .",
    "a simple mean - field argument suggests a condition for determining whether the hubs or the poorly connected nodes initiate the collapse .",
    "the collapse is initiated by the nodes which have the largest fluctuations in the active state .",
    "we introduce an _ activation temperature _ for a node with degree @xmath26 , @xmath142 , by equating its thermal fluctuation energy to the average energy needed to spin flip a node with degree @xmath26 from @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",
    "when @xmath143 the spin of the node will undergo significant thermal fluctuations . within the mean - field approximation ,",
    "@xmath142 is given by @xmath144 we focus on the degree - dependent activation temperature when the network is in an ( almost ) fully active state , thus with @xmath145 .",
    "then , the nodes with the smallest @xmath142 display the largest fluctuations in the active state and can thus initiate the collapse of the network when @xmath21 is slowly raised from zero .",
    "note that whether the activation temperature is either increasing or decreasing as a function of the node degree , depends on the signs of @xmath84 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 ( assuming @xmath148 ) .",
    "let s test these ideas against some of the simulations of network breakdowns shown in fig .  [ collapses ] .",
    "for example , using the model parameters associated with fig .  [ avalanche1 ] , we obtain , with @xmath145 , @xmath149 , which implies that the activation temperature increases with the node degree .",
    "therefore , the poorly connected nodes should initiate the collapse , which is confirmed by the simulations . taking the parameters associated with fig .",
    "[ avalanche2 ] , we find @xmath150 , so that the highly connected nodes should show the largest fluctuations in the active state .",
    "the simulations confirm that the hubs indeed initiate the network collapse .",
    "information about the type of nodes that initiates a collapse is of great interest in real - life networks .",
    "if hubs tend to be the most fragile and thus most fluctuating suppliers , it is best to invest more effort in protecting them rather than the least connected nodes .",
    "of course the converse is true if the poorly - connected nodes are more prone to initiate the collapse .",
    "the criterion of eq .",
    "( [ crit_temp ] ) could therefore be used to strengthen networks purposefully against the consequences of accidental malfunction of distribution centers .      as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ collapses ] , the magnitude of the thermal fluctuations depends not only on the value of @xmath21 but also on that of other parameters of the distribution model . even if the demand is fixed ( constant @xmath48 and @xmath46 ) , thermal fluctuations may still be reduced or amplified depending on the network structure , through the topological exponent @xmath27 , and depending on the delivery in the model , through the delivery exponent @xmath33 .",
    "the starting point of our further analysis is the mean hamiltonian , eq .",

    "( [ varian ] ) and ( [ standdev ] ) , suggest that , subject to conditions to be specified , the dependence on the network topology and on @xmath33 might be captured by the single parameter @xmath151 .",
    "this prompts us to test the conjecture that the mean hamiltonian may possess the following scaling property , @xmath152 where the function @xmath153 is independent of @xmath33 and @xmath27 .",
    "this ansatz is most likely to be valid in at least one of the two following circumstances .",
    "firstly , if @xmath48 is sufficiently close to one ( @xmath154 ) , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ meanham ] ) is negligible compared to the second one and eq .",
    "( [ australie ] ) holds with @xmath155 .",
    "the second situation occurs for large networks and small enough @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath156 , which leads to @xmath157 , as can readily be shown analytically .",
    "indeed , in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath158 , and converting sums over the degree distribution to integrals @xcite , one finds @xmath159 note that , in view of eq .",
    "( [ standdev ] ) , the condition @xmath156 thus ensures that the random - field fluctuations are small . under these circumstances eq .",
    "( [ meanham ] ) indeed takes the scaling form of eq .",
    "( [ australie ] ) with @xmath160 .",
    "although , strictly speaking , this last result is only valid for the range of @xmath33 specified above , numerical inspection shows that it is a good approximation even for values of @xmath33 up till about unity , provided the network is large enough for the @xmath87-dependence of the averages to be negligible .",
    "in general , the approximation remains useful also for finite networks , as numerical analysis shows .",
    "in the remainder of this section we assume @xmath161 .    according to boltzmann statistics and using the ansatz of eq .",

    "we therefore absorb the dependence on the delivery exponent , the topology and the temperature into a single parameter @xmath163 , defined as @xmath164 for systems with fixed @xmath48 and @xmath46 , the finite - temperature behavior of the system is thus controlled by @xmath163 , which acts as an _ effective temperature_. in the next subsections , the effects of both the delivery exponent @xmath33 and the topological exponent @xmath27 on finite - temperature collapses are investigated separately .",

    "the considered distribution network could therefore be effectively strengthened by a decrease of @xmath33 , i.e. , by rendering the amounts of goods delivered to each customer more homogeneously distributed .",
    "in addition to this  mean - field \" effect there is an effect of the fluctuations of the quenched random nearest - neighbour couplings , or _",
    "random - bond fluctuations_. these are of topological origin and induced by the ( quenched ) degree fluctuations of the nodes .",
    "to understand this we recall that previous studies have shown that the ( equilibrium ) critical temperature @xmath167 of the model in zero external field depends rather sensitively on the values of @xmath27 and @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath38 , the critical temperature is finite as long as the second moment of the degree distribution is finite , but diverges as a function of the network size @xmath10 when @xmath168 diverges @xcite , which is the case for @xmath169 . for @xmath81 ,",
    "whether or not @xmath167 is finite ( for an infinite network ) is determined by whether or not the effective exponent @xmath170 exceeds the value 3 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to check also the value of @xmath171 in our distribution systems . in particular , when @xmath33 is increased ( from 0 towards 1 ) , the exponent @xmath171 increases and the hubs become less numerous and less pronounced . consequently , @xmath167 decreases and this also renders the thermal spin fluctuations more important .",
    "this effect will be most relevant for networks with @xmath169 and @xmath172 .",
    "the effects we described are confirmed by simulations in which the mean magnetization is studied versus temperature . in each such simulation",
    "we initialize our network in the metastable active state and we update the spins using single - spin flips during 4000 time steps . at sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "the metastable state remains stable during the entire simulation and the final magnetization ( after 4000 time steps ) remains close to one . repeating this procedure for a sequence of fixed temperatures , _ upon increase of the temperature _",
    "one observes a transition to the regime in which the active state is no longer metastable on the time scale of the simulations .",
    "this ( non - equilibrium ) transition , which takes place at a _ breakdown temperature _ @xmath173 , is marked by a magnetization jump to a negative value .",
    "an inactive state , with @xmath174 , is then reached before the end of the simulations . at still higher temperatures ,",
    "the final magnetization becomes smaller in absolute value and displays a curie - weiss behavior reminiscent of the paramagnetic state .",
    "note that , in the absence of symmetry - breaking fields , the final magnetization would approach zero rather sharply at the equilibrium critical temperature @xmath167 .",

    "these effects could have been expected , since the scaling ansatz eq .",
    "( [ australie ] ) is not well satisfied for @xmath182 , if @xmath33 is arbitrary .",
    "we conclude that , at least in the range @xmath183 , the effects of varying @xmath33 and varying @xmath21 are not independent . a change in @xmath33 can be compensated or  absorbed \" by a change in @xmath21 .",

    "we have identified a scaled or effective temperature variable @xmath163 which incorporates the @xmath27 and @xmath33 dependencies in such a way that a good data collapse can occur when the network activity for various cases is measured as a function of @xmath163 instead of @xmath21 . while this scaling is very useful at the level of a mean - field approximation , we also observed that fluctuations in the node degree , which are large for networks with @xmath169 , are responsible for deviations from simple scaling if also @xmath197 .",
    "the similarity between the model and real - life distribution systems can be improved in various ways . in the distribution model",
    "all the consumers depend on two suppliers . using a bipartite network , i.e.",
    ", a network with two kinds of nodes with links running only between unlike nodes , we can extend the model to incorporate an unrestricted number of suppliers for each consumer , reflecting the consumer s freedom of choice .",
    "another extension is concerned with partly active suppliers . in the current model",
    ", a node is active or inactive . using continuous spins , or discrete potts spins , we could also model suppliers with tunable activity",
    ". extensions of our model could also describe systems that evolve in time , for instance by implementing the model on growing networks or on networks in which rewiring is possible .",
    "time - dependent demand parameters @xmath48 and @xmath46 could be used to model the evolving economic characteristics of the consumers , etc .",
    "we conclude that the distribution model introduced in this paper offers a possible starting point for studying collapses in certain real - life distribution systems , from the viewpoint of the phenomenology of dynamical critical phenomena with a non - conserved order parameter .",
    "note that in contrast with ( most ) other models of distribution or transportation networks @xcite there is no conservation law or continuity equation in our network .",
    "the amounts of goods flowing along the edges of the network are stochastic variables controlled by fluctuating spin states . in this sense",
    "our distribution network based on spin variables provides a complementary approach .",
    "it is a pleasure and an honour to dedicate this paper to professor david sherrington on the occasion of his 70th birthday .",
    "we thank economist marc lambrecht of k.u.leuven for his interest in and his comments on this model .",

    "<S> an elementary ising spin model is proposed for demonstrating cascading failures ( breakdowns , blackouts , collapses , avalanches , ... ) that can occur in realistic networks for distribution and delivery by suppliers to consumers . a ferromagnetic hamiltonian with quenched random fields results from policies that maximize the gap between demand and delivery . </S>",
    "<S> such policies can arise in a competitive market where firms artificially create new demand , or in a solidary environment where too high a demand can not reasonably be met . </S>",
    "<S> network failure in the context of a policy of solidarity is possible when an initially active state becomes metastable and decays to a stable inactive state . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the characteristics of the demand and delivery , as well as the topological properties , which make the distribution network susceptible of failure . </S>",
    "<S> an effective temperature is defined , which governs the strength of the activity fluctuations which can induce a collapse . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results , obtained by monte carlo simulations of the model on ( mainly ) scale - free networks , are supplemented with analytic mean - field approximations to the geometrical random field fluctuations and the thermal spin fluctuations . </S>",
