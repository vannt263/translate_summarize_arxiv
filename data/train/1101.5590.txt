    "the local cluster substructure survey ( locuss see smith et al . 2003 , 2005 ) sample of clusters contains 164 clusters with redshifts between 0.142 and 0.295 .",
    "the locuss aims to measure the relationship between the structure of galaxy clusters and the evolution of the hot gas and galaxies that inhabit them using gravitational lensing data and other observations spanning the electromagnetic spectrum from the radio to x - ray .",
    "example locuss analysis papers relevant to this work are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have imaged a subset of locuss in the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ; @xcite ) effect with the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ; see e.g. @xcite ) centred at 16  ghz .",
    "the sz signal arises from the inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by the hot cluster plasma ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) , with a surface brightness that is independent of redshift and dependencies on plasma density and temperature that are different to those for e.g. x - ray bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "hereafter , we assume a concordance @xmath5cdm cosmology with @xmath6 = 0.3 , @xmath7 = 0.7 and h@xmath8 = 100kms@xmath9mpc@xmath9 .",
    "the dimensionless hubble parameters are defined as @xmath10 = h@xmath8/(x kms@xmath9mpc@xmath9 ) .",
    "all coordinates are given at equinox j2000 .",
    "in this paper we focus on locuss clusters with a declination greater than 20@xmath11 and an x - ray luminosity ( @xmath12 ) greater than 11 @xmath13w over the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band in the cluster rest frame ( according to ebeling et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 , using @xmath14 ) .",
    "radio source contamination can make it difficult to observe the sz effect at 16  ghz and we have not studied the clusters with sources brighter than 10  mjy / beam within 10@xmath15 of the cluster x - ray centre . note that our redshifts correspond to those cited in ebeling et al .",

    "they find @xmath21 , whilst at large radii they find @xmath22 ( using @xmath18 ) .",
    "abell  586 has been studied extensively in the x - ray e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a recent analysis of the temperature profile @xcite shows how the temperature falls from @xmath23 kev at the cluster centre to @xmath24kev at a radius @xmath25 .",
    "cypriano et al . have used the gemini multi - object spectrograph together with x - ray data taken from the _ chandra _ archive to measure the properties of abell  586 .",
    "they compare mass estimates derived from the velocity distribution and from the x - ray temperature profile and find that both give very similar results , @xmath26 within 1.3@xmath27mpc .",
    "they suggest that the cluster is spherical and relaxed with no recent mergers .",
    "the elongation of the sz signal on our map ( figure [ fig : a586 ] ) suggests non - sphericity .",
    "abell  586      we present ami sa maps , large - scale cluster parameters and a _ chandra _ image of abell 611 in figure [ fig : a611 ] .",
    "the @xcite analysis of the _ chandra _ achive data shows that the x - ray isophotes are quite circular , the surface brightness profile is smooth and the brightest cluster galaxy lies at the centre of the x - ray emission .",
    "these results indicate that the cluster is relaxed . from the x - ray data ,",
    "the cluster mass was estimated using an nfw profile , spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium to be 9.32@xmath281.39@xmath29 ( within a radius of 1.8@xmath280.5  mpc ) .",

    "note that the values quoted from donnarumma et al .",
    "are an example of their mass estimates ; from fitting different models they find estimated mass varies significantly ( between 9.3211.11@xmath29 for the x - ray mass and between 4.016.32@xmath29 for the lensing mass ) .",
    "their mass estimates use @xmath18 .",
    "several other analyses of _ chandra _ data produce comparable mass estimates ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "_ weak lensing observations by okabe et al .",
    "using gmrt observations @xcite concluded that abell 611 has no radio halo at 610mhz .",

    "we note that the mass obtained is significantly smaller than the result given in zwart et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ; however , their @xmath34 estimates are biased high .",
    "the bias occurs because they used a low - radius x - ray temperature as a constant temperature throughout the cluster , as is explained by them and in olamaie et al .",
    "the sz maps presented in this paper are similar to those in zwart et al .",

    "we determine the cluster mass to be @xmath30 = 4.0@xmath54@xmath55 and @xmath1 = 1.14@xmath56@xmath57kpc ; both these values are comparable with the hoshino et al . results .",
    "the source environment around the cluster at 16ghz is reasonable : the brightest source is 14mjy ( 11:55:36.63 + 23:13:50.1 ) , but this is 700@xmath58 from the cluster x - ray centre .",
    "after this bright source is subtracted from our data we are left with a low level of residual flux density on the map ; it is unlikely that this residual flux significantly contaminates our cluster detection or parameters .",

    "@xcite observed the cluster with the gmrt at 610mhz and found that the cluster contains a core - halo source .",
    "this is in agreement with the value obtained from _",
    "weak lensing observations by okabe et al .",
    "chandra _ x - ray observations ( @xcite ) also reveal that zw1454.8 + 2233 is a cooling core cluster ; these are often associated with core - halos .",
    "zw1454.8 + 2233      at 16  ghz the source environment around the cluster is challenging : in our la data we detect a 3.9  mjy source at the same position as the cluster , and several other sources with comparable flux densitites @xmath64 from the cluster centre .",
    "however , using our bayesian analysis we are able to accurately model the positions , flux densities and spectral indices of these sources such that , after they are subtracted from our sa maps , we see a significant decrement .",

    "our sz - effect map shows that the cluster may have an irregular shape ; we see low signal - to - noise emission to the se and nw of the cluster x - ray centroid ; however , the centre of the sz emission is coincident with the x - ray centroid .",
    "_ chandra _ observations ( @xcite ) indicate that , although the cluster does not have an irregular shape or elongation , it has discontinuities in its density profile ; this may indicate it is in the latter stages of merging .",
    "the largest discontinuity is observed in the se sector of the cluster and is noted to have a structure similar to a cold front observed in other merging systems such as abell  2142 and abell  3667 .",
    "mazzotta et al .",
    "determined the mass profile for the cluster assuming hydrostatic equilibrium using two distinct regions ( se and nw ) to model the cluster density profile : each region was separately analysed and used to calculate @xmath65 = 4 @xmath28 10 @xmath66 .",
    "rxj1720.1 + 2638      following on from rodrguez - gonzlvez et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , in figure [ temp_comp1 ] we compare the ami sa observed cluster temperatures within @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) with large - radius x - ray values ( @xmath4 ) from _ chandra _ or _ suzaku _ that we have been able to find in the literature .",
    "we use large radius x - ray temperature values as these ignore the complexities of the cluster core and are representative of the average cluster temperature within @xmath671mpc which is measured by ami . before comment on these",
    "we deal with two technical points .",
    "first , for abell  611 , we have plotted two x - ray values ( from _ chandra _ data ) ; one from the accept archive ( @xcite ) which is higher than our ami sa measurement , while the second x - ray measurement from _ chandra _ ( donnarumma et al . )",
    "is consistent with our measurement .",
    "secondly , the accept archive r= 475 - 550kpc temperature for abell  1758a is 16@xmath287kev and for clarity is not included on the plot .    evidently abell  586 , abell  611 ( with the donnarumma et al .",
    "x - ray temperature ) and abell  1413 have corresponding sz and x - ray temperatures while abell  773 , abell  1758a and rxj1720.1 + 2638 have x - ray temperatures significantly higher than their sz temperature .",
    "the position is made clearer by combining the values with those in rodrguez - gonzlvez et al .",
    "the combined data are shown in figure [ temp_comp2 ] , in which there is reasonable correspondence between sz and x - ray temperatures at lower x - ray luminosity , with excess ( over sz ) x - ray temperatures at higher x - ray luminosity .",
    "an exception to this is abell  1413 which despite its high x - ray luminosity is in good agreement with our sz value , but for this cluster we have been able to use _ suzuka _ measurements over r= 700 - 1200kpc .",
    "it is noteworthy that abell  773 , abell  1758a and rxj1720.1 + 2638 are major mergers , and we emphasize the @xmath68 weighting of x - ray temperature measurements .",
    "\\i ) we have good sz detections for eight clusters and a non - detection for zw1454.8 + 2233 .",
    "+ ii ) for the seven detected clusters with @xmath69@xmath13w ( @xmath14 ) , we fit @xmath0 profiles to the cluster signals and find @xmath35 values of 1.7 - 4.3@xmath70 and values @xmath36 of 2.0 - 5.1@xmath71 .",
    "+ iii ) for abell  611 and abell  773 our values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 are lower than those in zwart et al . ( 2010 ) which they thought to be biased high , because they use a high value for @xmath3 ( estimated from a low - radius x - ray measurement ) and assume this value to be constant throughout the cluster .",
    "+ iv ) for the six clusters in the work of this paper for which we have found large - radius @xmath72kpc x - ray spectroscopic temperatures in the literature , we find that @xmath4 and @xmath3 values correspond reasonably well for abell  586 , abell  611 ( with the donnarumma et al .",
    "x - ray temperature rather than the accept archive value ) and abell  1413 , but that correspondence falls away for abell  773 , abell  1758a and rxj1720.1 + 2638 which have a high @xmath4 , for these , @xmath3 is less than @xmath4 .",
    "+ v ) the picture seems to become clearer  although all of this work involves only very small numbers  when we add in the data of rodrguez - gonzlvez et al .",
    "we find that there is reasonable @xmath4:@xmath3 correspondence for the six clusters at lower @xmath4 but that the correspondence breaks down at high @xmath4 .",
    "however , two points are evident .",
    "the more general one is that the breakdown of the @xmath4:@xmath3 correspondence tends to be associated with high @xmath12 and with major mergers .",
    "the more specific one is that abell  1413 has values of @xmath4 and @xmath3 that correspond yet has high @xmath12 : but we have used @xmath4 measured by the _",
    "suzaku _ at very high radius .",
    "+ vi ) we suspect this points to agreement between large - radius sz estimates and larger - radius spectroscopic temperature measurements , but that substantial mergers bias @xmath4 measurements more than @xmath3 ; however we stress again that our sample from that and our companion paper is very small .",
