    "there exist two classes of geometric effects relevant to coherent motion of electrons in low - dimensional systems .",
    "the first is the occurrence of effective potential fields originating from geometric shape of the system @xcite .",
    "suppose that electrons are confined in a low - dimensional curved geometry such as a quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) twisted wire or a two - dimensional curved surface .",
    "provided the curved shape is sufficiently thin , quantum excitation energies in the transverse direction are much larger than those in the tangential direction so that the electron s motion is described by an effective hamiltonian of reduced dimension .",
    "it has been shown that the effective hamiltonian involves effective scalar @xcite and/or vector @xcite potentials whose magnitudes depend on the local geometry of the system .",
    "the presence of the effective fields implies that , for example , electrons moving along a thin twisted wire feel an effective magnetic field ; thus , the electrons will exhibit a quantum phase shift whose magnitude is determined by the internal torsion of the wire .",
    "physical consequences of such the geometry - induced potential fields have been explored with a great interest in the last decade @xcite , owing to the technological progress that enables to fabricate exotic nanostructures having curved geometry @xcite .",
    "the second geometric effect arises in the cyclic motion of electrons along a closed loop .",
    "generally when an electron travels along a closed loop , it acquires a memory of the cyclic motion as a geometric phase in the wavefunction @xcite .",
    "the most important manifestation of the geometric phase is the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect @xcite ; it occurs when an electron goes round in a loop encircling magnetic flux .",
    "it is known that the ab effect has many analogues both in quantum physics and beyond , which evidences the relevance of the effect to diverse fields in physics @xcite .",
    "the existence of the above two geometric effects implies intriguing phenomena peculiar to quasi-1d twisted systems .",
    "the phase shift induced by torsion is , for instance , expected to cause a novel class of persistent current that flows along a closed loop of a twisted wire .",
    "this persistent current flow is novel in the sense that no magnetic flux needs to penetrate inside the loop ; this feature is distinctive compared with usual persistent current in a non - twist quantum loop @xcite . in addition , the torsion - induced phase shift should be manifested in the conductance of the twisted ring .",
    "constructive and destructive interference between the electrons will give rise to a conductance modulation as similar to the ordinary ab oscillation @xcite ; nevertheless , in the twisted ring , the modulation ( if it occurs ) is driven by the torsion instead of penetrating magnetic flux . to examine",
    "the possibility of these two phenomena is interesting from viewpoints of both mathematical physics and nanoscale sciences .    in this article , we present a thorough mathematical derivation of the torsion effect on the coherent electron transport through a twisted quantum ring . we suppose a closed loop of a quantum wire having helical atomic configuration , and consider how the internal torsion of the configuration results in a non - trivial phase shift in the electron s wavefunction .",
    "two physical consequences of the phase shift are reviewed and reconsidered : they are called the torsion - induced persistent current @xcite and the flux - free ab effect @xcite . both phenomena take place in the absence of magnetic flux penetrating inside the ring , which is in complete contrast with the ordinary counterparts observed in untwisted quantum rings .",
    "further detailed analysis is performed to make clear similarities and differences between the phase shift behaviors of twisted and untwisted rings .",
    "the hamiltonian of a particle moving in a twisted system can be formulated via three different approaches .",
    "the first approach established by mitchell @xcite leads us to the hamiltonian that is applicable to arbitrary dimensional twisted systems .",
    "the second one , suggested by magarill and @xmath0ntin @xcite , assumes a quasi-1d system having a finite thickness .",
    "the thickness allows excitations of mobile electrons in the transverse direction .",
    "the last approach , which also assumes a quasi-1d system , is based on a simplification that electrons reside in the lowest energy eigenstate of the transversal motion @xcite .",
    "the last one applies to sufficiently thin quantum systems with internal torsion and is relatively simple rather than other two methods . in this section",
    ", we give a brief review of the last formulation based on which we will deduce the torsion - induced phase shift in a sufficiently thin twisted ring .",

    "such the tangential field plays a similar role to @xmath44 depicted in figure [ fig : fig2 ] , and therefore , it causes torsion - induced current flow and the conductance modulation in the twisted ring .",
    "it is also noteworthy that our results of the persistent current ( figure [ fig : fig4 ] ) and conductance oscillation ( figure [ fig : fig5 ] ) should be dependent on the ring s parameters : the ring s perimeter ( @xmath126 ) and its cross - sectional area ( characterized by @xmath64 ) are cases in point .",

    "in addition , if @xmath64 is too small , the cross - sectional area becomes so large and thus the system can be no longer considered as 1d , since quantum excitations in the transverse directions are allowed .",
    "the effect of thickness would be trivial if the ring were untwisted ; the amplitudes of the conductance @xcite and persistent current @xcite will increase , since the number of conducting channels increases and all the channels assume the same amount of phase shift .",
    "contrariwise , in a twisted ring with finite thickness , each conducting channel assumes different values of the phase shift @xcite .",
