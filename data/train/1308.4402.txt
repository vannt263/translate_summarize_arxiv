    "* ( g13 ) ) .    to understand the stability of satellites around planets in stips , we select 2-planet systems which are _ stable _ , while being _ as closely spaced as it is possible for two planets to be _ ( without being co - orbital ) .",
    "we add satellites to these systems and examine whether the stability boundary at @xmath10 is changed by the close planetary approaches .",
    "we neglect planetary obliquity and tides , as ( a ) their effects are strongest at small satellite semi - major axes , @xmath11 @xcite , while we anticipate corrections due to planetary perturbations will occur at large @xmath11 , and ( b ) such effects occur in the single - planet case as well as the 2-planet case , and we wish to focus on the differences caused by the additional planet . for small planetary semi - major axes and large satellite : planet mass ratios , tides can cause otherwise stable satellites to be lost from their parent planets _ within the age of the stellar system _ via inward and/or outward migration of satellites @xcite .",
    "any reduction in @xmath12 seen in our simulations will accelerate this tidal - driven loss of satellites .",
    "our numerical integrations ( of length @xmath13 ) use the same methodology as @xcite , i.e. using a symplectic integrator @xcite with corrector @xcite to evolve suites of initial conditions , while concurrently integrating the tangent equations @xcite .    at @xmath13 ,",

    "@xmath17 ) . energy conservation when close - encounters occur is significantly worse , but we do _ not _ follow the outcomes of such systems , instead we simply flag them as chaotic .",
    "our timesteps were chosen to be @xmath18 the shortest physical timescale in the problem @xcite : a timestep of @xmath19 days for planet - plus - satellite integrations having satellite periods down to @xmath20 day .",
    "we measure distances in terms of ( i ) the parent planet s hill radius , @xmath21 and ( ii ) the mutual hill radius of parent planet and perturbing planet , @xmath22 @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the semi - major axis and the mass - ratio with the central star .",
    "c    two - planet systems which are both stable and closely spaced experience repeated relatively close approaches between the two planets , which _ may _ destabilize some satellite orbits , while the planet themselves remain stable .",

    "the red line is the equation for the outermost stable satellite orbit , @xmath71 , given in domingos et al ( 2006 ) .",
    "this line corresponds well with the sharp transition from large lyapunov exponents ( light grays ) to the small lyapunov exponent chaotic region ( dark grays ) .    the chaotic curved feature between @xmath72 in fig .",
    "2 is due to the `` evection '' resonance @xcite , where the precession period of the satellite orbit equals the planetary orbital period .",
    "this demonstrates that ( i ) our code can reproduce previous results regarding satellite stability , and ( ii ) the lyapunov exponent provides a reliable measure of satellite stability .",
    "c +    [ fig:2 ]    we take sets ( @xmath73 , and @xmath42 ) and add a @xmath63-mass satellite to the circular outer planet at 1 au , with @xmath11 and @xmath70 drawn randomly from uniform distributions @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we integrate @xmath66 versions of each set for @xmath67 planetary orbits .",

    "since the planetary orbits are regular a small lyapunov time indicates a chaotic satellite orbit . n.b .",
    "2 , set @xmath42 has chaotic _ planets _ , so the lyapunov indicator provides a confusing mixture of information regarding chaos in both the planetary and satellite orbits .",
    "hence for set @xmath42 we simply plot ( in `` olive '' ) the initial orbital elements for the satellites that survive at the end of the simulation .    in sets",
    "@xmath74 , unstable orbits occur across much of parameter - space due to destabilizing close planet - planet approaches ( see  [ secn : causes ] ) as the entire planetary system destabilizes .",

    "2 remain stable .",
    "only satellites close to the standard stability boundary are destabilized . while different sets are each affected differently , we observe that the stability boundary changes from the single planet result ( @xmath76 ) to something approximating @xmath77 eqn .",
    "[ eqn : outer ] is intended to be _ extremely _ approximate and is not a `` fit '' to the data : both the slope and intercept of the equation for @xmath12 as a function of @xmath78 varies across the sets . a general version of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : outer ] which explicitly accounts for the perturbing planet s mass and orbital elements requires a much broader series of investigations than we can undertake in this letter .",
    "close to @xmath12 , many satellites remain bound at @xmath79 days , but have short lyapunov times indicative of chaos ( e.g. region @xmath80 in fig .",
    "2 ) ( this is similar to the behavior of many solar system irregular satellites : .    in fig 2 . there exists small stable `` islands '' at @xmath81 ( see region @xmath82 ) , hinting at possible resonances between satellite and planetary orbital periods .    an analytic approximation ( and extension to non - coplanar systems ) to the results of domingos et al 2006 ( d06 ) was made in donnison 2010 ( d10 ) , whose derivation required that both the mass ratio between star and planet - satellite , and semi - major axis ratio between planetary orbit and satellite orbit be large .",
    "the results of d10 agree with the prograde results of d06 , but fail significantly for the retrograde case .",
    "while the mass and semi - major axes of our _ single_-planet simulations satisfy the requirements of d10 , the planet - planet masses and separations in the 2-planet simulations do _ not _ , hence d10 s results do not apply and can not guide our understanding of the destabilization .",
    "c +    [ fig:3 ]    we plot in fig .",
    "3 the stability of _ retrograde _ orbits .",
    "the satellites in these retrograde simulations are generated as for the prograde simulations with the exception that @xmath11 is now drawn randomly from a uniform distribution @xmath83 .",
    "the 1-planet plus 1-(retrograde)-moon case is plotted at the top right , with the stability boundary @xmath84 , of d06 over - plotted in red .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with our results , although in the high - eccentricity regime that d06 did _ not _ explore , their fitted boundary slightly underestimates the stability region .",
    "the systems ( @xmath85-@xmath86 & @xmath42 ) , have slightly reduced satellite stability under the influence of a perturbing planet , compared to the single - planet case ( top - right ) .",
    "systems which experience close approaches @xmath87 ( @xmath88 & @xmath89 - for details of close approaches see fig . 5 ) are able to maintain retrograde moons out to beyond @xmath90 , albeit with some fraction of the cases becoming unbound .",
    "systems which experience close approaches @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) are only able to stably support moons out to @xmath93 .",
    "all of these stated boundary values are _ maximal _ , i.e. they refer to the @xmath94 case .",
    "higher eccentricities significantly reduce @xmath12 .",
    "c +    [ fig:4 ]    we plot in fig .",
    "4 comparisons of ( a ) the lyapunov exponent maps , and ( b ) maps of the close - approach distance ( between satellite and perturber ) in units of @xmath95 ;    we observe ( i ) a close correspondence between the lyapunov - exponent maps and the close - approach maps , demonstrating that the close - approaches between satellite and perturbing planet drive the chaos at the outer edges of the plots .",
    "( ii ) the `` islands of stability '' noted in fig .",
    "2 are associated with more distant approaches , possibly coincident with commensurabilities between satellite and perturber s orbital period .    in fig 5",
    "we plot the minimum separation observed between ( a ) the two planets _ without _ a satellite in the simulation ( top row ) ; ( b ) the two planets _ with _ a satellite present ( 2nd row ) ; ( c ) the satellite and the perturbing planet ( 3rd row ) ;    we see that : ( i ) in sets @xmath74 the addition of the satellite has caused close approaches between the _ planets _ ( 2nd row ) that were absent during the no - satellite integrations ( top row ) , and ( ii ) in sets ( @xmath96 ) , the planet - planet separations remain ( relatively ) large , while satellite - planet separations can become small .",
    "we plot ( 4th row of fig .",
    "5 ) the lyapunov exponent as a function of the minimum satellite - planet separation ( in hill radii ) , demonstrating that a critical close - approach distance is apparent in all of the stable systems ( @xmath75 ) , but that the value of this critical close - approach distance _ differs _ across the different sets in a _ non - trivial _ fashion .    at the bottom of fig .",
    "5 we plot the lyapunov exponent as a function of the ratio @xmath97 at the time of minimum recorded separation between satellite and perturber . when the perturbing planet comes closer to the satellite than @xmath98 the satellite s distance from its parent planet , the satellite becomes unstable .",
    "closer approaches than this lead to satellites being ejected on to planet - crossing orbits .",
    "they subsequently experience strong scattering , leading to extremely small minimum recorded close approaches with @xmath99 .",
    "we speculate that the velocity perturbations induced by the perturbing planet are sufficient to excite eccentricities that bring the satellite s apocenter beyond the stellar - induced stability boundary , leading to the destabilization of the planet .",
    "while the ratio of separations is important in determining the stability boundary , the transition from stability to instability happens gradually and at different values in the different systems .",
    "this study compliments that of gong et al .",
    "( 2013 ) whose work concerned the satellite stability in systems of three giant planets undergoing very close encounters leading to gross instability ( planetary ejections and mergers ) , while our study concerns the satellite stability in primarily _",
    "stable _ two planet systems , undergoing frequent but weak perturbations .",
    "a more comprehensive investigation is required to understand the dependence of @xmath12 on the close approach distance of the perturbing planet , but our results indicate that repeated weaker interactions do not destabilize moon orbits on short timescales .",
    "similarly , we defer for future work the study of the effects of non - coplanarity and possible resonances between the satellite and planetary periods .",
    "c +    [ fig:5 ]",
    "we numerically integrated four - body ( star , planet , planet , satellite ) systems to investigate the stability of satellites in planetary systems with tightly - packed inner planets , finding that :    * in the most closely - spaced systems investigated in sets @xmath100 , the addition of a lunar - mass satellite is sufficient to catastrophically destabilize many of the planetary systems . * in the majority of systems investigated ( sets @xmath75 ) , with period ratios @xmath101 , close approaches between planets occur with minimum separations @xmath102 mutual hill radii .",
    "such close encounters only slightly reduce the region of parameter - space over which _ prograde _",
    "satellites are stable , reducing the zero - eccentricity outer stability boundary from @xmath10 to @xmath103 . *",
    "_ retrograde _ satellites are similarly mildly affected , with planetary close approaches @xmath91 causing the stable parameter - space for satellites to be restricted to @xmath104 , while more distant planetary approaches leave the satellite stability zone broadly the same as in the single - planet case . * there is a critical close approach for destabilization , @xmath105 .    while further investigations may be valuable",
    ", the approximately coplanarity @xcite and equal size planets @xcite of the majority of stips suggests that the investigation presented here provides strong evidence that stips can generally offer a dynamically stable home for satellites and hence provide suitable targets for exo - moon detection campaigns .",
    "moreover , the stips in the kepler catalogue have wider separations ( in hill radii ) than the systems examined here , thus any disturbance to their satellite stability zone will be further reduced .",
    "we have demonstrated that multi - planet systems are not _ a priori _ poor candidates for hosting satellites .",
    "hence we suggest that future measurement of satellite occurrence rates in multi - planet systems versus single - planet systems could be used to constraint satellite formation and/or previous periods of strong dynamical interaction between planets .",
