    "the abelian nambu model ( anm ) was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe electrodynamics in a way similar to the construction of pion interactions in the nonlinear sigma model characterized by spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the understanding of pions as the goldstone bosons ( gb ) arising from such breaking motivated the possibility of looking at photons as the gb resulting from a spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking ( slsb ) .",
    "the anm is defined by the lagrangian density @xmath1plus the non - linear constraint @xmath2the vector @xmath3 signals the direction of the non - zero vacuum expectation value @xmath4 inducing the slsb .",
    "usually , one deals separately with the three characteristic cases dictated by the choice of the vector @xmath3 as time - like @xmath5 , space - like @xmath6 or light - like @xmath7 . here",
    "we consider only the first two options where a natural choice of independent degrees of freedom ( dof ) is the following@xmath8the solutions of the constraint ( [ nlc ] ) shown in eqs .",
    "( [ tl ] ) and ( [ sl ] ) make clear the symmetry breaking from @xmath9 to @xmath10 and from @xmath9 to @xmath11 in the time - like and space - like cases , respectively .",
    "each realization of the anm is defined by substituting the dependent variable into the standard lagrangian density for electrodynamics ( lanm1 ) .",
    "the calculation of some particular processes in perturbation theory demand a further expansion of the non linear terms in the resulting lagrangian density in powers of the combinations @xmath12 ( time - like case ) and @xmath13 ( space - like case ) .",
    "after the solutions ( [ tl ] ) and ( [ sl ] ) of the constraint are inserted in the lagrangian density ( [ lanm1 ] ) one ends up with a regular system having three dof per point in coordinate space , where the resulting equations of motion are different from maxwell s equations nambu - progr , urru - mont .",
    "nambu models have been further studied in relation to electrodynamics urru - mont , vent1,azatov - chkareuli and also have been generalized to the non - abelian @xcite and gravitational cases @xcite .",
    "quantum electrodynamics in the nonlinear gauge ( [ nlc ] ) is considered in refs .",
    "general conditions on how the gauge symmetries are recovered from models that involve slsb are worked out in refs .",
    "@xcite . in particular , the result obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite states that the dynamics of the anm guarantees the validity of the gauss law for all times , once the gauss law and current conservation are imposed as initial conditions . in this way , after demanding such initial conditions , the anm reduces to electrodynamics and current conservation remain valid for all times as the consequence of the restored gauge invariance .",
    "an alternative way of exploring the connection between gauge theories and models with slsb is by means of the so - called bumblebee models appearing in the study of possible observable violations of lorentz invariance colladay - kostelecky .",
    "these models introduce gb modes and depending on the explicit form of the theory they present additional massive modes and constraints .",
    "such models have been thoroughly investigated in relation to electrodynamics @xcite and gravity bluhm_3,bluhm_2,kos_pot , carroll .    in this work",
    "we consider the relation between the anm and standard qed from a perturbative perspective , paying attention to the gauge fixing procedure that is required in qed to study their equivalence .",
    "perturbative calculations in the anm show that , to the order considered ( tree level and one - loop diagrams ) , all slsb contributions to physical processes cancel out , yielding the same results as in standard qed nambu - progr , azatov - chkareuli .",
    "this feature has been interpreted by stating that the non - linear constraint ( [ nlc ] ) can be seen just as a gauge choice in qed , which would then explain why the two theories are equal .",
    "nevertheless , this statement requires some qualifications : ( i ) on one hand , the number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) of the anm is three , in such a way that the possible equivalence between both theories requires at least to specify some additional condition to cut this extra dof .",
    "( ii ) on the other hand , fixing the gauge in any gauge theory requires the introduction of ghost particles , via the brst procedure for example , which play a fundamental role as internal particles in calculating physical processes brst .",
    "thus , to show the proposed equivalence one would need to study their contributions .",
    "a possible decoupling of such ghosts is by no means clear , especially due to the non - linear character of the suggested gauge fixing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review some basic points of the perturbative calculation presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors introduce a convenient field redefinition @xmath14 , which allows to write the anm in terms of the gb modes only .",
    "this formulation serves as the benchmark for the comparison of the anm with qed .",
    "section 3 describes how the brst formalism fixes the gauge @xmath15 in qed , introducing the required faddeev - popov ghosts ( fpg ) .",
    "the resulting gauge fixed qed lagrangian density is then written in terms of the same field redefinition @xmath14 already introduced in section 2 . in this way , one can show that the feynman amplitudes for physical processes arising from the anm lagrangian density and those stemming form the gauge fixed qed lagrangian density differs only by the contributions from the feynman diagrams including the fpg interactions .",
    "the ghost propagator , together with the other feynman rules , is calculated in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 includes the general perturbative proof on how the ghosts decouple when qed is formulated in the gauge fixed lagrangian density found in section 3 . in section 6 we close with a summary , where we put together all the pieces which prove the perturbative equivalence between the two models .",
    "in this section , we summarize the approach of ref .",

    "the fields @xmath28 , satisfying ( [ nlc1 ] ) , define three dof that are orthogonal to the vacuum @xmath30 so that they describe the goldstone modes of the model .    since the anm is defined by solving a constraint involving four fields in terms of three dof and after substituting the solution in the electromagnetic sector of the model , it is enlightening to compare the two possibilities offered once we introduce the field @xmath28 , to appreciate the advantage of this redefinition . for the time - like case @xmath31 , the solution @xmath32 , together with the choice of @xmath33 as the independent variables is fully equivalent to set @xmath34 and recognize that @xmath35 .",
    "for the space - like case @xmath36 the choice of independent variables @xmath37 , together with the definition @xmath38 , corresponds to set @xmath39and @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the substitution of @xmath41 or @xmath42 into ( [ lsqed ] ) , according to the choices ( [ tl ] ) or ( [ sl ] ) , is equal to the introduction of the field redefinition ( [ changv ] ) with the proper choice of @xmath3 , which we can select at the end of the calculation .",

    "<S> after imposing current conservation together with the gauss law as initial conditions on the abelian nambu model , we prove that the resulting theory is equivalent to standard qed in the non - linear gauge @xmath0 , to all orders in perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> we show this by writing both models in terms of the same variables , which produce identical feynman rules for the interactions and propagators . </S>",
    "<S> a crucial point is to verify that the faddeev - popov ghosts arising from the gauge fixing procedure in the qed sector decouple to all orders . </S>",
    "<S> we verify this decoupling by following a method like that employed in yang - mills theories when investigating the behavior of axial gauges . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalence between the two theories supports the idea that gauge particles can be envisaged as the goldstone bosons originating from spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking . </S>"
