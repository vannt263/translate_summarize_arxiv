    "the idea that clusters might provide an independent probe of cosmological expansion took root following a series of non - radiative hydrodynamical simulations showing that the gas mass fraction , @xmath14 , in    the largest ( i.e. , @xmath15 kev ) dynamically relaxed clusters , remains approximately constant with redshift @xcite . here , @xmath16 is the mass of the intracluster medium and @xmath17 is the total mass of the cluster .",
    "these results followed seminal papers by sasaki @xcite and pen @xcite , who argued that the measurement of apparent evolution ( or non - evolution ) in @xmath6 could be used to examine the angular distance to these sources as a function of redshift .",
    "since then , several groups have pursued this line of work , compiling extensive catalogs of clusters suitable for such a study @xcite . in conjuction with this observational work ,",
    "more elaborate simulations , incorporating several key physical ingredients , such as radiative cooling and the dynamical impact of turbulence , have provided a more realistic assessment of the conditions and cluster size for which @xmath6 might in fact be expected to remain constant .    under the ( as yet unproven ) assumption that the baryonic to dark matter densities , @xmath18 , is independent of redshift at least out to @xmath7 , the geometry of the universe can be constrained in this way because the measured baryonic mass fraction depends on the assumed angular diameter distance to the source , which is used along with the inferred density to obtain @xmath16 .",
    "( this assumption may have to be modified if , and when , new physics beyond the standard model implies that baryons and/or dark matter may be created or annihilated with time since the big bang . ) the baryonic matter content of galaxy clusters is dominated by the x - ray emitting intracluster gas , whose mass exceeds that of optically luminous material by a factor @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the other contributions to the total baryon budget are expected to be very small .",
    "the emissivity of the x - ray emitting gas is proportional to the square of its density , so the gas mass profile in a cluster can be determined precisely from x - ray data . measuring @xmath17 is more difficult because it is often based on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in the gas , from which one may infer the depth of the gravitational potential required to maintain the density profile .",
    "thus , only dynamically relaxed systems can be used for this purpose .",
    "in addition , as we will consider in more detail below , one would expect a constant mass fraction only for the very massive clusters , with minimal impact from astrophysical factors , such as feedback and cooling .",
    "but though cosmological simulations suggest that under some circumstances @xmath6 should be invariant with redshift , we would only see this in the data if the underlying model used to interpret the measurements is the correct cosmology .",
    "so in principle one may carry out a comparative test between competing models to see which , if any , predicts a constant value of @xmath6 with changing @xmath1 .",
    "the caveat here is that the constancy of @xmath6 with redshift should be independent of the expansion dynamics .",
    "one would certainly be justified in expecting this if @xmath18 has not changed with @xmath1 . however , to use this feature as a cosmological tool , we have to believe that a sample of clusters exists for which @xmath6 is independent of which version of @xmath4cdm ( or other cosmology ) we are comparing with the data . for",
    "if the behavior of @xmath6 with redshift were different for different expansion rates , we could not be certain that @xmath6 should in fact remain constant .    in their high - resolution simulations ,",
    "kravtsov et al .",
    "@xcite incorporated the effects of radiative cooling and galaxy formation on the baryon fraction , including the impact on star formation , metal enrichment , and stellar feedback .",
    "these processes increase the total baryon fraction within scales as large as the virial radius , though it is within the cluster cores that baryon fractions larger than the universal value are seen .",
    "however , even with cooling , the cumulative baryon fraction is close to its universal value at radii @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is defined to be the radius within which the average cluster density is greater than its critical value by a factor @xmath22 at that redshift ( see equation  2.12 below ) .",
    "moreover , even though the baryon fraction may be different from its universal value at smaller radii , simulations such as this suggest that the total baryon fraction within the cluster virial radius does not evolve with time , regardless of whether or not cooling is included .",
    "simulations with even greater sophistication than these were carried out by ettori et al .",
    "@xcite , this time including also the effects of feedback through galactic winds and conduction .",
    "they found that the baryon fraction within a fixed overdensity increases slightly with redshift , though the impact at large cluster - centric distances ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) is nearly independent of the physics included in the calculations .",
    "more recently , planelles et al .",
    "@xcite updated these simulations by including feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei .",
    "they too found that the baryon fraction is nearly independent of the physical processes , and is characterized by a negligible redshift evolution , if the cluster mass @xmath24 at @xmath25 is @xmath26 . at smaller radii , @xmath27 ,",
    "its value slightly decreases , while its scatter increases by about a factor of 2 .",
    "as we shall see , the cluster catalogs currently available for this cosmological test differ in their assumed overdensity factor @xmath22 , so @xmath6 may not be uniformly constant with redshift from sample to sample .",
    "this is an important caveat to consider when weighing the results of model comparisons using different cluster catalogs . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the 3 largest samples , two of which assume @xmath28 @xcite , while the third adopts the value @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "up until now , the cluster gas mass fraction has been used to probe only the parameter space associated with the standard model of cosmology , @xmath4cdm .",
    "the reference model often used for this work assumes a spatially flat universe ( @xmath30 ) with a scaled matter density @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the matter density and @xmath33 is the critical density in terms of the hubble constant @xmath34 today , and a dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant with equation - of - state @xmath35 , in terms of its pressure @xmath36 and density @xmath37 .",
    "since these clusters lie at redshifts @xmath38 , where the contribution of radiation to the total energy density is below detectability , one can also assume that @xmath39 .",
    "in obvious notation , @xmath40 .",
    "but in recent years , evidence has been accumulating that @xmath4cdm is perhaps the empirical approximation to a more theoretically motivated frw cosmology known as the @xmath5 universe @xcite .",
    "( a somewhat pedagogical treament may be found in ref .",
    "the latter arises when one invokes birkhoff s theorem @xcite together with weyl s postulate @xcite , which lead to an identification of the hubble radius @xmath41 as another manifestation of the universe s gravitational horizon , @xmath42 , defined in terms of the misner - sharp mass @xmath43 contained within a proper spherical volume of radius @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "it must therefore itself be a proper distance @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the universal expansion factor and @xmath47 is an unchanging co - moving distance .",
    "this form of @xmath44 leads immediately to the condition that @xmath48 constant .",
    "thus , the @xmath5 universe expands at a constant rate .",
    "this cosmology should not be confused with the milne universe @xcite , which is empty and has negative spatial curvature ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the milne universe does not at all fit the cosmological data and was ruled out as a viable model long ago .",
    "instead , the @xmath5 universe is flat ( @xmath30 ) and predicts very simple , analytical forms for measurable quantities , such as the luminosity distance , @xmath50 and the redshift dependence of the hubble constant , @xmath51 we will provide a more detailed description of the differences between @xmath5 and @xmath4cdm in   3 below .    by now , the predictions of these two cosmologies have been compared to each other using many diverse tests and available data , including : the cosmic chronometers @xcite , the gamma - ray burst hubble diagram @xcite , the high-@xmath1 quasars @xcite , the angular correlation function of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite , and the high-@xmath1 galaxies @xcite , among others ( some not yet published ) .",
    "the consensus from all of this work appears to be that the @xmath5 universe is closer to the correct cosmology than @xmath4cdm is .    in this paper",
    ", we extend this comparative study even further , by now examining the role played by the @xmath52 universe in maintaining an approximately constant value of the cluster gas mass fraction in the redshift range @xmath7 . in  2 of this paper ,",
    "we briefly describe the basic theory behind this independent cosmological probe . in  3 , we discuss the assumptions necessary in both @xmath4cdm and @xmath5 to make this diagnostic meaningful for cosmology , and then assemble the most extensive catalogs now available in  4 .",
    "we carry out our direct comparison between @xmath4cdm and @xmath5 in  5 , and then discuss our results and place them in a proper context in  6 .",
    "the baryonic matter content of galaxy clusters is dominated by the x - ray - emitting intracluster gas predominantly via thermal bremsstrahlung @xcite .",
    "thus , for the spherical @xmath53-model profile @xcite , the gas mass @xmath54 within a radius @xmath55 derived from x - ray observations may be written @xmath56^{1/2 } \\left({3m_ec^2\\over 2\\pi k_b t_e}\\right)^{1/4}m_h\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & \\null&\\qquad\\qquad{1\\over [ \\bar{g}_b(t_e)]^{1/2}}\\,r_c^{3/2}\\,\\left[{i_m(r / r_c,\\beta)\\over i_l^{1/2}(r / r_c,\\beta)}\\right]\\left[l_x(<r)\\right]^{1/2}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the electron and hydrogen masses , respectively , @xmath59 is the hydrogen fraction by mass , @xmath60 is the ( electron ) gas temperature , @xmath61 is the gaunt factor , @xmath62 is the core radius , and @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "the chosen cosmology enters this expression in three ways : through the x - ray luminosity @xmath65 through the core radius @xmath66 and through the variable radius @xmath67 in terms of the observed angular size @xmath68 , the observed x - ray flux @xmath69 , and the luminosity ( @xmath70 ) and angular ( @xmath71 ) distances .",
    "some of the data we will examine below are based on observations of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) , for which @xmath16 depends on a different power of radius .",
    "for the sze objects , @xmath72 , instead of @xmath73 @xcite , which is applicable in all other cases : @xmath74 and since @xmath75 , we have @xmath76 at any given redshift @xmath1 .    under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and isothermality",
    "( @xmath77 constant ) , the total mass within radius @xmath55 is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the mean - molecular weight per particle and @xmath80 is the spatially - dependent electron number density .",
    "thus , one gets @xmath81 and therefore @xmath82    according to equation  ( 1.1 ) , the angular distance in these expressions takes on a very simple analytical form in the @xmath5 universe : @xmath83 the corresponding expression in @xmath4cdm is @xmath84 in this equation , @xmath85 represents the spatial curvature of the universe  appearing as a term proportional to the spatial curvature constant @xmath86 in the friedmann equation .",
    "in addition , @xmath87 is @xmath88 when @xmath89 and @xmath90 when @xmath91 . for a flat universe with @xmath92 , which is what we assume throughout this paper",
    ", this equation simplifies to the form @xmath93 times the integral .",
    "the conversion from one cosmology to another therefore reduces predominantly to an evaluation of equations  ( 2.10 ) and ( 2.11 ) .",
    "but before we move on to the cluster samples , and carry out this comparison , there is an additional ingredient one must incorporate into the calculation of @xmath6 , and this has to do with the measurement radius used to delimit the volume over which @xmath16 and @xmath17 are determined .",
    "this radius is selected by fixing the value of cluster overdensity , @xmath94 at its inferred redshift @xmath95 .",
    "often , @xmath22 is taken to be 2,500 ( as in refs .",
    "@xcite ; see next section ) , but not always .",
    "( this is one of several reasons why we can not combine all of the available samples to carry out a single fitting procedure .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , it is necessary to carry out the fitting for each individual compilation of sources .",
    "some discussion concerning which value is more trustworthy in measuring @xmath6 appears in refs .",
    "the third data set we are using @xcite assumes @xmath29 .",
    "so there is an additional dependence of @xmath6 on the background cosmology , beyond simply the factor appearing in equation  ( 2.9 ) , because @xmath27 ( or @xmath25 ) itself changes with the model .",
    "the reasoning behind this is rather simple to understand @xcite . on the one hand , we know that the total mass within @xmath27 is given by the expression @xmath96 .",
    "but since both @xmath60 and the density gradient in equation  ( 2.7 ) are approximately constant in the region of @xmath97 , the hydrostatic equilibrium equation gives @xmath98 ( see equation  2.8 ) .",
    "these two expressions should be equal , and since @xmath99 , we see that @xmath100 .",
    "thus , the angle spanned by @xmath27 at @xmath1 is @xmath101 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the slope of @xmath102 in the region of @xmath27 is @xmath103 over their sample range @xmath104 , for the reference @xmath4cdm model described in the introduction .",
    "therefore , since the angle subtended by @xmath27 changes with the cosmology , one expects that @xmath105 , over and above the primary dependence given in equation  ( 2.9 ) .",
    "this angular correction factor is close to unity for all cosmologies and redshifts of interest , but ought to be included for completeness .    given the strong dependence of the inferred values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 on the assumed cosmology , the data need to be recalibrated for each considered model .",
    "however , a procedure has been developed by the groups who analyze these clusters , in which the data are reduced once for the reference @xmath4cdm model , and then are fitted with modifications to the reference model based on its differences with the cosmology being tested .",
    "specifically , the model fitted to the reference @xmath4cdm data takes the form @xmath106^{\\lambda",
    "cdm}}\\right]^\\eta \\left[{d_a^{\\lambda cdm}(z)\\over d_a(z)}\\right]^{3/2}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is a constant that includes a parametrization of the residual uncertainty in the accuracy of the instrument calibration and x - ray modelling , and the factors in brackets represent the two principal dependencies described above , i.e. , on @xmath108 and @xmath109 . in this expression ,",
    "the variables with superscript @xmath4cdm have values corresponding to the reference @xmath4cdm model ( see  1 above ) , whereas the unlabeled parameters are those representing the new cosmological model being tested ( in this case , @xmath5 ) .",
    "sometimes , additional factors are added to this expression , e.g. , representing the possible contribution from nonthermal pressure support , the @xmath1 dependence of the baryonic mass fraction in stars , and a possible evolutionary depletion of the baryon fraction measured at @xmath27 as a consequence of the thermodynamic history of the gas @xcite .",
    "all these factors , however , appear to be very close to unity , and we will therefore not include them in our analysis .",
    "the appropriate spacetime to use in any cosmological model is conveniently and elegantly written in terms of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , though this does not tell us much about the cosmic equation of state ( eos ) , relating the total energy density @xmath110 to its total pressure @xmath111 .",
    "if the eos were known , the dynamical equations governing the universal expansion could be solved exactly , and the observations could then be interpreted unambiguously . unfortunately , we must rely on measurements and assumptions to pick @xmath110 and @xmath111 . at the very minimum",
    ", @xmath110 must contain matter @xmath112 and radiation @xmath113 , which we see directly , and an as yet poorly understand ` dark ' energy @xmath114 , whose presence is required by a broad range of data including the type ia supernova hubble diagram @xcite .",
    "however , as the measurements of the distance versus redshift continue to improve , they appear to be creating more tension between theory and observations , rather than providing us with a better indication of the dark - energy component , @xmath115 .",
    "for example , this is seen with the difficulty @xmath4cdm has in accounting for the growth and evolution of high-@xmath1 quasars @xcite and high-@xmath1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is also apparent from the @xmath116 disparity between the predictions of @xmath4cdm and the precise measurements using the alcock - paczynski test ( @xmath117 ) applied to galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "of the 3 measurements made to date , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , @xmath4cdm predicts @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "by contrast , @xmath5 provides a much better accounting of these data , with @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 . and",
    "as a third example , the best - fit value of @xmath127 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 measured by _ planck _",
    "@xcite is quite different from that ( @xmath128 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 ) inferred from low - redshift measurements , e.g. , using the type ia sn hubble diagram .",
    "@xmath4cdm assumes that dark energy is a cosmological constant @xmath4 with @xmath129 , and therefore @xmath130 .",
    "this model does quite well explaining many of the observations , but such a scenario is inadequate to explain all of the nuances seen in cosmic evolution and the growth of structure .",
    "for example , insofar as the cmb fluctuations measured with both wmap @xcite and _ planck _",
    "@xcite are concerned , there appears to be unresolvable tension between the predicted and measured angular correlation function @xcite .",
    "also , the observed galaxy distribution function appears to be scale - free , whereas the matter distribution expected in @xmath4cdm has a different form on different spatial scales .",
    "the fine tuning required to resolve this difference led watson et al .",
    "@xcite to characterize the galactic matter distribution function as a ` cosmic coincidence . ' ( we note , however , that the galaxy correlation function may be a poor indicator of the matter distribution itself , since the former depends on the still uncertain nature of galaxy formation , in addition to the underlying cosmology . )",
    "such difficulties are compounded by @xmath4cdm s predicted redshift - age relation , which does not appear to be consistent with the growth of quasars at high redshift @xcite , nor the very early appearance of galaxies at @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 universe is another frw cosmology that has much in common with @xmath4cdm , but includes an additional ingredient motivated by several theoretical and observational arguments @xcite . like @xmath4cdm",
    ", it also adopts the equation of state @xmath132 , with @xmath133 and @xmath134 , but goes one step further by specifying that @xmath135 at all times .",
    "one might come away with the impression that these two prescriptions for the equation of state can not be consistent .",
    "but in fact nature is telling us that if we ignore the constraint @xmath136 and instead proceed to optimize the parameters in @xmath4cdm by fitting the data , the resultant value of @xmath137 averaged over a hubble time is actually @xmath138 within the measurement errors @xcite .",
    "in other words , though @xmath130 in @xmath4cdm can not be equal to @xmath138 from one moment to the next , its value averaged over the age of the universe is equal to what it would have been in @xmath5 .",
    "this result does not necessarily prove that @xmath4cdm is an incomplete version of @xmath5 , but it does seem to suggest that the inclusion of the additional constraint @xmath136 might render its predictions closer to the data . in @xmath52 ,",
    "this condition on the total equation of state is required in order to maintain a constant expansion rate @xmath139 .",
    "thus , the principal difference between @xmath4cdm and @xmath5 is that , whereas one must first assume the constituents and their equations of state in @xmath4cdm and then infer its expansion rate , the universe s dynamics in @xmath5 is completely specified before one begins to speculate on its contents .    nonetheless , both @xmath4cdm and @xmath5 face similar limitations when it comes to the essential ingredients in the cosmic fluid , such as the nature of dark matter or dark energy . in @xmath4cdm , one of the most important assumptions",
    "is that @xmath18 is constant with redshift ( and therefore time ) .",
    "of course , the distribution of halos , and eventually galaxies and clusters , depends on the background expansion rate ( for a recent set of simulations , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the many calculations carried out to date suggest that the gas mass fraction in clusters is insensitive to the underlying cosmology .",
    "there is actually a good , sound reason for the relative insensitivity of the structure and content of a condensing halo to the choice of underlying cosmology .",
    "one may understand this basic outcome in the context of birkhoff s theorem and its corollary @xcite , according to which the spacetime inside of a spherical shell in an otherwise isotropic distribution of mass and energy is completely independent of the exterior region . because of spherical symmetry , all contributions to the spacetime curvature within this shell cancel completely .",
    "thus , once an overdense perturbation in the background density begins to be self - gravitating and forms a bound system , its subsequent evolution proceeds under its own gravity , independently of the surrounding medium , even in an infinite universe .",
    "the expansion rate exterior to the contracting halo therefore has little influence on the eventual structure and content of the collapsing region .",
    "all the simulations confirm this basic result  actually going even farther and showing that the inclusion of additional astrophysical effects , such as radiative cooling , have only a minimal impact on the results .    in other words , because of birkhoff s theorem , if @xmath6 is more or less constant in any one model , it is expected to be similarly constant in all cosmological models , but we would measure it to be independent of redshift only if the correct geometry were assumed in the data analysis . this is what makes it such a potentially powerful probe of the cosmology .",
    "insofar as the @xmath5 universe is concerned , detailed hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation do not yet exist .",
    "but because of birkhoff s theorem and the insensitivity of the halo evolution to the external expansion rate , we can already start to examine the possibility that @xmath6 may be constant in this cosmology as well , with more in - depth analysis to follow after comprehensive structure formation simulations will have been completed .    nonetheless , to make a model comparison viable , we need to consider several essential constraints . at the very minimum",
    ", the @xmath5 universe must also contain baryonic matter , radiation , dark matter , and some form of dark energy , though we already know that this could not be a cosmological constant .",
    "what we do know , however , is that no matter what these ingredients turn out to be , they must always partition themselves in such a way as to maintain the total equation of state @xmath140 .",
    "the idea that the internal chemisty of a system adjusts to macroscopic constraints is not uncommon .",
    "for example , we already have such a situation with @xmath4cdm , where the partitioning of baryonic matter and radiation in the early universe follows the prescribed redshift evolution in temperature @xmath141",
    ". moreover , since the existence of dark matter and dark energy presumably implies physics beyond the standard model , it s quite possible that this early partitioning of the constituents in @xmath4cdm involves other components , in addition to baryonic matter and radiation .",
    "recently , the validity of the @xmath5 model was questioned on the basis that its equation of state could not be consistent with the conservation of matter during the universe s expansion @xcite .",
    "this argument took the opposite approach to what we have just described , i.e. , it abandoned the equation of state @xmath140 and instead replaced it with a @xmath4cdm - like sum of the equations of state of individual constituents , but with the added proviso that matter could not be created or annihilated once it appeared on the scene .",
    "this begs the question of how matter could have been created in the first place , not to mention how such an unmotivated constraint could be consistent with what we believe happened with @xmath4cdm in the early universe , when matter and radiation ( and possibly other as yet unknown fields ) transformed back and forth into each other prior to , and subsequent to , the period of inflation .",
    "it s always interesting to explore the viability of such variants to the basic model , but one should not interpret their results as being meaningful to the @xmath5 universe , which does not incorporate the conservation of matter as one of its basic ingredients .",
    "the only condition essential to this cosmology is the total equation of state @xmath140 , which no doubt will impact how we interpret physics beyond the standard model .    in our recent analysis of the epoch of reionization @xcite ,",
    "we considered the possibility that the dark matter and baryonic densities might have evolved separately of each other at high redshifts , i.e. , @xmath142 .",
    "however , it is not clear whether such a trend might continue to lower redshifts .",
    "there is clearly much to learn from future developments in particle physics , for both @xmath4cdm and @xmath5 .",
    "but insofar as understanding the redshift dependence of the gas mass fraction @xmath6 is concerned , we will here make the simplest minimal assumption for both @xmath5 and @xmath4cdm , which is that the baryonic fraction @xmath18 remains approximately constant for @xmath7 .",
    "the results of this paper are contingent upon the validity of this assumption .",
    "in order to compare the predictions of the @xmath5 universe against those of the reference @xmath4cdm model , we consider three samples of galaxy clusters whose gas mass fractions have been measured using x - ray surface brightness observations .",
    "the laroque et al .",
    "sample @xcite consists of 38 massive clusters lying in the redshift range @xmath143 , and were obtained from _",
    "chandra _ x - ray and ovro / bima interferometric sunyaev - zeldovich effect measurements . in order to study the dependence of their analysis on the assumed model for the cluster gas distribution , taking into account the possible presence of a cooling flow , these authors considered three different models for the plasma profile : ( 1 ) an isothermal @xmath53-model fit jointly to the x - ray data at radii beyond 100 kpc and to all of the sze data , ( 2 ) a nonisothermal double @xmath53-model in hydrostatic equilibrium ,",
    "fit jointly to all of the x - ray and sze data , and ( 3 ) an isothermal @xmath53-model fit only to the sze spatial data . in this paper",
    ", we consider the results of models ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) only , since the number of clusters appropriate for the third case was noticeably smaller than the others .",
    "the single isothermal @xmath53-model with the central 100 kpc excised seemed to work quite well , since the cut was large enough to exclude the cooling region in cool - core clusters while keeping a sufficient number of photons to enable the mass modelling .",
    "the more sophisticated double-@xmath53 model was designed to take into account ( non - isothermal ) temperature profiles , and was developed to assess the biases arising from the isothermal assumption and the effects of core exclusion in the first model . as we will see in the next section , the fits suggest that both of these approaches work quite well , and provide mutually consistent results .    our second sample is taken from allen et al .",
    "@xcite , who compiled a catalog of 42 hot ( @xmath144 kev ) , x - ray luminous , dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters spanning the redshift range @xmath145 .",
    "their measurements were also based on _ chandra _ observations , and like ref .",
    "@xcite , these authors also adopted a canonical measurement radius of @xmath27 , whose value they determined directly from the _ chandra _ data .",
    "ten of these clusters are in common with a subset of the laroque sample , and there is good agreement for the best - fitting results in this sub - sample at @xmath27 between the two groups , though the mass fractions measured by laroque et al .",
    "are on average about @xmath146 percent higher than those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for the systems in common .",
    "the ettori et al .",
    "@xcite sample is the biggest of the three , containing 52 x - ray luminous galaxy clusters ( also observed with _",
    "chandra _ ) in the redshift range @xmath147 , merged with 8 additional objects at @xmath148 , with a gas temperature @xmath149 kev @xcite .",
    "note , however , that although the reference cosmology ( as described in  1 above ) is identical for all three samples , ref",
    ". @xcite decided to use an overdensity of 500 ( instead of 2,500 ) to define the outer radius of their mass determination region . strictly speaking ,",
    "this means that @xmath150 ( see equation  2.13 ) could be different from the value ( @xmath151 ) applied to the other two samples , but for the sake of simplicity , we will use the same value throughout our analysis . since this index is presumably much smaller than one , the impact of this approximation on our results is expected to be smaller than , e.g. , the errors on the sample means of the @xmath6 values .",
    "another technical difference among the samples is that both the allen et al .",
    "@xcite and ettori et al .",
    "@xcite measurements of the mass fraction @xmath6 are based strictly on the assumption of isothermality and hydrostatic equilibrium , in constrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , which considered both isothermal and nonisothermal models .",
    "such differences in the handling of the various samples precludes any possibility of merging them into a single , bigger sample , thereby improving the statistics . on the other hand",

    "ironically , the best - fit mean gas fractions that we have derived here ( for both @xmath4cdm and @xmath5 ) are comparable for the two values of @xmath22 used in the samples adopted in this paper , in spite of the expected radial dependence in @xmath6 .",
