    "diffusion - limited reactions have attracted much interest in recent years  @xcite .",
    "the kinetics of such systems is dominated by local fluctuations in the concentration of the reactants , thus posing a formidable problem which has not yet been solved : there exists no comprehensive theoretical approach for the analysis of diffusion - limited processes . in this state of affairs ,",
    "computer simulations provide a much needed input .",
    "a basic example is diffusion - limited two - species annihilation ,  @xcite .",
    "particles of two different species , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , diffuse and react immediately , and irreversibly , upon encounter .",
    "the product is assumed to be an inert species which does not affect the process in any significant way .",
    "when the two species diffuse with the same diffusion constant , and their initial concentrations are equal , the concentration ( of either species ) decays anomalously slow : @xmath3 , for space dimension @xmath4 . in @xmath5 ,",
    "local fluctuations cease to dominate and one obtains the ",
    "mean - field \" result of the reaction - limited case , @xmath6 . in low dimensions ,",
    "the process is slowed down because of the formation of domains consisting of particles of only one of the species .",
    "these domains grow with time , and various length scales characteristic of their geometry are then of interest .",
    "surprisingly , when a drift field is imposed , i.e. , when the particles hop preferentially in a certain direction , the kinetics is altered dramatically  @xcite .",
    "for example , in one dimension one finds that @xmath7 , instead of @xmath8 without drift  @xcite . the anomalous behavior , and the difference between drift and no drift is most pronounced in @xmath9 , and we shall henceforth restrict ourselves to this case .",
    "the kinetics of two - species annihilation with drift is not as well understood as without drift .",
    "while everybody agrees on the long time asymptotic decay of the concentration , @xmath10  @xcite , other behavior is controversial : ispolatov ,  @xcite propose that the typical domain size grows as @xmath11 with @xmath12 , and that there is a correction to the concentration decay , of the form @xmath13 , with @xmath14 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 are constants ) . on the other hand",
    ", janowsky  @xcite argues that the domain growth exponent is @xmath15 . comparing this with the superdiffusive length scale @xmath16 , which naturally arises in diffusion with drift and hard core interaction  @xcite , one obtains the correction exponent @xmath17 .",
    "janowsky also predicts that the typical distance between domains grows as @xmath18 , similar to the process without diffusion .",
    "these small disagreements could not be resolved by the computer simulation data presented at the time . here",
    "we report on large scale simulations of  with drift , using the method of renormalized reaction - cells ( rrc )  @xcite .",
    "this technique has enabled us to simulate the process in one - dimensional lattices of up to @xmath19 sites , to completion , until there are no particles left .",
    "the results confirm the concentration decay of @xmath10 , and strongly support the exponents and corrections to scaling predicted by janowsky .",
    "the two - species annihilation process is modeled as follows .",
    "the sites of a one - dimensional lattice are either empty or occupied by a single @xmath1 or @xmath2 particle .",
    "( periodic boundary conditions are imposed , so the lattice is effectively a ring . )",
    "the particles undergo diffusion under extreme drift conditions : at each monte carlo step a particle is chosen randomly and is moved to the nearest site to its right .",
    "diffusion results because of the random order of the updates .",
    "if the target site is occupied by a particle of the opposite species , then both particles are removed from the system , mimicking the reaction . on the other hand ,",
    "if the target site is occupied by a particle of the same species , then the move is disallowed and it does not take place . this implements the excluded volume interaction between like particles , without which drift has no significant effect on the kinetics .",
    "regardless of the outcome , time is incremented by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the total number of particles remaining in the system .",
    "thus , in one unit time , all of the particles move ( or attempt to move ) once , on average .    as the simulation proceeds , the particle concentration declines and the typical distance between particles increases .",
    "the time spent on simulating the diffusive motion of the particles until they interact grows even faster , as the square of the distance between them .",
    "because of that , computer simulations are limited to relatively short times .",
    "this problem is overcome by the rrc method  @xcite , which we have adapted for the case of  with drift .    in our implementation of the rrc method",
    "the particles occupy cells , rather than sites",
    ". each cell may be either empty , or occupied by one or more particles of only one species .",
    "whenever the overall concentration drops by half , the lattice undergoes a renormalization process .",
    "every two adjacent cells are merged into a new cell : cells @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the old lattice are combined into a new cell , @xmath24 , in the new lattice .",
    "the contents of cell @xmath24 is the combined contents of the two parent cells , @xmath22 and @xmath23 : suppose that the number of particles in the parent cells is @xmath25 and @xmath26 , then , if the particles in both cells are of the same species , there would be @xmath27 particles of that same species in @xmath24 .",
    "otherwise , the annihilation reaction takes effect and @xmath24 contains @xmath28 particles of that species that was initially in the majority .",
    "the particles hop from one cell to the next in a single monte carlo step , and because the cells keep growing the diffusion process is greatly sped up : in order to diffuse out of a renormalized cell twice as large as that of the previous generation , a particle requires a time longer by a factor of four .",
    "thus , physical time is simulated faster with each renormalization step .",
    "a monte carlo step consists of selecting a _ non - empty _ cell at random and moving a particle from within it to the adjacent cell to its right .",
    "the move is allowed only if the target cell is empty , or if it contains particles of the opposite species .",
    "the number of particles in the cell of origin decreases by one ; the number of particles in the target cell increases by one , if it was initially empty , or decreases by one , if it contained particles of the opposite species .",
    "note , however , the following objections : ( 1 )  different cells contain different numbers of particles , so the more populated cells should be selected more often .",
    "( 2 )  the excluded volume interaction seems not to be fully accounted for , since cells may contain more than one particle .",
    "we will now see how both problems may be elegantly addressed , by carefully tuning the time update associated with each monte carlo step .",
    "let @xmath29 be the maximum number of particles present at any given cell in the system at time @xmath30 . to make the total rate of all possible processes within each non - empty cell equal , assume that cells with @xmath31 particles contain also @xmath32 `` ghost '' particles .",
    "the ghost particles require the same time to hop ( or to attempt a hop ) just as real particles do , but their presence has no other effect .",
    "each occupied cell now contains a total of @xmath33 particles and the total rates are equal .",
    "the time increment associated with a monte carlo step should be @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of renormalizations since the start of the run , and @xmath36 is the current number of occupied cells . to take the excluded volume effect within a cell into account , we assume that only the rightmost ( real ) particle may attempt a hop to the adjacent cell on the right , for only it is unimpeded by the presence of the other ( real ) particles in the cell . but",
    "the probability that the rightmost particle is selected for the attempt is @xmath37 .",
    "instead , we can assume that the rightmost particle has been selected , with probability one , but that a longer time has elapsed , on average , by a factor of @xmath33 : @xmath38 .",
    "algorithmically , then , there is no need to worry about ghost particles , nor about the actual value of @xmath33 .",
    "one simply selects one of the @xmath39 cells at random and executes the monte carlo step , then increments time by @xmath40 .    as a final observation",
    "we note that because the concentration keeps roughly constant throughout the simulation , it may be desirable to work with low initial concentrations .",
    "otherwise , particles are typically separated by but a few cells , and one should worry about the effect of such coarseness on the results .",
    "also , a low concentration reduces the fraction of cells with more than one particle , thus minimizing concerns about the approximate treatment of the excluded volume interaction within multiply occupied cells .",
    "we have found satisfactory results with initial concentrations of @xmath41 ( of the two species combined ) , and we have used this value for all of the simulation results reported below .",
    "our first goal is to convince ourselves of the reliability of the rrc method . to this end , we have simulated the  process on lattices of @xmath42 sites , in both the rrc and the traditional simulation method .",
    "these lattices are small enough to enable the simulation of the process by the traditional method to completion , thus providing a benchmark test throughout all its three stages : ( 1 )  the initial phase , until particles diffuse across the distance separating each other and start reacting in mass ( this takes of the order of @xmath43 ) , ( 2 )  the main phase , characterized by the @xmath44 decay , and typical of infinite systems , and ( 3 )  the end phase , where finite - size effects kick in and the decay speeds up to exponential rate . on the other hand , the system is large enough to let us examine the effect of the renormalizations : with @xmath45 sites and @xmath46 the rrc method requires @xmath47 renormalizations . in fig .",
    "1 we compare the particle concentration as obtained by the two methods .",
    "the agreement is very good , and there are no discernible anomalies associated with the renormalizations .",
    "the agreement is also as good for other quantities measured , such as the domain size and the distance between domains .",
    "having gained some confidence in the rrc method , we proceeded to perform larger simulations . in fig .",
    "2a we show the surviving number of particles , @xmath21 , at time @xmath30 , for a system of @xmath19 sites . the initial number of particles is close to @xmath48 , and the process has been simulated to completion , after about @xmath49 time units .",
    "( recall that in one unit of time all the particles in the system attempt one move , on average . ) in comparison , other simulations to date  @xcite have been carried on lattices of @xmath50 to @xmath51 sites , and up to @xmath52 to @xmath53 time units .",
    "the three stages of the process are clearly visible in fig .  2a , but here the main phase alone spans nearly ten orders of magnitude . in fig .",
    "2b we show the local slopes of the plot in part  ( a ) .",
    "it can be seen that the approach to the predicted value , @xmath54 , is extremely slow .",
    "corrections to scaling are sizable even after very long times .",
    "we return to the issue of corrections later on .",
    "next we look at the inter - domain distance , @xmath55  the distance between the last particle in a domain and the first particle in the domain next to it .",
    "the growth predicted by janowsky , of @xmath18 , seems to hold true throughout the main phase . towards the end of the process",
    ", the inter - domain distance grows somewhat faster ( fig .",
    "the first quantity under dispute is the scaling of the domain length . in fig .",
    "4 we show a log - log plot of the average domain length , @xmath56 , as a function of time .",
    "slopes of @xmath57 ( ispolatov ) and @xmath58 ( janowsky ) are shown for comparison .",
    "while the results of this figure seem to favor the scaling proposed by janowsky , they are not convincingly conclusive . for additional evidence",
    ", we turn to the following simple - minded scaling analysis .",
    "we argue that the particle concentration scales as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the domain growth exponent , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the lattice size .",
    "we simply assume that the typical domain size is the fastest growing length scale in the system .",
    "( this is in agreement with all theoretical predictions . )",
    "the proposed scaling form reflects our expectation that the concentration decay throughout the main and the final phases of the process be a function of @xmath63 . on the other hand , for infinitely large lattices",
    "the @xmath62 dependence ought to disappear and one expects the pure power - law behavior @xmath64 .",
    "this can only be if @xmath65 , for @xmath66 , and the prefactor of @xmath67 is necessary to eliminate the dependence on @xmath62 . in fig .",
    "5 , we plot @xmath68 as a function of @xmath69 for different lattice sizes and for @xmath12 and @xmath58 .",
    "the data collapse , in particular near the end of the process , is clearly better for @xmath15 .",
    "finally , let us address the issue of corrections to scaling of the concentration decay . according to ispolatov ,  @xcite",
    "the corrections are of the form @xmath70 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are constants , and the correction exponent is @xmath14 .",
    "this results from a comparison of the domain growth as predicted by an inviscid ( @xmath16 ) vs.  a viscid ( @xmath71 ) burgers equation .",
    "according to janowsky  @xcite , the superdiffusive length @xmath72 still plays the principal role in determining the concentration decay , however , in his case the predicted domain growth of @xmath73 provides a stronger correction than the viscid limit considered by ispolatov .",
    "hence , one should expect @xmath17 rather than @xmath74 .",
    "our strategy consists of performing a least squares linear fit of @xmath75 to @xmath76 , for different powers @xmath77 , and searching for the value of @xmath77 which minimizes the error .",
    "the asymptotic form  ( 2 ) is expected to work only in the main phase , and the sticky part of our procedure is deciding which times demarcate this region . by choosing different regions between @xmath78 and @xmath79 in the data for @xmath0-site lattices ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath80 , in good agreement with @xmath17 , and excluding , quite confidently , the possibility of @xmath14 . in fig .",
    "6a we show best fits for the region @xmath78 ",
    "@xmath81 , where our data is most reliable .",
    "it can be clearly seen that @xmath17 provides a much better fit than @xmath14 . in fig .",
    "6b we show how the same parameters ( for @xmath14 ) compare to the data at all times .",
    "the fit is reasonably good throughout all of the main phase .",
    "we have presented large scale simulation results of diffusion - limited two - species annihilation , , with drift , in one dimension , using the rrc method .",
    "our simulations are large enough to resolve an existing dispute about the rate of domain growth , and about the corrections to scaling of the concentration decay .",
    "two different length scales are associated with a diffusing particle subject to drift , and so it is not obvious _ a priori _ that the rrc method should be successful in such cases , for the renormalization step can account for only one of the two scales .",
    "we conclude that the rrc method is capable of handling reaction - diffusion systems with drift , and that the relevant length scale  the one used in the renormalization step  is the diffusive length .",
    "we note that the rrc method is easily generalized to other reactions and to higher dimensions .",
    "reactions with drift pose a more challenging theoretical problem than reactions without drift , and we anticipate that computer simulations , including the rrc method , will continue to be an important tool in their research in years to come .",
