    "<S> the existence of numerous families of mds subsystem codes is established . </S>",
    "<S> propagation rules are derived that allow one to obtain longer and shorter subsystem codes from given subsystem codes . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , propagation rules are derived that allow one to construct a new subsystem code by combining two given subsystem codes . </S>"
