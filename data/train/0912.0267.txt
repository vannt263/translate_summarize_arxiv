    "chiral matter comes in three generations . the simplest hypotheses of electroweak symmetry breaking and fermion mass generation assumes the existence of one higgs boson in the case of the standard model and a pair of higgs bosons in the case of supersymmetry .",
    "we ask here what the consequences are of having more generations of higgs bosons in analogy to fermion matter content .",
    "we are not the first to ask this question and investigate answers ( see for eg .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite to be highlighted later ) . some of our discussion will be known to readers , but that is only to set the stage for describing further material we have developed and in particular detailing large hadron collider ( lhc ) implications for next generation higgs boson ideas that survive scrutiny .",
    "the question is of increased interest of late for two reasons .",
    "one , the lhc begins soon and enters the prime real estate of higgs boson phenomenology , and we should be prepared to discover all reasonable and viable ideas .",
    "the physical particle spectrum of the higgs sector , if it exists , is speculation at present .",
    "investigating various scenarios that may yield phenomenology that is different from the simplest standard model ( sm ) approach is needed in order to develop more interpretive power over the data when it comes .    a second reason to consider a next generation of higgs bosons is from recent developments in string phenomenology .",
    "some approaches to particle physics model building from string theory suggest that further copies of higgs bosons may be generic among solutions .",
    "for example , in the work of  @xcite a second higgs generation is generic among the heterotic vacua , and may even be more copious than single generation higgs boson theories .",
    "it is also typical in this approach that there is a selection rule that allows only the first generation of higgs bosons to couple to the fermions .",
    "we will review later why this aspect is very helpful for the viability of a next generation of higgs bosons .",
    "next generation higgs bosons are motivated in other theories as well .",
    "for example , in theories with branes at singularities bifundamental states come from the same quivers , and multiplicities of higgs pairs are generic just like multiplicities of other representations . in intersecting @xmath2-brane theories ,",
    "the chiral content is constrained by topological intersection numbers , but the vector - like states can be many - fold . usually only our self - imposed restrictions in seeking solutions results in one generation . in heterotic orbifold models exotics are generic .",
    "restrictions to three families of fermions rarely necessarily restricts higgs bosons to one pair .",
    "some approaches , such as @xmath3 orbifolds with two wilson lines  @xcite , naturally provide three generations of higgs bosons , for example .",
    "most physicists nowadays carry the vague suspicions that additional higgs bosons are disastrous unless introduced into very restricted frameworks .",
    "they give the photon a mass , or result in unacceptable tree - level flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "this is to a large degree correct , but there are interesting viable limiting cases , touched on above , that are supported by theory model building .",
    "we set out to elucidate some general conditions for the viability of next generation higgs bosons .",
    "we detail a formalism for the analysis , including determining the mass matrices and mixing angles in both the sm and supersymmetry .",
    "this culminates in a study of a key process at the lhc that is signal for next generation higgs bosons .",
    "let us begin by considering an extra higgs doublet @xmath4 that is added to the sm higgs doublet @xmath5 .",
    "the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of each are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , subject to the condition that @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that both higgs doublets couple to the sm fermions . from these two doublets ,",
    "three degrees of freedom are eaten and become longitudinal components of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and five degrees of freedom are left : the scalar mass eigenstates @xmath11 , the pseudoscalar @xmath12 , and the charged higgs bosons @xmath13 .",
    "it is always possible to write the yukawa lagrangian terms as , _ y & = & _ ij|q_il _ vev u_jr+_ij|q_il _ vev d_jr+_ij|l_il _",

    ". where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are mass eigenstates of leptons , up type and down type quarks and @xmath17 are _ a priori _ arbitrary .",
    "the definition of @xmath18 is the linear combination that contains the full vev , _",
    "vev=_extra+_sm ,  and _ = _ sm-_extra is the perpendicular state with no vev associated to it . in general",
    ", there is nothing to forbid the off - diagonal elements of @xmath19 from being @xmath20 .",
    "this is the origin of the tree - level flavor changing neutral curent ( fcnc ) problem of extra higgs bosons .    to estimate the experimental upper bound on the off diagonal elements of @xmath17",
    "let us assume that the matrices @xmath21 are real and symmetric .",
    "we then obtain the following feynman rules for the scalar and pseudoscalar mass eigenstates ( the vertex factor being @xmath22 times the expressions below ) , h|u_iu_j , h|d_id_j & = & c_ _",

    "@xcite the final state @xmath79 has been considered while in ref .  @xcite the final state @xmath80 has been considered ) .",

    "only the process @xmath81 contributes to the cross section in these cases .    to get the cross section we expect the detectors to effectively measure we must multiply by the efficiency of reconstruction of a lepton pair and that of four jets .",
    "these efficiencies depend on kinematical quantities like @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we take an average value 0.8 for lepton pair reconstruction efficiency ( see pgs .  72 - 92 , pgs .  210 - 223 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and 0.9 for reconstruction efficiency of a jet ( see pgs .  286 - 287 in ref .",
    "we also require that at least three of the jets are @xmath70-tagged which gives an overall @xmath70-tagging efficiency equal to @xmath84 where the @xmath70-tagging efficiency for single jet @xmath85  @xcite .",
    "putting it all together we get , ^eff=0.16  .",
    "[ eff ] this equation is applicable for both the cross section and the background .",
    "the effective signal and background cross sections also appear in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "we have not computed the contribution due to mistagging of @xmath86-jets or other light jets .",
    "this will decrease the signal significance somewhat as mistagging is expected to have an appreciable contribution only to the sm background and not the signal .",
    "this is because the signal cross section is proportional to the square of the branching ratio of @xmath49 to the mistagged quarks but the branching ratio of @xmath49 to quarks other than @xmath70-quarks is much smaller . in ref .",
    "@xcite the signal and background cross sections for the process @xmath87 have been computed including mistagging effects .",
    "a rough estimate of the cross sections they obtain can be made from fig .  5 in their paper .",
    "such an estimate shows that the background cross section they obtain due to mistagged quarks is about a third of the contribution due to correctly tagged @xmath70 quarks .",
    "this mistag background is highly dependent upon the details of detector performance issues that will be sorted out in the course of the lhc runs .",
    "we do not expect the addition of these backgrounds to substantively change the discovery capability that we have presented , especially since they are unlikely to peak at the higgs mass @xmath88 in the di - jet invariant mass spectrum .",
    "in conclusion , we have argued that next generation higgs bosons should be viewed as generic possibilities in string theory model building , and illustrated this viewpoint with recent developments in string phenomenology .",
    "we presented a generalized theorem for the structure of higgs couplings to sm fermions that automatically avoids problematic tree - level flavor changing neutral currents that are induced by new higgs boson exchanges .",
    "our viewpoint is that the interaction rules of this theorem are too restrictive to be satisfied without a principle . in the case of the two - higgs doublet model of supersymmetry , the principle is holomorphy .",
    "additional higgs bosons added in any other context , such as more higgs doublet pairs in supersymmetry or simply another higgs boson in the sm , requires a strong discrete symmetry or selection rule .",
    "this can be contemplated within effective field theories , for example by @xmath89 @xmath90 symmetry , or within string theory by algebraic selection rules that may not totally forbid the unwanted couplings but can approximate zero , as was the case in the work of  @xcite .",
    "next we considered various constraints that these theories must face .",
    "for example , although tree - level flavor changing neutral currents induced by neutral higgs exchanges may be satisfied , loop - level ones induced by the charged higgs boson may not be .",
    "the @xmath0 transition is quite constraining to exotic higgses that get large vacuum expectation values , since they steal vev from the higgs that couples to fermions , thereby raising those fermion yukawa coupling magnitudes to dangerous levels .",
    "even normal cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixings can create too - large amplitude shift in that case compared to what experiment allows , and therefore the parameter space is not completely open and limits are derived on the exotic higgs vev as a function of the charged higgs boson mass .",
    "we computed the spectrum of higgs boson states with a next generation in the supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric context .",
    "within supersymmetry we showed that there is the prospect of slightly raising the tree - level cp even higgs boson mass with respect to the mssm in the smaller @xmath91 region .",
    "the effects are largest when the next generation higgs boson has a large vacuum expectation value .",
    "the large yukawa couplings that are present when an exotic , fermiophobic higgs doublet takes a large vev can alter the domain of perturbativity of the theory .",
    "we showed both in the sm context and the supersymmetry context that the top quark yukawa coupling could develop a landau pole well below the planck scale",
    ". a low - scale landau pole would preclude the existence of a perturbative theory description of unification at the high scale , and these results must be taken into account when considering a next generation of higgs bosons .    finally , we investigated the phenomenology of the exotic higgs sectors at the lhc .",
    "multi - higgs boson phenomenology within supersymmetry is a mature topic ; however , the fermiophobic next generation higgs boson layer to the theory has not been considered in depth .",
    "the salient new features are similar to sm phenomenology with an additional fermiophobic higgs doublet .",
    "thus , we discussed collider physics possibilities within that less complex framework .",
    "a particularly interesting possibility is the production of @xmath92 at the lhc , followed by @xmath93 .",
    "assuming @xmath49 is rather light , say less than @xmath94 , we can expect the largest branching fraction of @xmath49 decays to be to @xmath95 . for good distinction from background we can also demand the @xmath64 decay to leptons @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the signal becomes @xmath97 .",
    "background becomes particularly limited when we require at least three @xmath70-quark tags and that the four jets reconstruct two equal mass resonances .",
    "we propose that as a search strategy for this case , and show that there are good prospects for the lhc to find this signal .",
    "discovery would be an indication of next generation higgs bosons .    *",
