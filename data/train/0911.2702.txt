    "first , the recent synthesis of a ` star lattice ' organic iron acetate quantum magnet @xcite raises the possibility that a @xmath14 variant may possibly be synthesized in the near future and our results should be applicable to such systems .",
    "second , this lattice has a sufficiently different geometry from more commonly studied quantum magnets  it may be viewed either as a variant of the kagome lattice or as a decorated honeycomb lattice  which allows us to explore the effect of this new lattice geometry on possible spin liquid physics and valence bond solid phases in quasi-2d systems .    motivated by interpolating between this spin-1/2 su(2 ) model and an su(n ) generalization at large n which permits a mean field solution with fermionic spinon excitations,@xcite we examine a large number of interesting u(1 ) spin liquids as candidate ground states of the nearest neighbor @xmath14 heisenberg model on the 2d star lattice . guided by earlier work on the kagome lattice,@xcite we focus on spin liquid states denoted by sl@xmath17 $ ] where @xmath18,@xmath19 , and @xmath20 denote , respectively , the  fictitious \" fluxes seen by the fermionic spinons as they move around an elementary plaquette of the lattice : an up triangular plaquette @xmath21 , a down triangular plaquette @xmath22 , or the @xmath23-site dodecagon plaquette . in terms of the original spin variable , the fluxes on the triangular plaquettes correspond to scalar spin chiralities of the form @xmath24 , while @xmath20 is related to an operator defined by the twelve spins around the dodecagon loop . depending on the flux values , these spin liquids represent gapped chiral spin liquids which break time - reversal symmetry,@xcite or states with gapless fermi surfaces of spinons , or gapped spin liquids with no broken symmetries .    from a study of energetics of various flux values using gutzwiller projected wave function numerics for the physical case of @xmath25 ,",
    "we show that a particular gapped spin liquid , which we denote as sl@xmath26 $ ] , which does not break lattice or time - reversal symmetries emerges as a favorable candidate over a wide range of @xmath16 .",
    "this is in striking contrast to earlier work on the kagome lattice from two perspectives .",
    "first , as we show , the effect of projection is far more dramatic on the star lattice when compared with the kagome lattice ; a numerical gutzwiller projection of the mean field states leads to a complete reordering of the energies of the candidate spin liquids .",
    "second , unlike the kagome lattice case where the lowest energy variational state of this form is a spin liquid with massless dirac fermion excitations,@xcite the sl@xmath26 $ ] is a gapped u(1 ) spin liquid  we therefore know that it is ultimately unstable towards spinon confinement at low energies@xcite unlike the dirac fermion states whose stability depends on the number of fermion flavors @xmath27.@xcite    we find that the sl@xmath26 $ ] state naturally forms strong dimers on the ` expanded bonds ' for small values of @xmath16 thus leading to a confined state , a @xmath5-dimer vbs , which respects all symmetries of the hamiltonian.@xcite for large @xmath16 , numerical exact diagonalization ( ed ) studies of this model carried out in a restricted nearest - neighbor dimer basis showed signatures of @xmath0 ordering.@xcite we argue that another motivation to study possible dimer orders that break lattice symmetries is that such ordering often appear quite naturally in the large - n fermionic su(n ) theory as recognized in the early work of affleck and marston@xcite and shown in various other models studied recently.@xcite inspired by these results , we consider various candidate vbs phases from different perspectives  a large - n route , a bond operator formalism , and gutzwiller projected wave function numerics .",
    "all of these point to a transition to a @xmath0 ordered vbs phase for large enough @xmath28 , leading us to the phase diagram shown in fig .  1 .",
    "our result is in broad agreement with the ed study although the transition point estimated from our work is somewhat larger than the exact diagonalization ( ed ) result which yields @xmath29 ; the ed result may , however , may suffer from significant finite size effects .",
    "we then discuss possible routes by which the sl@xmath26 $ ] state might be unstable towards such @xmath0 vbs order instead of the @xmath5-dimer vbs .",
    "we present results for the triplon dispersion in both vbs states which can be tested in inelastic neutron scattering experiments on candidate materials .",
    "finally , although the various other interesting spin liquids we study do not appear to be energetically viable ground states for the nearest neighbor heisenberg model on the star lattice , they have energies which are close to the ground state .",
    "they might thus be stabilized as ground states by small changes in the hamiltonian , such as further neighbor exchange or spin - phonon coupling , or they might be relevant to understanding the intermediate energy scale properties or finite temperature physics of materials which realize this model .",
    "we therefore elucidate some of the properties of these spin liquid states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin , in section [ sec : meanfield ] by formulating the mean field theory of the heisenberg model on this lattice in a slave particle description using fermionic spinons which we relate to a large - n su(n ) approach . based on this , we classify and study the physical properties of a number of candidate spin liquid ansatzes .",

    "[ sec : dimer ] .",
    "as shown in the previous studies about the spin liquid phases on the square@xcite and kagome@xcite lattices , the inclusion of additional spin interactions can change the relative energetics of different spin liquid phases .",

    "there is a flat band lying on the fermi energy which is touching another dispersive band at the zone center , @xmath78 .",
