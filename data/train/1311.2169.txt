    "many organisms collectively gather resources for survival . for a lone animal looking for sources of food , the foraging efficiency",
    "is decided by its searching strategy and the distribution of the targets @xcite . however , when others are around the interactions between them may become important in determining the behaviour of the group as a whole .",
    "for example , an animal which is unsuccessful in locating food by searching on its own , can instead locate other distant members who are successful and join them .",
    "such behaviour is well documented across different species @xcite .",
    "however , what would be the ideal nature of such interaction being most advantageous for the group ? traditionally , this problem has been studied in behavioural ecology under the paradigms of information sharing and producer - scrounger games @xcite .",
    "the information sharing theory , in its canonical form , considers foragers simultaneously searching for food as well as looking for opportunities to join others . in the producer - scrounger games the simultaneous execution of the above activities is not possible .    with the advancement of different data logging techniques in animal experiments",
    "@xcite it has been possible to record the trajectories of animals searching for food .",
    "the information from such experiments have allowed for detailed statistical analysis and have helped in shedding light on the possible relationship between movement patterns and efficiency of search .",
    "the emergence of heavy tails in the walk - length distributions have prompted physicists to explain the foraging movement of animals in terms of lvy walks and flights @xcite .",
    "such motion of foragers for specific distribution of the resources is supposed to optimize the rates of the encounters with food items @xcite .    in general , the success with which a group forages and the observed patterns in the movement of foragers depends on several factors like , the ratio of the amount of resources available to the number of foragers , the nature of forager - forager interaction , the nature of distribution of resources , forager - target interaction and the strategy adopted by foragers .",
    "several field studies and theoretical models have investigated the importance of one or more of these factors .",
    "the producer - scrounger paradigm was used to model the collective behaviour of foragers @xcite .",
    "cooperation in foraging was shown to develop in a stochastic environment @xcite .",
    "explanation for observed scale - free move lengths observed in spider monkeys @xcite have been based on their social behaviour @xcite .",
    "such mobility patterns of foragers was modelled in @xcite with the agents having unbounded velocities .",
    "the role of information transfer in the recruitment of foragers have been studied in colonies of social insects @xcite . very recently",
    ", the influence of communication on the foraging pattern of gazelles was investigated @xcite .",
    "the study showed that communication over intermediate length scales result in faster searches . in this paper",
    "we develop a minimal model of collective foraging where the motion of the individual foragers would be random in the absence of any interaction .",
    "we investigate the effect of interaction on the search efficiency and the spatio - temporal scaling that emerges in the movement of foragers .",
    "the foragers are walkers on a two dimensional square lattice while targets are immobile but regenerative .",
    "the foragers have local information about the distribution of the targets .",
    "a forager independently searching for targets executes a random walk ( rw ) on the lattice .",
    "however , the foragers possess global information about the state of other foragers , _",
    "i.e. _ , whether they have been successful in locating targets .",
    "we characterize the interaction between foragers through the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "this parameter controls the propensity of a forager , who is unsuccessful in finding a target in its locality , to approach the nearest site where targets have been discovered by others .",
    "we call such a movement , a targeted walk ( tw ) .",
    "we expect that when targets regenerate in the absence of any spatial correlations , the aggregation of foragers would provide no additional advantage as compared to independent searching .",
    "this aspect becomes clear from our results .",
    "however , when the reappearance of the targets is guided by spatial correlations which result in spatially heterogeneous distribution of the targets in patches @xcite we find that the efficiency attains a maximum for intermediate values of @xmath2 .",
    "this implies that for foragers who are momentarily unsuccessful in identifying targets , sometimes joining others who are successful , can be beneficial .",
    "this is the main result of our paper .",
    "also , the fact that we obtain scale - free tws under certain conditions suggests collective behaviour as one of the possible mechanisms responsible for the emergence of lvy walks in foraging patterns found in the real - world .",
    "below we describe our model in all details .",
    "we consider a two dimensional square lattice of size @xmath5 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "there are @xmath6 foragers which are initially distributed randomly on this lattice .",
    "the targets ( food ) are regenerative such that at every time step the total ( amount ) is @xmath7 .",
    "we define the neighbourhood of a forager as a circular region of radius @xmath8 centred on it .",
    "we assume that at any instant of time , a forager is able to determine which are the foragers in its neighbourhood that have been successful in identifying and consuming food .",
    "however , a forager is only able to detect targets at the site where it has arrived .",
    "let @xmath9 be the position of a forager @xmath10 on the lattice at time @xmath11 and let @xmath12 be the nearest of the all the foragers in the neighbourhood which have consumed one target at time @xmath11 .",
    "the rules governing the behaviour of @xmath10 are the following :    a.   if there are targets at @xmath9 then the forager stays at that site and consumes one .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the number of targets at a site @xmath14 at time @xmath11 .",
    "thus , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "if at any instant of time the number of foragers at any site exceeds the number of targets available , then the targets are distributed randomly between the foragers .",
    "b.   if the site @xmath9 is empty with the forager having arrived at this site by taking a _ random step _ ( defined below ) , or the forager being there in presence of food ( at time @xmath17 ) then the movement of the forager is decided according to the following rules .",
    "if there is no successful forager in the neighbourhood then the forager takes a random step , that is , @xmath18 becomes equal to one of the nearest neighbour coordinates @xmath19 or @xmath20 with equal probability .",
    "b.   if there is a successful forager @xmath12 in the neighbourhood then with a probability @xmath21 the forager ` moves ' in the direction of the former and with a probability @xmath22 moves out by taking a random step . here , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the euclidean distance between @xmath9 and @xmath25 .",
    "the movement in the direction of @xmath12 implies moving to a nearest neighbour site such that the distance between @xmath18 and @xmath25 becomes less than @xmath24 .",
    "we term this movement as a _ targeted step _ in contrast to a random step and let the forager remember this distance as @xmath26 . c.   if the site @xmath9 is empty and if the forager has arrived at this site by taking a targeted step then the movement of the forager is decided as follows",
    "same as ( ii)(a ) .",
    "if there is a forager @xmath12 in the neighbourhood and @xmath27 then the forager takes targeted step towards @xmath12 and @xmath26 .",
    "3 .   if there is a forager @xmath12 in the neighbourhood and @xmath28 then same as ( ii)(b ) .",
    "d.   this rule pertains to the regeneration of targets at every instant .",
    "let @xmath29 be the number of targets that have been consumed at any instant of time @xmath11 .",
    "we randomly select one of the remaining @xmath30 targets . at a distance @xmath1 ( @xmath31 ) from the location of this target a new target",
    "is placed , in a random direction .",
    "the distance @xmath1 is chosen from a distribution @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a parameter .",
    "this process is repeated another @xmath34 times .",
    "thus , the total number of targets at the beginning of time step @xmath35 again becomes @xmath7 .",
    "we choose such a scheme for the regeneration of targets with a two - fold view .",
    "firstly , it ensures that at any instant the distribution of resources is heterogeneous .",
    "the power - law form for @xmath36 generates targets distributed in well separated clusters .",
    "a similar scheme was used to model the spacings between marine food patches in @xcite .",
    "secondly , it provides the scope of simulating the foraging activity as a steady state process in time . a more realistic model would allow the simulation in an infinite lattice where the patches need not regenerate at every time step .",
    "in effect our model provides a method to produce a foraging environment that is highly variable in space and time @xcite .",
    "we call a consecutive sequence of random steps a rw and a consecutive sequence of targeted steps a tw . a forager which searches",
    "independently executes a rw until it encounters a target .",
    "however , there is a finite probability that such a forager may decide moving towards sites where foragers have already encountered food assuming that targets are clustered in space .",
    "it is natural that this probability is distance dependent as there is an energy cost associated with the movement of a forager @xcite .",
    "also , travelling over large distances take more time during which the targeted patch becomes increasingly exploited @xcite . therefore , nearer the location of the sites , larger is the probability of relocation .",
    "this fact is quantified through the definition of @xmath37 in ( ii)(b ) . in the limit @xmath4 the trajectories of the foragers are essentially rws .",
    "the tendency of foragers to travel towards distant locations , where targets have been discovered , increases with decrease in the value of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , trajectories become mixture of rws and tws .",
    "note that a tw , when initiated , is not aimed at a particular individual but towards a particular site .",
    "the variable @xmath38 ensures that forager has a memory of the distance to the targeted site and therefore the instantaneous movement of the forager is in a direction so as to minimize this distance . on appearance of another site , where food gets detected ,",
    "closer than the original , the tw gets directed towards it and @xmath38 is accordingly modified . in case the last targeted site is exhausted and some feeding site in the neighbourhood gets detected at a distance larger compared to the distance to the former then the forager probabilistically adopts that target depending on the distance .",
    "this rule accounts for the fact that when forager that has adopted a strategy of moving towards targets detected by others , will not easily abandon it and return to searching independently .",
    "also , a forager actually approaching a cluster of sites should not get deterred if one of the sites gets emptied . a model with somewhat similar but rather deterministic rules for the movement of the foragers",
    "was considered in @xcite where the effect of group size on foraging rate was studied . the randomness in our model",
    "is naturally built in by the probabilistic choice of the step directions of the foragers and the scheme used for the regrowth of the targets .    in the present study",
    "we assume that @xmath8 is larger than the system size , _",
    "i.e. _ , at any instant , a forager is informed about state of all other foragers .",
    "however , it is obvious that the actual use of this information is manifested through the distance dependent probability @xmath37 . also , we take @xmath39 which would correspond to the case of targets being rather scarce at the same time this equality also ensures that the maximum possible value of targets encountered per unit time per forager is unity .",
    "in general , not only the regeneration process but the interaction with the foragers is supposed to influence the distribution of targets at long times .",
    "however , with the parameters used in this paper , our simulations reveal that the heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of targets at all times is qualitatively independent of @xmath2 and is controlled through @xmath33 .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath33 the more clustered the targets become and the power - law form for @xmath36 resulting in rare but very large values of @xmath1 , gives rise to large separation between clusters .    in the figure 1",
    "we show the time evolution of the model for the parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the dynamics is deterministic to a certain extent because @xmath2 is zero .",
    "initially , ( fig .  [ fig-1](a ) ) the targets appear to be distributed in two well - separated clusters and the foragers are mostly away from these targets . at a later time",
    "[ fig-1](b ) ) the foragers are found to have aggregated over one of the clusters .",
    "this happens as soon as one of the foragers is successful in detecting a target belonging to that cluster .",
    "the trajectory of a typical foragers is shown .",
    "once the targets in the region , where the foragers are present , gets depleted there is a searching phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1](c ) ) .",
    "the trajectory of the foragers at this stage are mostly rws .",
    "the search ends as soon as a site in the second cluster is detected by any forager and all the others relocate towards the site .",
    "the trajectory during this relocation mostly comprises of tws ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1](d ) and ( e ) ) .",
    "eventually , the second cluster is also consumed and another searching phase follows ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1](f ) ) .",
    "the simultaneous development of clusters of targets in other regions of the lattice is also visible in the figure .",
    "we assume that the cost involved in foraging is proportional to the distance travelled by the foragers .",
    "the efficiency of searching @xcite , defined as the ratio of the total number of targets consumed to the total distance travelled by all the foragers , is given by @xmath44 where , @xmath45 is the number of walkers at time @xmath11 .",
    "the statistics is collected in the stationary state for @xmath46 time steps in each configuration and @xmath47 denotes the average over @xmath48 configurations . in fig .",
    "[ fig-2](a ) we plot @xmath49 as a function of @xmath2 . for @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    "we are able to compare the efficiency of the searches for targets distributions at different degrees of patchiness characterized by @xmath33 . when targets regenerate randomly across the lattice we find @xmath49 to increase with @xmath2 and then saturate to a value in the limit of @xmath4 .",
    "thus , searching independently is overall beneficial .",
    "however , for values of @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the efficiency is found to be maximum for different values of @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "when targets are clustered in space we expect that a forager travelling to a region where targets have already been discovered increases its own chance of encountering a target .",
    "however , indiscriminately taking such decisions may not be beneficial .",
    "travelling to distant clusters increases the cost and by the time the forager reaches the region , it is depleted of targets .",
    "therefore , joining others when clusters are discovered nearby and opting to search independently , otherwise is found to be most efficient . unlike the scenario described in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] this intermediate strategy may amount to the simultaneous discovery and exploitation of more than one cluster or faster discovery of newly generated clusters . for extremely clustered distributions ( @xmath55 ) the efficiency in the limit @xmath56 is larger than that of the @xmath4 limit unlike for lesser values of @xmath33 .",
    "this is because the regenerated clusters appear very close to each other and as such aggregation allows the foragers to move from one cluster to another with least amount of exploration .",
    "a comparison between different values of @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 shows that the maximum value of efficiency is larger for larger values of @xmath60 .",
    "we quantify this effect by scaling collapse of @xmath49 versus @xmath2 plots for five different values of @xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ fig-2](b ) with @xmath51 and @xmath42 .",
    "the collapse reveals that the width of the maximum in @xmath49 scales as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and the maximum value of the efficiency , @xmath63 scales as @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "we define @xmath66 as the value of @xmath2 for which @xmath67 .",
    "the values @xmath66 for which the collapse becomes possible is plotted against @xmath60 in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig-2](b ) .",
    "the plot shows that @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "interestingly , near the maximum of efficiency we find that there is a maximum for the fraction of walkers executing tws . in fig .",
    "[ fig-3](a ) we plot the averaged quantity , @xmath70 , defined as the ratio of the number of foragers executing tws to the total number of walkers at any instant . as expected @xmath70 goes to zero as @xmath4 since the foragers do not follow each other . also , @xmath70 is large as @xmath56 .",
    "the activity of the foragers in this limit is similar to the scenario illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] .",
    "the dominant activity is searching ( through rws ) in - between the discovery of clusters and the simultaneous discovery of clusters are rare .",
    "the tws only occur in short bouts . for intermediate values of @xmath2 ,",
    "when there is a possibility that a cluster can be detected while another one is being exploited , the tws take place more frequently .",
    "this results in @xmath70 having a maximum .",
    "when targets regenerate randomly across the lattice the tws are not beneficial in terms of the efficiency as already seen from fig  [ fig-2](a ) .",
    "decrease in the value of @xmath2 favours the increase in aggregation of the foragers through tws whereas the aggregation reduces the number of forager - target encounters .",
    "this competition results in the maximum of @xmath70 for random regeneration .",
    "the effect of random reappearance of targets coupled to extreme aggregation for @xmath3 and the fact that we use pbc , gives rise to a stable moving band in the steady state as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-4](a ) .",
    "the band travels parallel to either of the axis .    when a forager comes across a site @xmath14 having targets , the time spent at that site , before it moves away , is in general equal to the number of targets present , @xmath71 ( unless other foragers are also present at the site ) .",
    "large values of @xmath33 , result in sites with @xmath72 . as a result the presence of a forager at such a site is of longer duration .",
    "now , if @xmath2 is also small then such a forager , at any instant , draws towards the site a large number of foragers who execute tws . during the time the former spends consuming targets , the tws of the latter align .",
    "such an alignment of the paths of a set of moving foragers generates an overall pattern of a moving column .",
    "such a case is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig-4](b ) where two such perpendicular columns are seen giving rise to a wedge .",
    "such a formation persists and as a whole travels until the adjacent targets are not depleted .",
    "the observation of different patterns encouraged us to investigate the general nature of collective motion .",
    "we measured the order parameter popularly used to characterize motion of flocks of self - propelled particles @xcite .",
    "as the motion of the foragers is restricted to the lattice , the order parameter is @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the fraction of foragers moving towards the positive @xmath75-direction at any instant and likewise .",
    "temporal and configuration averaging is denoted by @xmath47 and is similar to the calculation of @xmath49 . in fig .",
    "[ fig-3](b ) the plot @xmath76 versus @xmath2 is shown .",
    "we find that the maximum of @xmath49 is accompanied by a transition from a regime where the value of @xmath76 is dominated by fluctuations due to random movement of the foragers to a higher values of @xmath76 .",
    "the higher values of @xmath76 occur when foragers migrate from one cluster to another . however , the actual values of the order parameter are low because of the movement on the lattice and that just after the depletion of a cluster , the forager diffuse in all directions .",
    "the influence of the collective searching on the movement of individual foragers is evidenced in the distribution of lengths of tws .",
    "the tendency to search independently is less when @xmath2 is small and long tws are probable . in fig .",
    "[ fig-5 ] we plot the probability distribution of @xmath77 of length of tws of length @xmath78 .",
    "we find that tws become scale - free in the limit of @xmath56 for patchy distributions .",
    "for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 we find @xmath79 with @xmath80 ( using regression analysis @xcite ) .",
    "as @xmath2 increases the tws become shorter and the distribution falls off faster .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-5](a ) . for random distribution of targets and extremely clustered distribution ( @xmath55 ) which correspond to moving bands and columns , respectively",
    ", there is a deviation from power - law ( fig .",
    "[ fig-5](b ) ) . in the limit @xmath56",
    "we generally find that scale - free tws arise for values of @xmath60 which are either equal to @xmath5 or larger but close to @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig-5](c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "for @xmath81 the distribution is fat - tailed but not a power - law . in case of @xmath82",
    "the clusters are exploited so fast that long tws become rare .",
    "the interdependence is also evident in the temporal behaviour of model .",
    "when targets are clustered there is usually a waiting time corresponding to the searching phase between the discovery of clusters .",
    "we define @xmath83 as the time between successive encounters with targets by the group as a whole . in fig .",
    "[ fig-6 ] we plot the probability distribution @xmath84 . with the decrease in the value of @xmath2",
    "the states of the foragers become increasingly correlated .",
    "this is reflected in the power - law nature of @xmath84 . for @xmath85 and @xmath42",
    "we find @xmath86 with @xmath87 for values of @xmath2 between @xmath88 to @xmath89 ( fig  [ fig-6](a ) ) .",
    "we find the power - law form for @xmath84 to be retained for larger values of @xmath33 as well .",
    "the value of @xmath33 becoming lesser finally leading to a random distribution of targets makes @xmath84 fall faster ( fig  [ fig-6](b ) ) .",
    "faster decay of @xmath84 also occurs when @xmath90 ( fig .",
    "[ fig-6](c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "this is because when both targets as well as foragers are abundant the long waiting times become rear .",
    "our model shows that the presence of interactions within a group of foragers can help maximize the efficiency of searching .",
    "the decision of an individual as well as the cost is assumed to depend on distances between members .",
    "the optimal strategy , from which the group is benefited as a whole , is a mixture of searching independently and joining other members .",
    "the dependence of the efficiency on the parameter @xmath2 and the fact that the @xmath2 is the inverse of a length scale also supports the notion that the exchange of information above a length scale may not be really useful for the group as a whole @xcite .",
    "we also find that such interactions can lead to scale - free walks by the foragers in certain limits .",
    "interdependence between foragers also correlates the states of the foragers which manifest in power - law distributed waiting times .",
    "the model also shows that under certain conditions stable and transient patterns of collective motion can emerge .",
    "a natural extension of the model would be to consider lvy walks for motion of foragers searching independently",
    ". it would be also interesting to incorporate flock cohesion in the model and study its influence on the efficiency of foraging .",
    "we believe that our model can help understand overall foraging patterns of animal groups in terms of simple strategies at the level of the individual animals .",
