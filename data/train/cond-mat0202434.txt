    "the calculation of the band structure of metals and insulators is a central task in solid - state theory .",
    "a commonly accepted method for this purpose is the density - functional theory ( dft ) which provides surprisingly accurate results for the band structure of many materials  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dft is an ` ab - initio ' theory , i.e. , it starts from the full hamiltonian of a real system and does not require the introduction of any simplified models .",
    "the only competing ` ab - initio ' theory was hartree - fock theory , which has shown very many shortcomings as compared to dft , such as gross overestimation of band widths and band gaps .",
    "however , from a theoretical point of view , the success of the dft for band structures is rather astonishing because this theory is a generic approach to ground - state properties only .",
    "all results on energy bands are extracted from auxiliary one - particle dispersions which have no physical meaning at the outset .",
    "indeed , some shortcomings of the dft energy bands have become evident very early , in particular the underestimation of the fundamental gap in semiconductors . in semiconductors and insulators , the so - called gw approximation to the one - particle green function has been put forward  @xcite . there , the single - particle self energy is calculated using a green function based on the dft wave functions and the screened coulomb interaction .",
    "it turns out that the gw quasi - particle bands are more or less rigidly shifted against the dft bands so that the band gap results of gw  calculations for semiconductors and insulators agree much better with experiment .    for materials with strong electron - electron interactions ,",
    "the dft results have not been too convincing , in particular for magnetic insulators and other strongly correlated electron systems . for the iron group metals the discrepancies of dft results to experimental data ,",
    "e.g. , angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , increase towards the end of the series , i.e. , towards nickel ; for a detailed discussion on the discrepancies between dft results and experimental data on nickel , see refs .  .",
    "for the iron group metals , gw calculations did not yield significant improvements over the dft results ; for nickel , see ref .  .",
    "a proper description of solids with strong coulomb interactions requires true many - particle approaches . in the past ,",
    "the notorious difficulties of many - particle systems have restricted such theories to the study of rather simplified model systems , e.g. , the one - band hubbard model .",
    "therefore , a comparison with experiments on real materials could hardly be performed . only recently , new non - perturbative many - particle methods have become available which have made possible the investigation of more realistic many - particle models ; see , for example , refs .  . in ref .",
    "we introduced a class of gutzwiller variational wave functions which allow us to study general multi - band hubbard models .",
    "expectation values with these correlated electron states are evaluated exactly in the limit of large spatial dimensions , @xmath2 . when applied to nickel ,",
    "the remaining minimization problem is numerically non - trivial because of the large number of variational parameters ; first results are reported in refs .  .",
    "the gutzwiller variational theory provides an approximate picture of the ground state but , in principle , it lacks any information about excited states .",
    "this drawback can be overcome in two ways .",
    "first , if we take for granted that the variational ground state is at least qualitatively close to the true ground state , we may use the variational state as a starting point for the variational calculation of excited states . in ref .",
    "we have used this idea to determine the spin - wave dispersion in ferromagnetic multi - band hubbard models .",
    "we have successfully reproduced the experimental observation that the low - energy spin excitations in itinerant ferromagnets are very similar to those of a system with localized spins .",
    "second , the calculation of the variational ground - state energy in the limit of infinite dimensions  @xcite naturally leads to the definition of an effective single - particle hamiltonian which , in some limits , can also be derived in slave - boson mean - field theory  @xcite . very much in the spirit of the dft we used the band structure of this effective hamiltonian for a successful comparison with arpes data for nickel .",
    "we have been able to resolve basically all of the lda shortcomings .    despite its success",
    ", the second approach still lacks a sound theoretical basis . in this work",
    "we derive the ( variational ) quasi - particle dispersion referring back to landau s original ideas on fermi liquids .",
    "the gutzwiller variational state is an illustrative example for a fermi - liquid ground state : the gutzwiller many - body correlator acts on the fermi - gas ground state whereby energetically unfavorable configurations are gradually reduced . in the spirit of fermi - liquid theory ,",
    "a quasi - particle excitation is readily viewed as a gutzwiller - correlated single - particle excitation of the fermi - gas ground state .",
    "the energy of this excitation is identical to the quasi - particle dispersion in our original work  @xcite .",
    "therefore , no revision of our previous numerical results on nickel  @xcite is necessary .",
    "the evaluation of the variational energy in our method is exact only in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions .",
    "our application to realistic three - dimensional systems requires that @xmath1  corrections are well controlled . as is known from the one - band model , these corrections are small for ground - state properties such as the ( variational ) energy or the effective mass of the quasi - particles at the fermi surface . in this work",
    "we will present additional results on  @xmath1  corrections of the quasi - particle dispersion for the one - band hubbard model .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we summarize the basic ideas of landau - gutzwiller theory . in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] we discuss the variational ground state for multi - band hubbard models . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we define landau - gutzwiller quasi - particles and derive their energy dispersion . in sect .",
    "[ sec5 ] we calculate @xmath1  corrections for the quasi - particle dispersion of the one - band model . our presentation closes with short conclusions .",
    "some technical details are deferred to the appendix .",
    "in second quantization the hamilton operator for non - interacting electrons reads @xmath3 here , @xmath4 creates an electron with combined spin - orbit index  @xmath5 ( @xmath6 for 3@xmath7  electrons ) at the lattice site  @xmath8 of a solid with @xmath9  lattice sites . the electron density , @xmath10 , is finite in the thermodynamic limit @xmath11 , @xmath12 .    for a translationally invariant system , as considered throughout this work , this single - particle hamiltonian is readily diagonalized in momentum space . its eigenstates are one - particle product states  @xmath13 . in particular , the ground state  @xmath14 is the filled fermi sea where all single - particle states below the fermi energy are occupied .",
    "all other eigenstates can be understood as particle - hole excitations of @xmath14 .",
    "one essential idea behind landau s fermi liquid theory is the assumption that the fermi - gas picture remains valid qualitatively when electron - electron interactions are switched on ; for an introduction , see , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "the fermi - gas eigenstates transform adiabatically into those of the fermi liquid while keeping their physical properties .",
    "for example , the momentum distribution displays a discontinuity at the fermi energy both in the fermi gas and in the fermi liquid . naturally , the properties of the ground state and of the particle - hole excitations change quantitatively .",
    "therefore , the excitations are called quasi - particles and quasi - holes in the fermi liquid .",
    "gutzwiller s variational",
    "theory closely follows the idea of an adiabatic continuity from the fermi gas to the fermi liquid .",
    "let us introduce a general class of gutzwiller - correlated wave functions via @xmath15 is any normalized one - particle product state .",
    "the gutzwiller correlator @xmath16 is a many - body operator which suppresses those configurations which are energetically unfavorable with respect to the electron - electron interaction .",
    "therefore , the ( approximate ) fermi - liquid ground state @xmath17 evolves smoothly from a fermi - gas ground state @xmath18 when the electron - electron interaction is switched on .",
    "in fact , this concept has been used by vollhardt  @xcite to develop a microscopic theory for the ground - state properties of liquid @xmath19he on the basis of gutzwiller s approach .    in this work ,",
    "we use landau s idea to extend gutzwiller s variational approach to quasi - particle excitations . in principle , this does not pose a big problem . instead of a fermi - liquid ground state  @xmath18 , we use single - particle excitations @xmath20 of the fermi gas in  ( [ 30 ] ) to define quasi - particle states . in sect .",
    "[ sec4 ] we will give a proper mathematical definition of a quasi - particle excitation . here",
    "we point out that all restrictions of fermi - liquid theory apply .",
    "for example , only the low - energy properties of metals , close to the fermi energy , ought to be described in this way .",
    "nevertheless , experiments on metals show that well - defined but life - time broadened quasi - particle excitations can be found even for energies of about @xmath21 below the fermi energy . therefore",
    ", the concept of quasi - particles and quasi - holes remains meaningful for those parts of the valence and conduction bands which are relevant in solid - state physics .",
    "in the following we study multi - band hubbard models where the electron - electron interaction is purely local , @xmath22 here , the atomic hamiltonian @xmath23 contains all possible coulomb - interaction terms between electrons on site  @xmath8 , @xmath24 we assume that the eigenstates @xmath25 of the atomic hamiltonian have been determined @xmath26 this is possible in all cases of interest , at least numerically . in the following , the site index will often be suppressed as we are primarily interested in translationally invariant systems .",
    "the gutzwiller theory allows us to study the hamiltonian  ( [ 10 ] ) with an arbitrary number of orbitals  @xcite . in this work , however , we will restrict ourselves to the special case where non - degenerate orbitals belong to different representations of the respective point - symmetry group .",
    "for example , in cubic symmetry we allow for only one set of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30  orbitals .    the gutzwiller correlator @xmath31 is parameterized by @xmath32 real numbers  @xmath33 .",
    "for an energetically unfavorable atomic configuration  @xmath34 the minimization will result in @xmath35 whereby its weight in @xmath20 is reduced .      in the limit of large spatial dimensions , the expectation value of the hamiltonian  ( [ 10 ] ) in the wave function  ( [ 30 ] )",
    "can be expressed in terms of the one - particle product wave function  @xmath20 and the expectation values @xmath36 for all details , see ref .  .",
    "after a lengthy calculation one obtains the following variational energy    [ 43 ] @xmath37    where @xmath38 the calculation only requires @xmath20 to be a one - particle product wave state ; @xmath20 need not be a filled fermi sea .    for a given set of coulomb parameters in  ( [ 20 ] ) the renormalization factors @xmath39 only depend on the local spin - orbital densities @xmath40 and the variational parameters @xmath41 for states @xmath42 with more than one electron .",
    "an explicit expression for  ( [ 47 ] ) has been given in ref .  , but it is not needed for our further considerations . note that for our symmetry - restricted orbital basis @xmath43 holds .",
    "@xmath44 in  ( [ 43 ] ) depends on the variational parameters @xmath41 , the local densities @xmath45 , and the wave function @xmath46 .",
    "however , the constraints @xmath47 have to be respected during the minimization as we work for fixed  @xmath48 in the sub - space of normalized one - particle product states , @xmath49 .",
    "we introduce lagrange parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 for these constraints which leads to the energy functional @xmath53&= & e^{\\rm var}[{\\ensuremath{\\left|",

    "first , we use the condition that  ( [ 160 ] ) is extremal with respect to @xmath46 and @xmath50 .",
    "this gives us the following effective schrdinger equation which has to be solved in the sub - space of normalized states  @xmath46 @xmath55 with @xmath56 the effective one - particle hamiltonian @xmath57 can be diagonalized , @xmath58 by introducing proper creation and annihilation operators @xmath59 note that the amplitudes @xmath60 , the energies @xmath61 , and the operators @xmath62 , @xmath63 still depend on the parameters @xmath41 , @xmath45 , and @xmath51 .",

    "for further reference we give a short summary of our most efficient procedure .",
    "first , we note that the conditions @xmath90 and @xmath91 take us back to the original constraints  ( [ 150 ] ) ,    @xmath92    therefore , we are left with two different sets of variational parameters , the ` internal ' parameters @xmath41 and the ` external ' parameters @xmath51 . optimizing the energy with respect to both of these sets is time - costly , for different reasons .",
    "the problem with the internal parameters is their large number which is of the order  @xmath32 ( @xmath93 for @xmath7  orbitals ) . compared to this",
    "there are only a few , @xmath94 , external parameters  @xmath51",
    ". however , each modification of one of these external parameters demands for momentum - space integrations according to the sums in  ( [ 230 ] ) and  ( [ 210 ] ) .",
    "we found these integrations to be the most time - consuming part of our numerical minimization . in principle , such integrals must also be calculated whenever we change the parameters @xmath41 , because they determine the amplitudes @xmath60 and the energies @xmath95 . in order to avoid this large number of integrations",

    "we will see below that it is actually possible to define operators @xmath102 and @xmath103 which obey  ( [ 50 ] ) in the whole brillouin zone and not only around the fermi surface .",

    "as long as @xmath206 , a finite value of  @xmath188 amounts to a rescaling of the overall band width .",
    "when we apply our theory to real materials  @xcite the band width is basically controlled by the racah - parameter  @xmath207 which we adjust to fit the experimental band width .",

    "in this work we used landau s fermi - liquid picture to define quasi - particle excitations in terms of gutzwiller - correlated wave functions . starting from the optimum variational ground state of a general multi - band hubbard - model we identified operators which describe the creation and annihilation of quasi - particles in this state .",
    "we calculated the quasi - particle dispersion analytically in the limit of infinite dimensions .",
    "our variational states provide an illustrative example for landau quasi - particles .",
    "they are also suitable for numerical investigations , e.g. , with variational monte - carlo techniques .",
    "we gave two definitions of quasi - particle operators , with and without a relaxation of the fermi - sea background .",
    "it turns out that it is more convenient to allow a ( small ) change of the variational parameters of the fermi - sea background in the presence of the quasi - particles .",
    "we showed that both cases lead to the same result for the quasi - particle dispersion .",
    "this absence of a orthogonality catastrophe is characteristic for fermi liquids .",
    "our results confirm our earlier calculations in which the quasi - particle dispersion had been extracted phenomenologically from an effective one - particle hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to density - functional theory , our quasi - particle dispersions correspond to mathematically well - defined ( variational ) states in realistic multi - band hubbard models . in general , our quasi - particle bands are narrower than the dft bands because of the hopping - reduction factors @xmath99 in  ( [ 43 ] ) .",
    "moreover , as seen in  ( [ 170 ] ) , the gutzwiller theory has the flexibility for the adjustment of the orbital energies through the parameters @xmath51 so that the dft bands are shifted and mixed into the landau - gutzwiller quasi - particle bands .",
    "our derivation of the gutzwiller theory uses approximations which become exact in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions , @xmath2 . for this reason , we calculated first - order corrections in @xmath1 for the quasi - particle dispersion of the one - band hubbard model .",
    "apart from the special case close to half band - filling , these corrections were found to be relatively small .",
    "consequently , the quasi - particle bands as derived in @xmath185 for multi - band hubbard models contain the essential information of the gutzwiller states in three dimensions , and are thus suitable for a meaningful comparison with real , three - dimensional fermi liquids .",
