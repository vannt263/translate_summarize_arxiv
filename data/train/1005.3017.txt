    "the origin of brown dwarfs ( bds , to which we also include very low - mass stars @xmath2 ) as well as the formation of massive exoplanets is contentious .",
    "the most common idea is that bds form like stars , and planets form by accretion onto a core formed from dust conglomeration within a circumstellar disc .",
    "however , there is increasing evidence that an alternative formation scenario for bds and , possibly , some of the most massive exoplanets is required .",
    "bds differ from low - mass stars in several ways .",
    "firstly , there is the ` brown dwarf desert '  a lack of bd companions to stars , especially at separations below about 30  au within which companion planets and stars are common .",
    "in addition , the properties of bd - bd binaries are very different from star - star binaries , showing a significant lack of systems wider than @xmath3  au beyond which most stellar binaries are found . furthermore , while typically every second star is a binary system only every fifth bd is a binary .",
    "clearly we must ask ourselves why stars and bds are so different if they form by the same mechanism . indeed , in order to numerically set - up a realistic stellar and bd population , stars and bds need to be according to different algorithmic pairing rules @xcite .",
    "in other words , they follow different formation channels .",
    "the fragmentation of extended circumstellar discs is one of the most promising alternatives to the standard scenario of star - like formation for bds @xcite .",
    "research on circumstellar disc evolution has made great progress in recent years , but there are still many unanswered questions @xcite .",
    "one issue that has gained surprisingly little attention in the past is the role of gravitational interactions between the disc and passing stars within the young host stellar cluster .",
    "since stars are generally born in clusters @xcite , rather than as isolated objects , star - disc and disc - disc interactions @xcite probably play an important role for the dynamical evolution of such discs and thus for massive planet and bd formation through fragmentation of the discs .    for a typical open star cluster hosting about 1000 stars within a half - mass radius of 0.5  pc , encounters closer than 500  au will happen approximately every 10  myr @xcite .",
    "they are even more frequent in denser clusters in which are thought to form at least half of the stars in the galaxy .",
    "encounters in star clusters are therefore expected to play a significant role in the evolution of extended discs of several 100  au radii .",
    "the formation of planets through core accretion is typically expected to happen within the innermost 100  au of a circumstellar disc @xcite , although there are many unanswered questions especially concerning the very first stages of core accretion @xcite .",
    "fragmentation has been proposed as an alternative way to form the most massive gas giant planets by @xcite . in recent years , however , there has been a growing consensus that disc fragmentation can not produce gas giant planets in the inner regions of discs for two reasons : ( 1 ) heating from the central star stabilizes the innermost regions and thus inhibits fragmentation , and ( 2 ) these regions can not cool fast enough to allow temporary gas clumps to collapse @xcite .",
    "this picture changes greatly beyond about 100  au where cooling becomes sufficiently efficient for gravitational collapse to occur .",
    "consequently , disc fragmentation has been proposed as an alternative mechanism for the formation of bds @xcite .",
    "most of these investigations , however , assume that the disc evolves in isolation .",
    "star - disc and disc - disc collisions have been investigated in previous studies @xcite but without a realistic treatment of the radiative heat transfer in the disc . from sph computations",
    "@xcite deduce that close encounters inhibit fragmentation in typical protoplanetary discs ( assuming an initial radius of 40  au ) rather than inducing it .",
    "in contrast to that , a recent study of disc - disc collisions @xcite has , however , shown that the direct compression of gas by the close encounters of stars hosting massive extended discs ( disc mass @xmath4  , disc radius @xmath5  au ) , may trigger the formation of substellar companions .",
    "however such massive , extended discs are probably short - lived @xcite ( in contrast to typical protoplanetary discs which are about ten times smaller and less massive ) , so that pairwise interactions of two discs of this kind are expected to be rare .",
    "the purely gravitational interaction of a low - mass star with no ( or only a small ) protoplanetary disc with a star hosting a massive disc would be much more likely .",
    "although even these encounters may probably account for only a fraction of all bds , especially in loose associations like taurus - auriga , they provide an additional channel of forming bds out of discs that would otherwise probably dissolve without ever fragmenting . in this paper",
    "we address this issue . in section  [ sec : model ] , besides an estimate of the encounter probability , the model of the circumstellar disc is described .",
    "section  [ sec : method ] depicts the computational methods and gives an overview of the model parameters studied in this work .",
    "the results are then presented in section  [ sec : results ] and discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "the likelihood of a close stellar encounter with an impact parameter @xmath6 depends on the stellar density of the star - forming environment and the impact parameter itself .",
    "the encounter event is then further characterized by the relative velocity of the two stars and thus the eccentricity of the path .",
    "the consequences on the circumstellar disc further depend on the mass of the perturber and the host star ( i.e. , the ratio of binding energy and magnitude of the perturbation ) and the inclination of the disc plane wrt .",
    "the plane of the encounter hyperbola .",
    "stars can be born in a variety of environments from low - density groups like taurus - auriga ( about 300 stars distributed in groups , each being < 1 pc in radius and containing about a few dozen stars ) up to onc - type clusters ( thousands of stars within 0.5  pc ) or even in more massive and dense clusters @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the encounter probability has been derived assuming a plummer star cluster model of half - mass radius , , total mass , and an average stellar mass , .",
    "note that two other radial scales are also often used to describe a plummer model : the plummer radius , @xmath7 , and the gravitational scale radius , @xmath8 . from @xcite ,",
    "section 1.3 , the expected time , @xmath9 , between two encounters within an encounter parameter , @xmath6 , can be obtained from the characteristic crossing time , @xmath10 and the average number , , of encounter parameters below @xmath6 , for a given number of stars , @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xmath9 is approximately given by @xmath13 it has to be noted that the actual periastron distance , @xmath14 , is always ( and sometimes significantly ) smaller than @xmath6 due to gravitational focusing .",
    "the relation between @xmath14 and @xmath6 for a given eccentricity , @xmath15 , is @xmath16 for an onc - type cluster with @xmath17 , an average star mass @xmath18 , a total mass @xmath19 ( i.e. , 30  of the mass consists of stars and the rest of gas , see @xcite ) , and a half - mass radius of @xmath20 we find that encounters below 500  au occur on average every 11 million years .",
    "if a massive extended disc exists for about 1 myr this means that about 9 per cent of all discs of this type will suffer such an encounter .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions for the disc are taken from @xcite .",
    "the disc model has a power law profile for temperature , @xmath21 , and surface density , @xmath22 from @xcite , both as a function of the distance , @xmath23 , from the central star , @xmath24 @xmath25^{1/2}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is chosen corresponding to a disc mass of 0.48 and 0.50  ( see table  [ tab : sims ] ) , i.e. , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "@xmath32  k is a background temperature to account for the background radiation from other stars within the host cluster .",
    "this configuration leads to an initial toomre stability parameter , @xmath33 , @xcite between 1.3 and 1.4 between about 100 and 400  au , leading to weak spiral density patterns but not to fragmentation .",
    "@xmath33 is given by @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the sound speed , and @xmath36 being the epicyclic frequency which can be , at least roughly , approximated by the keplerian orbital frequency .",
    "the radiation of the perturber is included in the same way as that of the central star , assuming a mass - to - luminosity relation of @xmath37 for low - mass stars .",
    "however , as long as the perturber is no more than about 0.5  , corresponding to an early m - type or late k - type main sequence star , its influence on disc evolution is very small .",
    "the disc is initially populated by sph particles between 40 and 400  au . before starting the actual encounter computation the disc is allowed to `` settle '' for about 20  000 years ( i.e. , about two orbits at the outer rim ) to avoid artefacts from the initial distribution function . during this settling the disc smears out at the inner and the outer border extending its radial range from a few au up to @xmath38  au , eventually stabilising .",
    "the @xmath33 value is slightly increased beyond 200  au relative to the initial setting while remaining largely unchanged below this radius , as can be seen in figure [ discprofile ] . the actual surface density after the settling is therefore slightly smaller and thus the disc slightly more stable than in the initial setup .",
    "any self - fragmentation of the unperturbed disc would have happened during the settling time when the toomre parameter is lowest .",
    "all computations were performed by using the well - tested dragon sph code by @xcite including the radiative transfer extension by @xcite .",
    "most of the numerical parameter settings have been adopted from @xcite .",
    "gravitationally collapsing clumps are treated by sink particles which form if the volume density exceeds @xmath39 , and the clump is bound .",
    "the sink radius is 1  au , in accordance with the studies mentioned above and in agreement with the local jeans criterion .",
    "in addition , the central star and the perturbing star are both represented by sink particles .",
    "there are ongoing discussions whether fragmentation can be triggered artificially due to the numerical behaviour of sph and grid - based hydrocodes .",
    "@xcite find that smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) does not suffer from artificial fragmentation .",
    "however , @xcite suggest that sph may artificially enhance fragmentation due to a pressure - underestimation if the smoothing radius , @xmath40 , is considerably larger than about 1/4 of a vertical scale height of a circumstellar disc .",
    "@xcite show that this criterion is fulfilled for 150,000 or more particles , for the types of disc studied in this paper .",
    "@xcite have performed calculations of fragmenting protostellar clouds with the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code ramses and the sph code dragon ( which we have been using for this study ) and compared the results at different resolutions given by the number @xmath11 of grid cells and particles , respectively . for about @xmath41 cells / particles fragmentation in both codes appeared nearly equal . with @xmath42",
    "the results were very similar to the high - resolution amr computations while being still acceptable for many purposes at @xmath43 .",
    "@xcite briefly review the resolution criteria with respect to their models using 150  000 in that paper and 250  000 to 400  000 particles earlier @xcite .",
    "the three most important resolution criteria are the resolution of the local jeans mass , @xmath44 , ( and thus the jeans length ) , the local toomre mass and the vertical scale height of the disc .",
    "in particular , the local jeans mass , @xmath45 must be resolved by at least a factor of @xmath46 , corresponding to 0.5  for the 100,000 particle discs and 0.2  for the 250,000 particle discs . since the global disc setup as well as",
    "the evolution after the perturbation ( section [ sec : results ] ) is quite similar to that used by @xcite , as similar range of jeans masses of the forming clumps , i.e. , @xmath47@xmath48  , can be reasonably assumed for our models and has actually been tested for the models e / x002 and e / x009 for all forming objects .",
    "the minimum @xmath44 during the clump formation is typically between 4 and 6  and does never go below about 2  .",
    "therefore , @xmath44 is resolved by a safe factor of at least 4 in the low - resolution case and 10 in the high - resolution case .",
    "accordingly , the minimum toomre mass of 2.5  is adequately resolved as well as the vertical scale height ( by at least a few smoothing lengths ) .      in @xcite",
    "the possibility of fragmentation has been estimated via the toomre criterion for both isothermal and adiabatic equations of state , both resulting in perturbed regions with highly unstable conditions ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "however , toomre instability does not necessarily lead to actual fragmentation .    in realistic models of radiative transfer , such as the one used here",
    ", the thermal response of the gas to density changes is between near - isothermal in regions with efficient cooling ( outside about 100200  au ) and near - adiabatic in regions with long cooling times ( the inner parts of the disc ) .",
    "@xcite have shown that direct disc - disc collisions may lead to fragmentation of massive extended discs at some 400  au even for a `` thick disc approximation '' , i.e. , the near - adiabatic case .",
    "the @xcite method uses the density and the gravitational potential of each sph particle to estimate an optical depth for each particle through which the particle cools and heats .",
    "the method takes into account compressional heating , viscous heating , radiative heating by the background , and radiative cooling .",
    "it performs well , in both the optically thin and optically thick regimes , and has been extensively tested by @xcite . in particular",
    "it reproduces the detailed 3d results of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and also the analytic results of @xcite .",
    "additionally the code has been tested and performs well in disc configurations as it reproduces the analytic results of @xcite .",
    "the gas is assumed to be a mixture of hydrogen and helium .",
    "we use an equation of stare by @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite that accounts ( 1 ) for the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of molecular hydrogen , and ( 2 ) for the different chemical states of hydrogen and helium .",
    "we assume that ortho- and para - hydrogen are in equilibrium .    for the dust and gas opacity we use the parameterisation by @xcite , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath6 are constants that depend on the species and the physical processes contributing to the opacity at each @xmath53 and @xmath21 .",
    "the opacity changes due to ice mantle melting , the sublimation of dust , molecular and h@xmath54 contributions , are all taken into account .",

    "about 20003000 years after the periastron passage parts of the tidal arms become gravitationally unstable , and spiral - shaped over - densities begin to form ( see the snapshots from model x002 in figure [ imgx002 ] ) .",

    "temporary overdensities do also occur within less than 100  au but , however , dissolve quickly .",
    "this is probably due to the heating from the central star and the less effective cooling in these regions as already being mentioned in the introduction and by @xcite . at radii larger than about 200  au , on the other hand",
    ", the gas density is apparently too low for gravitationally bound clumps for form .",
    "each of the calculations typically produces between two and five ( six on one case ) low - mass objects with masses between those of very massive planets ( 0.01  ) and very low - mass stars ( 0.13  ) .",
    "additionally , mass is accreted onto the central star , and also mass is transfered to the perturber during the encounter . in the model shown in figure [ imgx002 ] five objects with masses between 0.013  and 0.10  form ; two of them being bound in a binary system .",
    "in addition , 0.016  of gas accretes onto the central star within 15  000 years , and 0.0028  =  2.8 jupiter masses ( ) of gas transfers to the perturber ( into the representing sink particle ) while about 0.012  ( @xmath77 ) is captured around the perturber as a circumstellar envelope . in our analysis , any gas that is present within a radius of 40  au but outside the sink radius is counted as circumstellar material of the perturber and shown in the ninth column of table  [ tab : sims ] .",

    "28 bodies between 0.01 and 0.15  formed in eight high resolution calculations , while the ten 100  000 particle calculations that showed fragmentation , yielded 30 bodies between 0.01 and 0.16  ( see tables  [ tab : sims ] and [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "thus , there is no statistically significant relation between the resolution and the number of formed bodies .",
    "similarly , no clear trend towards lower minimum masses of the companions for the high resolution can be derived from the current data .",

    "the overall outcome is very similar to that of unperturbed self - fragmenting disc as shown in @xcite except for the lower disc mass .",
    "this is quite plausible since the main difference between the two scenarios is the cause for the density patterns which undergo fragmentation .",
    "while toomre density waves are the source of fragmentation in self - fragmenting discs , the gravitationally induced fragmentation occurs in tidal arms .",
    "in both cases , a dense bar - like in the disc reaches the density limit for fragmentation and thus the underlying physics is essentially the same .",
    "figure [ created ] shows the mass distribution of the @xmath78 bodies created all calculations with 100  000 particles ( top frame ) , 250  000 particles ( middle frame ) and both combined ( bottom frame ) .",
    "a power law mass function @xmath79 can be fitted to this distribution .",
    "this has been done in this figure for the substellar regime ( dashed line ) . in the bi - logarithmic scaling",
    ", the slope of @xmath80 corresponds to @xmath81 due to the differentiation of the logarithm ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the linear fit to the mass function for all calculation outputs combined appears to have a slope of @xmath82 ( @xmath83  ) corresponding to power law index of @xmath84 .",
    "if the calculations are separated by resolution , the 100  000 particle models correspond to @xmath85 while the 250  000 particle models similarly yield @xmath86 .",
    "the slightly flatter imf in the separate mass functions may be interpreted as a weak resolution - dependence of the average created mass which gets smeared out in the combined mass function . however , the difference between the slopes of @xmath87 is within the @xmath88 uncertainty the uncertainty , based on the poisson errors of the log mass bins , is indicated by a shaded region . above 0.12  there is a sharp drop in the mass distribution that can be treated as a truncation .",
    "similar results have been obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this is also in good agreement with both the sub - stellar imf deduced by @xcite as well as with the separate substellar imf deduced in @xcite .",
    "however , more calculations are needed to provide statistically robust tests of the imf .",
    "furthermore , there is no weighting with respect to the different likelihood of the different encounter settings ( i.e. , inclination , fly - by distance etc . ) . since the outcome of the computations does not show a specific dependency on the orbital parameters ( except for whether there is fragmentation ) such a weighting",
    "might introduce an artificial bias by amplifying the random noise of higher - weighted models .",
    "in the same way as in the models of @xcite of isolated circumstellar discs , very low - mass binary systems can also form in gentle three - body encounters between low - mass objects in the disc .",
    "such a triple in - orbit encounter occurred during the x002 computation about 8,000 years after the fly - by , as shown in figure [ imgxx02 ] where a 4  au binary system composed of 0.09  and 0.10  objects forms through a triple encounter .",
    "this binary remains bound to the host star in an orbit of about 100  au .",
    "these separations are consistent with the observations of vlms binaries according to which the most probable separation is around 3  au ( see , e.g. , figure 10 in @xcite ) .",
    "another binary - forming mechanism was unveiled during calculation e003 ( see table  [ tab : results ] ) . a 2  au binary , consisting of a vlms of 0.09  and a bd with 0.013  , formed through a grazing encounter of circum - substellar accretion envelopes , which subsequently evolve into a circumbinary disc .",
    "the event is shown in a sequence plot in figure  [ imge003 ] . in two similar events in run x006 ,",
    "two accreting clumps merged to a single one of about 0.03  9600  yrs after the fly - by , and 6000  yrs later this body and a third one got captured into a binary of about 5  au separation , probably involving both triple encounter and grazing collision .",
    "the masses at the end of the calculation are 0.03 and 0.04  .",
    "binaries formed via these processes may later be separated from their host star in a subsequent encounter with another star as already discussed for single substellar companions @xcite , or , possibly , by dynamical interaction with more massive companions in the same system .",
    "these models produce 55 systems of bds and vlmss , and 3 binaries giving a binary of @xmath89 , whereby the binaries have semi - major axes of 4 , 2 and 5  au .",
    "thus , while the separations are quite consistent with the observed vlms and bd binaries , the present theoretical binary fraction is somewhat low .      in a previous study @xcite we found that the strength of the perturbation increases with decreasing eccentricity and inclination",
    "this agrees with results of an sph parameter study by @xcite .",
    "while disc - disc collisions produce most objects due to shock formation @xcite , coplanar encounters increase the effectiveness of the tidal perturbations which cause our discs to fragment .",
    "this is a consequence of the low relative velocity between the perturber and the perturber - facing parts of the disc in coplanar encounters , and thus a longer tidal exposure time .",
    "while drag forces in disc - disc collisions are larger for larger collisional velocities the tidal force does not depend on the velocity , and therefore the total amount of tidally transferred momentum for a given flyby distance is larger for slower encounters , i.e. , for those with lower eccentricity .",
    "our computations show that the tidal perturbations of massive ( otherwise stable ) discs can form massive planets and bds .",
    "previous computations had assumed the interaction of two massive discs @xcite , reducing the probability of such an event dramatically .",
    "our scenario only requires a single extended disc .",
    "this scenario can produce very low - mass companions at large distances from the primary star , and may help explain recent direct detections of massive planets orbiting at @xmath90  au , far beyond where core accretion could have formed them , as well as intermediate @xcite and distant @xcite bd companions to stars .",
    "like @xcite we are also able to form bd binaries through three body encounters within the disc , and in addition , through dissipative encounters .",
    "but the required disc mass is considerably smaller , by about 3040 , since even initially stable discs do fragment upon perturbation in our calculations .",
    "the mass function of companions formed by this process is in good agreement with that of self - fragmentation and with the separate substellar imf deduced in @xcite .",
    "however , the volume of the current results does not allow robust statistical tests of the normalization of this sub - stellar imf relative to the stellar imf . nevertheless , the obtained results are in remarkable agreement both with the form of the substellar imf and the binary properties in the bd and vlms regime , although the binary fraction is somewhat low ( section [ ssec : binfrac ] ) .",
    "more computations will have to be performed at different resolutions ( up to a million particles ) to enhance quantity as well as quality of the data .",
    "furthermore , it has to be noted that triggered fragmentation is probably responsible only for a fraction of disc - fragmentation events while a good fraction may be triggered simply by over - feeding of an accreting disc towards self - fragmentation .",
    "although the borders of the parameter subspace suitable for triggered fragmentation are not yet fully determined the current findings show that encounters of a higher inclination than 45 degrees , outside 600  au or with eccentricities above 2 are generally unlikely to trigger fragmentation for the disc type studied here .",
    "the same holds true for perturbers of less than 0.3  .    by combining all these limits of the parameter space",
    "one can estimate the fraction of random encounters with a mutual periastron below 500  au that are suitable for fragmentation of the analysed disc type .",
    "if a characteristic velocity dispersion of @xmath91 and an upper stellar mass limit of 10  within the host cluster is assumed only about 3  of all encounters below 500  au lead to fragmentation .",
    "however , discs with even only slightly larger mass or lower background temperature may be pushed much easily to fragmentation , probably enlarging the parameter space significantly .",
    "furthermore , other perturbing effects like stellar winds or supernova shock waves , which might influence large volumes within the host cluster at once , are not covered by this study , nor are the effects of dust .",
    "all objects formed in our calculations have masses above 0.01  or 10  and are thus above the masses typically assumed for planets .",
    "however , we can not rule out at the moment that also objects below 0.01  may form through fragmentation , especially around lower - mass host stars which heat the inner disc region much less than more massive ones .",
    "another critical point may be the resolution limits ( although the local jeans mass is well resolved even in the inner disc region , as discussed in section [ ssec : sph ] ) .",
    "it has to be emphasized , that planet formation probably typically takes place in the inner disc region through core - accretion @xcite which are less influenced by the perturbation unless companions formed through it migrate into these inner regions .",
    "there might still be significant impacts on the outcome of planet formation for stellar encounters , though .",
    "even temporary gravitational instabilities that do not collapse into a brown dwarf or planet directly may induce the formation of substellar companions down to kuiper - belt objects by induced vorticity and subsequent dust trapping @xcite .",
    "also the development of baroclinic vortices may be altered under the influence of tidal perturbations , either inhibiting or promoting the formation of dust aggregates .",
    "this mechanism may even work in typical protoplanetary discs and is subject of our ongoing research . according to solar system architecture @xcite and radionuclide evidence ( @xcite ; @xcite",
    ", however , disagree ) the highly probable origin of our sun in a large star - forming region further emphasizes the importance of such scenarios .",
    "another fact worth to be discussed is the capture of disc material by the perturbing star . as mentioned in section [ sec :",
    "results ] about 0.003  =  3  are accreted by the perturber in a typical 500  au encounter like model e / x002 , while the amount of accreted gas can be as large as 10  , as in models e / x003 ( see table [ tab : sims ] ) .",
    "an even larger amount can be contained in a circumstellar disc or envelope around the perturber .",
    "although being smaller than typically assumed for the minimum - mass solar nebular ( mmsn , see @xcite ) this may still be sufficient for the formation of jupiter- or saturn - type planets around the perturber .",
    "since the orientation of this encounter - related accretion disc is not correlated to the stellar rotation of the perturber , this scenario may provide an explanation for highly inclined or even retrograde planets which have recently been detected @xcite .",
    "if the captured gas is accreted onto a pre - existing circumstellar disc of the perturber star this might even lead to the formation of planetary systems with multiple mutually inclined ( or even retrograde ) orbital planes .",
    "we have to emphasize at this point that gas capture from a massive extended circumstellar disc is only one of several possible gas capture scenarios , and is being observed in our work as a spin - off besides the main topic of this article .",
    "as the more general case , capture of material from any dense gas aggregate in the hosting star - forming region after the formation of the protostar itself may be a possible channel to form non - aligned planets .",
    "as the most general formulation , we note that the whole process of planet formation from the pre - stellar cloud in the context of stellar encounters in young star clusters to a fully established planetary system appears to be a discontinuous one in many cases , probably limiting the probability of regularly - shaped planetary systems with solar system - like architecture . this issue will be investigated in detail in future work .",
    "one issue not treated by our calculations is the varying protostar and disc mass during the accretion process . according to @xcite",
    "the growing disc may become temporarily unstable when the mass of the protostar is still negligibly small ( @xmath92 ) . in their nested - grid calculations , the disc fragments in the region of @xmath93  au , and even within 10  au .",
    "however , their simulations do not include a realistic treatment of radiative transfer .",
    "it is subject to future investigations whether accreting discs under perturbation may develop into planetary systems with solar - type architecture .",
    "furthermore , the influence of magnetic fields are completely ignored in our calculations .",
    "@xcite show that both hydromagnetic and thermomagnetic effects may amplify density waves in the disc into instability , and may provide an effective viscosity via turbulence which may assist accretion onto the star .",
    "observations of tidally perturbed fragmenting discs would surely be the best confirmation of this scenario . due to the short duration of the flyby of only about 10,000 years",
    "the chance of such an event to be caught in the act is small .",
    "it may , however , be possible to identify encounter - triggered fragmentation if observers succeed in detecting the typical tidal arms around the disc - hosting star as well as smaller amounts of non - circular filaments around a close - by star indicating it as a candidate perturber star .",
    "such structures may be detectable with future high - resolution instruments like alma in star - forming regions like the onc .",
    "another possibility is to target fu orionis stars which are thought to be undergoing enhanced accretion , such enhanced accretion may be caused by the perturbation of discs by a close encounter .",
    "in a series of sph calculations we have shown that massive ( @xmath94 ) , extended ( @xmath1 ) circumstellar discs can be stable when isolated , but fragment when perturbed by a moderately close and slightly inclined stellar encounter .",
    "binaries formed in two cases via triple encounters of companions and via grazing encounters of accreting envelopes .",
    "this agrees with binary formation in self - fragmenting discs @xcite .",
    "we further found that the mass distribution of companions formed in discs is in agreement with the canonical substellar imf as a separate population @xcite .",
    "we have , however , to note that direct tidally induced fragmentation is probably only responsible for a fraction of all disc fragmentation events due to the relatively small orbital parameter subset that is suitable for fragmentation of discs of about 0.5  .",
    "more massive discs are expected to be more prone to fragmentation even due to weak perturbations , but are also more likely to reach the limit for self - fragmentation .",
    "this study , however , shows that tidal perturbations do not necessarily inhibit fragmentation but are instead capable of inducing fragmentation in disc that otherwise would silently disperse or be accreted by the central star without ever experiencing fragmentation .",
    "the perturber star may accrete gas from the target circumstellar disc and may form planets on misaligned or even counter - rotating orbits with respect to the stellar spin .",
    "future work will analyse discs with different masses and more or less massive host stars as well .",
