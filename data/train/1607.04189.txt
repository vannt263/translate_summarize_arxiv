    "a prominent direction in atomic physics is to use optically trapped quantum gases to gain insight into many - body interacting problems . over the last decade or so",

    "the physics of frustrated systems is among the most active areas in the field of many - body interacting systems .",
    "ring - exchange models , originally proposed for studies of magnetism in helium-3 , have surged recently because of the interest in the study of frustrated spin systems and their relation with gauge theory .",
    "@xcite in particular , the competition between ring - exchange and conventional hopping terms has been studied intensively.@xcite these studies were motivated by the various exotic phases that were expected to be observed under the influence of ring - exchange terms .",
    "most notably the hunt for spin liquids , and bose - liquids  a compressible critical phase without boson condensation in a numerically tractable model has been a reigning theme in the simulation of boson and spin models .    besides the theoretical interest in possible exotic phases , the potential of an experimental realization of boson systems with high order ring exchange coupling is tantalizing .",
    "recently , triangular optical lattices have been realized experimentally by using three intersecting laser beams in a plane @xcite .",
    "thus , this opens the avenue for the study of ultracold atoms in frustrated lattices .",
    "in addition , the realization of ring - exchange coupling has also been proposed theoretically@xcite .",
    "therefore , the ring exchange model in a triangular lattice is a possible candidate for experimental realization .    in order to elucidate the effect of ring - exchange processes in a triangular lattice , we perform quantum monte carlo simulations for the bose - hubbard model with a four - site ring - exchange term with a diamond configuration , as opposed to the bow tie configuration in a prior study@xcite .",
    "the model contains a rich phase diagram by tuning the four parameters which adjust the hopping , the nearest neighbor repulsion , the ring exchange , and the chemical potential . in the classical limit",
    ", the model has a massively degenerate ground state .",
    "each ground state configuration has one unsatisfied bond at each triangular plaquette . the quantum fluctuation introduced by the hopping destroy this degeneracy , and depending upon the filling , either a supersolid or a superfluid phase is formed . on the other hand",
    ", one can introduce quantum fluctuations via the ring exchange .",
    "it has been suggested that the model in this limit could become a spin liquid such as that of the @xmath1 fractional quantum hall liquid.@xcite we will demonstrate that the spin liquid phase is preempted by the non - zero superfluid for a very small value of hopping .",
    "the main effect of the ring exchange term is the suppression of the diagonal ordering in the supersolid .",
    "the paper is organized as the following . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the detail of the model and the numerical method we used .",
    "in contrast to the simulation of the standard bose hubbard model , the higher order ring exchange leads to a complicated hamiltonian which is particularly well suited to be solved with the method we used  stochastic green function . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the quantities we measure by identifying different phase transitions of the model .",
    "we pay particular attention to the calculation of the superfluid density on the triangular lattice , which does not have orthonormal basis vectors . in the section iv , we provide the numerical results and the phase diagram .",
    "section v is the conclusion of the paper .",
    "the model we consider consists of hard - core bosons on a two - dimensional triangular lattice ( fig .",
    "[ triangularlattice ] ) .",
    "the bravais lattice is spanned by the basis vectors @xmath2 with lengths chosen as unity , and the reciprocal lattice is spanned by the vectors @xmath3 with lengths @xmath4 .",
    "allows the particles to hop between near - neighboring sites .",
    "the ring - exchange term @xmath5 performs a correlated hopping of two particles within the same diamond .",
    "this process is possible only if the diamond contains exactly two particles that are either opposite first - neighbors ( green diamond ) or second - neighbors ( blue and red diamonds ) .",
    "the presence of a pair of first - neighboring particles is penalized by the potential @xmath6 ( yellow ) . for a given diamond @xmath7 we label the sites in a counterclockwise fashion , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ,",
    "starting from one of the opposite first - neighbors ( cyan diamond).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the hamiltonian takes the form ( we use periodic boundary conditions ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the creation and annihilation operators of a hard - core boson on site @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the number operator on site @xmath15 .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators of hard - core bosons satisfy fermionic anti - commutation rules when acting on the same site , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and bosonic commutation rules when acting on different sites , @xmath20=0 $ ] , @xmath21=0 $ ] , @xmath22=0 $ ] .",
    "the sums @xmath23 are over all distinct pairs of neighboring sites @xmath15 and @xmath24 , and the sum @xmath25 is over all diamonds with all possible orientations ( fig .",
    "[ triangularlattice ] , blue , green , red ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 controls the kinetic energy , and @xmath5 controls the intensity of the ring - exchange term . because ring - exchange processes are possible only if the particles are nearby each other , the ring - exchange term acts as an effective attractive potential and can lead to instabilities@xcite .",
    "the system is stabilized by the presence of the repulsive potential @xmath6 between first - neighbors .    in order to solve the model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) we perform quantum monte carlo simulations by using the stochastic green function ( sgf ) algorithm@xcite with directed updates@xcite .",
    "the sgf method allows us to perform simulations in the canonical ensemble as well as in the grand - canonical ensemble@xcite . in the following",
    "we take advantage of this flexibility . for simulations in the grand - canonical ensemble",
    "we add the usual term @xmath27 to the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath28 , where the chemical potential @xmath29 allows us to control the average number of particles . in order to study the different phases of the system",
    ", we measure the dimensionless superfluid density @xmath30 .",
    "it was recently shown@xcite that the well - known formulas that express the superfluid density as a function of the response of the free energy to a boundary phase twist@xcite or to the fluctuations of the winding number@xcite are valid only for a particular class of hamiltonians . in the case of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , it is easy to see that the ring - exchange term conserves the center - of - mass of the system , and therefore commutes with the second - quantized position operator . as a result , the condition  ( 34 ) of ref . is satisfied , allowing the superfluid density to be expressed as a function of the winding number as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the winding numbers measured along @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the inverse temperature ( see eq .",
    "( a12 ) of ref . ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize here that  ( [ newrhos ] ) is different from the expression@xcite that is sometimes improperly applied to lattices with non - orthonormal primitive vectors .",
    "this is due to the fact that the expression of the laplacian in non - orthonormal coordinates is associated to a change of the energy scale that must be reflected in the expression of the superfluid density , and that the non - diagonal metric tensor results in correlations between the winding numbers in the two primitive directions@xcite .",
    "we also measure the static structure factor @xmath37 , with @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the linear size of the lattice and @xmath40 is the dimensionless density of particles .",
    "the subtraction of @xmath41 in the above expression is meant to get rid of the bragg peaks , that is to say @xmath42 for @xmath43 with @xmath44 integers , and does not affect the value of @xmath45 . in order to capture the ground state properties , we use an inverse temperature @xmath46 .",
    "we note that the model  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is particle - hole symmetric , which allows us to restrict our study to densities @xmath47 $ ] . by substituting into ( [ hamiltonian ] ) the creation and annihilation operators of holes , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ,",
    "it is straightforward to show that the energy @xmath50 as a function of the density @xmath41 satisfies : @xmath51 by definition , at zero temperature , we have @xmath52 , from which we deduce : @xmath53 in particular , at half - filling , we have the exact result @xmath54 , which is independent of @xmath26 and @xmath5 . since the energy of the system with a single particle is @xmath55 , it follows that the system is empty for @xmath56 and completely filled for @xmath57 , independent of the value of @xmath5 .",
    "simulations of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) are made difficult by ( i ) the high number of non - diagonal hamiltonian terms ( six kinetic terms and six ring - exchange terms per site ) , ( ii ) the quartic nature of the ring - exchange term that couples four sites and affects two worldlines at a time , and ( iii ) the geometry of the ring - exchange term that introduces a competition between the formation of pairs of first neighbors and pairs of second neighbors .",
    "nevertheless , we are able to simulate the model with sizes up to @xmath58 .",
    "our first main result is that the ring - exchange term does not have the expected effect .",
    "it does not destroy superfluidity , at least not for reasonable values of @xmath5 . on the contrary , starting from a solid phase with zero superfluid density , the ring - exchange term breaks the solid order and restores superfluidity as its magnitude is increased .",

    "we conclude that the system is always superfluid when @xmath5 is dominant , and that only a competition with @xmath6 can produce other phases .",
