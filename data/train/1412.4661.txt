    "the equation of motion is thus simply the force balance between hydrodynamic ( @xmath13 ) , repulsive ( @xmath14 ) , and contact ( @xmath15 ) forces which depend on the many - body position and velocity vectors @xmath16 and @xmath17 : @xmath18 the hydrodynamic forces consist of two components , a drag due to the motion relative to the surrounding fluid , @xmath19 , and a resistance to the deformation imposed by the flow , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the normalized strain rate tensor .",

    "this is a substantial advantage over the common technique of stress control using feedback , which adapts the shear rate based on the results of previous time steps .",

    "however , when @xmath98 , the roots have a positive real part , which means that the uniform shear flow is unstable .",

    "this can be understood if we decompose the stress response : the stress increase in the bulk just after the perturbation at @xmath124 can not have its origin from contacts , because the microstructural reorganization needed to accommodate the stress change through a contact network takes time to build up .",
    "the initial stress response is of hydrodynamic origin , and this component of the stress increases only upon an increase of the shear rate . as a consequence ,",
    "if the reynolds number is small enough , on the inertial time scale the suspension always behaves like a stable fluid that flows faster with increased applied stress .",
    "our numerical simulations and the linear stability analysis indicate that it may be possible to observe the s - shaped rheology in experiments , and s - shaped flow curves have recently been observed for a neutrally - buoyant suspension of spheres  @xcite , although the simulation does not capture the hysteresis and rate - dependent onset of the re - entrant portion of the flow curve seen in these experiments . in some stress - controlled experiments the dst shows up in the @xmath5 curve as an intermediate plateau with @xmath9 .",
    "the reynolds numbers involved in these experiments are often within the range for which our stability analysis predicts a stable uniform shear flow , so deep stable s - shaped flow curves would be noticed in the experimental data . for polymer beads in glycol",
    "@xcite and comb polymer coated pmma beads in various organic solvents  @xcite at volume fractions similar to the ones studied in this article , experiments show first a decrease and then a plateau for the shear rate above the discontinuous shear thickening onset stress . for precipitated calcium carbonate suspensions , a linear decrease of the shear rate",
    "is sometimes observed  @xcite . a recent experiment on fluidized gypsum suspensions in water",
    "@xcite shows the arching flow curves associated with shear jamming resembling the ones we obtain in this work for @xmath125 .",
    "it then seems that the decreasing flow curve is stable under some conditions , but that most of the time it is hidden by another phenomenon leading to a shear rate plateau .",
    "our stability analysis is highly restrictive , and the absence of non - monotonic flow curves in some experiments could be a consequence of another type of instability . to this end , a stability analysis extended to at least two dimensions would be valuable , but for now we are limited by the rather simplistic constitutive connection between the microstructure and the rheology . furthermore , the `` order parameter '' @xmath74 is a scalar , and we neglect the volume fraction field and its fluctuations .",
    "finally , another important point may be the neglect of the small but finite macroscopic elasticity , which can stem from a conservative interaction between particles or a finite brownian motion : this elasticity can sometimes cause an instability  @xcite .",
