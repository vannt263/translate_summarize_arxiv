    "peridynamics ( pd ) , originally devised in 1999 by s. a. silling @xcite is is a relatively new approach to solve problems in solid mechanics .",
    "in contrast to the most popular numerical methods for solving continuum mechanics problems , namely the finite element method or the finite volume method , pd does not require a topologically connected mesh of elements .",
    "additionally , pd incorporates the description of damage and material failure from the outset . within the context of mesh - free methods",
    ", peridynamics can be classified as a total - lagrangian collocation method with nodal integration .",
    "pd features two classes of interaction models , so called bond - based materials and state - based materials . in the bond - based case , interactions exist as spring - like forces between pairs of particles .",
    "the interactions only depend on the relative displacement ( and potentially its history ) of the interacting particle pair and are thus independent of other particles .",
    "this is in contrast to the state - based model where pair - wise interactions also depend on the cumulative displacement state of all other particles within the neighborhoods of the two particles which form the pair .    ,",
    "centered on the source node .",
    "the interactions are termed bonds .",
    "peridynamics is a non - local method , because not only nearest , or , adjacent , neighbors are considered .",

    "bonds exist between node @xmath0 and all other nodes @xmath2 which are inside @xmath3 . upon deformation of the bonds ,",
    "forces are projected along the reference bond vectors @xmath4 such that solid material behavior is obtained.,width=384 ]    the scope of this paper is to assess the accuracy and convergence of the linear - elastic , bond - based pd model with brittle failure , known as the prototype micro - brittle ( pmb ) model in the literature .",
    "we investigate the discrete equations of this model , suitable for numerical implementation .",
    "it is shown that the widely used discretization approach incurs rather large errors .",
    "motivated by this observation , a new discretization scheme is proposed , which significantly increases the numerical accuracy . as an additional result , we derive equations to treat the interactions between differently sized particles , i.e. , a non - homogeneous discretization spacing .",
    "this presents an important step forward for the applicability of the pmb model to complex geometries , where it is desired to model interesting parts with a fine resolution ( small particle spacings ) and other parts with a coarse resolution in order to gain numerical efficiency .",
    "we begin by introducing the basic terminology of bond - based pd . in order to be consistent with the major part of the existing pd literature , we use the following symbols : a coordinate in the reference configuration",
    "is denoted with @xmath5 , deformed ( current ) coordinates are denoted by @xmath6 , such that the displacement is given by @xmath7 .",
    "bold mathematical symbols like the preceding ones denote vectors , while the same mathematical symbol in non - bold font refers to its euclidean norm , e.g. @xmath8 .",
    "the governing equation for a pd continuum is given by @xmath9\\ ,          \\mathrm{d } v_{\\vec{x } ' } ,      \\label{gcganzenmueller::eqn : peridynamic_energy_continuous}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the energy density at a point located at @xmath5 in the reference configuration , and displaced at time @xmath11 by an amount @xmath12 .",
    "+ is the _ micropotential _ , which describes the strain energy due to the relative displacement of a pair of points located at @xmath5 and @xmath13 .",
    "the assumption that the strain energy density depends only on pairs of interacting volume elements leads to the restriction of a fixed poisson ratio of @xmath14 in 2d ( 1/4 in 3d ) .",
    "the function @xmath15 is a weight function which modulates the pair interaction strength depending on spatial separation , and @xmath16 is the volume associated with a point .    referring to fig .",

    "horizon_. within the pd picture , the strain energy is conceptually stored in _",
    "bonds _ that are defined between all pairs of points @xmath17 located within @xmath3 .",
    "thus , a bond vector in the reference configuration is given by @xmath18 , and the relative bond displacement due to some deformation at time @xmath11 is @xmath19 .",
    "the bond distance vector in the current configuration is therefore written as @xmath20 .    with this notation , and dropping the explicit dependence on time , equation  ( [ gcganzenmueller::eqn : peridynamic_energy_continuous ] ) is written in a more compact form as @xmath21    the factor of @xmath22 in the above equation arises because each bond is defined twice , once originating at @xmath5 and pointing to @xmath13 , and again via its antisymmetric counterpart pointing from @xmath23 to @xmath13 .",
    "the forces within the bond - based pd continuum are obtained by taking the derivative of the micropotential with respect to the bond distance vector .",
    "the _ microforce _ between two bonded points is thus @xmath24 yielding the acceleration @xmath25 of a point with mass density @xmath26 due to all its neighbors within @xmath3 : @xmath27    for implementation in a computer code , equations  ( [ gcganzenmueller::eqn : peridynamic_energy_continuous_compact ] ) and ( [ gcganzenmueller::eqn : peridynamic_acceleration_continuous ] ) need to be discretized .",
    "this process requires the division of the continuous body to be simulated into a number of distinct nodes with a given subvolume , subject to the constraint that the sum of all subvolumes equals the total volume of the body .",
    "these nodes are termed particles henceforth and the peridynamic bonds exist between these particles .",
    "the most straightforward discretization approach is nodal integration , which is used in almost all publications dealing with pd up to date . referring to fig .",

    "the object of this work is to quantify the errors incurred by this approach , but before doing so , we introduce a specific form of the pairwise force function which is compatible with linear elastic continuum behavior and supports a brittle fracture mechanism .",
    "in order to establish the link with linear elasticity , i.e. , a hookean solid , silling @xcite introduced the _ prototype microbrittle material _",
    "( pmb ) model , with a microforce that depends linearly on the bond stretch @xmath30 .",
    "the bond stretch can be thought of as a pairwise one dimensional strain description of the material , and a full strain tensor can indeed be derived from an ensemble of bond stretches @xcite .",
    "a microforce which is linear in @xmath31 is therefore in agreement with hooke s law .    here",

    "displacement . @xmath34",
    "note that the expressions for the microforce and the micropotential differ from silling s original work by a factor of @xmath35 .",
    "this change is purely for consistency reasons , because , in our opinion , the energy density should not contain a reference to a length scale .",
    "the modification will be absorbed into the proportionality constant @xmath33 which is yet to be determined .",
    "the weight function is chosen as a simple step function , @xmath36 which allows for a compact notation as it can be absorbed into the summation operator of the discretized expressions , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "the effects of using different weight functions have been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "no significant benefits were observed when using different forms of the weight function for the purpose of simulating structural response problems , however , the weight function affects the dispersion of waves .",
    "damage and failure are incorporated by keeping track of the history of a bond stretch state .",
    "we fail individual bonds by permanently and irreversibly deleting them once they are stretched beyond a critical stretch value @xmath38 .",
    "the remaining constant @xmath33 is determined by requiring the peridynamic expression for the energy density , equation  ( [ gcganzenmueller::eqn : peridynamic_energy_continuous_compact ] ) to be consistent with the result from linear elasticity theory , @xmath39 : @xmath40 in the 3d case of pure dilation or compression , c.f .",
    "equation  ( [ gcganzenmueller::eqn : wel3d ] ) in the appendix , we have @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the bulk modulus and @xmath31 is the strain along any of the cartesian directions . note that for isotropic strain field , the strain and the stretch of any bond coincide . integrating the peridynamic energy density expression for this strain field in spherical coordinates ,",
    "we have @xmath43 equating this result with the continuum theory expression for the elastic strain energy , the constant @xmath33 is obtained as : @xmath44 this approach of determining @xmath33 is correct for the continuous integral expressions upon which pd theory is based .",
    "however , in combination with the discrete expression given by equation  ( [ gcganzenmueller::eqn : peridynamic_energy_density_discretized ] ) , the results of a numerical computation of the energy density are inaccurate , as exact analytic integration is combined with piecewise constant approximation of the integrals .",
    "the errors incurred by this approach are rather large and , what is worse , does not converge to zero upon increasing @xmath1 or the number of particles . before we quantify these errors",

    "is defined as a smooth region in space given by the radial cutoff @xmath1 . for a piecewise constant approximation of the integrals of the peridynamic theory",
    "suitable for computer implementation , the neighborhood also needs to be defined in a discrete manner : here , we define the piecewise constant neighborhood approximation as the volume of all particles touched by the radial cutoff @xmath1.,width=384 ]    instead of deriving the proportionality constant @xmath33 by exact analytic integration , we propose to use the same integral approximation as is used for discretizing the pd energy density integral or acceleration expression .",
    "this means that we use a piecewise constant approximation for equation  ( [ gcganzenmueller::energy_balance_pd_continuum ] ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ gcganzenmueller::fig : pd_neighborhood_piecewise ] : @xmath45 inserting the micropotential and the 3d pure dilation result for the continuum strain energy density in the above equation , we obtain the proportionality constant as @xmath46 in this formulation , the dependence of @xmath47 on the horizon @xmath1 is now only implicit through the number of particles contributing to the sum in the denominator .",
    "a particle at a free surface of a body will have a different number of neighbors compared to a particle in the bulk .",
    "this effect is accounted for with our discrete expression for @xmath47 , as opposed to the original expression , equation  ( [ gcganzenmueller::eqn : c_integral ] ) , which is only valid for the bulk .",
    "this normalization is similar to a shepard correction of the shape functions encountered in other meshless methods such as smooth - particle hydrodynamics @xcite , where it restores @xmath48 consistency , i.e. , the ability to approximate a constant field . at the same time",
    ", it is this local dependence which allows us to easily introduce different spatial resolutions and horizons .",
    "it is important at this point to discuss the conservation of momentum . in the original formulation of the pmb model ,",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath33 is the same for all interacting particles .",
    "therefore , @xmath49 , and , as the forces are aligned with the distance vector between particles @xmath0 and @xmath2 , both linear and angular momentum are conserved . in the approach",
    "proposed here , @xmath50 is not necessarily equal to @xmath51 , as the particle volume sum over @xmath52 is not guaranteed to equal the particle volumes sum over @xmath53 .",
    "thus @xmath54 , in general .",
    "we therefore enforce symmetry in the following manner : @xmath55 the full expressions for the potential energy of a particle and its acceleration , as required for implementation in a computer code , are then @xmath56 and @xmath57",

    "we show that the energy density and speed of sound are exactly reproduced using our method , while the original method yields considerable errors .",
    "finally , we investigate a mode - i crack opening example with our modified pd scheme , where a failure criterion based on the griffith energy release rate correctly reproduces results from linear elasticity fracture mechanics theory .      the ability to reproduce",

    "we measure the peridynamic strain energy density , @xmath60 by summing over all bond energies and dividing by the cube volume .",

    "we observe that the original approach shows relative errors in excess of 30% .",
    "what is worse , is that the errors do not converge monotonously as one increases the horizon , which is the only resolution variable available due to the scale invariance implied by the absence of free surfaces .",

    "following @xcite , the theoretical value for the longitudinal speed of sound is @xmath73 where @xmath74 $ ] is the shear modulus , and @xmath75 is poisson s ratio .",
    "as the 3d peridynamic model under consideration has a fixed poisson ratio @xmath76 @xcite , we obtain @xmath77 .",
    "[ gcganzenmueller::fig : sound_wave ] compares this theoretical prediction with the results of peridynamics simulation that employ the original analytical integration approach for determining the amplitude constant @xmath33 of the micropotential , and the normalization approach proposed here .",
    "it is evident from this comparison that the original approach severely overestimates the wave propagation speed .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation , that the original approach overestimates the energy density , leading to a system which is effectively too stiff .",
    "in contrast , the normalization procedure for determining @xmath33 reproduces the theoretical wave propagation speed very well .        to investigate the performance of the normalization approach in the case of non - uniform particle spacing ,",

    "[ gcganzenmueller::fig : tet_mesh ] shows a section of the bar in both the tetrahedron and particle representation . to realize a challenging test ,",
    "the tetrahedral mesh was intentionally generated such that small angles and large variations in the tetrahedron volumes are achieved .",
    "the resulting particle configuration is therefore strongly polydisperse with a ratio of smallest to largest radius of 100 . because no characteristic length - scale ( such as the lattice spacing above ) is now present ,",
    "we adjust the peridynamic horizon for each particle separately , such that the neighborhood contains 30 neighbors .",
    "three different initial tetrahedron meshes of different resolutions are used to conduct a convergence study for our pmb normalization approach .",
    "the coarsest mesh contains 17211 tetrahedrons , and two more finely resolved meshes are obtained by repeated splitting of the elements , such that the finest mesh has 70381 elements .    , but instead of a regular mesh we employ the discretization approach via a stochastic tetrahedral mesh outlined in fig .",
    "[ gcganzenmueller::fig : tet_mesh ] .",
    "the vertical dashed line indicates the position where the pressure pulse should be , according to the exact wave propagation speed .",
    "the peridynamic simulations show convergence to this exact result upon increasing the number of particles used for discretizing the bar.,width=384 ]    the results are given in fig .",
    "[ gcganzenmueller::fig : sound_wave_tet_mesh ] .",
    "we observe that pressure pulse is much broader when compared to the results of the uniform particle configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ gcganzenmueller::fig : sound_wave ] , and that oscillations travelling behind the main pulse are more pronounced .",
    "this is not surprising , as it is well known that wave propagation is affected by discretization effects : partial reflections occur always when a wave is transmitted between regions of space that are discretized using different resolutions .",
    "these reflections cause dispersion and reduction in the observed wave speed propagation speed . as the discretization length scale becomes small compared to the wavelength ,",
    "these effects disappear .",
    "we therefore expect convergence of the location of the pressure pulse to its theoretical position at a given time , and return of its shape back to the initial gaussian shape , as the particles are more finely resolved . the simulation results shown in fig .",
    "[ gcganzenmueller::fig : sound_wave_tet_mesh ] support these statements : as the resolution is enhanced , the wave speed tends towards its theoretical value and the pressure pulse shows less oscillations . we therefore conclude that our approach of handling interactions between peridynamic particles of different size is correct .      traditionally , continuum mechanics is formulated using a set of partial differential equations which describe temporal and spatial evolution .",
    "these equations require smooth solutions with well defined gradients .",
    "therefore , discontinuities in the material , such as cracks , can not emerge naturally within the solution manifold .",
    "in contrast , peridynamics circumvents this problem by employing an integral description for the evolution equations . due to its simple form",
    ", the pmb model in particular is well suited to model arbitrary crack initiation and propagation phenomena .",
    "a number of studies have used the pmb model to study crack propagation speed , crack branching as well as coalescence of individual cracks @xcite . however , to the best of these authors knowledge , no quantitative assessment of the accuracy of pmb simulations relative to analytical solutions for modelling crack initiation and propagation has been published to date .",
    "the main reason for this shortcoming is probably the fact that the original formulation of the pmb model using the analytic integration approach for determining the micropotential amplitude inflicts unacceptably large errors already for the energy density .",
    "this implies that no quantitatively correct modelling of crack processes could be carried using the original pmb approach .",
    "however , the above cited studies demonstrate that the original pmb model is very well suited to qualitatively model complex crack growth phenomena , including the interaction of multiple cracks with each other . in this section",
    ", we demonstrate the our normalization approach for determining the micropotential amplitude can be used to quantitatively reproduce analytical solutions obtained from linear elastic fracture mechanics ( lefm ) theory .",
    "a useful crack propagation theory for numerical simulations must be based on criteria which are independent of the discretization length scale .",
    "if length scale - dependent measures such as stress are used instead , no convergence of the loads required to propagate a crack can be achieved because finer resolution always implies a higher stress concentrations .",
    "one useful criterion is the griffith energy release rate , i.e. , the energy required to separate a body by generating two free surfaces , one to either side of a crack area .",
    "the energy release rate is defined as energy divided by area and is therefore an intensive measure for the resistance of a body against cracking . in the discrete",
    "setting of a numerical simulation , the energy release rate incorporates the discretization length scale and thus provides a failure criterion which is independent of discretization .",
    "this implies that a crack growth simulation based on such a failure criterion can converge upon discretization refinement .",
    "a peridynamic failure criterion based on the griffith energy release rate has been first published by silling and askari @xcite . here ,",
    "we roughly follow their approach , but restrict ourselves to plane - strain conditions as lefm theory provides useful analytical solutions to compare against in this case .    because pmb interactions are formulated in terms of bond - wise micropotentials , a failure criterion is required which links the micropotential to the energy release rate .",
    "such an expression can be obtained by considering a pure dilation stretch state of a peridynamic material and summing the energy stored in all those bonds which cross a hypothetical unit fracture surface .",
    "the resulting normalized energy per area , which is a function of the bond stretch and the bulk modulus , can be equated with the energy release rate . from this relation",
    "a critical bond stretch can be obtained at which the bond should fail in order to yield a given energy release rate .",
    "[ gcganzenmueller::fig:2d_crack_surface ] shows how peridynamic bonds which are connected to a particular central node interact across a hypothetical fracture surface .",
    "an interaction volume is defined as as the spatial volume occupied by these bonds . for a given fracture surface ,",
    "a manifold of interaction volumes exist .",
    "the magnitude of these volumes depends on the distance of the central node away from the fracture surface .",

    "tractions were realized by gradually applying opposite forces to the top and bottom row of particles , effecting a gradual stretch of the patch .",

    "nevertheless , we note that the simple normalized pmb model is highly successful at predicting the correct stress at the crack tip which causes the crack to grow .",
    "we have shown that the discrete implementations of the original formulation of the prototype - microbrittle model of linear elasticity in peridynamics suffers from severe inaccuracies .",
