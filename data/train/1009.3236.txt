    "the heisenberg algebra for a quantum mechanical system having one degree of freedom consists of three elements : the coordinate operator @xmath10 , the momentum operator @xmath11 , and the unit element @xmath12 .",
    "these three elements obey the single commutation relation @xmath13={\\bf 1}i \\label{e1}\\ ] ] this algebra possesses two independent discrete symmetries under which the commutation relation ( [ e1 ] ) remains invariant .",
    "the first symmetry , called parity ( space reflection ) , is represented by the linear operator @xmath14 , where @xmath15 . under the action of @xmath14 both @xmath10 and @xmath11 change sign : @xmath16 the second symmetry , called time reversal , is represented by the antilinear operator @xmath17 , where @xmath18 . under the action of @xmath17 both @xmath11 and @xmath19 change sign , but",
    "@xmath10 does not : @xmath20    in quantum mechanics the hamiltonian operator @xmath21 is expressed in terms of the operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 : @xmath22 .",
    "it is conventional to require that the hamiltonian be hermitian so that the eigenvalues of @xmath21 are real .",
    "however , in 1998 it was shown that the hamiltonian need not be hermitian for the eigenvalues to be real @xcite . in that paper",
    "the family of non - hermitian hamiltonians @xmath23 was introduced , and it was shown that the eigenvalues of these @xmath8-symmetric hamiltonians are real when the parameter @xmath24 . a rigorous proof of spectral reality is given in refs .",
    "the parametric range @xmath25 is referred to as a region of unbroken @xmath8 symmetry ; in this region all the eigenfunctions of @xmath21 are also eigenfunctions of the @xmath8 operator . in the parametric region @xmath26 some of the eigenvalues are complex ; this range of @xmath27 is said to be a region of broken @xmath8 symmetry .",
    "a second conventional reason for requiring that the hamiltonian @xmath21 be hermitian is that @xmath21 determines the time evolution of the theory , and if @xmath21 is hermitian , then the time evolution is unitary ( probability conserving ) .",
    "however , in 2002 it was shown that if the @xmath8 symmetry of a non - hermitian hamiltonian is unbroken , then the time evolution is unitary @xcite .    in general ,",
    "hermitian hamiltonians differ from @xmath8-symmetric hamiltonians in that the spectrum of a hermitian hamiltonian is always real while the spectrum of a non - hermitian @xmath8-symmetric hamiltonian often has a parametric region of unbroken @xmath8 symmetry where the eigenvalues are all real and a region of broken @xmath8 symmetry where some of the eigenvalues are complex .",
    "the boundary between these two regions is a phase transition , and this phase transition has recently been observed in several different laboratory experiments @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the algebra e2 , which is more complicated than the heisenberg algebra .",
    "this algebra has three elements , which are designated @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , and these elements obey the commutation relations @xmath28=iv,\\qquad [ v , j]=-iu,\\qquad [ u , v]=0 .   \\label{e5}\\ ] ] this operator algebra arises when one considers a two - dimensional quantum system restricted to a ring of radius @xmath29 .",
    "we can represent the operators @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 in polar form as @xmath30 where we have taken @xmath31 .",
    "the e2 algebra is more complicated than the heisenberg algebra ( [ e1 ] ) , but it reduces to the heisenberg algebra in the limit as @xmath32 @xcite .    like the heisenberg algebra",
    ", the e2 algebra is separately invariant under each of two different symmetries , parity @xmath14 and time reversal @xmath17 .",
    "we define a parity transformation as a reflection through the center of the ring .",
    "thus , a point on the ring is mapped to a point on the opposite side of the ring such that @xmath33 .",
    "then , under a parity transformation @xmath34 which clearly leaves ( [ e5 ] ) invariant @xcite .",
    "time reversal changes the sign of @xmath19 , and thus its effect is to reverse the sign of @xmath0 but to leave @xmath1 and @xmath2 invariant .",
    "thus , the time - reversal transformation @xmath35 also leaves the e2 algebra ( [ e5 ] ) invariant .",
    "this paper is organized very simply : in sec .  [ s2 ] we construct a hamiltonian in terms of the elements of the e2 algebra .",
    "this hamiltonian contains a coupling - constant parameter @xmath7 ; if @xmath7 is real , the hamiltonian is hermitian , and if @xmath7 is imaginary , the hamiltonian is non - hermitian but @xmath8 symmetric .",
    "we show that for real @xmath7 the eigenvalues are all real and that if @xmath7 is imaginary , there are regions of broken and unbroken @xmath8 symmetry . finally , in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] we give some brief concluding remarks and discuss possible future directions for research .",
    "the operators @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are hermitian , and thus it is easy to construct a hermitian hamiltonian in terms of these operators .",
    "one such hamiltonian is @xmath36 where @xmath7 is a real parameter . for this hamiltonian",
    ", the schrdinger eigenvalue differential equation takes the form @xmath37 which is the mathieu equation @xcite .",
    "this is the equation for a quantum pendulum .    to find the eigenvalues @xmath38 of ( [ e10 ] ) we must impose boundary conditions .",
    "the simplest such boundary conditions express the bosonic requirement that the eigenfunctions be single valued on the ring : @xmath39 however , instead of imposing the @xmath40-periodic boundary conditions in ( [ e11 ] ) , we can also impose the fermionic boundary requirement that the eigenfunctions be @xmath40 _ anti_-periodic : @xmath41 because these boundary conditions are homogeneous and the schrdinger equation ( [ e10 ] ) is symmetric under @xmath42 , the eigenfunctions will be either odd or even in @xmath43 .",
    "let us examine first the simple case @xmath44 . the general solution to ( [ e10 ] ) for this case is @xmath45 thus , there are four sets of eigenvalues : for odd bosonic eigenfunctions @xmath46 , and we get @xmath47 for even bosonic eigenfunctions @xmath48 , and we get @xmath49 for odd fermionic eigenfunctions @xmath46 , and we get @xmath50 for even fermionic eigenfunctions @xmath48 , and we get @xmath51    for @xmath52 we use mathematica to plot the eigenvalues as functions of @xmath7 .",
