    "it is well known that energy conditions play an important role in classical theory of general relativity and thermodynamics@xcite . in classical general relativity",
    "it is usually convenient and efficient to restrict a physical system to satisfy one or some of energy conditions for study , for example , in the proof of hawking - penrose singularity theorem@xcite , the positive mass theorem@xcite and so on , while in thermodynamics energy conditions are the bases for obtaining entropy bounds@xcite . among those energy conditions , the null energy condition is the weakest one which states that for any null vector @xmath5 the stress energy tensor @xmath6 should satisfy the relation @xmath7    in general , the violation of nec leads to the breakdown of causality in general relativity and the violation of the second law of thermodynamics@xcite .",
    "these pathologies require that the total stress tensor in a physical spacetime manifold should obey the nec . in the framework of the standard 4-dimensional friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology",
    "the nec implies @xmath8 , which in turn gives rise to a constraint on the equation of state of the universe ( eos ) @xmath0 defined as the ratio of pressure to energy density , @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we study the constraints on the dark energy models from the requirement of @xmath9 .    in the early universe with radiation dominant the eos of the universe",
    "@xmath10 is approximately equal to @xmath11 and in the matter dominant period @xmath10 is nearly zero , so nec is satisfied well .",
    "however when the dark energy component is not negligible we have @xmath12 where the subscripts ` @xmath13 ' and ` @xmath14 ' stand for matter and dark energy , respectively . with @xmath15 , inequality ( [ necd ] ) becomes @xmath16 from the inequality above , we can see that models of dark energy with @xmath17 such as the cosmological constant and the quintessence satisfy the nec , but the models with @xmath4 predicted for instance by the phantom theory where the kinetic term of the scalar field has a wrong sign does not .",
    "interestingly we can see that nec might be satisfied in models if @xmath4 stays for a short period of time during the evolution of the universe . in this paper",
    "we will show this happens in the quintom models of dark energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we will present three examples of the quintom models to show how the nec is satisfied and the section iii is the summary of the paper .",
    "quintom is a dynamical model of dark energy@xcite .",
    "it differs from the cosmological constant , quintessence@xcite , phantom@xcite , k - essence@xcite and so on in the determination of the cosmological evolution .",
    "although the current data in combination with the 3-year wmap@xcite , the recently released 182 snia gold sample@xcite and also other cosmological observational data show the consistence of the cosmological constant , it is worth noting that the dynamical dark energy models are not excluded and quintom dark energy is mildly favored ( for recent references see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the most salient feature of the quintom model is that its eos can smoothly cross @xmath18 .",
    "in this section we will study the implications of nec on the quintom models .",
    "working with three specific examples we will show the nec can indeed be satisfied .      with a simple calculation ,",
    "the inequality ( [ necde ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath19d\\ln a'\\right\\}+\\frac{\\omega_{m0}}{a^3}\\geq0~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscript ` 0 ' represents today s value .",
    "we firstly start with a phenomenological model with a parameterized eos which will be able to cross over @xmath18 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the scale factor which we normalize to be @xmath22 at present .",
    "one can see that when @xmath21 is equal to @xmath23 , the eos of dark energy crosses @xmath18 .",
    "this type of parametrization for the eos has been widely used in the literature@xcitefor the fitting of constraining the eos to the observational data .    inserting eq .",
    "( [ para1 ] ) into the inequality ( [ necdew ] ) , the nec puts a constraint on the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1:para ] , we take @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and then plot the evolution of the dark energy eos and also the eos of the universe respectively .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig1:para ] that the eos of dark energy @xmath28 crosses @xmath18 from below to above . in this case",
    "the eos of the universe @xmath0 evolves from zero which corresponds to the matter dominant epoch , and then reaches its minimal value during which the universe enters the dark energy dominant period , and finally returns to zero in the future .",
    "we can read directly from this figure that the minimal value of @xmath0 stays above @xmath18 which satisfies the nec .     with @xmath29 , and the eos @xmath0 for the universe as a function of @xmath30 . here in the numerical calculation",
    "we have taken @xmath26 and @xmath27 . ]",
    "one could take another example with a different parametrization of the eos : @xmath31 this example is different from the previous one since we introduce a square term of the scale factor which makes the eos @xmath28 crosses @xmath18 twice .",
    "taking proper values of those parameters , this model can give a scenario that dark energy stays in the phantom - like state only for a while and then returns to be quintessence - like .",
    "after taking the similar calculation , we plot the evolution of the eos of the model and the universe respectively in fig .",
    "[ fig2:para ] . in this example",
    "the eos of dark energy @xmath28 starts to evolve from quintessence - like in the past , and then enters the phantom - like state for a short period of time , and finally returns to above @xmath18 .",
    "we also find that @xmath0 behaves similar to that in fig .",
    "[ fig1:para ] .",
    "its value resides on zero in the past and in the future which means that matter have dominated and will dominate again the evolution of the universe .",
    "although @xmath0 runs away from zero during the evolution , its value keeps being larger than @xmath18 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2:para ] .",
    "therefore , this model can be consistent with the nec as well .     with @xmath32 , and the eos @xmath0 for the universe as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "here in the numerical calculation we have taken @xmath33 and @xmath34 . ]      building the field model of quintom dark energy is a challenge due to the no - go theorem which has been proved in ref .",
    "@xcite(also see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . this no - go theorem forbids a traditional scalar field model with a lagrangian of general form @xmath35 from having its eos cross over the cosmological constant boundary . according to this theorem ,",
    "dynamical models like quintessence , phantom and k - essence are unable to realize their eos cross @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , to realize a viable quintom field model in the framework of einstein s gravity theory , one needs to introduce extra degrees of freedom to the conventional theory with a single scalar field .",
    "the simplest quintom model is constructed by two scalars with one being quintessence - like and another phantom - like proposed firstly in ref .",
    "@xcite , and this model has been widely studied in detail later on . in recent years",
    "there have been a lot of activities in the theoretical study on building quintom models , such as a single scalar with high - derivative @xcite , vector field@xcite , extended theory of gravity@xcite , lorentz - violating dark energy models@xcite and so on , see e.g. @xcite .    in this section",
    "we investigate a two - scalar - field quintom model of dark energy in flat frw cosmology which is described by the action @xmath36~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ricci scalar of the universe , @xmath39 is the lagrangian of matter , @xmath40 is the lagrangian of dark energy , and the metric is in form of @xmath41 . here",
    "the field @xmath42 has a canonical kinetic term , but @xmath43 is a ghost field . with @xmath40 in ( [ lagrangede ] ) , we can easily obtain the energy density and the pressure of this model , @xmath44 where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time , and by the variational principle the einstein equations are given by @xmath45 since it is required that the total eos of the universe satisfies the nec , it is clear that the phantom component of this kind of model can only be dominant for a short while and hence it gives a constraint on choosing the potential of the phantom field . in the following numerical calculations , we will choose an appropriate potential of phantom field and different potentials of quintessence field , which can satisfy the nec and give various quintom scenarios .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3:double ] , we choose the potentials of quintessence and phantom field to be @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "here we normalize the fields with planck scale and choose @xmath48 to be @xmath49 . and @xmath50 to be @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "] during the evolution , the phantom field will climb up along its potential and become dominant because its energy density will increase while that of quintessence field will decrease .",
    "however , since there is a maximum of the potential , after reaching that point , the phantom field will stay on the top and stop affecting the evolvement of the universe . from the figure",
    ", we can see that after the eos of dark energy being less than @xmath18 today for a short while , it can exit in the future and actually approach to @xmath18 . in this case",
    "we read from the figure that the eos of the universe can be always larger than @xmath18 , and thus the nec can be easily satisfied .     for the two - scalar - field quintom dark energy with the potential @xmath53 , and the eos @xmath0 for the universe as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "here in the numerical calculation we have taken @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and the initial values are @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig4:double ] , we choose another potential form of the quintessence field to be @xmath62 with the phantom s potential unchanged .",
    "we can see from the figure that , similar to the reason above , phantom can only dominate the universe for a while , and due to different potential of quintessence , the eos of dark energy model behaves very differently .",
    "the figure shows that after the universe exit the phantom dominating phase , the quintessence will dominate the universe again , and the eos of dark energy will cross @xmath18 twice . in the future ,",
    "however , this eos will also become de - sitter like . in the whole process",
    ", the eos of the universe will always be above the cosmological constant boundary , and this model of quintom dark energy also satisfies the nec .",
    "for the two - scalar - field quintom dark energy with the potential @xmath63 , and the eos @xmath0 for the universe as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "here in the numerical calculation we have taken @xmath64 , @xmath55 , @xmath57 and the initial values are @xmath58 , @xmath65 , @xmath60 and @xmath66 . ]",
    "having presented the examples of two - scalar - field quintom models in consistent with the nec , we in this section consider a class of quintom models described by an effective lagrangian involving higher derivative operators .",
    "due to the contribution of higher derivative terms , this kind of models can give rise to an eos across @xmath18 as pointed out in ref .",
    "a connection of this type of quintom theory to the string theory has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "here we take the string - inspired model in @xcite for a detailed study to check whether it satisfies the requirement of the nec .",
    "the action of this quintom dark energy is given by @xmath67~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is a generalized version of  born - infeld \" action@xcite with the introduction of the @xmath68 term(see , for example , @xcite for derivation of the higher derivative term from string theory ) . to the lowest order ,",
    "the box - operator term @xmath69 is equivalent to the term @xmath70 when the tachyon is on the top of its potential .",
    "however when the tachyon rolls down from the top of the potential , these two terms exhibit different dynamical behavior .",
    "the two parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 in ( [ tachyonaction ] ) could be arbitrary in the case of the background flux being turned on @xcite .",
    "one interesting feature of this model is that it provides the possibility of its eos @xmath28 running across the cosmological constant boundary . in the following studies to make two parameters ( @xmath73 , @xmath68 ) dimensionless , it is convenient to redefine @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath48 is an energy scale of the effective theory of the field .    from ( [ tachyonaction ] )",

    "although in this case the phase space of quintom dark energy is constrained , we will show below that the inequality ( [ necdew ] ) can be satisfied easily . in the numerical study , we constrain the parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 so that when expanding the derivative terms in the square root to the lowest order the model in ( [ tachyonaction ] ) gives rise to a canonical kinetic term for the scalar field @xmath76 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath86 .    through calculating eqs .",
    "( [ tachyon1 ] ) , ( [ tachyon2 ] ) and the friedmann equations numerically and then comparing the results in the inequality ( [ necdew ] ) , we can judge whether a model is consistent with the nec .",
    "we first consider a model with the potential @xmath87 . in the calculation",
    "we normalize the fields @xmath76 and @xmath88 with the planck scale and choose the energy scale @xmath89 .",

    "the period of time for dark energy to be phantom - like is very short .",
