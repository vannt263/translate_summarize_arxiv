    "dealing with high - dimensional non - linear data is one of the key challenges in modern data analysis . in recent years",
    "a class of methods based on the mathematical notion of a manifold has become popular in machine learning , starting with the papers  @xcite .",
    "the underlying intuition is that a process with a small number of parameters will generate a low - dimensional surface in the potentially very high - dimensional space of features and that this situation is ubiquitous in real - world data .",
    "this idea is captured nicely by the technical notion of a smooth embedded riemannian manifold , which provides the first realistic model for general non - linear data",
    ". still it does not reflect certain important aspects of real data , which can be mathematically understood as singularities and boundaries .",
    "the most basic and , arguably , the most important singularity in real data is an _ intersection _",
    ", where two different manifolds come together in a region of space",
    ". this often happens in classification where two classes with presumably different structure can give rise to similar objects ( consider , e.g. , the similarity of mnist digits `` 7 '' and `` 1 '' on the right ) . another important type of singularity is a ( co - dimension one ) `` _ edge _ '' , which is ubiquitous in computer graphics ( think of an edge of the surface of a table ) and happens whenever the behavior of an underlying process changes rapidly beyond a certain point ( a `` phase transition '' ) .",
    "finally , _ boundaries _ occur when there are bounding constraints on the underlying process ( think how poses of the human body are constrained by the range of motion of the joints ) or on the representation in the ambient space ( e.g. , pixels can not have negative intensity ) .",
    "in this paper we provide an analysis of these three cases for laplacian - based learning algorithms .",
    "it turns out that all of these singularities result in a behavior near the singularity markedly different from that inside the manifold , a phenomenon somewhat reminiscent of the gibbs effect in fourier analysis . in particular , the scaling of the operator is different near singularities . as a result of this scaling behavior",
    ", singularities can not be ignored , even globally , despite the fact that relatively few points are located near them , since each of these points contributes disproportionately to the total operator .",
    "we also find that at a finer level of analysis these singularities have quite different effects , which are discussed below .",
    "we believe that a comprehensive understanding of these structures in addition to the standard case of a smooth manifold can take us a long way toward better methods for analysis of complex non - linear data and can lead to significant progress in algorithm design",
    ".     * related work .",
    "* methods based on graph laplacians constructed from data have gained acceptance for a range of inference tasks including clustering  @xcite , semi - supervised learning ( e.g.  @xcite ) and dimensionality reduction  @xcite , as well as others .",
    "an analysis in  @xcite provided a mathematical framework for many of these methods by connecting graph laplacian constructed from data to the laplace - beltrami operator of the underlying manifold based on the relation of the laplacian and the heat equation . that analysis was extended and generalized in  @xcite providing a detailed understanding of graph laplacians obtained from manifold data . while boundary effects have been studied in non - parametric kernel smoothing ( see , e.g. ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4.4 ) ) , they have not been considered in the laplacian - related literature , although we note that boundary behavior for the infinite data case can be derived from the taylor series expansion in lemma  9 of  @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , other singularities are not considered in that literature .",
    "( in fact , the reason causing the different scaling behavior for intersection and edge types of singularities is somewhat different from that for the boundary case . )    in related developments , a considerable amount of recent work has been aimed at understanding the case of intersecting linear spaces using various techniques from algebraic geometry to spectral clustering ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) both in terms of algorithms and theoretical guarantees . in our setting",
    ", this is a special case of a singular manifold with intersection singularities .",
    "another related work is  @xcite , where the authors analyze a model based on a mixture of manifolds in the context of semi - supervised learning .",
    "we also note that there has been much recent interest in reconstructing topological invariants of manifolds and other spaces ( see , e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "the line of work most related to our results is on learning stratified spaces , where multiple submanifolds ( strata ) are `` glued '' nicely together  @xcite , which provides an even more general model for a singular space .",
    "* summary of results . * consider the ( appropriately scaled , see section  2 ) graph laplacian @xmath0 constructed from @xmath1 data points , using the gaussian kernel with bandwidth @xmath2 .",
    "it can be shown ( see the references above ) that as @xmath2 tends to zero and @xmath1 tends to infinity at an appropriate rate , @xmath0 converges to the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath3 ( a second order differential operator ) inside the manifold . in this paper",
    ", we show that for singular manifolds @xmath0 exhibits a very different behavior near the singularity set . specifically , for a sufficiently smooth function @xmath4 and a small @xmath2 , within distance @xmath5 of the singularity set , @xmath6 is approximated by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is some first order derivative operator that will be described explicitly .",
    "the difference in scaling becomes crucial when @xmath2 is small as the @xmath9 term becomes dominant . to simplify the discussion",
    ", we will first assume that the data is infinite , and thus @xmath6 can be replaced by @xmath10 .",
    "finite sample bounds and rates will be discussed later .",
    "the types of singularities considered in the paper are as follows :    * boundary . * at a point @xmath11 near manifold boundary , @xmath12 can be approximated by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the distance from @xmath11 to the boundary and @xmath15 is the unit vector toward the nearest boundary point ( outward normal at the boundary ) .",
    "@xmath16 denotes the directional derivative , while @xmath17 is a scalar function of the form @xmath18 . + * intersection and edge .",
    "* the situation is more complicated for other types of singularities , where two different manifolds @xmath19 and @xmath20 intersect or come together . given a point @xmath21 consider its projection @xmath22 onto @xmath20 and its nearest neighbor @xmath23 in the singularity .",
    "similarly to the boundary case , let @xmath24 and @xmath25 , be the directions to @xmath23 from @xmath26 and @xmath22 respectively and let @xmath27 and @xmath28 be the corresponding distances .",
    "@xmath29 can be approximated by @xmath30 .",
    "importantly , the form of the scalar functions @xmath31 is different for different types of singularities : for intersection - type singularity , we have : @xmath32 , while for edge - type we have s for edge singularities by removing some higher order terms ( see section  3.3 ) . ] : @xmath33 . here the coefficients @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 depend on the angle between the manifolds and can be written explicitly .    *",
    "significant points and observations : *    * 1 . scaling . * within @xmath37 distance of the singularity",
    ", @xmath12 is dominated by a differential operator different from the laplace - beltrami operator . away from the singularity ,",
    "the higher - valued ( @xmath38 ) term fades and @xmath12 becomes an approximation to the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath3 .    * 2 .",
    "contributions of singular points .",
    "* let the dimension of the manifold be @xmath39 .",
    "the volume of points within @xmath5 of the singularity is approximately @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the @xmath42 dimensional volume of the singular points is always @xmath42 dimensional ( co - dimension one ) , for the boundary and `` edge '' singularities ( although not necessarily for the intersection ) . ] .",
    "fix a function @xmath4 . as @xmath43 , the integral @xmath10 over the points within @xmath5 of the singularity does not disappear and , in fact , will converge to a constant , depending on the function and the @xmath42 dimensional volume of the singularity @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , because of the scaling , the contribution of those near - singular points to the @xmath44 norm will tend to infinity .",
    "we remark that , while different from a technical point of view , this phenomenon is reminiscent to the gibbs effect in fourier series , where the effects of discontinuity do not vanish as approximation becomes more precise .    *",
    "shape near the boundary .",
    "* while the @xmath45 scaling is common for all singularities , the type of singularity is reflected in the shape of the function @xmath46 , which is very different for different types of singularities .",
    "somewhat over - simplifying matters , one can think of @xmath47 for the boundary case , @xmath48 for the intersection singularity and @xmath49 for the edge ( see figures above ) .",
    "these differences lead to quite distinctive patterns , when the operator is applied to a fixed function .",
    "for example , the directional derivative terms disappear _ at _ the intersection - type singular points .",
    "in fact for these points @xmath50 converges to the usual laplace - beltrami operator .",
    "however , at points within @xmath5 distance of these points we expect to see @xmath51 take both positive and negative values of magnitude @xmath5 .",
    "we think that this difference may be a key to future algorithms .",
    "* 4 . rates and finite sample bounds . *",
    "convergence rates for @xmath2 as well as finite sample bounds are provided in section  [ sec : convergencerate ] .",
    "interestingly , and perhaps counter - intuitively , the scaling implies that fewer data points are required to ensure that @xmath52 is an accurate ( relative ) estimate of @xmath53 near the boundary than inside the domain .    *",
    "5 . impact on eigenfunctions*. eigenfunctions of the graph laplacian associated to data are used in a large number of applications . while the question of convergence is very subtle ( see @xcite for the proof in the case of a smooth manifold ) ,",
    "our results for fixed functions provide an indication of the expected answer assuming the convergence holds .",
    "we provide a brief discussion of it in section [ sec : implication ] .",
    "it turns out that the boundary case automatically leads to neumann boundary conditions ( even though the operator does not `` see '' the boundary explicitly ) .",
    "quite surprisingly , the edge singularity appears to have no effect on the limit behavior of eigenfunctions , at least if the singular manifold is isometric to a smooth one ( think of bending a sheet of paper ) .",
    "the case of the intersection is more complex , but intersections of co - dimension two or more seem to have no effect on the limit behavior of eigenfunctions ( in @xmath44 norm ) .    *",
    "6 . normalized laplacians",
    ". multiple manifolds .",
    "* while we do not provide a detailed discussion due to space constraints , our analysis can be fairly straightforwardly generalized to other versions of graph laplacians , including the random walk normalized , symmetric normalized , and twice normalized graph laplacian discussed in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the popular symmetric normalized laplacian does not lead to neumann boundary conditions as a density term appears inside the directional derivative , i.e. , @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "the resulting expression involves derivatives of the density and does not appear to be a natural boundary condition .",
    "the analysis can also be extended to the case of multiple manifolds .",
    "we restrict our discussion to the case of two manifolds to simplify the exposition .",
    "finally , some experimental results can be found in appendix [ appendix : sec : exp ] .",
