    "the angular - momentum - projection method is a fully microscopic means to recover the rotational invariance , which is broken in the selfconsistently determined nuclear mean - field , e.g. , by the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculation .",
    "although nice rotational spectrum is obtained by the projection from one intrinsic mean - field , it often happens that the moment of inertia is smaller in comparison with the experimental data as long as the projection is performed from the time - reversal invariant mean - field state .",
    "inclusion of the time - odd components is important for realistic description of nuclear rotational motion , and one of the efficient ways to realize it is the so - called cranking procedure , which is justified by the variational point of view  @xcite .",
    "recently we have shown  @xcite that indeed the calculated moment of inertia is considerably increased if the projection is performed from the cranked mean - field state with very small cranking frequency . moreover",
    ", the resultant spectrum is independent of actual values of the frequency if it is small enough  @xcite : we call this procedure as `` infinitesimal cranking '' . in our previous studies the selfconsistent mean - field state",
    "before the cranking is either axially symmetric  @xcite or tetrahedrally - symmetric  @xcite , so that the direction of cranking axis does not matter ; there is only one rotational axis for the quantum mechanical axially symmetric system , and the tetrahedral deformation is `` spherical '' in the sense that all rotational axes are equivalent , which is also confirmed numerically  @xcite . in the present work we consider the case of the triaxial deformation , where one can crank the mean - field state around three independent rotational axes .",
    "we study the effects of infinitesimal cranking around three principal axes on the spectrum of triaxially deformed nucleus obtained by the angular - momentum - projection method .",
    "the second purpose of the present investigation is the description of the gamma vibration by the angular - momentum - projection method .",
    "the motivation emerged from the precedent analysis by the so - called triaxial projected shell model approach  @xcite : it is concluded that rather large triaxial deformation of the mean - field is necessary to reproduce the very low - lying nature of the gamma vibration , see also refs .",
    "@xcite for studies with the axial projected shell model .",
    "the gamma vibration is the most well recognized collective vibration in atomic nuclei  @xcite . in the rare earth region",
    "the ground state is believed to be axially deformed according to the mean - field calculations by , e.g. , the strutinsky shell correction method and/or the skyrme hfb method , and the gamma vibration is interpreted as a surface vibration that dynamically breaks the axial symmetry .",
    "in fact the gamma vibration has been studied by the random phase approximation ( rpa ) calculation with the schematic @xmath4 type interaction based on the axially symmetric vacuum state  @xcite , although the strong anharmonicity for two - phonon states exists ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "however , there is a long history on the interpretation of the gamma vibration ; by employing the asymmetric ( triaxial ) rotor model  @xcite it was discussed in the early days that its low - lying nature indicates the considerable triaxial deformation , although it is very difficult to draw a definite conclusion from the existing experimental data .",
    "therefore the analysis by the triaxial projected shell model  @xcite revived the old problem ; whether the nucleus in the rare earth region is axially symmetric or triaxially deformed .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that in the triaxially deformed case the high - spin part of the multiple rotational bands based on the excitations of the gamma vibration is interpreted as the wobbling - phonon bands  @xcite .",
    "we briefly discuss also this interesting issue of the relation between the multiple gamma bands and the wobbling band .    as for the proper treatment of the triaxial degree of freedom",
    ", we use the configuration - mixing , or the generator coordinate method ( gcm )  @xcite , on top of the angular - momentum - projection .",
    "one of the great merits of this microscopic approach is that not only the energy spectrum but also the transition probability can be calculated full quantum mechanically without any ambiguity .",
    "it is known that the @xmath5 transition probability between the ground state and the gamma vibrational state is overestimated in the rpa approach with schematic interaction by a factor @xmath6 in the rare earth region , if the nilsson potential is used as a mean - field  @xcite ; the situation is improved if the woods - saxon potential is used instead but the @xmath7 is still overestimated by a factor @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that this problem is greatly improved in our angular - momentum - projected configuration - mixing approach .",
    "we employ the gogny d1s force  @xcite as an effective interaction , and select the nucleus @xmath0er as a typical example of rare earth nuclei .",
