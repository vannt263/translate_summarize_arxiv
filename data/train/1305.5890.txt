    "in the case where the electrostatic coupling is symmetric with respect to the two electrode polarities , the force on a segment of membrane floating above the electrodes can be described by @xmath39 with the area of the segment @xmath10 , distance between fixed electrodes and membrane @xmath5 , dc voltage @xmath11 between fixed electrodes , and an electrostatic force constant @xmath12 ; @xmath13 is a scaling function with units of inverse area .    in writing the force law ( [ eq : forcesi ] ) we have assumed the membrane dynamics to take place under fixed voltage conditions .",
    "this requires the voltage source to supply and absorb charge at the timescale on which the membrane motion modulates the capacitance .",
    "however , even if we operate in the opposite limit , i.e. fixed charge on the capacitor , the appropriate correction to the force law ( [ eq : forcesi ] ) is negligible for our setup @xcite ; this is due to stray capacitance ( in the cables from the voltage source ) that is much larger than that of the electrode - membrane arrangement .",
    "intuitively , the large stray capacitance acts as a charge reservoir for the modulated electrode - membrane capacitor , effectively keeping the electrode voltage constant .",
    "the equilibrium of forces for an infinitesimal piece of membrane with the area @xmath40 and thickness @xmath18 is @xmath41 with the displacement function @xmath42 , the tensile pre - stress @xmath43 , and the mass density @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath44 is a heaviside step function ( or a product of such functions ) taking into account electrode gaps and edges , as well as the hole in the membrane metallization of some of the membranes used .",
    "the deflection of a membrane can be described by @xmath45 with the mode shape function @xmath46    considering the first order taylor approximation of the electrostatic force ( [ eq : forcesi ] ) , the equation of motion can be written as @xmath47 in a  linear system  , the static force term @xmath48 causes a static deflection of the membrane .",
    "this static deflection does not influence the eigenfrequency and can thus be neglected . following galerkin s method , ( [ eq : equationofmotion ] ) can be solved for the fundamental normal mode by multiplying it with @xmath49 and integrating over the entire membrane area @xmath50 with @xmath51 @xmath52 which with ( [ eq : drum_mode_expansion ] ) can be written as @xmath53 where we have ignored the induced couplings to other membrane modes assumed to be weak .",
    "the frequency can now be isolated from ( [ eq : galerkin ] ) @xmath54 with the eigenfrequency @xmath55 of a membrane with zero voltage applied ( @xmath56 ) @xmath57 and introducing the overlap factor @xmath58 between the membrane mode @xmath49 and the electrode mask @xmath59 the first order taylor approximation of @xmath60 becomes @xmath61 which results in a relative frequency shift of @xmath62 for a membrane with a continuous electrode ( @xmath63 ) the frequency shift due to the electrostatic spring softening effect becomes @xmath64    in our experiments , the electrostatic force factor @xmath12 was determined by measuring the relative frequency shift of a membrane as a function of @xmath11 .",

    "the potential of the floating conductive membrane is @xmath71 , given that it is placed symmetrically in relation to the two electrode polarities .",
    "thus , the force on a conductive membrane segment of area @xmath10 to coplanar quarter - segment electrodes is @xmath72 and therewith the force constant ( [ eq : forcesi ] ) becomes @xmath73 using the scaling function @xmath74 .      in our experiments with sin - g membranes on quarter - segment electrodes ,",
    "it is possible that we may have additional capacitance contributions from the excess graphene outside the membrane area ( as opposed to the case of sin - al membranes where the al layer is strictly confined to within the sin membrane area ) .",
    "specifically , such extra contributions may occur in a highly asymmetric manner with regard to the two electrode polarities .",
    "this prompts us to derive the theoretical value of @xmath12 for the case of highly asymmetric capacitance between the conductive membrane and the two electrode polarities . in this case",
    "the membrane will be essentially equipotential with one of the electrode polarities whereby the electrostatic force vanishes on membrane segments above electrodes of this polarity .",
    "hence , under these circumstances , the membrane coupling to the electrodes is extremely asymmetric wrt .  the two polarities and @xmath12 acquires a dependence on position in the membrane plane : the force constant vanishes for the part of the membrane above electrodes with which it is equipotential , while for membrane segments above the other polarity , with which the potential difference is @xmath11 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : force_parallel ] ) leads to @xmath75 which is four times the symmetrical value , eq .",
    "( [ eq : c_sym_theory ] ) .",
    "we will now discuss how the above effect , if present in our setup , would affect the force constants extracted from experiment . in the simple case where the membrane _ mode _ is symmetric wrt .  the two electrode polarities ( while the electrostatic force is not ) , the experimental force constant , as calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : c_exp_eta11 ] ) , samples the effective and ineffective electrodes equally , resulting in @xmath76 ( given that the perfect conductor model is valid for sin - g ) .",

    "in fact , by means of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta_general_4seg ] ) presented below , we find that the addition of a large , asymmetrical capacitance wrt .",
    "one polarity can enhance the fundamental mode frequency shift by a factor of @xmath77 for alignments within the cited range . by assuming a flat distribution within this range , we find that the effect would enhance the averaged force constant by a factor of 2.1 . a related mechanism",
    ", that would result in exactly the same enhancement as just described , is involuntary charging of the membrane by short - circuiting with one of the electrode polarities with @xmath78 time much less than the membrane oscillation period @xmath79 .    on the other hand ,",
    "consider a similar short - circuiting but with @xmath78 time longer than the membrane period while still much less than the scan time for the dc voltage @xmath11 .",
    "in this situation the dynamics take place with fixed charge on the membrane and without access to the charge reservoir of the large stray capacitance as the latter now acts in series with the much smaller membrane - electrode capacitance ( compare to the situation described in section [ sec : force_constant ] ) .",
    "we find that the fundamental mode frequency shift can be modified by a factor of @xmath80 within the alignment range stated earlier . assuming a flat alignment distribution once again , we find that the averaged force constant would be enhanced by a factor of 1.4 in case of such membrane charging",
    ".    regarding sin - g on quarter - segment electrodes , either of the above effects could serve to explain , at least partially , the large error bars of the average force constant ( presented in fig .",
    "3c of the main text ) .",
    "moreover , the effects of strongly asymmetrical capacitance and charging with short @xmath78 time enhance the frequency shift in a way that is compatible with the average experimental force constant lying above the theoretical value for symmetrical coupling by a factor of 2.7 .",
    "we discussed in section [ sec : theory_c_4seg ] the two limits of coupling a conductive membrane to quarter - segment electrodes : symmetric and strongly asymmetric . in calculating the experimental force constants presented in the main text for the quarter - segment geometry , we assume that the capacitance between the electrodes and the conductive layer on the membrane only has contributions from the membrane area ( however , see remarks regarding excess graphene in section [ sec : theory_c_4seg_asym ] ) . to be able to account for electrode mask asymmetry and misalignment ,",
    "we model the coupling as two capacitors in series : the capacitance between the positive electrode segments with the membrane in series with that between the negative electrodes and the membrane ( note that @xmath5 is much smaller than the gap between fixed electrodes ) .",
    "this leads to the following generalization of the overlap factor @xmath20 , eq .",

    "( [ eq : eta_general_4seg ] ) can be interpreted as follows : the first ( second ) term represents the frequency shift contribution from the membrane area above positive ( negative ) electrodes with the local potential difference fixed at its equilibrium value , whereas the third term is a correction due to the modulations of the membrane potential around the equilibrium value .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta_general_4seg ] ) in calculating experimental @xmath12 values in order to account for gaps , edges and a slight asymmetry in the electrode mask as well as the central hole in the al layer of the sin - al membranes .",

    "in the case of charging , a linear force adds up to the quadratic electrostatic force .",
    "thus , a linear term has to be added to the relative frequency shift as a function of dc voltage ( [ eq : softening ] ) @xmath87 fig .",

    "<S> the grey lines represent a linear fit in a ) and a quadratic fit in b).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we performed further characterization of the sin - g membranes by studying the dependence of the ac amplitude and the dc displacement on the coupling voltage ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sin - g ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the ac driving voltage is small compared to the dc bias voltage , the electrostatic force becomes @xmath38 thus the mechanical resonance peak amplitude is approximately a linear function of the dc voltage , for a fixed ac driving voltage , and the static deflection of the membrane is a quadratic function of the dc voltage . as seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sin - g ] the experimentally observed behavior supports the model .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we have shown that sin - g membranes with a single layer of graphene are promising canditates for efficient optoelectromechanical hybrid coupling devices . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by using the graphene sheet on sin in a floating electrode configuration , we overcome the unsolved problem of high contact resistance between metal electrodes and graphene . </S>",
    "<S> they show electromechanical coupling which is as good as for an ideal conductor . </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced electromechanical coupling of conductive membranes lowers the threshold for strong coupling , as predicted for dielectric membranes @xcite , accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> the single graphene layer is mechanically invisible and does not negatively influence the membrane performance . unlike the real metal coating , graphene does not require patterning in order to maintain the highest mechanical quality factors of a bare sin membrane . also , unlike the metal coating , graphene does not add any noticeable mass to the membrane which is an advantage for high sensitivity applications , such as , e.g. , the optical detection of radio waves with metallized silicon nitride membrane resonators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lower mass achieved by sin - g membranes as compared to sin - al membranes used in the reference would improve the quantum efficiency of rf - to - optical conversion by up to 4 times ( by the ratio of the masses ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the use of graphene overcomes the complications of charging effects in sin membranes , which has shown to be difficult to control .    </S>",
