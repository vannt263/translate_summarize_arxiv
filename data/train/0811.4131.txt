    "chemical reactions limited by the motions of the reactants are abundant in nature , and among the most thoroughly studied are diffusion - limited reactions .",
    "a ubiquitous approach to these systems simply adds the diffusion and reaction contributions together so as to construct appropriate reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "it is implicit and even explicit in these approaches that the diffusive component describes a motion without a memory , and if one invokes an underlying continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) where walkers react when they meet , it is understood that the waiting time distributions for reactants to remain at one location before moving on have a finite mean .",
    "the most frequently invoked waiting time in this scenario is exponential .",
    "it is also understood that in fact many microscopic models can be subsumed under the same mesoscopic reaction - diffusion umbrella  @xcite .    on the other hand , contrary to the diffusive case , it is by now fairly clear that different microscopic scenarios of reactions among subdiffusive species , even simple scenarios , lead to different mesoscopic descriptions  @xcite .",
    "for instance , a popular mesoscopic vehicle , the ctrw , involves waiting time distributions of ensembles of particles undergoing reactions .",
    "the forms of these distributions depend on the underlying microscopic rules and may vary from one microscopic scenario to another .",
    "it is thus risky to simply assume a form for these distributions as one would for diffusive particles . instead",
    ", a more detailed derivation starting from a set of microscopic rules to arrive at a mesoscopic ctrw description is necessary .",
    "the specific microscopic reaction scenario of interest to us is a lattice whose sites are occupied by traps of varying depths , that is , the quenched trap scenario .",
    "if independent particles simply walk on this lattice , their escape time from each trap is exponentially distributed , with the distribution of trap depths reflected in a distribution of mean escape times .",
    "an average over this distribution leads to a ctrw model in which all sites have the same waiting time distribution  @xcite .",
    "this latter process is spatially homogeneous and semi - markovian , and anomalous diffusion arises if the resulting mean waiting time on each site diverges .",
    "this is the so - called annealed trap scenario .",
    "however , if particles can also react with one another , interesting questions immediately arise . of interest to us are the reactions @xmath2 ( coagulation ) and @xmath3 ( annihilation ) ; some uncertainties arising from different microscopic descriptions can be illustrated with the coagulation reaction .",
    "suppose there is an @xmath4 at a site , and a second @xmath4 arrives . in the underlying spatially",
    "disordered quenched trap model , it does not matter which particle is  killed \" by the reaction since the waiting time distribution for particle departure from any site is exponential .",
    "such a process is often called memoryless because the future of each particle is determined only by its present state and not its past , and therefore the differences between the two victims become irrelevant .",
    "however if , as we subsequently do , we implement a mean field assumption which turns out to lead to a description that is asymptotically equivalent to a ctrw with diverging mean waiting times , that is , to an annealed trap model , it may make a kinetic difference which of the two particles is  killed \" in each reaction .",
    "it is not clear in general how to include such fine distinctions in a mesoscopic formalism , nor is it clear what sort of rule at the mesoscopic or mean field level best mimics the behavior of the underlying trapping problem .    our mean field model shares with other ctrw models with diverging mean waiting times the phenomenon of  aging \"  @xcite .",
    "even in non - reactive systems , aging causes the waiting time distribution itself to change with time as particles settle into sites with ever longer waiting times ( corresponding to particles caught in ever deeper traps in the underlying system ) .",
    "aging for non - reactive particles does not occur in a given finite quenched trap environment since the distribution of particles approaches a boltzmann distribution  @xcite .",
    "the most intriguing unanswered question that we address in this work is whether the reactions cause a change in the waiting time distribution .",
    "we anticipate our answer to this latter question : we find that in our mean field model the reaction does _ not _ cause an additional change in the waiting time distribution",
    ".    we will compare our model predictions with the results of numerical simulations of the actual distributed trap scenario .",
    "we find that the mean field approach works well for higher dimensions ( @xmath5 ) but not for low dimensions ( @xmath6 ) , a result that agrees with the well - known differences in subdiffusion exponents predicted by ctrw theories and those obtained by numerical simulations in the absence of reactions  @xcite the concentrations of surviving particles are known to be well reproduced in all dimensions by invoking relations with the number of distinct sites visited in the asymptotically equivalent ctrw  @xcite . on the other hand , the mean field formalism , while restricted to higher dimensions , provides additional direct insights into the more detailed information contained in the time dependence of the waiting time distributions .    in sec .",
    "[ ctrwmodel ] we describe our mean field model and arrive at a master equation for the density of particles with given mean rate for leaving any site in the absence of reactions .",
    "this equation explicitly shows the effects of aging . in sec .",
    "[ withreaction ] we establish the corresponding master equations in the presence of the coagulation and annihilation reactions . in sec .",
    "[ solution ] we discuss the solution of the master equation for the time - dependent rate distribution .",
    "comparisons with numerical simulation results for the underlying random trap model are presented in sec .",
    "[ numerical ] .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "to construct a mean field model , we start with a lattice whose sites are traps of varying depths .",
    "our model is equivalent to that of  @xcite , but our notation is suitably modified to facilitate the inclusion of reactions , which they do not consider .",
    "the waiting time for leaving a trap @xmath7 is exponentially distributed , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , the mean sojourn time in the trap , is determined by the trap s depth via the kramers ( arrhenius ) law .",
    "we further assume that the distribution of mean waiting times is a power law , for example , @xmath10 .",
    "note that the asymptotics of the pdf @xmath11 of waiting times @xmath12 upon averaging over this distribution of mean waiting times is then of power law form even though the waiting time for each trap is exponentially distributed , i.e. , @xmath13    the power law distribution of mean waiting times @xmath9 leads to a power law distribution of the  leaving rates \" @xmath14 for departing from a site , @xmath15 note that all the moments of the distribution of the rates are finite even if those of the waiting time distribution are not .",
    "particles are distributed over sites with different mean waiting times , and as time proceeds , the distribution of particles over these sites changes even in the absence of reactions because more and more particles get stuck in deeper and deeper traps .",
    "our central question concerns the effects of reactions on this evolving distribution . in particular , we ask whether the distribution is modified by the reactions . this is difficult to answer , at least analytically , without further approximation .",
    "the system with distributed traps of varying depths is spatially inhomogeneous , and if the particle executes the usual nearest neighbor random walk , the future of any particle moving over this landscape may be strongly dependent on its particular location .",
    "furthermore , there may be strong correlations among subsequent steps ( especially in lower dimensions ) because the particle may revisit a previously visited site . to make progress we implement a mean field approximation designed to provide information about the evolving distribution of particles over the inhomogeneous landscape .",
    "specifically , we assume that the particles do not perform a nearest neighbor random walk but instead that each particle is equally likely ( probability @xmath16 ) to step on any of the @xmath17 sites of the system .",
    "in other words , the lattice is a complete graph .",
    "equivalently , as an alternative way of viewing the model , we can think of particles performing nearest neighbor random walks , but before each step the mean waiting time associated with the trap to which the particle is about to step is chosen anew from the distribution @xmath18 or , correspondingly , a new leaving rate is chosen from @xmath19 , independently of the waiting times chosen in prior steps .",
    "it is also equivalent to a nearest neighbor ctrw in a very high - dimensional quenched medium . in any case ,",
    "in the absence of reactions this results in a space - homogeneous ctrw model with waiting time distribution @xmath11 as given in eq .",
    "( [ psit ] ) chosen anew at each step .    the assumptions underlying the mean field approach",
    "are expected to be more adequate for random walks that are transient , that is , ones in which already visited sites are revisited only with a small probability so that almost all sites reached by the walker are new sites .",
    "this is the case for random walks in dimensions @xmath5 and , as we show in sec .",
    "[ numerical ] , we do find excellent agreement between the mean field approach and numerical simulations for the reactions in quenched trap environments for @xmath5 .",
    "if the walk is recurrent , that is , if the same sites are revisited repeatedly , the approximation may be poor .",
    "one - dimensional walks are recurrent , and @xmath20 is the marginal dimension for this property .    as noted earlier , as time evolves the distribution of particles over the sites with given mean waiting times ( leaving rates ) changes even in the absence of the reactions because more and more particles get stuck in deeper and deeper traps .",
    "we discuss these changes first in the absence and then in the presence of the reactions . for this purpose",
    "we note that under the mean field assumption , the master equation for the probability @xmath21 to be at site @xmath7 at time @xmath12 reads @xmath22 since each site is characterized by its own @xmath23 , we can pass from the occupation probability @xmath24 to the probability @xmath25 and introduce the density @xmath26 of particles occupying sites with leaving rate between @xmath23 and @xmath27 .",
    "one easily deduces that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the number of sites with leaving rates between @xmath23 and @xmath30 .",
    "note that in a large system @xmath31 the last integral can be associated with the time - dependent mean rate , @xmath32 multiplying both sides of eq .",
    "( [ me1 ] ) by @xmath19 leads to the master equation for @xmath26 , @xmath33 this equation governs the change in the distribution of particles over jump rates in the absence of reactions .",
    "note that the total concentration of particles @xmath34 is constant in time .",
    "next we explore the effects of reactions on the site occupation probabilities .",
    "we assume that the usual law of mass action is appropriate at the _ local _ level .",
    "for the case of the @xmath35 reaction within our mean - field approximation , the change in the occupation probability at site @xmath7 is @xmath36\\frac{1}{n } \\sum_{j \\neq i } \\omega_j a_j(t ) -",

    "gives the classical kinetic equations @xmath50 with the stoichiometric coefficient ( `` molarity '' ) of the reaction @xmath51 for the @xmath35 reaction and @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "the mean jump rate @xmath54 is thus the time - dependent reaction rate .    the equation for the probability density @xmath55 corresponding to eqs .",
    "( [ re1_2 ] ) and ( [ re2_2 ] ) is then @xmath56 with eq .",
    "( [ formk ] ) we see that the term with the time derivative @xmath57 on the left side of this equation and the last term on the right side cancel .",
    "thus , the final equation for @xmath58 does not depend on the molarity @xmath59 of the reaction and is the same as the equation for @xmath26 in the absence of reactions , @xmath60 this statement also leads to the remarkable conclusion that within the mean field approximation adopted in this model _ the reaction does not affect the waiting time distribution_. this answers one of our main questions .",
    "the principal question posed earlier , namely , whether the reaction changes the waiting time distribution , has been answered in the negative within our mean - field approach .",
    "it is now instructive to obtain an explicit expression for the time dependent reaction rate .",

    "( [ tdrate ] ) depends on @xmath58 itself .",

    "we can rewrite @xmath74 as @xmath75 for any @xmath76 .",
    "relevant to the long - time asymptotic behavior is the small-@xmath77 behavior of @xmath74 .",

    "we can connect this quantity to the average reaction rate @xmath54 for @xmath97 as follows .",
    "since at each step of the process a particle mostly visits a new site in the system ( the random walk is  transient \" or  non - recurrent \" ) , the reaction rate can be approximated by the time derivative of the number of newly visited sites , @xmath98 , and we have @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the probability of return to the origin ( @xmath101 for a simple cubic lattice ) .",

    "although the interpretation of the reaction rate in terms of the number of distinct sites visited is quite standard , the fact that the broad distribution of trapping times does not introduce any additional fluctuation effects into the kinetics is not at all trivial .    a further connection with the distinct number of sites visited in a ctrw occurs for the concentration of surviving reactant , namely , @xmath106 , a connection that holds not only for @xmath107 but also for @xmath108 , i.e. , even when the random walk is recurrent  @xcite . in @xcite",

    "our discussion supports the expectation that the results of the mean field model approximate those of the underlying random depth trap system in @xmath109 ( but not in @xmath113 ) . even in @xmath109 , where walks are transient , it is nevertheless the case that there is a finite probability @xmath100 of return to a previously visited site , e.g. about 1/3 for a simple cubic lattice . in this section",
    "we compare our results with those of numerical simulations of @xmath109 and @xmath113 lattices with traps of random mean exit times as described earlier . the algorithm used in the simulations",
    "is described in some detail in the appendix .",

    "the coincidence of the simulation results for the two cases shows that this is indeed the case .",

    "the results for the two sizes are the same except for the larger value of @xmath124 , where we see some deviations from the straight line at very long times due to finite size effects .",
    "these deviations are more pronounced for the larger @xmath124 ( in the faster walk the ends of the lattices are reached earlier ) and for the smaller lattice .",
    "since this is a log - log plot the straight - line behavior confirms the power law decay of the concentrations .",
    "furthermore , we find that the slopes of these lines are close to @xmath124 .",
    "in particular , we find slopes @xmath125 for @xmath114 and @xmath126 for @xmath115 ( in both cases for both reactions ) .",

    "we do not know whether this indicates that here again the reactions do not affect the dynamics of the moving species , but this result indicates that it may be so .",
    "second , we note that the exponents of the concentration , while quite different from those of the mean field model , agree with those associated with the distinct number of sites visited for the original trap model , namely , that in one dimension @xmath129 because all sites within the span of the random walk are visited at least once .",

    "we calculate reactant concentrations as a function of time as well as the time - dependent distribution of particles over sites with different escape rates .",
    "the mean field model is designed with the particular goal of studying this evolving distribution and the effects of the reactions on it , and is expected to do well in dimensions @xmath5 but not in @xmath113 .",
    "the noteworthy outcome of the model is that this distribution is _ not changed _ by the occurrence of the reactions .",
    "one consequence of this result is that the concentration of surviving reactant in the @xmath0 reaction is double that of the @xmath147 reactions , that is , @xmath128 .",
    "while the model does not shed light on the @xmath113 case , numerical simulations here also show that @xmath128 and thus a reaction - insensitive aging distribution of particles is not ruled out .",
    "numerical simulations in @xmath148 with quenched traps agree with these predictions .",
    "while the waiting time distribution is unaffected by the reaction in this mean field model , it is interesting to speculate about the assumptions that would have to be made in a _ spatially translationally invariant model with long - tailed waiting time distributions _ to arrive at this conclusion in a formulation that includes an explicit description of the reaction ( we remind the reader that this is not an issue in the underlying random trap depth model with exponentially distributed waiting times ) .",
    "the result would seem to be automatically correct for the @xmath53 reaction since every reacting pair involves two particles that have not been previously involved in a reaction .",
    "however , for the @xmath149 reaction the situation is different .",
    "here one of the reaction partners continues its walk and may participate in a later reaction .",
    "it may make a difference whether the survivor is the @xmath4 that arrived at the site immediately before the reaction (  no kill \" scenario ) , or the @xmath4 that was there already (  kill \" scenario ) , or a choice of one or the other according to some probability . while it might be tempting to assume that a random choice of one or the other ( e.g. with equal probability ) would lead to the mean field result obtained above , it is not immediately evident that this choice provides exactly the correct compensatory effect .",
