    "this is the basic physical idea underlying goodenough s conjecture for the ce - type afm ordering.@xcite the picture had no solid justification and for many years remained to be on the level of a hypothesis .",
    "only very recently it was realized by several authors that , at least at very low temperatures , the basic proporties of the  charge ordered  manganites can be understood exclusively from the viewpoint of the de physics.@xcite due to the strong hund s rule coupling , the mn ions form a high - spin state in manganites .",

    "two nonbonding bands are composed of the @xmath5 states of the corner ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) atoms and the @xmath154@xmath32@xmath153 ( @xmath152@xmath32@xmath153 ) states of the bridge @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) atoms . even without the jtd , the system is insulating and the band gap is 0.3 ev .",
    "this value is however smaller than the estimate @xmath310 ev expected from the tight - bonding analysis ( the value of effective two - center @xmath49 integral ) .",
    "the difference is caused by the additional broadening of the bonding and nonbonding bands in the lsda .",
    "the jtd increases the band - gap ( for example , for @xmath250@xmath12@xmath335 the band - gap is @xmath310 ev ) .",
    "second , the partial densities of states in the bonding part of the spectrum clearly shows the characteristic peaks at the band edges , which is the signature of ( quasi- ) one - dimensional behavior .",
    "the bandwidth is however larger than @xmath336@xmath32@xmath337@xmath1@xmath310@xmath133@xmath13 ev , expected from the tb analysis .",

    "the minority - spin @xmath26 states may interact with the majority - spin @xmath5 states of the neighboring zigzag chains either directly , via next nearest - neighbor hoppings ( note , that the nearest - neighbor hoppings between the @xmath26 and @xmath5 orbitals are forbidden in the cubic lattice  ref . ) , or indirectly , via the oxygen @xmath242 band . as the result , the  nonbonding ",
    "states associated with the corner atoms @xmath29 and @xmath30 are significantly broadened ( to be compared with the @xmath250-peak expected from the tb analysis - fig .",

    "some details of calculations can be found in refs . .",
    "here we only would like to mention that in order to speed up rather heavy calculations ( note that taking into consideration the zigzag afm ordering , the unit cell of y@xmath14sr@xmath15mno@xmath16 consists of 56 atoms ) , the brillouin zone integration in the calculations of optical conductivity was replaced by a summation with the phenomenological lorentzian broadening of @xmath338 ev .",
    "this causes some artificial broadening of the spectrum . nevertheless , we believe that all important features are preserved in it , and were not washed out by the broadening . as the test , one can consider the off - diagonal element @xmath339 in the low - energy part of the spectrum .",

    "surprisingly however that the shape of diagonal conductivity in the @xmath342-plane is very different , contrary to our expectations based on the tb model . in the low - energy part of the spectrum it has only one large peak at @xmath310 ev . the difference can not be simply attributed to the broadening effects , because otherwise similar broadening would be expected also for the off - diagonal component of the conductivity tensor .",
    "unfortunately , on the level of first - principles band structure calculations , it is rather difficult to decompose the optical conductivity unambiguously into partial contributions and to elucidate the origin of the spectral shape .",
    "most probably , the difference between the lsda calculations and the tb analysis is caused at once by several factors outlined in the beginning of this section .    in the tb model , two contributions to the conductivity spectrum in the region of bonding - nonbonding transitions , @xmath318 and @xmath343 , are comparable ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.opt.tb ] ) . the off - diagonal element of the conductivity tensor , which is responsible for the anisotropy of optical properties , is related with the diagonal one by eq .",

    "for example , in the lsda we have only @xmath345@xmath346@xmath347 in the region of bonding - nonbonding transitions .",
    "the jtd around the bridge sites results in the upward shift of the low - energy peak and the simultaneous decrease of its intensity .",

    "however , the obtained intensity @xmath350 @xmath351 at the peak maximum appears to be smaller than the experimental one , which is about @xmath352 @xmath351.@xcite another effect of the jtd is the redistribution of the in - plane conductivity around @xmath353 ev , in the region of bonding - antibonding transition .",

    "formally , the basic de picture is sufficient to understand the local stability .",
    "the jtd significantly reduces the fm de contribution to the afm bonds , and in this way widens the region of local stability of the zigzag afm ordering .",
    "it appears that in the wide range of parameters @xmath120 , the zigzag afm ordering is stable not only locally , but also globally , meaning that this is indeed the magnetic ground state of the system .",
    "we also expect the anisotropy of optical properties , which is related with the distribution of the @xmath5 states at the corner atoms of the zigzag chain .",
    "the two - fold degeneracy of the @xmath5 levels plays a very important role in the problem , and is responsible for the insulating behavior and the orbital ordering developed at the bridge sites of the zigzag chain .",
    "thus , we believe that the nature of the low - temperature ce state in manganites is magnetic .",
    "the charge ordering reduces mobility of the @xmath5 electrons and tends to destroy the ferromagnetic coupling within the chain .",
    "therefore , it is expected to be small and play only minor role in the problem .",
    "applicability of this picture to the high - temperature regime is still in question .",
    "particularly , many charge ordered manganites are characterized by the existence of two transition temperatures : the long - range afm ordering occurs below the nel temperature @xmath365 , whereas the charge and orbital ordering orderings occur simultaneously below another critical temperature @xmath366 . in accordance with neutron scattering measurements , it holds @xmath365@xmath176@xmath366 ( see , e.g. , ref . ) .",
    "this fact is typically considered as the strong experimental evidence that the charge and orbital degrees of freedom play a decisive role in the interval @xmath365@xmath176@xmath367@xmath176@xmath366 and drive the afm ce ordering at @xmath365.@xcite however , other experimental data suggest that the exact nature of the state realized between @xmath365 and @xmath366 is much more complicated , and still far from the complete understanding .",
    "+ 1 ) some magnetic experiments simply  do no see  the existence of the transition point @xmath365 .",
    "for example , the behavior of spin magnetization in the external magnetic field shows the characteristic metamagnetic transition both below and above @xmath365 , which disappears only at @xmath366.@xcite the magnetic susceptibility shows a pronounced peak at @xmath366 and no anomaly at @xmath365.@xcite these data suggest that , although there is no long - range magnetic order , the magnetic fluctuations and the effects of short - range order continue to play a very important role in the interval @xmath365@xmath176@xmath367@xmath176@xmath366 .",
    "+ 2 ) the high - resolution electron microscopy clearly reveals the existence of the one - dimensional chains ( stripes ) even above @xmath365 , though the exact from of the stripes is not quite clear yet.@xcite it is also not clear whether these stripes have a magnetic origin or not .",
    "if they do , it would be a strong argument in the favor of the magnetic scenario considered in the present work , although the perfect geometry of the fm zigzag chain may be destroyed at elevated temperatures . in this respect ,",
    "an interesting theoretical result has been obtained by hotta _",
    "et  al_. they argued that the class of one - dimensional zigzag objects , which preserves the insulating behavior at @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13 is actually much wider and is not limited by the zigzag chain shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.chains ] .",
    "all these new zigzag configuration have higher energies , and therefore are not realized as the ground state at low temperatures .",
    "however , they may carry a considerable weight in the thermodynamics averages and therefore contribute to the high - temperature behavior of the charge ordered manganites .",
