    ", hydrogen can be catalyzed in nearly all parahydrogen .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a free energy density functional for liquid parahydrogen .",
    "our approach is largely inspired by density functional methods currently employed to study liquid helium at very low temperature.@xcite indeed , the ph@xmath0 molecule and the @xmath4he atom have in common that both are spinless bosons subject to a weak van der waals interaction .",
    "while helium remains liquid down to @xmath5 k , the stable low - temperature bulk phase of hydrogen , in spite of the lighter mass of the ph@xmath0 molecule , is an hpc solid .",
    "this is a consequence of the attractive interaction between two ph@xmath0 molecules , which is a factor of four stronger than the he - he one .",

    "ginzburg and sobyanin@xcite have suggested that liquid parahydrogen could exhibit superfluidity , analogously to liquid helium , below some critical temperature that they estimated to be at around 6  k. to have superfluid ph@xmath0 it is therefore necessary to bring the liquid below its saturated vapor pressure curve .",

    "<S> a finite - temperature density functional approach to describe the properties of parahydrogen in the liquid - vapor coexistence region is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the first proposed functional is zero - range , where the density - gradient term is adjusted so as to reproduce the surface tension of the liquid - vapor interface at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the second functional is finite - range and , while it is fitted to reproduce bulk ph@xmath0 properties only , it is shown to yield surface properties in good agreement with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> these functionals are used to study the surface thickness of the liquid - vapor interface , the wetting transition of parahydrogen on a planar rb model surface , and homogeneous cavitation in bulk liquid ph@xmath0 . </S>",
