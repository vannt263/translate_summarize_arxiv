    "an earlier theoretical paper@xcite ( hereafter i ) on magnetization steps from a diluted heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice was largely devoted to the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) cluster model . to obtain magnetization steps ( mst s ) ,",
    "the nn exchange constant 1 must be antiferromagnetic ( af ) .",
    "the present paper discusses cluster models with two exchange constants : the largest , called 1 , and the second - largest , 2 .",
    "both exchange constants are assumed to be af .",
    "some of the discussion in the present paper applies to any 1 - 2 cluster model , regardless of the neighbors associated with 1 and 2 .",
    "however , the main focus is on the 1 - 2 and 1 - 3 models . in these models",
    "@xmath7 , and 2 is either the second - neighbor exchange constant 2 , or the third - neighbor exchange constant 3 .    as in i ,",
    "the following assumptions are made : 1 ) thermal equilibrium , at temperature @xmath0 and magnetic field @xmath1 , prevails .",
    "2 ) all the magnetic ions are identical .",
    "3 ) the cation sites form a square lattice , and the magnetic ions are randomly distributed over these sites .",
    "4 ) only a fraction @xmath14 of all cations sites are occupied by magnetic ions .",
    "this fraction is well below the site percolation concentration @xmath15 for the relevant cluster model .",
    "5 ) none of the magnetic interactions is anisotropic .",
    "background material for the present paper may be found in i , in a recent review,@xcite and in earlier papers.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the principal results are presented in the main text .",
    "supplementary material is relegated to appendices .",
    "the main text starts with a brief discussion of the crucial role of cluster `` configurations '' in the theory .",
    "all cluster types in the 1 - 2 and 1 - 3 models , subject to the restriction @xmath8 on the cluster size @xmath16 , are then identified .",
    "the statistics for these cluster types is expressed using perimeter polynomials ( pp s ) for cluster types . as discussed in i ,",
    "the pp s for cluster types are analogous to the conventional pp s for cluster sizes.@xcite    the contribution of any cluster type to the magnetization @xmath10 is calculated by combining the results for the energy eigenvalues with those for the cluster statistics of that cluster type .",
    "the total magnetization @xmath17 is the sum of the contributions from all cluster types . in some respects",
    "the derivative curve , @xmath12  versus @xmath1 , is more informative than the magnetization curve , @xmath10 versus @xmath1 .",
    "examples of calculated magnetization and derivative curves at constant @xmath0 are given for widely different ratios @xmath11 .",
    "the statistics for cluster types is independent of the spin @xmath18 of the individual magnetic ions .",
    "however , the energy eigenvalues , and therefore the magnetization curve , depend on @xmath18 .",
    "although much of the discussion is for any @xmath18 , all the numerical examples are for @xmath19 , which is the appropriate value for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 ions .",
    "both theses ions are @xmath18-state ions , and they usually have low crystalline anisotropy .",
    "such ions are useful for testing theories in which anisotropy is neglected .",
    "the structures of the magnetization and derivative curves are much simpler when the ratio @xmath11  is `` very small . ''",
    "cluster models with such widely different magnitudes of 2 and 1 are called `` lopsided cluster models . ''",
    "in addition to their interesting physics , lopsided models are useful because they apply to many materials .",
    "lopsided cluster models are discussed in detail in the following paper.@xcite",
    "the calculation of the magnetization @xmath22 in any cluster model requires : 1 ) the identification of all cluster types @xmath23 in that model ; 2 ) a calculation of the average magnetic moment @xmath24 per realization,@xcite for each cluster type @xmath23 ; and 3 ) an evaluation of the probabilities of finding the various cluster types .    before carrying out the first and third of these tasks it is necessary to identify all the `` cluster configurations '' that exist in the particular cluster model .",
    "these cluster configurations are the fundamental building blocks of the theory , and also of the computer programs that are used to implement the theory .",
    "cluster configurations were discussed in sec .",
    "iiib of i. the discussion below brings out some new features .",
    "a spin cluster consists of a finite number of exchange - coupled magnetic ions ( spins ) that occupy a set of cation sites .",
    "spin clusters are considered to have the same configuration if and only if the sets of cation sites occupied by these clusters can be obtained from each other by symmetry operations of the space group of the cation structure .",
    "each one such set of cation sites is called a `` realization '' of the configuration .",
    "the symmetry operations of the space group of the cation structure are the only symmetry operations considered in the present work .",
    "they will be referred to , simply , as `` symmetry operations . ''",
    "the symmetry operations that are relevant to the present work are the operations of the @xmath25 space group of the square lattice , including the lattice translations .",
    "realizations of the same configuration have the following important geometrical property . starting from one realization ,",
    "a rigid object can be constructed by joining all pairs of cation sites in that realization by straight - line segments .",
    "the straight - line segments may be viewed as `` struts '' that give the object its rigidity .",
    "rigid objects constructed in this manner from different realizations of the same configuration , either have identical shapes or are chiral isomers ( mirror images ) of each other . because of this geometrical property , configurations of clusters",
    "are sometimes viewed as the geometrical shapes of clusters .",
    "a cluster model is specified by the set of exchange constants ( the @xmath13 s ) that are included in the model .",
    "any spin cluster in this model consists of spins that are coupled to each other , but not to other spins , by the @xmath13 s of the model .",
    "thus , any two spins in a cluster are connected by at least one continuous path of exchange bonds associated with this set of @xmath13 s .",
    "no continuous path of such exchange bonds is allowed to exist between spins in different clusters .",
    "the restriction on the allowed @xmath13 s is a restriction on the allowed sets of cation sites associates with the clusters of the model .",
    "for example , in the 1 - 2 model , any cation site of a cluster must have a nn site or a 2nd - neighbor site in the same cluster .",
    "the cluster configurations of the model are all the configurations of the sets of cation sites that are allowed by the @xmath13 s of the model .      sometimes , several cluster models are considered .",
    "it may then happen that the set of @xmath13 s in one cluster model is only a subset of all the exchange constants in another cluster model .",
    "any cluster configuration in the cluster model with the fewer @xmath13 s is then also a configuration in the model with the larger set of @xmath13 s .",
    "for example , the exchange constant 1 of the nn cluster model is a subset of the exchange constants in the 1 - 2 model .",
    "any cluster configuration in the 1 model is also a configuration in the 1 - 2 model .",
    "the converse is not true ; many cluster configurations that exist in the 1 - 2 model do not exist the 1 model .",
    "for the same reason , all cluster configurations that exist in the 1 model also exist in the 1 - 3 model .",
    "figure  2 of i shows an example of the same configuration in different cluster models .",
    "figure  2(b ) of i shows the configuration in the 1 model , and figs .",
    "2(c ) and 2(d ) show the same configuration in the 1 - 2 and 1 - 3 models , respectively .",
    "once a cluster model is specified , it is necessary to identify the cluster types that exist in the model . in the present work",
    "this identification was carried out by a series of computer program .",
    "the first set of programs identified all the ( different ) configurations that exist in the specified cluster model . for each configuration ,",
    "a realization that has one spin at the origin was generated .",
    "this realization is called the `` prototype '' of the configuration .",
    "only configurations with no more than 5 cation sites were considered explicitly in the present work .",
    "a cluster type @xmath23 is specified by a cluster size @xmath16 and by a bond list.@xcite to identify the cluster types that exist in the model , the prototypes of all the ( different ) configurations were first classified by size , i.e. , by the number of spins in the prototype .",
    "the next step was to generate the bond lists for all prototypes of a given size , @xmath16 .",
    "the final step was to identify all prototypes of the same size @xmath16 that have identical bond lists .",
    "such prototypes are , by definition,@xcite realizations of the same cluster type , @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , they are the prototypes of all the configurations @xmath26 of cluster type @xmath23 .",
    "to summarize , the classification of the prototypes of different configurations by both size and bond list leads to : 1 ) all cluster types @xmath23 , for each cluster size @xmath16 ; 2 ) the bond list for each of these cluster types ; and 3 ) the prototypes of all the configurations of each cluster type .",
    "the goal of the statistics is to find , for each cluster type @xmath23 , the probability @xmath27 that a randomly - chosen spin is in one of the realizations of this cluster type .",
    "the main assumption is that the magnetic ions are randomly distributed over the cation sites .",
    "the procedure for calculating @xmath27 as a function of @xmath14 was outlined in sec .",
    "iii c of i. the procedure starts from the configurations @xmath26 of cluster type @xmath23 .",
    "any realization of cluster type @xmath23 must also be a realization of one of the configurations @xmath26 of that cluster type .",
    "the probability @xmath28 that a randomly - chosen spin is in some realization of the configuration @xmath26 is given by eq .",
    "( 4 ) of i. this equation contains two parameters that depend on the configuration : the lattice - combinatorial parameter @xmath29 , and the perimeter @xmath30 .",
    "after these two parameters are evaluated for each of the configurations @xmath26 , the probability @xmath27 is obtained by summing @xmath28 over all the configurations @xmath26 of cluster type @xmath23 .",
    "this sum is given by eq .",
    "( 5 ) of i.    the lattice - combinatorial parameter @xmath29 is the number of ( distinct ) realizations of the configuration @xmath26 that have one spin at the origin .",
    "this @xmath29 depends only on the configuration .",
    "if the same configuration exists in more than one cluster model , then the corresponding lattice - combinatorial parameters are the same in all these models .",
    "the computer program that was used to obtain @xmath29 was based on the principle that all realizations of a configuration can be generated from the prototype of the configuration by applying the symmetry operations of the @xmath25 space group , including the lattice translations .",
    "if the same realization was generated by different symmetry operations , the count for @xmath29 included this realization only once .",
    "in contrast to @xmath29 , the perimeter @xmath30 depends not only on the configuration but also on the cluster model .",
    "if the same configuration exists in two cluster models , the perimeters in the two models are , in general , not equal .",
    "for example , any configuration that is present in the 1 model is also present in the 1 - 2 model .",
    "the perimeter in the 1 model will be called the 1 perimeter . given any realization of the configuration @xmath26 , the 1 perimeter is the number of ( cation ) sites that are nn s of the sites in the realization , but are not themselves sites of the realization .",
    "the perimeter in the 1 - 2 model ( called the 1 - 2 perimeter ) is the number of sites that are either nn s and/or 2nd - neighbors of the sites in the realization , but are not themselves sites of the realization .",
    "therefore , for the same configuration , the 1 - 2 perimeter is larger than the 1 perimeter . as a consequence ,",
    "the probability that a randomly - chosen spin is in a realization of this configuration will be lower in the 1 - 2 model than in the 1 model [ see eq .",
    "( 4 ) of i ] .",
    "similar results apply to a configuration that exists in both the 1 and the 1 - 3 models .",
    "a 1 - 2 cluster model in which the symmetry classes of the neighbors associated with 1 and 2 are not specified will be called a `` generic '' model .",
    "if the symmetry classes of the neighbors are specified , the cluster model is `` specific '' rather than generic . in this paper , only two specific 1 - 2 models are considered : the 1 - 2 model ( with @xmath31 ) , and the 1 - 3 model ( with @xmath32 ) .",
    "the reason for focusing on these specific models is that exchange constants often tend to decrease as the distance @xmath33 of the relevant neighbor increases . although the decrease is not always monotonic,@xcite we expect that in the vast majority of diluted antiferromagnets with a square cation lattice , @xmath7 and 2 is either 2 or 3 .",
    "the cluster types in the 1 - 2 model are not trivially related to the cluster types in the 1 - 3 model .",
    "that is , the bond lists for the two models can not be obtained from each other by replacing the 2 bonds by 3 bonds .",
    "the site percolation concentrations for these two specific models are also different.@xcite the non - trivial dependence of the bond lists , and hence of the cluster types , on the specific cluster model implies that bond lists and cluster types can not be given for a generic model . they can only be given for a specific model .",
    "the `` parent '' cluster models of the 1 - 2 model are the 1 model and the 2 model , each of which has only one of exchange constants of the 1 - 2 model .",
    "the 1 - 2 model is not a simple combination of its parent models .",
    "similarly , the 1 - 3 model is not a simple combination of the 1 and 3 models , which are its parent models .",
    "there are many interesting relations between the 1 - 2 and 1 - 3 models and their respective parent models . to avoid repeated interruptions in the main text of the paper ,",
    "discussions of these relations are relegated to appendices . for the limited purpose of calculating magnetization curves numerically ,",
    "the results in these appendices are not essential",
    ". however , these results give a deeper insight into the physics . some of these results will be quoted , and used , in the main texts of the present paper and of the following paper .",
    "appendix  [ a : iso ] , describes the strong similarity ( called `` isomorphism '' ) between the three parent models , i.e. , the 1 , 2 , and 3 models .",
    "these are the only `` parent models '' considered in the present work .                in the 1 - 2 model on the square lattice , there are 67 cluster types of sizes @xmath8 . these cluster types are shown in 12 .",
    "cluster types of the same size , @xmath16 , appear in the same column .",
    "the four columns in 1 show the cluster types with @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the single column in 2 shows the cluster types with @xmath36 .",
    "spins are represented by solid circles , 1 bonds by solid lines , and 2 bonds by dotted lines .",
    "only one configuration for each cluster type is shown .",
    "the bond lists for these cluster types , which specify all intra - cluster exchange interactions,@xcite are given in appendix  [ a : bondlists ] .",
    "each cluster type is labeled by two numbers separated by a hyphen .",
    "the first number is the cluster size @xmath16 .",
    "the second is a serial number ( sn ) within this cluster size .",
    "thus , the format for any label is [ @xmath16-(sn ) ] .",
    "there is only one type of single ( type 1 - 1 ) , but two types of pairs : 2 - 1 which is a 1-pair , and 2 - 2 which is a 2-pair .",
    "there are four types of triplets ( @xmath37 ) , 15 types of quartets ( @xmath38 ) , and 45 types of quintets ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the number of cluster types in 12 is rather large .",
    "it is therefore useful to classify them .",
    "the classification scheme is not unique . in one scheme",
    "the 67 cluster types in 12 are divided into four broad categories :    1 .",
    "`` single , '' which has no exchange bonds ; 2 .",
    "`` pure 1 '' cluster types , with only 1 exchange bonds ; 3 .",
    "`` pure 2 '' cluster types , with only 2 bonds ; 4 .",
    "`` mixed '' cluster types , with both 1 and 2 bonds .",
    "the single ( type 1 - 1 ) is at the left of the bottom row of 1 .",
    "the only pure 2 cluster types are the other 5 cluster types in the same bottom row together with the four cluster types in the bottom row of 2 .",
    "the only pure 1 cluster types are : 2 - 1 , 3 - 1 , 4 - 1 , and 5 - 1 .",
    "all the remaining 53 cluster types are `` mixed '' types .    the pure 1 cluster types , and the pure 2 cluster types , are related to cluster types in the ( parent ) 1 and 2 models , respectively .",
    "these relations are discussed in appendix  [ a : relations ] .      in the 1 - 3 model",
    "there are 82 cluster types of sizes @xmath8 .",
    "they are shown in 34 .",
    "the format is the same as in 12 , except that the dotted lines now represent 3 bonds .",
    "the bond lists for the cluster types in 34 are given in appendix  [ a : bondlists ] .",
    "the labels for the cluster types of the 1 - 3 model have the same format as those for the cluster types in the 1 - 2 model . therefore , many of the labels used in the two models models are identical . when the same label appears in both models , it often refers to different cluster types ( i.e. , different bond lists ) .",
    "unless it is clear from the context , it is then necessary to specify the cluster model to which the label refers .",
    "once again the cluster types in 34 can be divided into four categories :    1 .   the `` single '' ( type 1 - 1 ) , at the left of the bottom row of 3 ; 2 .   the 9 `` pure 3 '' cluster types , consisting of the other 5 cluster types in the bottom row of 3 together with the 4 cluster types in the bottom row of 4 ; 3 .",

    "the probabilities @xmath27 as a function of @xmath14 were obtained using the procedure discussed in sec .  [ ss : iic ] . only cluster types with @xmath8 were considered . some of the results for the 1 - 2 model are shown 5 .",
    "they include the @xmath27 s for the single ( type 1 - 1 ) , for the two types of pairs ( 2 - 1 and 2 - 2 ) , and for the four types of triplets ( 3 - 1 , 3 - 2 , 3 - 3 and 3 - 4 ) .",
