    "microquasars are well known miniatures of quasars , with a central black hole ( bh ) , an accretion disk and two relativistic jets very similar to those found in the centers of active galaxies , only on much smaller scales ( mirabel @xmath2 radrguez 1999 ) . since discovered in 1992 , radio jets",

    "2001 ) , and large scale diffuse emission , e.g. ss433 ( dubner et al . 1998 ) , were also detected .",
    "xte j1550 - 564 was discovered with rxte during its strong x - ray outburst on september 7 , 1998 ( smith 1998 ) .",
    "it is believed to be an x - ray binary system at a distance of @xmath05.3 kpc , containing a black hole of 10.5@xmath41.0 solar masses and a low mass companion star ( orosz et al .",
    "2002 ) . soon after the discovery of the source , a jet ejection with an apparent velocity greater than 2@xmath3 was reported ( hannikainen et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the period between 1998 and 2002 ,",
    "several other outbursts occurred but no similar radio and x - ray flares were detected again in these outbursts ( tomsick et al .",
    "2003 ) .    with the help of the _ chandra _ satellite , corbel",
    "et al ( 2002 ) found two large scale x - ray jets lying to the east and the west of the central source , which were also in good alignment with the central source .",
    "the eastern jet has been detected first in 2000 at a projected distance of @xmath021@xmath5 from the central black hole .",
    "two years later , the jet could only be seen marginally in the x - ray image , while a western counterpart became visible at @xmath022@xmath5 on the other side .",
    "the corresponding radio maps are consistent with the x - ray observations ( corbel et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "there are altogether eight two - dimentional imaging observations of xte j1550 - 564 in _",

    "we report a full analysis of these x - ray data , together with the kinematic and spectral evolution fittings for all these observations .",
    "the basic information of observations 1@xmath08 is listed in table 1 , including the observation i d , date , and the angular separation between the eastern and western jets and the central source .",
    "the positions are obtained by the _",
    "chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) routine @xmath6 ( freeman et al . 2002 ) . in observations 5 and 6 ,",
    "no x - ray source is detected by @xmath6 at the position of the eastern jet . however , from the smoothed images ( fig.1 ) , a weak source could be recognized in observation 6 .",
    "we thus select the center of the strongest emission region as one data point .",
    "we calculate the source centroid for the central source and the x - ray jet respectively and for all the five observations , the calculated position changed by less than 0.5 . therefore , an upper limit of 0.5@xmath5 is set for the error of the jet distance .    .",

    "observation 4 shows the good alignment of the two jets and the central source . ]    from table 1 and fig.1 , we could see clearly that an x - ray emission source is detected to the east of the central source in the first four observations and another source is detected to the west in the last five observations .",
    "calculations also show that these two sources , when presented in a single combined image , are in good alignment with the central compact object with an inclination angle of 85.9@xmath40.3 . by calculating the average proper motion , an approximate estimate of deceleration",
    "could be seen for both jets .",
    "since the emission from the eastern jet has been studied fully ( corbel et al .",
    "2002 ; tomsick et al .",
    "2003 ) , we mainly focus our spectral analysis on the western jet .",
    "the x - ray spectrum in 0.3 - 8 kev energy band is extracted for each observation of the western jet .",
    "we use a circular source region with a radius of 4 , an annular background region with an inner radius of 5@xmath5 and an outer radius of 15 , for each observation .",
    "instrument response matrices ( rmf ) and weighted auxiliary response files ( warf ) are created using ciao programs mkacisrmf and mkwarf , and then added to the spectra .",
    "we re - bin the spectra with 10 counts per bin and fit them in _",
    "xspec_.    the results of spectra fitting with an absorbed power - law model",
    "are also shown in table 1 .",
    "we use the cash statistic since it is a better method when counts are low .",

    "in the external shock model for afterglows of grbs , the kinematic and radiation evolution could be understood as the interaction between the outburst ejecta and the surrounding ism ( rees & mszros 1992 ) .",
    "microquasar jet systems are also expected to encounter such interactions . in this section ,",
    "we describe our attempts after wang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in constructing the kinetic and radiation model based on these models .",
    "we adopt the model of a collimated conical beam with a half opening angle @xmath16 expanding into the ambient medium with the number density @xmath17 .",
    "the initial kinetic energy and lorentz factor of the outflow material are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "shocks should arise as the outflow moves on and heat the ism , and its kinetic energy will turn into the internal energy of the medium gradually .",
    "neglect the radiation loss , the energy conservation function writes ( huang , dai , & lu 1999 ) : @xmath20 where the first term on the left of the equation represents the kinematic energy of the ejecta , @xmath21 is the lorentz factor and @xmath22 is the mass of the original ejecta .",
    "the second term represent the internal energy of the swept - up ism , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the corresponding lorentz factor and mass of the shocked ism respectively , and @xmath25 .",
    "coefficient @xmath26 differs from 6/17 to 0.73 for ultra - relativistic and nonrelativistic jets ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) .",
    "we adopt the approximation of @xmath270.7 after wang et al.(2003 ) .",
    "equation ( 1 ) and the relativistic kinematic equations @xmath28 can be solved and give the relation between the projected angular separation @xmath29 and time @xmath30 . in equations ( 2 ) , the subscript ` a ' and ` r ' represent the approaching and receding jets in a pair of relativistic jets respectively .",
    "@xmath31 is the distance between the jet and the source , which can be transformed into the proper motion separation by @xmath32 kpc , and @xmath33 is the jet inclination angle to the line of sight .",
    "we can get the @xmath34 curve numerically with the above equations . to be consistent with the work previously done to the eastern jet , we choose the same initial conditions that @xmath35 , @xmath36 erg , and @xmath37 . then the parameters needed to be fit are @xmath17 and @xmath33 .    in the case of the eastern jet , the number density of the ism was assumed as a constant in the whole region outside the central source ( wang et al .",
    "this assumption does not work well in the case of its western counterpart .",
    "the western jet decelerated quite fast , requiring a local dense environment ; however if the ism is dense everywhere , the jet will be unable to travel that far from the central point source . as a result",
    ", we consider a model that the ism density varies as the distance changes . for simplicity ,",
    "we test the ideal case that the jet travelled first through a  cavity \" with a constant velocity and then through a dense region where the jet was decelerated .",
    "a new parameter @xmath38 , the outer radius of the cavity , is introduced and the ism number density is set to be a constant @xmath17 outside this region and zero inside .",
    "the fittings improved a lot , but not well constrained because of the limited number of the data points . a combination of lightcurve fitting is required to further constrain the model parameters .",
    "in the standard grb scenario , the afterglow emission is produced by the synchrotron radiation or inverse compton emission of the accelerated electrons in the shock front of the jets ( wang et al .",
    "2003 and references there ) .",
    "wang et al.(2003 ) found that the reverse shock emission , originating from the electrons of the jet when a shock moves back through the ejecta , decay rather fast and describe the data of the eastern jet quite well .",
    "we thus take this model in our work as well .",
    "assuming the distribution of the electrons obeys a power - law form , @xmath39 , for @xmath40 , the volume emissivity at frequency @xmath41 in the comoving frame is given by ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the bessel function .",
    "the physical quantities in these equations include @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the charge and mass of the electron , @xmath48 , the magnetic field strength perpendicular to the electron velocity , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the characteristic frequencies for electrons with @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "assuming the reverse shock heats the ejecta at time @xmath53 at the radius @xmath54 , the physical quantities in the adiabatically expanding ejecta with radius @xmath31 will evolve as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where the initial values of these quantities are free parameters to be fitted in the calculation . with these assumptions",
    ", we can then calculate the predicted flux evolution of the jets .",
    "the comoving frequency @xmath41 relates to our observer frequency @xmath57 by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the doppler factor and we have @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the approaching and receding jets respectively . considering the geometry of the emission region , the observed x - ray flux in 0.3 - 8 kev band could be estimated by @xmath62d\\nu,\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the width of the shock region and is assumed to be @xmath64 in the calculation .    to reduce the number of free parameters",
    ", we set @xmath65 in our calculation because the results are quite insensitive to this value .",
    "we choose the time that the reverse shock takes place according to our kinematic model in section 3.1 .",
    "then we fit the data to find out the initial values of @xmath66 and @xmath48 .",
    "next step , we combine the kinematic and radiation fitting together . we know that the energy and the number density of the gas in the pre - shock and post - shock regions are connected by the jump conditions @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are coefficients related to the jet velocity",
    ". therefore if we assume the shocked electrons and the magnetic field acquire constant fractions ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) of the total shock energy , we have @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "if we further assume that the @xmath71 of the eastern and the western jets is the same , we may infer that @xmath76 for the two jets . as a result",
    ", we search for the combination of parameters that could satisfy the kinematic and radiation fitting , as well as the relationship @xmath77 .",
    "a set of parameters has finally been found ( please refer to the _ left _ panel in fig.2 ) .",
    "the boundary of the cavity lies at @xmath7814@xmath5 to the east and @xmath018@xmath5 to the west of the central source .",
    "the corresponding number density of the ism outside this boundary is @xmath00.00675 @xmath1 and @xmath00.21 @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "both values are lower than the canonical ism value of @xmath01 @xmath1 , although the value in the western region is much higher than that in the eastern region .",
    "the electron energy fraction relationship is satisfied as @xmath79 . on the other hand ,",
    "the other relation concerning the magnetic field strength could not be satisfied simultaneously by these parameters .",
    "although the cavity radius and the number density are allowed to vary significantly , the best fitted magnetic field strength remains quite stable(@xmath00.4 - 0.6 mg ) .",
    "one possible interpretation for this is that the equipartition parameter varies as the physical conditions of the jet varies ; an alternative explanation may involve the _ in situ _ generation ( or amplification ) of the magnetic field .",

    "these studies led us to the suggestion that in microquasars the interactions between the ejecta and the environmental gas play major roles in the jet evolution and the low density of the environment is a necessary requirement for the jet to develop to a long distance .",
    "we find that microquasar jets can be classified into roughly three groups : small scale moving jets , large scale moving jets and large scale jet relics .",
    "for the first type , the  small jets \" , only radio emissions are detected .",
    "the jets are always relatively close to the central source and dissipate very quickly , including grs 1915 + 105 ( rodrguez & mirabel 1999 ; miller - jones et al . 2007 ) , gro j1655 - 40 ( hjellming & rupen 1995 ) , and cyg x-3 ( marti et al .",
    "the typical spatial scale is 0@xmath00.05 pc and the time scale is several tenths of days . no obvious deceleration is observed before the jets become too faint . for the second type ,",
    "the  large jets \" , both x - ray and radio detections are obtained , at a place far from the central source several years after the outburst .",
    "examples are xte j1550 - 564 , h1743 - 322 , and gx 339 - 4 ( gallo et al.2004 ) .",
    "the typical jet travelling distance for this type is 0.2@xmath00.5 pc from the central engine and deceleration is clearly observed .",
    "the last type , the  large relics \" , is a kind of diffuse structures observed in radio , optical and x - ray band , often ring or nebula shaped that are not moving at all . in this class , some well studied sources , cygnus x-1 ( gallo et al.2005 ) , ss433 ( dubner el al.1998 ) , circinus x-1 ( stewart et al . 1993 ) , 1e  1740.7 - 2942 ( mirabel et al .",
    "1992 ) and grs 1758 - 258 ( rodrguez et al .",
    "1992 ) are included .",
    "the typical scale for this kind is 1@xmath030 pc , an order of magnitude larger than the second type .",
    "the estimated lifetime often exceeds one million years , indicating that they are related to previous outbursts .    from these properties ,",
    "it is reasonable to further suggest a consistent picture involving all the sources together .",
    "we make a conjecture that large scale cavities exist in all microquasar systems .",
    "the  small jets \" observed right after the ejection are just travelling through these cavities . since there are few or none interactions between the jets and the surrounding gas in this region , the jets travel without obvious deceleration .",
    "the emission mechanism is synchrotron radiation by particles accelerated in the initial outburst .",
    "the emissions of jets decay very quickly and are not detectable after several tenths of days . in some cases ( e.g. xte j1550 - 564 )",
    ", the cavity has a dense ( compared to the cavity interior ) boundary at some radius and the interactions between the jets and the boundary gas heat the particles again and thus make the jets detectable again .",
    "those are the  large jets \" .",
    "the emission mechanism then is synchrotron radiation by the re - heated particles in the external shocks .",
    "then , after these interactions , the jets lost most of their kinetic energy into the ism gradually , causing the latter to expand to large scale structures , the  large relics \" , in a comparatively long time ( several millions of years ) .    the creation of the cavities is not clear at this stage",
    ". possible mechanism may involve supernovae explosions , companion star winds or disk winds .",
    "since some of the sources most likely have never had supernovae before and the winds from the companion stars are not strong enough , the accretion disk winds may be the most plausible possibility . however , these assumptions all require further observations to justify .",
    "microquasars are powerful probes of both the central engine and their surrounding environment .",
    "more studies of their jet behaviors may give us information on the ism gas properties , as well as the ejecta components .",
    "it will provide insights of the jet formation process and offer another approach into black hole physics and accretion flow dynamics .",
