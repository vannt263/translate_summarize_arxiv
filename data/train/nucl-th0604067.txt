    "the @xmath0-nucleus interaction near threshold is strongly attractive and absorptive as suggested by fits to the strong - interaction shifts and widths in @xmath2-atom levels@xcite .",
    "global fits yield ` deep ' optical potentials @xmath7 mev @xcite , whereas other , more theoretically inclined works that fit the low - energy @xmath8 reaction data , including the @xmath9 unstable bound state @xmath10 as input for constructing a density dependent optical potential , suggest relatively ` shallow ' potentials with @xmath11 mev @xcite .",
    "the issue of the depth of the attractive @xmath0-nucleus potential is briefly reviewd in sections [ sec : shallow],[sec : deep ] .",
    "it is instructive at this introductory stage to mention that irrespective of the depth of the real part of the potential , and quite paradoxically due to its strong imaginary ( absorptive ) part , relatively narrow @xmath2 _ deeply bound atomic states _ were predicted to exist@xcite , also confirmed in ref .",
    "figure [ fig : kpb ] from ref .",
    "@xcite shows on the left - hand side a calculated spectrum of @xmath2 atomic states in @xmath12pb where , in particular , all the circular states below the @xmath13 state are not populated by x - ray transitions due to the strong @xmath2-nuclear absorption , and on the right - hand side it demonstartes saturation of the @xmath14 atomic - state width as a function of the absorptivity parameter i m  @xmath15 of the optical potential .",
    "the physics behind is that a strong imaginary part of @xmath16 acts repulsively , suppressing the _ atomic _ wavefunction in the region of overlap with i m  @xmath16 .",
    "the calculated width of the ` deeply bound ' atomic @xmath17 and @xmath14 is less than 2 mev , calling for experimental ingenuity how to form these levels selectively by a non radiative process@xcite .",
    "relatively narrow @xmath18 deeply bound atomic states were also predicted , due to the same width saturation mechanism@xcite .",
    "this saturation mechanism does not hold for nuclear states which retain very good overlap with the potential .",
    "hence , the question to ask is whether it is possible at all to bind _ strongly _ @xmath0 mesons in nuclei and are such bound states sufficiently narrow to allow observation and identification ?",
    "the current experimental and theoretical interest in this question was triggered back in 1999 by the suggestion of kishimoto@xcite to look for such states in the nuclear reaction @xmath19 in flight , and by akaishi and yamazaki@xcite who suggested to look for a @xmath20 @xmath9 state bound by over 100 mev for which the main @xmath1 decay channel would be kinematically closed . some experimental evidence has been presented recently for candidate states in @xmath21 and @xmath22 reactions on @xmath23he ( kek - ps e471,@xcite respectively ) , in the @xmath24 in - flight reaction on @xmath25o ( bnl - ags , parasite e930 @xcite ) , and in @xmath26 reactions in li and @xmath27c , observing back - to - back @xmath28 pairs from @xmath29 ( da@xmath30ne - finuda @xcite ) .",
    "none of it is sufficiently conclusive .",
    "it is interesting then to study theoretically @xmath0 nuclear states in the range of binding energy @xmath31 mev , as suggested by these recent experiments , and in particular the width anticipated for such deeply bound states .",
    "the relatively shallow @xmath0-nucleus potentials@xcite derived from the microscopic construction by ramos and oset@xcite , which are discussed in section [ sec : shallow ] , are of no use in this context , since they can not generate even within a dynamical calculation binding energies substantially greater than the potential depth of about 50 mev .",
    "one must therefore depart from the microscopic approach in favor of a more phenomenologically inclined model which is constrained by data other than two - body @xmath32 observables .",
    "the theoretical framework described here in section [ sec : rmf ] , due to mare , friedman and gal@xcite , is the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model for a system of nucleons and one @xmath0 meson interacting through the exchange of scalar ( @xmath33 ) and vector ( @xmath34 ) boson fields which are treated in the mean - field approximation .",
    "the rmf is a systematic approach used across the periodic table beyond the very light elements explored by other techniques , and it can be used also to study multi-@xmath0 configurations and to explore the @xmath0 condensation limit@xcite .",
    "similar rmf calculations have been recently reported by the frankfurt group for @xmath35 states in nuclei@xcite .",
    "the born approximation for the @xmath0-nucleus potential due to the leading - order tomozawa - weinberg ( tw ) vector term of the chiral effective lagrangian @xcite , @xmath36 where @xmath37 mev is the pseudoscalar meson decay constant , yields sizable attraction @xmath38 mev for @xmath39 @xmath40 . iterating the tw term plus next - to - leading - order terms , within an _ in - medium _ coupled - channel approach constrained by the @xmath41 data near the @xmath32 threshold , roughly doubles this @xmath0-nucleus attraction .",
    "it is found in these calculations ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the @xmath10 quickly dissolves in the nuclear medium at finite densities , well below @xmath42 , so that the repulsive free - space scattering length @xmath43 becomes _ attractive _ , and together with the weakly density dependent attractive @xmath44 it yields an attractive density dependent effective isoscalar scattering length @xmath45 , denoted here also as @xmath46 ( positive for attraction ) : @xmath47 leading to a strongly attractive @xmath0-nucleus optical potential : @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the @xmath32 reduced mass .",
    "however , when @xmath16 is calculated _ self consistently _ ( sc ) , namely by including @xmath16 in the in - medium propagator used in the lippmann - schwinger equation determining @xmath16 as a @xmath0-nucleus t matrix , the resultant @xmath0-nucleus potential is only moderatelly attractive , with depth between @xmath50  mev .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc ] , where the reduction of re  @xmath51 from the ( non sc ) dashed line to the ( sc ) solid line is clearly seen@xcite .",
    "the reason for this weakening of the t matrix , approximately back to its tw potential kernel eq .",
    "( [ eq : chiral ] ) , is the strong absorptive effect of @xmath16 in the @xmath0-nucleus propagator which suppresses the higher - order tw potential .",
    "it is the main reason that different theoretical calculations that obtain @xmath0-nucleus potential depths @xmath52  mev without requiring sc , find ultimately upon requiring sc depths @xmath53  mev at @xmath54@xcite .",
    "the akaishi and yamazaki scheme of calculation@xcite differs in many respects from the theoretical derivations here outlined .",
    "it gets rid of the @xmath55 coupled - channel effects too early in the calculation , essentially using a one - channel @xmath56 energy - independent complex potential that fits the @xmath57 scattering lengths and the position of the @xmath10 unstable bound state for @xmath9 .",
    "this kind of construction is far from being unique , certainly with respect to models that use a comprehensive set of @xmath56 low - energy data@xcite .",
    "furthermore , their analog of the tw potential kernel is considerably more attractive ; and moreover , they do not impose the sc requirement , and it appears that the absorptive effect mentioned above is missing in their scheme . therefore , their calculations have little common with the other ` theoretical ' calculations in this field .",
    "the @xmath2-atom data used in global fits@xcite span a range of nuclei from @xmath58li to @xmath59u , with 65 level - shift and -width data points . figure [ fig : v ] shows the real part and the imaginary part of the @xmath0-nucleus potential for @xmath60ni and @xmath12pb for a @xmath61 potential , where the complex strength @xmath62 is fitted to these data , and for two density - dependent potentials marked by dd and f , also fitted to the same data . for the real part , the depth of the @xmath61 potential for a typical medium - weight to heavy nucleus is about 80  mev , whereas the density - dependent potentials are considerably deeper , @xmath63  mev .",
    "these latter potentials also yield substantially lower @xmath64 values of 103 and 84 , respectively , than the value 129 for the @xmath61 potential .",
    "in particular , the shape of potential f departs appreciably from @xmath65 for @xmath66 , where the physics of the @xmath10 still plays a major role .",
    "we note that , although the two density - dependent potentials have very different parameterizations , the resulting potentials are quite similar . in model",

    "( [ eq : ddf ] ) , takes place at radii somewhat outside of the nuclear ` half - density ' radius .",
    "consequently , @xmath16 departs in shape from @xmath65 for densities less than about 20% of the central density .",
    "in this model , expanded in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ( anti)kaon interaction with the nuclear medium is incorporated by adding to @xmath74 the lagrangian density @xmath75 @xcite : @xmath76 the covariant derivative @xmath77 describes the coupling of the ( anti)kaon to the vector meson @xmath78 .",
    "the coupling of the ( anti)kaon to the isovector @xmath79 meson was neglected , a good approximation for the light @xmath80 nuclei . whereas extending the nuclear lagrangian @xmath74 by the lagrangian @xmath75 does not affect the original form of the corresponding dirac equation for nucleons , the presence of @xmath0 leads to additional source terms in the equations of motion for the meson fields @xmath33 and @xmath81 to which the @xmath0 couples .",
    "the @xmath0 thus affects the scalar and vector potentials which enter the dirac equation for nucleons , and this leads to a rearrangement or polarization of the nuclear core .    in order to preserve the connection to studies of @xmath2 atoms , the klein gordon ( kg ) equation of motion for the @xmath0",

    "since the rmf approach does not address the imaginary part of the potential , @xmath93 was taken in a phenomenological @xmath61 form , where its depth was fitted to the @xmath2 atomic data@xcite with i m  @xmath15 = 0.62  fm .",
    "note that the density @xmath79 in the present calculations is no longer a static nuclear density , but is a _ dynamical _ entity affected by the @xmath0 interacting with the nucleons via boson fields .",
