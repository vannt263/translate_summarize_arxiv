    "m31 contains hundreds of x - ray sources in a relatively small field .",
    "precision measurement of their positions allows identification of optical and radio counterparts .",
    "long - term monitoring of these sources provides variability information on timescales which are not probed by single observations .",
    "this information can help determine the nature of the x - ray sources .",
    "for example , x - ray binaries containing high and low mass secondaries have somewhat different variability , and snr are not expected to show any variability at all . by using the x - ray variability and luminosity information to determine the nature of the sources one can establish links to the stellar populations in which the sources reside .",
    "these links include the effects of star formation on the x - ray source population and the effects of galaxy evolution on x - ray source production .",
    "several surveys of m31 have been completed in x - rays , finding hundreds of sources , a large fraction of which are variable .",
    "most surveys have concentrated on the central bulge region , which contains most of the bright x - ray sources .",
    "these studies began with @xcite , who used einstein data to catalog 69 objects brighter than @xmath09@xmath810@xmath9 in the m31 bulge and northern m31 disk .",
    "@xcite found 2 variable x - ray point sources in the einstein data of m31 .",
    "later @xcite performed a deeper survey of more than half the m31 disk by combining all einstein data of m31 .",
    "they found 108 sources brighter than @xmath05@xmath810@xmath9 including fourteen additional variable sources .",
    "the central 34 arcmin of m31 was surveyed with the rosat hri @xcite , revealing 86 sources brighter than @xmath010@xmath9 . by comparison with previous einstein observations",
    ", they found nearly half of the sources in the bulge to be variable .",
    "two more rosat surveys were completed with the pspc @xcite .",
    "these surveys together covered most of the disk ( 10.7 deg@xmath10 ) and revealed 560 x - ray sources down to a detection limit of @xmath05@xmath810@xmath11 ; they found 34 sources varied in the 1 year between observations .",
    "recently , m31 has been studied with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory and xmm-_newton_. the improved resolution and sensitivity have led to additional interesting observations . for example , _ chandra _ observations have revealed several new x - ray transients @xcite , as have xmm observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed xmm-_newton _ and _ chandra _ observations of three of these which were discovered in the year 2000 . using xmm-_newton _ observations",

    "@xcite performed a survey of the central @xmath017@xmath12 of m31 with the _ chandra _ acis - i , finding 204 x - ray sources down to a detection limit of @xmath02@xmath810@xmath11 .",
    "about half of the sources were variable on timescales of months , and 13 sources were transients .",
    "@xcite used hrc - i data of the nuclear region to detect 142 sources brighter than @xmath02@xmath810@xmath11 , finding nearly half of the bright sources to be variable on timescales of @xmath1310 hours . @xcite",
    "performed a deep xmm-_newton _ survey of the northern half in the disk , finding that the m31 disk is deficient in bright x - ray sources .",
    "further xmm-_newton _ observations have discovered diffuse soft x - ray emission associated with the northern disk @xcite . @xcite",
    "surveyed three widely separated portions of the m31 disk with acis - i , finding possible differences between the x - ray source populations in these different regions .",
    "@xcite found that m31 globular clusters can be more x - ray luminous than those of the galaxy and suggested that this was due in part to the larger number of m31 globular clusters ( gcs ) rather than a difference in the shape of the luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "finally , @xcite have completed a survey for supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) and quasisoft sources ( qsss ) in four regions of m31 , finding 33 such objects .",
    "we have obtained _ chandra _ hrc - i data covering most of the m31 optical disk .",
    "these data provide the first opportunity to perform a large area survey of m31 with _",
    "chandra _ , including regular information about the state of the detected sources over a period of two and a half years . while the sensitivity and coverage ( 0.9 deg@xmath10 ) are not as extensive as that of @xcite which covered an area of 10.7  deg@xmath10 , the time baseline is well sampled .",
    "we have also obtained 3-epoch hst ( wfpc2 ) images of 2 newly discovered x - ray transients in order to search for their optical counterparts . among the deepest ground",
    "based images of m31 are those that were obtained as part of the local group survey project @xcite ; we analyze unpublished sections of these data in order to search for new optical counterparts . in this paper",
    "we use the _ chandra _ data to create an x - ray source catalog covering most of m31 and to measure long - term variability in the x - ray emission from these sources , and we use the newly obtained optical data to search for long wavelength counterparts . in ",

    "7 provides a summary of our conclusions .",
    "the data for this project are originally part of a survey program to look for x - ray transients in m31 . nearly every month from november of 1999 to february of 2001 ,",
    "_ chandra _ took hrc - i images of 5 fields covering most of m31 .",
    "observations were then made every few months until june of 2002 .",
    "each image was shallow ( @xmath01 ks ) but sufficient to detect any strong x - ray transients in the observed epoch .",
    "individual epochs of these data were of limited use for survey purposes because of their short exposure times , but herein we stack the data into a deeper 17 ks hrc - i mosaic of m31 .",
    "the observation i d ( obsid ) numbers , dates , exposure times and pointing coordinates of all of the observations are given in table  [ obslist ] .",
    "an exposure map of the stacked data is shown in figure  [ expmap ] , where the thick white outline marks the region of the data where the 6@xmath14 sensitivity is at least 1.3@xmath810@xmath15(0.9 deg@xmath10 ) .",
    "our lfs are complete to this luminosity ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "we focused on this region in our analysis to provide a constant area of known sensitivity limit .",
    "the combined , exposure corrected , background subtracted source image is shown in figure  [ sim ] .",
    "the image shows the majority of the sources are near the center of m31 .",
    "the areas near center of the galaxy with the highest exposure have a @xmath16 detection limit of @xmath01.5 @xmath8 10@xmath9 .",
    "in order to combine the data , they were first aligned using the ciao script _ align_evt _ , which corrects for small errors in the aspect solutions of different exposures by aligning the detected sources in the field .",
    "the images of the bulge contained @xmath05 sources suitable for this purpose , which allowed alignment to an rms accuracy of @xmath17 .",
    "unfortunately , in the disk , where there are fewer bright sources , this technique was less successful . in these outer regions ,",
    "the fields were aligned using the _ chandra _ aspect solution , which is accurate to @xmath01@xmath18 . in the uncrowded outer regions , we binned the data to a resolution of 2@xmath18 .",
    "this binning provided better detection of faint objects by removing the effects of the less precise alignment between exposures in the disk fields . in the central 18@xmath19 @xmath8 18@xmath19 of the galaxy , where the alignment was better , we binned the data to 1@xmath18 resolution in order to better match the instrumental point spread function ( psf ) . finally , we combined the data into 3 data sets using the task _",
    "merge_all_. one set contained the data for the northern half of the galaxy , another contained the southern half and the last contained the center .",
    "we searched for sources in the three data sets using the ciao task _",

    "the pixels in the merged images were 1@xmath18 in the central 18@xmath19 @xmath8 18@xmath19 and 2@xmath18 outside of this region . by searching on several scales _",
    "wavdetect _ is able to overcome the large changes in the size of of the _ chandra _ psf from about 0.5@xmath18 near the center of the field to over 10@xmath18 in the outer regions of the field .",
    "one hundred sixty - six sources were detected above our 3.5@xmath14 detection threshold .",
    "their short names , positions , detection counts , signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath20 ) , mean x - ray luminosities ( @xmath21 ; 0.110 kev ) , @xmath22 values for a fit to a constant source , counterparts or previous x - ray detections , and references for those counterparts and previous detections are provided in table  [ slist ] .",
    "detailed descriptions of all columns , including a definition of the source naming convention ( r1 , r2 , n1 , s2 , etc . ) are given in the notes to table  [ slist ] .",
    "to convert our measured mean x - ray fluxes to luminosities , we assumed a distance to m31 of 780 kpc , a photon index @xmath23 , and absorption @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "these assumptions provided a constant conversion factor of 2.5 @xmath8 10@xmath26 erg cm@xmath10 ct@xmath28 from hrc flux in ct @xmath25 s@xmath28 to luminosity ( 0.110 kev ) .",
    "we consulted previous surveys of the x - ray source background to set a limit on the number of possible background sources in our sample .",
    "rosat observations of the lockman hole @xcite show that there are @xmath1340 sources per square degree with luminosities greater than 4@xmath810@xmath9 .",
    "our large - area disk lf quickly falls off below this luminosity due to completeness ( cf .",
    "therefore we estimate that our entire catalog contains @xmath2940 background and/or foreground sources . near the center of m31",
    ", our data contain an area of 0.01 deg@xmath10 complete at 6@xmath14 to @xmath02.5 @xmath8 10@xmath9 ( see the area of highest exposure near the center of m31 in figure  [ expmap ] ) .",
    "this area should contain @xmath0100 background sources per deg@xmath10 @xcite , or 1 source in our most sensitive area , where we detect 41 sources .",
    "therefore contamination near the galaxy center is very small .    within the central 10 arcmin of m31 ,",
    "all but one of the non - transient sources in our list has been previously detected in the x - ray band .",
    "this region has been well studied with _",
    "chandra _ already @xcite .",
    "source r2 - 68 appears to be a clean new detection , with 19 counts and a s / n ration of 4.6 .",
    "while we do not detect any variations in the hrc snapshots of this source ( @xmath30 ) , the fact that it is not detected in the much deeper acis @xcite and 50ks  hrc exposures @xcite indicates it is variable .",
    "as shown in figure  [ varsen ] and discussed in  3.2 , our sensitivity to variability in the fainter sources of our survey , such as r2 - 68 , is limited .    outside of the central region",
    ", we detect several new objects .",
    "of the new objects , s1 - 76 , s1 - 82 , and n1 - 84 are well detected , with @xmath20 of 9.3 , 8.4 , and 4.8 respectively .",
    "these objects are all brighter than 10@xmath9 ; therefore their non - detection in the rosat surveys ( which reached 5@xmath810@xmath11  ) indicates that they could be variable on timescales as long as a decade .",
    "while we do not detect variability in these four sources between the individual hrc - i snapshots , the counting rates are low enough that variations of a factor of two may be undetected .",
    "in addition , there are several new sources that varied significantly during our survey . among these variable sources",
    "are s1 - 79 , which is a strong transient with a peak luminosity of 1.5@xmath810@xmath31  and peak @xmath20 of 35 , and s1 - 1 , which is variable on year long timescales with a @xmath32 test for a steady source giving @xmath22 of 1.4 ( probability = 13% ) .      by combining the data from our fields",
    ", we were able to construct lightcurves covering more than 2 years for all of the objects we detected .",
    "initial lightcurves for the objects were measured using the ciao task _ lightcurve _ , which measures the number of counts in a square aperture around the detected object in each epoch .",
    "we measured source fluxes in each of the 17 epochs detailed in column 3 of table  [ obslist ] .",
    "the lightcurves were measured using boxes with 0.7@xmath18 sides within 3@xmath18 of the nucleus where the sources are separated by only 1@xmath18 . this box size",
    "was increased to 2@xmath18 in the central 1@xmath19 , where the sources are generally separated by more than 2@xmath18 .",
    "the box size was increased to 8@xmath18 in the central 18@xmath19 @xmath8 18@xmath19 ( outside of the central 1@xmath19 ) , where the sources are generally separated by more than 8@xmath18 . outside of this region ,",
    "the sources are generally separated by over an arcminute . because these sources are typically located farther off - axis , where the psf is larger",
    ", we used a 16@xmath18 box to measure them .",
    "the average radius of a circle that encloses 90% of the energy at 1.49 kev in the hrc - i is 1@xmath18 at 1@xmath19 off - axis , 4@xmath18 at 6@xmath19 off - axis , and 8@xmath18 at 8@xmath19 off - axis .",
    "these box sizes therefore insured that we measured most of the source counts in off - axis areas where crowding of the sources was not an issue .",
    "the 8@xmath18 box size typically contained only @xmath01 background count per ks timebin , while the 16@xmath18 boxes typically contained @xmath04 background counts per ks timebin .",
    "the background subtracted count rates from _ lightcurve _ were used as a starting point for our lightcurve measurement for each source .",
    "we converted the _ lightcurve _ output from units of counts to flux units using exposure maps which take into account the aspect histograms and instrumental flat field .",
    "as the instrument s effective area depends on the source spectrum , we made the exposure maps assuming a typical m31 source spectrum of an absorbed power law with an index of 1.7 and an absorption column density of @xmath33 @xmath25 .",
    "these maps were created for each epoch of the lightcurve to measure the effective exposure for each object in each epoch individually .",
    "the _ lightcurve _",
    "output was then converted to flux units using the effective exposure of each object in each observation .",
    "finally , the fluxes were multiplied by our conversion factor of 2.5 @xmath8 10@xmath26 erg cm@xmath10 ct@xmath28 to estimate the source luminosity .",
    "table  [ slist ] lists the @xmath22 fit of each lightcurve to a constant flux at its mean value .",
    "the objects have a wide range of variability .",
    "sources with @xmath22 values of greater than 1.47 are discussed as variables in  3.2 .",
    "several of those with the highest @xmath22 values ( @xmath3410 ) are transients , discussed in detail in  3.2 and  6 .",
    "the 2@xmath18 box size used for the central arcmin of m31 was appropriate for measuring the lightcurves for all of the central sources except for the well - known 3 bright sources in the nucleus of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "our _ wavdetect _ analysis detected these sources as the single ( extended ) source r1 - 9 .",
    "the lightcurve of these three sources blended together is shown in the top panel of figure  [ nucleus ] .",
    "the combined lightcurve reveals variability of the nuclear region by a factor of @xmath010 on timescales of about 6 months .",
    "we attempted to create 3 separate lightcurves for the 3 known objects by dividing the blended nuclear region into 3 parts .",
    "we made lightcurves for each of these parts using a boxsize of 0.7@xmath18 .",
    "while the northernmost of these three is closest to the nucleus @xcite , it is unclear if the source is associated with the central massive black hole .",
    "the 3 lightcurves are shown in figure  [ nucleus ] , but the lightcurves appear to be influenced by one another , revealing the spatial limitations of our data set .",
    "even so , we see that the part closest to the nucleus , corresponding to cxom31  j004244.3 + 411608 , shows the least variability .",
    "it appears as constant and faint throughout the observations .",
    "the highest level of variability among the three central sources is shown by the bright , soft source immediately to the south ( cxom31  j004244.3 + 411607 ) which was initially ( and incorrectly ) associated with the central black hole @xcite .",
    "the lightcurve of the source furthest to the south ( cxom31 j004244.3 + 411605 ) shows less variability but mirrors that of its neighbor to the north , suggesting that the two are not completely resolved .",
    "in addition to looking for long - term variability in the nuclear region , we were also able to look for short - term variability using the long exposure of @xcite , where 3 sources are clearly resolved .",
    "the lightcurves of the three objects showed no variability on this timescale .",
    "they all had @xmath22 values of less than 1 when fit to a constant flux , including the soft source which is so highly variable on longer timescales ( @xmath22 = 18.4 ) .    in order to better constrain our lightcurves for the objects in the central region we used the data from @xcite which covers 18@xmath19 @xmath8 18@xmath19 about the center .",
    "this deep observation provided excellent @xmath20 for the november 2001 data points in our lightcurves .",
    "objects near the center of the galaxy therefore show very small errors for their fluxes during that epoch ( cf .",
    "figure  [ vars ] ) .    farther out in the m31 disk ,",
    "the density of bright x - ray sources is small .",
    "this low density of sources allowed larger spatial binning .",
    "this binning was especially useful in the outer parts of the hrc fields because the effective exposure is lower in these outer portions and the _ chandra _ psf is significantly broader on the outskirts of the field . aside from the lower resolution",
    ", the lightcurves were measured the same way as described for the central region .",
    "the lightcurves for the variable objects in our sample are shown in figures  [ vars ] , [ trans ] , [ stars ] , and [ 143148 ] .",
    "these sources will be discussed further in  3.2 and  6 .",
    "in addition to our hrc analysis of the lf and variability of the x - ray sources detected in our survey , we analyzed acis observations of the x - ray transients r2 - 67 and r3 - 16 , the two transients for which we found counterparts in our hst followup data .",
    "we applied two analysis techniques to attempt to recover the spectra of r2 - 67 from the acis observations .",
    "first , we used the pile - up model of @xcite as coded in isis 1.0.50 @xcite , ciao 3.0/sherpa @xcite and xspec v11.2 @xcite .",
    "second , we extracted counts only from the wings of the psf which are not piled - up due to their lower counting rates .",
    "each technique has limitations as described in the appendix .",
    "fitting the spectrum of r3 - 16 was more straight - forward , as it was not piled - up .",
    "the spectrum was only fit using ciao 3.0/sherpa .",
    "in all cases we corrected the instrumental response for the contamination build up on the acis detectors , and we limited our analysis to the 0.30.7  kev range where the background is low and the calibration is secure .",
    "counts were grouped into bins containing @xmath3415 counts to allow standard @xmath22 statistics , and error ranges are 68% as determined from @xmath22 contours .",
    "the details of the fitting procedures are provided in the appendix .",
    "the fitting results of r2 - 67 are discussed in detail in  6.3 , and those of r3 - 16 are discussed in  6.4 .",
    "in order to look for differences between the disk and bulge source populations , we measured the lf of the source population within 5 arcmin of the nucleus ( the bulge ) and outside 7 arcmin of the nucleus ( the disk ) . to facilitate comparisons to previous work ( i.e. , @xcite ) , we excluded gcs from our disk sample , and we generated lfs for the bulge both excluding and including globular clusters within 5 arcmin of the nucleus .",
    "we also provide the globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ; cf .",
    "figure  [ gcdlfs ] ) .",
    "we always excluded 3 sources likely to be foreground stars and 2 sources associated with m32 ( see table  [ slist ] ) .",
    "x - ray fluxes were converted to luminosities using the conversion described in  2.2 .",
    "the differential luminosity functions ( dlfs ) of the disk and bulge ( cf . fig .",
    "[ dlfs ] ) show some interesting differences .",
    "the lfs of the bulge with and without gcs",
    "are statistically equivalent ( cf . table  [ bplfits ] ) .",
    "the difference in completeness between the disk and bulge samples is evident .",
    "the bulge sample contains a large number of sources at @xmath02.5@xmath810@xmath9  , faintward of which the dlf falls off steeply , revealing the depth of the data . in the disk ,",
    "the dlf falls off in a similar fashion at @xmath04@xmath810@xmath9  , reflecting the shallower depth in the disk observations .",
    "this difference in completeness is due to the variable psf of _ chandra _ , which is smaller in the bulge region therefore allowing fainter sources to be detected .",
    "we created @xmath20 histograms for our source list , revealing a peak in the number of sources with 6@xmath14 detections .",
    "we therefore consider our sample complete for detections of 6@xmath14 and higher .",
    "a source near the center of the bulge with a luminosity of 2.5@xmath810@xmath9  will be detected at 6@xmath14 , while a luminosity of @xmath03.5 @xmath35   is required for a 6@xmath14 detection in the disk .",
    "the increase in the _ chandra _ psf with off - axis angle and corresponding drop in sensitivity is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the field - of - view of the observations overlaps at the largest off - axis angles , doubling the exposure time in these regions .",
    "the @xmath36 detection limit is @xmath37   in these high exposure regions , but @xmath38   in nearby non - overlapping areas . in the non - overlapping areas farthest off - axis , the @xmath36 detection limit is @xmath39  . for the remainder of the analysis of the disk lf , we only considered sources with @xmath40  , and for the remainder of the analysis of the bulge lf , we only considered sources with @xmath41  .",
    "interestingly , the lack of disk sources with luminosities @xmath3410@xmath15   is not as pronounced as seen in the xmm survey of the northern disk @xcite . while there is certainly a decrease in the number of bright sources with distance from the center of m31 , our study hints at an additional , more subtle effect .",
    "the southern half of the disk contains a large fraction of the most luminous disk sources .",
    "these sources are shown in figure  [ hlll ] , which shows objects with luminosities @xmath42 as crosses in the right panel , and objects with luminosities @xmath43 as circles in the center panel .",
    "the effect discovered by @xcite is apparent : there are very few bright sources in the northern disk",
    ". however , the same panel shows several bright sources in the southern disk .",
    "there is also a hint of this effect in the data set of @xcite who compared several regions of the disk .",
    "their field 2 , which lies in the southern disk , contains most of the bright sources in their sample as well , but this field was also located closest to the galaxy center . of the 9 bright sources south of 41 degrees declination ,",
    "tests to a steady source find @xmath44 only for 3 of them ; the rest have @xmath45 .",
    "the cumulative luminosity functions ( clfs ) of the disk and bulge are shown in figure  [ clfs ] , and the results of the broken power - law fits are provided in table  [ bplfits ] .",
    "the bulge clf appears qualitatively more complex than that of the disk , but it is adequately fit by a broken power - law with a break at about 7.0@xmath46 @xmath8 10@xmath15 .",
    "this break is higher than the typical values of @xmath02.1@xmath47  seen in previous surveys ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our luminosities are 0.110 kev while the luminosities of those surveys were for narrower energy ranges ( e.g. , 0.37 kev ; @xcite ) ; our wider energy range accounts for only @xmath040% of the discrepancy , assuming a typical spectrum ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xmath25 ) .",
    "our break luminosity is more easily compared to that measured by @xcite which was measured with luminosities of the same energy range by applying the maximum likelihood technique to deeper ( 50 ks ) hrc data .",
    "our clf break measurements agree at the @xmath01@xmath14 level with his measurement of @xmath50 .",
    "our maximum likelihood fit broken power - law has a sharp break , with slope indices of 1.7@xmath50.7 and 0.5@xmath50.2 above and below the break , respectively .",
    "these values for the slopes are also consistent with those measured by @xcite .",
    "the measured values for these parameters were statistically unaffected by the presence of gcs in the sample .",
    "the fit is shown on the clf in the bottom panel of figure  [ clfs ] ; this clf contains no gcs .",
    "monte carlo tests show that 50% of samples taken from such a broken power - law distribution provide better fits than our sample .",
    "the disk sample also shows a possible broken power - law consistent with previous observations @xcite . a maximum likelihood fit to these data gives slopes of 0.6@xmath50.3 below the break and 1.5@xmath50.5 above the break with the break at @xmath5110@xmath15 .",
    "this fit is shown in the top panel of figure  [ clfs ] .",
    "this distribution is comparable to the inner disk sample of @xcite .",
    "monte carlo tests show that 56% of samples taken from such a broken power - law distribution provide better fits than our sample . the best - fit single power law ( cf .",
    "[ clfs ] top panel ; table  [ plfits ] ) has slope 0.9@xmath50.1 .",
    "monte carlo tests show that 71% of samples taken from such a power - law distribution provide a better fit than our sample . while the broken power - law fit is better , both fits are adequate .",
    "our most conservative clf for the disk only includes sources brighter than 1.3@xmath810@xmath15  . above this luminosity ,",
    "the entire region of our survey is complete .",
    "this sample is well - fit by a single power - law with index 1.4@xmath50.2 , also shown in figure  [ clfs ] .",
    "monte carlo tests show that only 7% of samples taken from such a power - law distribution provide a better fit than our sample .",
    "this index is similar to the value of 1.3@xmath50.2 found for the northern disk by @xcite to a faint limit of 10@xmath9 .",
    "the higher break luminosity , and slightly flatter clf below the break of the bulge is consistent with the brightest sources being in the bulge .",
    "the steeper clf in the disk was also seen by @xcite ; however , their sample did not extend more than 9 arcmin from the galaxy center .",
    "in contrast , this disk sample contains sources from 7 to 72 arcmin from the nucleus , showing that the steep clf extends far out into the disk and the bulge contains most of the bright sources .",

    "@xcite found that the clf of ngc 6946 is a well - behaved power - law with slope 0.68@xmath50.03 .",
    "the slope in ngc 6946 is consistent with the recent conclusion by @xcite , from a sample of x - ray point sources in 32 galaxies , that the clfs in late - type spiral galaxies have slopes of 0.50.8 .",
    "a steeper slope is seen in the m31 disk in both the large ( 0.9@xmath50.1 ) and the most conservative ( 1.4@xmath50.2 ) samples .",

    "the lower current star formation rate in the m31 disk may not replenish its short - lived , high - luminosity x - ray sources .",

    "only 0.4% of 10000 monte carlo tests provided a better fit to this slope than our gc sample .",
    "it should be noted that our lfs for m31 could be affected by the long baseline and short exposure times of our data set .",
    "for example , a typical transient is likely to be detected at near its peak luminosity in one ( or a few ) exposures , and undetected in the majority of the remaining exposures .",
    "in the extreme case where it is detected at its peak in a single exposure , and undetected in all other exposures , the mean luminosity ( used in constructing the lf ) is 1/17 of peak . given that the duty cycle of transients is likely @xmath01% , this extreme example overestimates the mean luminosity by a factor of @xmath06 .",

    "on the other hand , there were also 11 counterparts with colors and magnitudes typical of m31 upper main sequence or giant stars ( s1 - 75 , s1 - 78 , s1 - 64 , r3 - 28 , r2 - 8 , r2 - 67 , r3 - 115 , r3 - 16 , r3 - 13 , r3 - 7 , n1 - 81 ) .",

    "x - ray transient sources located in the bulge ( within 7@xmath19 of the nucleus ) are labeled with a ( b ) in table  [ tlist ] .",

    "in addition , with deep hrc imaging taken during the outburst of r2 - 67 , @xcite found no evidence for the existence of x - ray pulsars in the m31 bulge , suggesting it lacks hmxbs .",
    "while the possibility of a high mass secondary in the bulge is low , it is not zero .",
    "the bulge is extremely crowded , and the highest resolution surveys have not covered the entire region or analyzed spectra of all bright blue stars .",
    "in addition , the discovery of molecular clouds @xcite and supernova remnants @xcite in the m31 bulge allow the possibility for some recent star formation .",
    "the lgs optical counterpart candidates for r2 - 8 , r2 - 67 and r3 - 115 have absolute @xmath6 magnitudes ( neglecting absorption ) of m@xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively , consistent with high mass ( e.g. , be binary ) counterparts .",
    "the colors measured for these objects from the ground - based data are not completely reliable , as the @xmath64 and @xmath6 observations were separated by nearly 1 year and be stars are typically variable @xcite .",
    "however , we note that apart from times of major outbursts , the scale of variability is small so that these colors should be reasonable estimates .",
    "in addition , the ground - based data are very crowded in these regions which often causes the optical luminosity to be over - estimated .    within the disk the star formation rate is higher and there are numerous high mass stars , so transients within the disk may have high mass secondaries .",
    "hmxb transients often contain be secondaries and pulsing neutron star primaries @xcite , and are therefore called be transients . only one optical counterpart was found for a disk transient : n1 - 59 in the northern disk .",
    "this source has a very bright optical counterpart candidate , @xmath85 .",
    "if this object is indeed the optical counterpart and the source is in m31 , then m@xmath86 ( or even brighter if we include the likely @xmath01  mag of reddening ) , which makes it at least as bright as an early o star .",

    "the counterpart candidate for n1 - 59 is therefore likely a foreground object .",
    "the relative numbers of x - ray binaries containing black hole vs. neutron star primaries within the m31 bulge may be estimated from the relative numbers of transients vs. persistent sources .",
    "we follow the same argument that has been used to estimate this ratio within the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the argument goes as follows . within the bulge ,",
    "the binary population is dominated by low - mass ( @xmath131 @xmath89 ) systems because the secondaries are old . within the galaxy , persistent lmxbs",
    "are observed to often contain neutron star primaries . on the other hand ,",
    "a large fraction of the transient low - mass systems are observed to contain black hole ( bh ) primaries @xcite .",
    "the duty cycle of these transient black hole x - ray novae ( bhxne ) is believed to be @xmath01% @xcite .",
    "thus the ratio of persistent to transient sources , divided by the duty cycle of the transients , yields an estimate of the ratio of number of neutron star containing lmxbs to the number of black hole containing lmxbs . within the galaxy",
    ", it appears that there are approximately equal numbers of neutron star and black hole containing lmxbs .",
    "this result is surprising , as evolutionary calculations predict that neutron star containing systems should be @xmath0100 times more common than those containing black holes @xcite .    within the bulge of m31",

    "the majority of these are detected in more than one snapshot , and therefore have decay times consistent with bhxne @xcite .",
    "if the duty cycles of the bhxne in m31 are the same as in the galaxy ( and there is no reason to suspect otherwise ) , then the problem observed in the galaxy is also seen in the m31 bulge : the number of black hole containing lmxbs is approximately equal to the number of neutron star containing lmxbs .",

    "the best fit disk parameters were @xmath95  kev and @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the temperature of the inner edge of the accretion disk , @xmath98 is the normalization parameter , @xmath99 is the distance to the source , and @xmath100 is the inclination angle of the disk . assuming a distance of 780 kpc , @xmath98 provides a lower limit to the radius of the inner edge of the accretion disk , @xmath101 km .",
    "these parameters provide a fit with @xmath22 = 1.2 ( probability=0.2 ) . the observed flux is 1.3 @xmath8 10@xmath102 2s ( 0.3 - 7.0 kev ) , and the modeled emitted luminosity is @xmath103 ( 0.3 - 7.0 kev ) .",

    "the observed 0.37.0  kev flux was @xmath109 2s  , and the modeled emitted 0.37.0  kev luminosity at 780  kpc was @xmath110 .",
    "the best fit value of @xmath111 cm@xmath10 is consistent with that due to the galaxy alone , and corresponds to @xmath112 @xcite and @xmath113 for a standard extinction law with r@xmath94 @xcite .",
    "this measurement is consistent with the measurement from obsid 1585 of @xmath114 cm@xmath10 .",

    "we note that the best fit slope is substantially harder than that found when the source was bright ( see appendix for a power - law fit to the bright state data ) .",
    "the harder slope is consistent with the source having entered the ` low - hard ' or ` intermediate ' state from the ` high - soft ' state in obsid  1585 @xcite .",
    "as these transitions are believed to occur at luminosities between 10% and a few % of eddington , this transition is consistent with the source having a mass of @xmath010  .",
    "two hst observations taken @xmath01 month apart , both when the x - ray source was bright , reveal a @xmath2-band source with f336w = 22.3@xmath50.1 mag .",
    "a third observation several months later , when the x - ray source was faint , did not detect the counterpart and set a limit of f336w @xmath75 22.8 mag .",
    "the disappearance of the optical counterpart in concert with the x - ray decline confirms this identification of the optical counterpart of the x - ray transient .",
    "the observations are shown in figures  [ hstims ] and [ 143148 ] and summarized in table  [ r267obs ] .",
    "fortuitously , most of the hst images contained an x - ray bright gc , which we used to register with our _ chandra_-hrc mosaic to the hst images .",
    "x - ray position errors were estimated by dividing the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the x - ray source , as measured with the iraf task _ imexamine _",
    ", by the square - root of the number of counts in the x - ray detection .",
    "the final position errors were dominated by the x - ray position errors ; the optical position errors were always @xmath290.1@xmath18 .",

    "the final hst observation of r2 - 67 was aligned using gc bol 144 .",
    "our _ chandra _ positions of the gc sources had errors of 0.15@xmath18 and 0.08@xmath18 , respectively , and the x - ray position of the r2 - 67 had an error of 0.2@xmath18 .",
    "therefore , in figure  [ hstims ] , the 0.8@xmath18 error circles marked on the first two hst images of r2 - 67 , and the 0.6@xmath18 error circle marked on the third hst image of r2 - 67 , show the 3@xmath14 position errors of our data .",

    "this candidate has @xmath64=22.3@xmath50.3 and @xmath6=21.9@xmath50.1 .",
    "the counterpart for r2 - 67 seen from the ground was particularly unexpected because the @xmath64-band images were taken october 6 , 2000 , when the x - ray source was quiescent , and the @xmath6-band images were taken september 18 , 2001 , a few months before we detected the transient but during a 3 month gap in our x - ray monitoring",
    ". the lgs object may be the counterpart or a chance superposition of a different star along the line of sight , while the @xmath2-band transient seen by hst is clearly the optical glow of the x - ray nova .",
    "the magnitude of the lgs star from the ground is likely a lower limit as crowding often causes the brightness to be overestimated .",
    "the apparently persistent nature of the lgs candidate ( i.e. it was detected when we believe the x - ray source was dim ) and the clear transient nature of the hst counterpart calls into question the validity of the lgs candidate .",
    "however , the lgs candidate is well - detected in the @xmath6-band , with @xmath20 of 9 , but the detection is less robust in the @xmath64-band , with @xmath20 of 4 .",
    "the x - ray source is not a pulsar @xcite and is therefore unlikely to have a high - mass ( be ) companion which would be persistent optically . while the lgs and on - state hst magnitudes are approximately equal to those expected for a slightly evolved @xmath0b3 star in m31 with @xmath117 , such an object would have been detected in all 3 hst observations .",
    "the lgs photometry allows the possibility that this optical detection is an interloping foreground main - sequence star with f336w @xmath3422.8 mag and @xmath118 .",
    "this possibility offers the simplest explanation for the candidate s non - detection in the third hst image .",
    "the detection of this counterpart candidate in the lgs data underscores the confusion that crowding causes in ground - based images of the m31 bulge .",

    "estimates of the x - ray luminosity and the @xmath6-band absolute magnitude are needed .",
    "while the former were directly available from the hrc and acis observations , the latter were estimated from the hst ( f336w ) measurements and corrected for the interstellar absorption to the transient , as estimated from the acis data ( cf .",
    " 6.1 ) and converted to @xmath120 using the correlation between between @xmath121 and @xmath120 ( i.e. , @xcite ) .    plugging the contemporaneous optical and x - ray luminosities into the @xcite relation we can estimate the orbital period of r2 - 67 .",
    "the @xmath122 indicated by combining our x - ray measurements of the absorption toward r2 - 67 ( cf .  6.3.3 ) is @xmath123 .",
    "this @xmath122 implies an absolute m@xmath124 .",
    "we assume an intrinsic @xmath125 , typical for observations for lmxbs in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "these assumptions supply an estimate for m@xmath126 . along with the observed @xmath127",
    ", this m@xmath65 implies an orbital period @xmath128  days .",
    "this is not unreasonable compared to bhxne within the galaxy .",
    "for example v404  cyg has @xmath129  days @xcite , and grs1915 + 105 has @xmath130  days @xcite .      a second way to estimate",
    "the orbital period is from the decay time of the outburst .",
    "@xcite developed a model for the outburst of bhxne disks , assuming that irradiation determines the disk temperature profile during the outburst and that the outburst can not end until the irradiation allows the outer edge of the disk to cool below the hydrogen recombination temperature .",
    "this model predicts longer decay times for larger disks and approximately linear decay curves for systems with orbital periods longer than @xmath01 day .",
    "shorter orbital period systems are predicted to produce exponential decay curves . while the data herein do not constrain the shape of the lightcurve ( cf .",
    "[ 143148 ] ) , they do provide a decay time estimate of @xmath00.2  yr .",
    "equation 23 of @xcite describes the time variable mass transfer rate for such a large disk in outburst . assuming @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the central accretion rate and @xmath133 is the accretion efficiency ( @xmath00.1 ) allows us to re - write this as @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the disk - averaged kinetic viscosity , the constant @xmath136 ( cgs units ) , @xmath137 is the mass of the hot zone and @xmath138 is the time in seconds after the start of the outburst decay .    applying our observation that @xmath127 when @xmath139 to equation ( 1 ) allows us to write @xmath140 using the value in equation ( 2 ) as the first term in equation ( 1 ) , applying our observation of the decay time of @xmath141  years , and assuming that the luminosity is @xmath00 at this point ( justified since it is @xmath142 at @xmath143 years ) lets us write @xmath144    equation ( 3 ) lets us determine the viscosity , @xmath145 cm@xmath10 s , a value characteristic of the large disk implied by the @xmath146 day period .",
    "the @xcite alpha - prescription states that @xmath147 where @xmath61 is the angular momentum transport efficiency and @xmath148 is the disk thickness . in the thin disk approximation , @xmath149 ( see @xcite , p. 74 ) . assuming @xmath150 , the outer disk radius , where the disk cools below the ionization temperature , has the value of @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the bh mass in 10 @xmath89 units , and @xmath153 is the local disk temperature in units of @xmath154 k. this is consistent with the binary separation , @xmath155 calculated from the @xmath146  day period with kepler s law .",
    "the similarity of these values suggests that , in addition to the @xmath156 ratio , the outburst decay time is also consistent with that of a bhxn with a @xmath146  day orbital period .",

    "the second and third hst observations of source r3 - 16 were aligned with our x - ray mosaic using the gc bol 148 .",
    "the error on the x - ray position of r3 - 16 was 0.4@xmath18 , and that of bol 148 was 0.15@xmath18 .",

    "the first hst observation of r3 - 16 did not contain any x - ray bright gc sources . for this observation",
    ", we had to rely on the original coordinate system assigned by the hst pipeline for our alignment .",
    "we added 1@xmath18 to the radius of our error circle in this case to account for uncertainty in the registration between the _ chandra _ and hst coordinates .",

    "the object was classified as an emission line object of unknown nature by @xcite . however , the x - ray spectrum and optical size of the object provide some new hints about its nature .",
    "we extracted the spectrum from a january 8 , 2002 acis observation ( obsid 2897 ) and found that it is well fit with an absorbed power - law with @xmath121 = 1.8@xmath50.8 @xmath8 10@xmath158 @xmath25 and slope @xmath159 ( @xmath160 , probability = 74% ) .",

    "the discrepancies between the implied sizes of the object in ground - based and hst images are difficult to reconcile .",
    "the larger size , like the brighter magnitude , measured in the ground - based images may be due to crowding in the m31 bulge . in any case , the object is not likely to be a single star , though it may be a blended foreground binary with a separation of @xmath130.01 pc .",
    "the x - ray spectrum , optical size , brightness , variability and emission line properties of r3 - 16 allow the possibility that it is a background active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "such agn have been seen through several other local group galaxies at optical magnitudes similar to those measured for r3 - 16 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this possibility is also consistent with the measured @xmath121 which is higher than the galactic value to m31 of @xmath165 @xmath25 , as the light of a background agn would be heavily absorbed by m31 . the increase in apparent angular size with increasing pixel size",
    "would then be a result of integrating more diffuse emission in the larger pixels .",
    "alternatively , r3 - 16 could be a cv at a distance of @xmath131  kpc .",
    "this possibility is consistent with the optical brightness and colors .",
    "the x - ray luminosity would then be @xmath1310@xmath166 during the outburst , and @xmath1310@xmath167 during quiescence .",
    "this range is typical of that seen in cvs ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath00.3 mag drop in the @xmath2-band along with the drop in the x - ray flux does not argue for nor against the cv hypothesis , as the expected relation between this relatively small ( for a cv outburst ) @xmath2-band change and the x - ray flux is unclear . the acis spectrum measured during outburst is harder than that typically seen in cvs in outburst @xcite , but there are some cvs which show hard spectra during outburst @xcite .",
    "the acis spectrum also shows absorption above the value expected from the galaxy alone , which may be somewhat unusual but not unheard of for cvs .",
    "the 1  kpc distance should be taken as an upper limit because , at the galactic latitude of m31 ( @xmath168 ) , an object at that distance would be 360  pc below the galactic plane , which is at the extreme range for cvs ( @xcite , section 9.5 ) .",
    "if r3 - 16 is a cv , the extended , persistent optical emission could be a nova shell from an earlier ( unseen ) nova eruption of this cv .",
    "similar to the images of r3 - 16 , many nova remnants are only slightly extended in ground - based and hst images @xcite .",
    "a high quality optical spectrum could uncover the true nature of this source .",
    "we have combined 17 epochs of snapshot observations covering most of the m31 disk with the _ chandra_-hrc .",
    "these data have provided detections of 166 discrete x - ray sources .",
    "all but 7 of these have been previously detected .",
    "comparison of the lf of the bulge sources to that of the disk sources reveals significant differences in shape .",
    "the slope of the disk lf is comparable to that of elliptical galaxies .",
    "this similarity is consistent with the link between star formation rate and lf slope , as the star formation rate in the m31 disk is rather low .",
    "analysis of the spatial distribution of sources shows that most of the brightest sources in the disk lie in the southwestern half of the disk .",
    "we have found candidate counterparts for 55 of the 166 sources at longer wavelengths in previous surveys .",
    "these counterparts come in a variety of types , including snrs , globular clusters , stars and an extended optical source of unknown nature .",
    "fifteen stellar counterpart candidates were detected in recent wide - field m31 data taken by the local group survey @xcite .",
    "counterparts were detected for 2 x - ray transients using data from hst .",
    "analysis of one counterpart ( r2 - 67 ) found it to be an optical transient .",
    "the properties of this system are consistent with a bhxn in m31 .",
    "the ratio of the optical to x - ray flux yields an estimate of the period of this system of @xmath146 days .",
    "this period is consistent with the x - ray decline rate .",
    "the optical properties of the other transient ( r3 - 16 ) are difficult to understand , but it may be a foreground blend , a cv with an associated nova remnant , or a background agn .",
    "the long - term lightcurves of these sources suggest that at least 44 of them varied significantly over the course of these observations , which cover a baseline of about 2.5 years . from the lightcurves , we have selected 17 good transient candidates , and we have determined that at any given time there are 2@xmath51 active x - ray transients in m31 .",
    "the frequency of occurrence for these bright transient events suggests that @xmath131% of the bright x - ray sources in the m31 bulge are new transients .",
    "if these sources are black hole containing lmxbs with duty cycles of @xmath01% , the ratio of black hole to neutron star primaries in lmxbs in m31 is @xmath01 , comparable to the ratio seen in the galaxy but greater than expectations from evolutionary calculations .    finally , it is unfortunate that we have been unsuccessful at finding counterparts for more than 100 sources .",
    "many of these counterparts are located in the extremely crowded bulge and will require very high angular resolution optical data to recover .",
    "these objects are likely to be faint in the optical ( v@xmath3420 ) , and they may be heavily absorbed . currently undetected counterparts in the disk are likely even fainter or heavily absorbed .",
    "spectral x - ray data of the disk , unavailable with the hrc data , will help to discern whether intrinsic faintness or absorption are the cause for the lack of detection of counterparts at longer wavelengths .",
