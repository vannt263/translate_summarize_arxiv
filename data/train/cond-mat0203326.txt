    "the renormalization group ( rg ) approach of wilson  @xcite provided a framework in which to understand the behavior of various phases of thermodynamic systems in terms of trajectories and rg flows in hamiltonian space . in addition , it provided a scheme , to calculate , in principle , the behavior in the vicinity of critical and fixed points , by linearizing the flow equations .",
    "the method has proved to be powerful in providing an understanding of uniform ( translationally invariant ) systems , an exact implementation of the wilson method in systems with quenched random disorder has been relatively restricted .",
    "thus , for example , while the method has been successfully applied to the anderson localization problem in ( @xmath0 ) dimensions ,  @xcite generalization to include electron - electron interactions  @xcite have had limited success , because of the complications such as the existence of local moments  @xcite which are left out in such long - wavelength approaches to the problem .",
    "another class of problems where a large amount of work has been done  @xcite is based on the random antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin-1/2 chain in one dimension , where it has been shown  @xcite that a perturbative real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) scheme becomes asymptotically exact , as has been explicitly verified in a number of cases , such as the random xy chain , where it can be mapped on to a model of free fermions .",
    "@xcite    another issue where less attention has been given , is the range of validity of the asymptotic results of the linearized rg equations . in most models of uniform systems , a few iterations of the rg equations",
    "leads to the vicinity of the appropriate fixed point .",
    "consequently , a study of the rg trajectory from the region in the vicinity of an critical fixed point to a stable fixed point , usually yields a relatively quick crossover behavior .",
    "however , in a study of a three dimensional model related to the 1d random af chain ,  @xcite it was found that the system did not settle down to a fixed - point - like behavior over several orders of magnitude in temperature ; instead there was a slow , logarithmic in temperature , evolution in the behavior .",
    "indeed , it has been claimed recently  @xcite that the true low temperature behavior of the model is likely different .",
    "unfortunately , such a change can not be experimentally investigated , because smaller terms in the full hamiltonian ( such as hyperfine coupling to nuclear spins ) , and dipolar couplings , which have been neglected in the idealized model , will modify the behavior at such ( exponentially low ) temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , it raises the issue that in models with quenched disorder , the true asymptotic fixed point behavior , may not be practically reached , at least in some cases , making  relevant \" ( in the rg sense ) irrelevant in any practical sense .",
    "it is therefore of considerable interest to examine models with quenched disorder where crossovers between short length scale and long length scale behavior can be studied in some detail .",
    "one model , which has received extensive attention in recent years , is the random antiferromagnetic - ferromagnetic ( afm - fm ) spin chain .",
    "@xcite the study of such systems has been motivated by the discovery of novel one - dimensional ( 1d ) random spin systems .",
    "one example of such materials is sr@xmath1cupt@xmath2ir@xmath3o@xmath4 ,  @xcite alloy of the pure compounds sr@xmath1cupto@xmath4 ( antiferromagnet ) and sr@xmath1cuiro@xmath4 ( ferromagnet ) .",
    "such a system is interesting due to the interplay between quantum fluctuations and disorder ; the latter can not be treated as a perturbation , as it is often found to change the low - energy spectra dramatically or even to destabilize the pure phases .",
    "theoretical and numerical methods used to study random antiferromagnetic - ferromagnetic spin chains have been largely inherited from the study of random antiferromagnetic ( afm ) chains ( with afm coupling only ) .",
    "@xcite in particular , the real - space renormalization group ( rsrg ) approach  @xcite revealed a curie - like temperature dependence in the susceptibility of a random afm - fm spin-1/2 chain at low temperatures . in the rsrg picture , the curie behavior occurs because spins correlate , due to the existence of ferromagnetic couplings , to form clusters whose average size and effective spin grow in a random walk fashion at low temperatures .",
    "therefore , the random afm - fm spin-1/2 chain belongs to a different universality class from that of the random afm spin-1/2 chain , whose ground state is known as a random singlet phase , in which singlets can be formed over large distance .",
    "the rsrg results have been supported by various other numerical techniques , such as quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulation  @xcite and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method .",
    "@xcite    in the rsrg method , one decimates the spins that are coupled by the strongest coupling in the system , and renormalizes the couplings among the remaining spins perturbatively . in this procedure",
    "new effective couplings and effective spins may also be generated .",
    "this procedure , which in general lowers the overall energy scale of the problem at hand , is repeated so that excitations at lower and lower energy scales are probed .",
    "its quantitative accuracy relies on the presence of _ strong _ randomness , as in the case of strong randomness the strength of the strongest and typical couplings are well separated , ensuring the accuracy of a perturbative calculation . in real systems , however , the randomness can be very weak , especially when it is not introduced intentionally . in this case",
    "the rsrg is _ not _ expected to be quantitatively reliable in its early stages .",
    "it has been argued@xcite that the strength of disorder grows as the energy scale is lowered , thus in the low - energy ( or equivalently , low - temperature ) limit , the rsrg results become correct or even asymptotically exact .",
    "nevertheless in this case one expects the thermodynamic properties of the system to be dominated by the physics of the pure chains at high temperature , and crossover to the randomness dominated regime ( where the rsrg results apply ) at very low temperatures .    in the present work we study the thermodynamic properties of the random afm - fm chain , with mostly uniform fm coupling and a small concentration of ( impurity ) afm bonds , using the modified spin - wave method .",
    "we also compare the results of modified spin - wave method with those of exact diagonalization in small systems to demonstrate the accuracy of the former .",
    "our motivation comes from the following considerations .",
    "first of all , as discussed above , when the concentration of the impurity bonds is small , the randomness is rather weak and the rsrg results are not reliable at high temperatures .",
    "the modified spin - wave method allows us to treat the high and low temperature regimes on equal footing , and in particular , address the crossover between these two regimes .",
    "this makes it possible to compare theory with experiments for the entire temperature range , when the randomness is weak .",
    "secondly , the modified spin - wave method has so far been applied to study pure spin models only .",
    "while very successful in those cases , it has not yet been used to study random spin systems . by working out a number of technical issues that one faces when applying it to random spin problems , and",
    "demonstrate its accuracy in the present problem , we lay the ground for the application of this powerful method to other random spin problems .",
    "thirdly , as discussed in the opening paragraphs , it is of general interest to study models where the short distance ( high temperature ) and long distance ( low temperature ) behavior are controlled by different fixed points in the renormalization group sense , and address the crossover between the two limiting cases quantitatively ; our model is such an example , and we hope our study will stimulate future research on this important issue .",
    "our results are summarized as follows .",
    "we find that the spin susceptibility of our system follows that of a pure ferromagnetic chain at high temperatures , and crosses over to @xmath5 dependence at low temperatures predicted by the rsrg , with a coefficient that agrees with the rsrg result essentially exactly .",
    "we also find that the crossover temperature depends mainly on the impurity bond _ concentration _ , while the width of the crossover depends mainly on the impurity bond _ strength _ ; we determine their dependences semiquantitatively .",
    "we also demonstrate that the results of the modified spin - wave method is asymptotically exact in certain limiting cases , and quite accurate in the entire temperature range by comparing them with exact diagonalization results in the systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : picture ] , we describe the model we study , as well as the qualitative physics expected from the model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we introduce the modified spin - wave theory for the random afm - fm spin chains",
    ". we present the numerical results of the theory in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , with emphasis on the effects impurity bond strength , impurity concentration , as well as finite - size effects of our numerical study on the spin susceptibility .",
    "finally , our results are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "readers interested in the comparison of the modified spin - wave theory to exact diagonalization results will find details in appendix  [ singlesegment ] and [ twosegments ] for simple cases like single ferromagnetic segment and two coupled segments .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian for a random spin-@xmath6 chain @xmath7 where the coupling strength @xmath8 is randomly chosen according to the distribution @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the coupling strengths of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 is the concentration of the antiferromagnetic impurity bonds .",
    "we are primarily interested in the dilute doping regime , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath13 , so that we have long ferromagnetic spin segments , separated by antiferromagnetic bonds .",
    "the number of spins in a spin segment ( @xmath14 ) is random , with an exponential distribution @xmath15 therefore , the average number of spins per segment is @xmath16 . from real space renormalization group studies@xcite",
    ", we understand that a strong antiferromagnetic bond tends to lock the two adjacent spins into a singlet ( which is inert at temperatures of interest ) , and the singlet thereby generates a weaker effective af coupling between the two spins next to the singlet ( see appendix  [ twosegments ] ) . therefore ,",
    "for simplicity , we consider weak antiferromagnetic coupling ( @xmath17 ) only without losing generality",
    ".    the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility @xmath18 per spin is qualitatively known .",
    "we assume the zeeman term @xmath19 and set @xmath20 for simplicity . at high temperatures ( @xmath21 ) , the spins",
    "behave independently .",
    "therefore , we expect an ordinary curie contribution of @xmath22 from each spin . when @xmath23 , the spins within each ferromagnetic segment become correlated .",

    "the factor of @xmath25 is added here due to an extra factor of 2 in the zeeman energy terms in the original paper .",
    "therefore , susceptibility of each segment rises as temperature decreases , crossing over from @xmath26 to @xmath27 . in the case of @xmath28 ,",
    "@xmath18 crosses over back to curie behavior at lower temperatures , when each segment of finite length acts like a block spin with frozen internal excitations .",
    "when @xmath29 drops below the typical spin - wave excitation gap of a typical segment @xmath30 we expect @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the typical length of a ferromagnetic segment . in the thermodynamic limit , we obtain the curie constant for locked block spins to be @xmath33 using segment - size distribution in eq .",
    "[ segmentdist ] . at @xmath34",
    ", we obtain @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 decreases with increasing impurity concentration @xmath12 and is always ( unless @xmath38 , _ i.e. _ in the pure antiferromagnetic case ) greater than the high temperature curie constant ( in eq .",
    "[ hightexpansion ] ) @xmath39 expected at high temperatures .",
    "when the end spins of neighboring segments are coupled with weak antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath11 , the block spins ( originating from the ferromagnetic segments ) interact with weak effective couplings . for two segments with @xmath40 and @xmath41 spins ,",
    "we obtain the effective coupling @xmath42 by projecting the coupling to the block - spin space using wigner - eckart theorem .",
    "not surprisingly , long segments are weakly coupled . in the rsrg",
    "approach,@xcite one starts with two strongly coupled segments and decimates the segments to a @xmath43 spin , and renormalize its couplings with neighboring segments .",
    "the spin - wave excitations within each segment , considered in our modified spin - wave approach , are in general neglected in the rsrg approach , which is , therefore , valid only at low enough temperatures . by including these spin - wave excitations",
    ", we can not only demonstrate that the curie susceptibility ( predicted by rsrg ) in a afm - fm spin-1/2 chain at low temperatures is indeed the result of correlated ferromagnetic segments , but estimate the temperature scale at which the low temperature curie behavior occurs as well .",
    "since the renormalized couplings may become ferromagnetic , clusters start to grow in a random walk fashion as segments couple to neighboring segments as we lower the temperature . as in a typical random walk problem",
    ", we expect the average spin @xmath44 and the average size @xmath45 of such clusters of spins satisfy @xmath46 so that as far as magnetic susceptibility per spin @xmath18 is concerned , the scaling behavior of @xmath47 and @xmath45 cancels , leading to @xmath48 by statistical analysis,@xcite one finds the low - temperature curie constant to be @xmath49 in the large cluster - size limit .",
    "this result coincides with the classical result for the susceptibility per spin at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite compared with eq .",
    "[ independentsegments ] , we find that antiferromagnetic impurity bonds reduce the low - temperature curie constant by @xmath50 on the other hand , for small @xmath12 ( or low concentration of af bonds ) , we have @xmath51 ; this simply reflects the fact that the dominant interaction in the system is ferromagnetic , which enhances spin susceptibility .",
    "thus in the cases we are interested in , we have @xmath52    we should note here that unless @xmath11 is very small , there may not be a temperature range in which @xmath53 ; this is because the neighboring segments can start developing correlations due to @xmath11 _ before _ the intrasegment spin - wave excitations are frozen out by temperature .",
    "we will actually study mostly this case in this work , and focus mainly on the crossover from the pure ferromagnetic chain behavior directly to the asymptotic low temperature behavior with @xmath54 as the curie coefficient .",
    "we do this partly because in real systems @xmath11 is often comparable to @xmath10 , and partly for the sake of simplicity .",
    "our method , however , is capable of handling very small @xmath11 and the regime with @xmath37 being the curie coefficient .",
    "the conventional spin - wave theory gives the exact spin - wave spectra of heisenberg ferromagnets at @xmath55 . at finite temperature",
    "however , the theory leads to difficulty in one - dimensional quantum ferromagnets , the number of spin waves diverges when external magnetic field goes to zero .",
    "this difficulty has its root in the mermin - wagner theorem , which dictates that there can not be long - range order in 1d at finite temperature . by imposing a constraint",
    "that the total magnetization be zero ( thus fulfilling the mermin - wagner theorem ) , takahashi@xcite introduced a chemical potential ( equivalence to a uniform magnetic field ) for the spin waves and successfully obtained the low - temperature properties of the ferromagnets in one dimension , as well as in two dimensions .",
    "the beauty of this modified spin - wave theory is that it gives correct asymptotic thermodynamic behavior at both large and zero temperature limit , as well as fairly accurate crossover behavior at intermediate temperatures .",
    "the modified spin - wave theory have further succeeded in two - dimensional antiferromagnets@xcite and one - dimensional ferrimagnets.@xcite for one - dimensional antiferromagnets , the modified spin - wave theory predicted a gap in the spin - wave spectrum,@xcite consistent with the haldane gap in integer - spin chains.@xcite    in this paper , we extend its applicability to ferromagnetic spin chains with dilute antiferromagnetic impurities . in the dilute impurity limit ,",
    "a spin chain consists of ferromagnetic spin segments , coupled antiferromagnetically .",
    "the application of the modified spin - wave theory to the random antiferromagnetic - ferromagnetic spin chains is , therefore , mainly based on our observation that ferromagnetic spin segments can be well described by the modified spin - wave theory ( see appendix  [ singlesegment ] ) .",
    "we found that , for magnetic susceptibility of a finite spin chain , the modified spin - wave theory gives noticeable difference from the exact diagonalization result only at two temperature crossovers .",
    "the crossover at higher temperatures describes the switching on of the couplings between individual spins , which is of little interest in the competition between different segments . on the other hand , the maximum error of the modified spin - wave theory",
    "is roughly 5% , for a chain of up to 14 spins , near the lower - temperature crossover when the spin chain becomes locked into one block spin . for a finite spin chain ,",
    "the translational symmetry is broken .",
    "therefore , one , in principle , needs to introduce a local chemical potential ( or a local field ) for each spin to ensure the magnetic moment of the spin be zero .",
    "fortunately , we can apply a periodic boundary condition to each ferromagnetic spin segment , so that only one chemical potential is needed throughout the segment .",
    "we emphasize that the use of periodic boundary condition reduces the computational complexity without changing the essential physics .",
    "this is particularly true when we have very dilute impurities so that the average ferromagnetic segment length is large .    for the nearest - neighbor heisenberg hamiltonian , eq .",
    "[ hamiltonian ] , we apply holstein - primakoff transformation @xmath56 _ for segments with odd index @xmath57 _ , and @xmath58 _ for segments with even index @xmath57_. this way , we introduce a distinct species of boson for each segment .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath28 .",
    "such unfortunate situations are , in general , associated with modes of zero energy , which then leads to divergent number of bosons ( or divergent magnetization ) . in the case of a single ferromagnetic chain , takahashi  @xcite introduced a chemical potential ( or a magnetic field ) to overcome the difficulty . in this case , we need to introduce to the hamiltonian a set of @xmath60 local chemical potentials , one for each segment , to find a solution .",
    "these chemical potentials are chosen such that the magnetization of each spin segment ( equivalently , of each spin with periodic boundary condition ) is zero .",
    "these constraints , which have the physical significance of restoring the rotational symmetry , ensure that the number of bosons be finite at finite temperatures .",

    "in the study of the random afm - fm ( nearly ferromagnetic ) spin-1/2 chain , the modified spin - wave theory allows us to obtain the thermodynamic properties over a broad temperature range ( on logarithmic scale ) .",
    "we have studied systems as large as 600 spins , with up to 60 ferromagnetic segments , for temperature ranges of over three orders of magnitude . at very high temperatures ,",
    "the spins are independent ; correlation starts to develop within each ferromagnetic segments as temperature drops , giving rise to characteristics of a pure ferromagnetic chain . at low temperatures ,",
    "the observation of the curie - like behavior reveals the regime where ferromagnetic segments are correlated into clusters , whose size grows with decreasing temperature .",
    "therefore , we can study , fairly systematically , in the modified spin - wave theory the crossover between the high - temperature curie behavior ( independent spins ) and low - temperature curie behavior ( correlated spin segments ) .",
    "system size is important in observing the low - temperature curie behavior , since it determines whether the rsrg scaling regime can be reached .",
    "our study has found that the modified spin - wave theory gives results in accordance with the rsrg argument for chains of several hundred spins ( after averaging over random bond distribution ) .",
    "the study of the effects of impurity bond strength shows that the low - temperature curie regime can be consistently pushed to lower temperatures by decreasing the antiferromagnetic impurity bond strength .    in the dilute doping regime ,",
    "we have studied the effects of impurity concentration on the low - temperature thermodynamics .",
    "the results are again in fairly good agreement with the rsrg prediction .",
    "the exception happens at higher concentration ( @xmath106 ) , where we believe the intrasegment ferromagnetic coupling and the intersegment antiferromagnetic coupling take actions at about the same temperature regime , leading to a mixed behavior which appears to look like a different curie behavior .",
    "further explorations using other methods would be very useful to confirm our explanation .    in our study ,",
    "both weak impurity bonds and low impurity concentration give rise to a wide crossover from the ferromagnetic spin - chain regime to the random spin - chain regime .",
    "although the modified spin - wave theory limits us to only a portion of the whole random spin - chain space , we believe such wide crossover can be generic and it can prevent the real rsrg behavior from being observed at reasonably low temperatures .",
    "in fact , the rsrg study of random spin chains  @xcite has pointed out the possibility of having a crossover region of more than five orders of magnitude before the true rsrg scaling regime can be reached . a quantum monte carlo study of the random afm - fm spin-1/2 chain  @xcite has confirmed that a region of weakly interacting spin segments can exist , whose crossover to the low - temperature scaling regime is marked by a ( somewhat small ) peak in the specific heat .",
    "the main difficulty of directly comparing our results with experiments seem to be that quasi-1d heisenberg ferromagnetic systems are rare since there usually exist interchain couplings which lead to three - dimensional ( 3d ) ordering at low temperatures . for sr@xmath1cuiro@xmath4 ,",
    "long - range ( presumably 3d ) order develops at 20.1 k without signature of 1d magnetism .",
