    "since the densities averaged over the @xmath13 and @xmath71 coordinates do not anymore exhibit a dependence on the transverse @xmath71 coordinate , the resulting resistance formula can not explain the magnetic field dependence ( hall effect ) of the measured resistance .",
    "in contrast , eq.([phsenres ] ) , includes the exact , spatial densities and shows a dependence on the magnetic field not only through transmission probabilities but also due to the magnetic field dependence of the injectivity and emissivity .",
    "we will now illustrate this point by investigating the hall resistance of a one channel wire with an obstacle .",
    "let us consider a scatterer which is connected via ideal leads to two electron reservoirs .",
    "let us assume that in the ideal lead , far away from the scatterer , we have a uniform potential in the longitudinal @xmath13 direction and a parabolic confining potential in the transverse @xmath71 direction , @xmath133 .",
    "furthermore , the lead is threaded by a magnetic field perpendicular to the @xmath114 plane . in the lead",
    "the eigenfunctions of such a system can be written as a product of a plane wave @xmath134 in @xmath13 direction and a transverse wave function @xmath135 .",
    "the transverse wavefunction depends now on the @xmath136 vector of the plane wave in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "that means , that not only different channels , but also incoming and reflected waves in the same channel have different transverse wave functions .",
    "this mechanism leads to a spatial separation of incoming and reflected waves and in a strong magnetic field to the formation of edge channels@xcite .",
    "the hall effect in perfect ballistic wires has been discussed@xcite in connection with the suppression of the hall effect in ballistic crosses@xcite .",
    "this suppression is , however , an effect which depends on the geometry of the cross@xcite . here , the main effect which we investigate arises due to the scatterer in the wire which is taken to have a magnetic field independent transmission probability @xmath137 .    for the case of only one open channel in the lead , the scattering state coming in from contact 1",
    "can be written in the lead connecting the scatterer to contact 1 as @xmath138 here , @xmath139 is the reflection amplitude for reflection from contact 1 into itself , @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the wave vectors for incoming and reflected waves and @xmath142 and @xmath143 are the corresponding transverse wave functions@xcite .",
    "the voltage @xmath101 measured on a point to the left of the scatterer is given by eq .",
    "( [ mu3mess ] ) . using eq .",
    "( [ magscatstate ] ) we find for the densities , @xmath144 here , @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of this formula is hidden in the transverse wavefunctions .    in fig .",
    "[ magdep ] we show the measured four - terminal resistance as a function of the ratio @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath3 the magnetic field .",
    "the three curves correspond to three different configurations of the voltage probes , contact 3 and 4 .",
    "the two voltage probes are placed on the two edges of the lead connecting contact one to the scatterer .",
    "first in a way that the @xmath13 position of the two probes is the same ( solid line ) .",
    "second , the @xmath13 coordinate of probe 3 is such that the ldos has a minimum , @xmath149 , at that point in the lead , whereas probe 4 is place on a point where the ldos has a maximum , @xmath150 ( dashed line ) . and finally , probe 4 is placed over a minimum of the ldos and probe 3 is placed over a maximum of the ldos ( dotted line ) .",
    "note , that , if there is no magnetic field present , the resistance is zero , when the positions of the two probes differ only in their @xmath71 coordinate .",
    "if the magnetic field is turned on , a hall - resistance develops which at strong magnetic fields reaches the quantized value @xmath151 . in the case , where the positions of the probes differ in the @xmath13",
    "coordinate in the way described above , a non - vanishing resistance is already measured at zero magnetic field . however ,",
    "when the field is turned on , both curves approach the value @xmath152 . for small magnetic fields",
    ", we can expand the resistance formula , eq .",
    "( [ fournu ] ) , and get to first order in @xmath147 @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath155 . in this formula , the @xmath71 dependent hall resistance and the @xmath13 dependent , longitudinal resistance enter additively .",
    "in this work we described systems consisting of two weakly - coupled multi - probe conductors starting from the global scattering matrix of the whole system which covers all parts including the weakly coupled contact .",
    "we derived a general transmission formula , eq .",
    "( [ tgen ] ) , for transmission through the weak - coupling contact .",
    "we have investigated this formula in the case where there is only one tunneling path . using these expressions we can rewrite formulae , which express the resistance as functions of transmission probabilities , as functions of the local partial density of states .",
    "applying this result the resistance of a one - channel conductor with a barrier shows interesting and surprising features .",
    "our resistance formula can also account for the hall - resistance .",
    "this point is illustrated using two weakly - coupled voltage - probes to measure the magnetic - field dependence of the resistance of a ballistic one - channel conductor with a barrier .",
    "based on the general expression , we can also treat contacts which permit multiple tunneling paths .",
    "after all , even an stm exhibits a current distribution with a certain spatial width@xcite .",
    "it is then interesting to ask what the densities are which are measured by spatially extended tunneling contacts . to our knowledge , a detailed study of extended tunneling contacts has not yet been done .",
    "we have treated the zero - temperature limit . at a non - vanishing temperature",
    "the corresponding results are obtained by multiplying the transmission probability with the fermi function of the injecting reservoir . even in the limit of a single tunneling path",
    "the corresponding resistances will then in general not be independent of the density of states in the tip if this density exhibits a substantial variation at the fermi energy@xcite .",
    "we have already emphasized that the density of states discussed here are quantities which are conjugate to the electrochemical potential of a contact@xcite . at zero temperature",
    "they are evaluated at the fermi energy in the equilibrium potential .",
    "the densities used here are thus essentially chemical quantities and interactions enter only through the equilibrium potential . the interaction induced portion of the density does not enter into the transmission behaviour of a conductor .",
    "this should be contrasted with the notion of tunneling - density of states which are evaluated using the unrestricted green s functions containing the full interaction .",
    "an investigation of this important point is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we refer an interested reader to a discussion of the same issue concerning not density of states but directly the conductance of interacting systems@xcite .",
    "we have discussed examples of voltage and resistance measurements on conductors with a single open channel .",
    "the approach discussed here , however , is also suitable for conductors having several or even a large number of open channels . for a metallic diffusive conductor of length @xmath156 , extending from @xmath157 to @xmath158 , with a local density of states @xmath159 the injectivity can be separated into an ensemble averaged part given by @xmath160 and a fluctuating part .",
    "the average behavior gives us the linear voltage drop and the ohmic length dependence which we expect for such conductors .",
    "more interesting is the investigation of the hall conductance : although the local , ensemble averaged density of states of a metallic conductor is independent of the magnetic field , the injectivities exhibit a linear dependence on the magnetic field and and this gives rise to the hall resistance , similar to the one - dimensional example discussed in section vi .",
