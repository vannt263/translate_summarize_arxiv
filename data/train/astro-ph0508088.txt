    "the detection of the canis major ( cma ) over - density by martin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) produced a renaissance of interest for the third galactic quadrant ( @xmath2 ) of the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "the lively debate in the last year ( momany et al . 2004 , bellazzini et al . 2004 ) on this over - density clearly demands a better picture of the galaxy structure in this region .",
    "+ for the last several years our group has been conducting a systematic homogeneous and accurate ubvri photometric survey of galactic open clusters in this part of the galaxy ( see moitinho ( 2001 ) , giorgi et al .",
    "( 2005 , and references therein ) , carraro et al .",
    "( 2005a , and references therein ) ) with the aim of understanding the detailed structure of the spiral arm pattern in this quadrant .",
    "young open clusters are recognized as ideal spiral arm tracers ( becker & fenkart 1970 , feinstein 1994 ) .",
    "their young ages mean they are near the spiral arm in which they formed and we can obtain precise determinations of their reddening and distance , especially when deep u band photometry - which is very effective in pinning down stars with spectral type earlier than a0 - is available . + surprisingly , the shape and extent of the perseus and cygnus - norma arms in the third quadrant are far from being clear and settled .",
    "russeil ( 2003 ) using star forming complexes finds that both the perseus and norma - cygnus arms are not visible at all in the third quadrant , confirming previous results by may et al .",
    "( 1997 ) who mapped the region with co clouds , and at that time showed a lack of any grand design spiral features in this galaxy location .",
    "nevertheless , they could confirm previous suggestions about the shape and location of the galactic warp and show how bridges of material are present in a few anti - center directions . to date , no published study has probed the spiral structure of the third galactic quadrant using young star clusters .",
    "modern surveys are therefore vital to better trace the spiral pattern in this interesting , but largely overlooked region of the galaxy .",
    "+ in this letter we report on a serendipitous result - namely the detection of a young stellar population behind a few young open clusters - we obtained during the analysis of our large data - set of open clusters .",
    "the ccd ubvri photometry we are here using comes primarily from the third galactic quadrant survey ( @xmath1 , @xmath3 ) described in full detail in moitinho ( 2001 ) .",
    "30 open clusters were observed with the ctio 0.9 m telescope in two runs in 1994 and 1998 .",
    "the data are homogeneous , with color errors of 0.1 mag in all combinations to a typical limiting magnitude of v=21 .",
    "the analysis presented in moitinho ( 2001 ) shows that the ctio photometry is accurate and consistent with other previously published works .",
    "for this reason we consider here the 9 open clusters ngc  2302 , ngc  2383 , ngc  2384 , ngc  2367 , ngc  2362 , ngc  2439 , ngc  2533 , ngc  2432 and ruprecht  55 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "eight of these clusters belong to the ctio survey , whereas ngc  2362 was observed with the 1.5 danish telescope at la silla in 2001 . in all cases the field of view is 13@xmath4 except for ngc2362 , which was surveyed with a mosaic of 5 @xmath5 fields covering 540 arcmin squared .",
    "none of the clusters have been investigated in much detail before , except ngc 2362 studied by moitinho et al .",
    "they found that this cluster is nearby ( 1.5 kpc ) very young ( 5 million years ) and exhibits a prominent pre- main sequence ( ms ) population .",
    "in fig .  1 we show the two color diagrams ( tcds ) and color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of four open clusters : ngc  2302 , ngc  2362 , ngc  2409 and ngc  2453 .",
    "we are going to use the first three as templates in this work .",
    "the data we show in the plots have been selected according to photometric errors , and in particular only the stars having @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 simultaneously @xmath9 are shown .",
    "although some data are available for these clusters , we remark this is the first time deep and accurate ccd multiband photometry has been obtained and analyzed .",
    "the full detailed analysis of these data will be presented in forthcoming papers .",
    "+ briefly , we follow the zero age main sequence ( zams ) fitting method to derive reddenings , distances and ages of stellar sequences in photometric diagrams .",
    "the tcds allow us to infer the reddenings and the spectral types of early type stars .",
    "the cmds are then used to derive each cluster s distance modulus and absolute distance .",
    "finally , the age is derived from the luminosity of the earliest spectral type star still on the ms .",
    "the fits were performed using the empirical solar metallicity zero age main sequence ( zams ) from schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) .",
    "the empirical zams does not suffer from the many uncertainties affecting theoretical isochrones , and possible uncertainties due to chemical abundance are negligible in early spectral type stars .",
    "the fits were done by eye , yielding estimates of reddenings , distances and ages and of their uncertainties .",
    "this is quite a solid method , traditionally used in studies of young star clusters .",
    "see for reference moffat ( 1971 ) , vogt & moffat ( 1972 ) , fitzgerald & moffat ( 1980 ) or , more recently , baume et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "a careful inspection of all the photometric diagrams reveals common signatures . in particular , the presence of three distinct populations :    * the _ clusters population _ revealed by the upper , bluer main sequences ( ms ) .",
    "these mss are fitted in each case with the schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) zams properly shifted following a normal reddening law , which we know to hold in this direction of the galaxy ( moitinho 2001 ) .",
    "these fits are indicated in all diagrams as dotted lines . * a _ fainter and more reddened young population _ indicated by filled squares in the ngc  2302 diagrams .",
    "we are going to refer to this population as the blue plume ( bp ) .",
    "the zams fits to the bp are indicated in all the diagrams with solid lines . *",
    "the _ galactic disk field population_.    the zams fit allows us to obtain the basic parameters for the clusters and the bps .",
    "the results are summarized in table  1 , which lists for all the clusters their galactic coordinates , reddening estimates ( column 4 ) for the whole line of sight from firb maps of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and their reddenings , distances and ages derived from our fitting method ( columns 5 , 6 and 7 ) .",
    "the bp is visible in all the photometric diagrams of all the clusters we mentioned in section  2 . in particular , in the tcds of fig  1 ( upper panels ) it is prominent in the case of ngc 2302 and a bit less detached from the cluster stars in ngc 2362 and ngc 2439 .",
    "however all the corresponding cmds ( lower panels of fig  1 ) show the bp presence beyond any doubt . + as a comparison we also show in fig  1 the tcd and cmd of the cluster ngc 2453 ( right panel ) , where the bp is completely absent .",
    "it is remarkable that ngc  2453 ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) does not show this feature .",
    "+ the fit to the bps ( solid lines ) provides us with the parameters for this population in different galactic directions ( see columns 8 , 9 and 10 in table  1 ) . in particular , we notice that the inferred helio - centric distances are always greater than 6 kpc , indicating that this population is placed in the outskirts of the galaxy .",
    "+ on the other hand , the spectral types of the bp stars ( in all the diagrams ) go from b3-b5 to late a and f , suggesting that this population is actually young ( ages lower than 100 myr ) .",
    "in fig .  2 and 3 we plot the location of the studied clusters ( the 3 templates plus other 6 clusters , see table  1 ) with open squares and their bps with solid triangles in the x - y and x - z planes .",
    "+ we adopt filled circles to place six more clusters which are believed to be associated to cma , or which lie in the same region .",
    "they are one globular and two old open clusters ( ngc  2298 , tombaugh  2 and am-2 ) taken from frinchaboy et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and three other old open clusters ( berkeley 25 , 73 and 75 ) taken from carraro et al ( 2005a ) .",
    "+ to facilitate the interpretation we also include the distribution of co clouds from the recent study by may et al .",
    "( 2005 ) depicted as open circles .",
    "in this study , the authors provide the result of a new large survey of co clouds in the third galactic quadrant with high quality data taken at the nanten telescope ( chile ) , showing that they trace very well the expected position of the norma - cygnus spiral arm .",
    "+ many of these clouds harbor iras sources ( bronfman et al . 2005 ) , suggesting that star formation is still on going at their location .",
    "it seems therefore that the existence of the norma - cygnus arm ( often referred to as the outer arm ) in the third galactic quadrant , previously not very clear , is a reality .",
    "moreover , the spiral arm extension is mostly detected low in the galactic plane at @xmath12 ( may et al .",
    "1997 , 2005 ) , being this a clear effect of the galactic warp .",
    "+ the bp population of 6 out of 9 clusters closely follow distance , longitude and latitude of the outer spiral arm in both the projections . the three clusters which deviate are ngc  2432 , ngc  2533 and ruprecht  55 , which lie above the galactic plane ( see fig .  3 ) , are closer to the sun , and follow the expected extension of the perseus arm in the third galactic quadrant ( russeil 2003 , may et al .",
    "1997 , 2005 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the bp is seen with the same age and shape in all the cluster fields irrespective of their position .",
    "it seems clear that the bp is a possible spiral arm indicator .",
    "+ very interestingly , the bp we find appears also in the field of ngc  2477 ( momany et al .",
    "2001 ) , tombaugh  1 ( carraro & patat 1996 ) and berkeley  33 ( carraro et al .",
    "2005b ) , 3 negative latitude open clusters ( see table  1 ) , and it is currently suggested to be an intermediate - age ( @xmath0 1 - 2 gyr ) population associated with the cma over - density , or the last burst of star formation experienced by this _",
    "galaxy_. + we estimated age and distance of the bp in these 3 clusters ( see table  1 ) , and plot its position in figs .  2 and 3 with starred symbols .",
    "the bp population in all these three clusters was found to be young and to lie in the outer arm .",
    "+ our findings support the idea that the bp in the cma ( plotted with a large filled square ) direction is a young population mostly associated with the norma - cygnus arm , since it is much younger than suggested before , more distant and situated in an area encompassing a significant sector ( more than 40@xmath13 in longitude ) of the third quadrant , where the arm is expected to lie .",
    "+ along this vein , an interesting consideration comes from the inspection of the cmd of ngc  2168 ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) by kalirai et al .",
    "( 2003 , fig.1 ) .",
    "this cluster shows the bp , and the same ms as in ngc  2477 , the f - xmm field shown in bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and the martinz - delgado et al .",
    "( 2005 ) deep cmd .",
    "now , the cma stream at the position of ngc  2168 is far more distant and at a different latitude .",
    "we fitted an empirical zams to the publicly available data , and find that the bp in ngc  2168 , with a distance of 6.4@xmath160.5 kpc , belongs to the norma - cygnus arm .",
    "+ we also show ( fig .",
    "1 ) that ngc 2453 does not show the bp .",
    "in fact , most of the clusters in our sample from this region of the galaxy do not show the bp .",
    "this is remarkable , and means that the bp is not ubiquitous toward cma area , as we would expect for a young population associated to a galaxy , but it closely follows the structure of the perseus and norma - cygnus spiral arms in the third galactic quadrant .      as a final note , we surely agree that a significant stellar concentration is visible in the cmd of ngc  2362 ( see fig  1 ) at v@xmath1719 , remarkably similar to that seen in ngc  2477 , in the f - xmm field by bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and in the deep cmd by martinz - delgado et al.(2005 ) .",
    "this population lies between the cluster and its bp , so in the inter - arm zone , since it is the same population ascribed to cma , which lies at 8.5 kpc from the sun . by looking carefully at ngc  2362 cmd",
    ", we can notice 4 populations :            now , the extension of the cma over - density is estimated to be around @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and to have a line - of - sight depth of about 1 kpc ( martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2005 ) , which is more or less the inter - arm separation between perseus and norma - cygnus at these longitudes ( russeil 2003 ) .",
    "+ intermediate - age and old stars are expected to populate the inter - arm region and both in our galaxy and in external ones bridges of matter connecting spiral arms are not rare . the local arm , containing the sun is a nice example . may et al .",
    "( 1997 ) actually show at @xmath25 a clear bridge of material extending for more than 6 kpc , exactly toward the cma over - density direction .",
    "+ we acknowledge very interesting discussions with jorge may and leonardo bronfman at universidad de chile , and thanks them very much for providing us with the results of their work before publication .",
