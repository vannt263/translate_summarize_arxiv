    "the well - studied family of @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians @xcite @xmath10 is a continuous complex deformation in the parameter @xmath2 of the conventional harmonic - oscillator hamiltonian @xmath11 . at @xmath3",

    "as @xmath2 decreases from 0 to @xmath6 , the eigenvalues sequentially become pairwise degenerate and enter the complex plane as complex - conjugate pairs . as @xmath2 continues to decrease ,",

    "eventually , only one real eigenvalue remains when @xmath2 is less than about @xmath16 , and as @xmath2 approaches @xmath6 from above , this eigenvalue becomes infinite . ]",
    "the parametric region @xmath4 is called the _ region of unbroken @xmath0 symmetry _ because all of the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian are simultaneously eigenstates of @xmath0 ; the parametric region @xmath5 is called the _ region of broken @xmath0 symmetry _ because the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian are not all eigenstates of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a phase transition at @xmath3 separates the regions of unbroken and broken symmetry .",
    "parametric families of @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians typically exhibit a phase transition with entirely real eigenvalues on one side and complex eigenvalues on the other .",
    "the @xmath0 phase transition has been observed repeatedly in laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to report our observation that the qualitative features of the eigenvalues of @xmath12 in ( [ e1 ] ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , are generic ; that is , the same qualitative behavior is displayed by the general family of hamiltonians @xmath17 for which @xmath12 in ( [ e1 ] ) is just @xmath18 .",
    "for example , when @xmath19 , the time - independent eigenvalue problem @xmath20 in coordinate space becomes the _ fourth - order _ differential equation @xmath21 to determine the boundary conditions on @xmath22 , we begin with the requirement that @xmath22 vanish exponentially fast as @xmath23 on the real-@xmath24 axis when @xmath3 , so the eigenvalues are the same as those of the conventionally hermitian quartic - anharmonic - oscillator hamiltonian @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "then , this eigenvalue problem is extended into the complex domain by allowing the parameter @xmath2 to range continuously from @xmath6 to @xmath26 . as we explain in sec .

    "[ s3 ] we study the complex classical trajectories associated with the hamiltonians @xmath18 , @xmath28 , and @xmath35 for a variety of values of @xmath2 .",
    "these trajectories demonstrate some qualitative differences between these hamiltonians . finally , in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] we make some brief concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we explain the techniques for calculating the eigenvalues that are graphed in figs .",
    "[ f1][f3 ] .",
    "we begin by reviewing the procedure for finding the eigenvalues of @xmath18 .",
    "the properties of the eigenvalues of @xmath18 were first elucidated in ref .",
    "@xcite . for completeness",
    "we give a brief review of the techniques that were used to construct an accurate plot of the eigenvalues .    the eigenvalue equation ( the time - independent schrdinger equation ) for @xmath18",
    "reads @xmath37 this differential equation has many different sets of eigenvalues , which are distinguished by the boundary conditions imposed on the eigenfunctions .",
    "thus , it is crucial to identify the specific boundary conditions on the eigenfunctions @xmath22 that give rise to the eigenvalues plotted in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .",
    "wkb theory can be used to obtain the possible asymptotic behaviors of @xmath22 for large @xmath38 : @xmath39 where we have used @xmath40 . since",
    "( [ e5 ] ) is a second - order differential equation , there are two solutions ; we want the solution that decays exponentially as @xmath23 on the real-@xmath24 axis when @xmath3 .    to understand what happens when @xmath41 , we let @xmath42 and require that as @xmath43 , @xmath44}\\right\\}. \\label{e7}\\ ] ] note that @xmath45 vanishes in a stokes wedge . at the center of the this wedge the phase , which is the expression in square brackets in ( [ e7 ] ) , vanishes .",
    "this gives the angular location of the center of the wedge : @xmath46 we use the notation @xmath47 here to indicate that this is the _",
    "right _ stokes wedge .",
    "there is also a _ left _ stokes wedge , which is the mirror image of the right stokes wedge ; the angle of the center of the left stokes wedge is called @xmath48 .",
    "the mirror for this problem is the imaginary axis ; the imaginary axis serves as the mirror because the hamiltonian @xmath18 is @xmath0 symmetric .",
    "note that @xmath49 at @xmath3 and that @xmath50 as @xmath51 .    the opening angle @xmath52 of the right stokes wedge ( and of the left stokes wedge ) is determined by requiring that the phase in square brackets in ( [ e7 ] ) is @xmath53 .",
    "this gives @xmath54 the opening angles of the stokes wedges shrink to @xmath15 as @xmath51 .",
    "however , as @xmath55 , the opening angles expand to @xmath56 .",
    "thus , since @xmath57 at @xmath7 , we see that the upper edge of the right wedge is at @xmath58 . at this value of @xmath2",
    "the left and right wedges meet and the eigenvalue problem disappears because the integration contour can be deformed to infinity .",
    "this is an intuitive way to understand the rigorous result of herbst that the spectrum becomes null when @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the numerical calculation of the eigenvalues uses the standard _",
    "shooting method_. we integrate numerically with respect to the @xmath59 variable down the centers of the left and right wedges and join the two solutions at the origin .",
    "the differential equation in the right wedge in the @xmath59 variable reads @xmath60 the numerical integration begins at a large value of @xmath59 , say @xmath61 . to determine the appropriate initial conditions at @xmath61",
    ", we use the wkb approximation for large @xmath62 : @xmath63 , \\label{e11}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "we then adjust the constant @xmath64 so that @xmath65 for the eigenvalues shown in fig .  [ f1 ] we choose @xmath66 .",
    "we patch the left and right solutions at the origin as follows : in the left wedge the eigenfunction that vanishes exponentially for large argument @xmath67 is @xmath68 , and in the right wedge the eigenfunction that vanishes exponentially for large @xmath59 is @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are arbitrary constants .",
    "thus , the patching conditions are @xmath72 these are homogeneous linear equations , and thus by cramer s rule the determinant @xmath73 must vanish , where @xmath74    the shooting procedure consists of adjusting the eigenvalue @xmath75 so as to minimize @xmath76 .",
    "this numerical procedure is highly efficient and gives a rapidly convergent sequence of numerical approximations to @xmath75 .",
    "let us consider the fourth - order differential - equation eigenvalue problem in ( [ e3 ] ) . a local analysis of this differential equation for large @xmath38 shows that , apart from multiplicative algebraic corrections , the four possible asymptotic behaviors of @xmath22 are @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "we must exclude two of these four solutions because they grow exponentially when @xmath79 .",
    "we now describe the stokes wedges that are associated with the solutions .",
    "we let @xmath42 , and in the right stokes wedge we set @xmath80 . neglecting for the moment the effect of @xmath81 , the phase angle in ( [ e15 ] ) is @xmath82 .",
    "this angle vanishes at the center of the stokes wedge .",
    "thus , @xmath83 as in the case of @xmath18 , the center of the wedge is located at @xmath49 when @xmath3 , and the center rotates downward ( clockwise ) to @xmath84 as @xmath51 .    as before ,",
    "the opening angle @xmath52 of the stokes wedge is determined by the condition that the phase has the value @xmath53 .",
    "this gives @xmath85 thus , the opening angle is @xmath86 at @xmath3 and the opening angle vanishes as @xmath51 .",
    "we now observe one of the universal features of the hamiltonians in ( [ e2 ] ) . at @xmath7 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "thus , the upper edge of the right wedge is at @xmath58 .",
    "by @xmath0 symmetry , there is a left wedge ( a mirror reflection of the right wedge ) in the left - half plane .",
    "the center of the left wedge is at the angle @xmath89 .",
    "hence , when @xmath7 , the left and the right wedges touch , the eigenvalue problem collapses , and the spectrum becomes null .",
    "( this is the generalization of the effect that herbst found for the hamiltonian @xmath90 @xcite . )",
    "this collapse of the eigenvalue problem is a universal phenomenon and always occurs at @xmath7 for all hamiltonians in ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "we now explain the numerical procedure for finding the eigenvalues in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] . in the right wedge",
    "we substitute @xmath91 in the differential equation ( [ e3 ] ) and obtain @xmath92 there are two solutions that grow exponentially with @xmath59 and two solutions that vanish exponentially with @xmath59 .    until now",
    ", @xmath81 has not played any part in the analysis .",
    "however , it plays a crucial role in determining the boundary conditions .",
    "we integrate numerically downward in @xmath59 from a large value of @xmath61 . to fix the initial conditions we use the wkb approximation for fourth - order differential equations @xcite",

    "we choose the constant @xmath64 so that @xmath94 then , using @xmath95 and @xmath96 so that the solution decays exponentially , we take @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the @xmath99th derivative with respect to @xmath59 .",
    "we then choose a large number for @xmath62 , say @xmath66 .",
    "the solution in the left wedge is @xmath100 and the solution in the right wedge is @xmath101    we must now patch the left and right solutions at @xmath102 .",
    "to do so we require that the eigenfunctions @xmath103 and @xmath104 be continuous and have continuous first , second , and third derivatives at @xmath102 .",
    "these four conditions are written as a system of four linear equations for @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 : @xmath109 because these patching conditions are homogeneous equations , they translate via cramer s rule to the condition that the following @xmath110 determinant of the coefficients vanishes : @xmath111    the objective of the numerical shooting procedure is to find the values of @xmath75 that minimize this determinant .      for the eigenvalue problem in ( [ e4 ] )",
    "the possible asymptotic behaviors for large @xmath38 ( excluding algebraic corrections ) are given by @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "there are six solutions , but we seek the three solutions that vanish as @xmath114 .",

    "the opening angle @xmath52 of the wedge is determined by requiring that the phase have the value @xmath53 .",

    "thus , the upper edge of the wedge is at @xmath121 . at this value of @xmath2 ,",
    "the left and right wedges touch and the eigenvalue problem disappears , just as in the case of @xmath18 and @xmath28 .    to find the eigenvalues using the numerical shooting method , we integrate down the center of the left and right wedges and patch the solutions at the origin . in the right wedge",
    "the differential equation in the @xmath59 variable is @xmath122 in each wedge there are three exponentially decaying solutions and three exponentially growing solutions .",
    "we select the decaying solutions by applying the appropriate boundary conditions at a large value of @xmath123 .",
    "to identify the appropriate initial conditions for the numerical integration , we use the wkb approximation for large @xmath62 : @xmath124 , \\label{e30}\\ ] ] where @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",

    "while the eigenvalues of the quantum - mechanical hamiltonians @xmath133 are qualitatively similar , the classical - mechanical trajectories for these hamiltonians exhibit marked differences . using the numerical techniques described in ref .",
