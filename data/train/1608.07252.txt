    "several thousand exoplanets have thus far been discovered using indirect methods , such as transit and radial velocity but very few using direct imaging . to answer questions about habitability of exoplanets , it is essential to utilize direct detection methods in order to be able to conduct spectroscopic studies . with advances in technology , direct detection of exoplanets",
    "is becoming more robust and mature .",
    "high contrast instruments like the gemini planet imager ( gpi ) @xcite and the spectro - polarimetric high - contrast exoplanet research instrument ( sphere ) @xcite , are now able to perform surveys , and have already detected new planets @xcite .",
    "the basic architecture of a high contrast instrument employs extreme adaptive optics ( exao ) to compensate for atmospheric turbulence and coronagraphs to suppress the light coming from the host star .",
    "a potentially significant source of coronagraphic leakage comes from atmospheric refraction once the turbulence has been accounted for , which results in an elongated point spread function ( psf ) that limits the achievable angular resolution and coronagraphic contrast .",
    "this effect can be particularly devastating if the coronagraph operates at a small inner working angle ( iwa ) .",
    "the psf elongation for previous generation high contrast instruments such as the high contrast instrument for the subaru next generation adaptive optics ( hiciao )  @xcite was specified to be @xmath0 of the diffraction - limit ( @xmath1  mas in h - band , residual dispersion goal was 1.33  mas ) : our experiments indicate that this was not achieved in practice ( the measured residual dispersion was @xmath2  mas in h - band ) .",
    "the latest high contrast instrument , the subaru coronagraphic extreme adaptive optics ( scexao ) system @xcite , which is constantly evolving with time by employing the latest technologies , is going a step further in the field of direct imaging .",
    "the science requirement for scexao is a spread in the psf of @xmath3 of the diffraction - limit , which translates to @xmath4  mas in h - band . at this level",
    "the system will no longer be limited by residual atmospheric dispersion , instead the finite stellar angular size will become the dominant term contributing to stellar leakage .",
    "for example , a solar - mass star at 10  pc has an angular size of 1  mas , demonstrating that stars normally considered as unresolved are actually partially resolved and will affect performance at these levels .",
    "the correction of the residual atmospheric dispersion is done using an atmospheric dispersion compensator ( adc ) , which consists of two prisms with similar dispersive properties .",
    "the amount and direction of the compensation are adjusted by rotating the prisms with respect to one another and rotating the entire assembly around the axis of propagation @xcite .",
    "an adc model basically uses the local temperature and pressure to determine the index of refraction of air around the telescope .",
    "it does this at multiple wavelengths to guess the dispersion for different angles at the telescope . to get a correction of 1 mas ( @xmath5  arcsec ) , since the atmospehric dispersion accross visible and ir is about 1  arcsec , one needs to measure the local temperature and pressure to at least a @xmath5 precision . in practice , this precision is never achieved .",
    "so although the model include these parameters precisely , the inputs may not achieve the right precision .",
    "one other term that complicates things is the humidity",
    ". indeed , water vapor changes the index of the air .",
    "the quantity of water vapor is a key factor , as well as the wavelength observed .",
    "this effect can not be taken into account easily .",
    "the problem with the current approach of correction is that it does not make any measurement of the actual dispersion and hence results in imperfect correction .",
    "adaptive optics ( ao ) systems include model based adcs , such as keck ao @xcite and subaru s ao188 @xcite . in this paper , we present the first on - sky measurement and correction of residual atmospheric dispersion . here",
    "we demonstrate that by using a grid of speckles generated by the deformable mirror ( dm ) of the scexao instrument , we can accurately measure the residual atmospheric dispersion and subsequently correct it to @xmath6  mas in h - band . in sec .  2 and 3",
    ", we show the concept and its implementation using simulation , and sec .",
    "4 presents the on - sky results .",
    "light from an astronomical object initially undergoes refraction at the space / atmosphere boundary and then continues to refract as it propagates towards the ground .",
    "this continuous refraction is due to the increasing density and temperature of the atmosphere as one moves to lower altitudes and results in an arc - like trajectory for the light rays as they traverse the atmosphere .",
    "refraction of course , is a function of wavelength and hence a polychromatic psf will look elongated at the focus of a telescope if it is not pointing at zenith . to illustrate this point , fig .",
    "[ f : psf_0 ] shows an example of a simulated psf ( y- to h - band ) for a telescope pointing at zenith with no atmospheric dispersion and compares it to an image using the same conditions , only at a lower elevation of @xmath7 , which results in strong atmospheric dispersion . over a broad bandwidth ( @xmath8  nm or so ) , atmospheric refraction results in an elongation in the psf ,",
    "as shown in the figure  [ f : psf_0 ] ( b ) .",
    "an adc , relying on a model of the atmosphere effectively compensates for most of this refraction , reducing the elongation of this psf .",
    "however , without a direct diagnostic tool , some amount of residual dispersion remains .",
    "one could attempt to diagnose the residual dispersion ( 20 - 100  /nm ) by directly measuring the psf elongation , but this measurement is difficult in practice at the level required by the coronagraph due to residual wavefront error ( @xmath4  mas over the h - band ) . instead of attempting to measure dispersion in the psf core itself , here we suggest using the properties of diffraction features at large separation ( @xmath8  @xmath9 ) whose location is a more sensitive function of the refraction .",
    "figure  [ f : schematic ] presents the rationale behind our approach .",
    "it features a schematic representation of a broad - band psf with conveniently placed symmetric off - axis diffraction features ( speckles ) , and shows how these are affected by the presence of refraction . with no refraction ( corresponding to pointing at zenith )",
    ", the images at all wavelengths will radiate from a point that coincides with the psf core ( cf .",
    "[ f : schematic ] left ) . unlike the core of the psf",
    ", off - axis diffraction features appear spectrally dispersed , with the shortest wavelengths closer to the center of the image ( cf .",
    "[ f : schematic ] ( a ) ) .",
    "when affected by residual differential refraction , the images at different wavelengths no longer radiate from a point coinciding with the psf core ( cf .",
    "[ f : schematic ] ( b ) ) , but from a point that we will call the radiation center , offset from the psf core . by measuring the distance between the radiation center and the psf core , one can directly estimate the amount of residual dispersion .",
    "figure  [ f : vector ] shows a vector based representation of the effect of atmospheric dispersion .",
    "the axes correspond to cartesian coordinates in the image plane . the atmospheric dispersion vector , i.e. the direction in which the psf is elongated , is designated with the symbol @xmath10 in the figure .",
    "the dispersion vectors for the two prisms of the adc are represented by @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "they have equal dispersion magnitudes and add together to generate the total adc vector @xmath13 , which is also dependent on orientation and is given by    @xmath14    if @xmath15 is the dispersion magnitude of each prism , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 their orientation angles , then the two individual prism dispersion vectors are decomposed in the image coordinate system as    @xmath18    the adc provides a maximum dispersion when the two prisms are aligned .",
    "when one prism is rotated 180 degrees relative to the other ( anti - aligned ) , the adc results in zero compensation . for more details of how an adc operates ,",
    "refer to  @xcite .    in the case of an incomplete compensation ,",
    "what is left is the residual atmospheric dispersion vector @xmath19 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : vector ] , given by    @xmath20    the goal is to measure the residual dispersion and offset the adc to minimize the dispersion , in a closed - loop operation .",
    "the steps involve the calibration of the response of the adc prisms ( prism dispersion magnitude @xmath15 ) and the calculation of on - sky dispersion .",
    "if we assume that the adc prism angles are known all the time , then the components in the image coordinate system can be written as    @xmath21    in the same coordinate system , the residual vector can be decomposed into    @xmath22    to calibrate the response of the adc prisms , we assume that , over small timescales , the on - sky dispersion vector @xmath10 is constant . as shown in fig .

    "to test the concepts explained in the previous section , we present the result of simulations that further characterize our approach . as explained by @xcite and @xcite , artificial speckles at specific locations",
    "can deliberately be introduced in an image by a dm featuring a sufficiently large number of actuators , within a finite region called the control region of the dm .",
    "we use this convenient approach to generate symmetric pairs of speckles in the image that will be used to sense the amount of residual refraction in focal plane images .",

    "even with some prior knowledge , the careful mapping of non - symmetric structures is a non trivial task in practice .",

    "* panel ( b ) shows a similar representation for which the psf core has been masked out .",
    "the initial guess is that the psf core corresponds to the radiation center ( i.e. there is no residual dispersion ) .",
    "the original ( blue ) image is then radially stretched from the location of the original psf core by a finite amount ( in red ) .",
    "one can observe that for a sufficiently large stretch factor ( of the order of 20% in practice ) , the spectrally dispersed structures present in both images ( the blue and the red ) no longer overlap .",
    "this difference can be quantified by the norm of the difference between the two images @xmath41 . *",

    "a proper error budget is beyond the scope of this work but with careful consideration we believe the residual dispersion could be further optimized to the desired value of @xmath4  mas .",
    "one approach that could potentially improve the correction could be to exploit incoherent artificial speckles rather than the coherent versions used in this body of work .",

    ", speckles that do not interact with the underlying speckle halo can be created . using these speckles ,",
    "the stability of their brightness and centroid can be improved which would improve the determination of the radiation center .    finally , by using a method which uses the final science image to correct for residual atmospheric dispersion , it is possible to correct for dispersion resulting from optics internal to the instrument .",
    "this term is not taken into account in adc models , and so direct measurement of this effect in the final focal plane is the only solution .",
    "in this work , we demonstrated the first on - sky measurement and correction of residual atmospheric dispersion using an adaptive speckle grid .",
    "this technique can be used by other ao systems , which do not employ high actuator dms to create speckle grids , by using a diffractive grid in the pupil .",
    "this concept will be extended to work in conjunction with coronagraphs , where the location of the psf behind the coronagraph can be found by cross - correlating the speckles in the grid . in this work ,",
    "we have canceled one of the leading noise terms which prevents direct imaging of exoplanets .",
    "this work will be valuable in the field of ground - based high contrast imaging of habitable exoplanets in the era of elts , because it shows the path to correct atmospheric dispersion to the highest degree compared to traditional approaches .",
    "it can also be incorporated in atmospheric dispersion corrector design for elts @xcite .",
