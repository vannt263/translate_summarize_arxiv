    "a gas can be described using a small number of macroscopic variables : temperature ( @xmath0 ) , pressure ( @xmath1 ) , numbers of moles ( @xmath2 ) , volume occupied by a gas ( @xmath3 ) , ect .",
    "+ the most important is the pressure , that represents the total pressure that a state could make on another state , this quantity can be composed of different contribution , e.g. an economical pressure due to an embargo or military pressure due to its nuclear arsenal , etc . +",
    "in order to study equilibrium we propose the following simple model : consider a cylinder , with volume @xmath3 , divided in two parts ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) by an adiabatic ( no heat can be exchanged through the wall ) , free to move and frictionless wall .",
    "now suppose to fill the two volumes with two different gases and to fix the external temperature @xmath0 , then at equilibrium the pressures of two gas must be the same : @xmath6    this is quite good in our context , because an equilibrium can exist if and only if the geopolitical pressure is the same between two different states .",
    "this is the reason why the pressure , in our model , is be the discriminant on the existence of an equilibrium : if a state makes to much ( or too littll ) pressure it would be very hard to reach equilibrium with another state .",
    "+ to determine the pressure that a state is able to do , we use a state equation : a constitutive mathematical relation , that s gives the possibility to estimate one of the parameters if the others are knowns .",
    "+ filling the two volumes with real gases ( i.e. van der waals gases @xcite ) , their pressure is : @xmath7    @xmath8    before looking deeply in equation it is necessary to understand how we associate the parameters that describe a physical gas to a geopolitical context .",
    "* @xmath9 is a physical constant , that represents the nuclear deterrence of a state . +",
    "* @xmath10 is number of moles , it describe the amount of particles in the gas . in the purposed model it represents the capability of a state , an high value of @xmath2 indicates a powerful ( e.g. great gross national product ) state . * @xmath0 is the temperature of the gas and also of the external environment .",
    "physically it describe the average agitation of particles that compose a gas .",
    "pressure is directly proportional to temperature , so a state with high average agitation has more pressure . +",
    "* @xmath11 is the volume occupied by a gas",
    ". we will call it strategic volume . fixed all the other quantities",
    "the volume of a ",
    "gas will represents its relative weight in an equilibrium situation .",
    "e.g. let s suppose that the volume of the cylinder , at equilibrium , is shared in such way that @xmath12 this means that for the equilibrium the state @xmath13 is twice more important that state @xmath14 .",
    "we want emphasize that the relation @xmath15 does not means that state @xmath13 is more powerful than state @xmath14 , but that its role is more crucial for the strategic deterrence equilibrium . *",
    "@xmath16 corresponds to the intrinsic volume of atoms and molecules of the gas .",
    "this term keeps in account low range repulsive forces which oppose to the compression of the gas .",
    "+ in geopolitical analogy it is a critical parameter , because a gas can be compressed until it reaches @xmath17 value , if this occurs it describes a dramatical situation , since not equilibrium can anymore occur .",
    "@xmath16 can represent the * internal instability * of a state .",
    "+ states with high value of @xmath16 are brought more easily to committing unrepairable mistakes , since a lower external pressure can bring this gas near @xmath17 critical value .",
    "* @xmath18 represents a low range attractive force that reduce the pressure of a gas , @xmath18 is positive definite . in geopolitics",
    "the situation is quite different ; we assume that @xmath18 can be both positive or negative .",
    "+ if @xmath19 reduces the pressure of a gas , so positive value of @xmath18 can be interpreted as a * stability factor*. + otherwise if @xmath20 is a * destabilizing factor*.    let s look at equation it is trivial that the pressure is composed by two terms .",
    "+ first term gives high contribution to the geopolitical pressure if we are dealing with a large amount of strategic deterrence weapons ( large n ) or if the temperature is high . in geopolitical analogy",
    "we relate this contribution to the pressure made by the strategic nuclear deterrence of a state , in this case the therm gives a lower contribution if @xmath16 has a big value .",
    "so we can imagine that a state with internal problems is less influent on the balance of deterrence through its strategical weapons .",
    "+ then can be useful to parametrize @xmath16 , as it is possible to distinguish from different contributions to the internal instability of state : @xmath21 every term of the last equation is positive , @xmath22 represents the contribution from * economical * problems , @xmath23 represents the contribution due to * non - state actors * and @xmath24 is the contribution due to * internal political * problems .",
    "+ the behavior of the second term , @xmath25 , depends on the signs of the parameter @xmath18 , as if @xmath20 , it gives a positive contribute to the pressure , otherwise if @xmath26 .",
    "+ hence , as before , let s parametrize @xmath18 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is lesser than zero and represents the * conventional military * contribution , while @xmath29 is bigger than zero and represents * diplomatic actions * that reduce the pressure .",
    "we solved equation respect @xmath4 in different limits to simulate different strategic behaviors .",
    "+ firstly we impose @xmath30 then equilibrium condition becomes : @xmath31 the last equation represents a * strategic equilibrium equation * , since in this case we suppose that only the strategic nuclear weapons influence the equilibrium .",
    "last equation tells us that the ratio between strategic volumes and number of strategic deterrence mechanisms multiplied by the capability , is the same .",
    "the most important conclusion that can be draw is that equilibrium does always occur . indeed",
    "the unique case in which a nuclear war can break out is the one where one of the two state does not have a nuclear strategic weapon .",
    "this is in good approximation with mad theory .",
    "+ the other case that we take in account is the one in which @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "equation becomes : @xmath36 this equation represents a * simplified deterrence and strategic equilibrium * of an asymmetric geopolitical situation .",
    "+ the hypothesis was made to fit a existing situation of equilibrium among india and pakistan .",
    "for sake of relevancy to the real situation , from now we interchange index @xmath13 with index @xmath1 ( since refers to pakistan ) and index @xmath14 with @xmath37 ( refers to india ) .    then imposing @xmath34 and @xmath38",
    "we assume that both states have enough nuclear deterrence to annihilate each other and the state capability it is similar ( not true in reality but the first aim of this work it is tu study the influence of others factors on equilibrium , the study of assymetric nuclear and economical situation will be adress to fututre works ) .",
    "furthermore @xmath39 means there is not a substantial conventional military pressure on india made by pakistan .",
    "+ finally we set @xmath40 , india in this model does not have a critical volume .",
    "this means on one hand that any pressure from pakistan can not convince india to make the first use of a nuclear weapons , on the other hand that india does not have rouge state behaviors or internal economical problems of concern @xcite .",
    "+ we solve this equation with respect to @xmath41 , fixing @xmath42 , @xmath43 , using as parameters , representing the geopolitical situation , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in figure [ 3d ] it is possible to see one solution ( system has two roots , one for our purpose is meaningless ) . + in figure [ vs ] , we can see sections of the previous graph , obtained fixing one parameter .",
    "+ looking at these graphs one should keep in mind that @xmath46 means that in such points of parameters space is not possible to find physical ( e.g. real ) solutions of equation ( [ equilibrium ] ) ( we set @xmath46 in these cases in order to make graph , a priori this situation is the liquefaction of one of the two gases and volume can be a complex number ) .",
    "+ then geopolitically in these points no kind of strategic and deterrence equilibrium can be achieved . + to use this graph one must estimate @xmath44 and @xmath45 of the real situation , then using figure [ 3d ] it is possible to say if with these estimated values there exists a strategic and deterrence equilibrium and how far is this point from the cliff .",
    "+ for example , one looking at the real situation estimates @xmath47 , then figure [ 3d ] shows for which value of @xmath44 there is an equilibrium .",
    "+ in particular let s consider figure [ vs].b where @xmath45 is fixed at @xmath48 , then it is possible says for @xmath49 india s conventional military pressure is too much for the existence of an equilibrium .",
    "otherwise if @xmath50 we have a conventional military pressure from india , by the way equilibrium can occur .",
    "it is important to notice that an @xmath44 decreasing represents the escalation dominance of india , an increase of conventional military power in order to assure a rapid dominance in war scenery . from these results",
    "we can say that escalation dominance could be a threat for equilibrium .",
    "+ eventually for @xmath51 , india tries a diplomatic dtente , for @xmath47 there is always equilibrium . +",
    "another example is figure [ vs].a , in this case suppose , a priori , to estimate @xmath52 , then only if @xmath53 an equilibrium is possible .",
    "+ what further information can be extracted from figure [ 3d ] ? + since @xmath44 can be both positive and negative we can distinguish between two cases .",
    "+ if @xmath54 in this case the term @xmath55 gives a negative contribution to @xmath56 , then this region represents a situation where india tries a diplomatic dtente .",
    "an interesting fact is that also in this case a nuclear war can occur when @xmath45 is large enough .",
    "this means that internal ( economical or political ) instability or the action of non - state actor are sufficient to cause a dramatic situation even thought india s distress actions .",
    "+ if @xmath57 the term @xmath55 gives a positive contribution to @xmath56 .",
    "this behaviour simulates that the conventional military force of india makes some pressure on pakistan .",
    "luckily , also in this case equilibrium can occur , obviously bigger @xmath44 is lesser the value of @xmath45 must be in order to make equilibrium possible . +",
    "then our model shows that the most important issue for reaching a geopolitical stability in south - asia area is the presence of non - state actors or internal instability of a state .",
    "the presence of nuclear powers in the area is not mainly cause of instability and it is not sufficient to be cause of a war .",
    "+ note also that the strategic volume of pakistan is bigger than india s one , this means that the role of pakistan is more important in this situation and the priority should be the `` stabilization '' of pakistan internal politic .",
    "+ these results are important since our model supposes that a state is a unitary actor but shows that factors due to instability or conventional military forces are fundamental to reach an equilibrium , usually this kind of factors are taken away using the unitary actors theory .     in function of @xmath44 and @xmath58 with @xmath59 and total volume @xmath60 .",
    ", width=491 ]     +",
    "as it was said before one aim of this work is to study a geopolitical situation between two states considering also the interference made by other states . + the main advantage in using a thermodynamics toy model is the reservoir .",
    "in fact if we put the system into a reservoir , then the temperature of the system becomes the same temperature of environment , then we are considering a thermal bath .",
    "+ so it is possible to simulate the action of neighbour state as a different temperature . in previous section we set arbitrary @xmath61 ,",
    "that condition will represent a situation where the system ( i.e. the two state ) has a low interaction with other states : the attention of international establishment or of neighbour state is elsewhere ; then we can figure out that a temperature increase represents a political interest on the system from external state actors , this can be a good approximation because before we said that @xmath0 is the average agitation of the components of a gas , then attention of external states can enlarge the worries of the state that compose the system , so this will cause a temperature increase . +",
    "this analogy has advantages and disadvantages , actually it is possible to study a problem that considers more than two states without working with a multi - bodies ( three or more ) problem , but this assumption works if and only if we are dealing with external actors that are not heavily influenced by changes in the system . in other words reservoir does not changes its temperature if there are changes in the system . in geopolitics",
    "this is a good approximation when we suppose that an external actor is very powerful ( economically and military ) in comparison of states in the system .",
    "+ for these reasons in india - pakistan equilibrium can be again a good example to test our model , because the role of reservoir can be made by internatiol soft diplomacy , infact we can say that the international establishment is not affected too much by the situation between india and pakistan . for sake of understanding we set arbitrary @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "+ in figure [ temp ] is possible to see the same figure [ 3d ] , viewed from above , evaluated at different temperatures ( remember that figure [ 3d ] is evaluated at @xmath42 ) .",
    "+ look in particular [ temp](d ) with external high temperature ( @xmath63 ) the model shows a particular behavior .",
    "+ first of all , equilibrium can exist for any value of @xmath44 , from a mathematical point of view , with this temperature , the contribution of the term @xmath64 is small compared to the others ( in both cases , if it is an stabilizing factor or not ) .",
    "+ this fact could mean that if the international establishment gets interested in the area ( then @xmath0 is high ) , then india spreads its energy and loses the interest in making pressure on pakistan with conventional military power .",
    "+ hence this intervention , in our model , reduces the pressure on pakistan .",
    "+ note also that in some points in the plane @xmath65 where at @xmath42 equilibrium solutions do not exists , for high temperatures these points may have solution . for these reasons an international intervention , in this model , is a stabilizing factor .",
    "+ on the other hand , in this case ( @xmath63 ) , there exists a critical value of @xmath45 ( i.e. @xmath66 ) , when @xmath67 equilibrium can not occur independently on any actions . +",
    "this represents that there exists a break point of pakistani problems , if pakistan has too many internal problems ( economical or political ) or too much rouge state behavior a potential war might breaks out , regardless of international peacemaking efforts .",
    "+ in other words , a international strong intervention could dramatically change the scenery , it could make inefficient the effects of india s conventional military pressure on pakistan ( i.e. the equilibrium point exists despite the value of @xmath44 ) , for this reason due to this action it is possible to have some equilibrium points that would not exist otherwise .",
    "however pakistani problems can always be source of instability for all south asia area .",
    "+     in function of @xmath44 , @xmath68 , at different temperature , seen from above . at the first row starting from left we @xmath69 [ k ] and @xmath70 [ k ] , indeed the second row @xmath71 [ k ] and @xmath72 [ k ] .",
    "the brown area are places in parameters space where @xmath46.,width=529 ]",
    "the proposed model through gases enables to simulate different behaviors . in one limit , where no `` weight '' is associated to conventional military power or to internal instability source",
    ", it simulates the mad theory , since no war might break out ( equilibrium always exists ) until both state has a nuclear strategic deterrence .",
    "+ otherwise this model is able to represents an asymmetric situation where one state has a large conventional military power and no internal problem and the other has only internal stability issues and a negligible conventional military compared to the other . in this case using this model to represent the deterrence equilibrium between pakistan and india shows how this asymmetry is source of instability for the whole area .",
    "the model is able to incorporate these factors even if it is based on unitary actors theory , in particular we saw the effect of pakistani non - actor state , india s diplomacy and escalation dominance .",
    "we conclued that the best option for india is the diplomatic one but the key role is adressed to pakistan s internal problem . +   + the last advantage of this model is the possibility to simulate the action of a powerful neighbour state through the temperature of the thermal bath . in this case",
    "we showed that international soft diplomacy intervention could be a strong stabilizing factor for the pakistan - india equilibrium issue , but the key role is again addressed to the pakistani internal problems .",
    "these problems are discriminant for the existence of the equilibrium and could be a source of war even with a strong external intervention , so our idea is that priority should be given to solve pakistani internal problems to reach a long term stability in the south - asia area .",
