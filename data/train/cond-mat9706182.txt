    "physical systems subject to finite time periodic perturbations of amplitude @xmath0 and period @xmath4 have been extensively studied  @xcite by making use of the floquet theorem .",
    "this theorem , a consequence of the discrete time translation symmetry of the hamiltonian , states that there is a complete set of quasiperiodic solutions of the time dependent schrdinger equation which , when @xmath5 , are simply multiplied by a phase factor @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is called the  quasienergy \" . this phase factor defines @xmath7 only modulo @xmath8 , and so the quasienergy may always be taken to lie in the strip @xmath9 .",
    "for such systems the quasienergies @xmath7 are of comparable interest to the energy levels of time independent systems .",
    "one would expect to use the subscripts @xmath10 as unambiguous labels of the time dependent states of a periodically driven system as the magnitude @xmath0 of the perturbation is switched on adiabatically , as in the case of time independent quantum systems .",
    "indeed , there is a substantial literature studying floquet systems along these lines , usually employing numerical methods , in a _",
    "finite _ set of basis states @xcite .",
    "of special interest are the  avoided crossings \" ( ac s )  regions in the @xmath11 plane where two quasienergies approach each other as a function of @xmath0 and ( except for special symmetries ) avoid crossing one another .",
    "but there is a difference in principle when a complete _ infinite _ set of basis states is included . for a spatially confined system , with an infinite number of discrete energy levels for @xmath12 ,",
    "there is also an infinite number of quasienergies for @xmath13 , and the spectrum fills the fundamental strip densely .",
    "in fact , typically it is a dense point spectrum @xcite .",
    "( for example , in the special case of a particle in a one dimensional square well and vanishing @xmath0 , weyl@xcite has shown that the energy eigenvalues fill the fundamental strip densely and uniformly ) . as the number of basis states becomes infinite",
    "there is a weakly avoided crossing ( hereafter  wac \" ) near each point in the @xmath14 strip .",
    "this leads to qualitatively new issues : do the floquet state solutions for a given @xmath0 converge to well defined limits ?",
    "are the floquet states and quasienergies well behaved functions of @xmath0 ? and is there a well defined limiting path which the system follows as @xmath0 is switched on arbitrarily slowly  _",
    "i.e. _ , does an adiabatic limit exist ?",
    "we have examined these questions in a variety of approximate ways and have arrived at a coherent picture , though generally we do not have conclusive mathematical proofs .",
    "we find that the radii of convergence of power series expansions in @xmath0 , starting from the unperturbed eigenstates , are zero .",
    "floquet states and their quasienergies are discontinuous functions of @xmath0 everywhere ; there is no adiabatic limit in the usual sense ( though we will propose a useful weakened modification of the adiabatic theorem ) .",
    "at the same time , in the limit of slow switching on of @xmath0 the quasienergy remains arbitrarily close to its initial ( @xmath12 ) value .",
    "we will explain the consistency of these results with the well established success of standard time dependent perturbation theory and of the adiabatic theorem .",
    "we note that these features will not be seen directly in any numerical study as @xmath1 becomes large .",
    "the effects become increasingly weak very rapidly as the basis size is increased .",
    "although , for a given interval in @xmath0 , inclusion of very high lying levels does have a major impact on floquet states and quasienergies , it is only over an increasingly smaller range of @xmath0 , and this becomes at some stage unobservable on the scale of numerical accuracy available to the computer .    in section",

    "iv we analyze the convergence of the floquet states as the size of the basis becomes infinite .",
    "section v is devoted to the dependence of the states and quasienergies on @xmath0 , including questions of labelling floquet states , and of the existence of an adiabatic limit , when @xmath15 .",
    "the relationship to finite order time dependent perturbation theory is discussed in section vi .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section vii .",
    "in this section we review the elements of time periodic hamiltonian systems , @xmath16 when approximated by a _",
    "finite _ matrix , @xmath17 , in the representation of the @xmath1 lowest states of the time independent hamiltonian @xmath18 . in the next section",
    "we will discuss the considerable problems that occur in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "because of the discrete time translational symmetry of @xmath17 , there is a complete set of solutions @xmath19 of the time dependent schrdinger equation ( with @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 which are of the floquet form , @xmath22 with a time periodic part @xmath23 and  quasienergies \" @xmath24 which may be taken to lie in the interval @xmath25 , with @xmath26 . for given @xmath0",
    "one may label the floquet states in order of increasing quasienergy , the eigenvalue which characterizes discrete time translational symmetry .",
    "figure 1 shows such a quasienergy spectrum ( for finite @xmath1 ) as a function of @xmath0 for the example of a free particle in a one - dimensional box ( @xmath27 $ ] ) with harmonic driving , @xmath28 the quasienergies are continuous functions of @xmath0 that do not cross , but show avoided crossings ( ac s ) provided there are no symmetries which allow actual crossings .",
    "these ac s are abundant in the spectra of time periodic systems and are of central interest in this work . as the basis size",
    "is increased , the newly introduced avoided crossings tend to become rapidly weaker ( smaller gaps at the crossing and smaller range of @xmath0 over which their effects are substantial ) .",
    "they therefore tend to become isolated from one another , and it is useful and meaningful to consider their effects individually , as we do in the following .",
    "as two quasienergy lines pass an isolated weakly avoided crossing ( wac ) at @xmath29 , the corresponding floquet states rapidly interchange their forms . at the point",
    "@xmath29 they are very nearly linear combinations of the two floquet functions just outside the region of the ac , with amplitudes of equal magnitude .",
    "as @xmath30 grows , this mixing decreases rapidly , as follows .",
    "the functions are mixed by no more than a given small relative weight @xmath31 , provided that @xmath32 , where @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the quasienergy splitting at the ac , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the slopes @xmath37 of the quasienergies at the crossing point in the absence of the terms connecting these states ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we neglect the weak influence of all other states near this wac .    using standard floquet state perturbation theory@xcite in @xmath0 ,",
    "one finds that the second order term describes very well the overall behaviour of the quasienergies for small @xmath0 .",
    "however , near @xmath29 nearly degenerate perturbation theory is needed , giving @xmath38 . \\label{degen}\\ ] ]    it is helpful to consider _ complex _ values of @xmath0 .",
    "then the time evolution is no longer unitary , and quasienergies are complex . they may be considered as the @xmath1 values of a single @xmath1-valued analytic function , @xmath39 , with @xmath1 riemann sheets connected at complex branch points@xcite . as is the case for real @xmath0 , the function @xmath39 is defined only modulo @xmath8 , and we choose always @xmath40 . from ( [ degen ] )",
    "we see that wac s for real @xmath0 are manifested as branch points near the real axis of @xmath39 , at @xmath41 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "when @xmath0 passes along the real @xmath0 axis through @xmath42 , as discussed above , there is a rapid change in the spatial part of the two floquet states , which are approximately interchanged . in contrast , on a path starting from the real axis , going in a loop in the complex plane around the branch point ( [ bpoint ] ) and back to the real axis , each of the two floquet states returns approximately to its original spatial dependence .",
    "perturbation expansions in @xmath0 have finite radii of convergence . at @xmath43",
    "the eigenstate @xmath44 with energy @xmath45 defines the quasienergy @xmath46 on the j - th riemann sheet of @xmath39 ( the indices @xmath47 and @xmath48 are unequal , in general , because @xmath48 labels increasing values of @xmath49 in @xmath25 , whereas @xmath47 labels increasing energy values @xmath50 over @xmath51 ) .",
    "then the radius of convergence @xmath52 for @xmath44 and @xmath53 is the magnitude of @xmath0 at the branch point nearest the origin on that j - th sheet .    in the laboratory",
    "the perturbation , @xmath54 , is commonly turned on slowly .",
    "this can be characterized , as usual , by a switching factor @xmath55 in the interaction ( @xmath56 ) : @xmath57 with the initial condition @xmath58 we are interested in the wave function @xmath59 at a specified time , say @xmath60 .",
    "this system is no longer periodic in time , and the solutions of the time dependent schrdinger equation corresponding to ( [ hturnon ] ) and ( [ asympsi ] ) are therefore no longer floquet functions . however , if the turn - on rate @xmath61 is slow compared to the driving frequency @xmath8 , it is useful to describe the solutions at time @xmath62 in the basis of the floquet functions ( [ floquet ] ) at the corresponding value of @xmath63 .",
    "two results are known@xcite :    \\i ) every ac can be characterized by a rate @xmath64 for large turn - on parameters @xmath65 ( provided that @xmath66 ) the solution will follow closely the initial floquet state , as if there were no ac .",
    "this is the so - called @xcite landau - zener transition through the ac . on the other hand , in the adiabatic limit for this",
    "ac , @xmath67 , it will closely follow the floquet state which passes the ac continuously .",
    "for @xmath68 the solution , after @xmath69 has passed @xmath42 , will be a superposition of the two floquet states involved in the ac .",
    "\\ii ) the adiabatic theorem : apart from an overall phase factor , the final state @xmath70 converges in the limit @xmath71 , and the limit is the floquet state of the periodic system that corresponds to the quasienergy found by following the quasienergy @xmath53 of the initial state @xmath44 as a _ continuous _ function of @xmath0 .",
    "these properties are well established for floquet systems with a finite basis . in the next section",
    "we show that the limit @xmath15 is highly pathological .",
    "the general difficulties raised by an infinite basis are outlined here ; a detailed discussion is given in the following two sections .",
    "for definiteness we will restrict the discussion to finite one - dimensional systems with @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are analytic and bounded .",
    "re  @xmath0 will be kept uniformly bounded , re  @xmath75 , as @xmath1 becomes infinite . for @xmath76",
    "the conventional energy spectrum @xmath45 is discrete , and for sufficiently high eigenvalues exhibits increasing spacings @xcite between successive levels ( approximately proportional to the level index , as for the case @xmath77 ) .",
    "we will make repeated essential use of this feature .    in the limit @xmath3 one",
    "expects that for every @xmath0 the @xmath1 quasienergies within the finite interval @xmath25 will form a dense spectrum .",
    "in fact , weyl showed@xcite that for @xmath78 , so that @xmath79 , the spectrum is uniformly dense , provided only that @xmath80 is irrational .",
    "this is the generic situation@xcite for @xmath73 , @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , howland @xcite has shown that , for hamiltonians of the form ( [ hmodel ] ) , and for most values of the coupling strength @xmath0 , the quasienergies have a dense point spectrum .    what happens to the ac s in the limit @xmath3 ?",
    "we find a very simple picture in the complex @xmath0 plane : ac s correspond to branch points , as in fig .  2 .",
    "with increasing @xmath1 we add higher lying states of the unperturbed hamiltonian to the basis and find that the gaps of newly introduced ac s , as well as the imaginary part of the corresponding branch points ( see the appendix ) , decrease faster than any power law with @xmath1 .",
    "therefore the real @xmath0 axis is a line of accumulation for the branch points .",
    "moreover , the branch points with i m  @xmath82 are finite in number and tend to well - defined limits as @xmath3 , for any @xmath83 .",
    "the problems with the limit @xmath3 are restricted to the immediate neighborhood of the real @xmath0 axis .",
    "for real @xmath0 one expects the ac s to be dense in the @xmath14 plane .",
    "in fact , along each quasienergy curve @xmath39 obtained within a finite basis approximation one expects a dense set of ac s when @xmath15 .",
    "this has a number of consequences :    \\i ) as there will be ac s on each quasienergy curve for arbitrarily small values of @xmath0 , the radii of convergence @xmath52 of the perturbation theory in @xmath0 for quasienergies and floquet states all shrink to zero .",
    "\\ii ) the increase of the basis size from an initial value @xmath1 will introduce ac s arbitrarily close to any point on a given quasienergy curve defined with the initial basis of size @xmath1 .",
    "each of these ac s will make large changes in the corresponding floquet states over a finite @xmath0-interval , strongly admixing and interchanging pairs of states , as described above , and it is therefore by no means clear whether or not floquet states converge as @xmath3 .",
    "\\iii ) for any _ finite _ @xmath1 one can label the floquet states @xmath84 and quasienergies @xmath85 in such a way that they are continuous functions of @xmath0 ( if , as usual , we identify @xmath49 with @xmath86 ) . if we increase @xmath1 , we have to rearrange labels for every new ac , and it is not clear if there exists a meaningful labelling which tends to a well defined limit as @xmath3 .",
    "\\iv ) let the periodic field be switched on over the time interval @xmath87 , with @xmath88 .",
    "for any _ finite _ @xmath1 there is a well defined adiabatic limit , as @xmath71 , of the state ( up to an overall phase factor ) and of the quasienergy at the final time , @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath89 be the smallest of the rate parameters @xmath90 , defined by ( [ xi ] ) , characterizing the relevant ac s in @xmath91 $ ] . then , for @xmath92 the solution of the schrdinger equation  ( [ hturnon ] ) will simply follow the floquet state corresponding to a continuous quasienergy curve . in the limit @xmath3",
    ", however , there will be ac s with arbitrarily small parameters @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , for smaller @xmath61 more and more of these weak ac s will be passed adiabatically , rather than undergo landau - zener transitions , leading to completely different final states @xmath93 .",
    "thus an adiabatic limit as @xmath71 can not be expected .",
    "for systems of type ( [ hmodel ] ) we shall present strong arguments that , for a set of full measure in @xmath0 in an @xmath1-independent interval @xmath94 , the floquet states converge in the limit @xmath3 , even though the ac s are dense in the @xmath95 plane .",
    "this does not imply , however , that the limit is a continuous function of @xmath0 . for we will also argue that the ac s give rise to infinitely many @xmath0 s , of measure zero but dense in any @xmath0-interval , for which",
    "_ none _ of the floquet states of a finite basis converge .",
    "this can be stated more precisely as follows :    * proposition i ( convergence ) : * for any interval @xmath96 $ ] , any @xmath97 , and any @xmath98 , there is an integer @xmath99 with the following properties : for any @xmath100 and each @xmath101 there exists a label @xmath102 and an overall phase factor @xmath103 such that @xmath104 and @xmath105 - 1| < 2\\delta , \\label{propib}\\ ] ] for all @xmath106 , for all @xmath107 $ ] , and for all @xmath108 $ ] , except for a subset of @xmath0 of measure @xmath109 .",

    "that is , for this dense set of @xmath0 s the eigenfunctions within the smaller basis have arbitrarily small overlap with any of those corresponding to the larger basis ; they do not converge to a limit .",
    "proposition  i states that as @xmath1 grows , there is an increasing measure of @xmath0 where a finite basis calculation gives the floquet states and quasienergies correctly within an arbitrarily small error . for many practical purposes",
    "this supports the use of a finite basis for describing a floquet system .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to realize , as stated in proposition  ii , that even for an arbitrarily large basis size @xmath1 there are infinitely many @xmath0 s , dense in any interval ( albeit of total measure zero ) , where a given floquet state @xmath114 does _ not _ converge in the limit @xmath3",
    ".    we can prove proposition  i for any system with the following model property which , we submit , captures for this purpose the essence of a real floquet system of type ( [ hmodel ] ) : for an ac at @xmath115 $ ] we again define the interval @xmath116 , outside of which the admixture of the two unperturbed floquet states changes by no more than @xmath117 . then we assume that we can choose a set @xmath118 , with @xmath119 for any chosen @xmath120 , such that @xmath121 converges .",
    "this assumption appears to be satisfied in systems of type ( [ hmodel ] ) , although we have no mathematical proof .",
    "numerical calculations and analytical considerations ( see appendix ) suggest strongly that the gaps @xmath122 decrease faster than any negative power of @xmath10 , due to the increasing spacings of the unperturbed energies @xmath123 .",
    "let us choose @xmath117 to decrease relatively slowly , as a small power of @xmath10 , say @xmath124 .",
    "then the sum over @xmath125 will converge ( see eq .",
    "( [ width ] ) ) , as long as the difference @xmath126 in quasienergy slopes does nt decrease too rapidly with @xmath10 .",
    "numerical experience suggests this to be the case .",
    "we make an argument based on the borel - cantelli lemma  @xcite .",
    "let us start , as usual , with an approximation to the system given by restriction to a finite number @xmath110 of spatial basis functions .",
    "the new ac s introduced as this is increased to a complete , infinite , basis set are labelled from @xmath127 to @xmath128 . for a large enough choice of the initial basis size @xmath110 , the partial sum @xmath129 , which gives the measure of @xmath0 s where a floquet state might be affected by more than @xmath31 when increasing the basis size from @xmath110 to infinity ,",
    "can be made smaller than any given @xmath130 .",
    "for all other values of @xmath0 , those that are within none of the intervals @xmath116 , and which therefore constitute a set of measure at least @xmath131 , the floquet states are changed by no more than @xmath119 .",
    "this explains eq .",

    "( [ propia ] ) .",
    "the quasienergies can be determined from @xmath132 . for floquet states normalized by @xmath133",
    ", we can choose an @xmath106 and @xmath62 where @xmath134 .",
    "then @xmath135 can be determined from @xmath136 , which differs from @xmath137 by less than @xmath31 ( eq .  ( [ propia ] ) ) ,",
    "leading to eq .",
    "( [ propib ] ) .",
    "proposition  ii follows from the plausible , but unproved , assumption that any quasienergy line of a finite basis ( @xmath110 ) calculation will show an ac within any given @xmath0-interval , if the basis size is increased sufficiently . ( failure of this assumption would imply that there do exist finite @xmath0-intervals in which a quasienergy line is _ never _ crossed as @xmath138 . ) using that assumption , we can argue straightforwardly : within any given interval @xmath139 \\subset [ \\lambda_a,\\lambda_b]$ ] , for a suitably large basis size @xmath110 one will eventually find an ac .",
    "this crossing changes the @xmath140-th floquet state @xmath141 by more than some chosen amount , say 40% admixture of orthogonal basis states , over some finite @xmath0-interval . within that interval",
    "the two floquet states of the ac then have an overlap of less than @xmath142 with @xmath141 .",
    "we now select one of these states . with a further increase in the basis size",
    ", it will ultimately encounter an ac within the chosen interval and will be changed by more than 40% over some smaller but still finite @xmath0-interval . within that interval for an even larger basis size",
    "also the second state will be changed by more than 40% due to an ac .",
    "this leads to four floquet states within a finite @xmath0-interval , each with an overlap of less than @xmath143 with @xmath141 . repeating this argument",
    "sufficiently often , one finds a basis size @xmath144 and an interval @xmath145 where no floquet state @xmath146 has an overlap of more than a given @xmath31 with @xmath141 of the initial basis size @xmath110 , leading to proposition  ii . as stated in proposition  i , these @xmath0 s , even though they are dense , have a measure which tends to 0 as @xmath138 .",
    "we can derive a stronger version of proposition  ii . repeating the argument above for the @xmath147-th floquet state @xmath148 of the initial basis size @xmath110 ,",

    "this argument can be repeated for all floquet states @xmath152 of the initial basis .",
    "thus there is a dense set of @xmath0 s in any @xmath0-interval , where _ none _ of the floquet states of a finite basis converges @xcite .",
    "proposition  ii of the last section has an immediate consequence : a continuous labelling of the floquet states @xmath153 and quasienergies @xmath154 as a function of @xmath0 , possible for finite @xmath1 , is no longer possible in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "we therefore propose a new way of labelling , useful at least for small @xmath0 : we assign the label @xmath10 to a floquet state , if its overlap with the @xmath10-th eigenstate @xmath155 of @xmath18 is larger than 50% , in the sense @xmath156 this procedure will not always find a label for a floquet state .",
    "this is obvious for large @xmath0 , where none of the floquet states resembles a low lying unperturbed state .",
    "but , even for small @xmath0 , in the center region of an ac the overlap with an unperturbed state will be less than 50% .    since for small @xmath0",
    "the quasienergies are very flat as a function of @xmath0 , and ac s will generically occur only between floquet states related to states of @xmath18 that are far apart in energy , their ac s are expected to have a width that decreases faster than any power law as @xmath0 goes to zero ( appendix ) .",
    "we therefore expect that , on the interval @xmath157 $ ] , the labelling works for a cantor set of @xmath0 values with finite measure less than @xmath158 , and that this measure approaches @xmath158 as @xmath159 .",

    "equation  ( [ xiratio ] ) is due to the fact , that the ratio @xmath209 is , in the most unfavorable case , due to ac s of neighbouring levels @xmath210 and @xmath207 of @xmath18 with @xmath206 .",
    "the ratio of the corresponding quasienergy splittings decreases exponentially with @xmath211 and goes to zero in the limit @xmath212 .    from these properties",
    "we conclude that for @xmath61 larger than any @xmath213 the variation in @xmath200 due to infinitely many ac s can be made smaller than any given @xmath31 for sufficiently small @xmath158 .",
    "therefore for small enough @xmath158 one finds for all @xmath214 almost adiabatic behaviour in a window @xmath215 $ ] of turn - on parameters with @xmath216 arbitrarily large .      here",
    "we consider again the limit of turning on @xmath69 arbitrarily slowly from @xmath217 up to some arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "we have seen that the eigen_function _",
    "@xmath218 does not have a limit for @xmath71 .",
    "however , we will argue here ( but not prove mathematically ) that , as @xmath71 , @xmath218 is within arbitrary accuracy a linear combination of floquet states of the periodic hamiltonian ( eq .  ( [ hperiodic ] ) ) which have quasi_energies _ arbitrarily close to the _ initial _ value @xmath219  _ i.e. _ , the _ energy _",
    "modulo @xmath8 .",
    "thus in the limit @xmath71 quasienergy is a conserved quantity :    * proposition iv : * for any @xmath97 and any @xmath220 there exists an @xmath221 such that for all @xmath222 @xmath223 for all @xmath224 , and for all states @xmath47 .",
    "this is true even though @xmath225 does not exist for any finite time @xmath226 .    to make this plausible we will use a simplified geometrical picture , in which quasienergies are linear functions of @xmath0 .",
    "although all ac s are now represented by actual crossings , they will be traversed dynamically like real ac s with some finite rate parameters @xmath90 .",
    "the infinitely many quasienergy lines fall into two classes , according to whether the magnitudes of their slopes are smaller or larger than a specified critical value @xmath227 .",
    "we will further assume in this model that the latter ( large slope ) class , for any @xmath228 and any @xmath220 , has only a finite number @xmath229 of members .",
    "in the course of turning on the periodic driving from 0 up to @xmath0 with a small enough turn - on parameter @xmath61 , the infinitely many quasienergy lines with slopes @xmath230 will , at most , cause a deviation in quasienergy by @xmath231 ( @xmath232 ) away from the initial value @xmath219 .",
    "the additional changes in quasienergy from ac s with the finite number @xmath229 of steeper quasienergy lines can also be restricted to be less than @xmath233 by a sufficiently small choice of turn - on rate @xmath61 : since the ac s are dense on any quasienergy line , for sufficiently small @xmath61 one will be diverted from any of the steep quasienergy lines within any given small quasienergy range , which we choose to be @xmath234 . the total change in quasienergy as @xmath0",
    "is increased from 0 to its final value thus can be made smaller than @xmath235 for any given @xmath236 .",
    "for @xmath237 and within this simplified model we have thus proved proposition  iv .",
    "the same arguments should hold for the original floquet problem , as including the quasienergy dependence on @xmath0 at the ac s reduces their steepness and thus further reduces the spread in quasienergy from the above estimates . also , the overall nonlinear dependence on @xmath0 which follows , _",
    "e.g. _ , from second order perturbation theory , poses no problem for the argument .",
    "the assumption that the number @xmath229 of slopes larger in magnitude than @xmath238 is finite , remains reasonable , since an increase in the basis size introduces floquet states originating from higher lying states of @xmath18 , which show decreasing dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "however , the problem of defining slopes at all ( in the limit @xmath3 ) , as there is no continuous labelling of the quasienergies as a function of @xmath0 , will make a mathematical proof difficult .",
    "this proposition leads us to a better understanding of the nature of the state @xmath218 in the limit @xmath71 .",
    "as @xmath218 is a linear combination of floquet states with quasienergies closer and closer to @xmath239 , it changes constantly as @xmath31 and @xmath61 go to zero .",
    "thus , while there can not be an adiabatic limit for the wave function , quasienergy is conserved in the limit @xmath176 .",
    "non - linear optics is a major field of science in which traditional , finite order perturbation theory in the applied electric field ( usually to low order ) successfully describes experiment .",
    "here we shall show why this well - established theory is consistent with our considerations in spite of our conclusion that , strictly speaking the radii of convergence , @xmath52 , of perturbation theory vanish .",
    "we reiterate first that if the turn - on rate @xmath71 , perturbative non - linear optics in fact fails . for small @xmath0",

    "we have seen that @xmath242 is exponentially and unphysically small . for finite small @xmath0",
    "the perturbation expansion is asymptotically convergent .",
    "finally we briefly mention the unavoidable effects of line broadening .",
    "the quantum system of interest is inevitably in contact with its environment , and there are interactions between the many particles that ordinarily constitute the quantum system of interest , so the individual particle states are lifetime broadened .",
    "we conjecture that if broadening is characterized by a finite width @xmath243 , then a finite radius of convergence will be restored .",
    "there have been two standard approaches to dealing with the behavior of quantum systems subject to strong time periodic fields .",
    "one is the use of finite order perturbation theory ( e.g. , second or third order nonlinear optical susceptibilities ) , and the other the exact solution of the problem within a finite basis of states . but both of these approaches miss qualitative features of the exact mathematical solutions .",
    "we have shown by a set of  propositions \" ( as opposed to rigorous mathematical proofs ) that for a large class of time periodic problems the structure of the exact states and the quasienergy spectrum is remarkably irregular . by ",
    "exact \" we mean here that the complete infinite set of basis states is included .",
    "interaction with the environment is neglected .",
    "we have considered the states and quasienergies as functions of the strength @xmath0 of the time periodic potential , as the number @xmath1 of basis states becomes infinite .",
    "we have found that in any interval @xmath244 , although the states converge to a well defined limit as @xmath15 for a set of @xmath0 with the full measure @xmath245 of the interval , there is a set of @xmath0 , of total measure zero , but _ dense _ within every finite interval , for which the states do _ not _ converge . as a result , in contrast to the situation for any finite @xmath1 , it is impossible to label states and quasienergies continuously as a function of @xmath0 . the familiar quasienergy ",
    "dispersion \" curves as functions of @xmath0 ( as shown , _",
    "e.g. _ , in fig .",
    "1 ) become discontinuous everywhere .",
    "one consequence of these discontinuities is the absence of a true adiabatic limit ; there is no unique final state to which the system tends as the periodic perturbation is switched on arbitrarily slowly .",
    "but these pathologies , including a radius of convergence of perturbation theory in @xmath0 which approaches zero as @xmath3 , do not show up under most physically realistic circumstances .",
    "in particular , we have explained the familiar and well established success of ordinary time dependent perturbation theory in terms of the modified adiabatic theorem and the typical smallness of the parameter @xmath246 which enters that theorem in practice , as well as the successes of finite basis calculations .",
