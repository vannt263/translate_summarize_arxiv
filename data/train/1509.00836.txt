    "<S> motivated by damage due to heating in sensor operation , we consider the throughput optimal offline data scheduling problem in an energy harvesting transmitter such that the resulting temperature increase remains below a critical level . </S>",
    "<S> we model the temperature dynamics of the transmitter as a linear system and determine the optimal transmit power policy under such temperature constraints as well as energy harvesting constraints over an awgn channel . </S>",
    "<S> we first derive the structural properties of the solution for the general case with multiple energy arrivals . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the optimal power policy is piecewise monotone decreasing with possible jumps at the energy harvesting instants . </S>",
    "<S> we derive analytical expressions for the optimal solution in the single energy arrival case . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in the single energy arrival case , the optimal power is monotone decreasing , the resulting temperature is monotone increasing , and both remain constant after the temperature hits the critical level . </S>",
    "<S> we then generalize the solution for the multiple energy arrival case . </S>"
