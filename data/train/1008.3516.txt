    "@xmath85 are small , hence the contribution of only @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 can be kept for the description of the @xmath89 transition .",
    "we use a modified @xmath90 , which is a renormalization scheme independent combination of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , given by a formula that can be found , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of the operators in @xmath93 can be written in terms of form factors , so that the differential decay width of @xmath77 reads : @xmath94 \\nonumber\\\\ \\hspace{-0.7 cm } + ( q^2 + 2m_\\ell^2)\\lambda\\bigg| c_9f_1(q^2)+\\frac{2c_7^{eff}(m_b - m_s ) f_t(q^2)}{m_{b_s}+m_{f_0}}\\bigg|^2 \\bigg\\},\\nn   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath95 , @xmath96 the fine structure constant and @xmath97 the lepton mass .",

    "in the @xmath5 sector , @xmath4 is the golden mode to investigate cp violation . analysing it ,",
    "cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite collaborations have obtained values of the @xmath5 mixing phase @xmath114 much larger than expected in the sm , modulo a large experimental uncertainty .",
    "hence , it is of prime importance to consider other processes to measure @xmath9 , as @xmath115 and @xmath116 in which the final state is a cp eigenstate and no angular analysis is required to disentangle the various cp components , as needed for @xmath4 .",
    "however , the reconstruction of @xmath5 modes into @xmath117 and @xmath118 is experimentally challenging , since the subsequent @xmath117 or @xmath118 decays involve photons in the final state .",
    "the case of @xmath34 seems feasible , since @xmath34 essentially decays to @xmath119 and to @xmath120 @xcite .    from the theory viewpoint , the quantitative description of nonleptonic decays is challenging . using the operator product expansion and renormalization group methods one can write an effective hamiltonian as for the modes in the previous section .",
    "however , now one has to consider hadronic matrix elements @xmath121 with @xmath84 four - quark operators , the calculation of which is a nontrivial task . in order to estimate the size of the @xmath122 decay rate , we use the generalized factorization approach , in which such quantities are replaced by products of matrix elements that are expressed in terms of meson decay constants and hadronic form factors .",
    "the wilson coefficients ( or appropriate combinations of them ) are regarded as effective parameters to be fixed from experiment . using this ansatz",
    ", the decay amplitude of @xmath123 reads @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the @xmath126 polarization vector , @xmath127 the @xmath5 momentum and @xmath128 mev the @xmath126 decay constant .",
    "@xmath129 is a combination of wilson coefficients that can be extracted from @xmath130 @xcite , assuming that @xmath129 is the same in the two processes .",
    "this requires the form factor @xmath131 .",
    "we use two different parameterizations , obtained by short - distance ( cdss ) @xcite and light - cone qcd sum rules ( bz ) @xcite . the result for the two sets of form factors",
    "is : @xmath132 , @xmath133 .",
    "we use the average value @xmath134 and our result for the @xmath72 form factors to compute @xmath135 , obtaining @xmath136 large enough to be measured ; notice that @xmath137 @xcite . comparing these results to @xmath138 ( @xmath139 denotes a longitudinally polarized meson )",
    "computed using factorization , we find : @xmath140 a compatible result : @xmath141 was found in @xcite , using the ratio of @xmath142 decay widths to @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "these considerations show that @xmath145 can be used to measure @xmath9 , since a large number of events is expected and it does not require an angular analysis to separate different cp components of the final state .",
    "this is also the case of @xmath146 , modulo the difficulty of the @xmath147 reconstruction .",
    "although suppressed in naive factorization , its branching fraction may be enhanced by non factorizable mechanisms  @xcite as for @xmath148 .",
    "on the basis of @xmath149 symmetry , we expect @xmath150 as in the case of @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "exploiting the lcsr calculation of @xmath14 form factors we find that the branching ratios of @xmath152 and @xmath13 will be accessible at future machines , like a super b factory , and at the lhcb experiment .",
    "we also predict @xmath153 , thus @xmath3 is promising to access @xmath9 .",
