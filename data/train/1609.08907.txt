    "exciton - polaritons in 2d semiconductor cavity structures being an equipollent combination of cavity photons and elementary matter excitations ( excitons ) and exhibiting properties of both their constituents represent a fascinating object for study both from the fundamental point of view and for applications in opto - electronics . until recently",
    ", one of the key constraints for observation of long - range polariton propagation was the extremely short polariton lifetime which in the best case would nt exceed few tens of picoseconds  @xcite . since exciton - polaritons are composite quasiparticles arising due to the strong coupling of photons and excitons , they have a finite lifetime that is governed by lifetime of photons in the cavity  @xcite . in recent papers",
    "@xcite an increase of the polariton lifetime up to of the order of 100  ps due to the use of specially designed 2d cavities with ultra - high quality factors has been reported . in these structures , polaritons can move away from the excitation spot by the distances of the order of a few millimetres in a cavity plane .",
    "the possibility of generation of a long - range coherent polariton flow in high - finesse microcavities is very promising for realization of ultrafast optoelectronic devices .    given the possibility of long - living polaritons excitation , a subject of the control of their spatial dynamics arises .",
    "one of the convenient approaches to manipulation of exciton - polariton dynamical characteristics is through the generation of an external potential of a required configuration . in this context , the idea of polariton acceleration in a cavity with the gradient of the cavity thickness has been discussed in @xcite and then developed in  @xcite .",
    "reduction of the cavity width leads to a positive shift of the lower dispersion branch ( lb ) of polaritons .",
    "since the latter is concave , to conserve the energy fixed , lb polaritons are forced to reduce their wave vector component in the propagation direction .",
    "their group velocity in the same direction decreases as a result . as it has been shown in  @xcite , in samples where the cavity width decreases linearly with one of the in - plane",
    "coordinates polaritons propagate on parabolic trajectories .",
    "herewith , contribution of a cavity thickness variation can be described as an effect of an external constant force analogous to the gravitational force acting on massive particles .    due to the specificity of the polariton dynamics in such conditions ,",
    "polaritons have been observed to slow down until a complete stop and then reverse their propagation direction  @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .   refer to such type of motion as `` slow reflection '' .",
    "this effect has been proposed in  @xcite as a tool for suppression of the light reflection by the edge of the sample wich is essential for diminishing the parasitic effects caused by interference polaritons propagating towards the edge with the reflected ones .",
    "in contrast with the normal reflection , in the case of `` slow reflection '' the phase of propagating polaritons does not change abruptly at the turning point but varies continuously . the latter point is essential for understanding of the non - trivial interference of the direct and reflected polariton waves , as we show below .",
    "exciton - polaritons are widely discussed as potential candidates for all - optical information transport , storage and processing because of their non - trivial polarization properties .",
    "the cavity polariton polarization is mostly dependent on two factors that are the long - range electron - hole exchange interaction  @xcite and the polarization splitting of the photonic cavity modes  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the te - tm splitting of the cavity eigenmodes leads to the splitting of linearly polarized polariton dispersion branches that induces the precession of the polarization vector of propagating polaritons  @xcite .",
    "one can describe the polariton polarization using the pseudospin formalism  @xcite .",
    "the polariton te - em splitting effect can be described as the polariton pseudospin precession around an effective magnetic field applied in the cavity plane .",
    "the non - trivial polariton pseudospin dynamics has been revealed in a wide range of experimentally observed efects including the polarization multistability  @xcite , spin switching  @xcite , optical spin hall effect  @xcite , etc . in the presence of the external magnetic field @xmath0 ,",
    "the polariton pseudospin dynamics becomes even more complicated .",
    "for the field applied in the faraday geometry ( @xmath0 is normal to the cavity plane and is collinear with the incident light wave vector ) , the exciton - polariton energy band structure is enriched with the zeeman splitting of right- and left - circularly polarized polariton states  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the pseudospin dynamics of long - living polaritons in a wedged 2d microcavity under the influence of the `` gravitational '' force produced by the cavity width gradient in the presence of the external magnetic field applied normally to the cavity plane .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in sec .",

    "it basically coincides with that studied experimentally in refs .  .",
    "the sample represents a semiconductor microcavity with embedded quantum wells that are holders of excitons .",
    "the cavity is characterized by a linear variation of the thickness in @xmath1-direction that causes a polariton energy gradient in the same direction .",
    "the exciton - polaritons are supposed to be excited resonantly by the external laser beam .",
    "we shell consider both the regime of excitation by ultrashort laser pulses and the regime of continuous wave pumping .",
    "the initial quantum state of generated polaritons , their polarization , energy and wave vector are supposed to be set by the exciting laser .",
    "one can fully characterize the polarization ( pseudospin ) state of cavity polaritons by the four - component stokes vector @xmath2 , where @xmath3 characterize the intensities of linear ( collinear with the original coordinate basis axes components and diagonal / antidiagonal ones ) and circular polarization components , respectively , while @xmath4 corresponds to the total intensity of a polarized polariton wave  @xcite .",

    "<S> the pseudospin dynamics of long - living exciton - polaritons in a wedged 2d cavity has been studied theoretically accounting for the external magnetic field effect . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity width variation plays the role of the artificial gravitational force acting on a massive particle : exciton - polariton . </S>",
    "<S> a semi - classical model of the spin - polarization dynamics of ballistically propagating exciton - polaritons has been developed . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that for the specific choise of the magnetic field magnitude and the initial polariton wave vector the polariton polarization vector tends to an attractor on the poincar sphere . </S>",
    "<S> based on this effect , the switching the polariton polarization in the ballistic regime has been demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> the self - interference of the polariton field emitted by a point - like source has been shown to induce the formation of interference patterns reminiscent of the interference patterns of cylindrical and plane waves . </S>"
