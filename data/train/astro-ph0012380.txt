    "accretion onto a black hole is observed to produce copious x  ray emission . at high mass accretion rates ( approaching the eddington limit )",
    "the spectra are dominated by a soft component at @xmath0 kev which is strongly ( very high state : vhs ) or weakly ( high state : hs ) comptonized by low temperature thermal ( or quasi ",
    "thermal ) electrons with @xmath1 kev ( e.g.  et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "there is also a rather steep power law tail ( @xmath2 ) which extends out beyond @xmath3 kev in the few objects with good high energy data ( e.g. grove et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "at lower mass accretion rates , below @xmath4 per cent of eddington (  et al . , 1998 ;  et al . , 1999 ) , there is a rather abrupt transition when the soft component drops in temperature and luminosity .",
    "instead this ( low state : ls ) spectrum is dominated by thermal comptonization , with @xmath5 , rolling over at energies of @xmath6 kev ( see e.g. the reviews by tanaka & lewin 1995 ; van der klis 1995 ; nowak 1995 ) .",
    "this spectral form seems to continue even down to very low luminosities ( @xmath7 per cent of eddington : the quiescent or off state e.g. kong et al .",
    "these very different spectra can all be seen from a single object where the mass accretion rate changes substantially .",
    "figure 1 ( left panel ) shows vhs , hs and ls spectra from the gbhc transient rxte j1550 - 564 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     -24pt    the left panel of figure 3 shows the reflected spectrum from a slab of neutral , solar abundance material viewed at @xmath8 ( light grey / green ) compared to that from a disk extending down to 3 schwarzchild radii around a black hole .",
    "the greens functions for the reflected continuum are taken from magdziarz & zdziarski ( 1995 ) , which include compton downscattering at all energies .",
    "the iron line is calculated self consistently with the continuum reflection ( including compton downscattering on the line profile ) using the code of  & czerny ( 1994 ) , and the whole spectrum ( line and continuum ) is smeared assuming that the flux irradiating the accretion disk @xmath9 ( see appendix a of  et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "the right panel of figure 3 shows the same for a highly ionised reflector .",
    "the resulting spectrum now depends strongly on details of the assumed ionization structure , both as a function of height and of radius . here",
    "we assume that the slab has a constant ionization parameter @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the illuminating luminosity , at a distance @xmath12 from the reflector of constant density @xmath13 ) .",
    "the photo  electric opacity is calculated by determining the ion populations ( balancing photo  ionization with collisional recombination as as in done et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "the electron temperature may then cause appreciable compton upscattering ( ross & fabian 1993 ; ross , fabian & young 1999 ) .",
    "this is _ not _ included in the reflected continuum calculation ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) , although it is included to some extent in the line profile (  & czerny 1994 but see the discussion in ross et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "as can be seen from these figures , the fraction of reflected flux in the 120 kev band is dependent on the ionization state of the material as well as the solid angle subtended by it .",
    "the ionization state is determined mostly by the line and edge energies ( although the reflection continuum shape is also important ) . but these energies can be shifted by relativistic effects ( ross , fabian & brandt 1996 ) . thus all three parameters ( solid angle , ionization state and relativistic smearing ) should be fit simultaneously in order to determine the geometry of the system .",
    "the quiescent spectra are too faint to do detailed spectral fitting or variability power spectra , but they do appear to be hard @xmath14 i.e. to be related to the ls spectra ( e.g. kong et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "there is much more information on the ( much brighter ) ls spectra .",
    "the ls spectra are relatively hard @xmath15 extending out to @xmath16 kev , which is an immediate problem for a ` disk ",
    "corona ' geometry where the magnetic flares are close enough together to form a quasi  continuous corona above the disk .",
    "in such a geometry , the hard x  ray corona radiates about as much power down towards the disk as up towards the observer .",
    "the downwards flux illuminates the disk , and some fraction ( given by the energy integrated reflection albedo ) is reflected but the rest is thermalised in the disk , forming an additional seed photon source ( haardt & maraschi 1993 ) . the reflection albedo can not approach unity even if the disk is completely ionised due to compton downscattering of the high energy spectrum . for @xmath17 the maximum albedo @xmath18 ,",
    "so the _ minimum _ soft seed flux is approximately a quarter of the hard luminosity .",
    "yet this ratio of soft  to  hard flux would result in a compton spectrum with @xmath19 ( haardt & maraschi 1993 ; poutanen 1998 ) .",
    "thus the ` disk ",
    "corona ' geometry is ruled out .",
    "if the magnetic corona exists , it must be patchy ( stern et al 1995 ;  et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "the solid angle subtended by a disk below a ( static ) patchy corona would be @xmath20 .",
    "clearly this can be tested by looking at the amount of reflection , which is easily seen in the ls spectra ( e.g. done et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "fitting simultaneously for the solid angle , ionization state and relativistic smearing gives that the reflector subtends a solid angle of @xmath21 , is predominantly neutral , and significantly broadened but _ not _ by as much as expected if the reflecting material extended down to the last stable orbit (  et al .",
    ", 1997 ; 1998 ; 1999 ; done & 1999 ) .",
    "this means that fitting without including the effects of relativistic smearing and/or ionization does not lead to large distortions of the derived parameters . fitting only for solid angle and ionization (  et al .",
    ", 1997 ; zdziarski ,  & smith 1999 ) or for solid angle and smearing ( approximated by a gaussian : gilfanov et al . , 1999 ;",
    "revnivtsev et al . , 2000 ) , show overwhelmingly that the solid angle is significantly less than @xmath22 , correlated with the spectral index in the sense that harder continuua show smaller reflected fractions ( zdziarski et al . , 1999 ;",
    "gilfanov et al 1999 ; revnivtsev et al 2000 ) , _ and _ a smaller amount of smearing of the spectral features ( gilfanov et al 1999 ; revnivtsev et al 2000 ) .",
    "these correlations extend to the time domain .",
    "frequency resolved spectra show that the fastest variability is characterised by a flatter spectrum and lower reflected fraction ( revnivtsev et al . , 1999 ) . also",
    ", the characteristic break frequency in the ls variability power spectra _ increases _ as the spectrum steepens and the reflected amplitude and smearing increase ( gilfanov et al 1999 ; revnivtsev et al 2000 ) .    the static patchy corona model above a mainly neutral disk is ruled out by the observations of @xmath23 for hard spectra ( see beloborodov 2001 , these proceedings )",
    ". for magentic coronae models to work then either the coronae are not static or the disk is ionized .",
    "outflow from magnetic reconnection is seen in the sun , so it could also happen above the disk .",
    "if the outflow velocity is transrelativistic then the hard x  ray radiation from the reconnection is beamed away from the disk .",
    "this reduces the disk illumination , and thus the reflected fraction and the reprocessed soft seed photons .",
    "faster outflow velocities then give fewer reprocessed soft photons and smaller reflected fractions ( giving the @xmath24 correlation ) , and if these faster velocities are concentrated towards smaller radii then this would also suppress the relativistic smearing signature from the inner disk ( beloborodov 1999 ) .",
    "however , the mechanism for the spectral transition ( ls  hs ) is not entirely clear . given that it seems likely that the hs / vhs emission is powered by reconnection , then it requires that the spectral transition is associated with the magnetic loops mainly reconnecting inside the optically thick material , rather than buoyantly rising above the disk .",
    "one potential trigger for this could be that the disk becomes radiation pressure dominated  although agn disks are in general radiation pressure dominated yet can show hard spectra and low reflected fractions e.g. zdziarski et al . , ( 1999 ) ; chiang et al .",
    ", ( 2000 ) ; done et al . , ( 2000 ) .",
    "similarly the link to the variability power spectra is also not obvious : the particular radius picked out by the qpo / low frequency break can not be the radius at which the disk becomes radiation pressure dominated as this would _ increase _ as the luminosity increases from ls  vhs while the power spectral features imply a _ decreasing _ radius .",
    "this seems immediately ruled out by the observation that the reflected spectrum is mostly neutral in the ls .",
    "however , one way to suppress both line and reflected continuum is from a radial dependance of ionization state . if the inner region of the disk were so highly ionised that even iron is completely stripped then it produces no atomic features .",
    "its reflected continuum is unobservable in the 220 kev range and it appears instead to be part of the power law continuum .",
    "the observed reflected spectrum could then come from material further out in the disk which is mostly neutral , and not highly relativistically smeared .",
    "since the reflected fraction is the ratio of the observed reflection relative to the inferred incidence flux then @xmath25 is low both due to the inner disk solid angle being missed and because this unidentified reflected signature boosts the incident flux ( ross et al . , 1999 )    however , for a smooth ( power law ) distribution in ionization parameter with radius then between the extreme ionization inner disk and more neutral outer disk there must be an intermediate region of high ionization , where iron is mainly in h and he  like ions .",
    "these produce huge spectral features ( see figure 3 , right panel ) , which are unmistakable .",
    "the ionised disk models can be split into radial zones of different ionization to test these ideas and in cyg x1 they can be shown to be incompatible with the data ( done &  1999 ) .",
    "admittedly these models do not properly model the compton upscattering of the edge features ( and slightly underestimate the compton broadening of the line : ross et al . , 1999 )",
    "associated with the high ionization material , but this is probably not a large distortion .    similarly , the assumption of a constant ionization parameter slab can ( and should ) break down in the vertical direction .",
    "illumination of the surface of the disk can result in an extreme ionization skin , which is completely reflective .",
    "some of the incident flux is reflected in the skin , reducing the irradiating flux in the lower layers , so their ionization state is smaller .",
    "deep enough in the disk then the material can be mostly neutral , giving the observed reflected signature which has @xmath26 as the illuminating flux for that layer is not the full incident flux and the apparent incident flux is boosted by the featureless reflected flux from the extremely ionised upper skin ( ross & fabian 1993 ; ross et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "again though , there are problems with the intermediate ionization layers . if the ionization parameter varies smoothly as a ( power law ) function of height in the disk then between the extreme ionization and mostly neutral material there should be the highly ionised h and he like iron , with its unmistakable reflected spectral features .",
    "however , comptonization is now much more of a problem as this spectrum has to be transmitted upwards through the extremely ionised , hot skin .",
    "this additional compton broadening _ may _ be able to smear these features enough to disguise their presence .",
    "such models have yet to be tested against the data but it seems likely that if the comptonization is strong enough to distort the h and he reflected spectrum then it should also distort the observed _ neutral _ reflection signature .",
    "this also has to be transmitted through ( even more of ) the comptonizing layers , and yet it is easily detected .    again in these models , as with the outflowing corona , there is no obvious trigger for the ls  hs transition or particular radius to use for the power spectral variability .",
    "a far more wideranging problem with the ionised reflection models considered to date is that they _",
    "assume _ a given density structure as a function of height .",
    "at best , the codes take this structure and then work out the temperature and ionization state of the material as a function of height .",
    "but x  ray illumination _",
    "changes _ the density structure of the material .",
    "material at the top of the disk is heated by the illumination , and so can expand , lowering its density .",
    "deeper into the disk there is less x  ray heating , so the material is cooler , and hence denser .",
    "the self  consistent density structure is especially important as there is a thermal ionization instability which affects x  ray illuminated material in pressure balance ( field 1965 ; krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 ; kallman & white 1989 ; ko & kallman 1994 ;  & czerny 1996 ; nayakshin , kazanas & kallman 2000 , hereafter nkk ) .",
    "the disk is in hydrostic equilibrium in the vertical direction , so the gas pressure , @xmath27 must increase with depth into the disk . in these circumstances , it is clearer to talk about the ionization structure in terms of the pressure ionization parameter @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the radiation pressure of the illuminating radiation ( this relates to the density photo ",
    "ionization parameter @xmath30 ) .",
    "the x  ray heating clearly depends on height , with the material at the top of the layer being heated the most .",
    "because the material is in pressure balance , the gas pressure is smallest at the top of the disk , so @xmath31 is at its maximum here .",
    "this corresponds to the uppermost stable branch of the ionization equilibrium s ",
    "curve on an @xmath32 plot , with low density material which is highly or completely ionized .",
    "atomic cooling is negligible so the temperature is a fraction of the local compton temperature ( see krolik et al . , 1981 and nayakshin 2000 ) ; compton heating is balanced by compton cooling and bremsstrahlung .",
    "going deeper down into the disk , the x  ray heating decreases with optical depth to electron scattering , @xmath33 , and the gas pressure increases . hence , both the temperature and ionization parameter @xmath31 decrease .",
    "however , there is then a turning point on the s ",
    "curve , where the temperature and density are such that the rapidly increasing bremsstrahlung cooling causes the temperature to dramatically decrease .",
    "this pulls the gas pressure down , but hydrostatic equilibrium requires that the gas pressure must monotonically increase as a function of depth into the disk .",
    "the only way for the pressure to increase in a region with rapidly decreasing temperature is to rapidly increase the density , but this pushes up the cooling still further , and so decreases the temperature .",
    "ionic and atomic species can now exist , so line transitions give a yet further increase in the cooling .",
    "eventually this stabilises onto the bottom part of the s curve , where the x  ray heating is balanced primarily by line cooling from low temperature , high density material .",
    "this results in an almost _ discontinuous _ transition from a highly ionized , hot and relatively tenuous skin to mainly neutral , cool and relatively dense material .",
    "reflection can then be suppressed as in the previous section , by the decrease in illuminating flux on the neutral layer because of scattering in the ionised skin , and because the scattered ( reflected ) spectrum from the ionised skin is interpreted as incident continuum .",
    "the difference is that the ionization parameter can now make an _ abrupt _ rather than smooth transition from highly or extremely ionised to mostly neutral material ( nkk ) .",
    "the resulting reflected spectrum is crucially determined by the optical depth where this instability occurs _ and _ the compton temperature of the skin ( which depends on the illuminating power law as well as the local thermal disk spectrum ) . for hard spectra , @xmath34 ,",
    "then the compton temperature of the upper layer of the disk is high @xmath35 kev , its ionization is extreme so it produces no reflected spectral features .",
    "if the instability occurs after an optical depth of @xmath36 then the apparent reflected fraction is @xmath37 from neutral material , as observed . for steeper spectra the compton temperature of the upper layers drops .",
    "thus the instability point occurs rather higher in the disk , so the optical depth of the skin decreases , and the amount of reflected flux increases ( giving the @xmath24 correlation !",
    "the right panel of figure 1 shows results from fitting simulated 220 kev ginga resolution spectra of these full vertical structure models with the fixed density reflection models .",
    "the apparent @xmath24 is clearly seen for the ls @xmath14 spectra ( done & nayakshin 2000 ) .",
    "these models concentrate on the vertical ionisation structure , but there should also be a radial dependance .",
    "larger radii should be less ionised and the total disk spectrum is found by integrating over all these different ionisations . however , the meaning of less ionized is very different from that in the constant density models  the skin remains completely ionized with a negligible amount of h and he  like iron , but its thomson depth decreases with radius ( see nayakshin 2000 ) .",
    "thus the inner disk can have a larger skin depth , so suppressing the most extreme relativistically smeared line components ( nayakshin 2000 ) .",
    "perhaps this also gives a radius where the skin depth changes from @xmath38 to @xmath39 which could pick out a characteristic frequency for the power spectral variability , although the mechanism for the ls  hs transition is again not clear ( see previous section ) .",
    "all the observations can all be qualitatively explained in the truncated disk  advective inner flow model , with the disk progressively penetrating further into the advective flow .",
    "the geometry automatically gives a rather ` photon starved ' hard continuum . as the overlap between the two phases increases , the soft seed photon flux intercepted by the hot inner flow gets larger , and so leads to a steeper continuum .",
    "but the increasing overlap also gives a larger solid angle subtended by the disk ( resulting in a @xmath24 correlation : poutanen , krolik & ryde 1997 ) .",
    "the decreasing inner radius of the disk also gives the increasingly relativistically smeared spectral features , _ and _ higher frequency power spectral features .",
    "the advective flow collapses at luminosities at a few per cent of eddington , giving a physical mechanism for the state transition which is observed at these fluxes .",
    "the only problem is a quantitative one .",
    "the inner disk radii deduced from the relativistic smearing are @xmath40 schwarzchild radii .",
    "standard advective flow calculations assume that the transition radius between the ss disk and hot inner flow is large @xmath41 schwarzchild radii .",
    "this is an assumption , and can be changed .",
    "the transition radius can be physically determined by calculating the evaporation rate from the ionised disk skin (  & czerny 2000 ) , but irrespective of the mechanism , moving the disk inwards ( and especially increasing the overlap between the two flows ) increases the soft seed photon flux intercepted by the advective flow , leading to stronger compton cooling . bringing the disk in to @xmath40 schwarzchild radii",
    "lowers the maximum luminosity at which the advective flow can exist by a factor of 23 ( esin 1997 ) , which then makes the ls ",
    "hs / vhs state transition at slightly lower luminosities than observed",
    ".    however , the ideas developed above about the ionization structure of the disk should also apply here . any hydrostatic disk illuminated by hard x ",
    "rays is subject to the thermal instability , and so should have an ionised skin .",
    "the observed neutral reflected spectrum is transmitted through this skin , and is subject to compton broadening .",
    "if some fraction of the width of the line is due to compton scattering rather than relativistic effects then this would result in an underestimate of the disk radius , and so extend the maximum luminosity of the advective flow back into the observed range .",
    "much less work has been done on x  ray reflection in the soft states .",
    "the only spectra which have been analysed with both ionisation and relativistic smearing included in the reflected spectrum are nova muscae (  et al . , 1998 ) , rxte j1550 - 564 ( wilson & done 2000 ) and cyg x1 ( gilfanov et al .",
    ", 1999 ;  et al 1999 ) .",
    "fitting with the fixed density / ionization structure models gives a solid angle of @xmath42 of strongly ionised material , and that the spectral features are strongly smeared .",
    "fits which do not include ionisation of the reflector will _ overestimate _ the solid angle subtended by the reflecting material ( compare the left and right panels of figure 3 ) , so the results of gilfanov et al . , ( 1999 ) on the @xmath43 smearing correlations will probably change significantly for the steep spectrum objects in their sample when ionisation is included .",
    "the true solid angle is again hard to infer due to ionization effects . even with the fixed density reflection models it depends on how the ionization varies as a function of radius (  et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "obviously the ionization can also vary as a function of height , and the ionization instability again should operate . for steep spectral illumination this does not generally lead to suppression of the observed reflected flux as the compton temperature of the skin is not high enough to completely strip iron .",
    "instead it is dominated by h and he  like iron and so its reflected spectrum can be seen directly ( figure 1 , right panel ; done & nayakshin 2000 ) .",
    "but yet another problem for the reflection models is that the disk should now be substantially collisionally ionised , as well as photo  ionised .",
    "even more uncertainty comes from the geometry .",
    "if the thermal / non  thermal electrons are co  spatial then both should illuminate the disk .",
    "but if only the non  thermal electrons are associated with magnetic reconnection , while the thermal electrons are from a heated disk skin then most of the incident flux for reflection will be only from the non  thermal power law , while the observed incident continuum below 20 kev can be dominated by the thermal compton component .",
    "this would dilute the observed solid angle ( wilson & done 2000 ;  et al . , 1999 ) , but the compton continuum produced from a non  thermal electron distribution can be highly anisotropic , which could boost the observed solid angle ( ghisellini et al . , 1991 ) !",
    "gbhc show different spectral states which roughly correspond to luminosity , with the ls ",
    "hs / vhs transition occurring at 24 per cent of eddington . in the ls ( @xmath44 ) , fitting the spectra with ( fixed density ) models of x  ray reflection gives that the solid angle subtended by the disk is small @xmath45 , that the material is mainly neutral , and that the spectral features are broadened , but not by as much as expected from relativistic effects if the disk extended down to the last stable orbit around the black hole .",
    "if the smearing is due to relativistic effects alone then it implies that the reflecting material only extends down to @xmath46 schwarzchild radii .",
    "all these correlate , with steeper spectra having more reflection and more broadening ( and higher frequency features in the power spectra ) .",
    "these observations rule out the continuous corona model ( from the overall hard spectral shape ) and a static patchy corona above a neutral disk ( from @xmath26 ) and a static patchy corona above an ionised disk ( as the reflector is mainly neutral ) and advective flows ( from the combination of small inner radius and high luminosity ) .",
    "only the outflowing corona ( beloborodov 1999 ) can fit these ` observed ' parameters .",
    "radial ionization structure is unlikely to change these conclusions , although vertical ionization structure can give some loopholes due to compton scattering of the observed reflected signature ( ross et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "this _ may _ distort the reflected signature from a static patchy corona by enough to not see the high ionization zone , and compton broadening _ may _ allow the advective flow inner radius to be significantly larger .",
    "however , the constant density models can be seriously misleading due to the ionization instability ( nkk ) .",
    "this can cause a discontinuous transition between an extremely ionised skin overlying mostly neutral material , and can reproduce the observations ( and correlations ) with a static patchy magnetic corona .",
    "but this instability should be present whatever the mechanism for illumination of the disk , so it can also co  exist with either an advective flow or an outflowing corona .",
    "this of course completely removes any diagnostic power from the fixed density reflection models ( done & nayakshin 2000 ) .    for the hs and vhs the reflected spectrum",
    "is plainly highly ionised and broadened . however , the solid angle is even less constrained than in the ls due to the complex continuum , which could represent a single thermal / non  thermal electron population or could represent two entirely spatially distinct regions , with different solid angles for illumination of the disk material .",
    "reflection _ may _ be able to live up to its promise of illuminating the geometry ( and so distinguishing between various ideas as to the underlying emission mechanisms ) but _ only _ with much more detailed modelling of the x  ray irradiated disk .",
