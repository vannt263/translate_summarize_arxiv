    "the interfacial free energy between ice and water , @xmath0 , is a crucial parameter in ice nucleation and growth @xcite . despite its importance",
    ", there is not yet a well established experimental value for @xmath0 .",
    "the spread of experimental data for @xmath0 , ranging from 25 to 35 mn / m @xcite , sharply contrasts with the accuracy with which the interfacial free energy of the liquid - vapour interface is known @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there is no accurate experimental technique for the determination of the crystal - melt interfacial free energy .    in order to aid experimentalists in finding a definite value for @xmath0 , guidance from computer simulation",
    "is highly valuable .",
    "however , there are not many studies devoted to the estimation of @xmath0 from simulations .",
    "recently , @xmath0 has been calculated for a series of water models with @xcite and without @xcite taking full electrostatic interactions into account . in these works ,",
    "a variant of the cleaving method @xcite was used to compute @xmath0 and the studied models were tip4p , tip4p - ew and tip5p - e .",
    "there are numerous water models currently available in the literature with which different predictions of the behaviour of real water can be made . in a recent work ,",
    "abascal and vega have compared the ability of many different rigid , non - polarizable models to predict a comprehensive set of real water properties .",
    "the tip4p/2005 model @xcite turned out to be the one that does the best job in the overall description of the behaviour of real water @xcite .",
    "therefore , estimating @xmath0 for such model would be highly relevant .",
    "in a recent publication by some of the authors of this work , @xmath0 was estimated for the tip4p/2005 model @xcite with a seeding method originally used by bai and li to study the crystal - melt interface of the the lennard - jones system @xcite .",
    "this method consists in measuring the critical size of crystalline clusters and then obtaining @xmath0 from classical nucleation theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , this method provides an indirect estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the method by bai and li does not provide information about the dependency of @xmath0 with the orientation of the crystal , since an orientationally averaged @xmath0 is obtained .",
    "in this paper we evaluate @xmath0 for the tip4p/2005 model by means of the capillary fluctuation method @xcite .",
    "this method has been used , for instance , for the calculation of the interfacial free energy of hard spheres @xcite , the lennard - jones @xcite and dipolar fluids @xcite . here",
    "we evaluate @xmath0 for the tip4p/2005 model for the basal , prismatic i and prismatic ii planes of ice .",
    "we find an average value of @xmath0 of 27(2 ) mn / m and a small anisotropy between different orientations .",
    "finally , we inspect the structure of the interface .",
    "we estimate the thickness of the interface to be of about 4 - 5 molecular diameters .",
    "moreover , we find that when the basal plane is exposed to the liquid the interface develops alternating hexagonal and cubic ice regions .",
    "we use the capillary fluctuation method @xcite to compute the interfacial free energy .",
    "the method consists in measuring @xmath0 by analysing the profile of the interface between ice and water under coexistence conditions . for the tip4p/2005 model",
    "the interface between ice and water is rough , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ caja ] , where particles in the ice phase are shown in orange and particles in the liquid phase are shown in blue .",
    "particles are labelled as ice or liquid - like based on local bond order parameters @xcite . by knowing which particles belong to each phase",
    ", one can establish a discretized interface profile along the @xmath1 direction , @xmath2 ( in ref .",
    "@xcite a detailed explanation of the way we establish @xmath2 is given ) .",
    "then , @xmath2 is fourier - transformed , @xmath3 and an amplitude , @xmath4 , is obtained for each wave vector , @xmath5 , where @xmath5 is a multiple of @xmath6 .",

    "is the number of discretization points along the @xmath8 side of the simulation box .    through the equipartition theorem ,",
    "capillary wave theory provides the following relation between @xmath4 and the interfacial stiffness , @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the interfacial area , ( see fig . [ caja ] ) .",
    "the calculated stiffness depends on the crystal plane that is exposed to the fluid and on the direction along which the wave propagates .",
    "the exposed crystal plane is perpendicular to the vector @xmath12 in fig .",
    "[ caja ] and it is identified by its miller indices .",
    "the direction of propagation of the wave is perpendicular to both @xmath12 and @xmath13 and it is specified by the miller indices of the plane perpendicular to @xmath13 .",
    "hence , @xmath14 .",
    "once the stiffness is known , we use the relation @xcite : @xmath15 to obtain the interfacial free energy . in the above expression @xmath16",

    "obtaining @xmath18 from eq .",
    "[ gammastiff ] requires first defining the dependence of the interfacial free energy with the orientation of the crystal , @xmath19 .",
    "since the point group of hexagonal ice is 6/@xmath20 , the orientation dependence of @xmath19 can be written as an expansion in terms of spherical harmonics @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the interfacial free energy averaged over all orientations , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the spherical angles defining a given plane ( see fig .",
    "[ sistema_hexagonal ] ) and @xmath25 are the anisotropy parameters .",
    "the functions @xmath26 are the normalized spherical harmonics , and they are provided in table [ spherical_harmonics ] . in table",

    "[ gammastiff ] an expansion of @xmath27 is obtained .",
    "such expansion is given in table [ expansion_stiff ] for all the orientations studied in this work .",
    "the equations in table [ expansion_stiff ] combined with the simulation results for @xmath27 allow for the calculation of @xmath28 and @xmath22 . with these",
    ", the interfacial free energy is obtained with the equations provided in table [ expresiones_gamma_hexagonal ] .    in summary",

    "[ fourier_transform ] by defining an interfacial profile , @xmath2 , for many independent configurations .",
    "then , @xmath29 is obtained by means of eq .",
    "[ eqstiffness ] .",
    "once @xmath9 has been calculated for different orientations we solve the system of equations given in table [ expansion_stiff ] to obtain @xmath22 and the anisotropy parameters @xmath28 .",
    "finally , we use the calculated @xmath22 and @xmath28 to obtain the interfacial free energy of each plane via the expressions given in table [ expresiones_gamma_hexagonal ] .",
    "determines the crystallographic plane exposed at the interface and it is characterized by the angles @xmath23 and @xmath24 . ]      to simulate our system we have employed the molecular dynamics package gromacs @xcite .",
    "production runs for a total time of @xmath30 were carried out in the nvt ensemble with the time step for the velocity - verlet integrator fixed to 0.003 ps , and snapshots were saved every 75 ps .",
    "the temperature was set to 248.5 k ( close to the reported melting temperature of the model @xcite ) and the density was fixed close to an average value between the coexistence densities at 1 bar of liquid water and ice - ih . at these thermodynamic conditions the interface fluctuates but",
    "the relative ice / water amount stays constant throughout the simulation .",
    "to fix the temperature we employed a velocity - rescale thermostat @xcite with a relaxation time of 2 ps .",
    ".system size for all ice - water orientations studied in this work . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]        in order to analyze the structure of the interface we measure the density profile along the @xmath31 direction , perpendicular to the interface .",
    "such a study must be taken with some caution , however .",
    "the width of the interface has an intrinsic contribution , that is characteristic of the substance studied , but also shows an additional capillary wave term , that depends logarithmically on the interface area.@xcite for that reason , average profiles extracted from a simulation are not strictly intrinsic properties of the substance , but also depend on the system dimensions . since the capillary roughening shows a logarithmic dependence on the lateral dimensions , however , the correction to the intrinsic contribution that is typical in a finite simulation box is quite small .",
    "be as it may , the results that are obtained set an upper bound for the intrinsic contribution .",
    "furthermore , since all faces studied have a rather similar lateral dimension , the comparison between different crystal orientations also remains meaningful despite the capillary wave roughening .    in fig .",
    "[ densprof ] the density is plotted along the @xmath31 direction for four different orientations corresponding to the basal plane and to both prismatic planes . as a consequence of the geometry of our simulations ( see fig .",
    "[ caja ] ) two interfaces can be observed for each system . to obtain these density profiles we use bins of 0.05 @xmath32 and average over a time gap of @xmath33 35 ns .",
    "using a small bin width allows us to observe the different crystal layers along the system .",
    "the horizontal dotted - dashed lines in fig . [ densprof ] correspond to the average bulk density of the fluid phase . as it should be , the density given by the profile coincides with the bulk density in the middle of the phase .",
    "profiles given in figs .",
    "[ densprof ] ( c ) and ( d ) correspond to two different wave propagation directions for the same interfacial plane ( the primary prismatic plane ) . as expected , both density profiles are equivalent .",
    "note that the profile corresponding to the basal plane ( fig .",
    "[ densprof ] ( a ) ) shows the twin peaks characteristic of hexagonal planes .",
    "the measure of the thickness of the interface is a somewhat arbitrary task since one has to establish a criterion to locate the interface borders . in order to determine these borders we consider that the interface begins when a density peak does not reach the 90% of the average peak height in the middle of the crystal slab , and that it ends when the density profile becomes flat .",
    "we show the interfacial borders thus obtained as dashed vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ densprof ] .",
    "we obtain an interfacial width of about 4 - 5 molecular diameters for all studied planes .",
    "these values are similar , but somewhat larger than the @xmath33 3 molecular diameters reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for another tip4p family model ( the tip4p ) and a different system size .",

    "the dashed black line represents the threshold used to distinguish solid from liquid - like particles @xmath35 and the dashed - dotted red line represents the threshold to discriminate between ice ic and ice ih @xmath36 . ]    as previously mentioned , in order to get an interface profile , @xmath2 , we first need to identify the molecules belonging to the ice phase .",
    "this is done by means of the @xmath37 order parameter proposed by lechner and dellago @xcite .",
    "the order parameter is a scalar number that is assigned to each molecule according to the degree of orientational order in its local environment . in fig .",
    "[ optimizacion - q6q4 ] we plot @xmath38 versus @xmath34 for 3600 bulk molecules of liquid water ( magenta ) , of ice - ih ( cyan ) and of ice - ic ( orange ) . clearly , @xmath38 is a good parameter to distinguish the fluid from either ice polymorph .",
    "the @xmath38 threshold we use for that purpose is @xmath39 ( horizontal dashed line in fig .",
    "[ optimizacion - q6q4 ] ) .",
    "thus , if a particle has a @xmath38 value larger than @xmath40 it is labelled as solid - like , and vice - versa . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ optimizacion - q6q4 ] , molecules belonging to ice - ih and ice - ic polymorphs can be distinguished with the @xmath34 order parameter with a threshold of @xmath41 ( vertical dashed - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ optimizacion - q6q4 ] ) .",
    "initially , the system is prepared by putting an ice - ih slab in contact with liquid water .",
    "therefore , by analysing the @xmath42 map of the initial configuration one would obtain points in the region of the pink and the cyan clouds of fig .",
    "[ optimizacion - q6q4 ] . at the end of the simulations all orientations where a prismatic plane is exposed",
    "only show these two clouds of points ( see fig .",
    "[ q6q4 ] a - d ) . therefore , there is only liquid and ice ih at the end of these simulations .",
    "however , the simulation where the basal plane is exposed to the liquid shows an extra cloud of points in the area corresponding to ice - ic ( fig .",
    "[ q6q4 ] e ) .",
    "this suggests that some molecules with ice - ic environment appear along the course of the simulation . to know where",
    "these molecules are located we plot in fig .",
    "[ hielo - ic ] ice molecules with @xmath43 in blue ( ice ih ) and with @xmath44 in red ( ice ic ) .",
    "clearly , thin ice - ic layers have developed on some regions of the ice - water interface . in ref .",
    "@xcite we show that the relaxation of crystal - fluid capillary waves is due to the continuous recrystallization and melting taking place at the interface .",
    "this relaxation mechanism allows for the epitaxial growth of ice ic on top of the underlying ice ih .",
    "the recrystallization / melting relaxation mechanism also explains our observation that the interfacial regions containing ice ih and ice ic dynamically change along the course of the simulation .",
    "the reason why this structural transformation is only present when the basal plane is exposed is that hexagonal and cubic ice differ in their stacking sequence along the direction perpendicular to the basal plane ( ice ic stacking is diamond - like , a , b , c , a , b , c , ... whereas ice ih is wurtzite - like , a , b , a , b , ... ) .",
    "therefore , when the basal plane is exposed an ic - stacking can grow on top of ice ih , but the same is not true for the prismatic planes . by analysing a set of over 300 configurations with the basal plane exposed",
    "we observe that about 60 % of the ice in contact with water is ic and the other 40 % is ice ih .",
    "this is not altogether unexpected , since , at least for the tip4p models , the free energy of ice ic is very similar to that of ice ih @xcite .",
    "accordingly , growth of regions of ice ic with a negligible bulk free energy penalty can be realized if the corresponding surface free energy of the newly formed ih - ic and ic - water interfaces is comparable to that of the bare ih - water interface .",
    "the phenomenon above described resembles preferential adsorption of a metastable phase , well known in a variety of systems,@xcite as well as in the ice - vapour interface , which is mediated by a thin water layer @xcite .",
    "however , in the case here studied ice - ic does not fully cover the interface but dynamically coexists at the interface with ice - ih .",
    "0.15    0.15    0.15    0.15    0.15        therefore , our simulations predict that both ice polymorphs live together in the interface at equilibrium .",
    "this is not the only situation in which hexagonal and cubic ice can be found in close contact : there is compelling experimental and simulation evidence that ice grows with a mixed ic - ih stacking from supercooled water @xcite or from vapour deposition @xcite .",
    "in this work we use the tip4p/2005 water model to study the ice - water interface by means of computer simulations .",
    "we simulate the ice - water interface under coexistence conditions and evaluate the interfacial stiffness and the interfacial free energy by measuring the spectrum of capillary fluctuations .",
    "we study different crystal orientations and wave propagation directions .",
    "the predictions we get from the tip4p/2005 model are the following :    * the orientationally averaged interfacial free energy is 27(2 ) mn / m , in fair agreement with that obtained by analysing , for the same model , the size of critical ice nuclei with classical nucleation theory @xcite .",
    "our value is also similar to that obtained for other tip4p family models by means of a cleaving methodology @xcite and is consistent with experimental estimates of the interfacial free energy that range from 25 to 35 mn / m @xcite .",
    "* we obtain an interfacial free energy of 27(2 ) , 28(2 ) , and 28(2 ) mn / m for the basal , primary prismatic and secondary prismatic planes respectively .",
    "the accuracy of our calculations is not enough to establish definite conclusions about the anisotropy of the interfacial free energy , but our results suggest , in accordance with predictions for other tip4p family models @xcite , that the basal plane has the lowest free energy . * by measuring the density along the direction perpendicular to the interface we estimate an upper bound for the width of the ice - water interface of @xmath33 4 - 5 molecular diameters , in fair agreement with the 3 molecular diameters obtained for the tip4p model @xcite . *",
    "the ice - water interface for the basal plane shows alternating ice - ih / ice - ic regions .",
    "these change dynamically due to capillary fluctuations .    in a future , it would be useful to explore how to improve the accuracy of the present methodology in order to capture the small anisotropy of the ice - water interfacial free energy .",
    "moreover , the study of other water models could improve our understanding on the ice - water interface .",
    "of particular interest is perhaps the tip4p / ice model @xcite , whose melting properties are close to those of real water .",
    "however , we do not expect large differences with the values reported here for the tip4p/2005 given the similarity between all tip4p family models studied so far ( tip4p , tip4p - ew and tip4p/2005 ) . on the other hand",
    ", it would be interesting to pursue a more quantitative analysis of the coexistence of cubic and hexagonal ice patches at the ice - water interface , like , e.g. , a characterization of the typical size and relaxation times of such regions .",
