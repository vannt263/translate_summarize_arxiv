    "proposals of future flavor factories  @xcite emphasize the need of very high luminosities .",
    "for instance , the new generation of b - factories  @xcite requires improvements up to two orders of magnitude above the performances of the pep - ii  @xcite and kek - b  @xcite  colliders . among the ideas currently being developed to achieve this ambitious physics - driven goal , the crab waist compensation scheme associated with large piwinski angle and low vertical beta function  @xcite is very promising .",
    "luminosities as high as @xmath1 could be reached with beam currents similar to those operated routinely in today s accelerators , which would also help keeping the background under control .",
    "in addition to being based on existing technologies , this scheme would significantly limit the power ( and hence the cost ) needed to run such a new machine .",
    "the da@xmath0ne  accelerator , located in the national laboratory of frascati ( infn ) and optimized for the production of @xmath2 mesons ( @xmath3 = 1020 mev ) at a high rate , has been modified in 2007 to test the crab waist sextupole compensation scheme  @xcite with the aim of reaching higher luminosity while controlling the background .",
    "after completion of this upgrade , operations restarted during winter 2007 - 2008 .    since 2000",
    ", da@xmath0ne  has been delivering  collisions to three experiments kloe  @xcite , finuda  @xcite and dear  @xcite , steadily improving performances in terms of luminosity , beam lifetimes and background .",
    "the best peak luminosity was @xmath4 with typical daily integrated luminosities of @xmath5 during the kloe run . according to calculations  @xcite",
    ", the modified interaction region should increase the luminosity by a factor 3 - 5 with respect to the previous colliding scheme .",
    "to identify such a significant gain , a luminosity measurement precise at the @xmath6 level is enough .",
    "on the other hand , real time and accurate information is required regardless of the machine conditions to allow the da@xmath0ne  operators to tune this new collider and to get relevant feedback for their optimization studies .",
    "some redundancy between the various measurements is also important , in order to fight transient backgrounds which could impact strongly a particular detector .",
    "parallel to the upgrade of the da@xmath0ne  interaction point 1 ( ip ) , the _ siddharta _  experiment ( silicon drift detector for hadronic atom research by timing application )  @xcite aiming at studying kaonic hydrogen and kaonic deuterium has been installed at the same location .",
    "the presence of this additional detector , whose operation requires a very good shielding against machine background , has consequences on the design and on the performances of the main luminometer .",
    "these are discussed in the following sections of this article . in principle , _ siddharta _  can also provide a luminosity measurement based on the counting of charged kaon pairs produced by the decay @xmath7 whose branching fraction is well - known .",
    "however , this method suffers from a few limitations : a low rate ( around 25  hz at a luminosity of @xmath8 ) ; the dependence on the exact center of mass ( cm ) energy because of the @xmath2 resonance lineshape ; the need to separate efficiently true kaons from minimum - ionizing particles , a background strongly machine - dependent ; a limited duty cycle for technical reasons .",
    "therefore , various independent luminosity - oriented detectors have been built around the ip and put in operation beginning of february 2008 with a threefold goal : to guarantee an accurate measurement of the absolute luminosity , to monitor the background levels and to provide powerful and fast diagnosis tools to improve the machine . in the following ,",
    "we describe the design , the construction and the operation of these detectors , such as the results achieved during the 2008 and 2009 da@xmath0ne  runs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : overview ] gives an overview of the processes used to measure the luminosity and presents the experimental setup .",
    "then , sections  [ sec : setup ] and  [ sec : daq ] describe in details the detectors and the trigger / data acquisition systems .",
    "the recorded bhabha events are characterized in section  [ sec : performances ] which also explains the procedure used to estimate and subtract online the background .",
    "section  [ sec : montecarlo ] deals with the monte - carlo  simulation which is crucial to convert bhabha event rate into absolute machine luminosity .",
    "validation studies based on data - monte - carlo  comparisons are provided in section  [ sec : valid ] where the systematic error to the luminosity measurements is also computed .",
    "experimental results are given in section  [ sec : results ] before we finally conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "since the early days of  colliders , well - known electromagnetic processes , such as bhabha scattering  @xcite or single and double  bremsstrahlung  @xcite , have been used to monitor and measure collider luminosity .",
    "the bhabha elastic scattering @xmath9 has a very clean signature of two back - to - back tracks , of energy equal or close to the beam energy ( 510  mev at da@xmath0ne  ) .",
    "the cross section @xmath10 of this process has a very steep dependence on the polar angle @xmath11 : @xmath12 .",
    "most bhabha events are produced at small polar angle , an area where focusing quadrupoles or other machine elements are generally located , which limits the measured event rate .",
    "nevertheless , bhabha scattering at large angle still produces a sizable counting rate which can be exploited to measure luminosity ; considering a polar angle range of 18@xmath13 - 27@xmath13 , the born cross - section of the process is as high as 5  @xmath14b .",
    "the @xmath15 ( single bremsstrahlung ) process has a cross section of 169  mb for photon energies above 10  mev , thus resulting in a very high counting rate .",
    "the photon undergoes a small angular deviation from the charged track original direction : 95@xmath16 of the signal is contained in a cone of 1.7  mrad aperture .",
    "moreover , its cross section depends only logarithmically on the cm energy and is therefore relatively independent of the actual machine parameters . on the other hand",
    ", it suffers heavily from background caused by particles interacting with the residual gas in the beam - pipe or lost by touschek effect  @xcite .",
    "achieving high luminosity is not enough : future uses of the crab waist scheme will depend on how well the backgrounds can be controlled in this configuration . for the da@xmath0ne  collider ,",
    "both the experimental machine - induced backgrounds and the beam lifetimes are dominated by the touschek effect due to the use of dense beams at relatively low energy .",
    "the coulomb scattering of charged particles in a stored bunch induces energy exchange between transverse and longitudinal motions .",
    "small transverse momentum fluctuations lead to larger longitudinal variations as the effect is amplified by the lorentz factor .",
    "off - momentum particles can then exceed the momentum acceptance given by the radio - frequency ( rf ) bucket , or they may hit the aperture when displaced by dispersion . in both cases",
    "they get lost .",
    "several studies have been performed to control and reduce the background induced by the touschek effect and to optimize the signal to noise ratio for all the experiments that have been running at da@xmath0ne .",
    "this has been achieved by adjusting optical parameters like the orbits at the ip or the strength of the machine sextupoles and by minimizing the radial beam size upstream from the interaction region ( ir ) . moreover , the insertion of a proper set of collimators ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : collimators ] ) , together with simulation - based tracking studies of touschek scattered particles  @xcite , have also helped reducing the background significantly .",
    "ne  main rings with the collimator locations shown by red and blue arrows for positrons and electrons , respectively .",
    "the ir collimators are located upstream of the ip while the other ones are in dispersive regions close to wigglers .",

    "this hardware modification is planned in the near future for the next kloe run . in the present setup , a very careful",
    "shielding has been designed to allow clean luminosity measurements and to increase the signal to noise ratio for the _ siddharta _  detector .",
    "in addition , lead shieldings have been added behind the ir collimators to stop as many secondaries as possible .      in the new da@xmath0ne  interaction scheme ,",
    "the two 510  mev beams collide with a total crossing angle of 50  mrad ( 25  mrad per beam ) . at the ip",
    ", both beams are pointing toward the inner part of the ring ; they are separated at 57  cm from the ip .",
    "two low-@xmath17 permanent quadrupole magnets , the qd0s , are located on each side of the ip before the common beam pipe gets split into two separate sections .",
    "the qd0 magnets are approximately cylindrical , with a length of 24  cm and a 10  cm radius .",

    "data are updated every 15 seconds via the da@xmath0ne  control system .",
    "in addition to the bhabha luminometer , two gamma monitors ( pbw0@xmath33 crystals ) are located 170  cm away from the ip on either side and measure the rate of single bremsstrahlung events .",
    "these detectors provide a fast feedback when the machine conditions change ; they have also been used to scan the beam profiles or to estimate the level of touschek background .",
    "a detailed description of these three systems ( the bhabha calorimeter , the gem trackers and the gamma monitors ) can be found in the following section .",
    "the bhabha calorimeter is divided into four modules ( two on each side of the ip ) which surround the permanent qd0 magnets   see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "its acceptance in polar angle starts at @xmath34 and goes up to about @xmath35 ; the angular upper bound depends on the exact _ siddharta _  shielding configuration but the shower containment is degrading quickly above this angle .",
    "the modules are segmented in five azimuthal sectors , each @xmath36 wide .",
    "the calorimeter design is driven by the need of having the main ir platform supporting its weight ( about 400  kg in total ) rather than the very fragile vacuum beam pipe .",
    "each arm is made of two pieces ( top and bottom halves ) with a light aluminum skeleton sandwiching a stronger structure located in the machine mid - plane .",
    "a fan - shaped hole leaves a large and well - defined fraction of the @xmath37 acceptance free of any passive material . to keep the mechanics simple ,",
    "the acceptance is covered by trapezoid ( instead of ring - shaped ) sectors . in the chosen design ,",
    "the supporting structure is made of two parts connected by a longitudinal bar , one of each side of the fan - shaped hole .",
    "when the two halves are put together , the four sectors corresponding to the @xmath38 region around the beam plane can not be instrumented   see fig .",
    "[ fig : ring ] .",
    "this is not a flaw in the design as most of the machine background is located in this area : should they have been included , these most - lateral sectors would have been copiously hit by spurious particles . having sectors @xmath36-wide in azimuth",
    "is a trade - off between the expected flexibility of the device ( in particular one wants to be able to exclude temporarily a well - defined part of the acceptance in case of shielding modifications or changes in the background conditions ) and the final number of channels to be instrumented .",
    "another major constraint of the calorimeter design is the presence around the ip of the _ siddharta _  detector and of its shielding .",
    "lead bricks are installed to stop as much radiation as possible before the particles enter the active part of the experiment . during the initial optimization phase , ( february - august 2008 )",
    "the shielding has been modified to improve the kaon to background ratio",
    ". the vertical position of this detector has also been tuned ( from 5 to 15  cm of the ip ) in the meantime . the final shape has been installed in september 2008 .",
    "each calorimeter sector is a sandwich of twelve trapezoidal 1  cm thick scintillator tiles , wrapped with tyvek  @xcite paper , alternated with eleven lead plates of variable thickness .",
    "starting from the face close to the ip , the eight first plates are 0.5  cm thick while the last three are 1  cm thick .",
    "hence the total thickness of the sector is 19  cm .",
    "this design is a compromise between the need of having a good longitudinal containment of the 510  mev charged particle showers ( the total depth corresponds to about 12.5 @xmath39 ) and the requirement of having a detector not exceeding the permanent quadrupole length   as some mechanical structures are located right behind these magnets .",
    "moreover , the further the calorimeter from the ip , the lower the polar angle up to which it is sensitive . finally , the free space between the calorimeter and _ siddharta _  is needed to accommodate the gem tracker which is described in the following .",
    "the two - hundred and forty scintillator tiles have been produced with injection - molded technique in ihep , protvino  @xcite .",
    "each tile has three , 2  mm deep , radial grooves on one face , ( one in the middle and two 1  cm away from the edge of the tile ) inside which wavelength shifting ( wls ) fibers  @xcite of 1  mm diameter are placed   see fig .",

    "each of the four gem trackers is segmented into thirty - two pads : four 6.5  mm - wide rings contain eight cells covering @xmath45 in azimuth each ; the ring boundaries are located at 68 , 74.5 , 81 , 87.5 and 94  mm respectively from the beam axis .",

    "the resolution can be estimated by subtracting the electron reconstructed azimuth @xmath2 from that of the positron . in the absence of boost , this quantity only differs from zero because of resolution effects .",

    "as expected , the latter is much less sensitive to backgrounds than the former : t1free exceeds significantly t2farm when either beam gets injected while the two curves agree almost perfectly when the beam currents are both very low . with currents around 2  amp for electrons and 1  amp for positrons ,",
    "the peak luminosity is routinely between 3.5 and @xmath100 .",
    "finally , the bottom plot shows the integrated t1free and t2farm luminosities . each step in the green curve corresponds to an injection period ; after two hours the disagreement can reach 30@xmath16 which explains why correcting the calorimeter rate was mandatory to get an accurate luminosity measurement .",

    "the saturation at high currents seen by the bhabha calorimeter is also present in other monitoring data which indicates that the limitation does stem from a beam size blow up and not from some background - induced pmt saturation preventing accurate luminosity measurements .",

    "one can also note that the luminosity per bunch is quite flat for all bunch patterns and does not really depend on the bunch position in the train , as expected for a well - behaving machine .",
    "obviously all fills are not as good as those exemplified in this section and so having the capability of making such diagnostics quickly helps a lot investigating issues which may involve the beam bunch patterns .",
    "two machine runs have been dedicated to the measurement of the gamma monitor rates in order to compare the actual numbers with those predicted by a full tracking simulation .",
    "the latter simulates the touschek scattering particles from their generation to their loss in the beam pipe ; secondary particles are then simulated and propagated through the ir up to the gamma monitors .",

    "for this second experiment a ten - bunch pattern was used for a total beam current of about 100  mamp and the optics were the same as for the high luminosity runs .",
    "in addition to the gamma monitor spectra , the beam lifetimes were also measured during the march run . this allows a more complete test of the simulation as its predictions regarding both the background rates and the beam lifetimes can be simultaneously compared with the da@xmath0ne  data .      the black triangles in fig .",

    ", these numbers have been corrected to take into account the coupling between the beams .",
    "although the agreement between simulation and measurements is not perfect , both sets of numbers appear to be in the right ballpark   actual rates also depend on various machine conditions which are not easy to reproduce nor to quantify .",
    "the resulting simulated touschek lifetime is as short as 840 s for a 0.5% beam coupling .",
    "this result is in agreement with measurements , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lifetime ] .",
