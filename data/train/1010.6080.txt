    "magnetoresistance oscillations caused by landau quantization provide important information about fundamental properties of electron system in solids .",
    "studies of the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations due to sequential passage of landau levels through the fermi level @xcite allow one to investigate the shape of the fermi surface as well as the scattering processes leading to landau level broadening . apart from sdh oscillations , there exist oscillating phenomena which are not related to the position of landau levels with respect to the fermi level and , therefore , are less sensitive to temperature .",
    "one of the most important examples of such phenomena are the magneto - intersubband ( mis ) oscillations @xcite observed in two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems with two or more populated dimensional - quantization subbands , which are realized in single , double , and triple quantum wells @xcite .",
    "recently , magento - oscillations driven by intersubband transitions have also been reported for 2d electrons on liquid helium @xcite .",
    "the peculiar magnetoresistance properties of 2d electron systems are caused by the possibility of elastic ( impurity - assisted ) scattering of electrons between the subbands .",
    "the mis oscillations occur because of a periodic modulation of the probability of intersubband transitions by the magnetic field .",
    "the maxima of these oscillations correspond to the condition when subband splitting energy @xmath0 is a multiple of the cyclotron energy @xmath1 , so the landau levels belonging to different subbands are aligned . since mis oscillations survive an increase in temperature , they are used to study electron scattering mechanisms at elevated temperatures when sdh oscillations completely disappear in the region of weak magnetic fields @xcite .    despite the fact that mis oscillations are one of the most fundamental manifestations of quantum magnetotransport ,",
    "their properties are not sufficiently studied . in particular , the case when one of the subbands is placed close to the fermi energy and its filling by electrons is very small deserves a closer attention .",
    "theoretical studies @xcite confirmed that mis oscillations can exist at such small fillings of the upper subband , but a detailed experimental investigation of this",
    "interesting situation is still missing . from the theoretical point of view , it is important to consider scattering mechanisms of electrons near the edge of the weakly populated subband and a possibility of probing these mechanisms by magnetoresistance measurements .",
    "we have studied magnetoresistance in symmatric gaas wide quantum wells ( wqws ) with high - mobility 2d electron gas .",
    "owing to a high electron density and a large well width , these systems form a bilayer configuration due to charge redistribution , when two quantum wells near the interfaces are separated by an electrostatic potential barrier ( see fig .",
    "the presence of the two occupied subbands is confirmed by the observation of mis oscillations in magnetoresistance .",
    "apart from mis and sdh oscillations , we observe unusual oscillations which appear when temperature is raised to 10  k and persist up to @xmath2  k in the region of magnetic fields from 0.35 to 2  t. the period of these oscillations is slightly smaller than the period of sdh oscillations .",
    "the dependence of resistivity on magnetic field and temperature allows us to treat these small - period oscillations as the mis oscillations caused by electron scattering between the two lowest subbands and the third subband which is placed slightly above the fermi energy @xmath3 ( fig . 1 ) and becomes populated as a result of thermal activation .",
    "this conclusion is supported by a theoretical consideration of magnetoresistance , which also uncovers the scattering mechanism responsible for landau level broadening and thereby explains the unusual low sensitivity of the small - period mis oscillations to thermal suppression at elevated temperatures .",

    "we identify these oscillations as mis oscillations associated with the third subband.,width=355 ]    the main results for the magnetoresistance are summarized in fig . 2 .",
    "several groups of quantum oscillations , periodic with the inverse magnetic field , are observed . at low temperatures we see",
    "both sdh ( small - period ) and mis ( large - period ) oscillations , the latter are caused by electron scattering between the two lowest subbands .",
    "sdh oscillations are visible at 4.2  k in the region of magnetic fields above 0.6  t. in this region , sdh oscillations are superimposed on the first mis peak whose maximum is placed at @xmath15  t corresponding to the alignment condition @xmath16 . with increasing temperature , the sdh oscillations are rapidly damped and disappear .",
    "disapperance of sdh oscillations for @xmath17  k and in the range of magnetic fields studied in the present work can be easily confirmed applying the well - known lifshitz - kosevich formula containing the specific thermal damping factor @xmath18 .",
    "however , another oscillating pattern is developed at @xmath19  k and persists even at @xmath20  k , when large - period mis oscillations are strongly damped .",
    "the period of these high - temperature oscillations is close to the sdh oscillation period but does not coincide with it .",
    "for example , the sdh peak at @xmath15 t appears to be in phase with the high - temperature oscillations ( arrow p in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , while the sdh peak at @xmath21 t stays in antiphase ( arrow ap in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . at @xmath22 t ,",
    "the high - temperature oscillations replace sdh oscillations in the interval from @xmath23 to @xmath24 k. as seen from the plots for 10 , 15 , and 20  k , the high - temperature oscillations also exist in the region of lower magnetic fields corresponding to the second mis peak .",
    "( color online ) temperature dependence of the amplitudes of small - period ( squares ) and large - period ( circles ) mis oscillations .",
    "the solid lines are the results of theoretical calculation ( see sec .",
    "iii for details ) . ]    therefore , the nature of the small - period high - temperature oscillations is obviously different from the nature of sdh oscillations .",
    "the origin of these oscillations can be understood if the third subband in our quantum well is included into consideration . indeed",
    ", numerical calculations of wqw energy spectrum show that at @xmath25 the third subband should be weakly populated at the given electron density .",
    "the fact that we do not observe the effects associated with the third subband at low temperatures indicates a possible error within a few mev in theoretical determination of the position of this subband .",
    "if we assume that the third subband is placed slightly above the fermi energy ( @xmath26 ) and attribute the small - period oscillations to mis oscillations owing to electron transitions between this subband and the subbands 1 and 2 , the observed properties of these oscillations become clear .",
    "first , the periodicity in this case is determined by the large splitting energies @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which also explains a slightly smaller period of these oscillations compared to sdh oscillations .",
    "next , the thermal activation behavior is explained by the increasing number of electrons being able to participate in the intersubband transitions with increasing temperature .",
    "finally , the persistence of the oscillations at high temperatures follows from their nature : a suppression of mis oscillations with temperature is not related to thermal smearing of the fermi surface but is caused by thermal broadening of landau levels .",
    "however , by comparing the slopes of high - temperature suppression of small - period and large - period mis oscillation amplitudes in fig . 3 at the same magnetic field ( 0.41 t ) , it is evident that the small - period oscillations are more robust with respect to increasing temperature .",
    "this interesting and unexpected result may indicate a weaker temperature dependence of the landau level broadening in the third subband compared to subbands 1 and 2 .",
    "such an assumption is confirmed by theoretical calculations .",
    "the theoretical analysis carried out in the next section demonstrates that the consideration of electron scattering near the edge of the third subband explains the whole set of the data obtained in our magnetoresistance measurements .",
    "in the experimentally relevant range of transverse magnetic fields , when the number of landau levels below the fermi energy is large , the electron transport in 2d systems is conveniently described by using either a quantum boltzmann equation or kubo formalism based on treatment of electron scattering within the self - consistent born approximation @xcite .",
    "these methods are straightforwardly generalized for many - subband systems @xcite . by considering the elastic scattering of electrons in the limit of classically strong magnetic fields ( when @xmath40 is much larger than transport scattering rates ) , one can express the linear dissipative resistivity of the electron system with several occupied 2d subbands in the following way @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the effective electron mass , @xmath43 is the electron charge , @xmath44 is the subband index , @xmath45 is the electron wave number in the subband @xmath44 , @xmath46 is the subband energy , @xmath47 is the equilibrium ( fermi - dirac ) distribution function of electrons , and @xmath48 is the dimensionless ( normalized to its zero - field value @xmath49 ) density of electron states in the subband @xmath44 .",

    "can be neglected within the interval of thermal smearing of the electron distribution .",

    "although this equality is based on a tight - binding description of the double - layer system , is holds with good accuracy in our wqws , as confirmed by calculations of the wave functions for the first and second subband .",
    "thus , in the case of closely spaced first and second subbands ( @xmath63 ) , the intrasubband and intersubband rates are almost equal , so we use @xmath64 .",

    "the third - subband contribution is not essential at low temperatures , when @xmath77 is negligible at @xmath78 .",

    "to describe the small - period mis oscillations , it is crucial to consider the density of states in the third subband by focusing on the scattering mechanisms which are responsible for its broadening and temperature dependence . the density of states @xmath48 for subband @xmath44 can be found from the general expression @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the advanced ( index a ) green s function for the electron in subband @xmath44 in the landau - level representation and @xmath81 is the corresponding self - energy .",

    "<S> these small - period oscillations are less sensitive to thermal suppression than the large - period magneto - intersubband oscillations caused by the scattering between the first and the second subbands . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical study , based on consideration of electron scattering near the edge of the third subband , gives a reasonable explanation of our experimental findings . </S>"
