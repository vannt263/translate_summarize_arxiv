    "cavitation in liquids is a common phenomenon that has been observed and used in a wide range of fields including mechanical and chemical engineering and nuclear and medical applications.@xcite when cavitation occurs in a liquid under negative pressure , many gas or vapor bubbles emerge and explosively expand .",
    "the cavitation bubbles then collapse violently after the negative pressure is released , emitting high - speed liquid jets and/or shock waves .",
    "because of its practical importance and rich physics , cavitation has long been studied after the pioneering work by rayleigh.@xcite however , cavitation is not yet fully understood , and there remain many unclear aspects of even its fundamental characteristics , such as the inception processes , threshold pressures at which cavitation occurs , and lifetime of emerged bubbles.@xcite    one of the key factors in cavitation bubble dynamics is bubble - bubble interaction .",
    "it has long been known that , when bubbles interact with each other , their dynamics are sometimes significantly different from that of isolated bubbles . in ref .",
    ", for example , smith and mesler studied experimentally the dynamics of a spark - generated vapor bubble interacting with a gas bubble in an effort to search for a method to reduce cavitation damage .",
    "they demonstrated that energy transfer between the bubbles alters their dynamics , and that positive pressure pulses emitted by the collapsing vapor bubble are reduced when the gas bubble stays near the vapor bubble . in ref .",
    ", mrch studied the collapse of cavitation bubble clusters using an energy - balance equation and found that the collapse intensity depends on the volume fraction of bubbles .",
    "he also studied experimentally the temperature dependence of cavitation bubble dynamics and showed that the number of cavitation bubbles increases but their size decreases as the liquid temperature increases . using a detailed theoretical model ,",
    "chahine and liu@xcite studied the growth of a vapor bubble cluster in a superheated liquid , and found that the expansion rate of bubbles and the temperature drop at the bubble surface decrease as the number of interacting bubbles increases . in a numerical study of shock - wave propagation in a bubble cloud ,",
    "wang and brennen@xcite showed that the expansion rate of bubbles at the cloud center is significantly smaller that that on the cloud surface . in a study of multibubble sonoluminescence , mettin _",
    "et al_.@xcite showed numerically that in a strong acoustic field , the sign of the secondary bjerknes force ( an interaction force acting between pulsating bubbles ) depends in a complicated manner on the driving pressure , ambient radii of bubbles , and inter - bubble distance .",
    "in this paper we examined the inception processes of cavitation in water in multibubble cases or , in other words , multi - nuclei cases .",
    "the present study was motivated by a recent numerical study of cavitation in liquid mercury and a technique to suppress it .",
    "et al_.@xcite showed numerically that bubble - bubble interaction through pressure waves can have a significant impact on the inception of cavitation . using a nonlinear multibubble model based on the keller - miksis equation",
    ", it was found that in certain situations , the explosive expansion of a bubble ( i.e. , cavitation inception ) is completely suppressed by the positive pressure waves that larger neighboring bubbles emit when they are growing .",
    "this theoretical prediction was confirmed by an experiment , the results of which showed that microbubble injection into liquid mercury suppresses cavitation inception and significantly reduces cavitation damage.@xcite this finding implies that the inception processes of cavitation in multibubble cases can be significantly different from that in single - bubble cases .",
    "we present in this paper a detailed discussion of the effect of bubble - bubble interaction on cavitation inception in water .",
    "the theoretical model used in this study is a nonlinear multibubble model in which rayleigh - plesset equations for single bubbles are coupled through an interaction term that represents the bubble - emitted pressure waves . from a number of relevant nonlinear models@xcite we select the classical rayleigh - plesset equations , which are for gas bubbles in an incompressible liquid , coupled through an acoustic interaction term not taking into account time delay effects due to the finite sound speed of water .",
    "the time history of the far - field liquid pressure is assumed to be a constant negative pressure following a sinusoidal decompression . when the period of the decompression process is set to zero",
    ", this pressure - time history is reduced to a step change that has been frequently considered in cavitation study .",
    "based on the model and setting , we first consider the interaction of two non - identical bubbles under negative pressure .",
    "the numerical results suggest that the suppression of cavitation inception reported in ref .   can occur in water as well if the bubbles ambient radii and inter - bubble distance are properly set .",
    "then , we discuss several details of the results .",
    "particular attention is focused on the effective cavitation pressure ( a dynamic blake threshold ) of the suppressed bubble and the transition region in parameter space where the bubble s behavior drastically changes as , for example , the inter - bubble distance changes .",
    "we also discuss the dynamics of larger numbers of identical bubbles to show that they have a stronger suppression effect . in this discussion",
    ", we derive an exact theoretical formula that relates the surface velocity of interacting bubbles to their instantaneous radii .",
    "the theoretical formula is a direct extension of the single - bubble formula derived previously@xcite and has high accuracy and wide applicability . using the formula",
    "we discuss how bubble - bubble interaction changes the expansion rate of bubbles and the negative pressure amplitude in water .",
    "the obtained conclusions are consistent with previous numerical and experimental observations . in the present investigation we found that the inception process of cavitation in multibubble cases can be much more complex than in single - bubble cases and that a variety of patterns of inception are possible .",

    "one of the well - known notions of cavitation in single - bubble cases ( called hereafter single - bubble cavitation ) in quasistatic cases is the blake threshold ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) . for liquid pressures below a threshold value , a gas bubble ( cavitation nucleus ) does not have an equilibrium radius and",

    "the threshold pressure , determined from @xmath19 , is @xmath20 and the corresponding critical radius is @xmath21    when @xmath5 slowly decreases and exceeds @xmath7 , the bubble begins to explosively expand .",
