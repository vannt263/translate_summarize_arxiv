    "the pure - leptonic decays of heavy mesons are very interesting from the point of not only theoretical but also experimental view @xcite . in principle , the pure - leptonic decays @xmath6 can be used to determine the decay constant @xmath5 .",
    "it is also discussed that the pure - leptonic decays of @xmath7 meson may be sensitive to new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) at tree level @xcite . based on the estimates in @xcite , except at tevatron , numerous @xmath7",
    "mesons are hard to be produced in the current colliders , whereas at lhc a great number of @xmath7 mesons , e.g. @xmath8 , may be produced .",
    "thus we may expect that careful experimental studies on the @xmath7 meson will be able to be accessible in the foreseeable future .",
    "in addition , the @xmath7 meson decay channels can also contribute some background for probing @xmath9 decays with the same final states @xcite , thus , it makes an ` extra ' reason to study these decay channels of the @xmath7 meson precisely .",
    "the decays of pseudoscalar mesons into light lepton pairs are helicity suppressed , i.e. their decay widths are suppressed by @xmath10 : @xmath11 thus it is hard to collect enough events of the pure - leptonic decays i.e. it is very difficult to obtain very good statistics for the decays , so that it makes very difficult to determine the decay constant @xmath5 from these processes . in sm ,",
    "only the decay @xmath12 does not suffer so much from this suppression and the branching ratio can be about 1.5% @xcite .",
    "however the produced @xmath13 decays promptly and at least one more neutrino is generated when the cascade decay is taken into account , thus this decay channel is difficult to be identified . the experimental efficiency should be discussed in connection with a specific detector if one insists on using the @xmath13 leptonic decay for the purpose to determine the decay constant @xmath5 .    in the present work , we will study the processes @xmath14 within sm and with the effective lagrangian for the heavy flavour decays . in the following section we will analyze @xmath14 in the framework of a constituent quark model .",
    "finally we will discuss the obtained results briefly in the last section .",
    "because of the lightness of the leptons @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the processes @xmath17 are suppressed much by the helicity factor @xmath18 as in eqn.(1 ) . if an additional photon line is attached to any of the charged lines of the feynman diagrams for the pure - leptonic decays as done in fig.1 , i.e. the pure - leptonic processes change into the corresponding radiative ones .",
    "the situation will be different : now no helicity suppression exists any more , but there will be an additional @xmath19 ( the electro - magnetic coupling constant ) suppression instead . to the radiative decays there are four tree diagrams to contribute , as shown in fig .",
    "it is easy to see that the fourth diagram ( fig.1d ) , in which the photon is emitted from the w boson , is suppressed further by a factor of @xmath20 , if comparing it with the other three diagrams .",
    "thus we neglect it for simplicity . to be consistent , in the following calculations we will neglect all the terms suppressed by this factor @xmath20 .",
    "it is easy to check that the total amplitudes is gauge invariant at this accuracy .",
    "hence to the accuracy , the amplitudes corresponding to the other three diagrams turn out to be @xmath21 b ~(\\bar \\ell \\gamma ^\\mu p_l \\nu ) , \\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal h}_{c } & = & -i \\sqrt{2 } g_f e   v_{cb } ( \\bar c \\gamma",

    "\\label{h4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to be at the `` quark level '' , the amplitudes given in eqn.([h4 ] ) are not sufficient enough to analyze the processes @xmath22 , indeed at least a model is needed to ` turn ' the amplitudes into the ` hadronic level ' . here for the aim we adopt a simple constituent quark model ( see , for example @xcite ) . in this model both of the quark and anti - quark inside the meson are treated non - relativistically moving with the same velocity and the quark masses are the constituent masses . in the constituent quark model",
    ", we have @xmath23    we use further the interpolating field technique @xcite which relates the hadronic matrix elements to the decay constants of the mesons in the present case . with the decay constant definition : @xmath24 the whole amplitude for @xmath22 decay is derived from eqn .",
    "( [ h4],[s2 ] ) : @xmath25 ( \\bar \\ell \\gamma",
    "^\\mu p_l \\nu).\\label{5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note once again that in the above calculations , all the terms suppressed by the factor of @xmath26 have been neglected .",
    "it is easily seen that the eqn.([5 ] ) is explicitly gauge invariant . neglecting the mass of the lepton",
    ", we get the differential decay width : @xmath27   , \\label{6}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 the @xmath29 , @xmath30 are defined as @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "hence the decay width is : @xmath33 .",
    "\\label{7}\\ ] ] using @xmath34 , @xmath35 @xcite , @xmath36 gev , @xmath37 gev @xcite , we obtain @xmath38 if the lifetime is taken as @xmath39 @xcite , and the decay constant is used as @xmath40mev @xcite , the branching ratio is found to be @xmath41 .    since it is helpful for experiments to detect this decay channel , it is also useful to consider the differential spectra .",
    "the photon energy spectrum is easily derived from eqn.([6 ] ) : @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "we show the photon energy spectrum in fig.2 as the solid line .",
    "this is clearly different from the bremsstrahlung photon spectrum , but the same with @xmath44 decay photon spectrum @xcite .      to show the distributions more clearly",
    ", we present @xmath52 in fig.2(a ) as solid , dashed and dash - dotted lines . in @xmath44 decay , since the lightness of the u quark , @xmath53 , the energy spectra for charged lepton and neutrino are kept only the @xmath50 terms in ( [ en],[el ] ) .",
    "they are shown in fig.2(b ) correspondingly .",
    "the behavior is similar , but the endpoint at @xmath54 is different 2e for @xmath55 , @xmath56 while for @xmath57 , @xmath58    for comparison , the pure - leptonic decay branching ratios are also given with the same parameters as the radiative ones : @xmath59 it is easy to see that the branching ratios of the radiative leptonic decay and the pure - leptonic decay for the muon are at the same order .",
    "one may see from eqn.([7 ] ) that the decay rate of @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath61 , so one may use it to measure the decay constant @xmath62 .",
    "we should note here that the decay rate eqn.([7 ] ) is model - dependent , because the ` hadronic piece ' in the calculations is model dependent i.e. the non - relativistic constituent quark model is used .",
    "however , unlike the @xmath63 decays , here b and c quarks are both heavy .",
    "the long distance contributions can be controlled by the factor of @xmath64 or @xmath65 thus they will be able to estimate theoretically @xcite . therefore to determine the decay constance @xmath5 from the measurements with our formula is still promised .",
    "the similar decays , @xmath44 , have been calculated by many authors @xcite .",
    "the decay width has been shown in constituent quark model to be @xmath66 where @xmath67mev is the constituent quark mass of u - quark . to compare the importance of the @xmath22 and that of the decay @xmath44 , let us present the relative fraction of @xmath68 final states coming from different sources @xmath7 and @xmath69 in a high energy production process : @xmath70 \\frac{m_u^2 } { m_{b_u}^2 } , \\label{ncu}\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath71 , @xmath72 are the inclusive probability that a b - quark hadronizes into a @xmath7 meson and a @xmath69 meson respectively . the @xmath71 is estimated to be a small number of the order 0.1% , and the probability @xmath72 is known at lep with good accuracy @xcite : @xmath73 using the central values of all parameters , one obtains @xmath74 this means that the @xmath68 final states coming from @xmath7 and @xmath69 are at the same order .",
    "we expect a similar fraction will also be obtained at lhc .",
    "if one would like to use the radiative decays to determine the decay constant @xmath75 ( or @xmath5 ) , the background from the corresponding decays of the meson @xmath7 ( or @xmath69 ) should be considered very carefully . in b factories at kek and slac , there will be no such problem , since @xmath7 can not be produced there .",
    "the energy spectra of the lepton and neutrino for @xmath7 decays in fig.2 have been emphasized to be different from that for the @xmath69 decays @xcite .",
    "this will be a good feature for experiments to distinguish the radiative decays of @xmath7 from that of @xmath69 meson .    in conclusion",
    ", we predict the branching ratios for @xmath76 in sm at the order of @xmath2 . with this branching ratio ,",
    "they are hopeful detectable at tevatron and lhc . when enough @xmath7 meson events are collected , the radiative decays will be able to provide alternate channels for measuring and/or ` cross - checking ' the decay constant @xmath5 independently with certain accuracy , provided that the background from @xmath69 decays is treated well . to enhance the accuracy of the theoretical predictions , or to estimate theoretical uncertainty of the calculations , various calculations on the @xmath7 radiative decay with different models",
    "are needed @xcite .",
