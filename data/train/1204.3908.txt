    "the nuclei of many galaxies exhibit emission lines characteristic of photoionization , both from hot stars and non - thermal continua . in a subset ,",
    "the emission lines exhibit a range of ionization states and line widths uncharacteristic of normal or starburst galaxies .",
    "these agn include objects classified as seyfert galaxies , quasars ( quasi - stellar radio galaxies ) , and qsos ( quasi - stellar objects ) .",
    "their emission lines are believed to be produced by a photoionizing continuum extending from the extreme - ultraviolet to the x - ray , which may be produced by an accretion disk around the black hole and by relativistic electrons , involving synchrotron emission and compton scattering .",
    "the ionizing spectrum extends to energies well beyond the hydrogen edge ( @xmath22  ryd ) , in order to produce strong emission lines ( krolik & kallman 1988 ) from high ions such as   ( 2.46 ryd ) ,  ( 3.51 ryd ) ,  ( 4.00 ryd ) ,  ( 5.69 ryd ) , and  ( 8.37 ryd ) .",
    "although agn are observed over a wide variety of luminosities and physical circumstances ( mass , viewing angle , accretion rate ) , they display a consistent _ mean _ spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the uv - optical .",
    "individual sources exhibit considerable variations in the far ultraviolet ( fuv , 10002000   ) and extreme ultraviolet ( euv , @xmath23   ) , with observed flux distributions fitted to power laws , @xmath24 and @xmath14 , where @xmath25 .",

    "2004 ) found a harder composite spectrum with @xmath33 and suggested that the difference may reflect a luminosity dependence through the well - known anti - correlation ( baldwin effect ) between emission - line strength and agn luminosity .",
    "the difference could also arise from the small numbers of targets observed by the different instruments ; fewer than 10 agn observations cover the spectral range @xmath34   . in all of these studies ,",

    "each sight line was observed with four or more exposures in both the g130 m and g160 m gratings .",
    "the central wavelengths were shifted between exposures to dither instrumental features in wavelength space and to provide a continuous spectrum over the entire fuv spectral range .",
    "individual exposures for each sight line were retrieved from the multi - mission archive for space telescope ( mast ) processed with the default calcos reduction pipeline .",
    "alignment and coaddition of the individual exposures was carried out using idl routines developed by the cos gto team specifically for fuv spectra ( idl routines are available at . )",
    "danforth et al .",
    "( 2010 ) describe the process in detail ; the only significant difference is our omission of the pseudo flatfielding procedure from that paper . a similar procedure is now included in the standard calcos reduction .",
    "data coalignment was achieved with strong interstellar features in each exposure , cross - correlated and interpolated onto a common wavelength scale .",
    "the wavelength shifts were typically on the order of a resolution element ( @xmath43   ) or less . the coadded flux at each wavelength was taken to be the exposure - weighted mean of flux in each aligned exposure .",
    "exposure times at the edges of detector segments were adjusted downward to underweight these regions .      here , we discuss how we aligned the fluxes , dealt with detector gaps , dereddening , lyman - limit systems , cosmological factors in rest - frame wavelength and specific flux , and other technical issues .",
    "we then provide details of how we constructed the composite spectra , with brief discussion of the order of adding spectra and choosing wavelength - pivot points . to combine the non - simultaneous observations from _ fuse",
    "hst_/cos , and _ iue _ , we scale the flux within the regions of spectral overlap to agreement .",

    "iue_-swp and _ iue_-lwr fluxes appear consistent and are not scaled to each other . scaling factors for the _ iue_-to - cos spectra range from 0.64 to 2.07 with an average of 1.13 , and for the _ fuse_-to - cos data from 0.35 to 1.38 with an average of 0.90 .",
    "source variability could affect the absolute flux and shape of agn seds in the ultraviolet .",
    "for example , iue - agn variability campaigns found that the uv continua hardened as the flux increased for the seyfert galaxies ngc4151 ( crenshaw et  al .",
    "1996 ; edelson et  al .",
    "1996 ) , ngc  5548 ( clavel et  al .  1991 ) , and ngc  3783 ( reichert et  al .  1994 ) . for fairall  9 ( rodriguez - pascual et  al .",
    "1997 ) and ngc  3516 ( edelson et  al .",
    "2000 ) there was no significant change in the relative fuv flux .",
    "determining the actual shape of the underlying uv continuum was challenging in these studies , owing to spectral dilution by the   pseudo - continuum ( nuv ) and difficulty finding line - free continuum windows .",
    "the combination of recent and archival data could make our seds vulnerable to this effect .",
    "however , because we primarily use coeval cos data to measure the slope of the continuum , our scaling should not greatly influence the result .    as noted earlier , several of our seyferts and agn show outflows and intrinsic absorption common in seyfert galaxies and qsos ( crenshaw et  al .",
    "2003 ) . in the seven low-@xmath28 targets ( @xmath47 ) the  line provides the best indicator of such outflows ( mrk  817 , mrk  290 , ngc  1513 , pg  1115 + 407 ) . at higher redshift ,  shifts out of the cos bands , but one can use  @xmath6 as an indicator ( e.g. , he  0153 - 4520 , he  0226 - 4110 , he  1102 + 3441 ) . for the highest - redshift agn , one can use  @xmath48770 , 780 to probe outflows . for our continuum",
    "fitting , we are able to fit out all the absorbers : intrinsic systems as well as interstellar and intergalactic lines .",
    "this capability is made possible by the high - s / n and high - resolution of cos .",
    "we also mask out galactic ly@xmath1   absorption ( 1215.67   ) and the geocoronal emission line of  @xmath49 in every spectrum .",
    "we correct the spectra for galactic reddening , using the empirical mean extinction curve of fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) with a ratio of total - to - selective extinction @xmath50 and color excesses @xmath51 from ned based on dust mapping by schlegel et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) . for our purposes , this extinction curve is extrapolated down to 1000   .",
    "if we use the extinction curve of cardelli et  al .",
    "( 1989 ) , the spectral index changes by only @xmath52 .",
    "we inspect the spectra for absorption from lyman limit systems ( lls ) and partial lls by identifying many lyman lines that are blueshifted from galactic absorption .",
    "table 2 shows the strengths ( column densities @xmath53 ) and redshifts of 17 lls found toward 8 agn in our sample .",
    "we account for lyman continuum absorption by correcting for the @xmath54 opacity shortward of each lyman edge using the optical depth , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the median flux of the pixels just blueward of the break and @xmath57 is the median flux of the pixels in selected windows longward of the break .",
    "we have used the restored continua in all cases except for the strong lls toward sbs1108 + 560 ( @xmath58 ) , for which we ignore the spectrum below 755    ( rest frame ) .",
    "finally , we apply redshift corrections to shift each spectrum to the agn rest frame by dividing the wavelengths by @xmath59 .",
    "we use the idl routine mpfit to fit the continuum of each spectrum with a power law of form , @xmath60 , with spectral indices , @xmath61 , listed in table  1 . because of",
    "the strong emission lines commonly seen in agn spectra , finding windows of completely uncontaminated continuum can be difficult .",
    "we focus on wavelength regions with the lowest relative flux ( local minima ) that appear to be free of emission lines .",
    "we avoid the prominent emission from ly@xmath1  @xmath2 and the doublets of  @xmath62 ,  @xmath63 ,  @xmath64 , and   @xmath65 .",
    "the  lines are typically blended with ] @xmath66 , and the  lines with ly@xmath67  @xmath68 .",
    "we also detect a number of weaker lines , known from atomic data and clearly seen in figure 2 in high - s / n spectra of mrk  817 and mrk  1513 .",

    "these features appear at the expected wavelengths , although in some cases residual flux from these blends appears as a pseudo - continuum .",
    "the high resolution of ( @xmath76  km  s@xmath41 ) and sensitivity of cos ( s / n listed in table 1 ) allow us to exclude many absorption lines from the galactic interstellar medium and igm .",
