    "in reference @xcite , hereafter referred to as i , a many - body theory of degenerate or quasidegenerate systems was presented , using quantum group methods . in particular , a hierarchy of green function was derived and formulated in terms of reduced coproducts . in this paper , the general formula is written explicitly in terms of green functions and feynman diagrams .",
    "the case we consider is that of a system with closed shells and a two - fold degenerate level occupied by a single electron . this does not look like a very interesting example , but we shall see that the hierarchy involves @xmath0-body green functions with @xmath0 up to 5 . in the general case of a @xmath1-fold degenerate level , the green functions involved go up to @xmath2 . in practice ,",
    "such complicated green functions are not usable , and the hierarchy is stopped after the first terms .",
    "the hierarchy we give here contains the first terms of the general hierarchy .",
    "quantum group concepts are not ( yet ) familiar in solid - state physics , so the pace will be slow and the calculations will be presented in full detail .",
    "the simplest case is one electron ( @xmath4 ) in a twofold degenerate level ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the two degenerate levels are denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the density matrix is @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "the moment generating function @xmath10 is defined in equation ( [ rho(baraalpha ) ] ) of i. in our case , @xmath4 and @xmath11 . according to equation ( [ rhon ] ) of i ( with @xmath4 , @xmath12 or @xmath7 , @xmath13 or @xmath7 ) @xmath14 using now equation ( [ rhok ] ) of i with @xmath15 we obtain @xmath16 according to equation ( [ rhoc(baraalpha ) ] ) of i , the cumulant generating function @xmath17 is obtained from @xmath18 where @xmath19 according to equation ( [ wrho0fin ] ) of i , this enables us to calculate @xmath20 .",
    "but we saw in section [ w0w1 ] of i that @xmath21 , thus @xmath22 with @xmath23 where @xmath24 the expression for the @xmath25 matrix @xmath26 is given in equation ( [ freegreen ] ) of i.    for later convenience , we give the identities @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29",
    "for one electron in a two - fold degenerate state , equation ( [ reduit ] ) of i stops at @xmath30 because @xmath5 and we have @xmath31 to obtain the green function , we put @xmath32 , we make a functional derivative with respect to @xmath33 and we set all fermion sources to zero ( in particular , this implies @xmath34 ) .",
    "we use also the fact that a functional derivative of @xmath35 or @xmath3 with respect to an odd number of fermion sources is zero if the sources are set to zero .",
    "this enables us to calculate the signs @xmath36 . @xmath37      the non - relativistic interacting hamiltonian is @xmath38 to simplify the notation",
    ", we define @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , so that @xmath42 to define the interacting operator @xmath43 ( i.e. the functional differential form of @xmath44 ) , we make the substitutions @xmath45 and @xmath46 and we use the simplified notation @xmath47 this gives us @xmath48 with @xmath49 thus @xmath50 to further simplify the notation , we replace @xmath51 by @xmath52 and @xmath53 by @xmath6 and @xmath54 by @xmath55 .",
    "the interacting operator becomes @xmath56    to calculate the coproduct of @xmath43 , we start from the coproduct of the basic functional derivatives @xmath57 then we use equation ( [ deltadd ] ) of i to calculate the coproduct of @xmath58 and @xmath59 : @xmath60 we use equation ( [ deltadd ] ) of i again to obtain @xmath61 the reduced coproduct with respect to @xmath43 is obtained by its definition @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , @xmath63 notice that , in @xmath64 , each term @xmath65 or @xmath66 contains between one and three functional derivatives .",
    "now we are going to examine each term of equation ( [ reduit2 ] ) .",
    "we define the @xmath0-body green function as @xmath67 the right hand side is taken at zero external sources . to simplify the notation ,",
    "we write @xmath68 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 , we consider that @xmath72 goes with the variable @xmath69 , @xmath73 with @xmath71 , so the @xmath74 are now implicit and we have @xmath75 with this notation , the left hand side of equation ( [ reduit2 ] ) is now @xmath76 more explicitly @xmath77 . in the following",
    "we shall calculate in detail all the terms of the right hand side of equation ( [ reduit2 ] ) .",
    "the first term of ( [ reduit2 ] ) is very simple . from equation ( [ wrho1 ] ) , we know that @xmath78 is the sum of a term of degree two and a term of degree four in the external sources .",
    "the first term in the right hand side of equation ( [ reduit2 ] ) contains only two functional derivatives .",
    "thus , at zero sources , the second term of @xmath78 does not contribute . by definition of functional derivatives ,",
    "the first term gives us @xmath79      the second term of equation ( [ reduit2 ] ) is @xmath80 where we wrote @xmath81 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath84 . according to equations ( [ coprodpd ] ) , each term @xmath65 contains at least one functional derivative .",
    "therefore , the first term of @xmath3 does not contribute because it is of degree 2 .",
    "the second term of @xmath3 is of degree four , and it contains two sources @xmath85 and two sources @xmath86 .",
    "the functional derivatives are evaluated at zero sources , thus @xmath65 must be the product of a derivative with respect to a source @xmath85 and a derivative with respect to a source @xmath86 . according to equation ( [ coprodpd ] ) , there are four terms with this property in @xmath87 : @xmath88    the second term of equation ( [ reduit2 ] ) becomes @xmath89 let us now consider the first term of ( [ secondterm ] ) . according to ( [ nbodyg ] ) , @xmath90 . according to ( [ delta4 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath91 for the second term of ( [ secondterm ] ) we have @xmath92 and @xmath93 interchanging the variables @xmath6 and @xmath55 , we see that the third term of ( [ secondterm ] ) is equal to the first one , and the fourth term is equal to the second one .",
    "finally , the second term of ( [ reduit2 ] ) becomes the sum of @xmath94 and @xmath95      the third term is @xmath96 for this term , two kinds of @xmath97 intervene : with one or three products in @xmath65 . for the first kind of terms ,",
    "the relevant coproducts are @xmath98 and the result is @xmath99 we have interchanged the variables @xmath6 and @xmath55 to obtain the last line .",
    "we use now @xmath100 and @xmath101 to get @xmath102 for the second kind of terms , the relevant coproducts are @xmath103 . again , interchanging @xmath6 and @xmath55 shows that these two terms give the same contribution and the result is @xmath104 we calculate @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the contribution of the second kind of terms becomes @xmath107      the fourth term of equation ( [ reduit2 ] ) is @xmath108 here we meet something new because we must use the reduced coproduct @xmath109 . according to the general formula ( [ deltadef])of i",
    ", this reduced coproduct is obtained by multiplying @xmath87 by itself .",
    "the spacetime variables of the first @xmath87 will still be denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath55 , while the spacetime variables of the second @xmath87 will be denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath110 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath111 variable of the second @xmath87 will be written @xmath112 .",
    "each term @xmath65 of @xmath87 is at least of degree 1 , so each term of @xmath113 is at least of degree 2 .",
    "therefore , the only term of @xmath3 that contributes to @xmath114 is @xmath17 .",
    "we use again the fact that @xmath17 is a product of two sources @xmath85 and two sources @xmath86 to deduce that @xmath113 must be the product of a functional derivative with respect to @xmath85 and a functional derivative with respect to @xmath86 .",
    "the eight terms @xmath113 that satisfy this condition are @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath115 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "this gives us eight terms which are all identical if we interchange 1 with 1 or 2 with 2 or ( 1,1 ) with ( 2,2 ) .",
    "thus , the fourth term of equation ( [ reduit2 ] ) becomes @xmath123 we have just to calculate @xmath124 and @xmath125 the final expression for the fourth term is then @xmath126      the fifth term of equation ( [ reduit2 ] ) is @xmath127 to give nonzero contributions , @xmath128 must contain three functional derivatives : one functional derivative with respect to a @xmath86 and two with respect to @xmath85 .",
    "this gives us three kinds of terms : ( i ) the argument of @xmath86 does not come from the same @xmath43 as the arguments of the two @xmath85 , as in @xmath129 ( ii ) the argument of @xmath86 is the same as that of one of the two @xmath85 , for example @xmath130 ( iii ) the argument of @xmath86 comes from the same @xmath43 as the argument of one of the two @xmath85 but they are not identical , for example @xmath131 . in @xmath109",
    "there are four terms of type ( i ) , eight terms of type ( ii ) and eight terms of type ( iii ) .",
    "all the terms of each class give the same contribution .",
    "we calculate now the contribution of the three kinds of terms      the sum of the terms of type ( i ) is @xmath132 we compute @xmath133 and @xmath134 to obtain @xmath135      the sum of the terms of type ( ii ) is @xmath136 we use @xmath137 and @xmath138 therefore , the fifth term of type ( ii ) becomes @xmath139      the sum of the terms of type ( iii ) is @xmath140 we have @xmath141 and @xmath142 the fifth term of type ( iii ) becomes @xmath143      the sixth term of equation ( [ reduit2 ] ) is @xmath144 it looks complicated because we have now @xmath145 .",
    "the third @xmath87 will have the variables @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "again , we need one derivative with respect to @xmath86 and two derivatives with respect to @xmath85 in @xmath149",
    ". there are 24 terms of this kind in @xmath150 , and they all give the same contribution as @xmath151 .",
    "thus , the sixth term is @xmath152 we compute @xmath153 and @xmath154 the last term of equation ( [ reduit2 ] ) is then @xmath155      if we gather all the previous results , we obtain the green function hierarchy @xmath156    in terms of the feynman diagrams of nonequilibrium quantum field theory @xcite , these terms can be rewritten as in figure 1 .",
    "the order of the terms is the same in equation ( [ hierarchie ] ) and in figure 1 .    ) . ]",
    "the hierarchy of green functions presented here is an important step in the effective calculation of degenerate systems .",
    "however , the practical implementation of this hierarchy requires an approximation to close it .",
    "the gw approximation @xcite is a well - known and powerful way of closing the hierarchy .",
    "it has to be adapted to our more complicated hierarchy . for the calculation of the optical properties of allochromatic crystals",
    ", it will also be necessary to adapt the bethe - salpeter approach @xcite to our setting",
    ".    moreover , a functional derivation of the energy with respect to the density matrix provides equations that enable us to unify the green - function formalism and the diagonalization method of many - body theory .",
    "this will be presented in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
