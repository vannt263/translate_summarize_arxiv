    "a system of interacting lattice bosons undergoes a phase transition between a superfluid and a mott insulator @xcite .",
    "motivated by the recent discovery of a mott - insulating state in an ultracold gas of rubidium atoms in an optical lattice @xcite , we study the effect of strong ( i.e. hard - core ) interaction in a gas of lattice bosons .",
    "the strength of the interaction is tuned effectively by introducing @xmath0 components in the bose gas [ 5 - 12 ] .",
    "these components can be considered as @xmath0 degenerate states per site of the optical lattice , assuming that there is a hard - core interaction only in the same state .",
    "thus , the bosons can avoid hard - core interaction by choosing an unoccupied state , leading to an effective interaction between the bosons that becomes weaker with an increasing number of states @xmath0 .",
    "another tunable parameter is the tunneling rate @xmath3 between neighboring sites of the optical lattice . for sufficiently small tunneling rate the bose - einstein condensate",
    "disappear , since for @xmath4 ( atomic limit ) there can be no condensate but only a ( mott ) insulator . in order to study the properties of such a multicomponent bose gas we evaluate physical quantities like the particle density , the condensate density , the structural order parameter with respect to the @xmath0 components and the density - density correlation function .",
    "our method is a saddle - point integration for large values of @xmath0 and a @xmath2 expansion @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for a bose gas in a @xmath5-dimensional optical lattice with @xmath6 sites and @xmath0 states per site is @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of a hard - core boson at site @xmath10 on the optical lattice and in state @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath12 . the states @xmath13 refer to @xmath0 different components of the bose gas .",
    "@xmath14 is the tunneling rate for a hard - core boson from the state @xmath15 at site @xmath16 to the state @xmath11 at site @xmath10 . here",
    "we will assume isotropic tunneling @xmath17 for the functional integral we introduce @xmath18 with @xmath19 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this system can be characterized by a diagonal order parameter for the components @xmath11 : @xmath20 which is the number operator of component @xmath11 .",
    "an off - diagonal order parameter is @xmath21 which measures how likely it is to switch a particle from component @xmath15 to component @xmath11 . besides the expectation value of these order parameters",
    "we also need their correlations to describe ordering of these degrees of freedom .",
    "the starting point is the grand - canonical ensemble of the @xmath0-state hard - core bose gas .",
    "it is defined by the partition function @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 controls the particle number in the grand - canonical ensemble @xcite.in the following , we will use the fugacity @xmath25 instead of the chemical potential @xmath26 .",
    "it was shown @xcite that @xmath22 can be expressed by a functional integral with respect to two complex fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 are coordinates of a space - time lattice , where the time is @xmath30 .",
    "the field is periodic with respect to time : @xmath31 .",
    "the partition function then reads @xmath32 with the action @xmath33",
    "@xmath34   \\label{sp2}\\ ] ] and the prefactor @xmath35 the number of states @xmath0 only appears in front of the @xmath0-independent action in the partition function . therefore the functional integration can be performed for large values of @xmath0 by a saddle - point ( sp ) approximation @xcite .",
    "the corresponding sp equations can be solved with uniform solutions : @xmath36 with @xmath37 two uniform sps are found , a trivial sp @xmath38 labeled by @xmath39 and a non - trivial sp @xmath40 @xmath41 with broken @xmath42 symmetry , labeled by @xmath43 .",
    "the complex fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 are expected to fluctuate about the sp solution @xmath44 in order to study the effect of the fluctuations , we introduce a four component real field @xmath45 substituting this result into the partition function leads to a gaussian approximation @xmath46 where the first factor is the partition function for @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49   \\label{sp16}\\ ] ] and the second factor describes the partition function of quasiparticles , which arise from @xmath2-corrections @xmath50 ,   \\label{sp17}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 denotes a scalar product .    the prefactor @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ sp16 ] ) comes from the summation over all lattice sites @xmath53 .",
    "the fourier components of the quasiparticle green s functions are @xmath54-matrices of the form @xmath55 with the @xmath56-matrices    @xmath57    @xmath58 and @xmath59 now we can perform the gaussian integral over the fluctuating field ( [ sp17 ] ) and get @xmath60      in the superfluid phase , the matrix @xmath61 can be recognized as green s function of quasiparticles , the elementary excitations out of the condensate .",
    "the quasiparticle poles of the eigenvalues of @xmath62 lead to the excitation spectrum . identifying @xmath63 with the excitation energies @xmath64 ,",
    "one gets for small wave vectors @xmath65 : @xmath66 in the region @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is valid for the chemical potential , one can identify @xmath69 and gets the bogoliubov spectrum for the weakly interacting bose gas @xmath70 the linear dispersion relation for small wave vectors @xmath65 is due to a goldstone mode .",
    "correlation functions can be defined by introducing the generating fields @xmath71 and @xmath72 and a generating functional @xmath73 where @xmath74 @xmath75 \\ ; .\\ ] ] @xmath71 generates the field of the bosons and @xmath72 the field of empty sites . according to eqs .",
    "( [ sp1 ] ) and ( [ sp2 ] ) the partition function is given as @xmath76 an @xmath77-particle correlation function can be defined as @xmath78    all physical quantities that we present in the following are defined in terms of these expectation values .",
    "the only exception is the total density of particles , that can be defined as @xmath79 all physical results are evaluated for zero temperature .",
    "the total particle density per site and component ( [ ntotcorr ] ) gives in the large-@xmath0 limit @xmath80 the @xmath2-correction of @xmath77 in the empty phase @xmath81 vanishes but in the superfluid phase the total density is enhanced . for large values of @xmath82",
    "the density approaches the value 1 ( the `` full '' lattice ) , indicating the tendency to a mott insulating state .",
    "our definition of the condensate density is based on off - diagonal long - range order , using the single particle correlation function @xcite : @xmath83 for this quantity , the large-@xmath0 limit is @xmath84 and indicates a depletion for large values of @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath2-corrections even show a destruction of the condensate density for sufficiently large @xmath82 , which can be regarded as another hint at the formation of a mott insulator , where the phase coherence and therefore the condensate is expected to be destroyed ( see figures 1 and 2 ) .    because of",
    "the goldstone mode in the excitation spectrum of quasiparticles , the @xmath2-corrections diverge for the dimensions @xmath85 and @xmath86 , in agreement with the expectation that in these cases there should not be a condensate .",
    "the appropriate quantity describing the correlation of the internal structure of the components of a given site is given by the expectation value of ( [ structop ] ) as @xmath87 for @xmath88 this is equal to @xmath89 , @xmath77 being the total density of particles .",
    "for @xmath90 the @xmath1-limit is equal to that of the condensate density , but the @xmath2-correction is slightly higher . as for the condensate density ,",
    "the corrections indicate a destruction of the condensate for large values of @xmath82 .",
    "therefore this correlation function seems to be suppressed in a mott insulating phase , too ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the relation ( [ ntotcorr ] ) suggests the definition of a density - density correlation function as @xmath91 in the large-@xmath0 limit this correlation function reduces to the square of the particle density : @xmath92 the correlation length of spacially decaying @xmath2-corrections diverges at the critical fugacity @xmath93 : @xmath94",
    "we have found a depletion of the condensate caused by strong interaction in a dense @xmath0-component bose gas .",
    "this effect leads eventually to the destruction of the condensate and to the formation of a mott insulator for sufficiently large fugacity @xmath82 at @xmath95 .",
    "however , the condensate survives in the limit @xmath96 , since the interaction is always weak in this case . on the other hand , in the very dilute regime ( i.e. for @xmath97 ) the condensate density increases with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "this reflects the well - known fact that an increasing interaction supports be condensation in a dilute bose gas @xcite .",
    "the structural order parameter @xmath98 measures the correlation between the @xmath0 different states of the bose gas .",
    "this quantity behaves qualitatively like the condensate density but differently on a quantitative level : the dilute regime , where the interaction supports this parameter , is broader and its destruction happens at higher values of @xmath82 .",
    "our saddle - point approximation is similar to the bogoliubov theory at low densities @xcite but deviates substantially from the latter at higher densities . in particular , the appearence of a gap in the excitation spectrum of the mott - insulating phase is beyond the bogoliubov theory .    0.5 cm acknowledgement :",
