    "the atmospheric neutrino anomaly observed by super - kamiokande(sk ) and other recent underground experiments strongly suggests @xmath3 neutrino oscillation .",
    "the allowed region of the oscillation parameters obtained by sk are in the range of @xmath4 ev@xmath5 and @xmath6 0.88 with 90% confidence level@xcite , where @xmath7 is the mass difference squared between two neutrino mass eigenstates and @xmath8 is the mixing angle between two neutrinos .",
    "the principal goal of the k2k experiment is to confirm neutrino oscillation with a man - made neutrino beam and to measure the oscillation parameters .",
    "[ fig1 ] is a schematic of the setup .",
    "we use the 12 gev kek - ps as a neutrino source and sk as the far detector .",
    "the distance between kek and sk is 250@xmath9 , and the neutrino beam has an average energy of 1.4 gev .",
    "the neutrinos are produced by charged pion decays and expected to be 99% pure @xmath10 with an angular deviation @xmath11 3 @xmath12 . in order to measure the effects of oscillation we compare the @xmath10 spectrum observed by sk to the one measured in the front detectors at the point of production .",
    "[ fig2](a ) shows the monte carlo simulation of reconstructed neutrino spectra at sk for @xmath13 protons on target(@xmath14 ) .",
    "this corresponds to approximately 5 years of measurement .",
    "oscillated spectra for four specific oscillation parameter sets are shown .",
    "the effects of oscillation are seen in the figures as a significant divergence from the spectra of the null oscillation case , which is given by open histograms .",
    "k2k s 90% confidence level sensitivity covers almost all of the 90% allowed regions obtained by kamiokande and sk , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the record of protons on target . after the completion of the front detector construction in feb .",
    "1999 , the fast extraction of protons for the experiment started on feb .",
    "3 . on mar .",
    "4 , the neutrino beam daq started with a horn current of 175 ka and with proton intensity of 3@xmath010@xmath15 .",
    "after engineering runs to study neutrino beam operations in april through may , stable data taking began in june with an aluminum target with 2@xmath16 , a horn current of 200 ka , and a proton intensity of 4.5@xmath17 . after the summer shutdown , continuous data taking began again in november , this time with an aluminum target of @xmath18 and a horn current of 250 ka with 5@xmath17 . in 1999",
    "we accumulated 7.2 @xmath19 in total .",
    "the near detector system consists of a 1kt water cherenkov detector(1kt ) and a fine - grained detector(fgd ) .",
    "the latter consists of a scintillating fiber tracker(sft)@xcite , plastic scintillator veto counters , an electromagnetic calorimeter of 600 lead glass blocks , and a muon ranger of 12 iron plates ( 10@xmath204 + 20@xmath208 ) with drift chambers(muc ) .",
    "the sft is composed of 19 layers of 6@xmath21-thick water containers sandwiched with 20@xmath0(@xmath22-@xmath23 ) layers of 700@xmath24 scintillating fibers .",
    "muc contained events are used to check the stability of the neutrino beam .",
    "this is because the large fiducial volume mass of the muc results in a very large event rate .",
    "the beam center is observed to be stable to within 1@xmath25 .",
    "in addition , spill by spill beam centering , monitored by the profile of the muons produced by pion - decay that penetrate the beam dump , was also found to be within 0.5@xmath12 .",
    "[ fig4](a ) is an example of quasi - elastic(qe ) neutrino event candidates with vertex in the sft .",
    "the primary goal of the fgd is to reconstruct the neutrino spectrum by using qe samples .",
    "( b ) shows the reconstructed muon energy distribution for single track events , and ( c ) is @xmath26 distribution for 2 track samples , where @xmath27 is angular difference between reconstructed proton track and that calculated from muon momentum .",
    "the single track samples and 2 track samples with @xmath28 contain a large fraction of qe events , @xmath2960% and @xmath2980% respectively .",
    "we also study the ratio of inelastic events to qe events , in order to reduce the uncertainty of the calculated neutrino interaction cross section to less than 10% .",
    "this information is important not only for k2k , but also for the sk atmospheric neutrino analyses .",
    "table  [ table1 ] gives summary of the front detector results .",
    "event numbers normalized by mc predictions agree very well to each other ."
