    "there has been a great deal of activity in theoretical physics over the past few years involving the properties of various spacetimes in four and higher dimensions . apart from their obvious astrophysical significance",
    ", there have been applications to string theory , gauge theory ( via the ads / cft correspondence ) , and a growing interest in analogue models .",
    "most investigations have centred on particular spacetimes , typically a solution of einstein s equations arising in supergravity theory . however , it is important to distinguish particular properties from general ones . in other words ,",
    "we wish to see to what extent certain results obtained are due to the special properties of the metric used and to what extent they are universal , and valid for all metrics in a general class .",
    "in the case of _ static metrics _ a convenient tool for investigating such questions is the well known",
    "_ optical metric _ ( see @xcite for an elementary account ) which allows one to bring to bear on questions concerning non - rotating killing horizons , light bending etc . , the powerful tools of riemannian and projective geometry .",
    "for example , the optical distance diverges as one approaches a static killing horizon , and in this limit the metric is asymptotic to the metric on hyperbolic space with the radius of curvature being given by the inverse of the surface gravity of the horizon .",
    "one may use this fact to gain insight into `` no hair theorems '' and the loss of information arising as matter falls into the associated black hole @xcite .",
    "one may use the gauss - bonnet theorem and information about the curvature of the optical metric to make general statements about light bending @xcite and one may use the projective geometry to illuminate the dependence of light bending on the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "this leads naturally to the question of what replaces the optical metric when one is dealing with _ stationary metrics _ and can the associated geometric structures prove useful in dealing with rotating killing horizons , ergo - regions and ergo - spheres , the existence or otherwise of closed timelike curves .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show how , in order to answer this question , one needs to pass from riemannian to _ finsler _ geometry , to obtain two spatial geometric objects , a randers and a zermelo structure , related by legendre duality . taken with the original stationary spacetime ,",
    "one obtains a triple of structures linked by a kind of triality ( see figure [ network ] ) .",
    "this allows one to translate a problem in one language to one of the other two languages , often leading in this way to a dramatic simplification .",
    "for example much effort has been expended on understanding constant flag curvature for randers - finsler metrics @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , from the spacetime perspective the spacetime metrics are rather simple : all constant flag curvature randers - finsler metrics map to conformally flat spacetimes .",
    "in particular , the principal example in @xcite lifts to flat minkowski spacetime in rotating coordinates , whereas the example in @xcite maps to an einstein static universe in rotating coordinates .    the link between the three ideas",
    "is provided by a 1-form arising , in the spacetime picture , from the cross term @xmath0 in the metric @xmath1 of the spacetime manifold @xmath2 and associated with the _ dragging of inertial frames_. when viewed on the space of orbits @xmath3 of the time translation killing field @xmath4 , this gives rise to a one - form @xmath5 which , with a metric @xmath6 , endows @xmath7 with a randers structure , a type of finsler geometry which may be thought of physically in terms of a fully non - linear and exact version of _ gravito - magnetism_. light rays in @xmath8 project down on @xmath9 to finsler geodesics which in turn may be lifted to the cotangent bundle @xmath10 to give a _",
    "magnetic flow_. such flows have been extensively studied by mathematicians of late and , as we shall show , some of their results have applications in the present setting .",
    "moreover , we show that , in this magnetic picture , for all constant flag curvature randers - finsler 3-metrics , the magnetic field @xmath11 is a killing vector field of the riemannian part of the geometry @xmath6 .",
    "the alternative zermelo viewpoint works in terms of a vector field or _ wind _ @xmath12 , on @xmath13 , and a different metric @xmath14 .",
    "light rays then project down on @xmath15 to solutions of the zermelo problem : find the least time trajectory for a ship moving with constant speed in a wind @xmath12 .",
    "physically , this is where one makes contact with fluid dynamical analogue models in which a fluid vortex , sometime thought of in terms of an aether , gives rise to a maelstrom - like picture of a rotating black hole .",
    "currently , this idea , which can also work for a non - rotating black hole , is often associated with the use of painlev - gullstrand coordinates . and",
    "here we show that , indeed , the zermelo structure manifests itself in the spacetime picture by expressing the spacetime metric in a painlev - gullstrand form .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the network of relations : the triality between the zermelo problem , randers - finsler geometries and the null geodesic flow in conformally stationary spacetimes .",
    "we also discuss the magnetic flow viewpoint , the relation to analogue models and the gauge equivalence from the spacetime picture .",
    "in particular , the condition of spacetime conformal flatness is explored in both the randers and the zermelo pictures , and the relation to killing magnetic fields and constant flag curvature is established . in section 3",
    "we provide a variety of examples of increasing complexity .",
    "we start with langevin s rotating platform in minkowski spacetime , which maps to a randers - finsler geometry of constant flag curvature , physically interpreted as a varying magnetic field in a negatively curved space , and a zermelo problem of a constant angular velocity tornado ( or shen s rotating fish tank @xcite ) in flat space .",
    "let us note that , since the mapping between the spacetime and randers picture can be seen as a temporal kaluza - klein reduction , this example is akin ( in fact an analytic continuation ) to the melvin solution in kaluza - klein theory @xcite .",
    "section [ magneticfields ] explores , in contrast to the first one , several examples where the randers picture is physically simpler than the zermelo one , and in some cases , even simpler than the spacetime picture : constant or varying magnetic fields in @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "the particular example of section [ godelsection ] allows us to relate the finsler condition with isoperimetric inequalities , novikov s action functional and ergodic theory .",
    "section [ esu ] gives another example of a randers - finsler geometry of constant flag curvature which is simply interpreted in the spacetime picture : a conformally flat spacetime ",
    "the einstein static universe ( esu )  in rotating coordinates .",
    "we then consider a genuinely rotating esu , the anti - mach geometry , and its randers and zermelo pictures are exhibited . in section [ kerrsection ] , we discuss the randers and zermelo pictures for the kerr geometry . while these pictures are valid asymptotically , they break down at the ergo - sphere . to cover the ergo - region , we actually need to introduce co - rotating coordinates , and then the randers / zermelo pictures break down asymptotically .",
    "using these co - rotating coordinates , we show that the riemannian part of the randers metric is hyperbolic near the horizon for non - extremal kerr , in similarity with the general non - rotating killing horizon .",
    "the randers / zermelo pictures of the near horizon extremal case , the nhek geometry , are also considered and , in particular , the zermelo picture turns out to be quite simple : an azimuthal wind in a deformed 3-sphere .",
    "we finish in section [ final ] with some final remarks .",
    "the zermelo navigation problem @xcite is a time - optimal control problem , which aims at finding the minimum time trajectories in a riemannian manifold @xmath18 ( @xmath19 with the euclidean metric in @xcite ) under the influence of a drift ( wind ) represented by a vector field @xmath12 . assuming a time independent wind",
    ", shen @xcite has shown that the trajectories which minimize travel time are exactly the geodesics of a particular finsler geometry , known as _",
    "randers metric _ @xcite , whose norm is given by f(x,)=+b_i(x)v^i  ,   * v*t_x  .",
    "[ randersle]for the geodesics of ( [ randersle ] ) to solve the corresponding zermelo problem , the randers data @xmath20 are determined in terms of the zermelo data @xmath21 as @xcite : a_ij & = & h_ij + w_i w_j ^2  , = 1- h_ij w^i w^j  , [ randers1 ] + b_i & = & -w_i  , w_i = h_ij w^j  .",
    "[ randers2 ] note also that a^ij = ( h^ij - w^i w^j )  .",
    "it has also been shown @xcite that _ every _ randers metric @xmath22 arises as the solution to a zermelo s problem of navigation , defined by the data @xmath21 .",
    "the latter is defined by the former as : h_ij & = & ( a_ij -b_i b_j )  , = 1- a^ij b_i b_j  , [ zermelo1 ] + w^i & = & -b^i  , b^i = a^ij b_j  .",
    "[ zermelo2 ] note also that h^ij = a^ij + b^i b^j ^2  .",
    "thus , there is a natural identification of randers metrics with solutions to the zermelo problem .",
    "it should be observed that @xmath23 the _ finsler condition _",
    "@xmath24 ensures that @xmath22 is positive and the metric is convex , i.e. @xmath25 is positive definite for all non - zero @xmath26 @xcite .      for a generic finsler norm ,",
    "the geodesics of @xmath22 are obtained by taking @xmath22 as the finsler lagrangian . however , for a hamiltonian treatment , we need to consider a lagrangian which is not homogeneous of degree one in velocities , since the associated hamiltonian would vanish .",
    "it is convenient to consider a lagrangian of degree two in velocities .",
    "thus , since @xmath27 is a finsler lagrangian which is homogeneous of degree one , we define a lagrangian by l= f^2  .",
    "hence , the hamiltonian will also be of degree two in the momenta p_i = l v^i= f f v^i  .",
    "in fact , h(x , p)= l(x , )  .",
    "it is convenient to define a function @xmath28 which is homogeneous of degree one in momenta by h= g^2",
    ". thus g(x , p ) = f(x , )  .",
    "specializing @xmath22 to be given by the randers metric ( [ randersle ] ) , we have p_i = f ( n_i + b_i )  , n_i= a_ijv^j  ; since @xmath29 , we find that g= - w^ip_i  , where @xmath30 are the associated zermelo data",
    ". thus , the legendre transformation maps the randers ( lagrangian ) data to the zermelo ( hamiltonian ) one .",
    "note that one may think of @xmath31 as the sum of two moment maps g = g_0 + g_1  , where g_0=  , generates the geodesic flow and g_1=-w^i p_i  , generates the lift to the cotangent bundle of the one parameter group of diffeomorphisms of the base manifold generated by the vector field @xmath32 .",
    "observe that these two flows commute \\{g_0,g_1}=0  , if and only if @xmath12 is a killing vector field . in the case",
    "that the base manifold is a sphere and @xmath12 a killing vector field , these are the flows constructed by katok @xcite and discussed by ziller @xcite .",
    "they correspond to rigid rotation on the sphere .",
    "the geodesic flow of the randers metric can be seen as the null geodesic flow in a stationary spacetime with generic form g _ dx^dx ^= -v^2 ( dt + _ i dx^i ) ^2 + _ ij dx ^i dx ^j  , [ stationarymetric ] so that g_ij= _ ij -v^2 _ i _ j  .",

    "ij  , [ staranders1 ] + a^ij & = & v^2 ^ij  , + b_i & = & -_i  [ staranders2 ] .",
    "thus we call the form ds^2=v^2  , [ randersform ] the _ randers form _ of a stationary metric . note that for @xmath33 , @xmath6 is the usual _ optical metric _ ( see @xcite for an elementary introduction ) .    using ( [ zermelo1 ] ) , ( [ zermelo2 ] ) , the randers data are equivalent to a zermelo structure of the form h_ij&= & 1 1 + v^2 g^rs _ r _ s g_ij v^2  , [ stazermelo1 ] + w^i&= & v^2 g^ij_j  , [ stazermelo2 ] where _ ij&= & g_ij + v^2 _ i _ j  , + ^ij & = & g^ij - v^2 ^i ^j 1 + v^2 g^rs _ r _ s  , and ^i = g^ij _ j  , w^i = v^2 ^ij _ j 1-v^2 ^rs _ r _ s  , 1- v^2 ^ij _ i _ j= 1 1 + v^2 g^ij _ i _ j  .",
    "there is actually a more familiar way to extract the zermelo data from a stationary spacetime . inverting ( [ staranders1 ] ) , ( [ staranders2 ] ) and using ( [ randers1 ] ) , ( [ randers2 ] )",
    "one finds the spacetime metric ( [ stationarymetric ] ) in the form ds^2=[zermeloform ]  .",
    "this is the _ zermelo form _ of a stationary spacetime .",
    "one recognizes the metric in square brackets as having a painlev - gullstrand form @xcite . since in the spacetime picture of the zermelo problem",
    "/ randers flow one is interested only in the null geodesic flow , the spacetime metric is only defined up to a conformal factor .",
    "thus , the zermelo data encoded in a stationary spacetime can be read off simply by writing it ( conformally ) in a painlev - gullstrand form .",
    "it should be noted , however , that for a given spacetime , an apparently different zermelo structure can be obtained by writing the spacetime metric in painlev - gullstrand _ coordinates_. it is helpful to give an example . in these",
    "coordinates @xmath34 , the schwarzschild metric is ds ^2 = -d^2 + ( dr+vd)^2 + r^2 ( d ^2 + ^2 d ^2 )  , v  .",
    "one finds immediately that the zermelo structure is = -v r  , h_ijdx^i dx^j= dr^2 + r^2 ( d ^2 + ^2 d ^2 )  , [ zersch1]which is interpreted as a radial wind in flat space . on the other hand ,",
    "the zermelo structure derived by writing the schwarzschild solution in the usual schwarzschild coordinates @xmath35 , in the form ( [ zermeloform ] ) , has no wind and the spatial metric is the usual optical metric , = 0  , h_ij dx^i dx^j = dr ^2 ( 1-v^2)^2 + r^2 1-v^2 ( d ^2 + ^2 d^2 )  .",
    "[ zersch2 ] the two zermelo structures ( [ zersch1 ] ) and ( [ zersch2 ] ) are equivalent in the sense that the trajectories of one can be mapped to the trajectories of the other one .",
    "this equivalence is obvious in the spacetime picture , since both structures correspond to the same spacetime in different coordinates ; but it is not obvious in the zermelo picture itself . in the randers picture ,",
    "on the other hand , the equivalence is again obvious , since @xmath6 is , in both cases , the optical metric and @xmath5 differs only by a gauge transformation .",
    "this type of equivalence is one example of the large class of gauge equivalences which will be present in our discussion of the spacetime / randers / zermelo triangle and which we will explore more in section [ sectiongauge ] . in section [ kerrsection ]",
    ", we will briefly compare the analogue of these two zermelo structures in the kerr case .",
    "given the simple physical interpretation of the zermelo problem , it should not come as a surprise at this point that many analogue models of black holes are naturally written in the painlev - gullstrand form ( see , for instance @xcite ) , as we shall now discuss briefly .",
    "metrics of painlev - gullstrand form are frequently encountered in discussions of waves propagating in moving media and go back at least to a paper of gordon @xcite on electromagnetic waves in a moving dielectric medium .",
    "similar metrics have arisen when discussing sound waves in a moving compressible medium such as the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "more recently attempts have been made to construct analogue models of black holes @xcite and again similar metrics are used .",
    "typically such metrics are taken to be accurate just to quadratic order in velocities and the underlying spatial metric to be flat .",
    "thus one considers a metric of the form ds ^2= -c^2(*x * ) dt^2 + ( d*x * -*w * ( * x*,t ) dt ) ^2 , [ analogue ] where @xmath36 is the local light or sound speed and @xmath37 the velocity of the medium .",
    "both @xmath38 and @xmath39 could , as indicated , be time dependent but from now on we shall assume that both are independent of time . if @xmath38 and @xmath40 were constant , then ( [ analogue ] ) would be obtained by performing a galileo transformation on the flat metric ds^2= -c^2 dt^ ^2 + ( d * x * ^)^2  ,   t^= t  , ^= * x * - * w * t  . the scalar wave equation for a scalar field @xmath41 , = 0  , becomes = 0  , [ morseingard ] which is indeed the wave equation of ( [ analogue ] ) .",
    "one could adopt ( [ morseingard ] ) or some variant of ( [ morseingard ] ) with lower order terms even if @xmath38 and @xmath12 depend on space and time .",
    "one would still find that the characteristics , i.e. the rays   would be null geodesics of the metric ( [ analogue ] ) .",
    "an interesting example is provided by a cylindrically symmetric vortex flow @xcite for which , in suitable units , @xmath42 and = _ where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 is a unit vector in the @xmath46 direction . the metric ( [ analogue ] ) becomes ds^2 = -dt ^2 + d^2 + ^2 ( d + ^2 dt ) ^2 + d z^2 . the metric is well defined and has lorentzian signature for all @xmath47 .",
    "the surfaces @xmath48 are timelike for all @xmath49 .",
    "thus , there is no killing horizon , and hence no analogue black hole , in this metric ( in agreement with @xcite ) .",
    "the surface @xmath50 is a timelike ergo - sphere inside which the killing vector @xmath51 becomes spacelike .",
    "this closely resembles the cylindrical analogues discussed by zeldovich when he suggested the possibility of superradience for the kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "the randers orbits are generated by the finsler norm ( [ randersle ] ) taken as a lagrangian : @xmath52 .",
    "an immediate observation , already pointed out in @xcite is that these can be interpreted as motion in a magnetic field .",
    "indeed , the euler - lagrange equations for the finsler norm are @xmath53 where @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is arc length with respect to the riemannian metric @xmath6 . in terms of the standard magnetic potential @xmath56 the orbits of a charged particle ( mass @xmath57 , charge @xmath58 ) can be written , using the same parametrization , as @xmath59 where the energy @xmath60 is @xmath61 and @xmath62 is proper time .",
    "thus , the randers 1-form @xmath63 relates to the physical magnetic potential 1-form by b = a  .",
    "[ randerstophysical]note , in particular , the dependence on the energy .",
    "we shall come back to this point in the example of section [ godelsection ] .    from a physicists perspective , this is actually the most natural way to look at randers metrics : as describing motion on curved manifolds with a magnetic field = b^i  , b^i = a^ij(^(3 ) db)_j  , [ magfield]denoting hodge duality with respect to @xmath6 by @xmath64 . from the perspective of section ( [ stationary ] ) , the spacetime geodesics , when projected down to the base manifold @xmath65 , with metric @xmath6 , are no longer geodesics ; rather they satisfy the equations of motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field , which is described by the maxwell 2-form @xmath66 .",
    "the particle paths may be lifted to the cotangent bundle of @xmath67 where they are referred to as _ magnetic flows_.",
    "they may be regarded as a hamiltonian system where the hamiltonian coincides with the usual energy h=",
    "g^ijp_i p_j  , but where the symplectic form @xmath68 is modified = d p_i d q^i + f  .",
    "this magnetic flow then uplifts to one dimension more ( in a temporal version of the kaluza - klein picture ) as the null geodesic flow discussed in section ( [ stationary ] ) .",
    "magnetic flows have been quite extensively studied in the mathematics literature . in particular ,",
    "some of the phenomena to be discussed here , involving the breakdown of the randers structure and , at times , the transition between the behaviour with and without closed timelike curves in the spacetime picture , has been noticed , albeit without that interpretation @xcite . to discuss them here",
    "it is useful to choose a particular `` conformal gauge '' .      with regard to the randers / zermelo structure",
    ", conformally related spacetimes form an equivalence class . thus , for this purpose , we can always take the representative in this equivalence class to be _ ultra - stationary _ , that is a spacetime @xmath69 admitting an everywhere timelike killing vector field @xmath70 with unit length , @xmath71 .",
    "such spacetimes may be considered , as a bundle over a base manifold @xmath65 consisting of the space of orbits of the killing vector field .",
    "these orbits , sometimes called timelines , may either be circles , @xmath72 , in which case time is periodic , or lines @xmath73 . in the former case",
    "there are obviously closed timelike curves ( ctc s ) .",
    "if the bundle is a trivial product , @xmath74 , these ctc s may be eliminated by passing to a covering space .",
    "then the question is : do there exist ctc s which are homotopically trivial , i.e. which may be shrunk to a point ? if the bundle is non - trivial , things may be more complicated .",
    "spacetime may already be simply connected . in that case",
    "the ctc s may not be eliminated by passing to a covering spacetime .",

    "<S> we consider a triality between the zermelo navigation problem , the geodesic flow on a finslerian geometry of randers type , and spacetimes in one dimension higher admitting a timelike conformal killing vector field . from the latter viewpoint , </S>",
    "<S> the data of the zermelo problem are encoded in a ( conformally ) painlev - gullstrand form of the spacetime metric , whereas the data of the randers problem are encoded in a stationary generalisation of the usual optical metric . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how the spacetime viewpoint gives a simple and physical perspective on various issues , including how finsler geometries with constant flag curvature always map to conformally flat spacetimes and that the finsler condition maps to either a causality condition or it breaks down at an ergo - surface in the spacetime picture . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge equivalence in this network of relations is considered as well as the connection to analogue models and the viewpoint of magnetic flows . </S>",
