    "the cytoskeleton is a complex meshwork made of long elastic filaments coupled together with the help of numerous , rather compact crosslinking proteins  @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of cytoskeletal assemblies is their dynamic nature , which allows them to react to external stimuli and adapt their internal structure and mechanical properties according to the needs of the cell .",
    "the reversible nature of crosslink binding is an important mechanism that underlies these dynamical processes .",
    "for example , living cells show complex rheological properties that range from fluidization to reinforcement under stress@xcite , and reversible bonds between cytoskeletal filaments have been proposed as key mechanisms in mediating between these contradicting behaviors @xcite .",
    "similar effects are believed to be important for the rheological properties of reconstituted f - actin networks@xcite , in particular at low frequencies that correspond to the lifetime of the crosslink - mediated bond@xcite .",
    "another important class of cytoskeletal assemblies are filament bundles . crosslinked f - actin bundles form primary structural components of a broad range of cytoskeletal structures including stereocilia , filopodia , microvilli or the sperm acrosome .",
    "type and properties of the crosslinking protein allow the cell to tailor the dimensions and mechanical properties of the bundles to suit specific biological functions .",
    "in particular , the mechanical properties of these bundles play key roles in cellular functions ranging from locomotion@xcite to mechanotransduction@xcite , and fertilization@xcite .    in - vitro experiments and modeling have emphasized the role of the crosslink stiffness in mediating bundle mechanical properties@xcite .",
    "it is less clear , however , in how far the reversibility of the crosslinking bond may affect bundle mechanical or dynamical properties . on the one hand ,",
    "one expects reversible bonds to influence the conformational properties of the filaments .",
    "examples for this dependency are the formation of kinks in the bundle contour@xcite , or an unbundling transition as the binding affinity of the crosslinks is reduced@xcite .",
    "conversely , bundle conformational changes or the application of destabilizing forces@xcite directly influence the binding state of the crosslinks .",
    "the aim of this article is to deepen our understanding of this complex interplay between reversible crosslink binding and bundle mechanical and dynamical properties .",
    "we consider the nonlinear response of a reversibly crosslinked filament bundle to an imposed external force or deformation .",
    "in particular , we want to determine how the external driving is reflected in the internal degrees of freedom of the bundle , notably the binding state of the crosslinks .",
    "combining simulations and theory we will show that , depending on the mechanical stiffness of the crosslinking agent , the fraction of bound crosslinks can display a sudden and discontinuous drop .",
    "this indicates a _ cooperative unbinding process _ that involves the crossing of a free energy barrier . choosing the proper crosslinking protein , therefore , not only allows one to change the composite elastic properties of the bundle , but also the relevant time - scales : the latter can be tuned from the single crosslink binding rate to the ( much longer ) escape time over the free energy barrier ( a short communication of these results was recently presented by one of us in ref .  ) .",
    "we emphasize that related effects may be important in a variety of different biological contexts also .",
    "for example , cellular adhesion and locomotion are dependent on the formation of transient cell - to - matrix bonds@xcite .",
    "simple theoretical models highlight the complex interplay between specific adhesion , mediated by the binding agent , unspecific interaction with the substrate , and cell - membrane elasticity@xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : model ] , we define and motivate our bundle model .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : sim ] , we present our numerical results obtained in monte carlo simulations . in section  [ sec : the ] , the development of a theoretical model is described .",
    "the combined efforts of simulation and theory allow us to obtain a detailed understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms that affect the crosslink binding state .",
    "we end in section  [ sec : final ] with a discussion of the implications and the experimental relevance of our results .",

    "( b ) `` close - up '' view of the bundle inner structure . in our model ,",
    "the bundle consists of @xmath3 filaments , each filament being a chain of @xmath4 beads connected by harmonic springs ( horizontal bonds ) .",
    "the beads can slide along the bundle contour , as indicated by the displacement @xmath5 .",
    "the filaments are joined to each other by crosslinks ( vertical bonds ) which may dynamically bind and unbind . ]",
    "we consider a bundle in a two - dimensional plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration1](a ) ) .",
    "the bundle has length @xmath0 and , in the initial state , is oriented along the @xmath6-axis of a fixed laboratory frame ( configuration  1 ) .",
    "we now envision an experiment whereby the bundle is brought from the initial state to a `` bent '' state ( configuration  2 ) . in the bent state , the contour ( shape ) of the bundle is described by a transverse displacement @xmath1 , the functional form of which depends on the boundary conditions and the specific way of loading ( e.g.  bending or buckling ) .",
    "while the details of the loading are irrelevant for the subsequent analysis we choose @xmath7 which mimics an experiment where an end - grafted bundle is deformed by a tip - load at its free end @xcite .",
    "note that the choice of eq .",
    "( [ eq : shape ] ) is not essential : qualitatively similar results are obtained with different bundle shapes also .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 reflects the bundle curvature and will serve as a measure of the amplitude of the imposed bending deformation .    in principle",
    ", crosslink reorganization may affect the local curvature and lead to the formation of kinks in the bundle contour  @xcite . in the following we are primarily interested in the effect of an imposed deformation on the crosslink binding state , thus",
    ", bundle shape is assumed to be given and constant over the time - scale of interest . to bring the bundle from configuration @xmath8",
    "obviously requires a bending energy , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the filament bending stiffness .",
    "however , as @xmath1 is not allowed to change @xmath11 plays no role in what follows .",
    "the inner structure of the bundle is an array of @xmath12 parallel filaments that are spaced a distance @xmath13 apart ( fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration1](b ) ) .",
    "each filament is a chain of @xmath14 beads , with harmonic springs ( horizontal lines ) joining nearest neighboring beads ; the spring constant equals @xmath15 , and @xmath16 denotes the equilibrium spring length .",
    "beads can only slide along the contour , making their motions effectively one - dimensional .",
    "it therefore suffices to assign a single number @xmath5 to each bead , denoting the relative displacement of that bead from its equilibrium position .",
    "the possibility of performing lateral motion transverse to the bundle axis is thereby neglected . at sufficiently low crosslink density",
    "the entropy stored in these bending degrees of freedom have been shown to drive an unbundling transition@xcite . here",
    ", we are primarily interested in highly crosslinked bundles away from the unbundling transition , such that the lateral degrees of freedom can be assumed to be frozen out .    the filaments are joined to each other by crosslinks ( vertical bonds in fig.[fig : illustration1](b ) ) .",
    "a pair of beads can be crosslinked provided they are vertical nearest neighbors , i.e.  a bead @xmath17 can only be crosslinked to the two beads @xmath18 and not to any other beads .",
    "the maximum number of crosslinks thus equals @xmath19 but we emphasize that not all `` allowed '' vertical bonds are necessarily crosslinked , and so the actual number of crosslinks @xmath20 will generally be lower .",
    "the two dominant contributions to the elastic energy of the bundle are an axial strain and a shear strain .",
    "the former is due to stretching of filaments and may be written as @xmath21 with @xmath5 the relative bead displacements , and @xmath15 the spring constant of the horizontal bonds defined previously .",
    "note that @xmath15 is related to real material properties via @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the filament young modulus , @xmath24 its cross - sectional area , and @xmath16 the spacing between successive sites along the filament backbone .",
    "the resistance to shear deformations is mediated by the crosslinks : with their two heads crosslinks connect two neighboring filaments and provide a means of mechanical coupling between them . while the form of the shear strain follows naturally from the basic definitions of continuum elasticity , it is nevertheless illustrative to discuss its physical basis . as a consequence of bundle deformation , encoded by @xmath1 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : shape ] ) , filaments have to slip relative to each other , bringing the crosslinking sites out of registry and therefore leading to crosslink deformation .",
    "the slip is given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the local tangent angle of the bundle at the site of the crosslink @xmath27 .",
    "bringing the crosslinking sites back into registry is possible if one of the filaments stretches out farther than its connected partner , @xmath28 , in order to compensate for the bending induced mismatch .",
    "the shear contribution to the elastic energy may thus be written as @xmath29 with @xmath30 the crosslink shear stiffness . in the above ,",
    "@xmath31 are the crosslink occupation variables : @xmath32 means that between beads @xmath17 and @xmath33 a crosslink exists , while @xmath34 means that no crosslink is present .",
    "a key ingredient of this work is the possibility of crosslink ( un)binding : the crosslink occupation variables @xmath35 are therefore fluctuating quantities ( in contrast to previous studies@xcite where they were quenched ) .",
    "we emphasize@xcite that eq .",
    "( [ eq : hx ] ) can also be derived by properly discretizing the shear energy of an elastic continuum with shear modulus  @xmath36 .",
    "the bundle model of the present study is thus defined by the hamiltonian @xmath37 i.e.  the sum of the stretch and shear contributions .",
    "hence , there is a competition between filament stretching and crosslink shearing which provides the fundamental physical mechanism that governs the phenomena to be described . in the sections to come",
    ", we will study eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) using mostly the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "that is , we fix the crosslink chemical potential @xmath38 , but the total number of crosslinks @xmath39 is allowed to fluctuate",
    ".      the key parameters in our model are the bending amplitude @xmath2 , the crosslink chemical potential @xmath38 , the number of filaments @xmath3 , and the spring constants @xmath40 .",

    "we choose @xmath43 , but the ratio @xmath44 will be varied ( irrelevant factors of @xmath45 are thus absorbed in the spring constants ) .",

    "we consider an end - grafted bundle , corresponding to the boundary condition @xmath48 .",

    "the figure strikingly shows the coexisting states at high and low crosslink density , and the formation of an interface upon passing over the intermediate saddle - point .",
    "the theory also reproduces the free energy barrier along lines of constant  @xmath20 ( inset ) , in line with the canonical simulations of fig .",
    "[ fig : ip ] .",
    "the transition pathway followed in these simulations is indicated by the light ( red ) points . after passing the saddle - point , at @xmath166 , the interface `` jumps '' from the center of the bundle to the distant end .",
    "it is interesting to compare this `` canonical '' pathway with the general shape of the basin of attraction into the bound state .",
    "this seems to favor a pathway closer to the diagonal , with an associated continuous motion of the interface .    from eq",
    "( [ eq : fall ] ) it is straightforward to calculate the average crosslink density @xmath53 , as well as the average location of the interface @xmath167 .",
    "both are compared to simulation results in fig .",
    "[ avg.n.nf2 ] , and the agreement is remarkably good : as the bending amplitude increases , there is a discontinuous jump in both the crosslink density , as well as in the interface position .",
    "let us now turn to bundles with more than two filaments .",
    "the simulations have indicated a sequence of @xmath92 transitions , one transition for each adjacent filament pair ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qp ] ) . upon increasing the bundle deformation @xmath2 , the crosslinks in the central filament pair unbind first .",
    "this unbinding transition leaves two smaller weakly coupled sub - bundles .",
    "the successive transitions then happen in the centers of these sub - bundles up until all filament pairs are unbound .",
    "as with each filament pair the number of variational parameters increases , a full theoretical treatment becomes intractable .",
    "we therefore choose a semi - analytic treatment that explicitly accounts for crosslinks in the respective central layer only .",
    "the stretching degrees of freedom that do not belong to this layer are integrated out by assuming@xcite @xmath169 independent of the layer index  @xmath77 .",
    "this indicates that filament stretching increases approximately linearly with the filament index , i.e.  with the distance from the center of the bundle ( filaments farther out from the center `` inherit '' the stretching from all the filaments on the inside ) .",
    "such a linear dependence constitutes a central assumption in classical continuum theories , such as euler - bernoulli or timoshenko beam theories  @xcite . for sufficiently stiff crosslinks , and without considering the possibility of an interface ( @xmath156 )",
    ", this model can be mapped onto a two - filament bundle , conform eq .",
    "( [ eq : fmodel.z1 ] ) , with effective @xmath3-dependent parameters , @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "we then use these @xmath3-dependent parameters in the full free energy of eq .",

    "[ avg.n.nf2.4.6 ] compares the result of this calculation ( curves ) with simulation data ( symbols ) for the case @xmath88 .",
    "the middle curve shows the average crosslink density @xmath53 of the entire bundle versus bending amplitude @xmath2 : the agreement with the simulations is quite remarkable .",
    "the lower curve shows the average crosslink density in the central layer , which unbinds at @xmath172 .",
    "here , the theory slightly underestimates the simulation results , but the location of the transition is accurately reproduced .",
    "the upper curve shows @xmath53 of the outer layer , which unbinds at a much larger bending amplitude @xmath173 .",
    "this curve is nearly equivalent to that of a bundle with @xmath52 filaments , in agreement with the binodal of fig .",
    "[ fig : bin4 ] .",
    "we have studied the response of a reversibly crosslinked filament bundle to an imposed bundle deformation . the central quantity was the average crosslink density @xmath53 and its dependence on the imposed curvature @xmath2 of the bundle backbone .",
    "as compared to simple langmuir adsorption , @xmath174 at chemical potential @xmath38 , one expects a decreasing crosslink occupation with increasing bundle deformation .",
    "the reason is that bundle deformation leads to a mismatch between the crosslink binding sites , and therefore to an elastic energy cost for binding .",
    "we found this basic mechanism to indeed be true , but the detailed phenomenology of crosslink unbinding turns out to be surprisingly rich and goes beyond a simple shift of the equilibrium state as would be characterized , for example , by an effective chemical potential .",
    "our main result is the possibility of a cooperative and discontinuous reduction of crosslink occupation as the bundle deformation is increased .",
    "the reason for this behavior is the competition between the energy scales of crosslink shear @xmath30 , and filament stretch @xmath15 , which is particularly efficient when the crosslinks are stiff .",
    "an unbinding event will then affect the force balance in the filaments , with the potential of influencing the bundle state far away from the unbinding site .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath30 is small and the crosslinks soft , crosslinks unbind one after the other leading to a smooth decrease of the average crosslink occupation .",
    "we have characterized in detail the discontinuous unbinding transition and identified the existence of an interface ; the latter separates a region of high crosslink density from a region essentially free of crosslinks .",
    "the formation of an interface is a collective process in which crosslinks have to reorganize within the bundle and find new binding sites .",
    "a similar effect has been discussed in the context of the twisting of helical filament bundles , where crosslinks organize into certain `` binding zones ''  @xcite .",
    "as one increases the bundle twist away from its preferred value , these binding zones become shorter and shorter , thus necessitating collective reorganizations of many crosslinks simultaneously . as evidenced in fig .",
    "[ fig : ip ] , such a process implies the crossing of a free energy barrier . the associated time - scale of escape over the barrier may be much longer compared to single crosslink ( un)binding events .",
    "such long time - scales may indeed be present in a recent experiment with f - actin bundles crosslinked by @xmath27-actinin@xcite . in the experiment",
    "a bundle was brought into a deformed configuration , where it was kept for either ten or @xmath175 seconds .",
    "after this waiting time the bundle was released and its relaxation was monitored . for the shorter waiting time",
    "the bundle showed the expected exponential relaxation into the straight ground state .",
    "for the longer waiting time , however , the bundle did not relax back , but remained in a state with a considerable residual bending deformation .",
    "apparently , upon bundle deformation , new binding sites become available that stabilize the bent shape by allowing the crosslinks to rebind in more favorable states that avoid crosslink straining . after releasing the bundle these crosslinks act to stabilize the bent contour , thus leading to a plastically deformed bundle , where the ground - state is no longer straight@xcite . in line with our interpretation in terms of a free energy barrier ,",
    "the apparent time - scale ( the waiting time ) necessary to observe bundle plasticity was considerably longer than the time required for ( un)binding of the individual @xmath27-actinin linkers , which is on the order of seconds@xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , our model does not allow for plastic deformation as the crosslinks are assumed to always bind to the same , initial binding sites : a crosslink at site @xmath27 only binds to the site @xmath27 on the next filament .",
    "we explicitly exclude the binding of crosslinks between non - neighboring sites , e.g.  between @xmath27 and @xmath176 .",
    "if the bending - induced mismatch , @xmath25 , between the original sites at @xmath27 is large , those `` new '' sites may actually be more favorable in terms of crosslink energy .",
    "binding to new sites may then help to `` freeze - in '' the applied bending deformation leading to a plastically deformed contour .",
    "such a model would pose a challenging problem for a theoretical analysis and has to be left for future work . instead , we propose a simple mapping that allows us to incorporate bundle plasticity into the `` elastic '' bundle model presented in this work .    to this end",
    ", we assume the new binding sites to be optimal , in the sense that for the given imposed bundle contour no elastic energy cost is associated with the rebinding of a crosslink . reshuffling a crosslink from its original position to a new site",
    "may then be conceived of as being an unbinding event at zero chemical potential . for simplicity",
    ", we further assume that rebinding is fast enough , such that all crosslinks are either bound to original sites or to new sites . in this case",
    ", the number of crosslinks bound to new sites , @xmath177 , can be inferred without further calculation from the results presented in this work , @xmath178 .",
    "if we now release the bundle from its deformed state , filament elasticity will try to relax the bundle back to its original unbent state .",
    "the population of newly bound crosslinks , however , acts against this relaxation and stabilizes the bent contour . within our assumption",
    "the additional contribution to the crosslink shear energy is @xmath179 where we assumed @xmath52 for simplicity . here",
    ", @xmath180 is the tangent in the _ reference _ configuration at position @xmath27 that was imposed during the waiting time , while @xmath136 corresponds to the tangent acquired during the relaxation process .",
    "as can be seen , the magnitude of the stabilizing effect depends on @xmath177 , which depends on the waiting time .",
    "if the crosslink is stiff enough , such that a free energy barrier is present , fast thermalization is prevented . in this case",
    "@xmath181 on short time - scales and the bundle will behave elastically . on time",
    "- scales long compared to the escape time over the barrier , the number of crosslinks bound to new sites reaches its equilibrium value , @xmath182 , and the bundle is maximally plastic . in the experiment of ref .",
    "only two waiting times were accessible",
    ". it would be interesting to systematically change the experimental time - scale .",
    "one possibility could be to introduce a rate , at which bundle deformation is increased . in the context of protein unfolding , similar experiments@xcite",
