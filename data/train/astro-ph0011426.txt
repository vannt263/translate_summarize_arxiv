    "recent observations of high - redshift objects have revealed dynamical aspects of the evolving universe .",
    "measurements of lyman - break galaxies provide evidences for the early galaxy assembly at the epoch @xmath1 , which put a serious constraint on the structure formation scenario ( steidal et al . 1998 ; giavalisco et al .",
    "clusters up to @xmath2 have been observed , and the abundance suggests the universe with a low density parameter @xmath3 ( e.g , carlberg et al .",
    "moreover , the upcoming wide - field surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the two - degree field ( 2df ) survey promise to extend the observable scale of the universe and these enormous data will precisely reveal the clustering feature of the high - redshift quasars and galaxies .",
    "since the analysis combining different redshift data sets has a potential to break the degeneracy of the cosmological parameters , as well as to provide the strong constraints on the structure formation scenario , statistical studies using the high - redshift objects are of great importance as a complementary to the measurements of cosmic microwave background anisotropy and the detection of cosmic shear .",
    "recently several authors have discussed various cosmological effects arising from proper observations of the high - redshift objects ( e.g , suto et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) .",
    "apart from the biasing of the luminous objects , the main effects are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "geometric distortion : no one can obtain the correct three - dimensional map of the high - redshift objects without knowing the correct cosmological model of the universe .",
    "the uncertainty of the cosmological model may affect proper evaluation of the clustering pattern in the _ cosmological redshift space _",
    "( alcock & paczyski 1979 ) .",
    "redshift - space distortion : peculiar motion of a cosmological object affects the estimation of the distance in a redshift survey , which causes the linear redshift - space distortion due to the bulk motion and the nonlinear velocity distortion due to the virialized random motion ( finger - of - god effect ) ( davis & peebles 1983 ; kaiser 1987 ; suto & suginohara 1991 ; hamilton 1998 for a review ) .",
    "light - cone effect : because an entire sample does not consist of objects on a constant - time hypersurface but on a light cone , the redshift evolution of the objects inevitably contaminates the data .",
    "therefore , in a wide and deep survey , it becomes important to incorporate the light - cone effect into statistical quantities , for example , two - point correlation function and the power spectrum ( matarrese et al . 1997 ; yamamoto & suto 1999 ) .",
    "for the popular two - point statistics , the significance of these effects have been studied in detail and the robustness of the theoretical prediction is checked by the numerical simulation ( ballinger et al .",
    "1996 ; matsubara & suto 1996 ; magira et al . 2000 ; hamana et al .",
    "2000 ) . using the theoretical formulae ,",
    "the feasibility of cosmological test with geometric distortion has been investigated ( yamamoto , nishioka & taruya 2000 ) .",
    "further , the analysis is developed to the higher - order moments on a light - cone ( matsubara et al .",
    "1997 ) .    here",
    "we extend these analyses to the isodensity statistics .",
    "that is , we investigate the influences of the above cosmological effects on the isodensity statistics , which have not been ever clarified .",
    "the isodensity statistics like the genus @xmath4 and area statistic @xmath5 have progressively become important as a quantitative measure of the topology of the large - scale structure .",
    "analytical expressions of the isodensity statistics are derived for the gaussian random field and some cases of non - gaussian field in real space ( e.g , bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ; hamilton et al . 1986 ; matsubara 1994 , 2000 ; matsubara & yokoyama 1996 ) . with these analytic formulae ,",
    "the isodensity statistics computed from the redshift surveys of galaxies and/or the simulated dark matter catalogues are comprehensively understood ( colley et al . 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "while most authors of these works have focused on the low - redshift objects except for the cosmic microwave background anisotropy , the analysis using the high - redshift samples is expected to provide an important clue on the origin and evolution of proto - galaxies and proto - clusters .",
    "in fact , park et al . ( 2000 ) have recently analyzed the two - dimensional genus using the galaxies taken from the hubble deep field and quantified the feature of early galaxy assembly .",
    "remarkably , their samples are widely distributed over the redshift range @xmath6 , which revealed an unprecedentedly deep view of galaxy clustering .",
    "although the analysis is still limited to the projected density field because of the large error of photometric redshift , precise measurement of redshift will enable us to quantify the various isodensity statistics defined in the three - dimensional space , as well as the quantities in the one- and two - dimensional space in near future .",
    "practically , the observed distribution of high - redshift objects suffers from the cosmological effects , which should be correctly taken into account when comparing such data with theoretical prediction .",
    "then naive but important questions are as follows : how the cosmological effects affect the statistical study of isodensity contour ; whether these effects are observed as signal or noise .",
    "purpose of this paper is to address these issues by using a simple theoretical formulae for the isodensity statistics , in which the cosmological effects are faithfully incorporated .",
    "partially , the influence of the linear ( redshift - space ) distortion is investigated by matsubara ( 1996 ) , though the effect turns out to be small . in his paper",
    "the corrections from the nonlinear clustering and the nonlinear velocity distortion , which become influential on small length scales , are not investigated , and neither is the geometric distortion .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize the matsubara s results to those incorporating the geometric distortion effect and the nonlinear correction taking account of the smoothing effect . with the extended formulae ,",
    "we examine how the geometric and redshift - space distortions affect the isodensity statistics qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "we will show that the nonlinear effect can be important even for a case with large smoothing scale because the scaling effect of the geometric distortion causes apparent enhancement of the nonlinear effects , which depends on choice of the cosmological redshift space .",
    "in addition we also discuss the sampling noise and the effect of finite redshift depth for typical high - redshift samples by using our extended formulae .",
    "we organized the paper as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : cosmological redshift space ] , the cosmological redshift - space coordinate is introduced , and the statistical quantities incorporating the nonlinear corrections are described .",
    "then we consider the isodensity statistics in cosmological redshift space in section [ sec : isodensity ] .",
    "based on the analytic formulae for the gaussian field in appendix [ appendix : gaussian results ] , we present a nonlinear model of isodensity statistics . after demonstrating predictions of the model , sensitivity of the isodensity statistics and the effect of the light - cone",

    ", suppose that we could only know radial distances of objects in terms of the redshift @xmath17 and separations between pairs of objects in terms of the angular diameter distances .",
    "this means that the relation between the comoving real space and the observable redshift space inherently depends on an assumption of the cosmological model of the universe , and that the radial component of peculiar velocities of the objects apparently alters the distribution in the observed redshift space .    hereafter ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , we will assume that the sample of objects located in the range @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 whose angular separations are of the order of @xmath21 . then , the distant - observer approximation is entirely valid . within this approximation",

    "influences of the nonlinear corrections and the geometric distortion are quantitatively examined in familiar cold dark matter cosmological models .",
    "first consider the three - dimensional genus curve .",

    "they showed that the probability density distribution of one - point statistics can be empirically fitted by the log - normal distribution function to a good accuracy ( kofman et al .",
    "1994 ; bernardeau & kofman 1995 ; taylor & watts 2000 ) .",
    "this is also the case in the redshift space ( hui et al . 2000 ) .",
    "observationally , the log - normal distribution function has been used as a model of the galaxy distribution ever since hubble ( 1934 ) ( e.g , hamilton 1985 ; bouchet et al .",
    "1993 ; kofman et al .",
    "hence , we might use the log - normal function as a good approximation for the actual observed distribution .",
    "the above formulae state that the amplitude of the isodensity statistics depends on the geometric and the peculiar velocity effects , whose influences are characterized by the parameter @xmath124 .",
    "the sensitivity to those effects can be understood from the function @xmath123 , @xmath10 and @xmath107 . in figure",
    "[ fig : jkl ] , we plot the normalized amplitude @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 as the functions of distortion parameter @xmath124 . to show the angle dependence of the functions @xmath10 and @xmath107 , we plot the cases @xmath133 ( solid ) , @xmath134 ( long - dashed ) , @xmath135 ( short - dashed ) and @xmath136 ( dotted ) .",
    "figure [ fig : jkl ] suggests that the distortion effects may significantly affect the isodensity statistics , especially for the quantities described by the function @xmath137 , i.e. , @xmath115 and @xmath106 . in next subsection , we will clarify how @xmath124 is varied by the distortion effects at a quantitative level .    before proceeding the analysis ,",
    "it should be noted that isodensity statistics in terms of the volume fraction @xmath138 defined by @xmath139 instead of the density threshold @xmath101 , has been conventionally used in order to compare the gaussian results with non - gaussian cases ( e.g , gott et al .",
    "1989 ; vogely et al .",
    "1994 ; canavezes et al . 1998 ) .",
    "in fact , the isodensity statistics labeled by @xmath138 remains unchanged under the transformation ( [ eq : del - phi ] ) in real space .",
    "in cosmological redshift space , however , the statistics can not be entirely characterized by the volume fraction because of the anisotropy .",
    "moreover , we intend to clarify influences of the distortion effects including the nonlinear correction .",
    "therefore , we use the straightforward expressions labeled by the density threshold @xmath101 .      adopting the above nonlinear model",
    ", we now give a prediction for isodensity statistics in specific cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmological models . in this paper",
    ", we consider two typical cdm models , in which the cosmological parameters are chosen as @xmath140 ( scdm model ) and @xmath141 ( lcdm model ) , where @xmath142 , the top - hat mass fluctuation amplitude at @xmath143mpc , is normalized by the cluster abundance ( e.g , kitayama & suto 1997 ) .",
    "for the unknown biasing factor , we use the time - evolving biasing model by fry ( 1996 ) .",
    "this model simply accounts for the redshift evolution of number density fluctuations in the case that the formation and merging process can be negligible .",

    "therefore we first analyze @xmath124 and @xmath58 .",
    "figures [ fig : gamma_hubble ] and [ fig : gamma_eds ] show @xmath124 and @xmath58 as the functions of the smoothing radius @xmath40 .",
    "figure [ fig : gamma_hubble ] shows the case adopting the cosmological redshift space with @xmath36 ( see eqs.[[eq : shb ] ] and [ [ eq : z_crd ] ] ) .",
    "the results are depicted for the lcdm model ( _ upper - panel _ ) and the scdm model ( _ lower - panel _ ) , though the two models show almost similar behaviors . in each model the results at @xmath148 ( _ left - panel _ ) and @xmath149 ( _ right - panel _ ) are shown .    on each panel the solid line plots the case",
    "all the effects are incorporated . because the solid line corresponds to the case observed in the space @xmath24 , which is referred to @xmath24-space on the panel .",
    "the solid line shows that the distortion parameter @xmath124 ( the clustering amplitude @xmath58 ) gradually increases ( decreases ) as the smoothing scale @xmath40 increases . to understand the importance of the nonlinear and the geometric distortion effects",

    "the latter case corresponds to the result obtained in the @xmath48-space ( see eq.[[eq : s_vs_x ] ] ) , which is the same result obtained in the @xmath24-space with setting @xmath126 .    by comparing the behaviors of the solid and the dot - dashed lines for @xmath124 on large smoothing scales , where the linear distortion and the geometric distortion are influential",
    ", it is apparent that the linear distortion increases @xmath124 and that the geometric distortion decreases @xmath124 . on the other hand",
    "the nonlinear correction becomes important on small scales ( compare _ solid _ and _ dashed _ lines ) .",
    "it appears that the nonlinear effects cause more significant influence on the distortion parameter @xmath124 rather than the clustering amplitude @xmath58 .",
    "this is because the finger - of - god effect compensates the gravitational nonlinear growth and the resultant @xmath58 becomes almost same as the linear result . as for @xmath124 , since the finger - of - god effect dominates the linear velocity distortion on small scales , @xmath124 is significantly decreased .",
    "it is notable that the correction from nonlinear effects still remains non - negligible even at the larger smoothing length @xmath150mpc in the cosmological redshift space @xmath151 .",
    "this behavior is caused from the scaling effect of the geometric distortion through the factors @xmath30 and @xmath29 .",
    "note also that the difference between the solid line and the dot - dashed line becomes significant at higher redshift @xmath149 , which also indicates the importance of the geometric distortion effect at the higher redshift .",
    "figure [ fig : gamma_eds ] shows another example , where the cosmological redshift space is chosen as @xmath38 ( see eqs.[[eq : seds ] ] and [ [ eq : eds_crd ] ] ) .",
    "in contrast with the case @xmath36 in figure [ fig : gamma_hubble]a , the geometric distortion increases @xmath124 and suppresses the amplitude @xmath58 in the case of the lcdm model ( _ upper - panel _ ) . for the scdm case ,",
    "the results in @xmath24-space exactly coincides with those in @xmath48-space because the cosmological redshift space coincide with the comoving real space and the geometric distortion is absent . in both cases ,",
    "correction from the nonlinear effects becomes negligible on the scales @xmath152mpc at high - redshift .",
    "this is also true irrespective of whether the cosmological model of the real space is spatially flat or open .    for comparison , in figure [ fig : gamma_hubble ] and [ fig : gamma_eds ] , the case of no bias",
    "is also shown by setting @xmath153 ( _ dotted line _ ) .",
    "this alternation does not change the qualitative behavior , however , we can see that @xmath124 and @xmath58 are affected by the amplitude of the bias as follows .",
    "increasing the amplitude of the biasing factor , @xmath124 is decreased , conversely @xmath58 is increased .",
    "this effect could be more significant at higher redshift because of time - evolution of the bias .",
    "in principle , behaviors of the isodensity statistics can be entirely understood from figure [ fig : jkl ] , [ fig : gamma_hubble ] , and [ fig : gamma_eds ] . as a demonstration , however , in figure [ fig : gncurve1 ] we plot shape - dependence of the genus @xmath4  ( _ upper panels _ ) and @xmath115  ( _ lower panels _ ) as functions of the density height @xmath101 for the lcdm model .",

    "@xmath36 , the significance of the nonlinear correction leads to asymmetric shapes of the isodensity statistics even at the large smoothing length @xmath154mpc and at high - redshift .",
    "the relative amplitude of @xmath115 and @xmath106 is sensitive to the angle @xmath99 , which might be a useful tool to determine the cosmological model of our universe as a simple geometric test ( alcock & paczyski 1978 ; see sec.[sec : conclusion ] ) . on the other hand , in the case @xmath38 ,",
    "all the statistics have nearly symmetric shape .",
    "this indicates that the gaussian linear results could be a good approximation .",
    "interestingly , at high - redshift @xmath149 , the relative amplitude of the isodensity statistics has the opposite @xmath99-dependence in the case @xmath38 , compared to the one in the case @xmath36 .",

    "this fact causes the opposite @xmath99-dependence , as is easily deduced from figure [ fig : jkl ] .",
    "the analysis in previous section shows that the anisotropy caused by the geometric and the velocity distortions systematically affect the amplitude of the one- and two - dimensional quantities with the fractional power by @xmath157 .",
    "for the three - dimensional quantities @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the scaling effect by the geometric distortion enhances or reduces the nonlinearity .",
    "these results are qualitatively correct as long as a large number of samples are distributed within a narrow range of the redshift . in this section , for practical purpose , we focus on the following issues : detectability of these effects ( subsection [ subsec : sensitivity ] ) ; influence of finite redshift range of samples , i.e , the light - cone effect ( subsection [ subsec : light - cone ] ) .      for quantitative study of high - redshift clustering , we must be careful for the poisson noise and the sampling noise as the main statistical errors .",
    "this is not an exception for the case of isodensity statistics .",
    "while the sampling noise arises from finiteness of the sampling volume , the poisson noise masks the isodensity statistics of underlying density fluctuations when the samples of cosmological objects are sparse and rare . in this subsection , to compare the errors with the systematic effects of geometric and redshift - space distortions , we roughly estimate both errors in an analytical manner , and investigate sensitivity of the isodensity statistics assuming typical high - redshift samples .",
    "let us first estimate the poisson noise . for simplicity , we consider the isodensity statistics for the gaussian random fields .",
    "the analytic formulae in appendix [ appendix : gaussian results ] reveal that the amplitude of the isodensity statistics can be written in a general form : @xmath158^{i/2 } ,   \\label{eq : amplitude}\\ ] ] where @xmath159 for @xmath4 , @xmath160 for @xmath115 , and @xmath161 for the area statistics , and we defined @xmath162 with the gaussian window function @xmath163 . in the expression ( [ eq : amplitude ] ) , we have simply ignored the anisotropy due to the redshift - space distortions .",
    "the influence of the poisson noise can be roughly evaluated as follows .",
    "the effect of the poisson sampling is incorporated by adding the shot - noise power spectrum ( e.g. , feldman , kaiser & peacock 1994 ) @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the mean number density of the observed high - redshift objects .",
    "then we insert the following power spectrum @xmath166 into equation ( [ eq : k - mode_correlation ] ) , @xmath167 where @xmath168 means the spectrum free from the shot noise . by substituting equation ( [ eq : power_poisson ] ) into ( [ eq : amplitude ] )",
    ", we can evaluate the ratio of @xmath169 incorporating the poisson term to the one neglecting it ( canavezes et al .",
    "1998 ) . here",
    "we consider the case that the spectrum is given in the power low form @xmath170 in the cosmological redshift space for simplicity .",
    "this yields the correlation function of the form @xmath171 where @xmath172 is a correlation length",
    ". then the ratio of @xmath169 reduces to @xmath173 where the last line is valid as long as the contribution from the poisson noise term is small compared with the dominant contribution from the gaussian random field .",
    "thus the quantity defined by @xmath174 qualitatively gives signal - to - noise ratio resulting from the poisson noise contribution .    on the other hand , in estimating the sampling noise",
    ", a reliable and robust method is the numerical technique of bootstrap re - sampling , which has been widely used in the observational / numerical study of genus statistics .",
    "although analytical estimation of sampling noise is rather difficult task , we can roughly infer the influence of finite sampling effect from _ number of resolution elements _ @xmath175 which provides a useful measure for the statistical power of isodensity statistics ( gott et al .",
    "1989 ; canavezes et al . 1998 ) . for a given redshift range of the sample region @xmath176",
    "$ ] , we have @xmath177 where @xmath178 denotes a fixed solid angle .",
    "gott et al .",
    "( 1989 ) introduced this quantity to discuss the quality of data sets and argued that for a fractional accuracy of @xmath179 in measuring the genus curve , a sample with @xmath180 is required . for a measurement with high fractional accuracy of @xmath181 few @xmath182 , large number of resolution element @xmath183",
    "is necessary .",
    "note that in a recent study of point source catalogue redshift survey of _ iras _ galaxies , number of resolution element reaches more than @xmath184 ( canavezes et al .",
    "1998 ) . in this paper",
    ", we use the quantity @xmath175 to estimate the influence of the sampling noise .",
    "table 1 summarizes the signal - to - shot noise ratio ( [ eq : s / n ] ) and the number of resolution element ( [ eq : nres ] ) assuming the typical samples of cosmological objects , sdss/2df quasars , lyman - break galaxies , and cluster samples .",
    "here , we also list the sdss/2df galaxies as a representative low - z sample .",
    "typical values of the correlation length @xmath172 and the mean number density @xmath165 are adopted to evaluate @xmath185 . to compute the quantity @xmath175",
    ", we assume the cosmological redshift space @xmath38 and set the solid angle @xmath178 by @xmath186 steradian for the sdss/2df galaxies , quasars and clusters , @xmath187 square degree for the lyman - break galaxies . from table 1 , it is clear that the sdss/2df galaxy redshift surveys unambiguously provide us high quality data preferable to an analysis of the isodensity statistics . for our interest of high - redshift samples",
    ", the cluster samples can be good objects for studying the isodensity statistics .",
    "the systematic cosmological effects can dominate the poisson and the sampling noise , and may act as signal . as for the lyman - break galaxies , while the high signal - to - noise ratio @xmath185 could be attained , the sampling error can dominate the signal due to the narrow field of sample region . in an optimistic sense , this is not a problem when the wide - field samples are supplied .",
    "the photometric sdss galaxies beyond @xmath188 might be a candidate of such samples if the redshifts of objects are precisely measured , although the redshift range will be shallower @xmath189 .",
    "on the other hand , the quasar samples would be rather sparse and the poisson noise unfortunately dominates the signal , though the sampling error becomes negligible .",
    "the above estimation of statistical errors might be rather optimistic and idealistic .",
    "we do not consider the selection effect and the boundary effect of the survey region .",
    "further , we should be aware that strength of cosmological effects as well as the statistical errors also depend on the biasing of objects , which might be one of the most important obstacle in estimating the sensitivity . in a rigorous sense",
    ", we can not give any conclusive statements until elaborating a more quantitative study using numerical simulation , however , we can say that the systematic effects of geometric and velocity distortions can not be entirely negligible .",
    "the isodensity statistics on clustering of high - redshift objects will be measured from the cluster samples , in addition to the high - z galaxies from the future wide - field surveys .",
    "table 1 suggests that observations of a large volume region is more desirable to reduce the sampling noise . in this case , the redshift range of the samples becomes large , and the influence of the light - cone effect will be important .",
    "namely , the time - evolution of the distribution of the objects should be properly taken into account . the light - cone effect on the two - point correlation function and power spectrum",
    "is rigorously formulated by yamamoto & suto ( 1999 ) and the effect is extensively investigated in various cosmological situations ( nishioka & yamamoto 1999 , 2000 ; yamamoto et al .",
    "1999 ; suto et al .",
    "2000a , b ) .    unlike the two - point statistics , which are computed from the pair - count of objects with a fixed separation",
    ", the isodensity statistics can be estimated from the pixelated density fields .",
    "this situation is similar to the analysis of the higher order moments using the count - in - cell method ( matsubara et al .",
    "1997 ) . in this case ,",
    "as long as the distant - observer approximation is valid , the light - cone effect is supposed to be incorporated into the isodensity statistics as follows : @xmath190 where @xmath191 denotes the @xmath192-dimensional genus statistics at redshift @xmath17 , @xmath193 is the comoving volume element in @xmath192-dimensional ( cosmological redshift ) space , and @xmath194 is a weight function . in general , the weight function @xmath194 arising from the selection effect is determined so as to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio . as stated in suto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the pixelated density field at @xmath17 is corrected by multiplying the inverse of the selection function @xmath195 for the density fields and @xmath194 can be set to unity for @xmath196 , in principle .",
    "this is actually done when we compute the genus curves from the observational data ( e.g , canavezes et al .",
    "hence , we simply set @xmath197 .",
    "the formula ( [ eq : light - cone ] ) can also be applicable to the area statistics by replacing @xmath191 with @xmath198 , the @xmath192-dimensional area statistics .    in the above expression ( [ eq : light - cone ] ) , the range of the integration @xmath199 $ ] and the volume factor @xmath193 should be determined depending on geometry of the survey depth for the three dimensional statistics , and also depending on configuration of a plane ( line ) underlying the density fields for the two ( one ) dimensional statistics . as an example , let us consider the case that samples are distributed in the range of the radial distance @xmath200 within a fixed solid angle @xmath201 . in this case , the @xmath192-dimensional volume factor becomes @xmath202    as a demonstration , in figure [ fig : lceffect_g3 ] , we plot the three - dimensional genus @xmath203 for the lyman - break galaxies ( lower panels ) and the high - redshift clusters ( middle panels ) as typical high - z samples , and the sdss/2df galaxies ( upper panels ) as a reference .",
    "we adopted the parameters of the redshift range of the samples and the smoothing radius listed in table 1 .",
    "the left and right panels show the cases @xmath36 and @xmath38 , respectively . for each panel ,",
    "solid lines show the genus curves incorporating the light - cone effect , @xmath204 . on the other hand",
    "the dashed and dotted lines show the ones on a constant hypersurface at @xmath205 and @xmath206 , i.e. , @xmath207 and @xmath208 , respectively . in the similar way ,",
    "figure [ fig : lceffect_g2 ] shows the two - dimensional genus @xmath209 . in the case of the two - dimensional genus @xmath115 , the two - dimensional slice @xmath97 embedded in a survey field is taken to be parallel to the line - of - sight direction , i.e. , @xmath133 .    from figures [ fig : lceffect_g3 ] and [ fig :",
    "lceffect_g2 ] , we might regard that the light - cone effect is not significant for these samples .",
    "that is , as long as the samples listed in table 1 are concerned , the light - cone effect on the shapes of isodensity statistics is not so significant",
    ". this might be because we focused on the shape of the isodensity statistics normalized by the amplitude at the threshold @xmath210 and/or @xmath211 , which is sensitive to probability distribution function of the random field , rather than that of the clustering amplitude . at a high - redshift and/or with a large smoothing radius , the probability distribution as a function of the threshold @xmath101 merely has the weak dependence of time .",
    "this consideration suggests that the light - cone effect becomes important for smoothing scales on a boundary between linear and nonlinear regimes , where the evolution of the probability distribution function can be drastic .",
    "in the present paper , we have considered various observational effects on the isodensity statistics of high - redshift objects , and estimated their influences , as a generalization of the work by matsubara ( 1996 ) .",
    "we have presented a simple theoretical model incorporating the geometric distortion and the nonlinear correction arising from the gravitational growth and the finger - of - god effects , together with useful analytic formulae . from this theoretical model ( [ eq : g_log])([eq : n1_log ] ) , we have demonstrated that the geometric distortion affects the shapes of the isodensity statistics and that the nonlinear correction can be sensitive to a choice of the redshift - space coordinate as increasing the redshift .",
    "based on these results , we have briefly discussed the detectability of these effects by evaluating the shot - noise and the sampling noise contaminations .",
    "furthermore , the influence of the light - cone effect has been investigated .",
    "the important conclusions are summarized :    1 .",
    "when the cosmological redshift space @xmath36 ( eqs.[[eq : shb ] ] and [ [ eq : z_crd ] ] ) is chosen , the nonlinear correction has an effect on the isodensity statistics for smoothing length larger @xmath154mpc even at the higher redshift @xmath212 , where the isodensity statistics have asymmetric shapes . on the other hand , when the cosmological redshift space @xmath38 ( eqs.[[eq : seds ] ] and [ [ eq : eds_crd ] ] ) is chosen , the nonlinear correction turns out to be small and the linear theory of redshift - space distortions using the gaussian results ( [ eq : g3_gauss ] ) , ( [ eq : g2_gauss ] ) and ( [ eq : n3_gauss])-([eq : n1_gauss ] ) could be a good approximation for the large smoothing scales . in both cases ,",
    "the geometric and velocity distortions cause the angle - dependence in the low - dimensional quantities , and the relative amplitude can be changed by @xmath0 .",
    "the poisson sampling error is crucial for the sparse sampling of high - redshift objects like the ( sdss/2df ) quasars .",
    "the finiteness of the sampling volume might affect the precise measurement of isodensity statistics with lyman - break galaxies . though more quantitative estimation of statistical errors using numerical simulations is needed",
    ", however , the isodensity statistics can be tested using clusters and high - z galaxies from future wide - field surveys . for these samples ,",
    "the cosmological effects can be comparable or could be dominant to the poisson and the sampling noise .",
    "3 .   for a sample",
    "that the survey volume is large and the cosmological objects are distributed in a wide range of redshift , the light - cone effect can be influential .",
    "however , we infer that the light - cone effect has a weak influence on the isodensity statistics as long as the time evolution of the probability distribution function is not drastic , though this picture might depend on the evolution of the biasing factor .    because the model presented here are quite simple , the predictions should be checked by numerical simulations .",
    "the prediction can also be sophisticated by using more reliable nonlinear models deduced from the simulations .",
    "recent development of cosmological n - body simulation enables us to obtain the enormous large volume data over a few gpc ( colberg et al .",
    "the larger data comparable to the hubble volume size will provide us with chances of quantitative studies for the isodensity statistics , as well as the two - point statistics , in which the light - cone effect inevitably becomes important .",
    "combining our theoretical template with these simulations , various cosmological implications might be yielded .",
    "one of the most interesting application is the geometric test proposed by alcock & paczyski ( 1979 ) . as we have seen in sec.[subsec : results ] , the geometric distortion makes the observed structures distorted and it causes deformation of the isodensity contour .",
    "since this effect is sensitive to the distance - redshift relation , the anisotropy of isodensity statistics might be a useful tool in investigating cosmological models , as well as the anisotropy of two - point statistics ( yamamoto , nishioka & taruya 2000 ) .",
    "the present theoretical formulae include useful tools for quantifying the geometric distortion , as well as for testing statistical nature of biased density fields .",
    "to address these issues , however , a more quantitative analysis should be developed .",
    "the uncertainty of the biasing can be a critical issue to clarify the topological features of large - scale structure . throughout the analyses ,",
    "we have put the linear biasing ansatz ( [ eq : bias ] ) and the evolution of the biasing simply given by the model ( [ eq : frybias ] ) neglecting the merging and formation processes . in more realistic situation ,",
    "the biasing of luminous objects is nonlinear and stochastic ( dekel & lahav 1999 ) and the merging and formation processes might alter the evolution of biasing ( e.g , somerville et al .",
    "2000 ; taruya et al .",
    "however , recent theoretical and numerical studies suggest that the linear biasing assumption ( [ eq : bias ] ) can be a good approximation even in the quasi - linear regime ( coles , 1993 ; scherrer & weinberg 1998 ; matsubara 1999 ; taruya & suto 2000 ; taruya et al .",
    "therefore , in a qualitative sense , we believe that the present analyses would have revealed the generic feature of isodensity statistics on the observed high - redshift objects . as for the evolution of biasing ,",
    "the theoretical prediction based on the press - schechter formalism gives the biasing factor for the dark halo distribution accurately ( mo & white 1996 ; jing 1998 ; sheth & tormen 1999 ) .",
    "incorporating this evolution model into our analytic formulae can provide a powerful tool for quantifying the distribution of clusters of galaxies . in any way the isodensity statistics may probe a distinctive aspect of the biasing factor .",
    "this will be discussed elsewhere ( hikage , taruya & suto 2000 , in preparation ) .",

    "<S> we discuss the systematic effects arising from the _ cosmological redshift - space ( geometric ) distortion _ on the statistical analysis of isodensity contour using high - redshift catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> especially , we present a simple theoretical model for isodensity statistics in cosmological redshift - space , as a generalization of the work by matsubara ( 1996 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical quantities considered here are the two- and three - dimensional genus of isodensity contour , the area of surface , the length of contour intersecting with a plane and the number of the crossing points of isodensity contour on a line . </S>",
    "<S> we give useful analytic formulae for the isodensity statistics , which take into account the corrections from the geometric distortion , the nonlinear clustering and the nonlinear velocity distortion phenomenologically . </S>",
    "<S> we then demonstrate how the geometric distortion and the nonlinear corrections alter shapes of the statistical quantities on the basis of plausible cosmological models . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the nonlinear correction can be sensitive to a choice of the redshift - space coordinate as increasing the redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the low - dimensional quantities such as two - dimensional genus systematically yield anisotropy due to the geometric and velocity distortions and their angle - dependence shows the @xmath0 difference of amplitude . sensitivity for typical high - redshift samples are estimated in an analytic manner , and the influence of the light - cone effect for the isodensity statistics is also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> a simple estimation suggests that the systematic effects of geometric and redshift - space distortions can become comparable or could be dominant to the statistical error of deep cluster samples and future high - redshift galaxy surveys . </S>",
    "<S> these systematic effects might be a useful tool in probing the cosmological model of our universe . </S>"
