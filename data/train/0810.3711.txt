    "since the discovery of the top quark in 1995 by the cdf and d  experiments  @xcite , the mass of the top quark has been measured with ever higher precision .",
    "the mass is an important parameter within the standard model ( sm ) and allows to infer the mass of the yet unobserved higgs boson .",
    "in addition , the top quark is the heaviest of the quarks known so far and with its yukawa coupling close to one , it may play a special role in electroweak symmetry breaking .    at the tevatron collider with a center - of - mass energy of 1.96 tev ,",
    "85  % of the top quark pairs are produced in quark - antiquark annihilation , while only 15  % originate from gluon pair fusion .",
    "since the top quark decays to almost 100  % in a charged @xmath2 boson and a bottom quark , the decay channels of the top - antitop events are classified according to the decays of the two @xmath2 bosons . the decay channel where each @xmath2 boson decays into a charged lepton and a neutrino is referred to as dilepton channel .",
    "the topology of this channel is described by two isolated energetic charged leptons , significant missing transverse energy , and two jets .",
    "the channel has the smallest branching ratio , but also the smallest background contamination .",
    "the main backgrounds to this final state are @xmath3+jets and diboson events ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "additional background comes from events in which a jet is misidentified as an electron and the production of heavy hadrons that decay into leptons which pass the isolation requirements .",
    "a systematic difference between top quark masses measured from different decay channels could indicate contributions from new processes beyond the sm .",
    "the reconstruction of the top mass from dilepton events poses a particular challenge as the two neutrinos from the @xmath2 boson decays are undetected . at the d  experiment ,",
    "two different methods are used to measure the top mass : the neutrino weighting method @xcite and the matrix element method @xcite . a brief introduction of both methods is given and their latest results are presented .",
    "the neutrino weighting method is a template based method and has already been used during the so - called run  i period of the tevatron accelerator . for each event ,",
    "the neutrino momenta are calculated assuming a certain top mass and different neutrino pseudorapidities .",
    "a weight @xmath5 is then assigned according to the agreement of the calculated sum of the neutrino momenta @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and the measured missing transverse momentum components @xmath8,@xmath9 in the event , given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 denote the resolution of the missing energy measurement .",
    "this process is repeated many times varying the jet and lepton energies within their experimental resolution .",
    "next , signal probability distribution functions ( pdf ) are built as a function of the top mass , the mean , and the rms of the weight distributions using monte carlo ( mc ) simulated signal events with different top masses . to reduce the bias from background contamination , a background pdf as a function of the mean and the rms of the weight distributions",
    "is calculated accordingly using simulated @xmath3+jets and diboson events .",
    "finally , a likelihood is used to measure the top mass , where the likelihood is a product of three terms .",
    "the first term accounts for the agreement of the expected number of signal and background mc events to the one in the data sample , the second for the agreement of the background events with the prediction , and the third for the agreement of the data with the signal and background pdf shapes .",
    "the method is calibrated using ensemble tests with monte carlo simulated events , where the size of the ensemble is equal to the size of the selected data sample .    for the measurement , events in the dilepton final state",
    "are selected requiring two charged leptons ( electron or muon ) , or alternatively one lepton , one charged particle track and at least one @xmath12 tagged jet .",
    "the data set analyzed corresponds to an integrated luminosity of about 1  fb@xmath13 collected between april 2002 and february 2006 with the d  detector .",
    "a kinematic selection is applied to reduce the contamination from background events and to achieve a good agreement between simulated and measured events .",
    "the top quark mass is extracted from 82 candidate events to be @xmath14 the main systematic uncertainties on this measurement come from the energy scale of the jets , the modeling of the simulated signal events using different mc generators , and the fragmentation of the @xmath12 jets .",
    "the matrix element method was developed by the d  collaboration during the run  i period of the tevatron to extract the top mass with high precision from a low statistics sample .",
    "still today the matrix element method yields the single most precise measurement of the top quark mass in the semileptonic decay channel .    the likelihood for a measured event @xmath15 to be produced via the signal process @xmath16 under the assumption of a certain top mass is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 denote the energy fraction of the incoming quarks from the protons and antiprotons , @xmath20 the parton distribution function of the proton , @xmath21 the center - of - mass energy squared , @xmath22 the leading - order matrix element @xcite and @xmath23 an element of the 6-body phase space .",
    "the finite detector resolution is taken into account using a transfer function @xmath24 that describes the probability to reconstruct a partonic final state @xmath25 as @xmath15 in the detector .",
    "the signal probability is normalized with the observable cross section @xmath26 .    in a similar way , for each event the probability to arise from the main background source ( z+2jets ) is calculated to reduce the bias coming from background events .",
    "both probabilities are then combined to an event probability @xmath27 where @xmath28denotes the signal fraction in the sample .",
    "the top quark mass is finally extracted from a likelihood fit of the product of the event by event probabilities . to calibrate the method and correct for any bias",
    ", monte carlo simulated events are used to perform ensemble tests .",
    "while only events with exactly one electron and exactly one muon in the final state are taken into account so far , the measurement makes use of the full run  ii data set recorded between april 2002 and may 2008 .",
    "this corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.8  fb@xmath13 . to reduce the fraction of background events and achieve a good agreement between simulated and measured events ,",
    "a kinematic selection is applied , leaving 107 selected data events .",
    "the top quark mass is measured to be @xmath29 the dominant sources of systematic uncertainties are jet uncertainties , such as their energy scale and resolution . with an statistical uncertainty of @xmath30  gev ,",
    "this measurement has the smallest uncertainty of all top mass measurements performed in the dilepton channel at the d  experiment so far .",
    "the top quark mass has been measured at the d  experiment with two different methods in the dilepton final state : the neutrino weighting and the matrix element method .",
    "uncertainties from the jet energy scale dominate the systematic uncertainties in both measurements .",
    "the best linear unbiased estimate ( blue ) method is used to combine both measurements @xcite .",
    "all uncertainties are taken to be fully correlated except for the statistical and fit uncertainties from the calibration curves . to combine the results of two orthogonal samples , the result from the neutrino weighting method in the channel with exactly one electron and exactly one muon",
    "is excluded and the preliminary combined result of the two methods yields a top quark mass of @xmath31 the current measurements and uncertainties on the top quark mass at the d  experiment , as well as the world average are shown in figure [ fig : topmass0808 ] @xcite . in a future update of the matrix element measurement using a larger data set , statistical uncertainties in the dilepton final state will be reduced significantly .",
    "thus , measurements in the dilepton channel will become more and more important determining the world average of the top quark mass .",
