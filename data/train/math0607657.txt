    "@xmath12    1 .",
    "@xmath87 , there exists constant @xmath88 , for arbitrary ball or cube @xmath66 with center @xmath7 , one has : @xmath89 .",
    "2 .   if an operator @xmath0 satisfies conditions ( 1.1 ) and ( 1.2 ) , then the following two conditions are equivalent : @xmath90    now , let us consider the action of approximation operators on atoms .",
    "let @xmath91 and let @xmath92 be the kernel distribution of @xmath93 .",

    "the proof of the above three conclusions in lemma  2.4 is similar , and so one proves only ( ii ) .",
    "let @xmath98 be the ball @xmath99 the ball with the same center and twice the radius and let @xmath100 .",

    "if @xmath0 is satisfying condition ( 1.6 ) , then there exists constant @xmath129 , and ( 2.6 ) is still true .",
    "the proof of ( ii ) is similar to that of ( i ) , so one proves only ( i ) .",
    "if @xmath13 , then applying lemmas 2.3 and 2.4 , the operators @xmath130 satisfy the condition ( 2.2 ) uniformly .",
    "then there exist an operator @xmath131 satisfying ( 1.1 ) , ( 1.2 ) and ( 2.2 ) , and a subsequence @xmath132 which converges to 0 such that @xmath133 in the sense of norm of ( 1.1 ) , ( 1.2 ) and ( 2.2 ) . according to lemma  2.3 , @xmath134 .",
    "further , choosing two test functions such that their supports are disjoint , one knows that the kernel distribution of @xmath135 vanishes out of the diagonal @xmath136 .",
    "then there exists a @xmath137 function @xmath138 such that , for arbitrary cube @xmath21 and @xmath20 and for arbitrary function @xmath139 , one has @xmath140    finally , if @xmath13 is satisfying condition ( 1.9 ) , by ( 2.7 ) , there exists constant @xmath63 such that , for arbitrary cube @xmath21 and @xmath96 , ( 2.6 ) is true .",
    "as to a c  z operator , usually , @xmath141 continuity is obtained by @xmath4 continuity ; but the @xmath4 continuity is often established by a fixed decomposition ( continuous or discrete ) of the operator .",
    "but when the regularity of @xmath11 is weakened to hrmander condition ( 1.2 ) , it is difficult to revert to the operator itself from the operators which have been decomposed @xcite .",
    "further , when we try to establish operator s continuity under wavelet basis , the continuity from @xmath59 to @xmath142 often needs a much stronger weak regularity than from @xmath4 to @xmath4 @xcite . in this section ,",
    "one proves theorem  1.3 through upgrading @xmath1 continuity to @xmath142 continuity .",
    "since the proofs for ( i ) and ( ii ) are similar , one proves only ( i ) .",
