    "recent advances in nanofabrication technology permit to design atom - like structures , such as quantum dots ( qds ) and double quantum dot ( dqds ) , where electron states can be controlled and manipulated.@xcite specifically , the charge states of qds and dqds have been shown to be excellent prototype blocks for the implementation of quantum - computing solid - state devices.@xcite indeed , they are scalable to large system and compatible with current microelectronics technology .    a number of works address the entanglement production , control , and detection in single and double dots nanostructures on the basis of different physical mechanisms.@xcite in all of them the most serious obstacle into generating entanglement and therefore performant quantum circuits is the interaction between the quantum system and its environment , resulting in the system decoherence . for charge qubits in qd and dqd the channels of decoherence are mainly two : the electron - phonon coupling and the electron - electron coulomb interaction.@xcite",
    "the former , stemming from the interaction with the crystal lattice , is widely present in all nanostructures even if its effects can be small at very low temperatures .",
    "the latter is due the coupling of the bound electrons in dq and dqd to other carriers in the system and is therefore extrinsic .    in this work",
    "we analyze the entanglement formation due to two- and three - particle scattering events in qd and dqd structures , respectively . to this aim",
    ", we consider collisions between one or two electrons localized in a single or double dot and another electron entering the structure from a lead , and solve the corresponding schrdinger equation of the two- or three - electron wavefunction in the real - space representation . in our numerical approach",
    "the scattering states are computed with the temperature of the system set equal to zero in order to realistically neglect the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "specifically , we obtain the transmission ( tc ) and reflection coefficient ( rc ) of the electron crossing the nanostructure as a function of its initial kinetic energy and of the orbital state of the bound electron(s).@xcite we stress that the estimation of the amount of quantum correlations is a measure of the loss of coherence undergone by the charge qubits of the dq and dqd when another carrier interacts with them .",
    "we compute the amount of quantum correlations between the scattered and the bound carriers interacting through coulomb repulsion in two different systems , namely a single qd and a double qd , as described in the following .      in this case",
    "we consider a quasi one dimensional structure where a potential profile @xmath0 mimicking a qd is present .",
    "the system is sketched in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "( left panel ) potential profile @xmath1 of the qd structure : the potential well is 110 mev deep and 30 nm wide .",
    "( right panel ) potential profile @xmath2 of the double - dots structure : the two potential wells are each 110 mev deep and 30 nm wide and are separated by a 20 nm long barrier.in both cases the incident electron ( i ) arrives from the left lead while the bound electron(s ) ( b ) initialized in the ( d)qd ground state . ]    the @xmath3 bound states and energies of the qd will be indicated as @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , while @xmath6 describes the transmitted ( reflected ) electron with kinetic energy @xmath7 .",
    "a single electron is localized in the qd ground state @xmath8 and interacts , via coulomb potential , with a second electron incoming from the left lead with kinetic energy @xmath9 .",
    "specifically , we consider only cases in which @xmath9 is not sufficiently high to ionize the qd .",
    "moreover the charging energy of the latter is assumed to be larger than the spacing between the the single - particle energy levels .",
    "this means that our system always operates in the two - particle regime .",
    "the two - particle hamiltonian @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 indicate the dielectric constant and effective mass of the gaas , respectively and @xmath15 is the cut - off term corresponding roughly to the lateral dimension of the confinement@xcite .    the two - particle scattering state @xmath16 is obtained by solving the time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath17 in the square domain @xmath18 $ ] with @xmath19 of eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) .",
    "@xcite to this aim a generalization of the quantum transmitting boundary method@xcite is used .",
    "when the scattered particle leaves the simulation domain , i.e. after the scattering took place , the two - particle wavefunction reads @xmath20 where the coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 represent the reflection and transmission amplitudes in the different energy levels , respectively , and the allowed energies @xmath23 of the scattered electron satisfy the energy conservation @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the number of states for which @xmath26 is positive : for our choice of simulation parameters the contribution of the evanescent modes to the output state is found negligible . here",
    ", all the travelling components of the scattered carrier , both reflected and transmitted , are taken into account in order to evaluate the appearance of quantum correlations and therefore no post - selection process is used , unlike other approaches.@xcite    the calculation of the entanglement between the single - particle states of the qd and the scattered particle can be performed by means of the von neumann entropy @xmath27 of the one - particle reduced density matrix @xmath28 describing the bound electron .",
    "@xcite by tracing the two - particle density matrix @xmath29 over the degrees of freedom @xmath30 of the scattered electron , we obtain @xmath28 which takes a diagonal form .",
    "its elements are given by @xmath31=@xmath32 .",
    "thus the von neumann entropy can be expressed as : @xmath33=-\\sum_{n=0}^m \\left ( |b_n|^2+|c_n|^2\\right ) \\ln{\\left ( |b_n|^2+|c_n|^2\\right)},\\ ] ] and is bound in the interval @xmath34 $ ] , with @xmath27=0 indicating no quantum correlations and @xmath27=@xmath35 indicating the maximum entanglement .      in this subsection",
    "we describe the dqd system with three particles . here , a coulomb scattering between a carrier propagating in a quasi 1d gaas channel with energy @xmath9 and two electrons in a bound state of a potential structure @xmath36 occurs .",
    "the potential @xmath36 consists of two wells separated by a barrier and therefore mimicking a dqd device ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the two - particle bound states of the latter will be indicated as @xmath37 and their energies as @xmath38 . unlike the single qd",
    ", some dqd energy levels can be degenerate . as initial condition",
    ", we take the two electrons in the ground state @xmath39 .",
    "the three - particle hamiltonian @xmath40 reads @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath43 also in this case , gaas material parameters have been used in numerical calculations . by applying the few - particle version of the _ quantum transmitting boundary method _ to solve the schrdinger equation with @xmath40 , we find the reflection and the transmission amplitudes @xmath44 and @xmath45 , in analogy with the previous case , for the three - particle wavefunction : @xmath46 also in this case , the entanglement between the scattered carrier and the dqd system can be evaluated in terms of the von neumann entropy @xmath47 of the reduced density operator @xmath48 describing the two bound electrons . due to the degeneracy of some dqd energy levels , @xmath48 is a diagonal - block matrix with the dimension of each block equal to the degree of degeneracy of the corresponding energy level and thus its diagonalization is required to calculate @xmath47 in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath49 as @xmath50 .",
    "here we present the numerical results and we analyze the relation between resonances in transmission and reflection spectra and the quantum correlations .    in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we report the von neumann entropy @xmath27 as a function of the initial energy of the incoming carrier for the single - dot case , while in the lower panel the modulus of the rcs and tcs .",
    "( top ) von neumann entropy @xmath51 and ( bottom ) modulus of the tcs and rcs of the the channels @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , as a function of the initial energy of the incoming electron @xmath9 ranging from 10 to 40 mev , for the two - particle scattering in the single qd nanostructure.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    at low energy no correlations between the single - particle energy levels are found . in this case",
    "only a single channel is present for transmission and reflection : the incident carrier is scattered elastically ( either transmitted or reflected ) with energy @xmath9 while the qd is left in its ground state @xmath55 .",
    "when the kinetic energy of the incoming carrier reaches a threshold value , around 12.5 mev , a new channel comes into play .",
    "now , as a consequence of the scattering , the dot can also be excited in the first level @xmath56 with the energy of scatterer decreased to @xmath57 . starting from this energy , quantum correlations",
    "are built up between the particles and their peculiar behavior can be related to the resonances appearing in transmission and reflection spectra.@xcite in order to get a better insight into such phenomena , a zoom of the above curves around a resonant energy @xmath9=30 mev is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2bis ] .",
    "( top ) @xmath51 and ( bottom ) modulus of the tcs and rcs of the channels @xmath52 , @xmath53 versus @xmath9 , close to a resonant condition for the two - particle scattering of fig .",
    "[ fig2].,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the entanglement exhibits a maximum ( where @xmath51 is around 0.6 ) , when both the rc and tc of the second channel exhibit a peak .",
    "this means that the excitation probability of the dq due to the collision becomes comparable to the probability of an elastic scattering , and this results in a significative increase in the lack of knowledge about the state of the electron bound in the dot .",
    "also the quantum correlations appearing in the dqd structure , as a consequence of the three - particle scattering event , can be related to the resonances in reflection and transmission spectra , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "( top ) von neumann entropy @xmath47 and ( bottom ) modulus of the tcs and rcs of the channels @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , as a function of the initial energy of the incoming electron @xmath9 ranging from 10 to 40 mev , for the three - particle scattering in the dqd nanostructure.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the maximum value of @xmath47 is reached when the initial energy @xmath9 of the incoming carrier is around 15.8 mev ( see the detail expanded in fig .",
    "[ fig3bis ] ) .",
    "( top ) @xmath47 and ( bottom ) modulus of the tcs and rcs of the channels @xmath52 , @xmath53 versus @xmath9 , close to a resonant condition for the three - particle scattering of fig .",
    "[ fig3].,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    this peak occurs when the sum of the moduli of tc and rc describing the elastic scattering , i.e. when the dqd is left in its ground state @xmath61 with the scattered carrier in the energy level @xmath9 , attains its minimum value while the probability that the scattering occurs through other channels is maximal .",
    "therefore the energy levels of the dqd particles are correlated to the output energies of the scattered electron this meaning that a single pure state can not be ascribed to the dqd system after the scattering .",
    "in this paper we have calculated by means of the von neumann entropy the amount of quantum correlations due to two- and three - electron scatterings in qd and dqd nanostructures , respectively .",
    "the outcomes of the numerical simulations show that the quantum entanglement between the scattered carrier and the particle(s ) bound in the single or double dot systems is strictly related to the behavior of the tc and rc of the various scattering channels.@xcite specifically , when the scattering occurs through various channels with comparable probabilities , the uncertainty about the specific energy states of the electrons bound in qd and dqd is increased due to the greater amount of entanglement with the scattered particle .",
    "our results agree with previous works@xcite where the entanglement formation due to the scattering events in single qds is shown to be related to the different nature of the resonances present only in the transmission spectra of the injected carrier . there",
    "the entanglement is an estimation of the correlations showed up once the crossing through the qd is successfully detected . on the other hand , in this work all the travelling components , either reflected or transmitted , of the scattered electron",
    "have been taken into account , that is no post - selection process has been considered .",
    "thus our investigation can be viewed as the first step towards a rigorous analysis of the decoherence due to successive scatterings of a number of injected carriers , and therefore of an electric current .",
