    "fermat determined the optimal value by imposing a condition using his _ adequality _ of quantities .",

    "newton had explicitly written that his _ ultimate ratios _ were not actually ratios but , rather , _ limits _ of prime ratios ( see russell 1903 ( * ? ? ?",

    "benacerraf ( 1965 @xcite ) formulated a related dichotomy in terms of mathematical practice _ vs _ mathematical ontology .",
    "for example , the leibnizian laws of continuity ( see knobloch 2002 @xcite ) and homogeneity can be recast in terms of modern concepts such as the _ transfer principle _ and the _ standard part principle _ over the hyperreals , without ever appealing to the semantic content of the technical development of the hyperreals as a _ punctiform _ continuum ; similarly , leibniz s proof of the product rule for differentiation is essentially identical , at the syntactic level , to a modern infinitesimal proof ( see section  [ lei ] ) .",
    "the crucial distinction between syntactic and semantic aspects of the work involving mathematical continua appears to have been overlooked by r.  arthur who finds fault with the hyperreal proxy of the leibnizian continuum , by arguing that the latter was _ non - punctiform _ ( see arthur 2013 @xcite ) .",

    "the caliber of some of the response to robinson s challenge has been disappointing .",

    "similarly problematic is easwaran s assumption that an infinite sequence of probabilistic tests must necessarily be modeled by the set of standard natural numbers ( this is discussed in more detail in subsection  [ will ] ) .",
    "such an assumption eliminates the possibility of modeling it by a sequence of infinite hypernatural length .",
    "indeed , once one allows for infinite sequences to be modeled in this way , the problem of assigning a probability to an infinite sequence of coin tosses that was studied in ( elga 2004 @xcite ) and ( williamson 2007 @xcite ) allows for an elegant hyperreal solution ( herzberg 2007 @xcite ) .    easwaran reiterates the common objection that the hyperreals are allegedly `` non - constructive '' entities .",
    "the bitter roots of such an allegation in the radical constructivist views of e. bishop have been critically analyzed in ( katz & katz 2011 @xcite ) , and contrasted with the liberal views of the intuitionist a.  heyting , who felt that robinson s theory was `` a standard model of important mathematical research '' ( heyting 1973 @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that bishop s target was _ classical mathematics _ ( as a whole ) , the demise of which he predicted in the following terms :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ very possibly classical mathematics will cease to exist as an independent discipline ( bishop 1968 @xcite ) .",

    "namely , he assumes that    1 .",
    "a vast number of independent tests is best modeled by a temporal arrangement thereof , rather than by a simultaneous collection ; and 2 .",
    "the collection of seconds ticking away  from now [ and ] into the future \" gives a faithful representation of the natural numbers .",
    "these two premises are not self - evident and some research mathematicians have very different intuitions about the matter , as much of the literature on applied nonstandard analysis ( e.g. , albeverio et al .  1986 @xcite ; reder 2003 @xcite ) illustrates .",
    "it seems that in easwaran s model , an agent can choose not to flip the coin at some seconds , thus giving rise to events like  a coin that is flipped starting at second 2 comes up heads on every flip \" .",
    "however , in all applications we are aware of , this additional structure used to rule out the use of hyperreals as range of probability functions seems not to be relevant .",
    "williamson and easwaran appear to be unwilling to assume that , once one decides to use hyperreal infinitesimals , one should also replace the original algebra  of propositions in which the agent has credences \" with an internal algebra of the hyperreal setting .",
    "in fact , such an additional step allows one to avoid both the problems raised by williamson s argument in his formulation using conditional probability , and those raised by easwaran in section 8.2 of his paper .",
    "a possible model with hyperreal infinitesimals for an infinite sequence of coin tosses is given by representing every event by means of a sequence  @xmath38 , where  @xmath39 represents the outcome of the  @xmath40th flip and  @xmath41 is a fixed hypernatural number . in this model , consider the events `` @xmath42 heads for  @xmath43 '' , that we will denote  @xmath44 , and `` @xmath42 heads for  @xmath45 '' , that we will denote  @xmath46 .",
    "in such a setting , events  @xmath44 and @xmath46 are not isomorphic , contrary to what was argued in ( williamson @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that hypernatural numbers are an elementary extension of the natural numbers , for which the formula  @xmath47 always holds .",
    "moreover , the probability of @xmath44 is the infinitesimal  @xmath48 , while the probability of  @xmath46 is the strictly greater infinitesimal  @xmath49 , thus obeying the well known rule for conditional probability .",
    "easwaran s section 8.4 entitled  the complexity argument \" is based on four premises .",
    "however , his premise 3 , to the effect that  all physical quantities can be entirely parametrized using the standard real numbers \" , is unlikely to lead to meaningful philosophical conclusions based on `` first principles '' .",

    "the assumption of the global axiom of choice is a strong foundational assumption .",
    "the construction of the surreal numbers can be performed within a version of nbg that is a conservative extension of zfc , but does not need limitation of size ( or global choice ) . however , nbg clearly is not a conservative extension of zf ; and if one wishes to prove certain interesting features of the surreals one needs an even stronger version of nbg that involves the axiom of global choice .",
    "therefore , the axiomatic foundation that one needs for using the surreal numbers is at least as strong as the one needed for the hyperreals .      at the previous turn of the century , h.  heaton wrote :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ i think i know exactly what is meant by the term zero .",

    "heaton points out several mathematical inconsistencies or ill - chosen terminology among the conceptions of infinitesimals of his contemporaries .",
    "this highlights the brilliant mathematical achievement of a consistent `` calculus '' for infinitesimals attained through the work of hewitt ( 1948 @xcite ) , o ( 1955 @xcite ) , robinson ( 1961 @xcite ) , and nelson ( 1977 @xcite ) , but also of their predecessors like fermat , euler , leibniz , and cauchy , as we analyze respectively in sections  [ fermat ] , [ lei ] , [ euler ] , and  [ cauchy ] .",
    "our interpretation of fermat s technique is compatible with those by strmholm ( 1968 @xcite ) and giusti ( 2009 @xcite ) .",
    "it is at variance with the interpretation by breger ( 1994 @xcite ) , considered by knobloch ( 2014 @xcite ) to have been refuted .",
    "adequality , or  @xmath50 ( parisots ) in the original greek of diophantus , is a crucial step in fermat s method of finding maxima , minima , tangents , and solving other problems that a modern mathematician would solve using infinitesimal calculus .",
    "the method is presented in a series of short articles in fermat s collected works .",
    "the first article , _ methodus ad disquirendam maximam et minimam _",
    ", opens with a summary of an algorithm for finding the maximum or minimum value of an algebraic expression in a variable  @xmath34 . for convenience",
    ", we will write such an expression in modern functional notation as  @xmath51 .",
    "one version of the algorithm can be broken up into six steps in the following way :    1 .",
    "introduce an auxiliary symbol  @xmath52 , and form  @xmath53 ; 2 .",
    "set _ adequal _ the two expressions  @xmath54 ( the notation `` @xmath55 '' for adequality is ours , not fermat s ) ; 3 .",

    "the remaining terms all contain a factor of  @xmath52 ; 4 .",
    "[ divide ] divide by  @xmath52 ( see also next step ) ; 5 .",
    "[ higher ] in a parenthetical comment , fermat adds :  or by the highest common factor of  @xmath52 \" ; 6 .   [ among ] among the remaining terms , suppress all terms which still contain a factor of  @xmath52 . solving the resulting equation for  @xmath56 yields the extremum of  @xmath57 .    in modern mathematical language , the algorithm entails expanding the difference quotient @xmath58 in powers of  @xmath52 and taking the constant term . as in step  . ]",
    "the method ( leaving aside step  ) is immediately understandable to a modern reader as the elementary calculus exercise of finding the extremum by solving the equation  @xmath59 .",
    "but the real question is how fermat understood this algorithm in his own terms , in the mathematical language of his time , prior to the invention of calculus by barrow , leibniz , newton , and others .",
    "there are two crucial points in trying to understand fermat s reasoning : first , the meaning of `` adequality '' in step ( 2 ) , and second , the justification for suppressing the terms involving positive powers of  @xmath52 in step  .",
    "the two issues are closely related because interpretation of adequality depends on the conditions on  @xmath52 .",
    "one condition which fermat always assumes is that  @xmath52 is positive .",
    "he did not use negative numbers in his calculations .",
    ", he only considers a ray ( rather than a full line ) starting at a point of the curve .",
    "the convexity of the curve implies an inequality , which fermat transforms into an _",
    "adequality _ without giving much explanation of his procedure , but assuming implicitly that the ray is tangent to the curve .",
    "but a transverse ray would satisfy the inequality no less than a tangent ray , indicating that fermat is relying on an additional piece of geometric information .",
    "his procedure of applying the defining relation of the curve itself , to a point on the tangent ray , is only meaningful when the increment  @xmath52 is small ( see subsection  [ four ] ) . ]",
    "fermat introduces the term _ adequality _ in _ methodus _ with a reference to diophantus of alexandria . in the third article of the series , _ ad eamdem methodum _ ( _ sur la mme mthode _ ) , he quotes diophantus greek term  @xmath50 , which he renders following xylander and bachet , as _ adaequatio _ or _ adaequalitas _",
    "( see a.  weil @xcite ) .",
    "consider fermat s calculation of the tangent line to the parabola ( see fermat @xcite ) . to simplify fermat s notation",
    ", we will work with the parabola  @xmath60 , or @xmath61 to understand what fermat is doing , it is helpful to think of the parabola as a level curve of the two - variable function  @xmath62 .    given a point  @xmath63 on the parabola , fermat wishes to find the tangent line through the point .",
    "fermat exploits the geometric fact that by convexity , a point @xmath64 on the tangent line lies _ outside _ the parabola .",
    "he therefore obtains an inequality equivalent in our notation to  @xmath65 , or  @xmath66 . here",
    "@xmath67 , and  @xmath52 is fermat s magic symbol we wish to understand .",

    "* section  24 ) ) as well as fermat himself , as his correspondence with wallis makes clear ; see katz , schaps & shnider ( 2013 ( * ? ? ? * section  2.1 ) ) .",

    "thus , as for finite sets , there exists a permutation  @xmath120 of the hyperfinite grid @xmath151 by decreasing value of  @xmath152 ( here  @xmath153 is the maximal value ) .",
    "we assume that equal values are ordered lexicographically so that  @xmath154 .",

    "the hyperreal approach makes it possible to solve konyagin s problem without resorting to standard treatments of decreasing rearrangements which use measure theory .",

    "this illustrates one of the advantages of the hyperreal approach .",
    "we have critically reviewed several common misrepresentations of hyperreal number systems , not least in relation to their alleged non - constructiveness , from a historical , philosophical , and set - theoretic perspective .",
    "in particular we have countered some of easwaran s recent arguments against the use of hyperreals in formal epistemology .",
    "a hyperreal framework enables a richer syntax better suited for expressing proxies for procedural moves found in the work of fermat , leibniz , euler , and cauchy .",
