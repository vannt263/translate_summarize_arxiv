    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce and analyze two exactly solvable discrete time versions of @xmath0-tasep . before introducing them we recall the continuous time poisson @xmath0-tasep which was previously studied in @xcite .",
    "let us fix some notation used throughout . for @xmath2",
    "we denote the state of @xmath0-tasep with @xmath3 particles as @xmath4 , where we have fixed a virtual particle at infinity by setting @xmath5 .",
    "the gap between particle @xmath6 and @xmath7 is denoted @xmath8 .",
    "we define and provide some background for the continuous time poisson @xmath0-tasep .",
    "all of the results of this paper will be stated simultaneously for this process as well as its two discrete time variants .",
    "the @xmath3-particle continuous time poisson @xmath0-tasep with particle rate parameters @xmath9 is an interacting particle system @xmath10 in which for each @xmath11 , @xmath12 moves to @xmath13 at exponential rate @xmath14 ( which vanishes when @xmath15 ) , where @xmath0 is a parameter in @xmath16 .",
    "here we assume that these exponentially distributed jumping events are all independent , and we note that since they occur in continuous time , no two jumps occur simultaneously , almost surely . also note that the evolution of @xmath17 only depends on those particles with lower indices than @xmath6 .",
    "step initial condition is defined as setting @xmath18 for @xmath11 .",
    "[ zerorem ] the continuous time poisson @xmath0-tasep and the recognition of its exact solvability comes from the work of @xcite on macdonald processes .",
    "it was soon after studied in its own right in @xcite via the type of many body system approach methods which we develop herein for the two discrete time variants of the process .",
    "recently @xcite showed how @xmath0-tasep arises from considerations involving a @xmath0-deformed generalization of the dual rsk correspondence and @xcite showed how it arises from a certain class of nearest - neighbor stochastic dynamics on gelfand - tsetlin patterns .",
    "it would be very interesting to extend those works or the method of @xcite to include the ( more general ) discrete time @xmath0-taseps of the present paper as well .",
    "the evolution of @xmath19 for @xmath11 ( for the continuous time poisson @xmath0-tasep ) is given by a totally asymmetric zero range process with site dependent jump rate @xmath20 and infinite sink and source at the boundary .",
    "a variant of this zero range process can be seen as corresponding to a particular representation of the @xmath0-boson hamiltonian considered in @xcite . in @xcite , integrability ( in the form of @xmath21 and @xmath22 matrices satisfying yang - baxter relations ) for this @xmath0-boson hamiltonian was shown , though the connection of that to the exact solvability of @xmath0-tasep discussed below remains to be understood . a stationary ( infinite lattice )",
    "variant of the above gap zero range process was also discussed immediately after theorem 2.9 of @xcite and an @xmath23 upper and lower bound on the variance of the stationary current is established therein .",
    "poisson @xmath0-tasep has an interpretation as a model for traffic on a one - lane ( discrete ) road @xmath24 in which the rate at which cars jump forward is modulated by the distance to the next car ( as well as a car dependent rate parameter @xmath25 ) . as",
    "the distance goes to zero , the jump rate goes to zero , and as the distance grows , the jump rate approaches @xmath25 .",
    "step initial condition corresponds to an initially jammed configuration .    when @xmath26 , continuous time poisson @xmath0-tasep becomes the well - studied model of continuous time tasep ( and likewise the discrete time versions of @xmath0-tasep we introduce become known discrete time version of tasep ) .",
    "the configuration of particles in tasep for a fixed time @xmath27 can be described as a determinantal point process in which all correlation functions are given by minors of a single correlation kernel ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) . in other terminology , tasep is free - fermion , or related to schur processes , or non - interacting line ensembles .",
    "given that structure there exists a clean path to fredholm determinant formulas for marginal distributions , which in turn allow readily for asymptotic analysis ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    the present work , where @xmath28 , does not appear to be determinantal , hence new ideas are necessary to study and extract asymptotic distributional information about the processes considered . in recent years there has been a flurry of activity surrounding the analysis of non - determinantal yet still exactly solvable stochastic interacting particle systems @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was explained how , instead of the determinantal structure of correlation functions , these non - determinantal systems are exactly solvable due to the existence of concise and exact formulas for expectations of large classes of observables of the particle systems ( in fact , in many cases large enough classes to uniquely characterize the fixed time distribution of the particle systems ) .",
    "a natural question about @xmath0-tasep is to compute the distribution of @xmath29 ( which is the location of particle @xmath30 at time @xmath27 ) .",
    "there are ( presently ) two approaches to compute this distribution .",
    "the first is through the theory of macdonald processes @xcite , and the second is through the many body system ( or duality ) approach @xcite .    the first approach is entirely based on the integrable properties of macdonald polynomials ( see section [ macsec ] for a brief review on the relationship of the two approaches ) , and these properties naturally lead to the discovery of @xmath0-tasep as well as the computation of nested contour integral formulas for expectations of certain observables of the process .",
    "in particular , for step initial condition this shows that ( see also @xcite or theorem [ momthm ] below ) for @xmath31 , @xmath32= \\frac{(-1)^k q^{k(k-1)/2}}{(2\\pi \\iota)^k } \\int \\cdots \\int \\prod_{1\\leq a < b\\leq k } \\frac{z_a - z_b}{z_a - qz_b } \\prod_{j=1}^{k } \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{n_j } \\frac{a_i}{a_i - z_j}\\right ) e^{(q-1)tz_j } \\frac{dz_j}{z_j},\\ ] ] where the contour of integration for @xmath33 contains @xmath34 as well as @xmath35 , but not zero ( see figure [ circontours ] for an example of such a contour when all @xmath36 ) . the above formula is given in theorem [ momthm ] along with parallel formulas for the discrete time versions .    since the observables @xmath37 are all in @xmath16 , their moment problem is well - posed .",
    "this means that the above formulas uniquely characterize the joint distribution of @xmath0-tasep at time @xmath27 ( provided it is started from step initial condition at time zero ) .",
    "it remains a challenge to extract manageable ( from the perspective of large @xmath27 and @xmath30 asymptotics ) formulas for joint distributions , though it is understood how to derive a fredholm determinant formula which characterizes the one - point distribution of @xmath29 .",
    "this is described in theorem [ distthm ] .",
    "the second approach to solving the continuous time poisson @xmath0-tasep is based solely on the observation that the dynamics of the particle system implies that the expectations on the left - hand side of ( [ exp1 ] ) satisfy certain closed systems of coupled odes , which we call _ many body systems_. these systems have unique solutions and it is easy to check that the nested contour integral formulas on the right - hand side of ( [ exp1 ] ) satisfy these systems ( and hence are equal to the expectations on the left - hand side of ( [ exp1 ] ) ) .",
    "this second approach is more direct ( it avoids explicit mention of macdonald polynomials ) and appears to be more general ( it applies to asep @xcite , which is not known to fit into the theory of macdonald processes ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it requires non - trivial input of a suitable interacting particle system , the correct observables to study and some inspiration in guessing a closed form solution to the associated many body system . for all of the versions of @xmath0-tasep",
    "the fact that these expectations satisfy the many body system can be seen immediately from the macdonald process perspective as a consequence of certain commutation relations involving macdonald difference operators ( see section [ macsec ] ) .",
    "it is this second approach which we employ in this paper to study the two exactly solvable discrete time @xmath0-taseps we now introduce .",
    "before we proceed , let us fix some additional notation .",
    "we use @xmath38 to denote particle rate parameters , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 to denote ( discrete ) time dependent jump parameters .",
    "the indicator function of an event @xmath41 is written @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath0-pochhammer symbol is defined as @xmath43 finally , we define a variant of the weyl chamber as @xmath44      the two discrete time versions of @xmath0-tasep which we introduce and study were not fabricated out of thin air , but rather came from further investigations into dynamics related to macdonald processes which may be detailed in a future work ( cf .",
    "@xcite for some related developments ) .",
    "all three versions of @xmath0-tasep are illustrated in figure [ qtaseps ] .",

    "we will make use of the following @xmath0-deformation of the truncated geometric distribution .",
    "for @xmath45 and @xmath46 the distribution @xmath47 is defined as @xmath48 for @xmath49 we extend the definition so that @xmath50    [ sumone ] for @xmath51 and @xmath46 , @xmath52 for all @xmath53 and @xmath54    the positivity is immediate as @xmath55 .",
    "that these @xmath47 sum to one can be seen inductively ( in @xmath56 ) by using the recursion ( see ( 10.0.3 ) in @xcite ) for the @xmath0-binomial coefficients ( which occur in the definition of @xmath47 as the fraction ) .",

    "we call these systems _ true evolution equations_. 2 .",
    "the true evolution equations are almost constant coefficient or separable , except for effects which arise when some of the @xmath104 are close together . rather than trying to solve the true evolution equation directly",
    ", one can look for solutions to the free evolution equation ( i.e. , the constant coefficient and separable system neglecting the boundary effects ) on the larger space @xmath105 which have the right initial data when restricted to @xmath106 and which satisfy certain boundary conditions when some of the @xmath104 are all equal .",
    "the restriction of such a solution to @xmath106 will coincide with the solution to the true evolution equation . generally , for every possible combination of clusters of @xmath107 (",

    "it turns out that for the three versions of @xmath0-tasep we consider , it suffices to consider only @xmath1 two - body boundary conditions ( which ends up being the same for all three systems ) corresponding to when @xmath108 .",

    "this type of reduction goes back to the 1931 work of on diagonalizing the heisenberg spin chain @xcite .",
    "our reduction , under the scaling limit to the continuum stochastic heat equation mentioned above , cincides with that for the quantum delta bose gas ( also known as the lieb - liniger model @xcite ) .",
    "3 .   a general class of solutions to the free evolution equation exists since it is separable and constant coefficient .",
    "it is not immediately clear how to combine solutions from this class so as to additionally satisfy the @xmath1 two - body boundary conditions and the initial data .",
    "however , for the initial data corresponding to step initial condition , it is also possible to ( easily ) check that _ nested contour integral formulas _",
    "( such as in ( [ exp1 ] ) ) solve the free evolution equation and satisfy the @xmath1 two - body boundary conditions .",
