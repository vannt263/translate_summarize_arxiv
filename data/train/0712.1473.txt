    "recent studies using moderately large samples of nearby disk galaxies have demonstrated that `` exponential '' disks actually fall into three categories of surface - brightness profiles @xcite . for a more detailed discussion of the background and context , we direct the reader to those papers and to the contribution by pohlen et al .",
    "( this volume ) . here , we briefly discuss some preliminary results relating disk profiles to general galaxy properties , including hubble type and degree of barredness , as well as evidence for environmental dependence .",
    "the left panel of figure  1 shows the frequency of different profile types along the hubble sequence , using the galaxies from @xcite , @xcite , and gutirrez et al .",
    "( 2008 , in prep ) . for simplicity , we group the profiles into `` truncations '' ( type ii , including both `` classical '' truncations [ ct ] and outer - lindblad - resonance [ olr ] breaks ) and `` non - truncations '' ( types i and iii ) .",
    "it is clear that truncations of various types are most common in the _ latest _ hubble types .",
    "this is consistent with the reported high frequency of truncations from studies of edge - on disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since these studies have concentrated on late - type spirals ( principally sc ",
    "the right panel of figure  1 shows the distribution of profiles types as a function of bar strength , using the standard rc3 classifications , for early - type disks ( s0sb ) in the field .",
    "the frequency of type ii profiles is clearly higher in barred galaxies ; most of this is probably related to the outer lindblad resonance of the bars @xcite .",
    "we can also see that the frequency of type iii profiles is _ anti_-correlated with bars ( a trend also present if we use numerical measures of bar strength ) .",
    "this suggests that whatever process produces antitruncations also weakens and destroys bars , or else that bar formation tends to suppress this process ; in either case , this places useful constraints on scenarios of disk profile formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we are currently investigating whether outer disk profiles are affected by their environment .",
    "preliminary results point to a dramatic difference in disk profiles between the virgo cluster and the local field environment ( including galaxies in groups ) , at least for barred s0sb galaxies : about half the field galaxies have type ii profiles , but only 10% of the virgo galaxies do .",
    "this suggests a strong role for the cluster environment in modifying outer disk formation , something of potential relevance for , e.g. , models of s0 formation .",
