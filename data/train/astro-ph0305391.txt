    "discovery of the first x - ray burster was reported by grindlay et al .",
    "( 1976)@xcite and by belian et al .",
    "( 1976)@xcite .",
    "we believe that these objects are low mass binary stars which contain the accreting neutron star .",
    "since we do not observe x - ray pulsations , the magnetic field of the neutron star is lower than @xmath3 gs . weak magnetic field of such intensity allows for the existence of accretion disc .",
    "basic features of x - ray burst are : fast rise @xmath4 1 s and decay time @xmath4 3  100 s , luminosity near the peak about @xmath5 erg / s and energy per burst @xmath6 ergs ( cf . review article by joss & rappaport 1984@xcite ) .",
    "the idea that energy source of a burst is the thermonuclear flash was proposed by woosley and taam ( 1976)@xcite and maraschi & cavaliere ( 1977)@xcite .",
    "this model quite well explains many global features of x - ray bursters .",
    "initially neutron star spectra were assumed to be blackbody spectra , but this assumption is not valid when the atmosphere was dominated by scattering on free electrons . in such case spectra of outgoing photons",
    "are shifted towards higher energy and the maximum is shifted in the same direction both for the coherent thomson , and noncoherent compton scattering . in electron scattering stellar atmosphere , photons are created by thermal processes below the photosphere , in so called thermalization layer . in this layer local temperature t is much higher than the effective temperature @xmath1 , therefore maximum of the planck function @xmath7 occurs in higher energy than the maximum of @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , the blackbody temperature @xmath9 as obtained from fitting of continuum spectra , can be much larger than the true @xmath1 .",
    "temperature @xmath9 is usually referred to as the color temperature @xmath0 .    in principle",
    ", the ratio @xmath10 can reach arbitrary large values in thomson scattering stellar atmospheres , provided that true absorption in that atmospheres decreases to zero ( madej 1974 @xcite ) .",
    "compton scattering in stellar atmospheres reduces @xmath10 by unknown factor , but still this ratio remains larger than unity .",
    "model atmosphere computations with account of compton scattering , and exact @xmath10 determination , are very difficult .",
    "ebisuzaki , hanawa & sugimoto ( 1984)@xcite estimated @xmath11 by use the simple opacity formulae .",
    "model atmospheres computations by london , taam & howard ( 1986)@xcite showed , that this ratio was in the range from 1.2 to 1.7 and depended on few parameters : @xmath1 , surface gravity log g and iron abundance .",
    "london , taam & howard ( 1986 ) @xcite concluded that the solar iron abundance does not influence significantly the ratio @xmath10 . on the other hand , ebisuzaki & nomoto ( 1986)@xcite claimed that absorption by iron decrease this ratio",
    "our model equations describe transfer of radiation subject to constraints of hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium .",
    "we assume the equation of state of ideal gas in local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "the equation of transfer includes f - f absorption from all ions , b - f absorption from iron ions , and compton scattering terms .",
    "the equation of transfer is as follows : @xmath12 where : @xmath13 is the planck function , @xmath14 the mean intensity , @xmath15 is the ratio of true absorption to coefficient of total opacity , @xmath16 the monochromatic optical depth , and @xmath17 denotes cosine of zenithal angle .",
    "+ details of the above equation of transfer , and compton scattering redistribution functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and linearization procedure , are described in earlier papers ( see madej 1991 @xcite ; madej & raska 2000a@xcite , b@xcite ; madej , joss & raska 2003@xcite ) .",
    "we calculated our models with the following assumptions : equation of state in lte , hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium , plane - parallel geometry , non rotating star .",
    "our equations allow for large photon - electron energy exchange at the time of compton scattering .",
    "details of the computer code and linearization scheme were extensively described in earlier papers quoted in previous section .",
    "we calculated grid of models each of them computed on the 144 standard optical depth points ( 12 points per the decade ) from @xmath20 to @xmath21 and 901 wavelength points .",
    "we computed few models of hot neutron star atmospheres with effective temperatures @xmath1=1 , 2 , 3@xmath22 k , and surface gravities @xmath23 from the critical gravity up to @xmath24 in cgs units .",
    "models assume h and he in solar number abundance @xmath25 and iron with number abundance @xmath26 ( approximately solar value ) and 100 times greater .",
    "we claim that our computations can measure both the ratio @xmath2 and its slight changes influenced by small differences of @xmath1 , @xmath27 and iron abundance .",
    "we obtain models of burster atmospheres where the constancy of the bolometric flux is almost everywhere better than 1% , and only in few optical depth points approches 2% .",
    "tables 1 and 2 show values of @xmath2 computed over wide range of parameters @xmath1 , @xmath27 and iron abundance .",
    "we can see that for models with pure h - he atmospheres , these ratios are higher than for atmospheres with nonzero iron abundance , of course for the same @xmath1 and @xmath27 . for higher metal abundance these ratios decrease .",
    "this is because increase of metal abundance diminish the importance of compton scattering , and @xmath2 ratio is than determined by the redistribution of outgoing flux by nongray metal absorption",
    ".    what is interesting , for the lowest @xmath28k these ratios exhibit local mimimum in some intermediate @xmath27 .",
    "tendencies , which we observe are due to iron opacity and the compton scattering . for the lowest surface gravity compton scattering",
    "dominates over thermal absorption , therefore shift of the peak spectra is the highest . in the presence of iron , thermal absorption is greater than in case of h - he atmospheres .",
    "consequently , the @xmath2 is lower for atmospheres containing iron .    in figure 1",
    "we show the outgoing photon spectra for various parameters .",
    "we compare blackbody spectra with the spectra of h - he atmosphere and with the atmosphere containing iron in figure 1a .",
    "we can see that the blackbody spectra ( solid line ) have the peak in lower energy and the bb spectrum is softer than the spectrum of the model x - ray burster . in lower photon energies we obtain excess of the outgoing flux as compared to the blackbody spectra both for h - he models and atmospheres containing some amount of iron .",
    "figures 1c and 1d present spectra of atmospheres with iron abundance 100 times greater than the solar abundance , and with the solar iron abundance , respectively .",
    "for the latter iron abundance we note , that the iron ionisation edge appear in emission for two lowest @xmath1 .",
    "profiles of iron absorption lines ( fundamental series of h - like , and he - like ions ) can be very complicated ( see fig .",
    "1b ) . in some models",
    "we obtain inverse emission in iron line cores , which strictly correspond to temperature inversion reproduced in our model atmospheres with compton scattering .",
    "we stress here , that we did not obtain values of @xmath2 larger than 2.0 in any of our model atmospheres of x - ray burst sources .",
