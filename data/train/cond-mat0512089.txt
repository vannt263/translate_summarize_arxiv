    "one of the most surprising results of sequencing the human genome is the small number of genes found : we have only about 25 000 genes , compared to , _",
    "e.g. _ , the about 19 000 genes of the simple worm _ c. elegans _ @xcite .",
    "this implies that the higher complexity of the human organism can not be understood in terms of the number of genes .",
    "in addition , all different cell tissues ",
    "humans have more than 200  carry the full genetic information , but the corresponding gene expression patterns , _",
    "i.e. _ the set of genes which are actually transcribed into mrna and translated into proteins , are very different from one tissue to another . in this sense",
    ", different cell types can be understood as different robust _ expression states _ of the full genetic information .",
    "simple mono - cellular organisms , in contrast , have generally only one expression state .",
    "the key process hereby is _",
    "gene regulation_. the transcription of a gene into mrna is realised by a rna polymerase .",
    "the action of this molecular machine is enhanced or suppressed by the presence of transcription factors ( tf ) binding to the dna region upstream of the gene .",
    "tfs are themselves proteins , encoded in other genes .",
    "this defines a ( directed ) regulatory interaction from the gene coding for the tf to the regulated gene . only if the first one is expressed , the tf is present in the cell , and can thus up- or down - regulate the gene expression .",
    "the set of all regulatory interactions is called the _ gene - regulatory network _ ( grn ) .        in the last two decades a large wealth of new data about the genome - wide organisation of gene - regulatory networks has been and is still being collected @xcite .",
    "it has become clear that in many cases biological functions can not be identified at the level of single or few genes and proteins .",
    "constructing a detailed biochemical model of an entire cell by analysing each gene and the nature of its interactions with others one by one appears , however , to be an intractable task . even in the case of a relatively simple cell like yeast ,",
    "the number of genes is slightly above 6000 . in order to make progress in the understanding of the combinatorial aspects of gene regulation , it is thus crucial to model these systems on a _ coarse - grained level _ @xcite .",
    "genetic interactions have to be encoded in a discrete grn : nodes of this network represent individual genes , and directed connections their regulatory interactions .",
    "such models are expected to give valuable insight into the collective large - scale behaviour of the gene regulatory mechanism , and - through the understanding of these discrete models - it seems to be possible to infer and study emergent cooperative phenomena in real biological systems which can not be understood at the level of single genes @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of these model allows further on efficient _ in silico _ experiments which may serve as a valuable input to the design of real experiments .",
    "statistical physics provides important tools for the analysis of such complex systems , and in turn finds in them new technical challenges .    in order to approach this problem",
    ", we need to choose a class of discrete models which on one hand is detailed enough to schematically encode the underlying biological processes , but on the other hand is simple enough to allow for a large - scale quantitative analysis .",
    "we therefore decided to restrict the present work to _ boolean networks _ ( bn ) which compress the full information about the transcription of a gene into a binary variable .",
    "this choice allows for a pretty complete characterisation of the topological and functional properties we are going to analyse below .",
    "note however , that all applied methods can be simply generalised to more detailed descriptions , as long as the discrete nature of modelling is retained .",
    "bn are dynamical models originally introduced by s. kauffman in the late 60s @xcite . since kauffman s seminal work ,",
    "bn have been used as abstract modelling schemes in many different fields , including cell differentiation , immune response , evolution , and gene - regulatory networks ( for an introductory review see @xcite and references therein ) . in recent days , bn have received a renewed attention as a powerful scheme of data analysis , and modelling of high - throughput genomics and proteomics experiments @xcite .    the bottom - line of previous research is the description and classification of different attractor types being present in bn under deterministic parallel update dynamics @xcite .",
    "special attention was dedicated to so - called critical bn @xcite situated at the transition between ordered and chaotic dynamics .",
    "we follow here a complementary approach : our main goal is to study the statistical properties of _ fixed points _ of general bn , by recasting the original dynamical problem into a _ constraint satisfaction problem _ , and then using different techniques borrowed from statistical mechanics of disordered systems @xcite .",
    "a parallel approach was used in @xcite , and some of the results are already discussed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised in the following way . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the model focusing on kauffman models with @xmath0 inputs per boolean function . in sec",
    "[ sec : cc ] we introduce the notion of the _ computational core _ , and investigate two different percolation phenomena related to it . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cavity ]",
    "we apply the cavity method and introduce different message passing algorithms that allow to characterise in detail number and organisation of fixed points . in sec .",
    "[ sec : k34 ] we extend the picture to the cases @xmath1 and present a conjecture for the general @xmath2 case . in sec .",
    "[ sec : appl ] we test our approach in two specific biological examples : the grn of yeast ( _ saccaromices cerevisi _ ) and a subnetwork of the fruit - fly _",
    "drosophila melanogaster_. sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] is devoted to conclusions of the present work and to an outlook on various open question .",
    "in the simplest and most coarse - grained setting , the expression level of one gene can be modelled by a boolean variable : the gene - expression level @xmath3 of gene @xmath4 can be either @xmath5 ( gene @xmath4 is not expressed ) or @xmath6 ( gene @xmath4 is expressed ) @xcite .",
    "although gene - expression levels ( given by mrna and protein concentrations ) are certainly not boolean variables , it turns out that a boolean level of description is able to capture many essential features of gene regulation and moreover can cope with the often only qualitative nature of biological knowledge @xcite .",
    "this simplified view has become more adequate since the recent progress of biotechnology has made fundamental biological mechanisms experimentally accessible at a _ genome - wide scale_. an example are gene - expression experiments , where the activity of a large number of genes is examined at the same time , using dna - chip techniques whose output needs to be digitalised before further processing in a boolean framework .",
    "having @xmath7 genes ( symbolised by circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) , the global expression pattern can be described in terms of a @xmath7-dimensional boolean vector @xmath8 . in this framework",
    ", gene - regulatory constraints are modelled as boolean functions ( the squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) : the expression level @xmath9 of gene @xmath10 is determined by a set of @xmath11 expression levels @xmath12 of the transcription factors @xmath13 : @xmath14 with @xmath15 running over all regulated genes ( see @xcite for a an interesting study on the different strategies nature may adopt in order to implement boolean regulatory rules ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , not all variables need to be controlled by a boolean function , i.e.  in general we have @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "note also that the actual value of the number @xmath11 of inputs to @xmath18 may depend on @xmath10 , even if the major part of this work will concentrate on the case of constant @xmath11 for reasons of clarity .",
    "is an example for an external input variable , @xmath19 for a functional variable , whereas @xmath20 stands for a transcription factor . ]",
    "the whole set of @xmath21 boolean constraints together with the @xmath7 variables define completely the network .",
    "the aim of this work is to introduce new methods borrowed from statistical mechanics of disordered systems .",
    "these methods are able to enumerate and classify the @xmath22 fixed points , _ i.e. _  the set of all vectors @xmath23 fulfilling simultaneously _ all _ the @xmath24 boolean constraints of type eq .",
    "( [ eq : function ] ) . with this aim",
    "we introduce an hamiltonian counting twice the number of not satisfied boolean constraints : @xmath25 the symbol @xmath26 stands for the logical xor operation , _",
    "i.e. _  each cost term contributes @xmath5 to the sum iff eq .",
    "( [ eq : function ] ) is fulfilled , and @xmath27 otherwise .",
    "the prefactor two is introduced for later convenience , and the notation @xmath28 is simply an abbreviation which will be useful later on .",
    "the @xmath29 fixed points equal consequently the ground states of hamiltonian ( [ eq : function ] ) , provided that the minimum energy is zero , _",
    "i.e. _ that all constraints are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "this embeds the problem of finding fixed points into the class of _ constraint - satisfaction problems _ , which have been recently studied extensively from the point of view of statistical physics , using various techniques from spin - glass physics , in particular the replica and cavity methods @xcite , but also percolation - type arguments .    in this work ,",
    "we concentrate our attention to _ random factor graphs _ subjected to two conditions :    * function nodes @xmath18 have fixed in - degree @xmath11 and out - degree one .",
    "* variables @xmath9 have in - degree at most one .",
    "this means that all regulating variables are collected in one single constraint @xmath18 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : function ] ) ) .    setting @xmath30 , the degree distribution of variable nodes approaches asymptotically @xmath31 _ i.e. _",
    "the out - degree distribution is a poissonian of mean @xmath32 , while in - degree distribution is bimodal . since in- and out - degrees are uncorrelated ,",
    "the joint degree distribution factorises : @xmath33 .",
    "random factor graphs are obviously a drastic oversimplification for a true grn , since the available data show evidence for a scale - free @xmath34 and a large but concentrated in - degree distribution of function nodes more compatible with an exponential - like form @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this simplified model allows for many detailed analytic predictions that can guide our comprehension in more realistic and interesting cases , and is a well - controlled testing ground for techniques borrowed from statistical mechanics .",
    "such techniques are not limited to random graphs and can be easily extended to deal with more realistic cases .",
    "in general , we can distinguish three sets of variables as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : sandwich ] :    * _ external input variables : _ there are @xmath35 variables which are not regulated by any function .",
    "they represent external inputs to the network , as e.g.  chemical concentrations of non - proteins .",
    "we do not consider these external inputs as dynamical variables of the system .",
    "in the original definition of kauffman networks they are in fact included into the definition of the bn itself : this definition works at @xmath36 but allows for constant functions , whose outputs are the analogues of our external input variables . * _ regulatory variables _ are all those variables which are regulated and regulate .",
    "they can therefore be considered as transcription factors . *",
    "_ functional variables : _ there are @xmath37 variables which do not regulate any other function .",
    "these are to be identified with functional proteins not involved in transcriptional regulation , but acting instead as enzymes , membrane channels etc .",
    "one has to note that in a random network there are some variables which belong theoretically to both the external and the functional variables because they are isolated .",
    "they contribute only trivially to the behaviour of the network and can therefore be neglected in the discussion .",
    ".truth table for all 16 boolean functions of @xmath0 inputs . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     function are organised in decreasing replica symmetry breaking order : function types that undergo the ground - state clustering transition earlier in @xmath38 are drawn first .",
    "complexity curves for bn including purely functions from one class are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3-sigma ] . as for @xmath0 ,",
    "each curve is averaged over @xmath39 samples at @xmath40 . within one npn class , functions where chosen at random with uniform probability .",
    "we tested that sample to sample fluctuations are small ( smaller than the points size ) already for @xmath41 .",
    "finite size effect become negligible beyond @xmath42 .    .",
    "inset : enlargement of the region close to @xmath43 : no crossing is observed . ]    generally , for function types that break replica symmetry earlier , the complexity is higher .",
    "this rule has an exception for types @xmath44 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3-sigma ] ) .",
    "complexity curves for each function type do no intersect below the critical point at @xmath43 , where all complexities vanish simultaneously .",
    "function types @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 seem to have a complexity degeneracy along the whole @xmath48 curve .",
    "the degeneracy is resolved for type @xmath47 with tests at @xmath49 , but persist for the other two types .",
    "we do not expect this degeneracy to be exact , but numerical values on an average of @xmath39 @xmath50 samples are not distinguishable , as well as on a test at @xmath49 .",
    "it is also possible to rank function types according to their `` distance '' from the pure xor node .",
    "there are , however , many non - rigorous measures of distance . one intuitive example is the number @xmath51 of cube links connecting two vertices of identical colour .",
    "another possibility is looking at the xor - like nature of the node on sub - planes , _",
    "i.e. _  with one fixed input variable .",
    "both indicators are shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : k3fun ] .",
    "@xmath52 function types are the only ones that do not show a complexity transition .",
    "they are also the completely canalising nodes , _",
    "i.e. _  canalising in every variable .",
    "an exhaustive test of all possible mixtures of function types goes beyond the scope of this work . in order to test whether any small fraction of any rsb - responsible function type leads to an ( albeit small ) rsb transition close to @xmath36 , we calculated the complexity for the 5 nodes types for which clustering is less pronounced , mixing each type with a given fraction @xmath53 of pure and - or nodes .",
    "as expected , the transition point shifts continuously toward @xmath36 for each case , and the complexity curve lowers , nevertheless without disappearing for @xmath54 .",
    "we conjecture therefore a complex phase to be always present in the large @xmath7 limit , besides in the single boundary case of @xmath55 .",
    "some complexity curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma - mixed ] .     for nodes types",
    "9 ( red ) , 13 ( pink ) , 4 ( dark blue ) , 3 ( green ) , 5 ( light blue ) for different increasing values of @xmath53 . type 9,13,4 : @xmath56 .",
    "type 3,5:@xmath57 . ]      for @xmath58 , we have done some non - exhaustive numerical checks , and extended the analytical calculation of the pure xor - type model .",
    "the main results are :    * the minimum of the clustering point @xmath59 over all combinations of functional classes is always given by the pure @xmath11-xor class ( the only one being completely analytically accessible ) .",
    "we find @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "note that the range of the complex phase becomes larger with @xmath11 , and asymptotically approaches zero .",
    "* we conjecture that , for fixed @xmath11 , the only class not leading to clustering is the pure @xmath11-and - or one .",
    "this has been checked explicitly for @xmath64 , and non - exhaustively also for @xmath65 .",
    "this class becomes , however , both combinatorially and biologically less important for higher @xmath11 , where threshold - like functions are expected to be more relevant .",
    "the non - exhaustive numerical checks for the @xmath65 case where done on threshold - like functions ( selected due to the conjectured biological relevance at high @xmath11 values ) , and on a subset of 10 npn classes that are expected to undergo a less pronounced clustering transition on the basis of the @xmath66 insight .",
    "we always found a transition point close to but distinct from @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , it is clear from the nature of the nodes ( see again fig .",
    "( [ fig:3-cubes ] ) ) that neither local nor global paramagneticity of the system ( as opposed to complete xor nodes ) needs to be preserved in order to observe clustering .",
    "it is therefore possible to build a whole zoology of networks that leave great freedom on the numerical value of the number of solution clusters and of the fraction of variables fixed in a preferred direction ( active or inactive from the point of view of boolean control ) .",
    "after having analysed in great detail the sudden emergence of a computational core and the number and organisation of fixed points in random boolean networks , we are now applying some of the ideas to known gene - regulatory networks .",
    "the methods used in the analysis of ensembles of random boolean networks , namely percolation arguments and the cavity method , can be translated into algorithms acting on single graphs .",
    "this is obvious for the determination of the core since its very definition is iterative , but it is also true for the cavity method which can be reformulated in terms of message - passing techniques , including belief propagation and survey propagation as given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bp ] ) and ( [ eq : sp ] ) .",
    "the results below have to be understood as an illustration for potential applications of our approach to other large - scale networks .",
    "one of the largest - scale genome - wide grn known so far is the one of baker s yeast _ s. cerevisi _ , for which we used data from uri alon s lab @xcite . for this regulatory network , only the topological structure is known , _",
    "i.e. _  a list of transcription factors to regulated genes is given , but the specific combinatorial control of the expression level depending on the existence and/or concentration of the transcription factors is unknown .",
    "therefore , we were able to apply only the strictly topological part of the per and lr removal procedures , the function - specific steps for canalising functions in per and for non - canalising ones in lr were omitted .",
    "the computational core found in this way is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : yeast ] .",
    "even if it consists only of four genes , this result is highly interesting .",
    "the present genes are exactly those four genes in the network which are responsible for nitrogen control in yeast .",
    "nitrogen is , however , the most important mineral nutrient for yeast .",
    "if it is present in abundance , yeast cells live and proliferate independently from each other . under nitrogen starvation ,",
    "yeast cells perform some cooperative action : under cell division they grow into multi - cellular filaments , the so - called _ pseudohyph _ , which are capable to invade new , nutrient rich regions of the surrounding medium .",
    "the main mechanism hereby is nitrogen catabolite repression ( ncr ) @xcite , which down - regulates proteins responsible for using secondary nitrogen sources in the presence of the `` preferred '' sources . the behaviour of this gene core was studied in detail only very recently @xcite on the basis of differential equations .",
    "the segment - polarity genes in fruit fly _ drosophila melanogaster _ are the last step of a cascade of regulatory interactions responsible for the onset of dorso - ventral segmentation during the embryonic stage of development .",
    "the stable maintenance of segment - polarity gene expression is crucial in the development and stability of the parasegmental segment furrows @xcite .",
    "a detailed boolean model , being able to capture wild type and various mutant gene expression patterns as fixed points of the network , has been recently proposed by albert and othmer @xcite .",
    "the model consists of a network of 60 variables and 56 function nodes as a representation of a single parasegment of four cells , each one composed of 15 boolean variables and 14 function nodes .",
    "the network is therefore modular and each module can be described in terms of the following set of boolean equations : @xmath67\\nonumber\\\\   wg_i&=&wg_i\\nonumber\\\\    en_i&=&(wg_{i-1 } \\mbox { or } wg_{i+1 } ) \\mbox { and not } slp_i\\nonumber\\\\   en_i&=&en_i\\nonumber\\\\   hh_i&=&en_i \\mbox { and not } cir_i\\nonumber\\\\ hh_i&=&hh_i\\nonumber\\\\   ptc_i&=&cia_i \\mbox { and   not } en_i \\mbox { and not } cir_i \\\\   ptc_i&=&ptc_i \\mbox { or } ( ptc_i \\mbox { and not } hh_{i-1 } \\mbox { and not }   hh_{i+1})\\nonumber\\\\   ph_i&=&ptc_i \\mbox { and } ( hh_{i-1 } \\mbox { or } hh_{i+1})\\nonumber\\\\   smo_i&=&\\mbox { not }",

    "( [ eq : stable ] ) .",
    "we have found that the whole network , except for the nodes @xmath68 , forms the computational core .",
    "we find ourselves thus in the opposite situation of the yeast network , where only the small nitrogen regulatory module belongs to the cc .",
    "this difference is even more astonishing since the bn ( [ eq : stable ] ) is only a small sub - network of the full gene - regulatory mechanism in _",
    "drosophila_. our observation underlines therefore the more complex structure of grns of higher organisms compared to simpler ones .",
    "bn ( [ eq : stable ] ) is known to have 10 solutions , among which only one represents the wild type @xcite .",
    "we have applied belief propagation to the network . even if this algorithm is expected to become exact only on large , locally tree - like networks ,",
    "its prediction of about 12 fixed points is rather accurate compared to the exact result .",
    "more interesting is , however , the result of _ in silico gene - knockout experiments _ : fixing single variables to a value not occurring in any of the ten fixed points , bp immediately predicts a negative entropy . seen the discrete nature of the boolean variables , this result has to be interpreted in terms of non - existing fixed points .",
    "bp is thus able to identify _ essential variables_. this strategy can be easily extended to _ in silico _ experiments restricting more than one variable and thus allows to generate valuable hypotheses and suggestions for real experiments .    in order to recover fixed points ,",
    "one has to setup _",
    "ad hoc _ strategies for fixing variables .",
    "bp can be exploited in order to iteratively generate solutions of the problem using a _ decimation _",
    "technique @xcite .",
    "the idea is the following : run bp , fix the most biased boolean variable ( _ i.e. _  the variable having the highest probability to be 0 or 1 ) to its more probable boolean value , and iterate the previous 2 steps until all spins are fixed .",
    "surprisingly enough , the decimation process based on bp leads to the wild - type expression pattern - which is also the one having the largest basin of attraction from the dynamical point of view .",
    "we have also checked the robustness of the fixed points of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : stable ] ) with respect to noise . in a boolean",
    "setting , the latter amounts to fluctuations in the output of the boolean functions .",
    "we have checked this in the _ drosophila _ network : noise is introduced by replacing the term @xmath69 with the finite - temperature boltzmann term @xmath70 $ ] . for not too large formal temperature @xmath71 , we always recover the correct wild - type solution under decimation .",
    "increasing continuously the noise , the distance of the bp solution to its zero - temperature counter part increases slowly .",
    "this technique can be used in order to prune out of the whole set of solutions those that are most sensitive to perturbations .",
    "finally , we have also run the sp algorithm on this network , but we did not find any sign of clustering solutions ( even in case we relax the initial conditions , letting free all variables @xmath72 - see the first of eq .",

    "the transition is continuous , above discontinuous in the core size .",

    "this phenomenon is found to be robust with respect to the selection of the boolean functions , and covers an increasing part of the phase diagram if we go to a higher number @xmath11 of inputs to the boolean functions .",
    "all the methods applied to random boolean networks have also been formulated as algorithms which can be applied to analyse arbitrary networks . as a demonstration of possible applications",
    ", we have run these algorithms on two biological gene - regulatory networks , namely those of yeast and of the segment - polarity genes in fruit fly .",
    "we have first confirmed that the method is able to identify a biologically sensible computational core of both networks .",
    "the message passing algorithms based on the cavity method ( _ i.e. _ belief and survey propagation ) could be applied only to the fruit - fly case where the boolean regulation is known : the number of fixed points was predicted rather accurately . in some _ in silico gene - knockout experiments",

    "first , our analysis is based on ground states of a hamiltonian counting the number of violated functions , which is not directly related to any biologically motivated dynamics .",
    "the _ dynamical accessibility _ of fixed points remains an open challenge which will be addressed in a future project .",
    "moreover , noise sources present in real cases may force the network to quasi - stationary points close to the fixed ones ( some regulation might not always function properly , without affecting the overall state of a cell ) . in this view",
    ", the study of the organisation and accessibility of meta - stable states in the region of low complexity and in the case of fixed external inputs , together with their relation with quasi - stationary points , might be relevant .",
    "a second major direction for future research should be the application to more complex biological cases , which is expected to give results going beyond the simple test cases reported in this work . however , very few genome - wide networks are available so far . in particular , for multi - cellular organisms only small functional modules for well - described functions are known .",
