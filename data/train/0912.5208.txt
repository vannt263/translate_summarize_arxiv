    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is an important target in the effort to understand the stellar populations of galaxies , due to its close proximity , favorable viewing angle , ongoing star - formation activity ( harris & zaritsky , 2009 ) and relatively low metallicity . the lmc cluster system is well known to show a puzzling age distribution , with a handful of old ( @xmath013 gyr ) , metal - poor globular clusters and a number of intermediate - age ( 1 - 3 gyr ) , relatively metal - rich populous clusters , with only a single cluster ` eso 121-sc03 ' in between ( mackey et al .",
    "2006 and mateo et al .",
    "the chemical enrichment of the lmc has been studied in some detail recently by harris & zaritsky ( 2009 ) and carrera et al .",
    "the early history of the lmc was characterized by rapid enrichment , reaching [ fe / h]=@xmath2 by about 12 gyr ago ( harris & zaritsky , 2009 ) .",
    "the metallicity then increased only slightly throughout the long quiescent epoch .",
    "when cluster formation resumed some 3 gyr ago , the chemical abundances began a steady ascent to the present - day value of [ fe / h]=@xmath3 - @xmath4 ( carrera et al .",
    "2008 ; hill et al .",
    "1995 ; and rolleston , trundle & dufton 2002 ) .",
    "these features provide clues to the history of star formation in the lmc .",
    "there was an initial epoch of star formation during which a significant portion of the lmc s stellar mass was formed .",
    "this era was followed by a long quiescent epoch , during which cluster formation was suppressed throughout the lmc .",
    "then , about 3 gyr ago , cluster formation resumed throughout the lmc , and has been ongoing since .",
    "the global resumption of star formation is strongly suggestive of a dramatic change at this point in the lmc s past , such as the merger of a gas - rich dwarf galaxy or a particularly dramatic tidal encounter , probably with the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) given the similar resumption of star formation seen in that galaxy s star formation history ( sfh ) ( harris & zaritsky , 2009 ) .",
    "bekki et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggest that the recent burst of cluster formation is linked to the first very close encounter between the clouds about 4 gyr ago , which would have induced dramatic gas cloud collisions , allowing the lmc to begin a new epoch of cluster and star formation ; strong tidal interactions between the clouds have likely sustained the enhanced cluster formation .",
    "bekki et al .",
    "( 2004 ) also find that the close encounter between the lmc and smc would have been sufficient to cause the formation of the lmc bar around the time of the new epoch of cluster formation , giving rise to the similar sfhs seen in the cluster system and the bar ( cole et al .",
    "2005 , hereafter c05 ) .",
    "in addition to enhancing star formation , tidal forces can result in the in - fall or outflow of material , thereby affecting the chemical evolution history ( ceh ) of the lmc and , at the same time , leaving behind a signature of the interaction .",
    "thus , accurate knowledge of the ages and metallicities of lmc clusters is necessary to fully understand the formation and dynamical history of this galaxy .",
    "here it is worthwhile to mention that recently kallivayalil et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2009 ) , using hst data for fields in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) centered on background quasars , determined the proper motions of the lmc and smc .",
    "they argued that the mcs may not be bound to each other or the milky way ( mw ) and may in fact be passing the mw for the first time , although , to further verify and refine these results , more precise data is needed .",
    "red giant branch ( rgb ) stars are among the brightest red stars in stellar systems that are older than @xmath0 a gyr .",
    "they appear in almost all galaxies .",
    "therefore , red giants are an excellent tool for probing the parameters of old populations and the history of star formation in almost any galaxy .",
    "globular clusters , with their single age and metallicity , are the ideal sites for calibrating the rgb parameters . since da costa & armandroff ( 1990 ) explored the possibility to use the color of the rgb as a metallicity indicator , many signicant advances have been made , both in the improvement of the astronomical instrumentation and the development of the corresponding theory .",
    "kuchinski et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and minniti et al .",
    "( 1995 ) demonstrated both empirically and theoretically that the slope of the rgb in a @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) is sensitive to the metallicity of the population .",
    "they investigated this correlation for metal - rich globular clusters and derived a linear relation between [ fe / h ] and rgb slope .",
    "ivanov et al . ( 2000 ) extended this relation to metallicities as low as [ fe / h ] = @xmath7 .",
    "ferraro et al . ( 2000 ) derived a similar relation .",
    "ivanov & borissova ( 2002 ) tabulated the relation in [ @xmath8 , @xmath9 , [ fe / h ] ] space based on a large sample of 2mass photometry of mw globular clusters .",
    "tiede et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , using 4 galactic open clusters , derived the slope of the rgb - metallicity relation for a younger population and kyeong & byun ( 2001 ) re - derived the calibration adding 10 new galactic open clusters . and",
    "finally , tiede et al . (",
    "2002 ) found two very clear linear trends , one for galactic open clusters spanning @xmath10 [ fe / h ] @xmath11 and another for galactic globular clusters spanning @xmath12 [ fe / h ] @xmath13 .    to derive the general relation between slope of the rgb ,",
    "[ fe / h ] and age , we have to extend the existing calibrations to the clusters in external galaxies , because there are no galactic counterparts of the young metal - poor mc clusters .",
    "accordingly , we observed more than a dozen clusters in the lmc and smc in december , 2004 with the wfirc attached to the 2.5-m du pont telescope in the las campanas observatory .",
    "thus , we have very good - quality cmds , which allow us to determine the slope of the rgb of the clusters",
    ". the ages of the clusters are determined from good- quality hst cmds with well - defined main - sequence turn - off points .",
    "the metallicities of most clusters in our rgb slope sample are based on the latest spectroscopic measurements available in the literature ( g06 ) .",
    "there are eight clusters given in table [ log ] , however , with no modern metallicity determination .",
    "there is an empirically developed , simply calibrated method available which can make an efficient estimate of metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) for individual rgb stars using the strength of the ca ii triplet ( cat ) lines at 8498 , 8542 , and 8662 (battaglia et al .",
    "2008 ; carrera et al . 2007 ; cole et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter c04 ; c05 ; grocholski 2006 , hereafter g06 ; parisi 2009 , hereafter p09 ; warren & cole 2009 etc . ) . a powerful application of this method to the age - metallicity relation and abundance gradient of the star clusters of the lmc and smc",
    "were already demonstrated by g06 and p09 , following up on the pioneering work by olszewski et al .",
    "( 1991 , hereafter o91 ) . therefore , to derive the metallicity , we obtained medium - resolution spectra at the near - infrared cat using the fors2 multiobject spectrograph at the 8.2-meter vlt / ut1 with high signal - to - noise ( @xmath14 ) ratio .",
    "the benefit of using cat is that it is very efficient ; not only are rgb stars near their brightest in the infrared , but the multiplexing capabilities of many moderate - resolution spectrograph s allow the observation of dozens of stars simultaneously , greatly increasing the probability of identifying cluster members ( p09 ) .",
    "in addition , the metallicity calibration is very straightforward and well calibrated and independent of luminosity , distance , reddening and age .",
    "therefore , using fors2 on the vlt , we were able to identify 77 member stars in eight massive lmc clusters and determine accurate mean cluster velocities and metallicities .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the metallicity distribution , their relationship and the kinematics of lmc clusters , extending the work done by g06 .",
    "we will further discuss the relation between rgb slope , metallicity and age in an upcoming paper ( kurtev et al .",
    "2010 ) . in  2 ,  3 ,  4 , and  5",
    ", we discuss the observations , techniques required to determine radial velocity & metallicity and the cluster membership criteria . in  6 &  7 , we present the basic cluster parameters based on our photometry and spectroscopy and analyze the results , followed by conclusions in  8 .",
    "short exposure images of eight lmc clusters were observed with fors2 , vlt , through the filters @xmath15 and @xmath16 under excellent atmospheric conditions ( seeing @xmath17 0.7 arcsec ) on 5 october 2006 and 17 november 2006 .",
    "fors2 was used in normal resolution with the pixel size of 0.25@xmath18/pixel and field of view of @xmath19 , which allowed us to sample , in the outermost field regions , a good portion of the background lmc field .",
    "the coordinates of the clusters as well as the total exposure times are listed in table [ log ] .",
    "de - biasing and flat - fielding were performed with standard iraf packages , using the calibration frames ( bias and sky flat fields ) obtained during the same nights as the target observations .",
    "photometric reduction was carried out with the daophot  ii / allframe package ( stetson 1987 , 1994 ) .",
    "stellar psf models for each frame were obtained by means of a large set of uncrowded and unsaturated stars .",
    "the mean photometric errors are 0.003 - 0.009 mag for ( @xmath20 ) @xmath17 20 mag and between 0.01 mag and 0.03 mag for the fainter magnitudes .",
    "the nights were photometric and the calibration to the johnson standard photometric system was performed by comparison of the stars in the landolt ( 1992 ) field pg2213 - 006 .",
    "the maximum zero - point errors are calculated as @xmath21 0.01 - 0.02 magnitudes .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were carried out with fors2 in visitor mode at the antu ( vlt - ut1 ) 8.2 m telescope at eso s paranal observatory during the night of 16 - 17 november 2006 .",
    "we used the fors2 spectrograph in mask exchange unit ( mxu ) mode , with the 1028z+29 grism and og590 + 32 order blocking filter .",
    "the mxu slit mask configuration allows the placement of more slits ( in this case 37 ) on the sky than the 19 movable slits provided in multi object spectrograph mode .",
    "targets were selected so as to maximize the number of likely cluster members observed ; typically 20 stars inside our estimated cluster radius ( see  5 ) were observed , with an additional 15 stars outside of this radius that appeared to be lmc field red giants based on our infrared photometry with the du pont telescope .",
    "we used slits that were 1@xmath22 wide and 6.25@xmath22 long . in all fields",
    ", we obtained 3 to 4 separate 600s exposures , taken under seeing less than @xmath23 .",
    "they were average combined to form the final spectra .",
    "pixels were binned @xmath24 , yielding a plate scale of 0.25@xmath22 pixel@xmath25 .",
    "we used the upper ( master ccd ) of fors2 for observations of the target clusters which has a readout noise of 2.9 @xmath26 and inverse gain of 0.7 @xmath26 adu@xmath25 .",
    "the spectra have a dispersion of @xmath27  / pixel ( which corresponds to a resolution of 2 - 3  ) with a characteristic rms scatter of  0.06  , and cover a range of @xmath28   in the region of the cat ( 8498 , 8542 , and 8662  ) . for the final spectra , s /",
    "n is typically 40 - 60 pixel@xmath25 with some stars as high as @xmath29 pixel@xmath25 and , in some few cases , as low as @xmath30 pixel@xmath25 . for the present study we use spectra having s / n @xmath31 pixel@xmath25 .",
    "calibration exposures , bias frames and flat - fields were also taken as a part of the standard calibration plan .",
    "we used the iraf task ccdproc to fit and subtract the over - scan region , trim the images , and flat - field each image .",
    "flats were corrected for the lamp shape by the task response .",
    "we used the task apall to define the sky background and extract the stellar spectra onto one dimension .",
    "the sky level was defined by performing a linear fit across the dispersion direction to sky windows on each side of the star .",
    "when the star fell near the top or bottom of the slitlet ; the sky regions were chosen interactively .",
    "the tasks identify and dispcor were used to calculate and apply the dispersion solution for each spectrum . finally , the spectra were continuum normalized by fitting a polynomial to the stellar continuum .",
    "examples of the final spectra in the cat region can be seen in figure [ spec ] .",
    "clearly , the three ca ii lines dominate the red giant s spectra in this region .",
    "also note the stronger ca lines in the bottom spectrum , which , given the very similar @xmath32 and log @xmath33 values ( as indicated by their virtually identical @xmath34 values , i.e. the mag difference between the star and the horizontal branch ) , graphically illustrates the higher metallicity of the bottom spectrum and the power of the cat technique .",
    "radial velocity measurements for our target stars has been done to help us in defining the cluster membership as well as to study the kinematics of the lmc . since a cluster s velocity dispersion",
    "is expected to be relatively small compared to the surrounding field and its mean velocity quite possibly distinct from the field , radial velocities are an excellent tool for determining cluster membership .",
    "radial velocities for all the target stars were determined through cross - correlation with eight template spectra from ngc 1851 ( carerra et al .",
    "2007 ) using the iraf task fxcor ( tonry & davis 1979 ) .",
    "these template stars were observed as a part of the cat calibration program ; thus , this sample offers a good match to the spectral types of our target stars .",
    "in addition , these observations were made with a telescope and instrument setup that is almost identical to those used by us .",
    "in addition to calculating relative radial velocities , fxcor uses information about the observatory location , date and the time of the observations ( once the eso header has been appropriately reformatted ) to correct the derived velocities to the heliocentric reference frame . for a star s final heliocentric radial velocity ,",
    "we adopt the mean of all cross - correlation results .",
    "we find good agreement among the template - derived velocities , with a typical standard deviation of 8 km s@xmath25 .",
    "having used the same set up as g06 , we follow the same approach to calculate the error due to imprecise alignment of the slit center and the stellar centroid .",
    "g06 estimate this latter error as @xmath35 km @xmath36 .",
    "this , together with the the standard deviation of 8 km s@xmath25 gives a typical error of 9 km s@xmath25 in measuring the radial velocity in the present study .",
    "the abundances of the clusters in the present sample have been derived from the equivalent width ( ew ) of strong cat lines in individual rgb stars based on the empirically developed method which has been explored already in detail previously ( see for eg .",
    "c04 , c05 , g06 , p06 ) .",
    "the cat lines can be contaminated by weak neutral metal lines , and the continuum may be affected by weak molecular bands .",
    "both effects make it impossible to measure the ` true ' ews of the cat lines in isolation .",
    "armandroff & zinn ( 1988 ) defined two pseudocontinum windows in line free regions on either side of each feature .",
    "for each of the ca ii lines , the line connecting the average number of the counts in each of these two windows was defined to be the pseudocontinum .",
    "the pseudo - equivalent width was then computed by taking the integral over the feature boundaries of the difference between the pseudocontinum and the spectrum .",
    "further , c04 mentioned that the spectra need not be flux - calibrated because the continuum slopes of red giants in this wavelength range are generally close to flat , so a simple normalization by an arbitrary polynomial suffices for measurement of the ` pseudo - equivalent width ' . in the present study , we calculate the ew by direct pixel - to - pixel integration using the interactive splot program of iraf .",
    "the ews are measured by visually marking two continuum points at the line band pass given by armandroff & zinn ( 1988 ) . the continuum level , which is a linear function between these two marked points , is effectively fixed at 1 by our normalization procedure .",
    "the integral is taken between these two points .",
    "since our spectra are of high enough quality that all three cat lines are well measured , we define our metallicity index @xmath37 , as the sum of the ews of three cat lines ( see for eg .",
    "c04 , g06 , and p09 ) .",
    "although theoretical and empirical studies have shown that effective temperature , surface gravity , and [ fe / h ] all play a role in cat line strengths ( e.g. , jorgensen et al .",
    "1992 ; cenarro et al .",
    "2002 ) , armandroff & da costa ( 1991 ) showed that there is a linear relationship between a star s absolute magnitude and @xmath37 for red giants of a given metallicity . following previous authors using the same cat technique ( g06 & p09 ) , we define a reduced equivalent width , w@xmath38 , to remove the effects of surface gravity and temperature on @xmath37 via its luminosity dependence :    @xmath39    the introduction of the difference between the visual magnitude of the star ( @xmath15 ) and the cluster s horizontal branch / red clump @xmath40 in calculating w@xmath38 , also removes any dependence on cluster distance and interstellar reddening .",
    "the value of @xmath41 has been investigated in detail by previous authors ( c04 , g06 , p09 ) and we have adopted the value obtained by c04 : @xmath42 .",
    "we chose c04 s value of @xmath41 because they used both globular and open clusters , covering a broad range of ages , to derive it and their instrumental setup is very similar to ours .",
    "we note that , as discussed in detail in g06 , the use of c04 s value for @xmath41 , combined with defining the brightness of our target rgb stars relative to the hb of their parent cluster , incorporate any age effects into the cat calibration , thus it is not necessary to make any corrections for the ages of our clusters .    as shown by rutledge et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , there is a linear relationship between a cluster s reduced ew and its metallicity on the carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) abundance scale for globular clusters of the mw .",
    "c04 extended this calibration to a wider range of ages ( @xmath43 gyr @xmath44 age @xmath44 13 gyr ) and metallicities @xmath45 [ fe / h ] @xmath46 by combining the metallicity scales of carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) and friel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for globular and open clusters , respectively .",
    "although many of our clusters are younger than 2.5 gyr , we adopted the c04 relationship ,    [ fe / h ] = @xmath47 ,    to derive the metallicities of our entire cluster sample .",
    "carrera et al .",
    "( 2007 ) investigated the behavior of cat in the age range of 0.25 gyr @xmath44 age @xmath44 13 gyr and the metallicity range @xmath48 [ fe / h ] @xmath49 .",
    "in spite of the extended age range of their calibration , we decided to use c04 s calibration for three reasons .",
    "first , the calibration of carrera et al .",
    "( 2007 ) uses the absolute magnitude of a target star ( rather than the brightness relative to the hb , as we have adopted ) , thus requiring accurate photometric calibration and distance to the star .",
    "second , using @xmath50 instead of absolute magnitude removes the need to make any assumptions about the foreground reddening toward a cluster . finally , carrera et al .",
    "( 2007 ) performed estimates of the differences in w@xmath38 as a function of age using the jorgensen et al .",
    "( 1992 ) models and basti stellar evolution models ( pietrinferni et al . 2004 ) . from their data",
    ", they confirmed that the influence of age is small ( for clusters having age 10.5 and 0.6 gyr , the difference in metallicity is @xmath51 dex ) , even for ages @xmath17 1 gyr .",
    "based on these results , we are confident that the c04 calibration can be accurately extended to younger ages ( see also p09 ) .    in addition , battaglia et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have shown that [ fe / h ] values derived from cat agree with those from high resolution spectroscopy and detailed model atmosphere analysis to within 0.1 - 0.2 dex over the range @xmath52 [ fe / h ] @xmath53 , based on flames data for a large sample of stars in the sculptor and fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "it is well known that such stars have distinct [ ca / fe ] ratios from those in the galactic globular cluster calibrators ( e.g. , shetrone et al .",
    "2001 ; geisler et al . 2007 ) and also possess a larger range of stellar ages , extending to much smaller values .",
    "nevertheless , cat yields metallicities that are very close to real fe abundances , reinforcing our confidence in the technique .    with the assumption that each star in a given cluster has the same metallicity and thus the same @xmath54 value , the error on @xmath54 , @xmath55 , depends on the standard deviation of the individual star s @xmath54 values about the mean cluster value as well as the number of stars , n , used in each cluster ( see also warren & cole 2009 ) i.e. @xmath56 , this error is further propagated to define errors in calculating the [ fe / h ] .",
    "our estimate of the systematic error per star ranges from 0.08 to 0.14 dex , with a mean of 0.11 dex .",
    "cluster membership criteria are very crucial in defining the parameters for the clusters .",
    "we use a combination of several criteria to isolate cluster members from field stars as defined by g06 .",
    "first , all observed targets were selected on the base of the statistically decontaminated near - ir cmds ( kurtev et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "second , the cluster centers and radii are chosen by eye , based primarily on the photometric catalog ( @xmath57 ) . as an example , figure [ map ] _",
    "( left panel ) _ shows ( x , y)-positions for all stars photometered in the ngc 1754 and ngc 1900 fields respectively , with large dots denoting our target stars and the large open circle representing the adopted cluster radius ; stars outside this circle are considered non - members due to their large distance from the cluster center .",
    "we note that stars outside the cluster radius were observed so as to define parameters for the lmc field , which aids in isolating cluster members .",
    "next , radial velocity versus radial distance is plotted in figure [ map ] _",
    "( right panel)_. stars moving with the velocity of the clusters are easily identified due to their smaller velocity dispersion .",
    "our velocity cut , denoted by the horizontal lines , has been chosen to include the expected observed velocity dispersion in each cluster . to determine this ,",
    "we have adopted an intrinsic cluster velocity dispersion of 5 km @xmath36 and added this in quadrature with our adopted radial velocity error , 9 km @xmath36 , resulting in a dispersion of @xmath58 km @xmath36 .",
    "thus , we adopted a width of @xmath2111 km @xmath36 for our radial velocity cut .",
    "we select the cluster velocity to maximize the number of stars lying within this range . the cluster radius ( figure [ map ] _ ( right panel ) _ , vertical line ) is also marked for reference .",
    "finally , figure [ eq ] shows metallicity as a function of distance for the stars in ngc 1754 and ngc 1900 respectively , with horizontal lines representing the [ fe / h ] cut of @xmath59 dex that has been applied to these data .",
    "we adopt random error of @xmath60 dex in measuring each individual [ fe / h ] , this along with a typical systematic error of @xmath61 dex gives total error in measurement @xmath62 dex .",
    "thus , we have rounded this figure to @xmath59 dex .",
    "radial velocity members which are in this range of metallicity are assumed to be probable cluster member .",
    "star symbols denote stars that have made all of these cuts and are therefore considered to be cluster members .    in figure [ hb ]",
    "we present the traditional @xmath63w versus @xmath34 plot for cluster members of ngc 1754 and 1900 with the lines representing the mean metallicity of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , with a standard error of the mean = 0.03 .",

    "figure  [ cmd_all ] shows the cmds of the eight lmc clusters .",
    "all the stars measured with good precision ( error in mag @xmath170.1 ) in the whole fors2 frames are plotted here : therefore the cmds include both cluster and field stars . to check the zero point of our calibrations",

    "2000 , see their table  1 . ) .",
    "the clusters from our sample are located in areas densely populated by field stars . in order to obtain a cleaner cluster cmd",
    ", we proceeded in the following way .",
    "for each cluster , an annulus around the center was selected with the criterion of being large enough to contain most cluster stars , but small enough to minimize the background contribution .",
    "the small circular region containing the very center of some of the clusters was excluded because these areas were too crowded , and therefore the photometry was rather poor .",
    "the photometry around very bright stars projected close to the objects ngc1786 , sl826 , and ngc1754 is also removed .",
    "a cmd typical of lmc field stars was extracted from a second region , well outside a given radius around the cluster center , selected with the criterion of containing a number of stars large enough to insure good statistics , but far enough from the cluster not to contain a significant fraction of cluster stars .",
    "the cluster and reference fields cover the same area .",
    "the full range of magnitude and colors of a given cmd was divided into grids and we computed the expected number - density of field stars in each cell based on the number of comparison field stars .",
    "after that the expected number of field stars is randomly subtracted from each cell .",
    "the statistically de - contaminated cmds are plotted in figure  [ cmd_all ] as dark dots .    to check our de - contamination procedure we calculated the stellar surface - density distributions ( number of stars per arcmin@xmath67 ) ( bonatto & bica , 2006 ) .",
    "they are computed for a mesh size of @xmath68 arcmin@xmath67 , centered on the apparent cluster center .",
    "figure[radec_count ] , left panel shows observed photometry of ngc1795 , while on the right - hand panel only the stars selected by means of the color - magnitude filter described above are plotted .",

    "most of them show typical diagrams of intermediate age clusters .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ cmd_all_cl ] we can not reach the turn off / termination point ( to ) for ngc1795 ; ngc1754 ; ngc1786 ; hodge2 because of the crowding and short exposure times . for the rest of the clusters from our sample : ngc1900 ; sl509 ; sl817 ; and sl862 the main sequence can be followed up to 4 magnitudes bellow the to .",
    "the rc stars are located between @xmath69 19 - 19.3 mag and the rgb extends between 2 and 4 magnitudes brightward of the rc .",
    "ngc1754 , and to a lesser extent ngc1786 , show well populated horizontal branches ( hb ) .",
    "the goal of this project is to obtain homogeneous [ fe / h ] values and ages to be used for calibration of the near - infrared @xmath70-band rgb slope - metallicity - age relation .",
    "the determination of the metallicities is described in  4 .",
    "the most reliable technique for age determination is to examine the luminosity of the main sequence turnoff and compare it to the predictions of theoretical isochrones .",

    "we can easily see there is less scatter in [ fe / h ] values for the clusters using the cat method .",

    "prior to the age gap , the lmc formed a number of low - metallicity populous clusters , analogous to the mw s globular cluster population . following the age gap ,",
    "cluster formation resumed in the lmc , and proceeded roughly continuously to the present day .",
    "the clusters formed following the age gap have less dispersion in metallicity and are signicantly more enriched than the ancient cluster population , and there is some evidence for further enrichment with time for ages @xmath103 gyr .",

    "( 2008 ) have examined the amr for field stellar populations , based on cat spectroscopy of individual red giants in four lmc fields .",
    "they find that the disk amr is similar to that of the lmc star clusters : there was rapid initial enrichment to [ fe / h]@xmath122 by about 10 gyr ago .",
    "following this , the metallicity increased only slowly until 3 gyr ago , when it began a more rapid increase to its present - day value of [ fe / h]@xmath123 .",
    "however , the lack of objects with ages between 3 and 10 gyr is not observed in the field population .",
    "their reconstructed sfh ( for their inner disk fields ) indicates there was a relatively quiescent epoch between 5 and 10 gyr ago but some star formation occurred .",

    "carrera et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also showed that the bar amr differs from that of the disk in the last 3 gyr : while in the disk the metallicity has increased during this time , in the bar it has remained approximately constant .",
    "this would be in agreement with the prediction that a typical bar instability pushes the gas of the disk towards the center ( sellwood & wilkinson 1993 ) , so the infall gas is expected to be previously pre - enriched by the disk chemical evolution .",
    "this would be also the case in the scenario suggested by bekki & chiba ( 2005 ) , in which the bar would have formed from disk material as a consequence of tidal interactions between the lmc , the smc and the mw about 5 gyr ago , the epoch when the bar amr differed from that of the disk .",
    "also , a bar is expected to destroy any metallicity gradient within a certain radius , as is observed ( e.g. g06 ) .",
    "harris & zaritsky ( 2009 ) recently found that the chemical evolution history for the lmc is qualitatively similar to the one derived for the smc ( see harris & zaritsky 2004 ) . in both galaxies , the mean metallicity remained at an almost constant , low value , from @xmath010 gyr until about 4 gyr ago when the metallicity began a steady ascent to the present - day value . in both galaxies ,",

    "the galactic distribution of elemental abundances is central to study the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "the relative abundances of the elements are sensitive to the star formation history , the number of massive stars , the ratio of sn ia to ii , the importance of agb stars , the relative yield of the elements , and the exchange of matter between the galactic disk , bar and halo through infall or ejection .",

    "we have corrected for projection effects by adopting @xmath128 as the inclination and @xmath129 for the position angle of the line of nodes of the lmc ( van der marel & cioni 2001 and g06 ) . in this rotated coordinate system , a cluster with a position angle of zero lies along the line of nodes , and angles increase counterclockwise ( see g06 ) ; radial distances were converted from angular separation to kpc by assuming an lmc distance of @xmath130 = 18.5 ( @xmath050 kpc ) ; at this distance , @xmath131 is @xmath132 pc . in figure [ ddis ] we have over - plotted both the mw open cluster metallicity gradient from friel et al .",
    "( 2002 ; dashed line ) and the m33 gradient from tiede et al .",
    "( 2004 ; solid line ) .",
    "neither of these disk abundance gradients resembles what we see among the lmc clusters , which shows no evidence for a gradient .",
    "combined , these three figures illustrate that , similar to what was found by o91 ( and geisler et al .",
    "2003 , g06 ) , there is no [ fe / h ] gradient in terms of either position angle or radial distance for the higher metallicity clusters in our sample .",
    "it is well known that a number of metal - poor clusters ( [ fe / h ] @xmath133 ) exist in the inner portions of the lmc ( e.g. , o91 ) , suggesting that neither the metal - rich nor the metal - poor clusters exhibit a metallicity gradient . in the case of the lmc",
    ", the presence of a strong bar component may have diluted the metallicity gradient originally present in the star clusters , leading to a cluster population that is well mixed ( see g06 ) .",
    "geisler et al .",
    "( 2009 ) also found that the cluster distribution is similar to what has been found for red giant stars in the bar , which indicates that the bar and the intermediate age clusters have similar star formation histories .",
    "this is in good agreement with recent theoretical models that suggest the bar and intermediate age clusters formed as a result of a close encounter with the smc .",
    "our findings also confirm previous results which show that the lmc lacks the metallicity gradient typically seen in non - barred spiral galaxies , suggesting that the bar is driving the mixing of stellar populations in the lmc .",
    "the kinematical properties of the lmc provide important clues to its structure .",
    "they have been obtained from many tracers such as hi gas ( e.g. , rohlfs et al .",
    "1984 ; luks & rohlfs 1992 ; kim et al . 1998 ) , star clusters ( freeman , illingworth & oemler 1983 ; schommer et al . 1992 ) , planetary nebulae ( meatheringham et al . 1988 ) , hii regions and supergiants ( feitzinger , schmidt - kaler & isserstedt 1977 ) , and carbon stars ( kunkel et al . 1997 ; graff et al .",
    "2000 ; alves & nelson 2000 ; van der marel et al .",
    "all these studies imply that the lmc is kinematically cold , and must therefore to first approximation be a disk system ( van der marel 2004 ) .",
    "g06 also found their cluster sample has motions consistent with that of a single rotating disk system , with no indication of halo kinematics .",
    "to study the kinematics of the lmc , we followed the approach of g06 and schommer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) using star clusters as a tracers . to characterize the rotation of their clusters , schommer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) fit an equation of the form    @xmath134 ^ 2 + 1 \\}^{-0.5 } + v_{sys } $ ] + to their radial velocity data using a least - squares technique to derive the systemic velocity @xmath135 , the amplitude of the rotation velocity @xmath136 , and the orientation of the line of nodes ; they adopted an inclination of @xmath137 .",
    "their best - fit parameters give a rotation amplitude and dispersion consistent with the lmc clusters having disk like kinematics , with no indications of the existence of a pressure - supported halo .",
    "in figure [ potn ] we have plotted galactocentric radial velocity versus position angle on the sky for our sample ( 8 from present work + 28 from g06 ) , along with velocity data for all clusters listed in schommer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . to be consistent with the approach of schommer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , we have adopted the galactocentric velocity corrections given by feitzinger & weiss ( 1979 ) .",
    "in addition , for this figure only , we have adopted their lmc center ( @xmath138 [ j2000 ] ) for use in calculating the position angles of our clusters ( see also g06 ) .",
    "we have used the standard astronomical convention in which north has a position angle of zero and angles increase to the east ( g06 ) ; data from schommer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) are plotted as open circles , present data are plotted as star symbols and data from g06 is given by solid points .",
    "over - plotted on this figure ( dashed line ) is the rotation curve solution number 3 from schommer et al .",
    "derived velocities for the present eight target clusters show that their motions are consistent with the findings of schommer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) in that the lmc cluster system exhibits disk - like kinematics that are very similar to the hi disk and has no obvious signature of a stellar halo .",
    "carrera ( 2008 ) argued that failure to find evidence of a hot stellar halo is related to a low contrast of the halo population with respect to that of the disk , even at the large galactocentric radius of their outermost field .",
    "curiously , both old , metal - poor clusters as well as intermediate age , metal - rich clusters share the same disk rotation .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the properties of cmds , age , metallicity and radial velocities of eight lmc massive clusters .",
    "several of these clusters have no modern metallicity determination ; out of eight , four have a spectroscopically determined metallicity value given in o91 with a larger error .",
    "we have used on - average 10 cluster members to determine the mean metallicity which shows a scatter of only 0.05 - 0.12 dex . to derive the metallicity , we obtained medium - resolution spectra at the near - infrared cat using the fors2 multiobject spectrograph at the 8.2-meter vlt / ut1 with high signal - to - noise ( @xmath14 ) and then used the empirically developed , simply calibrated method which can make an efficient estimate of metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) for individual rgb stars using the strength of the cat lines .",
    "we also studied in detail the cmds of all eight clusters based on photometric data taken from fors2 + vlt under excellent atmospheric conditions ( seeing @xmath17 0.7 arcsec ) and determined their ages , making use of existing deep hst data for several of the more crowded fields .",
    "the strong cat lines are also used to determine the radial velocity of each target .",
    "we have used the derived age , metallicity and radial velocities of all eight clusters to study the age metallicity distribution , their relationship and significance , their distribution in the lmc and the kinematics of the lmc .",
    "we have confirmed the efficiency and efficacy of the cat method in deriving [ fe / h ] with much less scatter than previous studies , yielding more conclusive results .",
    "these data can further be used to calibrate the rgb slope - metallicity - age relation based on our homogeneous spectroscopic and infrared data .",
    "the main results of this paper are as follows :    * we have studied the cmds and reported the age of all eight clusters .",
    "six have ages between 0.8 - 2.2 gyr and the other two , ie . ngc 1754 and ngc 1786 , are very old .",
    "* we have derived a spectroscopically determined metallicity for all eight clusters , with comparatively less scatter than previous studies using the cat method .",
    "out of eight , four have no previously spectroscopically determined metallicity value and the rest have large errors in their previously determined values .",
    "the cluster hodge 2 has no previously reported metallicity value . *",
    "the metallicity of the six intermediate age clusters , having a mean age 1.5 gyr , is @xmath1 with a scatter of 0.04 , in excellent agreement with the previous finding of g06 , which shows a very tight distribution with mean metallicity of @xmath1 ( @xmath118 = 0.09 ) .",
    "similarly , mucciarelli et al . (",
    "2008 ) used high resolution spectra of the giants in 4 lmc globular clusters and found a mean [ fe / h ] = @xmath120 .",
    "this agrees well with the theoretical work of bekki et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , which indicates that a close encounter between the lmc and smc caused not only the restart of cluster formation in the lmc but the generation of the central bar ( mean [ fe / h ] = @xmath121 ; c05 ) . *",
    "we find that there is no evidence of a metallicity gradient in the lmc , in contrast with the stellar populations of the mw and m33 , which show that the metallicity decreases as galactocentric distance increases .",
    "the lmc s stellar bar may be the responsible factor for the dilution of any kind of gradient in the lmc .",
    "this result is in good agreement with previous work done by g06 .",
    "* we find that our derived cluster velocities are in good agreement with the results of schommer et al .",
