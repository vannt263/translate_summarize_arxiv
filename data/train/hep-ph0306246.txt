    "the infrared renormalon approach is the popular model for simulating the behavior of the high - twist corrections in the @xmath2-scheme ( see the reviews of refs.@xcite an the recent application of ref.@xcite ) . in particular , in ref.@xcite the prediction for the @xmath3-shape of the twist-4 contributions to the non - singlet ( ns ) structure function ( sf ) @xmath4 and the ns parts of sfs @xmath0 and @xmath1 were obtained .",
    "it should be stressed , that the qualitative validity of the irr model for twist-4 term of @xmath4 sf from ref .",
    "@xcite was confirmed during the nlo fits of refs.@xcite ( for the brief discussions see the talks of ref.@xcite ) . in this report",
    "we will use the machinery of the irr model to find definite relations , induced by the irr model predictions of ref.@xcite for the @xmath5 corrections to the ns parts of @xmath0 and @xmath1 sfs ( see ref.@xcite ) and for the bjorken sum rules ( both polarized and unpolarized @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider the expression for the asymmetry of photon - nucleon polarized dis , which in general has the following form @xmath6 where @xmath7 and the second term in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( 1 ) is the dynamical @xmath5 correction .",
    "it should be stressed , that the recent results of the fits to combined cern , desy and slac polarized dis data in the kinematic region @xmath8 and @xmath9 demonstrated , that the @xmath3-shape of @xmath10 is consistent with zero @xcite .",
    "this effect is leading to the conclusion that @xmath11 using now the well - known inequality @xmath12 we get @xcite , that @xmath13 it should be stressed that the irr model considerations of ref.@xcite predict that in the ns approximation @xmath14 and @xmath15 have the same form , namely @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the calculated in ref.@xcite irr model coefficient function and @xmath18 are the ns parton densities , @xmath19 is the normalization point of order @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the irr model parameter , which should be extracted from the fits of concrete data .",
    "it should be noted that the identity of eq .",
    "( [ f_1 ] ) does not contradict point of view that to study the @xmath22 behavior of @xmath23 in the ns approximation it might be convenient to use the concrete @xmath4 data instead of theoretical expression for @xmath1 @xcite .    in the case of ns approximation for the @xmath0",
    "sf the irr result of ref.@xcite has the following form @xmath24 where the irr model coefficient function has the same expression as in the case of the irr model predictions for @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the ns polarized parton densities .",
    "combining now the ns expressions for @xmath25 and @xmath27 we arrive to the main result of the work of ref.@xcite , namely @xmath28 which is valid both at the lo and nlo . in the case of @xmath29 assumed in ref.@xcite , this inequality is similar to the lo bound of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely @xmath30",
