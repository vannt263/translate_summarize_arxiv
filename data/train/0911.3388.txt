    "a particle suspended in a fluid , moving in the vicinity of a stationary wall , feels a viscous drag force which is larger than the viscous drag it would experience in the bulk fluid @xcite .",
    "this may intuitively be understood by considering the special case of a particle moving towards ( away from ) a wall : fluid needs to be squeezed out ( sucked into ) the gap between the particle and the wall . even when the particle is relatively far away from the wall the hindering effects of the wall are still felt through the long - ranged hydrodynamic inteactions .",
    "this has important consequences for practical applications where flow and time are issues . especially for microfluidic applications @xcite , where large surface to volume ratios are encountered",
    ", it is important to understand the fundamentals of near - wall dynamics .",
    "when dealing with colloidal particles random forces should also be taken into account @xcite .",
    "the random forces are caused by temporary imbalances in the collisions with the solvent molecules , and lead to diffusive ( brownian ) motion of the colloidal particles .",
    "the diffusive behaviour of nanometer to micrometer sized particles near walls is essential for the transient kinetics of phenomena such as wetting and particle deposition on a substrate @xcite .",
    "the ( anisotropic ) diffusion tensor @xmath6 of a colloidal particle is related to the anisotropic friction tensor @xmath7 by the generalised einstein relation @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the thermal energy .",
    "the friction tensor in the presence of a stick boundary wall is difficult to obtain theoretically .",
    "analytical expressions in the creeping flow limit ( applicable to colloidal particles ) are known , but are limited to the case of a spherical particle @xcite or to a non - spherical particle whose major ( hydrodynamic ) axes are aligned with the wall and which is far removed from the wall @xcite . in the general case ,",
    "particles are not aligned with the wall and/or may not be far removed from it .",
    "one then has to resort to experiment or numerical evaluation to obtain the friction or diffusion tensor .    experimentally , optical microscopy @xcite , total internal reflection microscopy ( tirm ) @xcite , and evanescent wave dynamic light scattering ( ewdls ) @xcite have been used to determine the diffusivity of particles near a wall .",
    "the latter two experimental techniques use the short penetration depth of an evanescent wave under total internal reflection conditions , where in ewdls this is combined with dynamic light scattering . in ewdls the different components of the diffusion tensor may be obtained from the intensity time - autocorrelation , but this requires several careful theoretical interpretations @xcite .",
    "numerical evaluation of the friction on a particle can be performed in several ways : by numerical summation of the forces due to a large number of stokeslets distributed over the walls and surfaces of the particles @xcite , possibly including image singularities to efficiently capture the effect of a planar wall @xcite , or by a multipole expansion of the force densities induced on the spheres , also with an image representation to account for a planar wall @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will present an alternative way to determine the friction on a colloidal particle , using molecular dynamics simulations which explicitly include the solvent particles . because of the large difference in length scales between a colloidal particle and a solvent molecule , it is impossible to perform such simulations in full atomistic detail .",
    "some form of coarse - graining is necessary .",
    "here we choose the stochastic rotation dynamics ( srd ) method to effectively represent the solvent @xcite .",
    "the solvent interacts with walls and colloidal particles through excluded volume interactions @xcite . using this approach",
    ", we determine the friction on a shish - kebab model of a rod of aspect ratio 10 , i.e. 10 touching spheres on a straight line , as a function of distance to and angle ( @xmath4 ) with a planar wall .",
    "we will show that the functional dependence of the wall - induced friction enhancement can be reasonably well described by the inverse of the closest distance @xmath1 between rod surface and the wall ( for @xmath1 in the range between one eighth the rod diameter and the rod length ) , and an angular dependence which may be expressed as a simple polynomial in @xmath5 .",
    "these results serve as a first example to show how srd simulations may be used to determine the friction on particles of non - trivial shape in a non - trivial orientation with respect to confining boundaries .",
    "stokesian dynamics codes , such as those developed by brady and co - workers @xcite and cichocki and co - workers @xcite , have other sophisticated methods to determine the friction tensor .",
    "the results from such methods are generally more precise ( if sufficient care is taken in its implementation and choice of parameters ) than those from srd simulations , because in srd the solvent dynamics is stochastic and the resolution seems to be limited by the collision cell size . however , as we will show , in practice the resolution is better than a collision cell size , and the influence of stochasticy can be severely reduced by taking long time averages , leading to an acceptable precision for making predictions .",
    "the biggest advantage of srd over stokesian dynamics is the extreme simplicity of the implementation of the srd method when non - trivial shapes and complex confining boundaries are involved . in stokesian dynamics methods",
    "one has to deal with complicated multipole expansions and image representations .",
    "if the embedded particle shape is non - trivial , or if the confining boundaries are not planar but more complex , they have to be represented by assemblies of different sized spheres . in contrast , in srd , being essentially a molecular dynamics technique with a simple additional rule for momentum exchange , all that is needed is a rule to determine when a solvent point particle overlaps with the embedded particle or wall .",
    "the srd method then automatically takes care of all hydrodynamic interactions between complex shapes .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec_method ]",
    "we give details of the simulations method and the constraint technique by which we determine the hydrodynamic friction . in section [ sec_sphere ]",
    "we validate the method by comparing simulations of a sphere near a planar wall with known analytical expressions .",

    "stochastic stick boundaries are implemented as described in ref .",
    "in short , srd particles which overlap with a wall or sphere are bounced back into the solvent with tangential and normal velocities from a thermal distribution .",
    "the change of momentum is used to calculate the force on the boundary .",
    "we note that despite the fact that the boundaries are taken into account through stochastic collision rules , the _ average _ effect is that of a classical stick boundary as often employed in ( stokesian ) continuum mechanics . because we will determine frictions by taking long time averages",
    ", the average flow velocities close to the boundaries will be effectively zero in all directions . in this work we set the sphere diameter to @xmath26 , which is sufficiently large to accurately resolve the hydrodynamic field to distances as small as @xmath27 , as already shown in refs .",

    "the method will be validated here again by comparing the friction between a sphere and a wall with known expressions from hydrodynamic theory .",
    "walls are present at @xmath28 and @xmath29 , i.e. the wall normal @xmath30 is in the @xmath31-direction .",
    "simulations containing a single sphere are performed in a box of dimensions @xmath32 , corresponding to @xmath33 in each direction .",
    "simulations containing a rod with its longest axis along @xmath30 are performed in a box of @xmath34 .",

    "note that the finite box dimensions imply that there will still be an important self - interaction of the rod with its periodic images .",
    "larger boxes are computationally too expensive . in this work",
    "we will assume that the dependence of the hydrodynamic friction on angle and distance to the wall is dominated by the presence of the wall itself and that self - interactions with periodic images lead to a simple overall multiplication factor of the friction .",
    "all simulations were run for a time of @xmath37 , i.e. 5 million collision time steps . in cpu time",
    "this corresponds to about 4 weeks on a modern single core processor .",
    "such long run times are necessary to attain sufficient accuracy in the determination of the friction , the method of which is explained in the following paragraph .",
    "the translational friction tensor @xmath7 transforms the translational velocity @xmath38 of the centre - of - mass of an object to the friction force @xmath39 it experiences .",
    "similarly , the rotational friction tensor @xmath40 transforms the rotational velocity @xmath41 around the centre - of - mass to the friction torque @xmath42 . in formula : @xmath43 in our simulations , the translational friction tensor is determined without actually moving the rod by measuring the time correlation of the constraint force @xmath44 needed to keep the rod at a fixed position @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and the subscript to the pointy brackets indicates an average over many time origins @xmath47 .",
    "similarly , the rotational friction tensor is determined from the time correlation of the constraint torque @xmath48 needed to keep the rod at a fixed orientation : @xmath49    it is important to realise that there are two sources of friction on a large particle @xcite .",
    "the first comes from the hydrodynamic dissipation in the fluid induced by motion of the particle and may be obtained by solving stokes equation , integrating the solvent stress over the surface of the particle . for translation of a sphere of diameter @xmath50 in an infinite fluid",
    "this yields the familiar ( isotropic ) friction @xmath51 .",
    "the second contribution is the enskog friction @xcite , which is the friction that a large particle would experience if it were dragged through a non - hydrodynamic ideal gas , _",
    "i.e. _ through a gas where the velocities of the particles are uncorrelated in space and time and distributed according to the maxwell - boltzmann law . for a heavy sphere with diffusing boundaries ( which randomly scatter colliding particles according to the maxwell - boltzmann law ) the translational enskog friction",
    "is given by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the gyration ratio .",
    "it has been confirmed @xcite that the two sources of friction act in parallel , _",
    "i.e. _ that the total friction @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 for simplicity a scalar friction is shown here , but these results apply equally well to each component of the friction tensor .",
    "the parallel addition may be rationalised as follows .",
    "when a large particle is forced to move through a sea of smaller particles , it can dissipate energy through two parallel channels : 1 ) by dragging itself through this sea of small particles , resulting in more large - small collisions , or 2 ) by setting up a flow field in the solvent , at the expense of viscous dissipation in the solvent but with the advantage that the sea of gas particles is co - moving near its surface , resulting in less large - small collisions .    in a real ( experimental ) colloidal suspension",
    "both the solvent density and the range of the colloid - solvent interaction are larger than simulated here , which is why at any given time many more solvent molecules are interacting with each colloid .",
    "this leads to an enskog friction which is orders of magnitude larger than the hydrodynamic friction ( it is important to note that for a hard sphere in a point particle fluid the enskog friction increases faster than the hydrodynamic friction with increasing sphere diameter , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) .",
    "hence for real mesoscopic particles the total friction @xmath54 is practically equal to the hydrodynamic friction @xmath58 . in our simulations",
    "the enskog friction on one sphere is only approximately 4 times larger than the hydrodynamic friction @xcite .    in our simulations",
    ", we can easily determine the enskog friction .",
    "in many ways the hard - colloid and srd fluid system is like a hard sphere system , in which case the general structural features of the force autocorrelation ( or time dependent friction ) are ( a ) an initial delta function contribution whose integral is the enskog friction and ( b ) a slower contribution associated with correlated collisions and collective effects , which is negative for low and intermediate particle densities @xcite .",
    "the enskog friction can therefore be read off as the peak value in the running integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq_fricintegral ] ) , @xmath59 , at very short times @xmath60 .",
    "note that for continuous interactions there is no clear - cut separation as described here @xcite . applying the above procedure to the case of a sphere",

    "reasonably good fits of both the translational and rotational friction could be made with the inverse of the closest distance @xmath1 between the rod and wall , at least in the range @xmath168 $ ] .",
    "we have found that for a noticeable friction increase the closest distance between rod and wall needs to be on the order of the rod diameter . also , in agreement with common sense , the friction increase is strongest when the rod lies parallel to the wall ( @xmath169 ) . for translations ,",
    "the friction component @xmath113 is the largest , as this corresponds ( at least partially ) to motion to and from the wall . for rotations ,",
    "the friction component @xmath146 is the largest , as this corresponds to motion to and from the wall of the extremities of the rod .    in anticipation of an accurate theoretical treatment of this system , we have fitted the angular dependence of the friction components and found good fits in most cases with @xmath170 .",
    "we do not have a motivation for this functional form except that , intuitively , the friction increase must be relatively larger when a larger area of the rod is exposed close to the wall",
    ". hence an increasing function of angle @xmath4 is expected .",
    "the only exception seems to be the angular dependence of the parallel translational friction @xmath111 , for which the smallest friction increase occurs at an intermediate angle of 60 degrees ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ transprefactorscaling ] ) . because we can not give a full physical motivation , the scalings we have presented here are possibly not exact .",
    "however , they do serve to represent our measurements in a compact form which may be useful for future simulations .",
    "such simulations are planned for the near future .",
    "more generally , the technique presented in this paper offers the posibility to determine with reasonable precision the hydrodynamic frictions on complex objects , possibly with nearby complex boundaries , under circumstances where theoretical calculations are too difficult to be performed .",
