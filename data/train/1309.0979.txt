    "in this paper all graphs are simple . we give a structural characterization of graphs that do not contain a cycle with a unique chord as an induced subgraph .",
    "for the sake of conciseness we call @xmath0 this class of graph . our main result , theorem  [ th:1 ] , states that every connected graph in @xmath0 is either in some simple basic class or has a particular decomposition .",
    "basic classes are chordless cycles , cliques , bipartite graphs with one side containing only nodes of degree two and graphs that are isomorphic to an induced subgraph of the famous heawood or petersen graph .",
    "our decompositions are node cutsets consisting of one or two nodes or an edge cutset called a 1-join .",
    "the definitions and the precise statement are given in section  [ s : main ] .",
    "the proof is given in section  [ s : proof ] . both petersen and heawood graphs were discovered at the end of the xixth century in the research on the four color conjecture , see  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to us to have them both as sporadic basic graphs .",
    "note that our theorem works in two directions : a graph is in  @xmath0 if and only if it can be constructed by gluing basic graphs along our decompositions ( this is proved in section  [ sec : st ] ) .",
    "such structure theorems are stronger than the usual decomposition theorems and there are not so many of them ( see @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "this is our first motivation .    ' '' ''    our structural characterization allows us to prove properties of classical invariants .",
    "we prove in section  [ s : bounding ] that every graph @xmath6 in  @xmath0 satisfies either @xmath7 or @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 denotes the chromatic number and @xmath10 denotes the size of a maximum clique ) .",
    "this is a strengthening of the classical vizing bound @xmath11 .",
    "so this class of graphs belongs to the family of @xmath12-bounded graphs , introduced by gyrfs @xcite as a natural extension of perfect graphs : a family of graphs @xmath13 is _ @xmath12-bounded _ with _",
    "@xmath12-binding function _",
    "@xmath14 if , for every induced subgraph @xmath15 of @xmath16 , @xmath17 . a natural question to ask",
    "is : what choices of forbidden induced subgraphs guarantee that a family of graphs is @xmath12-bounded ?",
    "much research has been done in this area , for a survey see @xcite .",
    "we note that most of that research has been done on classes of graphs obtained by forbidding a finite number of graphs .",
    "since there are graphs with arbitrarily large chromatic number and girth @xcite , in order for a family of graphs defined by forbidding a finite number of graphs ( as induced subgraphs ) to be @xmath12-bounded , at least one of these forbidden graphs needs to be acyclic .",
    "vizing s theorem @xcite states that for a simple graph @xmath6 , @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 denotes the maximum vertex degree of @xmath6 , and @xmath20 denotes the chromatic index of @xmath6 , i.e. the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges of @xmath6 so that no two adjacent edges receive the same color ) .",
    "this implies that the class of line graphs of simple graphs is a @xmath12-bounded family with @xmath12-binding function @xmath21 .",
    "this special upper bound for the chromatic number is called the _",
    "vizing bound_. we obtain the vizing bound for the chromatic number by forbidding a family of graphs none of which is acyclic .",
    "our result is algorithmic : we provide an @xmath3 algorithm that computes an optimal coloring of every graph in  @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to see that there exists an @xmath4 algorithm that computes a maximum clique for every graph in  @xmath0 ; and it follows from a construction of poljak  @xcite that finding a maximum stable set of a graph in  @xmath0 is np - hard ( see section  [ s : cliquestable ] ) .",
    "all this is our second motivation .    ' '' ''    a third motivation is the detection of induced subgraphs .",
    "subdivisible graph _",
    "( _ s - graph _ for short ) is a triple @xmath22 such that @xmath23 is a graph and @xmath24 .",
    "the edges in @xmath25 are said to be _",
    "real edges of @xmath26 _ while the edges in @xmath27 are said to be _ subdivisible edges of @xmath26_. a _ realisation _ of @xmath26 is a graph obtained from @xmath26 by subdividing edges of @xmath27 into paths of arbitrary length ( at least one ) .",
    "the problem @xmath28 is the decision problem whose input is a graph @xmath6 and whose question is \" does @xmath6 contain a realisation of @xmath26 as an induced subgraph ?  . in the discussion below , by `` detection problem '' , we mean `` problem @xmath28 for some fixed s - graph @xmath26 '' .",
    "this is restrictive since a lot of detection problems of great interest ( such as the detection of odd holes , where a _ hole _ is an induced cycle of length at least four ) are not of that kind .",
    "let @xmath29 be the s - graph on nodes @xmath30 with real edges @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and subdivisible edges @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "we also define for @xmath36 the s - graph @xmath37 obtained from @xmath29 by subdividing the edge @xmath31 into a path of length @xmath38 and the edge @xmath32 into a path of length @xmath39 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ f : sgraph ] where real edges are represented as straight lines and subdivisible edges as dashed lines .",
    "the question in problem @xmath40 can be rephrased as `` does @xmath6 contain a cycle with a unique chord ? ''",
    "or `` is @xmath6 not in  @xmath0 ? '' .",
    "the existence of a polynomial time algorithm was an open question .",
    "a consequence of our structural description of  @xmath0 is an @xmath3-time algorithm for @xmath40 ( see section  [ sec : decomp ] ) .",

    "a general criterion on an s - graph that decides whether the related decision problem is np - complete or polynomial would be of interest .",
    "our solution of @xmath40 gives some insight in the quest for such a criterion .",
    "a very powerful tool for solving detection problems is the algorithm three - in - a - tree of chudnovsky and seymour ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this algorithm decides in time @xmath46 whether three given nodes of a given graph @xmath6 are in an induced tree of @xmath6 . in  @xcite and  @xcite it",
    "is observed that every detection problem @xmath28 for which a polynomial time algorithm is known can be solved easily by a brute force enumeration or by using three - in - a - tree .",
    "but as far as we can see , three - in - a - tree can not be used to solve @xmath40 , so our solution of @xmath40 yields the first example of a detection problem that does not fall under the scope of three - in - a - tree .",
    "is there a good reason for that ?",
    "we claim that a polynomial time algorithm for @xmath40 exists thanks to what we call _",
    "degeneracy_. let us explain this .",
    "every statement that we give from here on to the end of the section is under the assumption that p@xmath47np .",
    "degeneracy has to deal with the following question : does putting bounds on the lengths of the paths in realisations of an s - graph affect the complexity of the related detection problem ? for upper bounds , the answer can be found in previous research .",
    "first , putting upper bounds may turn the complexity from np - complete to polynomial .",
    "this follows from a simple observation : let @xmath26 be any s - graph .",
    "a realisation of @xmath26 , where the lengths of the paths arising from the subdivisions of subdivisible edges are bounded by an integer @xmath48 , has a number of nodes bounded by a fixed integer @xmath49 ( that depends only on @xmath48 and the size of @xmath26 ) .",
    "so , such a realisation can be detected in time @xmath50 by a brute force enumeration .",
    "but surprisingly , putting upper bounds in another way may also turn the complexity from polynomial to np - complete : in @xcite , a polynomial time algorithm for @xmath51 is given , while in @xcite it is proved that @xmath52 is np - complete , where @xmath53 are the s - graphs represented in figure  [ f : pp ] .",
    "note that @xmath51 is usually called the pyramid ( or 3pc(@xmath54 ) ) detection problem .",
    "ccc , title=\"fig : \" ] &    ' '' ''    & , title=\"fig : \" ] + @xmath55 & & @xmath56    can putting lower bounds turn the complexity from polynomial to np - complete ?",
    "our recognition algorithm for @xmath0 shows that the answer is yes since in section  [ s : bounds ] we also prove that the problem @xmath57 is np - complete .",
    "a realisation of @xmath45 is simply a realisation of @xmath29 where every subdivisible edge is subdivided into a path of length at least three .",
    "we believe that a satisfactory structural description of the class  @xmath58 of graphs that do not contain a realisation of @xmath45 is hopeless because @xmath57 is np - complete .",
    "so why is there a decomposition theorem for  @xmath0  ?",
    "simply because degenerate small graphs like the _ diamond _ ( that is the cycle on four nodes with exactly one chord ) are forbidden in  @xmath0 , not in  @xmath58 , and this helps a lot in our proof of theorem  [ th:1 ] ( the decomposition theorem for @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is what we call the _ degeneracy _ of the class  @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that degeneracy can help in solving detection problems , and our results give a first example of this phenomenon .",
    "so the last question is : can putting lower bounds turn the complexity from np - complete to polynomial ?",
    "we do not know the answer . also , we were not able to solve the following questions : what is the complexity of the problems @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and  @xmath62 ? the related classes of graphs are not degenerate enough to allow us to decompose , and they are too degenerate to allow us to find an np - completeness proof .    ' '' ''    a fourth motivation is that our class @xmath2 is related to well studied classes .",
    "it is a generalization of strongly balanceable graphs , see @xcite for a survey .",
    "a bipartite graph is _ balanceable _ if there exists a signing of its edges with @xmath63 and @xmath64 so that the weight of every hole is a multiple of  4 .",
    "a bipartite graph is _ strongly balanceable _ if it is balanceable and it does not contain a cycle with a unique chord .",
    "there is an excluded induced subgraph characterization of balanceable bipartite graphs due to truemper @xcite .",
    "a _ wheel _ in a graph consists of a hole @xmath65 and a node @xmath66 that has at least three neighbors in @xmath65 , and the wheel is _ odd _ if @xmath66 has an odd number of neighbors in @xmath65 . in a bipartite graph @xmath6 , a _ 3-odd - path configuration _",
    "consists of two nonadjacent nodes @xmath67 and @xmath66 that are on opposite sides of the bipartition of @xmath6 , together with three internally node - disjoint @xmath68-paths , such that there are no other edges in @xmath6 among the nodes of the three paths .",
    "a bipartite graph is balanceable if and only if it does not contain an odd wheel nor a 3-odd - path configuration @xcite .",
    "so a bipartite graph is strongly balanceable if and only if it does not contain a 3-odd - path configuration nor a cycle with a unique chord .",
    "a bipartite graph is _ restricted balanceable _ if there exists a signing of its edges with @xmath63 and @xmath64 so that the weight of every cycle is a multiple of  4 .",
    "conforti and rao @xcite show that a strongly balanceable graph is either restricted balanceable or has a 1-join , which enables them to recognize the class of strongly balanceable graphs ( they decompose along 1-joins , and then directly recognize restricted balanceable graphs ) .",
    "a bipartite graph is _",
    "2-bipartite _ if all the nodes in one side of the bipartition have degree at most 2 .",
    "yannakakis @xcite shows that a restricted balanceable graph is either 2-bipartite or has a 1-cutset or a 2-join consisting of two edges ( this is an edge cutset that consists of two edges that have no common endnode ) , and hence obtains a linear time recognition algorithm for restricted balanceable graphs .",
    "we note that the basic graphs from our decomposition theorem that do not have any of our cutsets , and are balanceable , are in fact 2-bipartite .",
    "class @xmath2 is contained in another well studied class of graphs , the _ cap - free _ graphs ( where a cap is a graph that consists of a hole and a node that has exactly two neighbors on this hole , and these two neighbors are adjacent )  @xcite . in  @xcite cap - free graphs are decomposed with 1-amalgams ( a generalization of a 1-join ) into triangulated graphs and biconnected triangle - free graphs together with at most one additional node that is adjacent to all other nodes of the graph .",
    "this decomposition theorem is then used to recognize strongly even - signable and strongly odd - signable graphs in polynomial time , where a graph is _ strongly even - signable _ if its edges can be signed with  0 and  1 so that every cycle of length @xmath69 with at most one chord has even weight and every triangle has odd weight , and a graph is _ strongly odd - signable _ if its edges can be signed with 0 and 1 so that cycles of length 4 with one chord are of even weight and all other cycles with at most one chord are of odd weight .",

    "implying that @xmath924 .",
    "so it only remains to show that @xmath72 contains a node of every odd cycle of @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath65 be an odd cycle of @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath929 , then since @xmath788 is a third color of @xmath572 , @xmath788 contains a node of @xmath65 , and hence so does @xmath72 .",
    "if @xmath930 , then since @xmath789 is a third color of @xmath573 , @xmath789 contains a node of @xmath65 , and hence so does @xmath72 .",
    "so we may assume that @xmath65 contains both a node of @xmath106 and a node of @xmath107 .",
    "hence , @xmath65 is node - wise partitioned into a path of @xmath106 and a path of @xmath107 of different parity .",
    "hence if we suppose that @xmath65 is minimal with respect to the property of overlapping @xmath931 and being odd , then either @xmath932 or @xmath933 .",
    "suppose that @xmath934 .",
    "then @xmath935 induces an odd cycle @xmath936 of @xmath573 .",
    "since @xmath789 is a third color of @xmath573 , @xmath789 contains a node @xmath853 of @xmath936 . since @xmath914",
    ", @xmath853 is a node of @xmath937 .",
    "finally assume that @xmath938 .",
    "then @xmath939 induces an odd cycle @xmath936 of @xmath572 .",
    "since @xmath788 is a third color of @xmath572 , @xmath788 contains a node @xmath853 of @xmath936 . if @xmath940 then @xmath853 is a node of @xmath941 .",
    "so assume @xmath942",
    ". then @xmath943 and hence @xmath944 , and in particular @xmath945 .    our proof of lemmas  [ th : tcsp ] , [ th : thirdcolor ] suggests that for every triangle - free graph in @xmath0 there might exist a stable set that intersects every cycle .",
    "such a property might be of use for stronger notions of coloring ( list coloring ,  ) .",
    "it holds for every basic graph ( even for the petersen graph ) , for every square - and - petersen - free graph by a slight variant of lemma  [ th : tcsp ] and we almost proved it in general .",
    "but it is false .",
    "let us build a counter - example @xmath6 , obtained from four disjoint copies @xmath946 of the petersen graph minus one node .",
    "so @xmath947 contains a set  @xmath948 of three nodes of degree two ( @xmath949 ) .",
    "we add all edges between @xmath950 , between @xmath951 , between @xmath952 and between @xmath953 .",
    "note that @xmath6 can be obtained by gluing one square @xmath954 and four disjoint copies @xmath955 of the petersen graph along operation  @xmath607 of theorem  [ th : structure ] as follows : let @xmath956 and for @xmath957 to @xmath958 , replace @xmath6 by itself glued through @xmath959 with @xmath947 .",
    "so @xmath584 by theorem  [ th : structure ] .",
    "we claim now that @xmath6 does not contain a stable set that intersects every cycle .",
    "indeed , if @xmath72 is such a stable set then @xmath72 must contain all nodes in one of the @xmath948 s for otherwise we build a @xmath566 of @xmath718 by choosing a node in every  @xmath948 . so @xmath960 say . we suppose that @xmath961 has nodes @xmath962 with our usual notation .",
    "so @xmath963 and we observe that every node in @xmath964 has a neighbor in @xmath965 . hence @xmath966 while @xmath967 $ ] is a cycle on six nodes , a contradiction .",
    "note that for any node @xmath66 of @xmath6 , @xmath968 contains a stable set that intersects every cycle .",
    "so , a characterisation by forbidding induced subgraphs of the class of graphs that admit a stable set intersecting every cycle needs to consider @xmath6 somehow .",
    "for this reason , we believe that such a characterisation must be complicated .    if @xmath587 , then either @xmath7 or @xmath8 . in particular , @xmath969 .",
    "clearly we may assume that @xmath6 is connected . if @xmath970 then @xmath8 since @xmath6 contains a third color by lemma  [ th : tcbasic ] , [ th : tcpetersen ] or  [ th : thirdcolor ] ( indeed , every non - empty graph has an admissible pair : @xmath971,\\emptyset ) $ ] ) .",
    "if @xmath972 then by theorem  [ th : triangle ] , @xmath6 admits a 1-cutset .",
    "so every 2-connected component of @xmath6 is either a clique or is 3-colorable .",
    "hence @xmath7 .",
    "there exists an algorithm that computes an optimal coloring of any graph in @xmath0 in time @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath6 be a graph in @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath6 has a 1-cutset , then it is easy to obtain an optimal coloring of @xmath6 from optimal colorings of its blocks .",
    "so by theorem  [ th : triangle ] we may assume that our input graph is triangle - free .",
    "we may also assume that @xmath6 is connected and not bipartite .",
    "now we show how to 3-color @xmath6 by finding a third color of @xmath6 .",
    "we first construct a proper decomposition tree @xmath699 of the input graph @xmath6 in time @xmath3 , by theorem  [ dtalg ] .",
    "let @xmath66 be any node of @xmath6 .",
    "we associate with node @xmath6 of @xmath699 an admissible pair @xmath731 , say @xmath973 $ ] and @xmath974 , and we use lemmas [ th : tcbasic ] , [ th : tcpetersen ] , [ th : tcsp ] and [ th : thirdcolor ] to recursively find a third color @xmath72 of @xmath6 such that @xmath734 and @xmath783 .",
    "first note that all the leaves of @xmath699 are basic , and since @xmath6 is triangle - free , they are one of the graphs described in lemma  [ th : tcbasic ] or [ th : tcpetersen ] .",
    "so once the appropriate admissible pairs have been associated with a given leaf of @xmath699 , lemma  [ th : tcbasic ] or [ th : tcpetersen ] shows how to find the appropriate third color ( or if needed , strong third colors ) , each in linear time in the size of the leaf .    for a non - leaf node @xmath65 of type  1 of @xmath699 , lemma  [",
    "th : thirdcolor ] shows how to proceed ( in linear time ) to find a third color of @xmath65 by asking recursively for appropriately chosen third colors of its children ( i.e. choosing appropriate admissible pairs to associate with its children , and once the appropriate third colors of its children are found how to put them together to find the desired third color of @xmath65 ) .",
    "note that in several cases , the algorithm has to compute the third colors of the children @xmath975 of @xmath65 in a prescribed order , that is wait for the answer for the coloring of @xmath976 before knowing what admissible pair is needed for the coloring of @xmath977 .    for a non - leaf node @xmath65 of type  2 of @xmath699 , to recursively find a third color of @xmath65 , we actually need to find a strong third color .",
    "this we can do by proceeding as in the proofs of lemma [ th : tcsp ] . note that since @xmath65 is of type  2 , every non - leaf descendant of @xmath65 is of type  2 .",
    "also , no descendant of @xmath65 contains the petersen graph , so all leaves under @xmath65 will have a strong third color computed by lemma  [ th : tcbasic ] .",
    "so the processing time at each non - leaf node of @xmath699 is @xmath978 .",
    "since by lemma  [ l : sizet ] the size of @xmath699 is @xmath712 , the sum of processing times at the leaves of @xmath699 is @xmath716 .",
    "so the time needed to process the tree is @xmath4 .",
    "hence , the total computation time is @xmath625 .",
    "we note that the algorithm above has complexity @xmath4 once the proper decomposition tree is given .",
    "so , if one can find an @xmath629-time algorithm for constructing a proper decomposition tree , then one gets an @xmath4-time coloring algorithm for graphs in @xmath0 .",
    "the problems of finding a maximum clique and a maximum stable set for a graph in @xmath0 have a complexity that is easy to establish .",
    "note first that any graph in @xmath0 contains no diamond .",
    "so any edge of a graph in @xmath0 is contained in a unique maximal clique . hence , to find a maximum clique in polynomial time ,",
    "it is enough to look for the common neighborhood of every edge .",
    "a simple implementation of this leads to an @xmath3-time algorithm and no faster algorithm seems to be known for diamond - free graphs . here below we give a linear time algorithm restricted to our class @xmath2 .",
    "note in contrast that , as proved by maffray and preissmann , the coloring problem is np - hard even when restricted to triangle - free graphs  @xcite .",
    "there exists a linear time algorithm whose input is a graph in @xmath1 and whose output is a maximum clique of @xmath6 .",
    "it is trivial to decide in linear time whether @xmath979 .",
    "so , we assume @xmath980",
    ". then the 2-connected components of @xmath6 can be found in linear time ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) . by theorem",
    "[ th : triangle ] , every 2-connected component is either a clique or is triangle - free .",
    "so , to find a maximum clique it suffices for each 2-connected component to test whether it is a clique or not , and to output a largest such clique ( if any ) .",
    "if no 2-connected component is a clique then output any edge .",
    "2-subdivision _ is a graph obtained from any graph by subdividing twice every edge .",
    "more precisely , every edge @xmath68 of a graph @xmath6 is replaced by an induced path @xmath981 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are of degree two .",
    "let @xmath27 be the resulting graph .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath982 .",
    "this construction , due to poljak , easily yields :    the problem whose instance is a 2-subdivision @xmath6 and an integer @xmath38 and whose question is `` does @xmath6 contain a stable set of size at least @xmath38 '' is np - complete .",
    "since every 2-subdivision is in @xmath0 , a direct consequence is :    finding a maximum stable set of a graph in @xmath0 is np - hard .",
    "it is mentioned in section  [ f : sgraph ] that the problem @xmath57 is np - complete . to prove this",
    ", we need a slight variation on a theorem proved in @xcite using a refinement of a construction due to bienstock  @xcite .",
    "we remind the reader that @xmath532 denotes the graph on nodes @xmath533 with the following edges : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath534 , @xmath535 .    for any integer @xmath983",

    "@xmath986 ) .",

    "the question of @xmath984 is `` does there exist an induced cycle of @xmath6 that goes through @xmath579 ? '' .",
    "[ th : linetal ] for all integers @xmath983 the problem @xmath984 is np - complete .",

    "theorem  2.3 states that problem  @xmath174 , that is problem @xmath984 where condition  [ i : lengthk ] is forgoten , is np - complete .",
    "the proof is obtained by a reduction from 3-sat . for every integer @xmath38 and every instance @xmath14 of 3-sat , an instance denoted by @xmath988 of @xmath174 is built .",
    "it is shown that @xmath14 has a truth assignment if and only if @xmath989 contains an induced cycle that goes through @xmath579 .",
    "it turns out that luckily @xmath989 is an instance of @xmath984 ( even if unluckily this is not explicitly stated in  @xcite ) , because @xmath989 satisfies condition  [ i : lengthk ] .",
