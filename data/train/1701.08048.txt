    "carbon - hydrogen plastics are widely used nowadays in various experiments on the interaction of intense energy fluxes with matter .",
    "one of these fruitful applications is described in the paper by povarnitsyn et al.:@xcite a polyethylene film may be used to block the prepulse , and thereby , to improve the contrast of an intense laser pulse .",
    "two types of prepulse are considered:@xcite nanosecond ( intensity @xmath8  w/@xmath9 ; duration @xmath10  ns ) and picosecond ( @xmath11  w/@xmath9 ; @xmath12  ps ) ones .",
    "both prepulses absorbed by the film produce the state of plasma with an electron temperature @xmath6 exceeding an ion temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the conditions with @xmath13 are often called a two - temperature ( @xmath14 ) regime .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath14-state may be explained as follows .",
    "the absorption of laser radiation by electrons assists the creation of the @xmath14-state : the larger laser intensity @xmath15 , the faster @xmath16 grows .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling destroys the @xmath14-state : the larger electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath17 , the faster @xmath16 decreases .",
    "thus if the prepulse intensity @xmath15 is great enough , the @xmath14-state with considerable @xmath16 may be created .",
    "the action of the prepulse may be described quantitatively using numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "modelling @xcite shows , that after a considerable part of the nanosecond prepulse has been absorbed , the following conditions are obtained : relative change of density @xmath18@xmath19 , @xmath20  kk , @xmath21  kk .",
    "a number of matter properties are required to simulate the action of the prepulse .",
    "particularly , an equation of state , a complex dielectric function and a thermal conductivity coefficient should be known .",
    "paper @xcite employs rather rough models of matter properties .",
    "therefore , the need for better knowledge of plasma properties arises .",
    "the matter properties should be known for all the states of the system : from the ambient conditions to the extreme parameters specified above .",
    "the required properties may be calculated via various techniques , including : the average atom model @xcite , the chemical plasma model @xcite and quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) .",
    "none of these methods may yield data for all conditions emerging under the action of the prepulse .",
    "the qmd technique is a powerful tool for the calculation of properties in the warm dense matter regime ( rather high densities and moderate temperatures ) .",
    "qmd is widely used for the calculation of thermodynamic properties , including equation of state @xcite , shock hugoniots @xcite and melting curves @xcite . a common approach to obtain electronic transport and optical properties from a qmd simulation is to use the kubo - greenwood formula ( kg ) . here",
    "the transport properties encompass static electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity , whereas the optical properties include dynamic electrical conductivity , complex dieletric function , complex refraction index and reflectivity .",
    "the qmd+kg technique became particularly widespread after the papers @xcite .",
    "some of the most recent qmd+kg calculations address transport and optical properties of deuterium @xcite , berillium @xcite , xenon @xcite and copper @xcite .",
    "carbon - hydrogen plasma has also been explored by the qmd technique recently .",
    "pure c@xmath22h@xmath23 plasma ( carbon and hydrogen ions are the only ions present in the system ) was considered in papers @xcite .",
    "other works @xcite study the influence of dopants .",
    "transport and optical properties of carbon - hydrogen plasma were investigated in papers @xcite .",
    "some of the cited works are discussed in more detail in our previous work @xcite .",
    "none of the papers mentioned above studies the influence of the @xmath14-state on the properties of carbon - hydrogen plasma .",
    "the lack of such data was the first reason stimulating this work . in this paper",
    "we calculate specific energy and static electrical conductivity of ch@xmath0 plasma in the @xmath14-state via the qmd+kg technique .",
    "the plasma of ch@xmath0 composition corresponds to polyethylene heated by laser radiation . in this work",
    "the properties are calculated at the normal density of polyethylene @xmath2  g/@xmath3 and at temperatures 5  kk  @xmath1  kk . these conditions correspond to the very beginning of the prepulse action ; the temperatures after the prepulse are much larger .",
    "however , the beginning of the prepulse action should be also simulated carefully , since the spacial distribution of plasma at the initial stage influences the whole following process dramatically . thus we have to know the properties of ch@xmath0 plasma even for such moderate temperatures .    properties of ch@xmath0 plasma in the one - temperature ( @xmath24 ) case @xmath25 were investigated in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the properties were calculated at @xmath2  g/@xmath3 and at temperatures 5  kk  @xmath26  kk .",
    "the most interesting results obtained in @xcite concern specific heat capacity and static electrical conductivity of ch@xmath0 plasma .",
    "the specific heat capacity @xmath27 decreases at 5  kk  @xmath28  kk and increases at 15  kk  @xmath29  kk .",
    "the decrease of @xmath27 corresponds to the concave shape of the temperature dependence of specific energy @xmath30 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the static electrical conductivity @xmath31 demonstrates step - like behavior : it grows rapidly at 5  kk  @xmath32  kk and remains almost constant at 20  kk  @xmath33  kk .",
    "similar step - like curves for reflectivity along principal hugoniots of carbon - hydrogen plastics were obtained in the previous works @xcite .",
    "the second reason for the current work is the drive to explain the obtained @xmath30 and @xmath31 dependences . during a @xmath14-calculation one of the temperatures ( @xmath5 or @xmath6 )",
    "is kept fixed while the other one is varied .",
    "this helps to understand better the influence of @xmath5 and @xmath6 on the one - temperature @xmath30 and @xmath31 dependences .",

    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "the discussion of the results based on the investigation of radial distribution functions ( rdfs ) is also available in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "the computation technique is based on quantum molecular dynamics , density functional theory ( dft ) in its kohn - sham formulation and the kubo - greenwood formula .",
    "the method of calculation for @xmath24 case was described in detail in our previous work @xcite and the papers @xcite .",
    "an example of @xmath14-calculation is present in our previous paper @xcite . here",
    "we will give only a brief overview of the employed technique .",
    "the computation method consists of three main stages : qmd simulation , precise resolution of the band structure and the calculation via the kg formula .    at the first stage",
    "@xmath36 atoms of carbon and @xmath37 atoms of hydrogen are placed in a supercell with periodic boundary conditions . the total number of atoms @xmath38 may be varied . at the given @xmath39 the size of the supercell is chosen to yield the correct density @xmath40 .",
    "ions are treated classically .",
    "the ions of carbon and hydrogen are placed in the random nodes of the auxiliary simple cubic lattice .",
    "we have discussed the choice of the initial ionic configuration and performed an overview of the works on this issue previously @xcite . then the qmd simulation is performed .",
    "the electronic structure is calculated at each qmd step within the born - oppenheimer approximation : electrons totally adjust to the current ionic configuration .",
    "this calculation is performed within the framework of dft : the finite - temperature kohn - sham equations are solved .",
    "the occupation numbers used during their solution are set by the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "the latter includes the electron temperature @xmath6 ; this is how the calculation depends on @xmath6 .",
    "the forces acting on each ion from the electrons and other ions are calculated at every step .",
    "the newton equations of motion are solved for the ions using these forces ; thus the ionic trajectories are calculated .",
    "additional forces are also acting on the ions from the nos thermostat .",
    "these forces are used to bring the total kinetic energy of ions @xmath41 to the average value @xmath42 after some period of simulation ; here @xmath43 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "this is how the calculation depends on @xmath5 .",
    "qmd simulation is performed using the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite .",
    "the ionic trajectories and the temporal dependence of the energy without the kinetic contribution of ions @xmath44(t)$ ] are obtained during the qmd simulation .",
    "the system comes to a two - temperature equilibrium state after some number of qmd steps is performed . in this state equilibrium",
    "exists only within the electronic and ionic subsystems separately .",
    "the exchange of energy between electrons and ions is absent , since the born - oppenheimer approximation is used during the qmd simulation .",
    "@xmath44(t)$ ] fluctuates around its average value in this two - temperature equilibrium state .",
    "a significant number of _ sequential _ qmd steps corresponding to the two - temperature equilibrium state are chosen .",
    "@xmath44(t)$ ] dependence is averaged over these sequential steps ; thus the thermodynamic value @xmath44 $ ] is obtained .",
    "if the dependence on time is not mentioned , @xmath44 $ ] denotes the thermodynamic value of the energy without the kinetic contribution of ions here .",
    "the thermodynamic value is then divided by the mass of the supercell ; this specific energy is designated by @xmath45 $ ] .    the total energy of electrons and ions @xmath46 may also be calculated .",
    "however , these data are not presented in this paper to understand better the temperature dependence of energy .",
    "the thermodynamic value of @xmath47 is @xmath42 because of the interaction with the nos thermostat .",
    "thus @xmath47 depends only on @xmath5 in a rather simple way : @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath44 $ ] may depend both on @xmath5 and @xmath6 in a complicated manner .",
    "the addition of @xmath49 will just obscure the @xmath44(t_i , t_e)$ ] dependence .",
    "if necessary , the total energy may be reconstructed easily .",
    "the _ separate _ configurations corresponding to the two - temperature equilibrium state are selected for the calculation of static electrical conductivity and optical properties . at the second stage",
    "the precise resolution of the band structure is performed for these separate configurations .",
    "the same kohn - sham equations as during the first stage are solved , though the technical parameters yielding a higher precision may be used . at this stage the kohn - sham eigenvalues , corresponding wave functions and occupation numbers are obtained .",
    "the precise resolution of the band structure is performed with the vasp package .",
    "then the obtained wave functions are used to calculate the matrix elements of the nabla operator ; this is done using the optics.f90 module of the vasp package .    at the third stage",
    "the real part of the dynamic electrical conductivity @xmath50 is calculated via the kg formula presented in our previous paper @xcite ; the formula includes matrix elements of the nabla operator , energy eigenvalues and occupation numbers calculated during the precise resolution of the band structure .",
    "we have created a parallel program to perform a calculation according to the kg formula , it uses data obtained by the vasp as input information .",
    "@xmath51 is obtained for each of the selected ionic configurations .",
    "these @xmath51 curves are then averaged to get the final @xmath50 .",
    "the static electrical conductivity @xmath35 is calculated via an extrapolation of @xmath50 to zero frequency .",
    "the simple linear extrapolation described in @xcite is used .",
    "a number of _ sequential _ ionic configurations corresponding to the @xmath14 equilibrium stage of the qmd simulation are also used to calculate rdfs .",
    "c - c , c - h and h - h rdfs are calculated with the visual molecular dynamics program ( vmd ) @xcite .",
    "the qmd simulation was performed with 120 atoms in the computational supercell ( 40 carbon atoms and 80 hydrogen atoms ) . at the initial moment",
    "the ions were placed in the random nodes of the auxiliary simple cubic lattice ( discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "then 15000 steps of the qmd simulation were performed , one step corresponded to 0.2  fs .",
    "thus the evolution of the system during 3  ps was tracked .",
    "the calculation was run in the framework of the local density approximation ( lda ) with the perdew ",
    "zunger parametrization ( set by eqs .",
    "( c3 ) , ( c5 ) and table  xii , the first column , of paper@xcite ) .",
    "we have applied the pseudopotentials of the projector augmented - wave ( paw @xcite ) type both for carbon and hydrogen .",
    "the paw pseudopotential for carbon took 4 electrons into account ( @xmath52 ) ; the core radius @xmath53 was equal to @xmath54 , here @xmath55 is the bohr radius . the paw pseudopotential for hydrogen allowed for 1 electron per atom ( @xmath56 ) , @xmath57 .",
    "the qmd simulation was performed with 1 * k*-point in the brillouin zone ( @xmath58-point ) and with the energy cut - off @xmath59  ev . all the bands with occupation numbers larger than @xmath60 were taken into account .",
    "the section of the qmd simulation corresponding to 0.5  ps  @xmath61  ps was used to average the temporal dependence @xmath44(t)$ ] .",
    "we have chosen 15 ionic configurations for the further calculation of @xmath35 .",
    "the first of these configurations corresponded to @xmath62  ps , the time span between the neighboring configurations also was @xmath63  ps . the band structure was calculated one more time for these selected configurations .",
    "the exchange - correlation functional , pseudopotential , number of @xmath64-points and energy cut - off were the same as during the qmd simulation .",
    "additional unoccupied bands were taken into account , they spanned an energy range of 40  ev .",
    "the @xmath51 curves were calculated for the selected ionic configurations at 0.005  ev  @xmath65  ev with a frequency step 0.005  ev .",
    "the @xmath66-function in the kg formula was broadened by the gaussian@xcite function with the standard deviation of 0.2  ev .",
    "the rdfs were calculated for the section of the qmd simulation corresponding to 1.8002  ps  @xmath67  ps for the distances 0.05  @xmath68  with the step of @xmath69  .    for computational results to be reliable ,",
    "the convergence by technical parameters should be checked .",
    "however , the full investigation of convergence is very time - consuming . in our previous works",
    "we have performed full research on convergence for aluminum @xcite and partial  for ch@xmath0 plasma @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite , that the number of atoms @xmath39 and the number of * k*-points @xmath70 during the precise resolution of the band structure contribute to the error of @xmath35 most of all ; the effect of these parameters is of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the size effects in ch@xmath0 plasma were investigated earlier:@xcite the results for @xmath35 were the same within several percents for 120 and 249 atoms in the supercell . in our current paper",
    "we use the same moderate @xmath39 and @xmath70 values as in @xcite .",
    "this introduces a small error to our results , but speeds up computations considerably .",
    "the following types of calculations were performed :    * one - temperature case with @xmath71 ; * @xmath14-computations at fixed @xmath5 and varied @xmath6 , so that @xmath72 ; * @xmath14-computations at fixed @xmath6 and varied @xmath5 , so that @xmath73 .",
