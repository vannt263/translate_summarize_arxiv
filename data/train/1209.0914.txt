    "the parameter @xmath26 measures the quantum electron recoil effect caused by the quantum bohm potential @xcite @xmath27 compared to the quantum statistical fermi electron pressure and the electron - exchange and electron - correlation effects arising from @xmath1-spin of the degenerate electrons . here",
    "@xmath28 is the electron fermi speed and @xmath29^{1/2}$ ] includes the effects of electron exchange and electron correlations , where @xmath30 represents the average inter - electron distance .",

    "@xcite found that attractive potentials between ions exist only for @xmath34 .",

    "the maximum value is @xmath39 at @xmath40 , corresponding to the electron number density @xmath41 , a few times below solid densities .",
    "the validity of the seap has been further expanded @xcite for wider density ranges by including chandrasekhar s ( @xcite ) generalized pressure law for degenerate electron fluids and salpeter s ( @xcite ) electron - exchange and electron - correlation potentials that are of astrophysical interest ( e.g. the cores of white dwarf stars ) .",

    "@xmath78 , and with @xmath79 .",
    "the positions of ions at the end of the simulations are shown in fig . 4 at time @xmath80 . here",
    "the positions and time are in units of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively , where @xmath83 is the ion plasma frequency , and @xmath84 the equilibrium ion number density , related to the electron number density @xmath85 via the quasi - neutrality condition @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the ion charge state . for @xmath43 , which leads to a potential minimum ( cf .",
    "2 ) , we observe the clustering of ions and the formation of large - scale ionic structures .",
    "the clustering of ions is a relatively slow process in comparison with the ion plasma period @xmath88 .",
    "ion pairs and smaller clusters are initially formed , and later the larger ion clusters are gradually formed by the agglomeration of smaller ion clusters . as a contrast , for @xmath44 , we see in fig .",
    "4 that there does not exist condensation / coalescence of ions .",
    "this is due to the fact that there is no potential minimum for this value of @xmath26 ( cf .",
    "2 ) , and hence the inter - ion force is always repulsive for this case .",
    "furthermore , we have carried out a set of simulations with a symmetric potential @xmath77 with @xmath89 . here , as seen in fig . 5 , almost spherical",
    "non - coulombic ion crystals are formed for both @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we also performed simulations including an asymmetric external potential @xmath77 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 , providing a stronger confinement in the perpendicular direction .",
    "figure 6 displays the final state for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where ions , in both cases , form non - coulombic ion crystals elongated along the @xmath75-direction . in general , the formation of non - coulombic ion crystals is attributed to the balance between the external and inter - ion potentials , where the system tends to a configuration of a minimum potential energy .",
    "we note that similar configurations have been previously reported for both charged macro - particles @xcite and ions @xcite confined by external potentials in the paul trap . finally , in figs . 7 and 8",
    ", we continued the simulations in figs . 5 and 6 and set the external confining potential to zero at time @xmath92 .",
    "for both cases , with symmetric and asymmetric potentials , we see that ion crystals remained tightly packed for @xmath43 , where it performed damped oscillations as elastic solids before settling down to the final states in figs .",
    "7(a ) and 8(a ) .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath44 , the ion cloud expanded to larger and less dense ion clouds , as seen in figs 7(b ) and 8(b ) at @xmath93 .",
    "hence the short - range potential around ions for @xmath43 ( cf .",
    "2 ) lead to the solidification of the ions , which is not the case for the the short - range repulsive potential for @xmath44 .",
    "in this paper , we have carried out particle simulations to demonstrate clustering of ions due to the newly found seaf arising from collective interactions between an ensemble of degenerate electrons that shield ions in dense quantum plasmas .",
    "specifically , the seaf leads to clustering / condensation or coagulation of ions in the absence of an external confining potential for charged particles .",
    "however , ion clustering can be put on the firm footing by calculating the dynamical ion structure factor ( disf ) based on the fluctuation - dissipation theorem and the dielectric constant of degenerate electrons and strongly correlated ions in a viscous quantum plasma .",
    "it may well turn out that the disf will reveal long - range correlations between ions .",
    "it is our belief that the formation of ion nano - clusters is going to play a valuable role in the area of high - density compressed plasmas with degenerate electrons @xcite for icf to succeed , and also in the emerging field of nano - material sciences ( e.g. nanodiodes , metallic nanostructures for thin films @xcite , nanowires ) , where closely - packed ions will lend support to enhanced fusion probabilities ( with anomalous fusion cross - sections ) for controlled thermonuclear icf , and may also influence the electric properties ( e.g. resistivity ) of new high density plasma materials at relatively high temperatures .",
    "finally , we stress that the cooper pairing of ions at atomic dimensions shall provide possibility of novel superconducting plasma - based nanotechnology , since the electron transport in nanostructures would be rapid due to shortened distances between ions in the presence of the novel seaf .      99 akbari - moghanjoughi , m. 2012 shukla - eliasson attractive force : revisited .",

    "<S> the attraction between like - charged dust particles forming dust coulomb crystals may also be attributed to attractive forces arising from overlapping of the dusty plasma debye spheres @xcite , ion focusing and wakefield effects @xcite , and dust dipole - dipole interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cooper s pairing of charged dust particles , which are glued by ions , led to the discovery of a soft- condensed matter of dust particle crystals in low - density and low - temperature classical plasma with maxwell - boltzmann distributions for electrons and ions . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that several milestones were reached in the areas of ordered crystalline structures composed of charged particles ( e.g. an ensemble of in low - temperature physical systems electrons , ions , as well as charged colloidal and dust particles ) in physical systems , which share some common physics .    </S>",
    "<S> however , solid density plasmas are of fundamental importance for industrial applications ( e.g. semiconductors , nano - diodes and metallic nanostructures for thin films ) , for inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) schemes that utilizes high density compressed ( hdc ) plasmas , as well as for planetary systems [ e.g. the core of jupiter @xcite ] and superdense astrophysical objects ( e.g the cores of white dwarf stars , warm dense matter ) . </S>",
    "<S> in dense plasmas , one has to account for degeneracy @xcite of electrons which obey the fermi - dirac distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , quantum mechanical effects play a vital role since in such dense plasmas the wigner - seitz radius @xmath3 is comparable to the thermal de broglie wavelength @xmath4 ( which is a measure of the extent of electron wave functions ) , where @xmath5 is planck s constant divided by @xmath6 , @xmath7 the electron mass , @xmath8 the electron thermal speed due to random electron motions , and @xmath9 the boltzmann constant . </S>",
    "<S> also , in dense plasmas with degenerate electrons , @xmath10 turns out to be much smaller than the landau length @xmath11 , which can be conveniently expressed as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the bohr radius of a hydrogen atom . </S>",
    "<S> the electron degeneracy effects at nanoscales in dense plasmas can thus be captured through the consideration of the fermi - dirac statistics for electrons with spin-@xmath1 ( fermions ) , and overlapping of electron wavefunctions due to heisenberg s uncertainty principle and pauli s exclusion principle , as well as electron - exchange and electron - correlations . </S>",
    "<S> hence , there are quantum forces @xcite associated with the quantum statistical electron pressure @xcite , the quantum bohm potential @xcite through which degenerate electrons can tunnel through ( often known as the quantum electron recoil effect ) , as well as the electron - exchange and electron - correlations potentials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found that the above mentioned quantum forces acting on degenerate electrons in quantum plasmas introduce new dispersive features to electron plasma oscillations @xcite with frequencies in the x - ray regime , which can be assessed by using collective x - ray spectroscopic scattering techniques @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xcite have reported observations of electron plasma oscillations ( epos ) in warm dense matter ( with the peak electron number density @xmath14 @xmath15 and the equilibrium electron and ion temperatures of 12 ev ( @xmath16 degrees kelvin ) . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is different from the electron fermi temperature @xmath17 degrees kelvin , corresponding to an electron number density @xmath18 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the recent experiments of @xcite have unambiguously demonstrated the importance of the quantum statistical pressure and quantum electron recoil effects on the frequency spectra of epos @xcite , although a previous experimental investigation @xcite had already established the quantum dispersion properties of epos in metals .    </S>",
    "<S> very recently , @xcite discovered an oscillating shielded coulomb ( osc ) potential , ( also referred to as the shukla - eliasson attractive potential ( seap ) @xcite ) , which is valid for the potential energy much smaller than @xmath19 and @xmath20 , around a stationary test ion in an unmagnetized quantum plasma , where @xmath21 is the speed of light in vacuum . the seap arises due to collective interactions between an ensemble of degenerate electrons that shield an isolated ion at atomic dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the profile of the seap in quantum plasmas resembles the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential in atomic gases . the shukla - eliasson attractive force ( seaf ) , defined as minus the gradient of the seap , brings ions closer to form ion clusters in quantum plasmas . in this paper , we demonstrate the formation of ion clusters at atomic dimensions by performing computer simulations of the equations of motion for an ensemble of ions that are interacting with each other through the seaf . </S>"
