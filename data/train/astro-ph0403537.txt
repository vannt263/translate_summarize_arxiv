    "recently , millimeter and submillimeter spectroscopy of the dense interstellar medium has shown that , in cold dense regions , deuterated molecular species are highly abundant , sometimes more than 10@xmath3 of the h version .",
    "amazingly , doubly and triply deuterated species can be observed , e.g. d@xmath0co @xcite , nhd@xmath0 @xcite , chd@xmath0oh @xcite , d@xmath0s @xcite , nd@xmath2 @xcite , cd@xmath2oh @xcite .",
    "several models have been developed to account for such high levels of deuteration @xcite .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that the deuteration of h@xmath2@xmath1 will be extended beyond h@xmath0d@xmath1 , to d@xmath0h@xmath1 and d@xmath2@xmath1 , and that detection of d@xmath0h@xmath1 might be possible . a calculation taking a high degree of deuteration into account",
    "has been carried out by @xcite and @xcite , confirming the expectation that , in dense depleted regions , the abundance of d@xmath0h@xmath1 will be similar to that of h@xmath0d@xmath1 , and that d@xmath2@xmath1 will be abundant .",
    "the key enabling work in the astronomical search for d@xmath0h@xmath1 is the laboratory measurement of the para ground - state transition ( 1@xmath4 - 1@xmath5 ) by @xcite .",
    "we report here the first astronomical detection of that transition .",
    "+ chemical reactions go in the direction to minimize energy .",
    "the chemical fractionation process favors the production of the heavier more deuterated species , because of the mass dependence of the zero - point vibration energies of the isotopic variants .",
    "gas phase species are expected to be depleted at the centers of cold , dark clouds , since they accrete on the dust grains ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a series of observations has shown that the abundances of molecules like co decrease in many pre - stellar cores @xcite .",
    "the removal of these reactive species affects the gas - phase chemistry and particularly the deuterium fractionation within the cloud .",
    "indeed , the removal of species that would normally destroy h@xmath2@xmath1 ( e.g. co ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) means that h@xmath2@xmath1 is more likely to react with hd and produce h@xmath0d@xmath1 .",
    "for example , if [ co / h@xmath0 ]  @xmath7  5 @xmath8 10@xmath9 @xcite , this leaves hd at [ hd / h@xmath0 ]  @xmath7  5 @xmath8 10@xmath10 as the most abundant molecule available for reaction with h@xmath11 and h@xmath0d@xmath1 , and favors the production of high deuterium content molecules :    @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14    where @xmath15e@xmath16 , @xmath15e@xmath17 and @xmath15e@xmath18 are the released energies of the exothermic reactions . using the zero - point energies computed by @xcite , and the energy of the first allowed rotational state of the h@xmath11 molecule permitted by the pauli exclusion principle ( @xmath7 92 k ) ,",
    "these values are : @xmath15e@xmath16 = @xmath7 230 k , @xmath15e@xmath17 = @xmath7 180 k and @xmath15e@xmath18 = @xmath7 230 k.    after a long frustrating search @xcite , and with the advent of new submillimeter receivers , h@xmath0d@xmath1 was detected toward two young stellar objects , ngc 1333 iras 4a ( stark et al .",
    "1999 ) and iras 16293 - 2422a ( stark et al . 2004 ) , although with relatively low signal strength .",
    "the h@xmath0d@xmath1 search has now been extended to pre - stellar cores , and has been detected with relatively strong emission ( caselli et al .",
    "2003 ; caselli et al .",
    "2004 , _ in preparation _ ; vastel et al . 2004 , _ in preparation _ ) confirming that h@xmath0d@xmath1 is dramatically enhanced in a gas depleted of most molecules .",
    "the ammonia and dco@xmath1 emission around the proto - binary system iras16293 - 2422 @xcite does not only peak on iras16293 - 2422 itself but shows a second peak , about 90@xmath19 to the southeast , in a condensation called 16293e .",
    "@xcite found that co in this region is depleted by a factor of 7 .",
    "it is known to be a region where deuterium fractionation is strong and was chosen to be searched for d@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "the pure rotational transition ( 1@xmath4 - 1@xmath5 ) of d@xmath0h@xmath1 has been measured in the laboratory by @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations of 16293e , presented here , were carried out in february 2004 using the facility receivers and spectrometers of the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the position chosen was the dco@xmath1 peak emission ( @xmath20=16h32m29.4s , @xmath21=-24@xmath2228@xmath2352.6@xmath19 , lis et al .",
    "we observed both the 1@xmath4 - 1@xmath24 transition of ortho - h@xmath0d@xmath1 ( @xmath25 = 372.42134(20 ) ghz , * ? ? ? * ) and the 1@xmath4 - 1@xmath5 transition of para - d@xmath0h@xmath1 ( @xmath25 = 691.660440(19 ) ghz , * ? ? ? * ) ( see figures [ figure1 ] and [ figure2 ] ) which are the only lines currently available for these species .",
    "the data were taken under good weather conditions ( 225 ghz zenith opacity between 0.03 and 0.05 ) .",
    "the cso main beam efficiencies are @xmath7 60% for the 345 ghz receiver and @xmath7 40% for the 650 ghz receiver , determined from total power observations of mars and saturn . if the emission is extended compared to the beam size of cso , as appears to be the case for dco@xmath1 @xcite , then the efficiency is about 70% at 372 ghz and 60% at 692 ghz . the fwhm beam size at 372 ghz is about 20@xmath19 , compared to @xmath7 11@xmath19 at 692 ghz .",
    "typical calibration uncertainties are @xmath7 24% .",
    "the pointing of the telescope was determined from observations of jupiter , and was stable about @xmath7 2@xmath19 ( rms ) .",
    "we used both the 50 mhz and 500 mhz bandwidth acousto - optical facility spectrometers .",
    "the 500 mhz system was used to check system performance and calibration with the co ( 6 @xmath26 5 ) line , which is offset by @xmath7 82 km  s@xmath3 from d@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "there are no known lines of other interstellar molecules within 50 mhz , likely to emit from such a cold region . in table",
    "[ table1 ] we report the frequency , the antenna temperature , the linewidth and the velocity relative to the local standard of rest , for the two lines . in figure [ figure3 ] , we present 8.2 @xmath27 and 4.4 @xmath27 detections of h@xmath0d@xmath1 and d@xmath0h@xmath1 respectively , obtained in 23 minutes and 103 minutes on - source integration time , respectively .    since the para ground - state transition for d@xmath0h@xmath1 is the only line available to existing telescope facilities , it is not possible to obtain confirmation of the identification",
    "however , the situation is very different from molecule detection in hot core regions , such as omc-1 , where line confusion is rampant . at the 692 ghz transition frequency",
    ", any heavy molecule would need to be in a high j state , but the 10 k excitation temperature means that any such state can not be occupied .",
    "of course , co ( 6 @xmath26 5 ) is observable , but only at t@xmath16@xmath28 = 2.3 k. no u - lines have been observed in this source .",
    "the identification rests on the comparison of the deduced v@xmath29 for d@xmath0h@xmath1 with that for other deuterated molecules , and also the line width and line strength .",
    "note that the quoted uncertainty for the line frequency is about 0.16 km  s@xmath3 for h@xmath0d@xmath1 and 0.008 km  s@xmath3 for d@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "the very slight difference in the observed v@xmath30 for these two lines ( @xmath7 0.2 km  s@xmath3 ) could be due , in part , to the uncertainty in the line frequencies , particularly h@xmath0d@xmath1 .",
    "also the accuracy of the astronomical measurement is limited by the resolution of the acousto - optic spectrometer at about 0.1 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "from the observed line strengths , given in column 3 of table [ table1 ] , we estimate the h@xmath0d@xmath1 and d@xmath0h@xmath1 column densities ( see table [ table2 ] ) for an excitation temperature t@xmath31 of 10 k , assuming a 25% calibration uncertainty ( 3 @xmath27 ) .",
    "the column density is given by :          where @xmath34 is the radiation temperature of a blackbody at a temperature t , and t@xmath35 is the cosmic background temperature of 2.7 k. in the case of the h@xmath0d@xmath1 transition , g@xmath36 = 9 , a@xmath37 = 1.04 10@xmath38 s@xmath3 , e@xmath37 = 17.9 k ; in the case of the d@xmath0h@xmath1 transition , g@xmath36 = 9 , a@xmath37 = 4.55 10@xmath38 s@xmath3 , e@xmath37 = 33.2 k. the derived column densities depend on the assumed value of the excitation temperature .",
    "using nh@xmath2 , @xcite estimate the gas temperature to be 12 k. using d@xmath0co line ratios , @xcite obtained a rotational temperature of 8 - 10 k. thus we quote , in table [ table2 ] , the values obtained for an excitation temperature of 10 k. figure [ figure4 ] presents the evolution of the ortho - h@xmath0d@xmath1 and para - d@xmath0h@xmath1 column densities as well as the para - d@xmath0h@xmath1/ortho - h@xmath0d@xmath1 ratio , as a function of temperature between 9 and 15 k. figure [ figure4 ] and table [ table2 ] represent the case where the source emission is extended compared to the beam size . if the source emission is comparable to or smaller than the cso beam size , the para - d@xmath0h@xmath1/ortho - h@xmath0d@xmath1 ratio is then increased by a factor of @xmath7 1.5 at the average excitation temperature of 10 k. at thermal equilibrium , the ortho to para ( respectively para to ortho ) concentration ratio for h@xmath0d@xmath1 ( respectively d@xmath0h@xmath1 ) is equal to 9 @xmath8 exp(-86.4/t ) ( respectively 9/6 @xmath8 exp(-50.2/t ) ) , so that at 10 k , this ratio would be @xmath7 2 @xmath8 10@xmath39 ( respectively @xmath7 10@xmath40 ) .",
    "however , taking into account the limited rates of the spin allowed collisions with h@xmath0 , it is found that at these low temperatures , the ortho to para h@xmath0d@xmath1 concentration ratio is close to unity @xcite .",
    "the para to ortho d@xmath0h@xmath1 ratio is estimated by @xcite to be about one , for the same conditions .",
    "the para - d@xmath0h@xmath1/ortho - h@xmath0d@xmath1 ratio presented in figure [ figure4 ] should then approximately represent the actual d@xmath0h@xmath1/h@xmath0d@xmath1 ratio .",
    "the 1.3 mm dust continuum strength ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is @xmath7 0.3 jy in a 11@xmath19 beam and @xmath7 1.3 jy in a 20@xmath19 beam corresponding to the angular resolution of the h@xmath0d@xmath1 and d@xmath0h@xmath1 data . assuming a dust temperature of 12 k and a mass opacity coefficient of 0.005 @xmath41  g@xmath3 ( appropriate for pre - stellar cores )",
    ", we derive an h@xmath0 column density of @xmath7 5  10@xmath42 cm@xmath40 .",
    "we then derive the h@xmath0d@xmath1 and d@xmath0h@xmath1 abundances to range between @xmath7 10@xmath44 ( at 10 k ) and @xmath7 10@xmath45 ( at 15 k ) compatible with abundances found by @xcite for a cloud at 10 k and n(h@xmath0)=3 10@xmath46 cm@xmath39 .    the main result of this work is _ the detection of d@xmath0h@xmath1 , with an abundance comparable to that of h@xmath0d@xmath1_. this is a remarkable verification of recent theoretical predictions , aimed at explaining the large deuteration ratios observed in low mass pre - stellar cores and protostars .",
    "two models , @xcite and @xcite , have recently considered the effect of including all possible deuterated isotopomers of h@xmath11 in the chemical networks , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the temporal evolution of a cold and dense cloud , and found that at late times ( @xmath7 10@xmath48 yr ) , when co is severely depleted in the gas phase ( more than a factor of 1000 ) , the d@xmath0h@xmath1/h@xmath0d@xmath1 ratio reaches unity .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of gas , depleted in co , as a function of gas density and grain size distribution . for densities larger than 10@xmath46 cm@xmath39",
    ", they also found that d@xmath2@xmath1 can be the most abundant ion and that the d@xmath0h@xmath1/h@xmath0d@xmath1 ratio reaches unity ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "both models need an extreme co depletion to account for such a ratio . as discussed in the introduction , the measured co depletion in 16293e",
    "is a factor 7 @xcite , rather than the extreme co depletion needed by the models .",
    "however , the co was measured in a large region ( 31 \" ) compared with that probed by the present observations : 20@xmath19 for the h@xmath0d@xmath1 and 11@xmath19 for the d@xmath0h@xmath1 observations .",
    "also , regions containing co will not contain much h@xmath0d@xmath1 and d@xmath0h@xmath1 and vice - versa , so the inevitable inhomogeneities in the region inhibit a clear result .    in summary , after some years of inconclusive results for theoretical models in understanding the observed high deuteration ratios of doubly and triply deuterated molecules , the present observation seems to suggest that the basic process is now almost completely understood : the large deuteration is due to extreme co depletion , and the factor that was previously missing in the models is the multiply deuterated forms of h@xmath11 .",
    "this is quite an achievement , and one remaining step will be to verify that the last prediction , a significant abundance of d@xmath11 , is also fulfilled . at present , the lines detected here are the only ones available for h@xmath0d@xmath1 and d@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "knowledge of the ortho to para ratios and abundances of h@xmath0d@xmath1 and d@xmath0h@xmath1 would be considerably improved if the ground state transitions of para - h@xmath0d@xmath1 ( at 1370.15 ghz ) and ortho - d@xmath0h@xmath1 ( at 1476.60 ghz ) were available .",
    "these lines could be detected from space telescopes such as herschel with the heterodyne instrument for the far - infrared and also possibly from the stratospheric observatory sofia .",
    "however , d@xmath2@xmath1 , like h@xmath2@xmath1 has no permanent dipole moment .",
    "therefore this molecule probably can only be detected in absorption in the near - infrared .",
    "the authors are grateful to john pearson for providing an earlier spectroscopic computation for d@xmath0h@xmath1 and to cecilia ceccarelli for discussion .",
