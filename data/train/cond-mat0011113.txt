    "the fracture of a material under different loading conditions is a complicated phenomenon that continues to attract the attention of several physicists and engineers .",
    "the fracture follows a sequential process of nucleation , growth , and coalescence of numerous cracks .",
    "these cracks tend to create a rough profile which often can be described by self - affine scaling @xcite . in the last decade ,",
    "great theoretical and experimental efforts have been done trying to understand the process of formation and propagation of cracks in materials .",
    "a great number of studies have been devoted to this process from the point of view of statistical mechanics , that utilize concepts such as percolation , fractals , scaling law , etc .",
    "a variety of computational models for material fracture have been developed in recent years and provided interesting results @xcite .",
    "however , the high degree of correlations between the constituents leads to a high computational cost .",
    "an alternative is to employ fiber bundle models introduced more than forty years ago @xcite , in which bundles of unidirectional fibers form a system with low degree of correlations allowing the fracture process to be simulated in a large scale .",
    "the fracture of the material can occur through a big crack which percolates the sample . in this case",
    "we say that the fracture is catastrophic .",
    "when the fusion of small cracks cause the fracture of the material , it is called shredding @xcite . in the catastrophic regime",
    "the fracture profile is reasonably smooth , while in the shredding regime it is very rough .",
    "a parameter of easy physical interpretation used to characterize fracture surfaces is the roughness .",
    "it is defined as the variance around of the mean height of the fracture profile , and measures the complexity of the crack path .",
    "thus , the rougher is the fracture profile the harder is the crack path .",
    "the roughness has a direct relation to the fractal dimension , which characterizes the fractal character of the surface fracture .",
    "therefore , a high fractal dimension indicates a very rough fracture profile @xcite .",
    "another important parameter in the study of fracture , is the fracture toughness .",
    "this quantity measures the amount of energy that a material can absorb before it fractures .",
    "the fracture toughness is intimately related to the amount of cracks that appear in the material @xcite .",
    "therefore , the larger the number of cracks in the sample more energy will be absorbed before catastrophic fracture occurs .",
    "there are several works in the literature which investigate the relationship between the fracture roughness and the fracture toughness @xcite .    in the present rapid communication",
    ", we simulated a model for fracture in fibrous materials which allows us to obtain the fracture profile of samples in contrast with previous models @xcite .",
    "we calculate the profile roughness and used the obtained values to define the transition between two fracture regimes : catastrophic and shredding .",
    "we also investigate the relationship between the fracture roughness and toughness for fibrous materials .",
    "our model consists of a ( 1 + 1)d bundle of @xmath0 parallel fibers all with the same elastic constant @xmath1 . in order to simulate the height of the sample ,",
    "the fibers are divided in @xmath2 segments with the same length .",
    "the fiber bundle is fixed at both ends to two parallel plates .",
    "one plate is fixed , and in the other , a constant force @xmath3 is applied , for example , by hanging a weight on it .",
    "this force is shared in the same amount , @xmath4 , on each fiber of the bundle , which undergo the same linear deformation @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of unbroken fibers .",
    "when the deformation @xmath7 reaches a critical value @xmath8 , the failure probability of an isolated fiber is equal to 1 .",
    "the failure probability of a fiber _ i _ is given by @xcite @xmath9 , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the number of unbroken neighboring fibers , @xmath11 is the strain of the material , @xmath12 is the normalized temperature , @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath14 is the absolute temperature , and @xmath15 is the critical elastic energy . in this model , besides finding the failure probability of a fiber , we have to indicate in which segment it breaks .",
    "this segment is randomly selected and the probability of the fiber to break in it is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a vector which indicates how many times a segment @xmath18 broke and @xmath19 .",
    "the form of the eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) simulates a concentration of tension near to the region where the fiber bundle is more weak .    at the beginning of the simulation ,",
    "the bundle is submitted to a initial strain given by @xmath20 at each time step of the simulation we randomly choose a fiber of a set of @xmath21 unbroken fibers .",
    "the number @xmath22 represents a percentage of fibers and allows us to work with any system size .",
    "then , using eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) we evaluate the fiber failure probability @xmath23 and compare it with a random number @xmath24 in the interval [ 0,1 ) . if @xmath25 the fiber breaks .",
    "we then choose a segment @xmath18 in the fiber and evaluate its probability @xmath26 to break , using eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) . if the probability @xmath26 is higher than the random number @xmath27 the fiber breaks in the chosen segment .",
    "if not , we analyze the neighboring segments @xmath28 and @xmath29 and again , evaluate the probability @xmath26 .",
    "if the condition @xmath30 does not hold to neither of the neighboring segments , we return to the initial segment and test the condition @xmath30 for a new value of @xmath27 .",
    "this process continues until the condition @xmath30 is true .",
    "once defined the segment where the fiber breaks , we begin to test all neighboring unbroken fibers .",
    "the first segment tested in the neighboring unbroken fibers is the segment where the previous fiber broke .",
    "the failure probability @xmath23 of these neighboring fibers increases due to the decreasing of @xmath10 and a cascade of breaking fibers may begin .",
    "this procedure describes the propagation of a crack through the fiber bundle , which occurs in the perpendicular direction to the applied force .",
    "the process of propagation stops when the test of the probability does not allow rupture of any other fiber on the border of the crack or when the crack meets another already formed crack .",
    "the same cascade propagation is attempted by choosing another fiber of the set @xmath31 .",
    "after all the @xmath31 fibers have been tested , the strain @xmath32 is increased if some fibers have been broken .",
    "since the force is fixed , the greater the number of broken fibers , the larger is the strain on the intact fibers and the higher is their failure probability .",
    "then , another set of @xmath31 unbroken fibers is chosen and the entire rupture process is restarted .",
    "the simulation terminates when all the fibers of the bundle are broken , i.e. , when the bundle breaks apart . at this stage",
    "we consider the profile of the fracture and analyze its statistical properties .",
    "using the model described in the preceding section we simulated the fracture of a fibrous materials under a static force @xmath3 . in these simulations we considered the elastic constant @xmath33 , the critical deformation @xmath34 , the number of segments @xmath35 and the normalized temperature @xmath36 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the fracture profile for a set of @xmath37 fibers and three different forces .",
    "notice that , the lower the applied force the larger is the roughness of the fracture profile , i.e. , more irregular is the crack path . for @xmath38 only one crack propagates in the material and for @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "more than one crack crosses the material .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , that the rupture of the sample begins in different segments .",
    "this occurs because we did not consider a deterministic starting notch in our simulations .",
    "figure [ fig2](a ) shows the results obtained for the roughness @xmath41 as a function of the applied force @xmath3 for different values of @xmath0 . to measure the roughness of the fracture profile we used the method of the best linear least - square fitting described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this plot",
    "we can observe that the roughness @xmath41 decreases as the force @xmath3 increases , and after a critical force @xmath42 it stays constant .",
    "for each system size we have a characteristic value for @xmath42 , which increases with the increase of the number of fibers @xmath0 .",
    "this indicates that the greater the number of fibers in the bundle , the tougher is the sample . for @xmath43",
    "the fracture is catastrophic , i.e. , the breakage of a fiber induces the rupture of the whole bundle . in this case",
    "the bundle breaks with only one crack . in this region",
    "the crack propagates in the material with high speed , leading to a quite rapid rupture process . for @xmath44",
    "the rupture of the bundle occurs due to the formation of small cracks , which weaken the bundle . here",
    ", the crack speed tends to zero and a slow process of successive ruptures appears in the material .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , the x axis was converted to the initial strain @xmath45 .",
    "the data are now found to collapse all on the same roughness - strain curve . from this curve",
    "we can find the critical initial strain @xmath46 , which does not depend on the system size .",
    "our results indicate @xmath47 .",
    "we may assume that , for an initial strain greater than @xmath46 just one crack provokes the rupture of the material and that , for a initial strain below @xmath46 the rupture occurs through the fusion of small cracks .",
    "the critical value @xmath46 can be obtained analytically .",
    "the failure probability , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , can be written as    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is defined as @xcite    @xmath50 . \\label{eq5}\\ ] ]    using eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) we may observe that for @xmath51 the breakage of any fiber induces the rupture of the bundle with just one crack .",
    "then , we can assume that there is a critical value for @xmath51 that defines the transition between two regimes .",
    "in the first regime , a catastrophic fracture occurs in the first attempt to break the bundle , while in the second one the rupture of the bundle occurs due to the formation of small cracks , which weaken the bundle . from eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) we can show that the normalized temperature can be given by @xmath52 so , for @xmath36 and @xmath53 , eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) will be valid only if @xmath54    now we proceed to the evaluation of the fracture toughness @xmath55 .",
    "it can be defined by the work done to break the fiber bundle and is given by    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the work done to break each fiber of the bundle .",
    "the work @xmath57 is obtained by the following expression    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the deformation of the fiber _ i_.    figure [ fig3 ] shows the log - log plot of the fracture toughness @xmath60 versus the force @xmath3 for different system sizes .",
    "this figure shows how the fracture toughness @xmath55 decreases with the increase of the force @xmath3 , until it reaches a minimum value .",
    "this value is attained when a critical force @xmath42 is applied to the system . above of @xmath42",
    "the fiber bundle breaks catastrophically .",
    "it is known experimentally that a catastrophic break consumes little energy .",
    "as the force @xmath3 decreases below @xmath42 , the material can absorb more energy before it fractures and the number of cracks in the material increases .",
    "also , notice that the fracture toughness increases with the system size .",
    "thus , the higher the number of fibers the more energy will be absorbed by fracture .",
    "some works in the literature conjecture that there is a relationship between the fractal dimension and the fracture toughness @xcite , while others conjecture that such relationship does not exist @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigated the connection between the roughness @xmath41 , directly related to the fractal dimension , and the toughness fracture @xmath60 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows how the roughness @xmath41 changes with the toughness @xmath60 for several number of fibers @xmath0 . in this figure",
    "we can see that the roughness @xmath41 increases with the increase of the fracture toughness @xmath60 , until it reaches a stationary state .",
    "we can interpret this figure in the following manner : with the increase of @xmath60 , small cracks appear at all parts of the sample , making the fracture profile rougher . in the saturation region",
    ", we have a larger number of small cracks and they are totally uncorrelated .",
    "the phenomenon of saturation constitutes a finite size effect and is related to the number of segments in which the fibers are divided .",
    "in conclusion , we studied a model for fracture in fibrous materials in ( 1 + 1)dimensions which take into account the rupture height of the fibers , in contrast with previous models .",
    "we obtained the fracture profile and evaluate its roughness and toughness . in this work",
    "we show that in the catastrophic regime the roughness of the fracture profile is reasonably smooth . in the shredding regime , in which slow cracks are formed in the material",
    ", the fracture profile is very rough . in this regime",
    "the energy necessary to break the material is higher than in the catastrophic regime .",
    "our results indicate that the roughness @xmath41 is related to the fracture toughness .",
    "we believe that the search for possible relationships between the roughness and the fracture toughness could stimulate the further studies in order to check whether these relations are valid or not .",
