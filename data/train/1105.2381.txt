    "<S> the good agreement between the theory and the data allows the extraction of the probabilities for the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 five - quark fock states in the proton . </S>",

    "<S> brodsky , hoyer , peterson , and sakai ( bhps )  @xcite suggested some time ago that there are two distinct components of the nucleon sea . </S>",
    "<S> the first is called the  extrinsic \" sea originating from the splitting of gluons into @xmath9 pairs . </S>",
    "<S> this extrinsic sea can be well described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . </S>",
    "<S> another component of the nucleon sea is the  intrinsic \" sea which has a nonperturbative origin . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath10 five - quark fock states can lead to the  valence - like \" intrinsic sea for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the proton . </S>",
    "<S> this intrinsic component is expected to carry a relatively large momentum fraction @xmath8 , in contrast to the extrinsic one peaking at the small-@xmath8 region . </S>",
    "<S> brodsky _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite proposed that the @xmath13 five - quark state can lead to enhanced production of charmed hadrons at the forward rapidity region . </S>",
    "<S> the cteq collaboration  @xcite has examined all relevant hard - scattering data and concluded that the data are consistent with a wide range of the intrinsic charm magnitude , ranging from null to 2 - 3 times larger than the estimate by the bhps model . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that more precise experimental measurements are needed for determining the magnitude of the intrinsic charm component .    in a recent work  @xcite , we generalized the bhps model of the five - quark fock states to the light - quark sector . </S>",
    "<S> this work was motivated by the expectation that the probability for the @xmath14 fock state is approximately proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mass of the quark @xmath11  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although this @xmath15 dependence is applicable only when the quark mass is heavy  @xcite , the light five - quark states @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are likely to have significantly larger probabilities than the @xmath13 state , and could be more readily observed experimentally .    by solving the bjorken-@xmath8 distribution of the @xmath12 sea quark for the @xmath10 five - quark state in the bhps model numerically , </S>",
    "<S> it was found  @xcite that the existing @xmath20 and @xmath21 data can be well described by the calculation , provided that the qcd evolution  @xcite of these distributions is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the probabilities for the @xmath17 and the @xmath22 five - quark states could also be extracted from these data . </S>",
    "<S> however , the extracted values of these two probabilities depend on the assumption adopted for the probability of the @xmath19 state  @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , the previous work is extended further to determine the probability of the @xmath19 five - quark state using the recent @xmath23 data from the hermes collaboration  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the @xmath23 data in the @xmath24 region are quite well described by the bhps model , allowing the extraction of the probability of the @xmath25 state . using this probability for the @xmath25 five - quark component , more precise values for the @xmath26 and the @xmath22 states </S>",
    "<S> could then be obtained from the comparison of the bhps calculations with the @xmath27 and @xmath21 data . </S>",
    "<S> we have also examined the effect of the qcd evolution on the @xmath8 distribution of the intrinsic charm . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the region most sensitive to intrinsic charm is shifted to lower @xmath8 as a result of qcd evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this has implication on future searches for intrinsic charm .    for a @xmath10 five - quark fock state of the proton , </S>",
    "<S> the probability for quark @xmath28 to carry a momentum fraction @xmath29 is given in the bhps model  @xcite as @xmath30^{-2 } , \\label{eq : prob5q_a}\\ ] ] where the delta function ensures that the proton momentum is shared among the individual constituents . </S>",

    "<S> for the more general case , eq .  [ eq : prob5q_a ] can be solved numerically as discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the @xmath8 distribution of @xmath12 in the @xmath10 state , called @xmath35 , can be calculated numerically . </S>",
    "<S> the moment of @xmath36 is defined as @xmath37 , namely , @xmath38 @xmath37 represents the probability of the @xmath39 five - quark fock state in the proton . in the limit of @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> , one can obtain  @xcite @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> for the more general case , the relation between @xmath37 and @xmath31 can be calculated numerically  @xcite .    to compare the experimental data with the prediction based on the intrinsic five - quark fock state , it is necessary to separate the contributions of the intrinsic sea quark and the extrinsic one . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath42 is an example of quantities which are free from the contributions of the extrinsic sea quarks , since the perturbative @xmath43 processes will generate @xmath44 and @xmath45 pairs with equal probabilities and have no contribution to this quantity . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath42 data from the fermilab e866 drell - yan experiment at the @xmath46 scale of 54 gev@xmath47  @xcite are shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> two different initial scales , @xmath49 and @xmath50 gev , were used for the e866 calculations in order to illustrate the dependence on the choice of the initial scale.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the bhps model has a specific prediction on the shapes of the @xmath8 distributions for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , since these anti - quarks originate from the @xmath22 and @xmath53 configurations and can be readily calculated . in the bhps model , the @xmath52 and @xmath51 are predicted to have the same @xmath8-dependence if @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the probabilities of the @xmath55 and @xmath17 configurations , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , are not known from the bhps model , and remain to be determined by the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> non - perturbative effects such as pauli - blocking  @xcite could lead to different probabilities for the @xmath22 and @xmath17 configurations . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the shape of the @xmath42 distribution shall be identical to those of @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the bhps model . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the normalization of @xmath60 is known from the measurement of fermilab e866 drell - yan experiment  @xcite as @xmath61 equation  [ eq : intdbarubar1 ] allows us to compare the calculations from the bhps model with the @xmath42 data .    the @xmath42 distribution from the bhps model is first calculated using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : prob5q_a ] with @xmath62 gev/@xmath63 , and @xmath64 gev/@xmath63 , and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : intdbarubar1 ] for the normalization . since the e866 and the hermes data were obtained at @xmath46 of 54 gev@xmath47 and 2.5 gev@xmath47 , respectively , it is important to evolve the @xmath42 distribution from the initial scale @xmath65 , expected to be around the confinement scale , to the @xmath46 corresponding to the data . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath42 is a flavor non - singlet parton distribution , its evolution from @xmath65 to @xmath11 only depends on the values of @xmath42 at the initial scale @xmath65 , and can be readily calculated using the non - singlet evolution equation  @xcite . for the initial scale , we adopt the value of @xmath66 gev , which was chosen by glck , reya , and vogt  @xcite in the so - called  dynamical approach \" using only valence - like distributions at the initial @xmath67 scale and relying on evolution to generate the quark and gluon distributions at higher @xmath46 .    </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath8-dependence of the e866 @xmath69 data is quite well described by the five - quark fock states in the bhps model provided that the @xmath46-evolution is taken into consideration . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that an excellent fit to the data can be obtained if @xmath70 gev is chosen ( dashed curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dbarubar ] ) rather than the more conventional value of @xmath49 gev . </S>",
    "<S> also shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dbarubar ] are the calculations with the bhps model evolved to @xmath71 gev@xmath47 using @xmath49 gev and @xmath72 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are in agreement with the hermes data within the experimental uncertainties .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the extraction of the @xmath73 five - quark component from existing data . </S>",
    "<S> the hermes collaboration reported the determination of @xmath74 over the range of @xmath75 at @xmath76 gev@xmath47 from their measurement of charged kaon production in sidis reaction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hermes data , shown in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  [ fig_ssbar ] , exhibits an intriguing feature . </S>",
    "<S> a rapid fall - off of the strange sea is observed as @xmath8 increases up to @xmath77 , above which the data become relatively independent of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the data suggest the presence of two different components of the strange sea , one of which dominates at small @xmath8 @xmath78 and the other at larger @xmath8 @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is consistent with the expectation that the strange - quark sea consists of both the intrinsic and the extrinsic components having dominant contributions at large and small @xmath8 regions , respectively . in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the solid and dashed curves are results of the bhps model calculations evolved to @xmath81 gev@xmath47 using @xmath49 gev and @xmath70 gev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the normalizations are obtained by fitting only data with @xmath24 ( solid circles in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_ssbar ] ) , following the assumption that the extrinsic sea has negligible contribution relative to the intrinsic sea in the valence region . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows that the fits to the data are quite adequate , allowing the extraction of the probability of the @xmath73 state as @xmath82     data with the calculations based on the bhps model . </S>",
    "<S> the solid and dashed curves are obtained by evolving the bhps result to @xmath76 gev@xmath47 using @xmath83 gev and @xmath70 gev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the normalizations of the calculations are adjusted to fit the data at @xmath84 with statistical errors only , denoted by solid circles.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we consider next the quantity @xmath85 . combining the hermes data on @xmath86 with the @xmath87 distributions determined by the cteq group ( cteq6.6 )  @xcite , the quantity @xmath88 can be obtained and is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_sbar - dubar ] . </S>",
    "<S> this approach for determining @xmath89 is identical to that used by chen , cao , and signal in their recent study of strange quark sea in the meson - cloud model  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an important property of @xmath90 is that the contribution from the extrinsic sea vanishes , just like the case for @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this quantity is only sensitive to the intrinsic sea and can be compared with the calculation of the intrinsic sea in the bhps model . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath92 we can now compare the @xmath88 data with the calculation using the bhps model . since @xmath90 is a flavor non - singlet quantity , we can readily evolve the bhps prediction to @xmath71 gev@xmath47 using @xmath49 gev and the result is shown as the solid curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_sbar - dubar ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that a better fit to the data can again be obtained with @xmath70 gev , shown as the dashed curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_sbar - dubar ] .     </S>",
    "<S> data with the calculations based on the bhps model . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath74 are from the hermes experiment  @xcite , and those of @xmath87 are obtained from the pdf set cteq6.6  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the solid and dashed curves are obtained by evolving the bhps result to @xmath76 gev@xmath47 using @xmath83 gev and @xmath70 gev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the normalization of the calculations are adjusted to fit the data.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    from the comparison between the data and the bhps calculations shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dbarubar]-[fig_sbar - dubar ] , we can determine the probabilities for the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 configurations as follows : @xmath93 or @xmath94 depending on the value of the initial scale @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that the @xmath42 , the @xmath23 , and the @xmath95 data not only allow us to check the predicted @xmath8-dependence of the five - quark fock states , but also provide a determination of the probabilities for these states .    </S>",
    "<S> equations 6 shows that the combined probability for proton to be in the @xmath39 states is around 40% . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that an earlier analysis of the @xmath91 data in the meson cloud model concluded that proton has @xmath9660% probability to be in the three - quark bare - nucleon state  @xcite , in qualitative agreement with the finding of this study . </S>",
    "<S> a significant feature of the present work is the extraction of the @xmath97 component , which would be related to the kaon - hyperon states in the meson cloud model . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth mentioning that in the bhps model the @xmath39 states have the same contribution to the proton s magnetic moment as the @xmath98 three - quark state , since @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the @xmath39 states have no net magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the good description of the nucleon s magnetic moment by the constituent quark model is preserved even with the inclusion of a sizable five - quark components in the bhps model .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the probability for the @xmath97 state is smaller than those of the @xmath99 and the @xmath100 states . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the expectation that the probability for the @xmath39 five - quark state is roughly proportional to @xmath101  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can then estimate that the probability for the intrinsic charm from the @xmath102 fock state , @xmath103 to be roughly 0.01 . </S>",
    "<S> this is also consistent with an estimate based on the bag model  @xcite , as well as with an analysis of the emc charm - production data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 shows the @xmath8 distribution of intrinsic @xmath104 calculated with the bhps model using 1.5 gev / c@xmath47 for the mass of the charm quark . </S>",
    "<S> also shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 is the calculation which evolve the bhps calculation from the initial scale , @xmath105 gev , to @xmath106 gev@xmath47 , the largest @xmath46 scale reached by emc  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the intrinsic charm contents at the large @xmath8 ( @xmath107 ) region are drastically reduced when @xmath46 evolution is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 suggests that the most promising region to search for evidence of intrinsic charm could be at the somewhat lower @xmath8 region @xmath108 , rather than the largest @xmath8 region explored by previous experiments . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that we adopt the simple assumption that the initial scale is the same for all five - quark states . </S>",
    "<S> it is conceivable that the initial scale for intrinsic charm is significantly higher due to the larger mass of the charmed quark . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed curve shows the @xmath8 distribution of intrinsic @xmath104 at @xmath109 gev@xmath47 when the initial scale is set at @xmath110 gev , corresponding to the threshold of producing a pair of charmed quarks . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the shape of the intrinsic @xmath104 @xmath8 distribution becomes similar to that of the bhps model .     </S>",
    "<S> distributions based on the bhps model . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curve corresponds to the calculation using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : prob5q_a ] and the dashed and dotted curves are obtained by evolving the bhps result to @xmath109 gev@xmath47 using @xmath111 gev , and @xmath49 gev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the normalization is set at @xmath112.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in conclusion , we have generalized the existing bhps model to the light - quark sector and compared the calculation with the @xmath113 , @xmath3 , and @xmath90 data . </S>",
    "<S> the qualitative agreement between the data and the calculations provides strong support for the existence of the intrinsic @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 quark sea and the adequacy of the bhps model . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis also led to the determination of the probabilities for the five - quark fock states for the proton involving light quarks only . </S>",
    "<S> this result could guide future experimental searches for the intrinsic @xmath117 quark sea or even the intrinsic @xmath118 quark sea  @xcite , which could be relevant for the production of higgs boson at lhc energies  @xcite . </S>"
