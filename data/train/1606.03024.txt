    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are variable , non - nuclear x - ray sources in external galaxies with isotropic luminosities higher than @xmath4 erg / s , which exceeds the eddington limit for a typical stellar - mass black hole @xcite .",
    "there are two popular models to explain the ulx phenomenon .",
    "one involves intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) of @xmath5 with standard accretion discs @xcite ; the second model considers stellar - mass black holes ( @xmath6 ) accreting at super - eddington rates @xcite .",
    "x - ray studies of ulxs have shown that the behavior and shape of the spectra of these objects differ strongly from what is observed in galactic black holes .",
    "the often observed high - energy curvatures @xcite with a downturn between @xmath7 and @xmath8 kev in the x - ray spectra of ulxs suggest that the ulx accretion discs are not standard .",
    "the inner parts of the accretion discs may be obscured by a hot outflow or optically thick corona @xcite which comptonize radiation from the inner disc .",
    "observations of ulxs and their environment in the optical range provide additional information about the objects themselves , e.g. about the masses of their progenitor stars which turn out to be greater than 50 solar masses @xcite .",
    "observations of nebulae surrounding ulxs @xcite testify that they form due to jets or powerful winds . all ulxs identified in the optical range ( about 20 objects are identified reliably ) are faint sources with m@xmath9 @xcite , the brightest counterpart being ulx p13 in ngc7793 , m@xmath10 @xcite .    at present , the spectra of less than 10 optical counterparts of ulxs have been studied . @xcite",
    "have shown that optical spectra of ulxs contain broad emission lines of heii  @xmath11 and of hydrogen h@xmath12 and h@xmath13 with @xmath14 km / s .",
    "all the optical spectra turned out to be similar to each other ( see also @xcite ) , and to the spectra of wnlh - type stars @xcite and ss433 @xcite . in the mentioned paper",
    "it was also assumed that the studied ulxs represent a uniform class of objects that are probably supercritical accretion discs .",
    "recent spectroscopy of m81 uls-1 @xcite has shown , in addition to the broad heii , h@xmath15 , and h@xmath16 lines , the presence of blueshifted and redshifted h@xmath16 lines forming in baryonic relativistic jets .",

    "the background region was taken in a nearby area free of other sources .",
    "we found that the x - ray flux of ngc4395  ulx-1 varies from 0.008 to 0.05 cnt / s , which corresponds to the x - ray luminosities from @xmath63 to @xmath64  erg / s in a 0.310kev range .",

    "the detection of a broad heii line in the spectrum of the ngc4395 ulx-1 counterpart puts this object in line with the other ulxs and may indicate their identical nature .",
    "one may conclude that ulxs represent a roughly homogeneous class of objects , because the presence of a broad heii emission is rare in the optical spectra . in @xcite arguments",
    "have been made as to why this type of spectrum can not belong to a wr - type star .",
    "recently , an ultraluminous x - ray pulsar @xcite has been detected , reaching the x - ray luminosity of @xmath78 erg / s .",
    "obtaining the optical spectra of this object is an important task .",
    "the heii line in ngc4395 ulx-1 has a two - component profile ; the broad component was detected in only two spectra .",
    "the narrow component of the line is present in all three spectra ( fig.2 ) .",
    "it might be possible that the broad component of the heii line correlates with the x - ray light curve ( fig.3 ) ; in the fainter state the broad component disappears .",
    "the x - ray phase curve of ngc4395 ulx-1 may be connected to the precession of the supercritical disc .",
    "this is confirmed by the similarity of the phase curve and the precession curve of ss433 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "we did not detect a correlation between the object s optical brightness and the width of the heii line .",
    "however , we only have three spectral observations of ulx-1 , therefore the behavior of the broad component with the x - ray period phase should be confirmed by further observations .",
    "in fig.4 we find that the ulxs have a wide distribution of absolute magnitudes with a well - defined maximum at @xmath79 .",
    "the magnitudes of the optical counterparts of ngc4395 ulx-1 and ngc4559 x-10 are @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively ; they are also shown in the figure .",
    "the three brightest objects are ss433 , ngc7793 p-13 @xcite , and ngc6946 ulx-1 @xcite .",
    "other ulx counterparts in order of decreasing luminosity are : ngc4559 x-7 , ngc5408 x-1 , ngc5204 x-1 , m81 uls1 , holmbergii x-1 , ic342 x-1 , holmbergix x-1 , ngc1313 x-2 , ngc5474 x-1 , ngc1313 x-1 , m66 x-1 and m81 x-6 @xcite .",
    "note that the magnitudes of ngc4559 x-7 and ngc5204 x-1 were corrected for extinction ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively ) using our previous spectroscopy of the nearby nebulae @xcite .",
    "out of all the objects in the diagram , three ulx counterparts , ngc4559 x-10 , ngc5474 x-1 , and m66 x-1 @xcite have the cool spectra of f - g type supergiants , their absolute magnitudes being @xmath84 .",
    "other objects have power - law - like spectra .",
    "the abrupt decrease in the number of objects with decreasing @xmath85 can be related both to the effects of observational selection and to the physics of the objects themselves .    the first possibility is explained by the faintness of the objects , which makes it difficult to detect them in galaxies farther than 10 mpc .",
    "the second possibility can be related to the decrease in the luminosity of the supercritical disc wind as the original accretion rate @xmath86 decreases . as was shown by @xcite , the optical luminosity of supercritical discs",
    "is roughly @xmath87 , because stronger winds will reprocess more x - ray radiation emerging from the disc funnel . in the case of ulxs with the lowest optical luminosity",
    ", a considerable contribution to their luminosity can be made by donor stars .",
    "this is suggested by the cooler ( on average ) spectra of faint objects with @xmath84 .",
    "accordingly , as the luminosity of the supercritical disc wind decreases , the donor star becomes dominating .",
