    "if we consider the supernova explosion as a universal grb source , then the reported grb - supernova correlation implies that the high redshift grbs must be strongly beamed with the beam opening solid angle , which is approximately given by @xmath28    when we consider beaming , a broad luminosity range and a stringent constraint on the intrinsic energy are anticipated .",
    "@xcite considered the effect of the luminosity function due to the cylindrical - beam with the inhomogeneous distribution of grb sources on statistics of grbs .",
    "he analytically showed that the luminosity function follows a power law with the index @xmath29 in the very narrow beam model when @xmath8 .",

    "the @xmath3 value for this total sample is 0.3177 @xmath34 0.0102 .",
    "then we divide the selected sample into two subgroups according to the burst durations ( @xmath35 ) , which is motivated by the reported bimodal structure in grb durations @xcite .",

    "it agrees with the claim by tavani ( 1998 ) . according to @xcite ,",
    "bursts with long durations ( @xmath38 ) and hard spectra ( @xmath39 ) show the largest deviation from the so - called euclidean value .",

    "we consider the beaming - induced luminosity function following @xcite , where the relativistic beam has a constant cross - sectional area , i.e. a perfectly collimated cylindrical beam . under this circumstance ,",
    "a bulk motion of all the particles emitting the photons is parallel to the cone axis . in this case , the beam opening angle is irrelevant for the luminosity function .",

    "we calculate two statistical quantities using the beaming - induced luminosity function explained in this subsection .",
    "first , we calculate the @xmath3 as a function of threshold flux @xmath66 @xcite .",

    "after we obtain a set of @xmath66 , we calculate the @xmath3 for each threshold flux .",
    "the @xmath3 curve converges to 0.5 as @xmath66 increases sufficiently large .",
    "we convert flux to the number of bursts and plot @xmath3 as a function of the number of bursts for all bursts and long and short bursts in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) for @xmath8 ( thin lines ) and @xmath10 ( thick lines ) . the @xmath71 vs. number of bursts relation essentially gives the same information that one obtains from the conventional logn @xmath72 logp plot .",
    "our @xmath3 test does not include the threshold effect due to the detection efficiency .",
    "second , we calculate the fraction of grbs .",
    "we define the fraction of bursts located at a redshift larger than @xmath73 as @xmath74 in fig . 1 ( b )",
    ", we plot the fraction of bursts as a function of redshift for each burst subsample for the cylindrical - beam case with different number density distributions .      as a more realistic example",
    ", we adopt conically - beamed emission from grbs , which was studied by @xcite , and extended by @xcite .",
    "we consider the luminosity function produced using three different opening angles , i.e. @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "we calculate @xmath3 and the @xmath15 for each subgroup with the derived luminosity function .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor is set to be 100 .",
    "according to @xcite , the probability that we observe the bright bursts rapidly increases as the opening angle increases , while relatively dim bursts are not as detectable as brighter ones .",
    "therefore , as the opening angle increases , the derived luminosity function becomes similar to that of the standard candle case , in which all bursts have the same maximum luminosity given by this luminosity function .",
    "when the opening angle is small @xmath77 , the luminosity function gives the same result as the cylindrical beaming case . using this luminosity function",
    ", we calculate the same statistics as we did in previous subsection .",
    "results are shown in figs . 2 - 5 for @xmath8 ( thin lines ) and @xmath10 ( thick lines ) in the cases of each sample .",
    "the left panels in figs . 1 - 5 ( a ) show the @xmath78 as a function of the number of bursts .",
    "we show results obtained from different luminosity distributions and number density distributions .",
    "the thin lines in fig . 1 - 4 represent the results obtained with @xmath8 and thick lines @xmath10 . in figs . 1 - 4",
    ", we assume that the sfr - motivated number density distribution , which is flat beyond a redshift larger than the critical redshift , @xmath51 .",
    "finally , we show our results obtained with the sfr - motivated number density distribution , which gradually decreases and @xmath8 in fig . 5 ( a ) .",
    "in all cases , we assume that n(z ) rapidly increases if @xmath79 .",
    "the dotted lines represent the observed @xmath3 curves with the @xmath80 bound .",
    "the solid lines indicate the theoretical results derived from our luminosity functions with the sfr - motivated number density distribution of grb sources .",
    "we plot the results obtained for the luminosity functions with the uniform distribution of burst sources as dashed lines , for comparaison .",
    "apparently all the luminosity functions we have studied satisfy the observed @xmath3 curve at the 3@xmath81 significance level . although the number density distribution of grb sources is believed to correlate with the sfr , we can not rule out the uniform distribution of burst sources in this analysis ( see also krumholz et al . 1998 ) .    the right panels in figs . 1 - 5 ( b ) show @xmath82 in terms of @xmath83 .",
    "the y - axis corresponds to the fraction of bursts which have redshifts larger than a certain redshift @xmath83 .",
    "solid lines result from the sfr - motivated number density distribution for the spatial distribution of grbs and dashed lines the uniform distribution . filled squares in figs . 1 , 3 , and 5 ( b )",
    "locate the known redshifts of 15 observed grbs so far .",
    "the redshift values are quoted from http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/batse/counterparts/grb_table.html .",
    "we compare the observed redshift values only with the long subsample because all grbs with the known redshifts belong to the long bursts .",
    "it is interesting to note that , if we assume @xmath8 , a large fraction of grbs are distributed at high redshifts , provided that grbs are assumed to follow the sfr , regardless of specific beaming models .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath10 , @xmath6 is significantly reduced , though it still remains quite large .",
    "the fraction for @xmath84 at @xmath85 for a cylindrical - beam case is @xmath86 for long and total samples when @xmath8 .",
    "this is too large a value given the fact that the observed grbs with such high redshifts account for @xmath87 of the total bursts .",
    "this fraction become @xmath88 when @xmath10 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , though their @xmath3 value is close to a euclidean value , most of the short bursts are distributed at high redshifts in the case of @xmath8 .",
    "when we assume that the long bursts are uniformly distributed in space , the @xmath6 estimate for the broad beaming can not explain the largest observed redshift in both cases of @xmath8 and 2.0 .",
    "our study is based on an assumption that all grbs have the same intrinsic luminosity and they are all beamed . because the @xmath3 test is not sufficiently sensitive to the observed data , different luminosity functions are essentially indistinguishable .",
    "if there is an intrinsic luminosity function and the degree of beaming of grbs is moderate , we may obtain results similar to what we have presented in this study .",
    "if all grbs are highly beamed and their sources follow a sfr - like distribution , the maximum detectable redshift becomes very large , even in the case that the observed @xmath3 is sufficiently close to the euclidean value , i.e. , @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to rule out a possibility that the apparent euclidean value of @xmath90 may be due to the luminosity function , for instance , induced by beaming . in other words , the so - called euclidean value may have nothing to do with the euclidean distribution .",
    "if the total burst sample is a mixture of broad ( or nearly non - beamed ) beams and narrow beams , the exact fraction of the strongly beamed bursts may affect the burst rate estimate significantly .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper .    for a given lorentz factor ,",
    "the range of the derived beamed luminosity distribution becomes broader as the beam opening angle decreases .",
    "we obtain @xmath91 in the cylindrical - beam case .",
    "however , in the case of broad beaming , @xmath92 becomes substantially smaller .",
    "this is only an effective range because the cut - off for the minimum luminosity given by the conic beam is rather loosely constrained .",
    "it is obvious that the luminosity range decreases when the opening angle increases for a fixed lorentz factor .",
    "this is simply explained as follows : assuming that we observe a beamed emission with an opening angle @xmath93 , if we define @xmath94 as an angle between the line of sight and the symmetry axis of the conic beam , we can observe the beamed emission only within a certain range of @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "for instance ,",
    "when @xmath96 , @xmath97 is approximately @xmath93 .",
    "for a given lorentz factor , @xmath95 increases as the opening angle of cone becomes larger .",
    "the apparent luminosity range from a broad beam would decrease gradually with @xmath94 , and in the extreme case , the isotropic radiation would have constant luminosity regardless of @xmath94 . however , when @xmath93 is very small , the apparent luminosity rapidly decreases with @xmath94 , and the derived luminosity range is narrower than a broad - beam case .",
    "we have demonstrated that the beaming - induced luminosity function may explain the statistics of the observed grbs . in the case of the cylindrically beamed luminosity function , we determined the intrinsic luminosity @xmath53 by the @xmath3 test for each subsample . in all cases , the intrinsic luminosity is much smaller than that of non - beamed luminosity functions , i.e. @xmath98 . the maximum luminosity obtained from our luminosity functions , in both the cylindrical - beam and the conic - beam cases , is @xmath99 .",
    "this is compatible with the required value for isotropic radiation .",
    "the ratio between the maximum luminosity for the long bursts and that for the short bursts @xmath100 is @xmath101 for the narrow beam and @xmath11 for the broad beam , respectively .",
    "this implies that these two subgroups may have two different intrinsic luminosities , and hence probably two different origin .",
    "the obtained @xmath6 in the cylindrical - beam case are @xmath102 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath103 ( @xmath10 ) for the total selected sample , and long and short subgroup , respectively .",
    "the obtained @xmath6 in the broader beam case ( i.e. @xmath104 ) are @xmath105 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath106 ( @xmath10 ) for the total selected sample , and long and short subgroup , respectively .",
    "the maximum known redshift we consider , @xmath107 , is estimated for grb971214 . however",
    ", even a larger value of @xmath108 is suggested for grb980329 ( http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/batse/counterparts/grb@xmath109table.html ) . without any detailed information on the redshift distribution of grbs ,",
    "the maximum redshift gives a rather strong constraint on the ratio between the lorentz factor and the opening angle @xmath93 .",
    "for the conic beam case , the luminosity function derived for the narrow opening angle seems to fit the @xmath3 curve better .    from this simple analysis",
    "we have carried out , we have shown that the beaming - induced luminosity function may account for the basic statistical properties of the observed grbs .",
    "the apparent euclidean distribution of grbs may be an indication of the presence of the grb luminosity function .",
    "although it is the beyond the scope of this work , it is interesting to point out that there could be a potentially observable correlation between spectral hardness and luminosity since the most doppler - boosted burst would probe the hardest part of the spectrum .",
    "any wide scatters in intrinsic spectral shapes would make the detection of this correlation complicated .",
