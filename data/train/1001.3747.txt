    "this kind of phase transition has also been studied by perturbative treatment @xcite .",

    "is identical to the classical sk model and with @xmath16 and @xmath18 it is the lriaf model .    for an analytic ( mean field ) study of the model we define an effective magnetic field @xmath19 at each site , which is a resultant of the average cooperation enforcement in the @xmath10-direction and the applied transverse field in the @xmath9-direction , so that the above hamiltonian can be written as , + h = _ eff._i=1^n _ i , where _ i = ^z_i + ^x_i , and    @xmath20    this replacement of @xmath21 by its average value @xmath22 in @xmath23 should be valid for this infinite range model ( see appendix a for its much more precise description under replica symmetric theory ) .",

    "however , at any finite temperature the entropy term coming from the extreme degeneracy of the antiferromagnetically ordered state and the close - by excited states does not seem to induce a stability of this phase .",

    "first , let us consider the case of pure lriaf model and rewrite our hamiltonian @xmath38 in eq.(1 ) for @xmath136 as @xmath200 if we now denote the total spin by @xmath201 i.e. @xmath202 ( where @xmath203 ) , then the hamiltonian @xmath38 can be expressed as @xmath204 let us assume the average total spin @xmath205 to be oriented at an angle @xmath206 with the @xmath10-direction : @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",

    "as observed in our monte carlo study in the previous section , @xmath218 as @xmath219 .",
    "this is consistent with this exact result @xmath220 at @xmath217 . for @xmath217 ( and @xmath33 ) , therefore , the transition from antiferromagnetic ( @xmath221 ) to para ( @xmath222 ) phase , driven by the transverse field @xmath6 , occurs at @xmath46 itself .",
    "one can also calculate the susceptibility @xmath70 at @xmath223 . here",
    "@xmath224 and the minimisation of this energy gives @xmath225 giving the ( longitudinal ) susceptibility @xmath226 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed behaviour of @xmath70 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : inset5 ] where the extrapolated value of @xmath70 at @xmath46 increases with decreasing @xmath122 and approaches @xmath227 as @xmath219 .    at finite temperatures @xmath228 , for @xmath33",
    ", we have to consider also the entropy term and minimise the free energy @xmath229 rather than @xmath211 where @xmath230 denotes the entropy of the state .",
    "this entropy term will also take part in fixing the value of @xmath206 and @xmath81 at which the free energy @xmath231 is minimised .",
    "as soon as the temperature @xmath122 becomes non - zero , the extensive entropy of the system for antiferromagnetically ordered state with @xmath232 ( around and close - by excited states with @xmath212 ) helps stabilisation near @xmath212 and @xmath213 rather than near the para phase with @xmath215 and @xmath216 , where the entropy drops to zero .",
    "while the transverse field tends to align the spins along @xmath9 direction ( inducing @xmath215 and @xmath216 ) , the entropy factor prohibits that and the system adjusts @xmath206 and @xmath81 values accordingly and they do not take the disordered or para state values ( @xmath215 and @xmath216 ) for any non - zero value of @xmath6 ( like at @xmath217 ) . for very large values of @xmath6 , of course , the free energy @xmath231 is practically dominated by the transverse field term in @xmath38 and again @xmath215 and @xmath216 , beyond @xmath233 for @xmath234 .",
    "however , this continuous transition - like behaviour may be argued @xcite to correspond to a crossover type property of the model at finite temperatures ( suggesting that the observed finite values of @xmath235 are only effective numerical values ) .",
    "in fact , for @xmath33 one adds the entropy term @xmath236 , where @xmath237 is the degeneracy for getting total spin @xmath238 @xcite , d = - to @xmath211 in eq.(a3 ) to get @xmath231 and one can then get , after minimising the @xmath231 with respect to @xmath81 and @xmath206 , @xmath239 , which indicates an analytic variation of @xmath81 and no phase transition at any finite temperature for @xmath136 ( antiferromagnetic phase occurs only at @xmath240 and @xmath241 as shown in fig .
