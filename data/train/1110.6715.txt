    "recent studies of electron and spin - excitation spectra using angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) and inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) have revealed an important role of antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin excitations in the `` kink '' phenomenon and the @xmath4-wave pairing in cuprates . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite quantitative analysis of the af spin - excitation spectrum measured by ins and of arpes data for the spin - fermion coupling of the same yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 ( ybco@xmath8 ) crystal were used for numerical solution of the eliashberg - type equations .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature was found to exceed @xmath9  k.    the main argument against the spin - fluctuation pairing mechanism , a weak intensity of spin fluctuations at the optimal doping seen in ins experiments  @xcite , was dismissed in recent resonant inelastic x - ray scattering  @xcite . in a large family of cuprates",
    "paramagnon af excitations with dispersions and spectral weights similar to those of magnons in undoped cuprates were found . a numerical solution of the eliashberg equations for the magnetic spectrum found in ybco@xmath10 and for the electron - spin interaction described by the @xmath0@xmath1 model results in @xmath11  k.",
    "these calculations based on experimental data demonstrate that spin fluctuations have sufficient strength to mediate high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates and , therefore , alternative mechanism based on electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) seems to play a secondary role in cuprate superconductivity .",

    "the dss ( [ b2 ] ) reveals a pronounced resonance mode ( rm ) at low temperatures due to a strong suppression of the damping of spin excitations .",

    "plays a dominant role in limiting the decay of the rm in comparison with the superconducting gap in the particle - hole excitation .",
