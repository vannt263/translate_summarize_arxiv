    "nanoscale structures in the form of photonic and phononic crystals have recently been shown to feature significant radiation pressure interactions between localized optical cavity modes and internal nanomechanical resonances  @xcite . alongside similar advances in the microwave domain  @xcite , optomechanical crystals",
    "have recently been used to laser cool a nanomechanical oscillator to its quantum ground state  @xcite . the ability to measure and control the quantum state of such",
    "an object ultimately hinges on the quantum efficiency of the optical transduction of motion .",
    "here we demonstrate high - efficiency optical coupling between an optomechanical zipper cavity  @xcite and a permanently mounted optical fiber through adiabatic mode conversion .",
    "this optical coupling technique greatly improves the collection efficiency of light from these types of optomechanical cavities over existing methods , and brings the minimum total added measurement noise to within a factor of @xmath5 of the standard - quantum - limit of continuous position measurement .    in a weak measurement of position through a parametrically",
    "coupled optical cavity there are two intrinsic sources of measurement noise .",
    "shot noise of the probe laser and excess quantum vacuum noise due to optical signal loss set the fundamental noise floor of the measurement .",
    "when converted into units of mechanical quanta this imprecision noise @xmath6 decreases with increasing probe power .",
    "however , higher laser probe power comes at the cost of radiation pressure backaction driving an additional occupation noise @xmath7 on top of the thermal mode occupation @xmath8 . for an optically resonant measurement of position , the noise terms in units of mechanical occupation quanta are @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the optomechanical interaction rate , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the optical and mechanical loss rates , @xmath13 is the extrinsic cavity loss rate , @xmath14 is the optical efficiency between the cavity and the detection channel , and @xmath15 accounts for excess technical noise and signal loss accumulated in experiment - specific optical components .",
    "as intracavity photon number @xmath16 is varied , an optimal input power @xmath17 is reached where the imprecision noise and back - action noises are equal and the total added noise is minimized to @xmath18    in the ideal case this point , known as the standard - quantum - limit ( sql ) , adds @xmath19 quanta of noise to the measurement , equal to the zero - point fluctuations of the oscillator  @xcite .",
    "the sql can only be reached in the limit of noise - free , lossless detection ( @xmath20 ) and perfect waveguide loading ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath22 is a suitable figure of merit for the ultimate quantum efficiency of an optomechanical detector of position .",
    "although experiments in both the optical and microwave domains have brought the imprecision noise level down to below @xmath23 quanta  @xcite , and recent microwave experiments have acheived total added noise within a factor of @xmath24 of the sql  @xcite , current state - of - the - art optical devices have been limited to @xmath25 times the sql  @xcite .",
    "such experiments are limited partly by technical noise ( e.g. added noise from amplifiers ) , but a substantial amount of imprecision is introduced by poor quantum efficiency of the optical readout . here",
    "we identify another figure of merit to allow for cross - platform comparison of detection methods .",
    "the quantum efficiency of a general measurement apparatus will be limited to @xmath26 , the collection efficiency of intracavity photons into the detection channel before further signal processing .    to date",
    ", most nanoscale optomechanical experiments utilize evanescent coupling between the optical cavity and an adiabatically tapered optical fiber  @xcite .",
    "while this method offers low parasitic losses , standing wave resonators such as the optomechanical cavities considered here radiate symmetrically into two oppositely propagating modes of the fiber , each at a rate @xmath13 .",
    "thus the fraction of @xmath16 routed into the detection channel @xmath27 does not exceed @xmath19 even in the ideal case of negligible intrinsic cavity loss rate @xmath28 . to reach the overcoupled regime @xmath29 ,",
    "a single - sided coupling scheme is necessary .",
    "we have implemented a coupling scheme which routes light from a photonic crystal zipper cavity to a cleaved single - mode optical fiber tip with high efficiency in a fully single - sided interface .",
    "the fiber is self - aligned in a si v - groove ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_1 ] ) , secured with epoxy , and butt - coupled to a mode - matched si@xmath30n@xmath31 waveguide , which adiabatically widens  @xcite to match the width of the zipper cavity nanobeam .",
    "the waveguide then couples to the cavity through a truncated photonic crystal mirror .",
    "the robust fiber alignment offers another key advantage over evanescent and grating - coupler techniques that call for nanometer - scale - sensitive positioning to achieve appreciable mode overlap .",
    "nano - positioning is difficult and expensive to implement in cryogenic setups due to footprint and imaging requirements , whereas the coupler presented here can be installed directly into any system with a fiber port .",
    "we now describe the optimization of the optical efficiency . to determine the optimal width of the si@xmath30n@xmath31 waveguide , we compute the guided transverse modes of both the waveguide and the optical fiber at the target wavelength of @xmath32 nm using a finite - element - method ( fem ) solver  @xcite .",
    "the coupling efficiency at the fiber - waveguide junction is calculated from the mode profiles using a mode overlap integral  @xcite . for a @xmath33 nm thick si@xmath30n@xmath31 membrane , the optimal waveguide width is @xmath34 nm with a transmission efficiency of @xmath35 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_1]c .",
    "then @xmath36 increases gradually to the nanobeam width of @xmath37 nm . to obtain high transmission efficiency in this tapered waveguide section",
    ", the rate of change of @xmath36 along the propagation direction @xmath38 must be small enough to satisfy the adiabatic condition  @xcite @xmath39 at every point along the taper , where @xmath40 is the difference in effective index between the fundamental waveguide mode and any other guided or radiation mode .",
    "the actual transmission efficiency is calculated using a finite - difference - time - domain ( fdtd ) simulation  @xcite . for a @xmath41 m",
    "long taper with a cubic shape between the junctions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_1]c , d , we obtain a transmission efficiency of @xmath42 .",
    "the tapered waveguide is supported by a @xmath43 nm wide tether placed near the fiber - waveguide junction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_1]c ) .",
    "the scattering loss of the tether is computed using fdtd and the transmission efficiency is calculated to be @xmath44 . a second set of @xmath45 nm wide tethers ( fig . [ fig : fig_1]d ) is placed just before the cavity , in order to isolate the optomechanical crystal from the low - frequency vibrational modes of the tapered waveguide .",
    "the waveguide is temporarily widened to @xmath46 m at this point , rendering the scattering loss due to the tethers negligible .    finally , the uniform dielectric waveguide adiabatically transitions into a one - dimensional photonic crystal mirror by linearly increasing the radius of the holes while keeping the lattice constant fixed . an @xmath47 hole photonic crystal taper ( fig [ fig : fig_1]e ) is sufficient to acheive an efficiency of @xmath48 . the coupling rate to the cavity is controlled by varying the number of mirror periods after the taper . the photonic crystal cavity mode ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_1]f ) is shared between the waveguide beam and a near - field , flexibly supported test beam , with the optomechanical coupling arising from the sensitivity of the resonance frequency to the beam separation . in this manner",
    "the waveguide structure serves as an optical readout of the test beam motion with an optimal round - trip efficiency of @xmath49 . for the purposes of optomechanical transduction",
    ", the relevant figure is the single - pass transmission efficiency between the cavity output and the fiber , which ideally is @xmath50 .",
    "a broadband scan of the reflection from the fiber - coupled device is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : fig_2]a . for probe wavelengths",
    "detuned from cavity resonances , the photonic crystal depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_1]d , e functions as a near - unity reflectivity mirror .",
    "thus a low - finesse fabry - perot cavity is formed in the waveguide between the photonic crystal and the cleaved fiber facet ( with reflectivity @xmath51 ) of fig [ fig : fig_1]b . by fitting the visibility of the fringes to @xmath52 , the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_2]a provides a convenient calibration of optical efficiency , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_2]b versus wavelength and reveals @xmath53 for resonant measurements of the primary mode at @xmath54 nm . the coupling depth of the mode is determined by fitting the resonance dip to a coupled - cavity model incorporating the photonic crystal and fabry - perot interference effects , yielding @xmath55 . to verify this model , we study a series of devices with varying numbers of mirror - type holes between the photonic crystal taper and cavity . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_2]c , the total optical quality factor ( @xmath56 ) is plotted in green alongside intrinsic ( @xmath57 ) and extrinsic ( @xmath58 ) components as determined by the coupled cavity fit ( blue and red points respectively ) .",
    "as the mirror holes are removed , @xmath58 decreases in good agreement with simulation ( dotted line ) , and the limiting component of @xmath56 transitions from @xmath57 to @xmath58 . by converting quality factor into loss rate and calculating the coupling depth of the device series , a clear trend from undercoupling to overcoupling is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_2]d .",
    "the device under test in this work features @xmath55 , bringing the fiber collection efficiency figure of merit to @xmath59 . for comparison , systems in which ground - state occupancy of a single mechanical mode has been achieved",
    "have featured @xmath60  @xcite and @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "to extract the noise power spectral density ( npsd ) of the test - beam displacement @xmath62 from the optomechanically phase - shifted cavity reflection , we place the device in an evacuated environment and connect the output fiber to the signal arm of a fiber - based balanced homodyne receiver shown schematically in fig [ fig : fig_3 ] .",
    "we resonantly probe the optical resonance to avoid dynamic back - action on the test beam as well as to maximize the mechanical transduction sensitivity .",
    "the probe laser frequency is positioned on resonance without frequency - locking to the cavity as drift is found to be negligibile over the time span of the measurement ( @xmath63 s ) .",
    "the laser output is sent through a fiber polarization controller ( fpc ) and variable optical attenuator ( voa ) before being split by a variable beam splitter ( vbs1 ) into into the signal and local oscillator ( lo ) arms of the homodyne receiver .",
    "the signal circulates through the device , while the lo propagates through a fiber stretcher ( fs ) before recombining with the signal at vbs2 , with the interference output detected on a balanced photodiode ( bpd ) pair .",
    "the difference signal generated by the bpd is dediplexed at @xmath64 khz into a low - frequency lock signal ( fed back through a proportional - integral - derivative ( pid ) controller onto the fs to eliminate path - length fluctuations in the interferometer ) and a high - frequency photocurrent response .",
    "the npsd of this high - frequency signal , @xmath65 , is measured on an electronic spectrum analyzer ( esa ) and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_4 ] for a probe power of @xmath66 nw . the optical efficiency of the setup to the device reflection signal is set by the transmission through the circulator ( @xmath67 ) and vbs2 ( @xmath68 ) as well as the bpd quantum efficiency ( @xmath69 ) , which combine to @xmath70 .    the npsd shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_4 ] reveals a prominent resonance at @xmath71 mhz , which is identified using fem simulations as the fundamental in - plane mechanical mode of the test beam .",
    "the optomechanical coupling rate of this mode , calibrated through the optical spring shift  @xcite , is @xmath72 khz . a second prominent resonance exists at @xmath73 mhz which is identified as the fundamental in - plane mechanical mode of the waveguide with a lower optomechanical coupling ( @xmath74 khz ) owing to small overlap between the mechanical and optical modes .",
    "overlays of the predicted single - sided transduction spectra , calculated using the measured parameters of the optomechanical cavity and fiber coupler , show good agreement with the measured signal for both the test - beam ( dashed green curve ) and the waveguide ( dashed red curve ) .",
    "other peaks at @xmath5 mhz , @xmath75 mhz , and @xmath76 mhz do not correspond to any real mechanical motion of the beam but rather are due to nonlinear transduction of the mechanics .",
    "thermal brownian motion of the beams , combined with the large optomechanical coupling , gives rise to a frequency shift of the optical mode which is a substantial fraction of the cavity optical linewidth , leading to harmonics in @xmath65 at multiples of the sum and difference frequencies of the two mechanical modes  @xcite .",
    "the remaining small features in @xmath65 are due to out - of - plane flexural modes of the structure , which are weakly transduced due to imperfect vertical symmetry .",
    "for the remainder of the paper we focus our discussion on measurement of the mechanical mode with the strongest transduction , the fundamental in - plane mode of the test beam with mechanical frequency @xmath77 mhz .",
    "the single - sided npsd of displacement for a harmonic mechanical mode at the mechanical resonance frequency is given by @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the zero - point amplitude of the mechanical resonator with effective motional mass @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is the mode occupancy in units of phonon quanta . for the fundamental in - plane mode we numerically compute an effective mass of @xmath82 pg and a corresponding zero - point amplitude of @xmath83 fm .",
    "when the mechanical mode is well - resolved in @xmath65 , that is , when the contributions of nearby mechanical modes are negligible and the resolution bandwidth of the esa is much less than @xmath12 , we can convert the spectrum into units of displacement for the measured mechanical mode by scaling @xmath84 to the computed value of @xmath85 .",
    "we determine the imprecision in units of quanta for a measurement of this mechanical mode by referencing the measured background level to the height of the measured noise peak .",
    "that is , the number of imprecision quanta is equal to @xmath86 divided by the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the resolved mechanical noise peak to the imprecision noise floor , so that an imprecision level of @xmath87 corresponds to the equivalent level of npsd that would be produced at the mechanical mode noise peak by a single quantum in the mechanical resonator  @xcite . to determine the background noise floor we take the average of @xmath65 from @xmath88 mhz , indicated by relatively noise - free spectral region shaded gray in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_5]a .        to directly measure the additional phonon occupation due to back - action",
    "it is necessary to determine the total phonon occupancy , @xmath89 , by integrating over the full bandwidth of the mechanical mode .",
    "however , such a study is outside the scope of the work presented here , as the large thermal occupation at room temperature ( @xmath90 ) dominates the signal over the comparatively small back - action , @xmath7 , produced by reasonable laser probe powers .",
    "for now we restrict our attention to measuring the imprecision , and assume that the backaction is due only to the ideal radiation pressure term given in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : noise ] .",
    "this assumption is supported by measurements of the properties of known noise sources such as technical laser noise   rad@xmath91 hz in the frequency range of interest .",
    "consequently , for the probe powers used in this work , the excess back - action due to technical laser noise is negligible , and the phase noise contribution to the noise floor lies roughly @xmath92 db below the shot noise . ] , which is a common concern in optomechanical systems  @xcite .",
    "as there may exist additional , unknown sources of excess back - action in our measurement , we emphasize that the main result of this work is the collection efficiency of the coupling scheme , and that back - action and noise - driven occupation levels are used only to compare the ideal quantum limits of the device to the sql .    by measuring the spectrum exemplified in fig [ fig : fig_4 ] for a range of probe powers",
    "we observe the power dependence of @xmath6 , plotted in fig [ fig : fig_5]b with calculations of imprecision ( solid blue ) , ideal quantum back - action ( solid red ) , and total ( solid green ) noise quanta .",
    "losses in the optical circuit set @xmath70 , which combined with @xmath93 and electronic noise brings the imprecision level of the measurement to @xmath3 times the ideal imprecision of a lossless device ( dashed blue curve ) .",
    "the predicted total minimum added noise is thus @xmath94 phonons .",
    "this minimum total added noise can be compared to similar measurements of mechanical position performed in the optical  @xcite and microwave  @xcite domains .",
    "the coupling scheme here compares favorably to the minimum total added noise of @xmath95 demonstrated with whispering - gallery - mode resonators  @xcite , @xmath96 demonstrated with membranes in fabry - perot cavities @xcite , and @xmath97 demonstrated with microwave resonators  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can compare to state - of - the - art ground state cooling experiments  @xcite where the occupation of the mechanical resonator is brought near or below a single phonon and the quantum limits of the mechanical measurement become crucial .",
    "in such experiments the back - action is used to passively cool the mechanical resonator , and thus the relevant noise term is simply @xmath6 . in the red - detuned ,",
    "sideband resolved regime relevant for ground - state cooling , the imprecision can not be made arbitrarily small by increasing the power , but rather has the asymptotic form @xmath98 in the limit of large intracavity photon number .",
    "our coupling scheme allows us to achieve @xmath99 , which lies well below the imprecision level previously demonstrated using similar nanoscale optomechanical cavties ( @xmath100 ) @xcite , and is comparable to the imprecision acheived in whispering - gallery - mode resonators ( @xmath101 ) @xcite and microwave resonators ( @xmath102 ) @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that improvements to @xmath15 of the optical circuit such as higher efficiency photodiodes can lower @xmath22 to below @xmath103 quantum .",
    "in addition to improving the collection efficiency towards the theoretical maximum of @xmath104 , further work will focus on measuring the back - action exerted on the resonator by placing the device in suitable cryogenic conditions where the thermal occupation is strongly suppressed .",
    "another key application which benefits greatly from the improved collection efficiency demonstrated here is feedback damping of the mechanical motion  @xcite , which is fundamentally limited by the imprecision noise and could enable ground state cooling of sideband unresolved mechanical systems such as the zipper cavity .",
