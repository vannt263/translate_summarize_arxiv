    "we consider the problem of dynamical localization of waves in a nonlinear schrdinger model with random potential on a lattice and arbitrary power nonlinearity , @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is a real number ; @xmath3 is the hamiltonian of a linear problem in the tight binding approximation ; @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) characterizes the strength of nonlinearity ; on - site energies @xmath6 are randomly distributed with zero mean across a finite energy range ; @xmath7 is hopping matrix element ; and the total probability is normalized to @xmath8 . for @xmath9 , the model in eqs .",
    "( [ 1s ] ) and  ( [ 2 ] ) reduces to the original anderson model in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the absence of randomness , the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) in eq .",
    "( [ 1s ] ) is completely integrable .",
    "experimentally , anderson localization has been reported for electron gases @xcite , acoustic waves @xcite , light waves @xcite , and matter waves in a controlled disorder @xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed that the phenomena of anderson localization are based on interference between multiple scattering paths , leading to localized wave functions with exponentially decaying profiles and dense eigenspectrum @xcite .",
    "theoretically , nonlinear schrdinger models offer a mean - field approximation , where the nonlinear term containing @xmath10 absorbs the interactions between the components of the wave field .",
    "it has been discussed by a few authors @xcite that nlse with quadratic nonlinearity ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) observes a localization - delocalization transition above a certain critical strength of nonlinear interaction .",
    "that means that the localized state is destroyed , and the nonlinear field can spread across the lattice despite the underlying disorder , provided just that the @xmath4 value exceeds a maximal allowed value . below the delocalization border",
    ", the field is dynamically localized similarly to the linear case .",
    "a generalization of this result to super - quadratic nonlinearity , with @xmath12 , is far from trivial . in a recent investigation of nlse with disorder ,",
    "we have shown @xcite that the critical strength destroying localization is only preserved through dynamics , if @xmath11 . for @xmath12 ( and similarly for @xmath13 ,",
    "a regime not considered here ) , the critical strength is dynamic in that it involves a dependence on the number of already excited modes ( the latter are the exponentially localized modes of the linear disordered lattice ) . if the field is spread across @xmath14 states , then the conservation of the probability implies that @xmath15 .",
    "as the number of already excited modes is proportional to @xmath16 , the distance between the frequencies obeys @xmath17 ; whereas the nonlinear frequency shift varies as @xmath18 .",
    "hence @xmath19 is only independent of @xmath16 , if the nonlinearity is quadratic , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "the implication is that the effect of quadratic nonlinearity does not depend on the range of field distribution ; but the effect of super - quadratic ( as well as sub - quadratic , with @xmath13 ) power nonlinearity does .",
    "hence , if initial behavior is chaotic , say , chaos remains while spreading only for @xmath20 . for @xmath12 , a transition to regularity",
    "occurs , which blocks spreading in vicinity of the criticality beyond a certain limiting number of excited modes @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "one sees that quadratic nonlinearity , characterized by @xmath20 , plays a dynamically very distinguished role in that it is the only type of power nonlinearity permitting an abrupt localization - delocalization transition with unlimited spreading of the wave field already at the delocalization border .",
    "this localization - delocalization transition bears signatures , enabling to associate it with a percolation transition on the infinite cayley tree ( bethe lattice ) @xcite .",
    "the main idea here is that delocalization occurs through infinite clusters of chaotic states on a bethe lattice , with occupancy probabilities decided by the strength of nonlinear interaction .",
    "then the percolation transition threshold can be translated into a critical value of the nonlinearity control parameter , such that above this value the field spreads to infinity , and is dynamically localized in spite of these nonlinearities otherwise .",
    "this critical value when account is taken for hierarchical geometry of the cayley tree is found to be @xmath23 @xcite , a fancy number representing the topology of nonlinear interaction posed by the quadratic power term .",
    "it was argued based on a random walk approach that in vicinity of the criticality the spreading of the wave field is subdiffusive in the limit @xmath24 , and that the second moments grow with time as a power law @xmath25 with @xmath26 exactly .",
    "this critical regime is modeled as a next - neighbor random walk at the onset of percolation on a cayley tree .",
    "the phenomena of critical spreading find their significance in some connection with the general problem @xcite of transport along separatrices of dynamical systems with many degrees of freedom and are mathematically related to a description @xcite in terms of hamiltonian pseudochaos ( random non - chaotic dynamics with zero lyapunov exponents ) @xcite and time - fractional diffusion equations .",
    "for @xmath12 , the phenomena of field spreading are limited to finite clusters at the onset of delocalization @xcite .",
    "mathematically , this regime of field spreading is complicated by the fact that finiteness of clusters on which the transport processes concentrate conflicts with the assumptions of threshold percolation , breaking the universal scaling laws @xcite which pertain to the infinite clusters .",
    "it is not clear , therefore , how to predict and explain transport on finite clusters , avoiding as the conceptual key element the use of percolation , and what the ensuing transport laws would be .",
    "the goal of the present study is to present a general solution to this problem .",
    "the approach , which we advocate , is based on topological methods and in a sketchy form comprises three basic steps explored in sec .",
    "ii :    step 1 : enabling an equivalent reduced dynamical model of field - spreading based on backbone map .",
    "step 2 : projecting dynamical equations on a cayley tree with appropriately large coordination number which accommodates the power nonlinearity @xmath1 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "step 3 : calculating the index of anomalous diffusion based on combinatorial arguments , using a triangulation procedure in the mapping space and the notion of one - bond - connected ( obc ) polyhedron .",
    "it is shown in sec .",
    "iii that the transport on finite clusters is subdiffusive with a power law memory kernel ( for time scales for which the dynamics concentrate on a self - similar geometry ) and pertains to a class of non - markovian transport processes described by generalized diffusion equations with the fractional derivative in time .",
    "we summarize our findings in sec .",
    "expanding @xmath28 over a basis of linearly localized modes , the eigenfunctions of the linear problem , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , we write , with time depending complex coefficients @xmath31 , @xmath32 we consider @xmath28 , @xmath33 , as a vector in functional space whose basis vectors @xmath34 are the anderson eigenstates . for strong disorder , dimensionality of this space",
    "is infinite ( countable ) .",
    "it is convenient to think of each node @xmath35 as comprising a countable number of  compactified \" dimensions representing the components of the wave field .",
    "so these hidden dimensions when account is taken for eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) are  expanded \" via a topological mapping procedure to form the functional space @xmath36 .",
    "we consider this space as providing the embedding space for dynamics .",
    "further , given any two vectors @xmath33 and @xmath37 , we define the inner product , @xmath38 , @xmath39 where star denotes complex conjugate . to this end ,",
    "the functional space @xmath36 becomes a hilbert space , permitting the notions of length , angle , and orthogonality by standard methods @xcite . with these implications in mind ,",
    "we consider the functions @xmath34 as  orthogonal \" basis vectors obeying @xmath40 where @xmath41 is kronecker s delta .",
    "then the total probability being equal to 1 implies @xmath42      we define the power @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) of the modulus of the wave field as the power @xmath1 of the probability density , i.e. , @xmath45^s$ ] .",
    "then in the basis of linear localized modes we can write , with the use of @xmath46 , @xmath47^s .",
    "\\label{2s } % eq.~(\\ref{2s})\\ ] ] it is convenient to consider the expression on the right - hand side as a functional map @xmath48^s \\label{3s } % eq.~(\\ref{3s})\\ ] ] from the vector field @xmath29 into the scalar field @xmath10 .",
    "it is noticed that the map in eq .",
    "( [ 3s ] ) is positive definite , and that it contains a self - similarity character in it , such that by stretching the basis vectors ( by a stretch factor @xmath49 ) the value of @xmath50 is just renormalized ( multiplied by @xmath51 ) .",
    "we have , accordingly , @xmath52 consider expanding the power law on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 2s ] ) .",
    "if @xmath1 is a positive integer , then a regular expansion can be obtained as a sum over @xmath1 pairs of indices @xmath53 .",
    "the result is a homogeneous polynomial , an @xmath1-quadratic form @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for fractional @xmath1 , a simple procedure does not exist .",
    "even so , with the aid of eq .",
    "( [ 4s ] ) , one might circumvent the problem by proposing that the expansion goes as a homogeneous polynomial whose nonzero terms all have the same degree @xmath43 . ",
    "homogeneous \" means that every term in the series is in some sense representative of the whole",
    ". then one does not really need to obtain a complete expansion of @xmath50 in order to predict dynamical laws for the transport , since it will be sufficient to consider a certain collection of terms which by themselves completely characterize the algebraic structure of @xmath50 as a consequence of the homogeneity property .",
    "we dub this collection of terms the backbone , and we define it through the homogeneous map @xmath54 in what follows , we consider the backbone as representing the algebraic structure of @xmath50 in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ 4s ] ) .",
    "so , for fractional @xmath1 , our analysis will be based on a reduced model which is obtained by replacing the original map @xmath50 by the backbone map @xmath55 .",
    "the claim is that the reduction @xmath56 does not really alter the scaling exponents behind the wave - spreading , since the algebraic structure of the original map is there anyway .",
    "note that @xmath50 and @xmath57 both have the same degree @xmath43 , which is the sum of the exponents of the variables that appear in their terms .",
    "note , also , that the original map coincides with its backbone in the limit @xmath58 .",
    "this property illustrates the significance of the quadratic nonlinearity _ vs. _ arbitrary power nonlinearity .",
    "turning to nlse  ( [ 1s ] ) , if we now substitute the original power nonlinearity with the backbone map , in the orthogonal basis of the anderson eigenstates we find @xmath59 where @xmath60 are complex coefficients characterizing the overlap structure of the nonlinear field , and we have reintroduced the eigenvalues of the linear problem , @xmath61 , satisfying @xmath62 .",
    "although obvious , it should be emphasized that the use of the backbone map @xmath57 in place of the original map @xmath50 preserves the hamiltonian character of the dynamics , but with a different interaction hamiltonian , @xmath63 , @xmath64 note that @xmath63 includes self - interactions through the diagonal elements @xmath65 .",
    "another important point worth noting is that the strength of the interaction vanishes in the limit @xmath66 ( as @xmath67 ) .",
    "therefore , keeping the @xmath4 parameter finite , and letting @xmath68 , one generates a regime where the nonlinear field is asymptotically localized .",
    "one sees that high - power nonlinearities act as to reinstall the anderson localization .",
    "we shall confirm this by the direct calculation of respective transport exponents .",
    "equations  ( [ 4s+ ] ) define a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators with a parametric dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "similarly to the nlse model with a quadratic power nonlinearity , each nonlinear oscillator with the hamiltonian @xmath69 and the equation of motion @xmath70 represents one nonlinear eigenstate in the system @xmath71 identified by its wave number @xmath72 , unperturbed frequency @xmath61 , and nonlinear frequency shift @xmath73 .",
    "we reiterate that non - diagonal elements @xmath74 characterize couplings between each four eigenstates with wave numbers @xmath72 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "the comprehension of hamiltonian character of the dynamics paves the way for a consistency analysis of the various transport scenarios behind the anderson localization problem ( with the topology of resonance overlap taken into account ) @xcite . to this end , the transport problem for the wave function becomes essentially a topological problem in phase space .",
    "the  edge \" character of onset transport corresponds to infinite chains of next - neighbor interactions with a minimized number of links at every step . for the reasons of symmetry , when summing on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 4s+ ] ) , the only combinations of terms to be taken into account , apart from the self - interaction term @xmath78 , are , essentially , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "these terms will come with respective interaction amplitudes @xmath65 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , which we shall denote simply by @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . then on the right - hand side ( r.h.s . ) of eq .",
    "( [ 4s+ ] ) we have @xmath86 the interaction hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ 6s+ ] ) becomes @xmath87 \\label{6s++ } % eq.~(\\ref{6s++})\\ ] ] representing the effective reduced @xmath63 for arbitrary real power @xmath27 .",
    "assuming that the exponent @xmath1 is confined between two integer numbers , i.e. , @xmath88 , in the next - neighbor interaction term we can write @xmath89 \\sigma_{k\\pm1}^{s - j } \\sigma^{*s - j}_{k } , \\label{6s++p } % eq.~(\\ref{6s++p})\\ ] ] where the prime symbol indicates that we have extracted the self - interactions .",
    "when drawn on a graph in wave - number space , the terms raised to the power @xmath90 will correspond to disconnected bonds , thought as cantor sets with the fractal dimensionality @xmath91 .",
    "hence , they will not contribute to field - spreading .",
    "these terms , therefore , can be cut off from the interaction hamiltonian , suggesting that only those terms raised to the integer power , @xmath92 , should be considered .",
    "we have , accordingly , @xmath93 this is the desired result .",
    "equation  ( [ 6s++c ] ) defines the effective reduced interaction hamiltonian in the parameter range of onset spreading for @xmath88 .",
    "focusing on the transport problem for the wave field , because the interactions are next - neighbor - like , it is convenient to project the system of coupled dynamical equations  ( [ 4s++ ] ) on a cayley tree , such that each node with the coordinate @xmath72 represents a nonlinear eigenstate , or nonlinear oscillator with the equation of motion  ( [ eq+s ] ) ; the outgoing bonds represent the complex amplitudes @xmath94 and @xmath95 ; and the ingoing bonds , which involve complex conjugation , represent the complex amplitudes @xmath96 . to make it with the amplitudes @xmath96 when raised to the algebraic power @xmath1 one needs for each node a fractional number @xmath1 of the ingoing bonds . confining the @xmath1 value between two nearest integer numbers , @xmath88 , we carry on with @xmath92 connected bonds , which we charge to receive the interactions , and one disconnected bond , which corresponds to a cantor set with the fractal dimensionality @xmath90 , and which can not transmit the waves . at this point we cut this bond off the tree .",
    "a similar procedure applied to the amplitudes @xmath94 , coming up in the algebraic power @xmath1 , generates @xmath92 outgoing bonds , leaving one disconnected bond behind .",
    "lastly , the remaining amplitude @xmath95 , which does not involve a nonlinear power , contributes with one outgoing bond for each combination of the indexes .",
    "one sees that the mapping requires a cayley tree with the coordination number @xmath97 .      .",

    "this exponent accounts for the deviation from the usual fickian diffusion in a self - similar geometry @xcite and observes remarkable invariance properties under homeomorphic maps of fractals @xcite .",
    "the scaling law in eq .",
    "( [ ms+ ] ) has been discussed by gefen et al .",
    "@xcite for anomalous diffusion on percolation clusters .",
    "the crucial assumption behind this scaling , however , is the assumption of self - similarity ( and _ not _ of percolation ) extending the range of validity of eq .",
    "( [ ms+ ] ) to any self - similar fractal . here",
    "we apply the scaling law in eq .",
    "( [ ms+ ] ) to cayley trees by appropriately choosing the @xmath101 value .",
    "we note in passing that self - similarity of the cayley trees is not necessarily manifest in their folding in the embedding space , but is inherent in their connectedness and topology @xcite . indeed",
    "a cayley tree is a graph without loops , where each node hosts the same number of branches ( known as the coordination number ) .",
    "therefore , one might expect from the outset that the value of @xmath101 will be a function of the coordination number , given that the dynamics occur on a cayley tree .",
    "the coordination number , in its turn , will depend on the power @xmath1 , thus paving the way to predict onset spreading in association with the topology of interaction between the components of the wave field .",
    "more so , the power nonlinearity in eq .",
    "( [ 1s ] ) suggests that the connectivity value is a _ multiplicative _ function of @xmath1 .",
    "also one might expect this function to naturally reproduce the known value @xmath102 @xcite for mean - field percolation on bethe lattices in the limit @xmath58 .",

    ", we look directly into the connectivity properties of finite clusters . for this , we need a simple procedure by which calculations can be done exactly .",
    "we formulate such a procedure for integer and half - integer values of @xmath1 using topological triangulation @xcite of the cayley tree . for the purpose of formal analysis , it is essential to choose a node on a cayley tree and a reference system of @xmath106 next - neighbor connecting bonds ( for a cayley tree with the coordination number @xmath107 ) .",
    "next we dispose the selected node of the cayley tree and immerse it into a @xmath106-dimensional euclidean space @xmath108 .",

    "for the standard cayley tree with @xmath110 the associated geometric construction is illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "more so , we apply the above procedure to _ all _ nodes of the original cayley tree , such that the nodes which communicate via a next - neighbor rule on the tree go to the ending points of the corresponding basis vectors in @xmath108 .",

    "<S> this study is concerned with destruction of anderson localization by a nonlinearity of the power - law type . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest using a nonlinear schrdinger model with random potential on a lattice that quadratic nonlinearity plays a dynamically very distinguished role in that it is the only type of power nonlinearity permitting an abrupt localization - delocalization transition with unlimited spreading already at the delocalization border . for super - quadratic nonlinearity </S>",
    "<S> the borderline spreading corresponds to diffusion processes on finite clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we have proposed an analytical method to predict and explain such transport processes . </S>",
    "<S> our method uses a topological approximation of the nonlinear anderson model and , if the exponent of the power nonlinearity is either integer or half - integer , will yield the wanted value of the transport exponent via a triangulation procedure in an euclidean mapping space . </S>",
    "<S> a kinetic picture of the transport arising from these investigations uses a fractional extension of the diffusion equation to fractional derivatives over the time , signifying non - markovian dynamics with algebraically decaying time correlations . </S>"
