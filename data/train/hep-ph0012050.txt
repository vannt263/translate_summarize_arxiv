    "denig in his very nice and introductory talk on the kloe status and first results ( see a.  g.  denig s talk in these proceedings ) , @xmath6 radiative decays into two pseudoscalar mesons and a photon are very interesting processes to be measured .",
    "their accurate measurements could offer us the possibility of shedding some light on the presently unclear nature of scalars ( in particular , in those channels involving the @xmath7 and @xmath2 resonances ) .",
    "these decays , and in general all the associated @xmath8 radiative decays with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , are not only a challenge for experimentalists but also for theorists .",
    "the reason for that is at least twofold .",
    "first , the center of mass energy of these processes is around 1 gev , an energy region that is , on the one side , too low for perturbative qcd to be applicable and , on the other , too high for chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) predictions to be reliable .",
    "accordingly , these processes provide us with an excellent laboratory for testing our knowledge of hadron physics in the 1 gev energy domain .",
    "second , due to the quantum numbers of the initial vector and of the final photon , both with @xmath11 , the remaining two pseudoscalar meson system is in a @xmath12 configuration states are very suppressed because the nearest tensorial resonances , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , are well above the lightest vector masses @xcite . ] , whose quantum numbers correspond precisely to those of a scalar state .",
    "so then , these vector radiative decays may help us to establish the nature of these scalar resonances , nowadays very controversial molecules @xcite or ordinary @xmath15 mesons @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite , and their poorly known properties ( masses and decay widths ) @xcite , thus adding further interest but also complexity to this 1 gev energy region .    in this presentation",
    ", we propose the linear sigma model ( l@xmath0 m ) as an appropriate framework for incorporating the lightest scalar resonances and their pole effects into a chpt inspired context .",
    "this will allow us to benefit from the common origin of chpt and the l@xmath0 m to improve the chiral loop predictions for the @xmath8 decays exploiting the complementarity of both approaches . as well known , chpt is the established theory of the pseudoscalar interactions at low energy .",
    "however , it is not reliable at energies of a typical vector meson mass and scalar resonance poles are not explicitly included . as a result",
    ", chpt inspired loop models can give rough estimates for @xmath16 but will hardly be able to reproduce the observed enhancements in the invariant mass spectra .",
    "the l@xmath0 m is a much simpler model dealing similarly with pseudoscalar interactions but taking into account scalar resonances in a systematic and definite way .",
    "consequently , the l@xmath0 m should be able to reproduce the resonance peaks in the spectra associated to the @xmath17 states and , although it does not provide a complete framework for the pseudoscalar meson physics , this model might be of relevance in describing the scalar resonance effects when linked to a well established chpt context .",
    "the novosibirsk cmd-2 and snd collaborations have reported very recently the branching ratio and the @xmath3 invariant mass distribution for the @xmath1 decay . for the branching ratio ,",
    "the cmd-2 collaboration reports @xmath18 @xcite , while the snd result is , consistently , @xmath19 @xcite . the observed invariant mass distribution shows a significant enhancement at large @xmath3 invariant mass that , according to refs .",
    "@xcite , could be interpreted as a manifestation of a sizeable contribution of the @xmath20 intermediate state .",
    "the last issue of the review of particle physics , including the previous cmd-2 value together with an older snd measurement @xcite announces @xmath21 @xcite , while the preliminary result presented in this conference by the kloe collaboration is @xmath22 ( see a.g .",
    "denig s contribution ) .",
    "this and other radiative @xmath6 decays are intensively investigated at the frascati @xmath6-factory da@xmath23ne @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the @xmath24 decays have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "specifically , it has been shown that the intermediate vector meson contributions to @xmath1 lead to a small @xmath25 @xcite , whereas a chiral loop model closely linked to standard chpt predicts @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "needless to say , the scalar resonance effects and , in particular , the resonance pole associated to the @xmath27(980 ) were not contemplated in these two schemes .",
    "the recent experimental data from novosibirsk and frascati for both the branching ratio and the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum seem therefore to disfavour these predictions based on vector meson exchange and/or a simple extrapolation of chpt ideas .",
    "if we rely on the resonance picture , it is clear that the @xmath2 scalar meson lying just below the @xmath6 mass and having the appropriate quantum numbers should play an important rle in the @xmath1 decay .",
    "several theoretical attempts to describe the effects of scalars in @xmath6 radiative decays have appeared so far : the  no structure \" model @xcite , the @xmath28 model @xcite , where the @xmath29 amplitude is generated through a loop of charged kaons , and the chiral unitary approach @xmath30 @xcite , where the decay @xmath1 occurs through a loop of charged kaons that subsequently annihilate into @xmath31 . in the two former cases the scalar resonances are included _",
    "ad hoc _ while in the latter they are generated dynamically by unitarizing the one - loop amplitudes .    as an example of our work",
    ", we discuss the @xmath1 decay mode .",
    "this process is the easiest to calculate since it only involves the @xmath2 scalar resonance whose properties are quite well known .",
    "this circumstance reduces to a minimum the uncertainties of the calculation and will render our theoretical prediction more definite and solid .",
    "this presentation is based on a more extensive analysis published in ref .",
    "the vector meson initiated @xmath8 decays can not be treated in strict chpt .",
    "this theory has to be extended to incorporate on - shell vector meson fields . at lowest order ,",
    "this may be easily achieved by means of the @xmath32 chpt lagrangian @xmath33 where @xmath34 mev at this order , @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the usual pseudoscalar nonet matrix , and @xmath37 in the isospin limit .",
    "the covariant derivative , now enlarged to include vector mesons , is defined as @xmath38 - i g [ v_\\mu , u]$ ] , with @xmath39 being the quark charge matrix and @xmath40 the additional matrix containing the nonet of ideally mixed vector meson fields .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath41 are @xmath42 and @xmath6 .",
    "there is no tree - level contribution from this lagrangian to the @xmath1 amplitude and at the one - loop level one needs to compute the set of diagrams shown in ref .",
    "a straightforward calculation leads to the following finite amplitude for @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the loop integral function and @xmath46 is the invariant mass of the final pseudoscalar system ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath47 is defined through the strong amplitude @xmath48 and is the part beyond standard chpt which is fixed from phenomenology .",
    "the four - pseudoscalar amplitude is instead a standard chpt amplitude if only the @xmath49 contribution is taken into account as in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] which is found to be @xmath50 in eqs .",
    "( [ aphichpt ] , [ a4pchptphys ] ) , a value of @xmath51 is taken for the @xmath52-@xmath53 mixing angle .",
    "this value , based on classical arguments of nonet symmetry , is in fairly agreement with recent phenomenological estimates @xcite .     as a function of the @xmath54 invariant mass in a chiral loop model .",
    "experimental data are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    the invariant mass distribution for the @xmath1 decay is then given by the spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ figchpt ] ) @xmath55 & \\times\\ |l(m^2_{\\pi^0\\eta})|^2    \\end{array}\\ ] ] integrating eq .",
    "( [ dgchpt ] ) over the whole physical region one obtains for the branching ratio @xmath56 as expected , fig .",
    "[ figchpt ] shows that our chiral loop approach gives a reasonable prediction for the lower part of the spectrum but fails to reproduce the observed enhancement in its higher part , where @xmath2-resonance effects should manifest . as a consequence",
    ", the branching ratio is below the experimental value by about a factor of 2 .",
    "to analyze the scalar resonance effects in the @xmath8 decay amplitudes , we use the linear sigma model ( l@xmath0 m ) @xcite as an adequate framework for describing such effects .",
    "it is a well - defined @xmath57 chiral model which incorporates _ ab initio _ both the nonet of pseudoscalar mesons together with its chiral partner , the scalar mesons nonet .",
    "recently , this model has shown to be rather phenomenologically successful in studying the implications of chiral symmetry for the controversial scalar sector of qcd @xcite .    in this context",
    ", the @xmath8 decays proceed through a loop of charged pseudoscalar mesons emitted by the initial vector that , due to the additional emission of a photon , can rescatter into pairs of neutral pseudoscalars with the quantum numbers of a scalar state .",
    "the scalar resonances are then expected to play an essential rle in this rescattering process and the l@xmath0 m will be shown particularly appropriate to fix the corresponding amplitudes .    for the case of @xmath1 ,",
    "the dominant contribution arises exclusively from a loop of charged kaons coupling . ]",
    "that subsequently rescatters into the final @xmath58 @xmath3 state . in the l@xmath0 m",
    ", the @xmath59 rescattering amplitude is driven by a contact term , a term with an @xmath27 exchanged in the @xmath60-channel , and two terms with a @xmath61 ( _ i.e .  _ the strange @xmath62 scalar resonance ) exchanged in the @xmath63- and @xmath64-channels .",
    "however , the latter @xmath61-exchange contributions are absent for an @xmath52-@xmath53 mixing angle @xmath51 since the @xmath65 coupling constant appearing in one of the @xmath61 vertices vanishes contributions . ] .",
    "a straightforward calculation of the @xmath1 decay amplitude leads to an expression identical to that in eq .",
    "( [ aphichpt ] ) but with the four - pseudoscalar amplitude now computed in a l@xmath0 m context . in this case , the amplitude is just @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the @xmath27 propagator .",
    "it is worth mentioning a few remarks on the four - pseudoscalar l@xmath0 m amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ a4plsigmamphys ] ) and its chpt counterpart in eq .",
    "( [ a4pchptphys ] ) : _ i ) _ for @xmath68 and ignoring @xmath69-breaking in the pseudoscalar masses and decay constants , the l@xmath0 m amplitude reduces to the chpt one .",
    "this means that the large scalar mass limit of the l@xmath0 m mimics perfectly ( in the @xmath69 limit ) the contributions from the derivative and massive terms of the chpt lagrangian ( [ chptlag ] ) .",
    "this , we believe , is the main virtue of our approach and makes the use of the l@xmath0 m reliable ; _ ii ) _ the reason for the l@xmath0 m and chpt yielding slightly different amplitudes in the @xmath68 limit is because of the way @xmath69-symmetry is broken in the two approaches .",
    "while in the l@xmath0 m a non @xmath69 symmetric choice of the vacuum expectation values makes simultaneously @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xcite , in chpt @xmath70 is already present at tree level whereas @xmath71 is only achieved at next - to - leading order ; _ iii ) _ the vicinity of the @xmath2 mass to the @xmath3 production threshold makes unavoidable the presence of the @xmath27 propagator to take into account the pole effects . its inclusion should guarantee the proper behavior of the higher part of the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum ; _ iv ) _ concerning the @xmath27 propagator , the opening of the @xmath72 channel close to the @xmath2 mass generates some uncertainties about which precise form for that propagator should be used . a first possibility consists in using a breit - wigner propagator with an energy dependent width to incorporate the known kinematic corrections : @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75        \\left[1-\\frac{(m_a - m_b)^2}{s}\\right]}\\ ,   \\theta ( \\sqrt{s}-(m_a+m_b))\\ , \\ ] ] for @xmath76 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the coupling constants @xmath77 ) .",
    "another interesting and widely accepted option was proposed by flatt time ago specifically to the two - channel @xmath27 resonance @xcite : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 i\\sqrt{\\frac{4m^2_k}{s}-1 } & \\ \\mbox{for $ \\sqrt{s } < 2m_k$ } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] for @xmath81 .",
    "the relative narrowness of the observed @xmath82 peak around 980 mev is then explained by the action of unitarity and analyticity at the @xmath72 threshold .    due to these distinct possibilities to deal with the @xmath27 propagator , as well as other differences introduced when implementing and fitting the basic l@xmath0 m lagrangian by several authors , a set of predictions can be obtained for the four - pseudoscalar amplitude ( [ a4plsigmamphys ] ) . in turn , these various amplitudes have to substitute the four - pseudoscalar chpt amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ dgchpt ] ) to finally obtain the corresponding invariant mass distributions of the @xmath1 decay mode .     as a function of the @xmath54 invariant mass in the l@xmath0 m .",

    "@xcite respectively .",

    "[ figlsigmam ] .",
    "integrating over the whole physical region leads to the branching ratio @xmath83 in agreement with the experimental branching ratio .",
    "however , since the simple expression used for the @xmath27 propagator implies a large @xmath27-width ( @xmath84 mev @xcite ) , the desired enhancement in the invariant mass spectrum appears in its central part rather than around the @xmath27 peak .",
    "this unpleasant feature is partially corrected when turning to the proposal by trnqvist @xcite , where a gaussian form factor related to the finite size of physical mesons and depending on the final cm - momentum is introduced to describe the decays of scalar resonances in this approach . as a result , the decay width of @xmath27(980 ) into @xmath3",
    "is reduced ( @xmath85 mev @xcite ) without affecting that of @xmath27(980 ) into @xmath72 .",
    "this fact produces an enhancement in the spectrum for the higher values of the @xmath54 invariant mass , as shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ figlsigmam ] .",

    "the @xmath27 width is then drastically reduced to a more acceptable visible width of @xmath87 mev . within this approach ,",
    "our prediction for the @xmath54 invariant mass is shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ figlsigmam ] and the integrated branching ratio is @xmath88 both the spectrum and the branching ratio are in nice agreement with the experimental data @xcite . the fact that shabalin s treatment incorporates the flatt corrections to the @xmath27 resonant shape has played a major rle in this achievement .",
    "in this presentation , i have discussed a new amplitude for the @xmath1 process that includes the effects of the @xmath2 scalar resonance .",
    "the l@xmath0 m has shown to be a very suitable framework for including the @xmath27 pole effects in a systematic and definite way .",

    ", it is safely concluded that the @xmath1 branching ratio is in the range @xmath4@xmath5 , a prediction that is compatible with the present experimental data .",
    "nevertheless , the uncertainties affecting these predictions suggest that more refined analyses are needed , particularly when the higher accuracy data from da@xmath23ne will be available .",
