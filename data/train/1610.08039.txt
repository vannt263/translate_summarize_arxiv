    "einstein s theory of gravity has now been tested extensively in the solar system and in binary pulsar systems , using a wide array of relativistic gravitational phenomena @xcite .",
    "these range from the deflection of light @xcite , to perihelion precession @xcite , geodetic precession @xcite , and frame dragging @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the standard framework that is used to interpret observations of these effects is the parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) formalism @xcite .",
    "this formalism is constructed so that it encompasses the possible consequences of a wide variety of metric theories of gravity , and so that it can act as a half - way house between the worlds of experimental and theoretical gravitational physics .",
    "the ppn formalism has been tremendously successful not just in constraining particular modified theories of gravity , but also in providing a common language that can be used to isolate and discuss the different physical degrees of freedom in the gravitational field .",
    "crucially , the form of the ppn metric is independent of the field equations of the underlying theory of gravity , and is simple enough to be effectively constrained with imperfect , real - world observations .",
    "it is also applicable in the regime of non - linear density contrasts .",
    "these are all highly desirable properties .    with the advent of a new generation of cosmological surveys @xcite ,",
    "it becomes pertinent to consider whether we can perform precision tests of einstein s theory on cosmological scales .",
    "of course , the standard ppn formalism itself can not be used directly for this purpose , as it is valid only for isolated astrophysical systems .",
    "more specifically , it relies on ( i ) asymptotical flatness and ( ii ) the slow variation of all quantities that might be linked to cosmic evolution .",
    "neither of these conditions should be expected to be valid when considering gravitational fields on large scales : there are no asymptotically flat regions in cosmology , and the time - scale of cosmic evolution is no longer necessarily entirely negligible",
    ". we must therefore adapt and extend the ppn approach , if it is to be used in cosmology .",
    "some of this work has already been performed within the context of einstein s theory @xcite , but more is required if we are going to attempt to port the entire formalism .",
    "this is what we intend to make a step towards in the present paper , in a formalism that we will call parameterized post - newtonian cosmology ( ppnc ) .    of course",
    ", we wish to retain as many of the beneficial properties of the ppn formalism as possible .",
    "in particular , we want to ensure that the formalism is still valid in the presence of non - linear structure after it has been transferred into cosmology .",
    "we also want to ensure that it can encompass as large a class of theories of gravity and dark energy models as possible , while remaining simple enough to be constrained by real observations .",
    "these requirements are important as many cosmological processes take place in the presence of non - linear structures , and because we want to be able to represent as many theories as possible .",
    "the parameterization that we end up with contains four functions of time that we expect to be able to link to the large - scale expansion , the growth of structure , and the lensing of light in a reasonably straightforward way .",
    "we do not assume any knowledge of the specific underlying theory of gravity in order to end up with this result , other than insisting that it fits into the class of conservative theories that can be described using the ppn formalism .",
    "our approach is built using a weak - field and slow - motion post - newtonian expansion , and so is naturally valid in the presence of non - linear structures ( up to neutron star densities ) .",
    "our work builds on a series of bottom - up approaches to cosmology , that has so far primarily been usually used to study the effect of small - scale inhomogeneities on the large - scale expansion within the context of general relativity @xcite-@xcite ( exceptions to this are applications to @xmath0 gravity @xcite and yukawa gravity @xcite ) .",
    "we also expect our study to complement the existing literature on parameterized frameworks for testing gravity in cosmology , which come under the umbrella terms of `` parameterized post - friedmannian '' approaches @xcite-@xcite and `` effective field theory '' approaches and their variants @xcite-@xcite .",
    "our approach differs from most of this existing literature in the fact that we emphasize the links between weak gravitational fields and cosmology , and use this to constrain the possibilities for the large - scale properties of cosmology .",
    "this means that we end up with a framework that is automatically consistent with the ppn formalism on small scales , and that is constrained by this consistency in the form that it can take on large scales . for reviews on modified theories of gravity and parameterized frameworks in cosmology , the reader is referred to refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the plan for the rest of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce the bottom - up constructions we will use to link weak - field gravity and cosmology @xcite .",
    "section [ sec3 ] contains a review of the standard parameterized post - newtonian approach , which we then modify for application to cosmology . in section [ cosmo ] ,",
    "we build a cosmology from the weak field metric without assuming any field equations .",
    "this results in a geometry with four unknown functions of time . finally , in section [ examples ]",
    ", we work through four explicit example theories , to show how we expect our formalism to function .",
    "our examples include dark energy models , and scalar - tensor and vector - tensor theories of gravity .",
    "we use lower - case latin letters ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , ... ) to denote space - time indices , and greek letters ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , ... ) to denote spatial indices .",
    "capitals from the first half of the latin alphabet ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , ... ) are used to denote the spatial components of tensors in @xmath10-dimensional subspaces , while those from the latter half ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , ... ) will be used to label quantities associated with various different matter fields .",
    "in this section we wish to explore the relationship between weak - field gravity and cosmology , without assuming anything about the field equations that govern the gravitational interaction ( i.e. without assuming a specific theory of gravity ) .",
    "these two sectors are usually treated entirely separately in the standard approach to cosmology , as they appear at different orders in cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "they are , however , intimately linked , and given some knowledge about the weak - field limit of gravity one can construct cosmological evolutions that are consistent with that limit .",
    "we do not require a set of field equations in order to do this , as long as we are considering metric theories of gravity .",
    "the end result is then a set of effective friedmann equations in which the large - scale expansion is driven by sources that can be expressed in terms of weak - field potentials .",
    "the link between these potentials and the energy - momentum content of the universe can subsequently be determined by the particular field equations of the theory that one wishes to consider .",
    "the great benefit of writing the friedmann equations in this way is that they can be directly expressed in terms of ( an extended version of ) the ppn parameters .",
    "this facilitates both a direct comparison of cosmological and weak - field tests of gravity , as well as constraining the otherwise near limitless freedoms that can exist when parameterizing gravitational interactions in cosmology .",
    "the perturbative approach we intend to use is the method of post - newtonian expansions .",
    "this approach is designed to be applied to the weak - field and slow - motion limit of gravitational interactions , and is formally an expansion around minkowski space in the parameter @xmath14 where @xmath3 is the speed of light , and @xmath15 is the three - velocity associated with matter fields .",
    "we can then use @xmath16 to assign orders of magnitude to the matter content and the metric perturbations , such that @xmath17 where @xmath6 is the mass density , and @xmath18 represents a generic gravitational potential .",
    "the post - newtonian expansion is valid in the quasi - static regime , where time derivatives are small compared to space derivatives , such that @xmath19 this means that the length scales associated with these gravitational fields must be small compared to the horizon size .",
    "we will therefore use the post - newtonian expansion to describe small regions of space , and patch these regions together to determine the emergent large - scale cosmological expansion . for further details of post - newtonian perturbative expansions the reader",
    "is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the ppn formalism , and post - newtonian expansion generally , are formulated as an expansion about minkowski space , such that the geometry can be described to lowest non - trivial order by @xmath20 where the gravitational potentials are of order @xmath21 . in the present context , it is useful to transform this line - element so that it can be written as a perturbed friedmann geometry .",

    "this is , however , only a coordinate transformation of the perturbed minkowski space from equation ( [ weakfield ] ) .",
    "it is therefore only valid within the same region of space that the perturbed minkowski description was valid ( i.e. a space much smaller than the size of the horizon ) .",
    "the scale factor , @xmath31 , is not yet the solution to any set of friedmann equations , and does not yet correspond to the scale factor of any global friedmann space .",
    "it is simply an arbitrary function of time , introduced by the coordinate transformations in equations ( [ timetrans ] ) - ( [ ztrans ] ) . in order to associate it with a global scale factor , and determine the relevant friedmann equations , we must patch together many such regions of space , using appropriate junction conditions .",
    "the conditions required at the junction between neighbouring regions of space , in order for their union to be considered a solution of the field equations , will now be determined .",
    "let us first choose to consider junctions that are @xmath32-dimensional time - like submanifolds of the global space - time . in this case , the space - like unit vector normal to the junction is given as the solution to @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the coordinates on the boundary .",
    "the first and second fundamental forms on the boundary are then given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the projection tensor onto the boundary .",

    "we expect these conditions to apply to any theory of gravity that contains second derivatives of the metric in its field equations , as they simply correspond to the metric being @xmath43 smooth at the boundary .",
    "the junction conditions ( [ metjunc1 ] ) and ( [ metjunc2 ] ) are sufficient to allow us to evaluate the motion of the boundaries of each of our small regions of space , and therefore also tell us the cosmological expansion we expect to obtain from regions described by the geometry in ( [ weakfield ] ) and ( [ flrw ] ) .",

    "we emphasize that nowhere in this section have we assumed anything about any theory of gravity or a set of field equations , other than the junction conditions ( [ metjunc1 ] ) and ( [ metjunc2 ] ) .",

    "we will then discuss how we can extend it to include other forms of matter that are relevant in cosmology , and to include the time dependence that is a crucial feature of an expanding universe .",
    "this will require not only allowing the parameters themselves to be dynamical , but also the boundary conditions that we use for solving the relevant hierarchy of poisson equations .",

    "we will see in the following section that simple dark energy models and conservative theories of modified gravity do , in fact , obey these expectations .",
    "in this section will investigate how specific example theories of gravity can be incorporated into the formalism described above .",
    "for each theory we will calculate the value of the set of parameters @xmath145 , using the weak - field and slow - motion limit of the theory .",
    "we will then use the method outlined in section [ sec2 ] to determine the emergent cosmological expansion for each theory , by using the appropriate set of junction conditions .",
    "this will give a set of friedmann - like equations that govern the emergent cosmological expansion , and which can be compared to the analogous equations that one finds when considering the actual flrw solutions for each of the theories under consideration .",

    "firstly , it shows that the method used in section [ cosmo ] does faithfully represent the perturbed friedmann solutions of a wide class of modified theories of gravity .",
    "secondly , it confirms that the effect of non - linear structure on the large - scale properties of the cosmology can be neglected at leading order in perturbation theory .",
    "this latter property is required if we are to make any sensible link between weak - field gravity and flrw cosmology .",
    "our first worked example will be general dark energy models in einstein s theory .",
    "as sub - cases of this we look at simple quintessence dark energy models with a minimally coupled scalar field , as well as the standard @xmath146cdm model .",
    "we then consider scalar - tensor and vector - tensor theories of gravity as further worked examples .",
    "these two classes of theories require additional junction conditions for the additional degrees of freedom that they contain .",
    "this is the case because theories in which the field equations contain at most second - order derivatives of the fundamental fields should generically be expected to obey junction conditions that imply the smoothness and continuity of each of these fields . for einstein s",
    "theory , this just corresponds to equations ( [ metjunc1 ] ) and ( [ metjunc2 ] ) , as the metric is the only dynamical degree of freedom in the theory . for modified theories of gravity ,",
    "the extra degrees of freedom must satisfy a similar set of conditions .",
    "let us first consider a general dark energy model where a dark fluid is minimally coupled to the metric .",
    "the gravitational theory in this case is still given by einstein s field equations , @xmath147 where @xmath148 , and @xmath149 and @xmath150 are the energy - momentum tensors of non - relativistic matter and the dark fluid , respectively . using the metric from equation ,",
    "the poisson equations we obtain for the gravitational potentials in the weak - field limit are then given by @xmath151 this immediately gives the ppn parameters as @xmath152 which are , of course , the usual values of these parameters in einstein s theory .",

    "these equations must be obeyed by both @xmath134 and @xmath127 . for the field equations given in ( [ de1 ] ) and ( [ de2 ] )",

    "the consistency between these equations and the flrw equations of the same theory shows that our ppnc construction works for general relativity with general barotropic fluids .",
    "if we specialize further , to the case of a quintessence field @xcite , the we have that the energy density and pressure are given by @xmath158 and @xmath159 , where @xmath160 .",
    "this gives @xmath161 where @xmath71 is the minimally - coupled scalar field and @xmath162 is the potential of that field .",

    "the only extra equation we get in this case is the propagation equation for the scalar field : @xmath164 which can be derived from the continuity equation .",
    "this shows our parameterization is consistent with quintessence models of dark energy .",
    "it must therefore also be consistent with the @xmath146cdm model , as this just correponds to the case where both @xmath71 and @xmath162 are constant .",
    "in this case we can set @xmath165 , and our parameters reduce to @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "the acceleration and constraint equations then reduce to the friedmann equations of @xmath146cdm universe .",
    "our parameterization therefore also works for the standard @xmath146cdm model .",
    "let us now turn our attention to a general class of scalar - tensor theories of gravity .",
    "these theories are some of the simplest generic modifications that one can make to general relativity , and involve the addition of only one non - minimally coupled scalar field , @xmath71 . in order to fit into the formalism above",

    "they are also identical to the parameterized expressions presented in equations ( [ fincon ] ) and ( [ accgen2 ] ) , with the appropriate values of @xmath270 .",
    "once more , the first - order quasi - static cosmological perturbations are given by equations ( [ np1 ] ) and ( [ np2 ] ) , this time with @xmath67 and @xmath64 given by equations ( [ alphavectortensor ] ) and ( [ gammavectortensor ] ) .",
    "this shows that the parameterization we presented in section [ cosmo ] is again applicable , even though the equations are much more complicated in this case .",
    "this again highlights the highly compact nature of the parameterized expressions presented in section [ cosmo ] , and its ability to incorporate theories that fit into the ppn formalism .",
    "in this paper we have constructed a parameterization that extends and transforms the ppn formalism for use in cosmology .",
    "this framework is not simply built in analogy to the ppn formalism , but is actually isometric to it on suitably defined spatial domains ( that is , the two systems are actually equivalent in a physically meaningful sense ) .",
    "the result is a set of parameterized cosmologies that are fully consistent with the standard framework that is used to constrain gravity in the weak - field slow - motion limit of gravity , and that can be used to test einstein s gravity and its many alternatives on cosmological scales .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the consistency requirement with ppn requires that the parameters involved must be functions of time only .",
    "it also gives constraints on the present day values of some of these parameters , if local experiments are to measure the correct value of newton s constant , @xmath66 , and an experimentally acceptable value of the spatial curvature caused by rest mass , @xmath64 .",
    "if one did allow for spatial dependence in our parameters then the result would not be compatible with ppn , and should generically be expected to lead to either strong back - reaction or gravity without the presence of rest mass ( depending on the parameter in question ) .",
    "formally , we end up with a generic system of friedmann equations , and linear - order scalar perturbations in the quasi - static limit , that are valid for any theories of gravity that fit into the ppn approach .",
    "our full set of parameters is given by the functions @xmath271 .",
    "the first two of these reduce to the corresponding ppn parameters when @xmath272 , and the second two are new `` cosmological '' parameters that determine the rate of expansion and acceleration in the large - scale cosmology .",
    "the correspondence with ppn parameters means that cosmological observations can be used to either ( i ) impose constraints on @xmath67 and @xmath64 over cosmologically interesting scales that complement those obtained from isolated astrophysical systems , or ( ii ) impose the following boundary conditions on the initial values of @xmath67 and @xmath64 : @xmath273 the former of these ensures that local gravitational experiments measure the correct value of @xmath66 , and the latter is the experimentally determined value of @xmath64 from observations of the shapiro time - delay effect of radio signals from the cassini spacecraft as they pass by the sun @xcite . in case ( ii ) , observations at high redshifts could be used to impose constraints on the variation of @xmath66 as the universe evolves , by constraining @xmath194 at times @xmath274 .",
    "observationally , one can constrain the parameters @xmath271 with the cosmological probes that are , by now , quite standard in constraining modified theories of gravity .",
    "importantly , however , we allow for the background expansion to be a part of the parameterization .",
    "this is required for most minimal modifications to einstein s theory , including the scalar - tensor and vector - tensor theories considered in this paper , and offers new ways to constrain the underlying theory .",
    "we also have equation , which provides a consistency relation between our parameters , and may reduce the number of observables required to constrain our full set of parameters . in terms of specific observables ,",
    "one could for example use supernova data to constrain the hubble rate @xmath275 and the acceleration @xmath276 @xcite .",
    "independent information on the density of baryons and dark matter ( e.g. from primordial nucleosynthesis ) together with information on the spatial curvature of the universe ( e.g. from cmb @xcite and bao observations @xcite ) , should then provide constraints on @xmath277 and @xmath278 .",
    "cosmological perturbations , on the other hand , can be used together with observations of the growth rate of structure to determine @xmath194 , and together with observations of weak - lensing to determine the combination @xmath279 .",
    "this is just a schematic of what is possible of course , and a large number of other cosmological probes are also available to provide additional constraints . in general , we expect there to be more observational probes than parameters in this framework , meaning that the system should be able to be constrained effectively with existing and upcoming data .",
    "of course , there are also certain limitations to our formalism .",
    "it does not , for example , apply to many of the more complicated theories of gravity that are now frequently considered in cosmology , as such theories do not always fit into the ppn framework .",
    "these theories may include yukawa potentials or involve non - perturbative gravity in the weak - field regime , both of which we have neglected to consider here .",
    "these subjects will be addressed in future studies , although it has recently been shown that one should generically expect yukawa potentials to lead to strong back - reaction @xcite , and we strongly suspect the same applies to theories that involve non - perturbative screening mechanisms .",
    "including these more complicated theories should therefore be expected to lead to significant complication in the parameterized framework . in this sense",
    ", one can consider the ppnc framework we have outlined here as a minimal construction for testing minimal deviations from einstein s theory .",
    "this is sufficient to use tests of gravity from cosmology to constrain conservative theories , as is usual in both solar system and binary pulsar applications of the ppn formalism .",
