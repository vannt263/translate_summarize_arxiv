    "we are now sure , that qcd is the genuine theory of strong interactions . in the perturbative region at high momenta the theory excellently describes the totality of data .",

    "we have @xmath9 from here we obtain @xmath10 thus from  ( [ eq : alphas3 ] ) we see , that for @xmath11 we have the pole ( and the cut at the same point ) .    at first such pole",
    "was disclosed in qed  @xcite and thus was called the landau pole .",
    "the existence of the pole makes a theory internally contradictory . as for qed , l.d .",
    "landau himself in the issue dedicated to niels bohr  @xcite had first stated , that for a realistic number of the charged elementary fields the pole was situated far beyond the planck mass and so it presumably could be removed by quantum gravitation effects .",
    "however in qcd pole is situated in the observable region of few hundreds mev . as far as we know , there is no way to get rid of such pole in the framework of the perturbation theory .",
    "it is a general belief , that non - perturbative contributions somehow exclude the pole . for reviews of different possibilities",
    "see _ e.g. _  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we would demonstrate just how the pole in  ( [ eq : alphas3 ] ) could be eliminated in the approach to non - perturbative effects in gauge theories , which was induced by the famous n.n .",
    "bogoliubov compensation approach  @xcite .",
    "for the beginning we consider pure gluon qcd without quarks . we start with lagrangian with gauge group @xmath12 .",
    "that is we define the gauge sector to be color octet of gluons @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 where we use the standard notations .",
    "let us consider a possibility of spontaneous generation of the following effective interaction @xmath15 which is usually called the anomalous three - gluon interaction .    here",
    "notation @xmath16 means corresponding non - local vertex in the momentum space @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a form - factor and @xmath19 are respectively incoming momenta , lorentz indices and color indices of gluons .    in accordance to the bogoliubov approach  @xcite in application",
    "to qft  @xcite we look for a non - trivial solution of a compensation equation , which is formulated on the basis of the bogoliubov procedure * add  subtract*. namely let us write down the initial expression  ( [ eq : initial ] ) in the following form @xmath20 here notation @xmath21 is already explained  ( [ eq : vertex ] ) .",
    "we mean also that there are present four - gluon , five - gluon and six - gluon vertices according to expression for @xmath22 ( [ eq : initial ] ) .",
    "note , that inclusion of total gluon term @xmath23 in the new free lagrangian  ( [ eq : l0 ] ) is performed in view of maintaining the gauge invariance of the approach .",
    "effective interaction  ( [ eq : effint ] ) is called * anomalous three - gluon interaction*. our interaction constant @xmath24 is to be defined by the subsequent studies .",
    "let us consider expression   ( [ eq : l0 ] ) as the new * free * lagrangian @xmath25 , whereas expression  ( [ eq : lint ] ) as the new * interaction * lagrangian @xmath26 .",
    "it is important to note , that we put into the new * free * lagrangian the full quadratic in @xmath27 term including gluon self - interaction , because we prefer to maintain gauge invariance of the approximation being used .",
    "indeed , we shall use both four - gluon term from the last term in  ( [ eq : l0 ] ) and triple one from the last but one term of  ( [ eq : l0 ] ) . then",
    "compensation conditions ( see for details  @xcite ) will consist in demand of full connected three - boson vertices of the structure  ( [ eq : vertex ] ) , following from lagrangian @xmath25 , to be zero .",
    "this demand gives a non - linear equation for form - factor @xmath27 .",
    "such equations according to terminology of works  @xcite are called * compensation equations*. in a study of these equations it is always evident the existence of a perturbative trivial solution ( in our case @xmath28 ) , but , in general , a non - perturbative non - trivial solution may also exist .",
    "just the quest of a non - trivial solution inspires the main interest in such problems .",
    "one can not succeed in finding an exact non - trivial solution in a realistic theory , therefore it is of great importance to choose an adequate approach , the first non - perturbative approximation of which describes the main features of the problem .",
    "improvement of a precision of results is to be achieved by corrections to the initial first approximation .",
    "thus our task is to formulate the first approximation . here",
    "the experience acquired in the course of performing works  @xcite could be helpful .",
    "now in view of obtaining the first approximation we would make the following assumptions .",
    "+ 1 ) in compensation equation we restrict ourselves by terms with loop numbers 0 , 1 .",
    "+ 2 ) we reduce thus obtained non - linear compensation equation to a linear integral equation .",
    "it means that in loop terms only one vertex contains the form - factor , being defined above , while other vertices are considered to be point - like . in diagram form equation for form - factor @xmath27",
    "is presented in fig.1 . here",
    "four - leg vertex correspond to interaction of four bosons due to our effective three - gluon interaction . in our approximation",
    "we take here the vertex with interaction constant proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "+ 3 ) we integrate by angular variables of the 4-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the necessary rules are presented in paper  @xcite .",
    "let us note that such approximation was previously used in works  @xcite in the study of spontaneous generation of effective nambu  jona - lasinio interaction .",
    "it was shown in the works that the results agree with data with average accuracy @xmath30 .",
    "thus we could hope for such accuracy in the present problem .",
    "let us formulate compensation equations in this approximation .    for * free * lagrangian @xmath25 full connected three - boson vertices with lorentz structure  ( [ eq : vertex ] ) are to vanish .",
    "one can succeed in obtaining analytic solutions for the following set of momentum variables ( see fig.1 ) : left - hand legs have momenta @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and a right - hand leg has zero momenta .",
    "however in our approximation we need form - factor @xmath27 also for non - zero values of this momentum .",
    "we look for a solution with the following simple dependence on all three variables @xmath33 really , expression  ( [ eq:123 ] ) is symmetric and it turns to @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "we consider the representation  ( [ eq:123 ] ) to be the first approximation and we it would be advisable to take into account the corresponding correction in forthcoming studies",
    ". we shall also discuss below some possible corrections due to this problem .",
    "at first let us present the expression for four - boson vertex @xmath36 here triad @xmath37 _ etc _ means correspondingly incoming momentum , color index , lorentz index of a gluon and @xmath27 is the same form - factor as in expression  ( [ eq : vertex ] ) .    ) , open circles to the same vertex with unity form - factor , open circles with four legs correspond to vertex  ( [ eq : four ] ) , simple point corresponds to usual perturbative vertex.,width=680 ]    now according to the rules being stated above we obtain the following equation for form - factor @xmath34 , which corresponds to fig.1 .",
    "@xmath38    here @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is an integration momentum , number of colors @xmath42 .",
    "here we also divide the initial equation by coupling constant @xmath24 in view of looking for non - trivial solutions .",
    "of course , the trivial solution @xmath43 is always possible .",
    "the last four terms in brackets represent diagrams with one usual gauge vertex ( see three last diagrams at fig.1 ) these terms maintain the gauge invariance of results in this approximation .",
    "note that one can additionally check the gauge invariance by introduction of longitudinal term @xmath44 in boson propagators to verify independence of results on @xmath45 in this approximation .",
    "ghost contributions also give zero result in the present approximation due to vertex  ( [ eq : vertex ] ) being transverse : @xmath46 gauge invariance might be also violated by terms arising from momentum dependence of form - factor @xmath27 .",
    "however this problem does not arise in the approximation corresponding to equation  ( [ eq : f ] ) and becomes essential for taking into account of @xmath47 terms . in this case ghost contributions",
    "also do not cancel .",
    "the problem of gauge invariance of the next approximations has to be considered in future studies .",
    "we introduce in equation  ( [ eq : f ] ) an effective cut - off @xmath48 , which bounds a `` low - momentum '' region where our non - perturbative effects act and consider the equation at interval @xmath49 $ ] under condition @xmath50 and for @xmath51 we continuously transit to the trivial solution @xmath43 .",

    "the last condition  ( [ eq : pht1 ] ) means smooth transition from the non - trivial solution to trivial one @xmath43 . knowing form  ( [ eq : solutiong ] ) of a solution we calculate both sides of relation  ( [ eq : fg ] ) in two different points in interval @xmath71 and having four equations for four parameters",

    "with @xmath72 we obtain the following solution , which we use to describe qcd case @xmath73 we would draw attention to the fixed value of parameter @xmath74 .",
    "the solution exists only for this value  ( [ eq : gy ] ) and it plays the role of eigenvalue . as a matter of fact from the beginning",
    "the existence of such eigenvalue is by no means evident .",
    "this parameter @xmath74 defines scale appropriate to the solution .",
    "that is why we take value of running coupling @xmath52 in solution  ( [ eq : gy ] ) just at this point .",
    "note , that in what follows we always use the notation @xmath34 for the main form - factor of the approach .",
    "it is worth to note , that there is also another solution of the set of equations , which corresponds to larger value of @xmath75 and smaller value of @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "we apply this solution for an adequate description of non - perturbative contributions to the electro - weak interaction  @xcite .",
    "let us recall that from three - loop expression for @xmath78  ( [ eq : alphas3 ] ) with number of flavors @xmath79 we have normalization of its value at mass of @xmath8-lepton  ( [ eq : alphatau ] ) .",
    "we normalize the running coupling by condition @xmath80 where coupling constant @xmath52 entering in expression  ( [ eq : gy ] ) is just corresponding to this normalization point . now from definition of @xmath81  ( [ eq : solution ] ) and value @xmath74  ( [ eq : gy ] ) we have @xmath82 thus we have obtained the definite value for the coupling of the interaction  ( [ eq : effint ] ) under discussion .",
    "typical energy scale around @xmath83 is natural for strong interaction .",
    "it is also worth mentioning the value of the momentum which corresponds to boundary of non - perturbative region @xmath74 . from eqs.([eq : gy ] , [ eq : gg ] ) we have for this momentum @xmath84 non - perturbative boundary  ( [ eq : p0 ] ) seems also natural from phenomenological point of view .",
    "we have to bear in mind , of course , that all these results are obtained under chosen approximation .",
    "for example , change of form of dependence on three variables in expression  ( [ eq:123 ] ) leads to some change in constant term in inhomogeneous part of equation  ( [ eq : fg ] ) .",
    "the coefficient afore the logarithm in its second term does not depend on the form , but the constant one can be changed .",
    "it is important to understand how small changes in this term influence results . in view of this",
    "we consider additional term @xmath85 in the inhomogeneous part of  ( [ eq : fg ] ) .",
    "thus we have the following modified expression @xmath86    let us take example @xmath87 .",

    "we have @xmath92",
    "in previous sections n.n . bogoliubov compensation principle  @xcite was applied to studies of a spontaneous generation of effective non - local interaction  ( [ eq : effint ] ) in qcd .",
    "it is of the utmost interest to study an influence of interaction  ( [ eq : effint ] ) on the behavior of strong running coupling @xmath93 in the region below @xmath74 _ i.e. _ @xmath94([eq : p0 ] ) .",
