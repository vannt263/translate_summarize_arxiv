    "msps are a population of old neutron stars with short spin period @xmath1  ms and small characteristic magnetic field @xmath2  g ( actually small period derivative @xmath3 ) .",
    "they are believed to be formed from the recycling ( accretion spin - up ) process in binaries @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is another possible formation channel for msps ( even for sub - millisecond pulsars ) , that is accretion - induced collapse of white dwarfs in a binary @xcite . because of the high stability of their rotations ,",
    "msps have great potential for application : autonomous deep - space navigation , pulsar - based time scale , low - frequency gravitational wave detection and so on .",
    "when the first msp , psr b1937 + 21 , had been discovered in 1982 @xcite , @xcite soon predicted that this pulsar could emit @xmath0-rays via synchrotron radiation on the order of 100 gev .",
    "@xcite subsequently calculated the @xmath0-ray luminosity of msps , estimated their contribution to the diffuse @xmath0-ray background of the milky way , and finally discussed detectability of msps as point @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "using the data of _ energetic gamma ray experiment _ , @xcite showed circumstantial evidence for the likely detection of pulsed @xmath0-ray emission from a msp , psr j0218 + 4232 , which was regarded as a @xmath0-ray pulsar candidate for a long time .",
    "msps @xmath0-ray emission was not observationally confirmed until _ fermi _ with a sensitive large area telescope ( lat ) launched in june of 2008 . using eight - month data of _ fermi _ lat , eight @xmath0-ray msps",
    "have already been detected @xcite .",
    "this number has grown to more than 40 up to date @xcite , and still increases .    from observations ,",
    "msps are analogous to young pulsars , which have multi - wavelength pulsed emission from radio to @xmath0-ray band .",
    "do msps and young pulsars share a simple model that contains similar emission region and acceleration mechanism to self - consistently explain their multi - wavelength emission ?",
    "more and more multi - wavelength data with high precision give us opportunities to obtain remarkable insights of the magnetospheric physics .",
    "the multi - wavelength study is a key method to discriminate the various pulsar non - thermal emission models for both msps and young pulsars .    initially aiming to explain the high - energy pulsed emission from young pulsars , four traditional magnetospheric gap models",
    "have been suggested to study pulsed high energy emission of pulsars : the polar cap model @xcite , the outer gap model @xcite , tpc / slot gap model @xcite , and the annular gap model @xcite . to distinguish these pulsar models , the most important issues are the inducements of acceleration electric field region and related emission mechanisms to emanate high - energy photons @xcite .",
    "one of the key discrepancies of the mentioned emission models is one - pole or two - pole emission pattern which depends on two corresponding geometry parameters : magnetic inclination angle @xmath4 and viewing angle @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite adopted the polar - cap model to calculate the @xmath0-ray emission from msps .",
    "they pointed out that curvature radiation of primary particles contributed to the mev - to - gev band , while the synchrotron radiation arising from pairs dominated only below 1 mev .",
    "@xcite developed the pair - starved polar cap model and obtain similar spectral conclusion for high - energy emission from msps as above . in this model",
    "the accelerating field is not screened and the entire open volume is available for particle acceleration and emission of gamma rays .",
    "@xcite used the outer gap model with multi - pole magnetic field to model the x - ray and @xmath0-ray spectra for four msps , and the predicted results basically agree with the observations @xcite .    along with radio observations supplying us with excellent timing solutions for _ fermi _ msps , the derived @xmath0-ray and radio light curves with high signal - to - noise allow us to do joint simulation which can justify the pulsar emission models . recently , @xcite simulated both radio and @xmath0-ray light curves for msps in the pair - starved polar cap , tpc and outer gap models , and they found that most of their simulated light curves are well explained by the tpc and outer gap models .",
    "they especially simulated light curves for a minor group of msps with phase - aligned radio and @xmath0-ray pulse profiles @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite also used the geometric slot gap , outer gap model or pair - starved polar cap model to fit @xmath0-ray and radio light curves for three msps .",
    "a msp psr j0101 - 6422 with complex radio and @xmath0-ray light curves , challenge the popular tpc and outer gap models @xcite .",
    "it is found that neither of the two models can faithfully reproduce the observed light curves and phase lags .",
    "for such a complex radio profile the simple beam model they used may have been insufficient .    in this paper",
    ", we use a 3d annular gap model to study both radio and @xmath0-ray light curves for three msps which stand for the relevant types of msps with different radio lags . in  2 ,",
    "the annular gap and core gap will be simply introduced and the acceleration electric field in the annular gap is calculated . in  3 , we jointly simulate radio and @xmath0-ray band light curves for psr j0034 - 0534 , j0101 - 6422 and j0437 - 4715 .",
    "the radio phase lags are identified and the reasons for them explored .",
    "the conclusions and discussions are shown in  4 .",
    "in a pulsar magnetosphere @xcite , the critical field lines at the light cylinder . ]",
    "divide a polar cap into two distinct parts : the annular gap region and the core gap region ( see figure 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the annular gap is constrained between the critical and last open field lines , and the core gap is around the magnetic axis and within critical field lines @xcite .",
    "the size of the polar cap decreases with increasing spin period , but can be quite large for msps and young pulsars .",
    "the annular gap width is correspondingly larger for short spin - period pulsars , and it varies with the magnetic azimuth @xmath6 . for an anti - parallel rotator and @xmath7 ,",
    "the radii of the annular polar region is @xmath8 @xcite , here @xmath9 is a pulsar s radius , and @xmath10 is its angular spin frequency .    combining advantages of the outer gap and tpc models",
    ", @xcite originally suggested the annular gap model , which has been further developed by @xcite .",
    "the site for generation of high energy photons is mainly located in the vicinity of the null charge surface @xcite is zero . ] .",
    "being consistent with the physically calculated spectra @xcite , the gaussian emissivities are numerically assumed when simulating light curves .",
    "the key emission geometry parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 are not convincingly confirmed so far , we adopt these two values from related literature if they exist . if there are not any reliable values , we just use some random values according to theories of msps magnetic field evolution . by hypothesizing reasonable emissivities and the magnetic inclination angle",
    ", this model can make wide fan - like emission beams , thus well reproduce the relevant light curves cut by a suitable viewing angle .",
    "co - rotating charge - separated plasma is filled in a pulsar magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "when reaching some regions near the light cylinder , charged particles can not exceed the speed of light ( @xmath11 ) , thus escape from the magnetosphere . to compensate the escaping particles ,",
    "the pulsar has to supply sufficient charged particles to its magnetosphere .",
    "this dynamic process continuously happens , thus a huge acceleration electric field is generated in the magnetosphere .",
    "this is the general mechanism for acceleration electric field ( @xmath12 ) , which is suitable for both young pulsars @xcite and msps . the charged particles with opposite signs are simultaneously exporting from the annular gap and core gap , and satisfies the condition of circuit closure in the whole magnetosphere .",
    "we assume the flowing - out particles charge density equals to the local goldreich - julian density @xcite at a radial distance of @xmath13 , here @xmath14 is a radius of light cylinder .",
    "the detailed calculation method and formulae are presented in @xcite .",
    "the acceleration electric fields of typical msps are shown in figure  [ elec ] using four sets of surface magnetic field @xmath15 and spin period @xmath16 .",
    "for msps with large or small values of @xmath16 and @xmath15 , we found that , in all cases , the electric field in the inner region of the annular gap is sufficiently high ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the charged particles accelerated in the annular gap or core gap are flowing out along a field line in a quasi - steady state . using the derived acceleration electric field ,",
    "we can obtain the lorentz factor @xmath18 of primary particles from the balance of acceleration and curvature radiation reaction @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the charge of an electron , @xmath21 the curvature radius in units of @xmath22 cm and @xmath23 the acceleration electric field in units of @xmath24 .",
    "the primary particles are accelerated to ultra - relativistic energy with typical lorentz factors of @xmath25 , because of the huge acceleration electric field in the annular gap . since a lot of @xmath0-ray photons",
    "are generated by the primary particles via curvature radiation and inverse compton scattering processes , abundant @xmath26 pairs are subsequently created through two - photon annihilation and photon - magnetic - absorption ( @xmath0-b ) processes .",
    "thanks to the _",
    "fermi_-lat , we now know that some msps are muti - wavelength emitters which have detectable radio and @xmath0-ray pulsed emission . according to the observations of phase lag ( @xmath27 ) between radio peak and @xmath0-ray peak @xcite , msps can be divided into four classes .",
    "psr j0034 - 0534 represents a class of msps which has phase - aligned light curves ( @xmath28 ) ; psr j0101 - 6422 stands for another class which has moderate radio phase lag @xmath29 with quite complex radio or @xmath0-ray light curves ; psr j0437 - 4715 stands for a third class which has larger radio lag @xmath30 and psr j1744 - 1134 is a fourth class of msps whose @xmath0-ray peak precedes the radio peak @xcite , we will model this msp in future when high signal - to - noise @xmath0-ray light curves are available .",
    "we process _",
    "pass 7 data to derive the observed light curves for three msps according to the radio timing solutions of msps from fermi science support center ( fssc ) .",
    "we select events with energies of @xmath31gev within 2@xmath32 of each msp s position and with zenith angles smaller than 105@xmath32 .",
    "the key filter conditions for good time interval are rock angle @xmath33 and angsep(ra@xmath34 , dec@xmath34 , ra@xmath35 , dec@xmath36)@xmath37 , where ra and dec are right ascension and declination respectively .",
    "then we use tempo2 @xcite with _ fermi _ plug - in to obtain the spin phase for each photon .",
    "finally we obtain the high signal - to - noise @xmath0-ray light curves for the three msps ( see red lines in figure 2 , 3 , 4 ) .    a convincing model should have simple clear emission geometric picture with reasonable input parameters , which can not only reproduce multi - wavelength light curves for young pulsars but also for msps . in this paper , we will jointly simulate radio and @xmath0-ray light curves for psr j0034 - 0534 , psr j0101 - 6422 and psr j0437 - 4715 .",
    "we briefly introduce the simulation method here .",
    "as shown in table 1 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are `` first - rank '' parameters , which are primarily adopted from the literature if they exist .",
    "when there are not any convincing values , we tend to use reasonable values of @xmath4 from relevant theory on magnetic field evolution of pulsars @xcite and @xmath5 is adopted randomly according to the simulated emission pattern ( photon sky - map ) .",
    "when @xmath4 and @xmath5 are fixed , several other model parameters are carefully adjusted for the emission regions until the observed light curve of the corresponding band can be reproduced .",
    "the model parameters for three msps are listed in table 1 .",

    "the simulation method is the same as described in  3.1 of @xcite .",
    "the key idea is to project all radiation intensities in both the annular gap and core gap to the `` non - rotating '' sky , considering some physical effects ( e.g. aberration effect and retardation effect ) .",

    "@xcite used the tpc and outer gap geometric models with @xmath53 and @xmath54 to obtain the light curves for psr j0034 - 0534 , and they derived similar conclusions that radio emission region extends from @xmath55 to @xmath56 and @xmath0-ray region extends from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "it is found that this msp has a larger transverse emission region for radio emission .",
    "moreover , @xcite developed the traditional outer gap and tpc model , adopting the similar idea of numerically assumed emissivity of piecewise - function , and derived the phase - aligned radio and @xmath0-ray light curves for three msps including psr j0034 - 0534 .",
    "it seems that psr j0034 - 0534 has off - peak pulsed @xmath0-ray emission up to 100% duty cycle @xcite , which is not reproduced by the annular gap model .",
    "this might be due to the lack of knowledge on emission geometry and magnetic field configuration , and we will further develop our model to study this msp in detail in the future .",
    "the observed light curves of psr j0101 - 6422 have complex features : the @xmath0-ray profile is likely to have three peaks ; while the radio profile contains three peaks that occupy nearly the whole rotation phase ( see left panels of figure 3 ) . to well model both light curves , we consider both cases of single - pole and two - pole emission - picture with many attempts on a large number of parameter space .",
    "the light curves of this msp favor a single - pole emission picture with @xmath53 and @xmath59 , and the results are shown in figure 3 . for a viewing angle of @xmath59 ,",
    "the radio interpeak originates from the core gap with high altitudes of @xmath60 to @xmath61 ; while the other two peaks with a bridge ( at the phases of @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) originate from the annular gap with altitudes of @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray profile is similar , the interpeak ( at phase of @xmath66 ) mainly originates from the core gap with high altitudes of @xmath67 to @xmath55 , while the other two peaks originate from the annular gap with altitudes of @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "according to the annular gap model , we note that the radio emission from psr j0101 - 6422 is quite asymmetric in magnetic azimuth .",
    "this is possibly due to the special physical coherence condition and propagation effects in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "we add some discussions on radio emission in  4 .",
    "psr j0437 - 4715 is a very close msp with a distance of 0.16kpc to the earth @xcite , and has multi - wavelength emission .",
    "@xcite suggested that psr j0437 - 4715 was an aligned rotator .",
    "we therefore adopted a relatively small magnetic inclination angle as @xmath70 and a reasonable viewing angle as @xmath71 from the high - precision radio timing observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite also used the value of @xmath71 to successfully model the thermal x - ray pulsations of this msp .",
    "we apply our annular gap model to jointly simulate its radio and @xmath0-ray light curves , and the results are shown in figure 4 .",
    "we emphasize that the radio interpulse can be reproduced by our model , although it does not precisely match the observations . the radio emission including the main peak and interpulse originate from a much higher and narrower region in the annular gap region with high altitudes of @xmath72 to @xmath73 ; while the @xmath0-ray emission is generated in the annular gap region with lower altitudes of @xmath74 to @xmath75 located in the same magnetic pole .",

    "both bands are mainly generated in the annular gap region co - located at intermediate altitudes . for psr j0101 - 6422 with complex radio and @xmath0-ray pulse profiles",
    ", we presented the best simulated results for this type of msps .",
    "the radio interpulse originate from the core gap at higher altitudes ; while the other two radio peaks with a bridge originate from the annular gap region .",
    "the interpeak originates from the core gap region and the other two peak from the annular gap region . for psr j0437 - 4715 with a large radio lag , the radio emission ( including the interpulse ) originates from a much higher and narrower region in the annular gap region , and the @xmath0-ray emission has lower altitudes .    from simulations of these msps",
    ", the annular gap model favors a single - pole emission pattern with small inclination angles ( @xmath77 ) for msps .",
    "this result is compatible with theories of magnetic field evolution of msps in binaries : some recycled pulsars tend to have aligning magnetic filed moment , i.e. small magnetic inclination angle @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a concrete discussion on the @xmath4 evolution of msps while they were recycling in low mass x - ray binaries , and they note that the strong interactions between spinning superfluid neutrons and magnetized superconducting protons in a pulsar s core force the spin axis to change .",
    "a msp would be an aligned rotator ( @xmath78 ) if the star s north and south magnetic poles are forced toward opposite spin poles by the accretion disk , or would be an orthogonal rotator ( @xmath79 ) if both of the star s magnetic poles are forced toward the same spin pole .",
    "moreover , it is certainly unclear what happens when a msp s recycling process finishes , @xcite analyzed the new pulse width data of normal pulsars , and found that the spin and magnetic axes would align when they spin down due to dipole radiation and particle outflowing .    several msps",
    "are simply assumed to be nearly orthogonal rotators because they have a radio interpulse separated by a large phase of @xmath80 from its main pulse @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied multi - wavelength light curves for two msps ( psr b1937 + 21 and psr b1957 + 20 ) , and found that fitting the radio polarization data of psr b1937 + 21 favors an orthogonal rotator . as with most",
    "rvm fits the confidence area is large but the orthogonal configuration is further supported by the altitude - limited tpc and outer gap models .",
    "however , this is not universally true , at least in the case of the annular gap model .",
    "the radio light curve of msps ( e.g. psr j0437 - 4715 ) with an interpulse can be well explained by the annular gap model with a small magnetic inclination angle .    by simulating light curves for msps in the annular gap model",
    ", we found that the radio emission mainly originates from the high - altitude narrow region in the annular gap region .",
    "the radio emission pattern ( photon sky - map ) is patch - like in our model .",
    "the radio emissivities on each field line ( in the annular gap or core gap ) vary slightly ( nearly uniform ) , but the case for @xmath0-ray light - curve simulation is quite different , they vary a lot .",
    "high energy ( @xmath0-ray and x - ray ) emission is generated by non - coherent radiation from relativistic primary particles and pairs , while radio emission is suggested to be generated by coherent radiation due to two - stream instability of outward and inward pairs @xcite .",
    "here we focus on studying radio and @xmath0-ray light curves for msps , the concrete emission mechanism including polarization , spectral properties and long - term stabilities of radio lags are however needed to further study , considering the coherent condition and propagation effects .",
    "@xcite systematically studied the radio circular polarization for pulsar integrated pulse profiles , and found that sense reversals of circular polarization are observed across the conal emission in some cases , unrestricted to core components .",
    "the polarization property of high - altitude radio emission from both annular and core gaps is a valuable subject to be investigated in future .",
    "we will keep on improving our model to present better simulated light curves , especially for the phases of leading wing of peak 1 , trailing wing of peak 2 and off - peak pulses .    in this paper",
    ", we simulated radio and gamma - ray light curves for 3 msps .",
    "when high signal - to - noise data at other wavelengths is available in the future , we will re - simulate light curves and fit the multi - wavelength phase - resolved spectra . in sum ,",
    "the annular gap model is a self - consistent model not only for young pulsars @xcite , but also for msps , and multi - wavelength light curves can be well explained by this model .",
