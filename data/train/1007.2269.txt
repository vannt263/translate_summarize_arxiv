    "the unification of standard model and general relativity is one of the most intriguing and desirous goals of modern physics , and it has stimulated many theoretical ideas towards quantum gravity ( qg ) .",
    "some of them predict lorentz violation ( lv ) , where the lorentz symmetry of space - time breaks down at high energies , and it introduces some tiny `` lv relics '' at lower energies .",
    "this probability has arisen in the space - time foam  @xcite , loop gravity  @xcite , vacuum condensate of tensor fields  @xcite , and the so - called doubly special relativity ( dsr ; also known as the deformed special relativity )  @xcite .",
    "lv is an important issue in qg theories , mainly because it provides some available scenarios to validate or falsify theories through `` windows on qg ''  @xcite .",
    "generally , we know that the quantum - gravitational effects are relevant only when the energy approaches the planck energy , @xmath2  gev .",
    "this huge number is obviously out of reach in the foreseeable future .",
    "however , at lower energies , the `` relic '' effects can demonstrate themselves and produce a modified energy - momentum dispersion relation with extra terms suppressed by @xmath3 . here",
    "the power @xmath4 and the coefficient @xmath5 both depend on the specific theoretical framework under consideration  @xcite .    to see the manifestations of the lorentz - violating physics , novel insights are needed , and fortunately , some have already been proposed practically to probe tiny modifications to conventional physics .",
    "accurate measurements in the laboratories on the earth  @xcite , violating processes in astrophysics with energetic particles  @xcite , and accumulated effects through cosmological amplification mechanisms  @xcite , are three basic considerations till now to reveal new physics arisen in the lv scenarios .    here",
    "we try to review and discuss some candidate theories on lv , and then utilize the modified energy - momentum dispersion relation to search observational clues in the photon sector ( sometimes jointly , the electron and positron sectors ) .",
    "high energy photons originated from astrophysics are extremely promising to probe or falsify lv theories in various aspects  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , several selected underlying models are briefly reviewed and discussed with the most recent observational constraints . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we focus on photons from astrophysical sources",
    ". these photons can reveal lv effects through their time - of - flight with energy - dependent velocities , and their interactions with low energy background photons , namely the extra - galactic background light ( ebl ) and/or the @xmath6 k cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiations .",
    "multi - tev @xmath7-rays may also be involved in self - decays into @xmath8 pairs with proper lv parameters . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , the most updating lv constraints from the spectra of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) are reviewed and discussed .",
    "[ sec5 ] summaries the paper with discussions on several current and upcoming instruments related to lv physics .",
    "in a rough manner , lv theories can mainly be classified into two categories .",
    "one is effective field theory ( eft ) , which provides an excellent framework where tiny lv effects are introduced into the lagrangian through lv operators  renormalizable ones with mass dimension 3 and/or 4 , see , _ e.g. _ , the standard model extension ( sme )  @xcite , and the further extended non - renormalizable ones with mass dimension 5 and/or 6  @xcite .",
    "the other category includes those qg theories that can not be embedded into the eft framework , such as the quantum space - time foam model  @xcite and dsr  @xcite .    in the eft framework ,",
    "all renormalizable operators , which guarantee the gauge symmetry preserved , are introduced by colladay and kosteleck  @xcite perturbatively and elegantly .",
    "the lv terms can be characterized by dimensionless tiny coefficients of order @xmath9 or even smaller .",
    "lately , myers and pospelov  @xcite proposed dimension-5 non - renormalizable lv terms into the eft lagrangian .",
    "the dimension-5 cpt - odd terms in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) read as  @xcite , @xmath10 while the dimension-5 cpt - even terms appear as  @xcite @xmath11 in above lagrangians , @xmath12 is a fixed timelike four - vector indicating the preferred frame , which is usually chosen as the frame where the cmb radiation is isotropic ; @xmath13 is the dual of @xmath14 , defined as @xmath15 ; @xmath16 are projection operators , and @xmath17 is the qed covariant derivative ; @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are dimensionless lv coefficients naturally expected to be of order @xmath21 . lately , the dimension-6 cpt - even terms are also introduced , by mattingly  @xcite , @xmath22    we can see that in the non - renormalizable eft , the lv terms are spontaneously suppressed by @xmath23 or @xmath24 , compared to the renormalizable lv terms with tiny coefficients of order @xmath9 put in by hand  @xcite .",
    "however , there remains a `` naturalness problem ''  @xcite in the non - renormalizable eft  radiative corrections may generate `` baby '' renormalizable terms which subsequently become even more important than the original `` parent '' non - renormalizable operators .",
    "luckily , supersymmetry can play a role to prevent or alleviate this problem  @xcite .    from the above lagrangians",
    ", we finally arrive at the modified energy - momentum dispersion relations for photons and fermions , respectively , @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the rest mass of fermions , and @xmath28 are combinations of @xmath19 and/or @xmath29  @xcite , where their subscribes `` @xmath30 '' denote two opposite helicities . in the eft , @xmath31 , and @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath33 is not necessary to equal to @xmath34 in general . for more details on non - renormalizable eft calculations and related issues ,",
    "see _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite .    from aspects of observational limits ,",
    "unfortunately , the dimension-5 operators seem unnatural , even with supersymmetry included and softly broken  @xcite .",
    "the linear energy dependence in eft is largely unfavored  @xcite .",
    "the most strict observations come from the vacuum birefringence and synchrotron radiations  @xcite .",
    "so we would like to fix @xmath35 in the following analysis , and impose @xmath36 for simplicity ( denoted as @xmath37 hereafter ; liberati and maccione also treated eft in the same way in ref .",
    "this choice preserves cpt symmetry and helicity symmetry , though they are not the essential ingredients generally .",
    "there are also several models where the local description in terms of effective lagrangian breaks down . for instance , ellis _",
    "proposed a liouville - inspired stringy analogue of space - time foam model  @xcite . in this model",
    ", a gas of d - particles roams in the bulk space - time of a high - dimension cosmology , wherein our universe is represented as a d3-brane .",
    "photons are represented by open strings .",
    "their interaction with d - particles excites and stretches the strings , and then decays and emits photons .",
    "thus `` gravitational medium effects '' modify the canonical dispersion relation of photons to include an lv term which depends linearly on the energies of photons , @xmath38 $ ] , while the dispersion relation for charged particles remains untouched and no helicity dependence is predicted  @xcite .",
    "hence , it avoids many tight constraints from the vacuum birefringence of photons , the electron / positron sector , and the uhecrs sector  @xcite .",
    "most recently , ref .",
    "@xcite claimed that the space - time foam model is unable to explain simultaneously the time lags of tev @xmath7-rays , and the non - observation of high energy photons above eev .",
    "however , ellis , mavromatos , and nanopoulos argued that there are ways to avoid the constraints  @xcite , hence the issue is still in dispute . on the other hand , the time - of - flight of photons from distant @xmath7-ray bursts ( grbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agns )",
    "strikingly favors the linearly energy dependent lv corrections  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it still has strong motivations and advantages to study this linearly dependent lv theory .",
    "the above discussed lv theories are far from complete .",
    "especially , dsr  @xcite is a well - motivated candidate where two invariant scales are included , namely the velocity of low energy photons , _",
    "i.e. _ , the conventional light speed @xmath39 , and a length scale @xmath40 ( or equivalently , an energy scale @xmath41 ) . in the dsr",
    ", the energy - momentum conservation laws may also be modified  @xcite , thus brings further complications to the analysis of lv phenomena . in this paper , the canonical energy - momentum conservation is assumed .    for a phenomenologically uniform description ,",
    "we use the following dispersion relations , for photons and fermions , respectively , @xmath42 \\,,\\ ] ] @xmath43\\,,\\ ] ] where only @xmath44 ( the linear modification ) and @xmath45 ( the quadratic modification ) are currently observationally relevant .",
    "more specifically , we should keep in mind that the case with @xmath46 , @xmath47 corresponds to the space - time foam model , while the case with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 represents the dimension-6 eft with cpt - even lv operators . in addition , the case with @xmath51 , @xmath52 is also of great interests , for the reason that it can be a consequence of the geometrically small scale of space - time and the equivalence principle to all species of particles .",
    "as the dispersion relations are modified , we can suspect extra lv impacts beyond the standard model .",
    "the tiny corrections can be magnified when the energy @xmath53 is large , and also maybe through cosmological amplification mechanisms .",
    "hence when two magnification mechanisms are combined , the astrophysical photons with very high energies provide plentiful motivations to be regarded as an important source to investigate lv physics .",
    "the dynamics of lv is poorly understood , hence we focus on the kinematics of photon propagation from distant galaxies towards us .",
    "the effect of lv on high energy photon propagation is threefold .",
    "firstly , the velocity of photons , defined as @xmath54 , is no longer a constant , according to eq .",
    "( [ photon ] ) .",
    "consequently , photons with different energies spend slightly different time - of - flight to arrive at the earth .",
    "it was firstly recognized in refs .",
    "@xcite , and is discussed extensively by the scientific society with great passion recently on the fermi , magic , and hess observations  @xcite . secondly , the modified dispersion relation may allow the strictly forbidden reactions in the lorentz - symmetric theories to occur , such as photon decay , @xmath55 .",
    "it results in a cutoff in the spectra of @xmath7-rays above the decay threshold .",
    "thirdly , high energy photons interact with low energy background photons ( cmb and/or ebl ) on the way of propagation , through the reaction @xmath56 ; lv effects can influence the threshold of this process , and lead to interesting phenomena  @xcite .",
    "we discuss the above three scenarios in the following .",
    "worthy to stress that , since the lorentz symmetry is broken in the lv theory , the transformation laws between two relatively moving frames are unknown , hence the laboratory system is the only proper frame to discuss relevant physics before we get access to proper transformation laws .",
    "amelino - camelia _ et al . _",
    "@xcite first suggested using grbs to test lv physics . due to the large cosmological distance and the fine time structure of grbs ,",
    "tiny lv effects can be amplified into observable quantities . by taking into account cosmological expansion of the universe , the time lag induced by the lv modified dispersion relation between photons with high energies @xmath57 , and",
    "those with low energies @xmath58 , is  @xcite , @xmath59 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 stand for linear and quadratic energy dependence ; @xmath60  km  s@xmath61  mpc@xmath61 is the hubble expansion constant ; @xmath62 is the vacuum energy density , and @xmath63 is the matter energy density in the current universe ; @xmath64 is the redshift of the source .",
    "fermi lat discovered that high energy photons have a tendency to arrive later relative to low energy ones  @xcite , which might present potential evidence for lv with @xmath65 for the space - time foam model or @xmath66 for the dimension-6 cpt - even eft .",
    "however , the determination of time lag from observational data is highly nontrivial and affected by many facets , both artificially and instrumentally  @xcite .",
    "the primary uncertainty comes from the unknown effects from source activities , mainly due to our imperfect knowledge of the radiation mechanism of grbs .",
    "however , we can separate the source effects if we can achieve a survey of grbs at different redshifts  @xcite .",
    "the time lag induced by lv accumulates with propagation distance , as it is a gravitational medium effect . on the contrary ,",
    "the intrinsic source induced lag is likely to be a distance - independent quantity , which can be approximated as a constant .",
    "the relation between the observed delay @xmath67 and the intrinsic time lag @xmath68 is @xmath69 in ref .",
    "@xcite , we systematically studied this scenario of fermi lat grbs , and got the quantum gravity scale @xmath70  gev for the linear energy dependence , which corresponds to @xmath71 .",
    "worthy to mention that , @xmath72 represents superluminal photon propagation , while @xmath73 corresponds to subluminal propagation .",
    "the time - of - flight of high energy photons is the clearest test to search lv effects of the photon sector , hence provides the most convincing results .",
    "agns and pulsars are also utilized to study lv effects through time - of - flight analysis  @xcite .",
    "the observational results that high energy photons arrive relatively later than low energy ones suggest a negative @xmath5 , and current data largely favor linearly energy dependent lv effects  @xcite",
    ".      the alteration of the dispersion relations of photons and fermions might also lead to some peculiar reactions to occur , like the basic qed vertex @xmath1 , called photon decay , which is generally forbidden by the canonical energy - momentum conservation in the standard model .",
    "photon decay might be realistic in the framework of lv theories with proper lv parameters .",

    "( [ pd ] )  @xcite .",
    "we consider three theoretical scenarios in the following .",

    "( [ pd ] ) reduces to @xmath82 \\xi_1 $ ] .",
    "we can see clearly that @xmath83 leads to @xmath84 , which is the very case in the standard model where no photon decay is kinematically allowed . for @xmath85",
    ", there is no meaningful solution for the photon decay process . on the contrary , for @xmath86 , any high energy photon with its momentum larger than @xmath87 would decay rapidly into an @xmath8 pair  @xcite , thus we are not supposed to observe photons with momentum larger than @xmath88 from astrophysical sources .    on the other hand , the observation of multi - tev photons can cast a constraint on the lv parameter @xmath89 from the @xmath86 side  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath89 is of order @xmath90 , then the relevant energy lays within the currently observational capability .",
    "actually , the observations of the @xmath91 and @xmath92 photons from the crab nebula  @xcite have already constrained @xmath89 to be less than @xmath93 in this scenario .",
    "it should be noticed that , here the power dependence of @xmath94 on @xmath89 , @xmath95 , differs from that of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath96 , because there the energy dependence of lv in terms of the maximal attainable velocity  @xcite is different from that of the space - time foam model .",
    "however , in the relevant energy range , the results are roughly the same .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath97 if the modification of the dispersion relation is due to pure planck - scale geometry of space - time , and the equivalence principle applies to all species of particles , then the fermions ( electrons and positrons ) share the same lv parameters as the photons . and if the dispersion relation is modified to the first order , _",
    "i.e. _ , linearly energy dependent , then from eq .",
    "( [ pd ] ) , the energy - momentum conservation leads to @xmath98 \\xi_1 $ ] .",
    "thus again , for @xmath99 , no photon decay is allowed , and for @xmath100 , there exists a threshold for photons with momentum larger than @xmath101 to decay .",
    "this is also within the energy range of observational practicability if the lv parameters are of order @xmath90 .",
    "\\(iii ) @xmath102 in the above two cases , the threshold happens when @xmath103 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the electron and the positron in the final state have the same amount of momentum . however , this is not a general property in the lv photon decay phenomenon , as first pointed out by jacobson , liberati and mattingly  @xcite .    in the dimension-6 cpt",
    "- even eft framework , lv terms of photons and fermions both depend quadratically on the energy .",
    "now eq .  ( [ pd ] )",
    "is reduced to @xmath104 \\times \\left [ \\xi_2 - \\eta_2 \\left((1-x)^{3}+x^{3}\\right ) \\right]$ ] , where the right - hand side is quartic of @xmath105 if @xmath106 , and the discussions to derive the threshold energy become more subtle .",
    "if @xmath107 , then it is a similar case as the space - time foam model , where @xmath108 corresponds to no photon decay , while @xmath109 leads to a threshold at @xmath110 .     and",

    ", we can get the `` phase diagram '' for photon decay in the dimension-6 cpt - even eft , illustrated in fig .",

    "however , in some other phase space , the asymmetric momentum configuration of final state may appear , namely that the electron and the positron gain different proportions of the initial momentum , satisfying @xmath122 ( @xmath123/2 \\neq 1/2 $ ] thereof )  @xcite .",
    "besides , there is also a regime where no photon decays can ever happen .    from the above discussions",
    ", we can see that within different theories , there can be a cutoff in the @xmath7-ray spectra above a threshold energy with lv parameters in some certain regions .",
    "the cutoff is predominant , instead of a suppression , because the time scale of the photon decay is quite short and the process takes place in no time compared to their time - of - flight  @xcite .",
    "thus , the photon decay feature is obvious in the photon spectra if it exists , and hence should be observed explicitly .",
    "the @xmath45 case has the cutoff energy four orders higher than that of the @xmath44 case , thus it is more challenging to practical observations .",
    "however , the observations concerning the quadratic lv modification , as well as the linear lv modification , are already emerging .",
    "another interesting phenomenon comes from the interaction of a high energy photon @xmath7 with a low energy photon @xmath124 through the pair - production reaction @xmath125 .",
    "cmb is the relic radiation from the big bang which evolutes in the expanding universe after the lights decouple with the matters .",
    "and ebl is the faint diffuse light of the sky , consisting of the historically accumulated flux of all extragalactic sources .",
    "it is relevant for the formation of stars and galaxies , and also the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "its wavelength varies from the radio band to the ultraviolet band .",
    "the observed spectra of high energy photons from distant galaxies are modified on the way of propagation , due to the attenuation by these low energy background `` absorbers '' .",
    "the presence of lv will change the reaction threshold and modify the reaction patterns in an intriguing and physically meaningful manner  @xcite .",
    "it can be extended to the ultra - high energy photons , as well as the uhecrs , without any further difficulties  @xcite .",
    "this might be the most extensively investigated scenario among the lv - induced `` windows on qg ''",
    "the lv effects depend on the energy of photons involved , and the magnitude and also the sign of the lv parameters , as well as the theoretical framework under considerations .",
    "as we can see in the photon decay section , different parameter configurations lead to different lv physical phenomena .",
    "since four particles are involved in the pair - production absorption , we naturally expect more subtle and complicated dependence on the phase space of lv parameters than the photon decay case .",
    "_ provided the most detailed discussions on this issue  @xcite . here",
    "we look into two possible scenarios which are the most relevant and well constrained from observational aspects : ( i ) the propagation of multi - tev photons  @xcite , ( ii ) the photo - meson production through the gzk mechanism and the subsequently pion - produced photons with energies above eev  @xcite .",
    "we would work in the simple framework provided by jacob and piran  @xcite , who studied the linearly lv suppressed scenarios in a clear manner .",
    "assuming that the lv parameters of fermions vanish , then by utilizing the `` threshold theorem ''  @xcite , we can arrive at the threshold of the low energy background lights to interact with an incidental photon with energy @xmath126",
    "@xcite , @xmath127 @xmath128 leads to the conventional case @xmath129 , of course .",
    "if the lv parameters of electrons and positrons are also introduced , the lv modified patterns are hardly further modified .",
    "it only introduces a numerical rescaling of order @xmath130 for the second term in eq .",
    "( [ abeq ] ) , by assuming the likely magnitude of the lv parameters of fermions compared to that of photons  @xcite .",
    "thus we here ignore them for simplicity .    in the superluminal propagation case with @xmath131 , the photon decay process dominates , where it results in a cutoff , and no photons are observable above energy larger than the decay threshold .",
    "thus we focus on the subluminal case with @xmath132 here .",
    "it is easily seen that there is a minimum on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ abeq ] ) .",
    "the minimum appears as the most crucial feature from the pair - production absorption within lv theories  @xcite .",
    "firstly , it means that the background photons with energies lower than the minimum never interact with the high energy photons .",
    "secondly , most importantly , lv predicts a `` reemergence '' of the high energy photon flux when the incidental photons have energies above the critical energy  @xcite , @xmath133^{1/(n+2 ) } \\,.\\ ] ] for the @xmath44 case , @xmath134 , while for the @xmath45 case , @xmath135 .",
    "the critical energies are of the same order as the threshold energies of photon decays , because the photon decay can be viewed as a high energy @xmath7-ray photon interacting with a `` low '' energy one with infinite wavelength ( therefore zero energy actually ) .",
    "thus photon decay is a special case of the reaction @xmath125 with a vanishing @xmath124 .    above the critical energy , with the energies of high energy photons increasing , the threshold of low energy photons to interact also increases . in the relevant energy range ,",
    "the photon density of the background lights decreases with energy .",
    "hence , there are less low energy photons to annihilate with high energy photons above the critical energy , therefore , a recovery of the high energy photon flux is expected in the lv theories above the critical point  @xcite .    as for the photons with energies above eev , galaverni and sigl",
    "considered the ultra - high energy photons from gzk - cutoff - induced pion decays  @xcite . in their work ,",
    "the lv parameters for the electron and the positron are also fully taken under considerations .",
    "for the non - lv case , these ultra - high energy photons would interact with the cmb photons and lead to a cutoff in the spectra ( actually , a suppression here ) above the pair - production threshold . and",
    "if lv - corrected terms exist in the dispersion relations , as shown above , the threshold will shift and there is a reemergence above some critical energy if @xmath136 .",
    "hence , it is supposed to observe the `` reemergent flux '' through auger , agasa , and yakutsk observations , according to numerical calculations  @xcite .",
    "however , these observations only find upper limits for photon flux in the relevant energy range .",
    "the non - observation situation allows very tight constraints on lv parameters",

    "due to the most violating processes and long baseline propagations in astrophysics , there has been accumulating significant constraints for lv parameters from the astrophysical society  @xcite . aside from the above mentioned scenarios ,",
    "other processes are also taken under considerations by many authors and have achieved good progresses on the lv issues , _",

    "uhecrs are among the most studied phenomena of lv for historical and practical reasons . in a certain period of time",
    ", people doubted whether a `` standard '' gzk cutoff exists , and many models are proposed to account for the `` shift '' or `` disappearance '' of the gzk cutoff . among them , the lv explanation was a promising candidate .",

    "small derivations from lorentz symmetry are still under serious considerations .",

    ", we believe that they are protons or heavy ions",
    ". then uhecrs are composite entities instead of fundamental particles , and their underlying degrees of freedom are actually quarks and gluons .",

    "hence , it provides the most convincing evidence for lv effects on the photon sector .",
    "time - of - flight analysis favors linear energy dependence within current observations .",
    "however , the results are contradictory with other constraints from kinematics of reactions , where the linearly corrected lv terms are constrained to be very unlikely  @xcite .",
    "even the stringy space - time foam model , where no corrections for charged particles are predicted thus avoiding many constraints from charged species , is debatably unfavored by the non - observation of the ultra - high energy photon flux  @xcite .",
    "as for species other than photons , _",
    "e.g. _ , electrons , positrons , quarks , and gluons , they can enjoy their own individual lv parameters differing from those of photons in principle . in some theories , particles with different helicities",
    "can also possess unrelated lv parameters .",
    "thus lots of lv parameters are involved totally , and detailed analysis is needed and fortunately is performing to constrain all these tiny lv terms  @xcite . since most reactions contain more than one species , combined analysis is severely in demand .",
    "as we can see from the photon decays in the dimension-6 cpt - even eft , the lv physics generally depends highly , sometimes even nonlinearly , on the phase space of lv parameters .",
    "many efforts are still focusing to combine constraints from different types of analysis to derive a robust result  @xcite . as for composite particles , the jump from fundamental degrees of freedom to the compounded entities , _",
    "e.g. _ , the protons and the heavy ions in the uhecrs , requires more careful arguments and treatments .",
    "lorentz violation ( lv ) may arise from many quantum gravity ( qg ) models . and apart from its origin",
    ", it is apparently important for its own sake .",
    "theoretically , lv physics can originate from stringy considerations , effective field theories ( efts ) , doubly special relativity , loop gravity theories , and so on .",
    "correspondingly , fruitful and intriguing phenomena emerge from lv corrections , and fortunately they are testable on several operating platforms from various aspects nowadays , _",
    "e.g. _ , the fermi satellite and the pierre auger collaboration .",
    "this issue becomes more and more attractive to the scientific society nowadays , because evidence and constraints from experiments and observations are appearing continuously and steadily reachable and reliable .",
    "the most promising standpoint of the testability comes from the modified energy - momentum dispersion relation , where extra lv terms are introduced through different theoretical scenarios , compared to the canonical energy - momentum relation , @xmath0 .    in this paper , we extensively review the studies of the lv influence on the astrophysical photons with very high energies .",
    "they are classified into three categories : ( i ) the velocity of photons @xmath147 now depends on the wavelength of the light , hence introduces a time lag between photons with different energies , which can be observed from @xmath7-ray bursts ( grbs ) and the flares of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ; ( ii ) newfangled reactions that are strictly forbidden in the standard model due to the non - conservation of energy - momentum might happen within lv theories , and a cutoff of photon flux above the threshold energy of photon decay , @xmath148 , is expected with proper lv parameters ; ( iii ) lv also alters the threshold energy of normal reactions , hence the spectra of the very high energy photons can be renewed to provide physically intriguing phenomena , due to the modified patterns of the reaction @xmath149 , for multi - tev photons and eev photons through interacting with low energy background lights .    to search for the lv physics in above scenarios ,",
    "there are several indispensable steps .",
    "most importantly , more sensitive detectors should play a decisive role , since generally , the higher the energy , the more diluted the flux .",
    "currently , the auger collaboration and the hess collaboration are playing significant importance in relevant fields .",
    "an `` auger north '' array intending to behave better than the present southern hemisphere auger array is also under consideration .",
    "an improved knowledge of the astrophysically intrinsic mechanisms is also essential in searching lv physics from astrophysical side , _",
    "e.g. _ , the details of the background lights , the un - attenuated spectra of sources , the acceleration and radiation mechanisms of uhecrs .",
    "space - based satellites , fermi and the incoming `` extreme universe space observatory onboard japanese experiment module '' ( jem - euso ) are promising missions to pindown astrophysical issues . as we can see , lv physics reveals itself at high energy bands more obviously , thus the techniques to detect higher energy cosmic rays , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath150  ev , are also of great significance .    in summary ,",
    "theoretically , we can not predict the values of lv parameters in lv theories from the first principle most of the time though , fortunately , experimental and observational data are serving tight constraints from various aspects to falsify theories and/or to constrain the lv parameters .",
    "these observations have developed and are developing rapidly within new platforms nowadays . until now ,",
    "no explicit lv effects deviating from the special relativity are observed determinately , and many theoretical scenarios are ruling out .",
    "meanwhile , new clues of lv physics are emerging rapidly from astrophysical observations and ground - based laboratory experiments . in the following dozens of years",
    ", the lv issue is expected to meet a more clear situation then .",
