    "markarian 421 ( mrk421  hereafter ) is a nearby active galaxy with a featureless optical spectrum devoid of prominent emission or absorption lines , with strongly polarized variable optical and radio flux , and compact ( milli - arcsecond - scale ) radio emission . as such ,",
    "it is classified as a bllacertae type .",
    "its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is well described by a characteristic two - peak shape ( for a review , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the more general context of blazars ,",
    "mrk421  belongs to a subclass of the so - called high - energy - peaked bl  lacertae ( hbl ) objects , relatively low - luminosity sources with both peaks located at relatively high energies ( respectively at @xmath21  kev and @xmath2100  gev ) .",
    "mrk421  is among the closest and most comprehensively studied objects of the hbl class and is also the first extragalactic source detected in the very high energy @xmath0-ray band ( @xmath3100  gev , vhe hereafter ; @xcite ) .    the observed properties of mrk421 , as well as other similar blazars , are best explained as arising from a relativistic jet seen at a small angle to our line of sight @xcite .",
    "the nonthermal and polarized continuum observed from the radio band to the soft x - ray band suggests that this part of the sed is due to a distribution of relativistic electrons radiating via the synchrotron process .",
    "the radiation in the @xmath0-ray band is likely due to inverse - compton scattering by energetic electrons responsible for the synchrotron radiation , as confirmed by simultaneous , correlated variations in the low- and high - energy sed components ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the seed photons are most likely the synchrotron photons internal to the jet .",
    "such `` synchrotron self - compton '' ( ssc ) models , developed by many authors ( for early examples see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) have been successfully invoked to describe the full sed of hbl objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the range of measured flux of mrk421  spans up to two orders of magnitude in some spectral bands , with flares occurring on very short timescales ( a day or less ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "possibly the best bands to study such variability are the x - ray and vhe @xmath0-ray bands : in the context of the ssc model , they represent radiation from the most energetic electrons , which have the shortest timescales for radiative losses .",
    "the cross - correlation of time series measured in various bands provides additional clues to the radiative processes , the acceleration and energy distribution of radiating particles , and the structure and intrinsic power of the relativistic jet .",
    "the relative temporal variability in different spectral bands , from radio through vhe @xmath0-rays , provides an important handle on the location of the energy dissipation with respect to the central black hole @xcite . in the context of a specific model for the radiation ,",
    "the underlying particle distributions may be determined more or less directly from the observed multiwavelength seds .",
    "particle - acceleration mechanisms can then be constrained by the shape of those particle distributions .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration , an example of a first - order fermi ( fermi  i ) process , is generally associated with single power - law distributions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , log - parabolic distributions are produced in models of stochastic acceleration ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , which can be considered equivalent to a second - order fermi ( fermi  ii ) process .",
    "mrk421  and other hbl - type blazars have been extensively studied in the soft x - ray band ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , revealing a range of spectral slopes in various quiescent and flaring states .",
    "less is known about the hard x - ray ( @xmath4  kev ) properties of blazar jet emission : the data are far fewer and available mostly for flaring episodes , or averaged over relatively long timescales ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this energy band probes the most energetic and fastest varying tail of the distribution of synchrotron - radiating particles , and therefore represents an important diagnostic of the content of the jet and the processes responsible for the acceleration of particles to the highest energies .",
    "the inverse - compton component increases with energy , and could potentially contribute significantly to the hard x - ray band .",
    "if so , it would also provide a strong constraint on the low - energy part of the electron distribution , which is a significant , if not dominant , part of the total kinetic power of the jet .",
    "mrk421  observations were part of the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array ( _ nustar _ ; @xcite ) blazar program , aimed at advancing our understanding of astrophysical jets .",
    "the multiwavelength campaign focused on mrk421  was carried out between december 2012 and may 2013 , with three to four pointings per month , designed to maximize strictly simultaneous overlap with observations by the vhe @xmath0-ray facilities and @xmath5 .",
    "we also secured nearly simultaneous soft x - ray , optical and uv observations from the satellite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray data from _ fermi_-lat which observes mrk421  every 3 hours , was also used together with all the coordinated multiwavelength data .",
    "mrk421  varied in flux throughout the campaign , with a relatively low flux in the x - ray and vhe bands at the beginning , increasing to a major flare toward the end of the campaign . in this paper , we present part of the data collected during the first three months of the campaign with particular emphasis on the detailed shape of the x - ray spectrum , its variability and the correlated variability observed in vhe @xmath0-rays . we also report briefly on the observations of mrk421  prior to the start of the campaign , in july 2012 , when the object was used for calibration purposes during the in - orbit verification phase of _",
    "nustar_. during this period , mrk421  emission was broadly consistent with previously observed quiescent states , which we define here to be characterized by relatively low flux at all frequencies and by the absence of significant flaring ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the flaring period of the 2013 campaign will be covered in a separate publication .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  [",
    "sec : obs+data ] we describe the multiwavelength observations and data used in this paper .",
    "we dedicate  [ sec : nustar ] to a detailed characterization of the hard x - ray spectrum of mrk421  with _ nustar_. the results of the multiwavelength campaign in 2013 january  march are presented in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "discussion of the empirical results and modeling of the broadband properties are given in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , and in  [ sec : summary ] we summarize the main results .",
    "we adopt a distance of 141  mpc to mrk421 , calculated from its measured redshift @xmath6 ( based on absorption lines in the spectrum of the host galaxy ; @xcite ) and the cosmological parameters recently refined by the planck collaboration @xcite : @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) 40-meter telescope was used for observation at 15  ghz , as a part of a long - term blazar monitoring program .",
    "additional observations were scheduled at times of coordinated observations with x - ray and vhe @xmath0-ray observatories .",
    "the data were reduced using standard processing and calibration techniques described in detail in @xcite .",
    "radio observations of mrk421  between 2.64 and 142  ghz have been obtained within the framework of the f - gamma program @xcite , a @xmath0-ray blazar monitoring program related to the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope .",
    "observations with the effelsberg 100-meter and pico veleta 30-meter telescopes are performed roughly once per month .",
    "the effelsberg measurements are conducted with heterodyne receivers at 2.64 , 4.85 , 8.35 , 10.45 , 14.60 , 23.05 , and 32.0  ghz , while the pico veleta telescope is used with the emir receiver to provide the high - frequency ( 86.2 and 142.3  ghz ) flux measurements .",
    "standard data processing and calibration were performed as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the metshovi radio observatory 14-meter telescope also participated in this multi - instrument campaign , providing observations of mrk421  at 37  ghz every few days .",
    "details of the observing strategy and data reduction for this monitoring program can be found in @xcite .",
    "the coverage at optical frequencies was provided by various telescopes around the world within the gasp - webt program ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", the following observatories contributed to this campaign : teide ( iac80 ) , crimean , lowell ( perkins telescope ) , roque de los muchachos ( kva and liverpool telescopes ) , abastumani , pulkovo , st.petersburg , belogradchik , rozhen ( 50/70  cm , 60  cm and 200  cm telescopes ) , vidojevica and lulin .",
    "additionally , many observations were performed with itelescopes , bradford robotic telescope , rovor , and the tubitak national observatory . in this paper",
    ", we use only r - band photometry .",
    "the calibration stars reported in @xcite were used for calibration , and the galactic extinction was corrected with the reddening corrections given in @xcite .",
    "the flux from the host galaxy was estimated using the r - band flux from @xcite for the apertures of 5  and 7.5used by various instruments .",
    "we applied an offset of @xmath9  mjy to the fluxes from rovor in order to achieve better agreement with the light curves from the other instruments .",
    "this difference may be related to the specific spectral response of the filters used , or the different analysis procedures that were employed .",
    "additionally , a point - wise fluctuation of 2% on the measured flux was added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainties in order to account for potential day - to - day differences in observations with any of the instruments .",
    "polarization measurements are utilized from four observatories : lowell ( perkins telescope ) , st.petersburg , crimean , and steward ( bok telescope ) .",
    "the polarization measurements from lowell and st.petersburg observatories are derived from r - band imaging polarimetry .",
    "the measurements from steward observatory are derived from 40007550  band spectropolarimetry with a resolution of @xmath215 .",
    "the reported values are constructed from the median q / i and u / i in the 50007000  band . the effective wavelength of this bandpass is not too different from the kron - cousins r - band and the wavelength dependence in the polarization of mrk421  seen in the spectropolarimetry during this period is not strong enough to significantly affect the variability analysis of the measurements from various telescopes . the observing and data - processing procedures for the polarization measurements",
    "are described in .",

    "the count rate above 30  kev is dominated by the background on short timescales and is therefore not shown here .",
    "the differences in count rates between observations , and the range covered in each particular observation , are entirely dominated by the intrinsic variability of the target .",
    "for example , the calibration observation taken in july 2012 ( the top panel of figure  [ fig : nustar_count_rates ] ) includes a possible `` flare '' in which the count rate increased by a factor of 2.5 over a 12-hour period and dropped by almost a factor of 2 in 3  h. several observations in 2013 have shown steadily decreasing count rate over the course of @xmath44312  h. we did not observe any sharp increases followed by exponential decay typical of flaring events , although we can not exclude the possibility that the observed count rate decreases are due to such events .",
    "all of the observed increases in the count rate ( e.g. , 2012 july  7 and  8 , 2013 february  6 , as well as 2013 march  5 and  17 on a shorter timescale ) appear rather symmetric with respect to subsequent decreases .",
    "the campaign observations up to the end of march 2013 have predominantly covered relatively low - flux states of mrk421 , even though the lowest and the highest observed fluxes span almost an order of magnitude .",
    "the observed count rates are not consistent with a constant flux during any of the observations .",
    "however , the dominant variations in the count rate can be described as smooth on a timescale of several hours .",
    "if a simple exponential decay fit , @xmath533 , is performed on the observations that show significant downward trends ( 2012 july  8 , 2013 january  15 , february  12 and  17 , march  5 and  12 ) , the typical decay timescale ( @xmath534 ) is found to be between 6 and 12  h. these rough fits are not meant to describe the light curves fully , but only to provide an estimate of the timescale on which the flux changes significantly . for the remainder of the paper we use @xmath535  hours as our best estimate of this timescale .    in order to characterize the variability on shorter timescales ( @xmath536 )",
    ", we consider the data in individual _ nustar _  orbits as this represents a natural , albeit still arbitrary , way of partitioning the data .",
    "the _ nustar _",
    "orbits are approximately 90  minutes long and contain roughly 50  minutes of source exposure .",
    "we treat each orbit independently and fit two simple light - curve models to the observed count rates : a constant flux during the orbit , @xmath537constant , and a linear trend in time , i.e. ,  @xmath538 .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : nustar_var ] provides an example of both models fitted to the july 2012 data binned into 10-minute time bins , so that each orbit is divided into 57 bins per focal - plane module .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : nustar_var ] shows the results of this fitting procedure performed on all 88 orbits .",
    "we find that the flux during the majority of orbits is better described by a linear trend than by a constant - flux model .",
    "linear trends account for most of the orbit - to - orbit variability and approximate smooth variations on super - orbital timescales of @xmath539  hours . in 10-minute bins , for example",
    ", the variability amplitude typically does not exceed the observed count rate uncertainty of 3% .",
    "based on the mildly overpopulated tail of the reduced-@xmath540 distribution for the linear - trend fits , we estimate that up to 20% of orbits show excess variance beyond the simple linear trend .",
    "subtracting that trend and comparing the residual scatter to the median rate uncertainty within each orbit , @xmath531 , gives a distribution slightly skewed towards values greater than unity ( see lower right panel of figure  [ fig : nustar_var ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with intrinsic suborbital variability on a @xmath210-minute timescale in @xmath52720% of orbits , while for the majority of the observations the short - timescale variability can be constrained to have a @xmath5275% amplitude .",
    "these results are independent of the exact choice of the bin size , and hold for any subhour binning . based on a separate analysis of the low- and high - flux data alone",
    ", we do not find significant evidence for a change in variability characteristics with flux .",

    "we combine spectra for each focal - plane module separately due to intrinsic differences in response matrices .",
    "spectra from both modules are fitted simultaneously in @xmath5 , just like the observation - averaged and the single - orbit ones .",
    "note that this procedure implicitly assumes that the source behaves self - consistently , in the sense that a particular flux level corresponds to a unique spectral shape within the data - taking time interval .",
    "the validity of this assumption is further discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we first stack the spectra of three complete observations ( 2013 january 2 , 10 and 20 ) , since mrk421  displayed a nearly - constant low flux during all three ( see figure  [ fig : nustar_count_rates ] ) .",

    "we combine the spectra of all 88 orbits according to their 37  kev flux in order to obtain higher s / n for the flux states covered in the data set .",
    "the choice of flux bins shown with black symbols in figure  [ fig : nustar_flux_trends ] is such that relatively uniform uncertainty in spectral parameters is achieved across the flux range ; this condition requires stacking of @xmath210 orbits of data on the faint end , while a single orbit is sufficient at the bright end .",
    "the results , however , are largely independent of the exact choice of which orbits to combine into a particular flux bin . fitting the stacked spectra with the same simple spectral models as before reveals spectral trends much more clearly than for observation - averaged or time - separated spectra , as shown by black symbols in figure  [ fig : nustar_flux_trends ] .",
    "the spectra of the lowest - flux stack and the highest - flux orbit are displayed in figure  [ fig : nustar_full_obs_spectra ] for comparison with the observation - averaged spectra .",
    "the analysis performed here describes the spectral changes happening between those two extremes as a smooth function of the x - ray flux .    for each of the parameters of the power - law , broken power - law and log - parabolic models we parametrize their dependence on the x - ray flux as @xmath668 where @xmath669 stands for any of the spectral parameters ( @xmath640 , @xmath651 , @xmath642 , @xmath643 , @xmath645 , @xmath646 ) , @xmath670 is the slope of the relation , @xmath671 is the 37  kev flux , @xmath672 is a reference flux in ergs@xmath532 ( chosen to be the median flux of our dataset , @xmath673 ) and @xmath674 is the vertical offset ( parameter value at the reference flux ) .",
    "we find that in all cases this linear function adequately describes the general trends . since we find that the break energy of the broken power - law model ( @xmath642 ) is independent of flux within its large uncertainties , we keep it fixed at 7  kev while fitting for the trends in the @xmath651 and @xmath643 parameters . for @xmath643 , the high - energy photon index of the broken power - law model , the best - fit slope is small , but different from zero at the 2@xmath526 level .",
    "for the rest of the spectral parameters , the trends are statistically more significant .",

    "finally , we briefly return to the broken power - law model fits only to make a comparison to the previously observed spectral variability during flares .",
    "the @xmath676  kev data analysed by @xcite overlap in the 210  kev flux only for the highest - flux single - orbit data presented here , and extends almost a decade above that .",
    "these authors showed that the break energy is essentially independent of flux and @xmath677  kev ( 68% confidence interval ) , which is consistent with the median value of approximately 7  kev found from our nondegenerate fits of the broken power - law model . the photon indices were found to vary with flux up to approximately @xmath678  erg  s@xmath532  @xmath445 , above which they saturate at @xmath679 and @xmath680 .",

    "detection of such a correlation in a low state was reported for the first time in @xcite , using the x - ray ( @xmath5 , @xmath5 ) and vhe ( magic , @xmath5 ) data obtained during the 4.5-month multiwavelength campaign in 2009 , when mrk421  did not show any flaring activity and varied around its typical 0.310  kev count rates of @xmath225  s@xmath532 and vhe flux of 0.5  crab units . in this section",

    "flux correlation in the x - ray and vhe bands with higher confidence , during a period of even lower activity .",
    "we also study the characteristics of such a correlation in different x - ray bands using the strictly simultaneous @xmath5 , _ nustar _ , and observations .",
    "we summarize the results in figure  [ fig : xray - vhe_fluxflux ] for three nonoverlapping x - ray bands .",
    "the flux in each band was calculated from the best - fit broadband model ( power - law , or log - parabolic where needed ; see  [ sec : nustar ] ) .    in the following , we use the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) and the associated uncertainty as defined in @xcite .",
    "we carried out the correlation analysis on two timescales : a  @xmath21-hour timescale , using strictly simultaneous observations , and a  @xmath5271-day timescale , using data averaged over complete 610-hour observations ( i.e. ,  averaged over one night of observations with each of the vhe observatories )",
    ". figure  [ fig : nustar_count_rates ] shows the exact overlap of the _ nustar _  and vhe observations .",
    "for both timescales and for all three x - ray bands we find significant correlations between fluxes in log  log space : dcf@xmath688 in all cases , with typical uncertainty of 0.10.2 .",
    "the dcf is therefore inconsistent with zero with a minimum significance of 3.5@xmath526 ( nightly - averaged fluxes , 730  kev band ) and maximum significance of 15@xmath526 ( simultaneous data , 37  kev band ) . as a sanity check",

    "note that we compute the correlation coefficients and dcf values using the logarithm of flux : because of greater dynamic range , the true flux ",
    "flux correlations are even more significant .",
    "the similar slope of the @xmath690 correlation on both timescales may indicate that the correlation is mainly driven by flux variability on a timescale of several days , i.e. , between different observations , rather than within single observations spanning several hours .",
    "the statistical significance of the correlation on the @xmath2daily timescale is lower , due both to the smaller number of data points and to the fact that flux variance is larger because of the presence of strong variability on shorter timescales . for a chosen x - ray band ,",
    "the best - fit slopes of the relation ( @xmath691 ; listed in figure  [ fig : xray - vhe_fluxflux ] ) are statistically consistent with a single value .",
    "this is in good agreement with our finding that the dominant x - ray flux variability timescale is @xmath6929  hours ( see  [ sec : nustar - variability ] ) .",
    "it could also be indicative of a lag between the bands which is longer than the binning of the data taken strictly simultaneously , however , such an analysis is outside of the scope of this paper .",
    "results of @xcite point to absence of any lags between the x - ray and vhe bands in a nonflaring state of mrk421  in 2009 .",
    "an interesting result stems from our ability to broaden the search for the correlation over a very wide band in x - rays , enabled by the simultaneous and _ nustar _  coverage . as shown in the upper three panels of figure  [ fig : xray - vhe_fluxflux ] , the slope of the relation systematically shifts from @xmath693 for the soft 0.33  kev band , to @xmath694 for the 37  kev band , and to @xmath695 for the hard 730  kev band .",
    "the same behavior is seen in the nightly - averaged data , with somewhat lower significance .",
    "the persistence of this trend on both timescales and in all observatory combinations counters the possibility of a systematic bias related to those choices .",
    "we interpret it as an indication that the soft x - ray band scales more directly with the vhe flux ( which is dominated by _ soft _",
    "@xmath0-ray photons on the low - energy end of the vhe band ) due to the emission being produced by the same population of relativistic electrons .",
    "the greater relative increase in the hard x - ray flux with respect to the soft band is consistent both with the spectral hardening already revealed by our analysis ( see  [ sec : nustar - fluxsep ] ) and the fractional variability distribution determined from our data ( figure  [ fig : fvar ] ) .",
    "our interpretation would imply that the hard x - ray band scales more directly with the higher - energy vhe flux ( e.g. , @xmath696  tev ) , which we can not quantify well with the current data .",
    "we find no significant correlation of the simultaneously observed spectral slopes in the hard x - ray and vhe bands .",
    "remarkably , on two dates when the observed x - ray flux was lowest , january  10 and 20 ( mjd 56302 and 56312 , respectively ) , steep spectra with @xmath1 were observed by _ nustar _  and both vhe observatories .",

    "the blue data points are derived by averaging over 7-day intervals , i.e. ,  integration times used for determination of the flux in the _ fermi_-lat  band . in the top and bottom panels we overplot the slope of one - to - one proportionality ( not a fit ) with a black dotted line .",
    "note that the vertical scale is linear in all panels , but has a different dynamic range in each one . ]      despite the low flux observed in the x - ray and @xmath0-ray bands , the range of the uv / optical flux was higher than in some flaring episodes reported in the past ( e.g.,@xcite ) . in this section we present flux correlation analyses with respect to the uv band , as represented by measurements using @xmath5 .",
    "the choice of band uvw1 ( @xmath700 ) for this work is arbitrary ; results do not change for either of the other two filters , as all of them sample the flux on the opposite side of the extremely variable synchrotron sed peak from the x - ray band . in figure",
    "[ fig : uv_fluxflux ] we show the correlations between the uv and optical , soft x - ray and gev @xmath0-ray bands , each normalized to the lowest flux observed in the 2013 campaign . as in previous sections",
    ", we use the dcf and the associated uncertainty to quantify the correlation significance .",
    "a strong correlation is expected between the uv and optical fluxes , and is confirmed by the data presented here .",
    "previous work hinted at a possible correlation of the optical flux and the x - ray flux , but over a very narrow dynamic range and with low significance @xcite .",
    "the states of mrk421  observed in early 2013 are not consistent with that result , indicating perhaps that a physically different regime was probed .",
    "we examine two different timescales in more detail here : for the uv and x - ray measurements taken within 6  hours of each other the dcf is @xmath701 , while for weekly - averaged values it is @xmath702 , i.e. , consistent with zero in both cases .",
    "note that the x - ray data require averaging in the latter case , and that the uncertainty in flux is dominated by intrinsic variability .",
    "given the established difference in the variability characteristics ( see figure  [ fig : fvar ] ) the lack of a significant correlation , especially on the shorter timescale , is not unexpected .",
    "the most interesting correlation in terms of constraints on physical models is the one between the uv ( and hence the optical , given their essentially 1-to-1 correspondence ) and the _ fermi_-lat  band ( 0.2100  gev ) , shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : uv_fluxflux ] . in the framework of the ssc model , emission in these bands is due to electrons of roughly the same energy .",
    "since the _ fermi_-lat  light curve had to be derived in @xmath4461-week bins due to the low photon counts ( see section  [ sec : data - fermi ] ) , we average the uv flux over the same time periods in order to cross - correlate them .",
    "overall , the dcf is @xmath467 , revealing a possible correlation with a @xmath703@xmath526 significance . in order to examine its robustness against contributions from the outlying data points ,",
    "we perform the following test : we first remove the highest - flux _",
    "fermi_-lat  data point and find that it does not change the dcf , then we remove the lowest - flux data point , which increases the dcf to @xmath704 but lowers the significance .",
    "we therefore estimate the correlation significance to be @xmath4432.5@xmath526 based on the data presented here .",
    "existence of a real correlation between uv and @xmath0-ray bands can not be confirmed with the current data , but this may be possible with the mrk421  observations at higher @xmath0-ray flux , such as those taken during our multiwavelength campaign in april 2013 .     and @xmath705 , i.e. ,  the frequency of the sed peak and the flux at the peak .",
    "the assumption of the log - parabolic model connecting the uv / optical and x - ray data ( purple empty circles ) reveals a proportionality between @xmath706 and @xmath707 ; the dashed black line shows a linear fit best describing that relation . the other method ( using only x - ray data )",
    "does not show a similar relation . in comparison with the observations",
    "published previously , shown here with different hatched grey regions , in 2013 january  march we observed a state in which the peak occurred at atypically low energy and high flux . ]      previous work on modeling the mrk421 sed established that the lower - energy peak of the sed , likely arising from synchrotron processes , is usually located at frequencies between @xmath708 and @xmath709  hz .",
    "the peak itself is therefore often directly observable in the band , as in other similar hbl sources ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "its location in frequency space can be estimated from the uv / optical and x - ray data , using a reasonable smooth interpolation or extrapolation model ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "for the analysis presented here , we use 30 pairs of and _ nustar _",
    "spectra assembled from data taken simultaneously , together with uv data taken within the same observation and r - band data taken within 24  hours . since optical variability is significantly lower , especially on short timescales , the nonsimultaneity of the optical flux measurements is not a serious concern .",
    "we employ the two most commonly used methods from the literature to localize the synchrotron sed peak . in the top panel of figure  [ fig : synchpeak ]",
    "we show examples of both methods applied to two representative sets of data .",
    "the two methods are : i ) fitting a log - parabolic model to the x - ray data alone , using model ` logpar ` described by equation  ( [ eqn : logpar ] ) , and extrapolating to lower energies ; ii ) fitting a log - parabolic model to both optical / uv and x - ray data .",
    "the x - ray - based extrapolation underestimates the uv / optical flux by more than an order of magnitude in nearly all cases .",
    "the peak frequencies predicted by this method uniformly cover the frequency range from @xmath710 to @xmath711  hz and a factor of @xmath712 in peak flux .",
    "interpretation of this simplistic parametrization of the sed would imply that it should consist of two superimposed components in order to match the observed uv / optical flux .",
    "however , log - parabolic fits which additionally include the r - band and uvot fluxes provide a simpler solution that matches the data well on both sides of the sed peak .",
    "this is demonstrated by the two examples shown in figure  [ fig : synchpeak ] .",
    "both methods are somewhat sensitive to the systematic uncertainties in the cross - normalization between the instruments , and to the exact values of the line - of - sight column density and extinction corrections .",
    "we conservatively estimate that the combination of these effects results in a factor of @xmath4432 uncertainty in the synchrotron peak frequency ( @xmath713 ) , which dominates any statistical uncertainty from the fits . for this reason we do not show the uncertainties for individual @xmath713 estimates in figure  [ fig : synchpeak ] .",
    "both methods consistently show the peak at an atypically low frequency ( @xmath714  hz ) , with peak flux comparable to high - activity states ( see lower panel of figure  [ fig : synchpeak ] and references listed there ) . the scatter is found to be larger for the fits using only the x - ray data , which can be easily understood since the curvature is subtle in all but the lowest - energy bins of the band and the parabola has no constraint at energies below the peak .",
    "the optical / uv data provide the leverage to constrain the parabolic curves significantly better .",
    "we find an interesting trend using the second method : the flux at the sed peak is approximately proportional to the square root of the peak frequency .",
    "this is highlighted with a linear fit shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : synchpeak ] .",
    "the best - fit slope of the relation , @xmath715 , is @xmath716 .",
    "the dynamic range over which the relation holds , assuming that this parametrization is valid at all , is unknown .",
    "it is clear from the comparison with the peak localization taken from the literature ( listed in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : synchpeak ] ) that the relation is not universal , although its slope is broadly consistent with the slopes of previously identified relations of the same kind .",
    "given the fact that the simple method used to derive it is purely phenomenological and sensitive to systematic uncertainties , we refrain from quantifying and interpreting this correlation further .",
    "for all observations presented here @xmath717  hz , essentially independent of the choice of model . if only a single peak is assumed to exist , our data unambigously imply that the synchrotron peak frequency was well below the band ( @xmath7180.3  kev ) during this period of very low x - ray activity .",
    "this is atypical for mrk421  based on the previously published data .",
    "we found that , for the states of lowest x - ray activity , our data show a peak frequency as low as @xmath719  hz , estimated with a ( symmetric ) log - parabolic function fitted to both optical / uv and x - ray ( and _ nustar _ ) data .",
    "a peak frequency as low as @xmath720  hz has been reported in @xcite , but only when using a specific model that led to a very asymmetric parameterization of the synchrotron bump . when using a symmetric function ( comparable to a log - parabola ) , the fit to the same observational data reported in @xcite led to a peak frequency of @xmath708  hz , which is typical for mrk421 .",
    "blazars are classified by the frequency of the peak of the synchrotron emission as lbls , ibls and hbls ( for low- , intermediate- and high-@xmath713 bllacs ) if @xmath713 is below @xmath721  hz , in the range @xmath722  hz , or above @xmath723  hz , respectively .",
    "the data presented here show that mrk421 , which is one of the archetypal tev hbls , with a synchrotron peak position well above that of the typical hbl , changed its broadband emission in such a way that it almost became an ibl .",
    "this effect may also happen to other hbls that have not been as extensively observed as mrk421 , and suggests that the sed classification may denote a temporary characteristic of blazars , rather than a permanent one .              for a better understanding of the empirically observed correlations ,",
    "we need to consider the complete broadband spectrum .",
    "sed snapshots for four selected epochs ( marked with dashed vertical lines in figure  [ fig : lc - big ] ) are shown in figure  [ fig : seds ] .",
    "they were selected to show a state of exceptionally low x - ray and vhe flux ( january  10 and  20 ; see  [ sec : results - correlations - xgammaray ] ) , in contrast to higher , though not flaring , states ( january  15 , february  12 , for example ) . in all sed plots",
    "we also show data accumulated over 4.5 months in the 2009 multiwavelength campaign @xcite , which is currently the best - characterized quiescent broadband sed available for mrk421  in the literature .",
    "for the two epochs of very low x - ray flux , we show for the first time states in which both the synchrotron and inverse - compton sed peaks are shifted to _ lower _ energies by almost an order of magnitude compared to the typical quiescent sed .",
    "the accessibility of the low - activity state shows the large scientific potential brought by the improvements in the x - ray and vhe instrumentation in the last several years with the launch of _ nustar _  and upgrades to the and telescopes .",
    "we note that the empirical seds from the 2013 campaign shown here represent @xmath52712 hours of observation in the x - ray and vhe bands , rather than integrations over a time period of weeks or even months .",
    "we match the simultaneous uv , x - ray and vhe data to optical data taken within at most 2  days , radio data taken within at most 2  weeks , and _ fermi _ data integrated over time intervals of 610  days centered on the time of the coordinated x - ray and vhe observations .",
    "mrk421  is a point - like and unresolved source for single - dish radio instruments , which means that the data shown in figure  [ fig : seds ] include emission from spatial scales larger than the jet itself and therefore should be considered as upper limits for the ssc models of jet emission .",

    "the good temporal coverage of the _ nustar _  data reveals a typical variability timescale of @xmath726  hours .",
    "significant variability is clearly detectable even in the low - flux states , which is the case for several epochs in early 2013 .",
    "we find no evidence for strong intrahour variability ; on timescales as short as @xmath210 minutes the variability amplitude is @xmath5275% , approximately an order of magnitude lower than the typical flux change over a 10-hour observation .",
    "this can be inferred from the fact that in the light curves shown in figure  [ fig : nustar_count_rates ] only a small fraction of adjacent bins differ in count rate by more than 3@xmath526 .",
    "we summarize this more formally in figure  [ fig : nustar_var ] .",
    "in contrast to some previous studies ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , we observed no clear time - dependent circular patterns in the count rate  hardness plane .",
    "the reason for this may be that most of the observations seem to have covered periods of decreasing flux , with no well - defined flare - like events except for a few `` mini - flares '' of modest @xmath727% amplitude .",
    "we find that the x - ray spectrum of mrk421  can not generally be described as a simple power law , but that instead it gradually steepens between 0.3 and @xmath270  kev .",
    "for most of the and _ nustar _",
    "observations in the 2013 january  march period , we find that the spectra in both bands are better described when a curvature term is added to the basic power law , as in the log - parabolic model available in @xmath447 . using this model , we find significant curvature at the highest observed fluxes ",
    "still notably lower than in any flaring states  gradually vanishing as flux decreases ( see figure  [ fig : nustar_flux_trends ] ) .",
    "this has a simple explanation because the x - ray band samples the mrk421  sed close to the synchrotron peak : when the x - ray flux is low , and the sed peak shifts to lower energy ( away from the _ nustar _  band ) , the hard x - ray spectra can be well described by a power law .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the steady increase of fractional variability with energy through the x - ray band , as shown in figure  [ fig : fvar ] . the high sensitivity of _ nustar",
    "_  reveals that the hard x - ray spectrum does not exhibit an exponential cutoff , and it is well described by a power law with a photon index @xmath1 , even during the epochs related to the lowest x - ray fluxes .",
    "the _ nustar _  data also show no signature of spectral hardening up to @xmath728  kev , meaning that the onset of the inverse - compton bump must be at even higher energies .",
    "the data gathered in the 2013 multiwavelength campaign contribute some unique details to the rich library of blazar phenomena revealed by mrk421 .",
    "the object is highly variable on a wide range of timescales and fluxes , with the fractional variability amplitude highest at the high - energy ends of the synchrotron and inverse - compton sed bumps ( see figure  [ fig : fvar ] ) .",
    "the well - matched coverage in the x - ray and vhe bands reveals that the steep spectral slope observed in the x - ray band at very low flux occurs simultaneously in time with an atypically steep slope observed in the vhe band .",
    "for the first time we observed a simultaneous shift of both the synchrotron and the inverse - compton sed peaks to lower energies in comparison to the typical quiescent state ( see figure  [ fig : seds ] ) , constrained primarily by the x - ray and vhe data .",
    "the measurements in those bands do not support the existence of high - energy cutoffs up to @xmath729  kev and @xmath730  tev .",
    "all of this indicates that the energies of radiating particles must be very high ( up to @xmath731 ; see  [ sec : discussion - ssc ] below ) even when the source is in such a low state .",
    "in   [ sec : results - correlations - xgammaray ] we have shown that the x - ray and vhe fluxes are correlated at @xmath7323@xmath526 significance . parametrizing the correlation as @xmath733",
    ", the correlation is found to be approximately linear ( @xmath7341 ) both on half - hour and half - day timescales .",
    "this is consistent with most previous results considering similar spectral bands : @xmath735 @xcite , @xmath736 ( @xcite , for averaged and nonflaring periods ; also @xcite ) , @xmath737 ( @xcite ; assumed linear ) etc .",
    "we emphasize the importance of distinguishing between i ) a correlation of count rates versus a correlation of fluxes , since the conversion between them is nonlinear due to spectral variability , and ii ) a general correlation versus a correlation associated with isolated flares , since those could potentially be produced by different physical mechanisms ( as argued by , e.g.,@xcite ) . indeed , for isolated flaring periods @xcite and @xcite find @xmath738 and @xmath739 , respectively .",
    "care should be taken with direct comparison of the results in the literature , since the chosen spectral bands are not always the same , and we have shown in  [ sec : results - correlations - xgammaray ] that the slope does depend on the band choice as a consequence of the spectral variability .",
    "we note that in the simplest , one - zone ssc model , one expects a close correlation between the x - ray and vhe fluxes .",
    "however , if the scattering takes place exclusively in the thomson regime , the inverse - compton flux should obey a quadratic ( @xmath740 ) relationship , since increasing both the number of electrons and the seed photon flux results in a quadratic increase in the scattering rate . since we detect a linear relationship",
    ", this would argue that the scattering cross - section is diminished , possibly because the scattering takes place in the less - efficient klein - nishina regime .",
    "for example , a quadratic relation has recently been observed in a similar hbl object , mrk501 @xcite .",

    "considering the disparity between the variability timescale and the synchrotron cooling timescale , along with the similarity of the increases and decreases in flux during the _ nustar _",
    "observations ( figure  [ fig : nustar_count_rates ] ) , it seems unlikely that the output is dominated by a single shocked region as a site of particle acceleration , such as is often argued to be the case in flaring episodes .",
    "instead , we can interpret the flux changes as a geometrical effect due to a spatially extended region containing multiple particle - acceleration zones contributing comparably to the overall sed .",
    "observation of variability due to geometrical effects of a spatially extended region would lack sharp flux increases in the x - ray band which might result from sudden particle - acceleration events , because the sharp flux increases and decreases from the different regions ( even if partially connected ) would not occur at exactly the same time . in this scenario , the shortest variability timescales , comparable to the electron cooling timescales ,",
    "would be produced only when a single region dominates the overall emission , which is expected to occur during flaring episodes , but not during the relatively low activity reported in this paper .",
    "as described in  [ sec : nustar - variability ] , the observed increases appear at least as smooth and as slow as the observed decreases , in consistency with this picture .",
    "one may argue that the x - ray flux variability reported in  [ sec : nustar - variability ] is not due to acceleration / cooling of electrons , but rather produced by variations in the parameters related to the environment ( e.g. , @xmath747 , @xmath748 ) or the dopper factor @xmath760 ( e.g. , due to a change in the viewing angle ) . in that case , the smooth and relatively slow changes observed in the _ nustar _",
    "light curves would not be related to the short electron cooling timescales derived above , but rather to the variations in the above - mentioned parameters .",
    "however , such a theoretical scenario is strongly disfavored by the fractional variability as a function of energy reported in figure  [ fig : fvar ] , as well as by the lack of correlation between optical and x - ray fluxes reported in figure  [ fig : uv_fluxflux ] , while there is a correlation between optical and gev @xmath0-ray fluxes , as well as x - ray and vhe fluxes , reported in figures  [ fig : uv_fluxflux ] and [ fig : xray - vhe_fluxflux ] , respectively . the only possibility for the parameters @xmath748 , @xmath747 or @xmath760 to dominate the measured flux variations would be to have , at least , two distinct emission regions , one dominating the optical and gev @xmath0-ray bands , and the other dominating the x - ray and vhe bands",
    "therefore , despite the success of the one - zone ssc scenario in describing the broadband sed ( see  [ sec : discussion - ssc ] ) , we argue that the observed multiwavelength variability and correlations point towards an emission region composed of several distinct zones , and dominated by changes in the electron energy distribution .",
    "the increase in the fractional variability with energy for both sed bumps , and the harder - when - brighter trend that is clearly observed in the x - ray spectra measured with _ nustar _",
    "( which is the segment of the broadband sed reconstructed with the highest accuracy ) , indicate that the changes in the electron energy distribution are generally chromatic , with strongest variability in the highest - energy electrons .",
    "however , the saturation of the x - ray spectral shape at the lowest and highest x - ray fluxes ( see  [ sec : nustar - fluxsep ] and figure  [ fig : comp_giebels ] ) suggests that at the times of lowest and highest activity , the variations in the electron energy distribution become achromatic , at least for those electron energies responsible for the x - ray emission .",
    "it is possible that at those times the variability is not dominated by acceleration and cooling of the electrons , but rather by variations in the physical parameters of the environment in which particle acceleration occurs . for the periods of very low activity",
    ", a possibility would be that the radiation is being produced within a larger region by particles accelerated by fermi  ii processes ( e.g. , stochastic acceleration on magnetic turbulence ) , as suggested , for instance , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field implies a size constraint for the acceleration zones , since electrons can not attain energies corresponding to a gyroradius significantly larger than the characteristic size of a zone .",
    "the _ nustar _",
    "data imply no cutoff in the synchrotron sed up to @xmath728kev , so we can estimate the electron gyroradius @xmath838 corresponding to that photon energy using @xmath791 g and the maximal @xmath839 .",
    "since @xmath840 , we have @xmath841  cm , which is much smaller than the inferred emission - region size of @xmath710  cm .",
    "given the large difference of five orders of magnitude between the gyroradius for the highest - energy electrons and the size of the overall emitting region , the electrons can not travel far from their acceleration site without losing a substantial fraction of their energy , and hence the particle acceleration and the emission need to be essentially co - spatial .",
    "we therefore conclude that the set of physical parameters discussed here offers a self - consistent picture in which the observed properties of mrk421  in a nonflaring state are consistent with compact zones of particle acceleration distributed within a significantly larger volume that produces the total emission . while detailed characterization of the acceleration process is outside the scope of the paper , one possible scenario involves magnetic reconnection and `` mini - jets '' formed within a larger emission volume , as suggested , for instance , by @xcite , and developed further by @xcite . for a recent summary of arguments in favor of magnetic reconnection for powering blazar jets ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "regardless of the exact acceleration mechanism , emitting regions composed of multiple zones , e.g , as in the model proposed by @xcite , would be consistent with other behavior observed in blazars , such as the increase in the degree of polarization of the synchrotron radiation when the polarization electric vector rotates , or curvature in the sed arising from non - uniform particle acceleration and energy losses . in a low - activity state , where no single zone dominates the output",
    ", the addition of polarization vectors from individual zones would result in a low overall level of polarization with random fluctuations in both the polarization degree and angle .",
    "our optical polarization measurements , shown in figure  [ fig : optpol ] , are consistent with that prediction .",
    "while multizone scenarios have previously been considered for flaring states ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it has usually been assumed that the quiescent state can be well described by a simpler single - zone ssc model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observations presented here , however , show that , even in this state of very low activity , the emission region may have a more complex structure than previously assumed .",

    "another successful aspect of the campaign is the achieved goal of strictly simultaneous observations in the x - ray and vhe @xmath0-ray bands , in order to constrain the correlated variability . during the data - taking period presented in this work , mrk421  exhibited relatively low activity , including the lowest - flux state ever investigated with high temporal and broadband spectral coverage .",

    ", we find no differences in the variability pattern or timescales between the lower and higher flux states . *",
    "we find a systematic model - independent hardening of the x - ray spectrum with increasing x - ray flux .",
    "as the x - ray activity decreases , the curvature in the x - ray spectrum decreases and the spectral shape becomes softer . at 210",
    "kev fluxes @xmath844  ergs@xmath532@xmath445 , the spectral curvature completely disappears , and the spectral shape saturates into a steep @xmath1 power law , with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up to @xmath729  kev .",
    "* for two epochs of extremely low x - ray and vhe flux , in a regime not previously reported in the literature , we observed atypically steep spectral slopes with @xmath1 in both x - ray and vhe bands . using a simple steady - state one - zone ssc scenario , we find that in these two epochs the peaks of both the synchrotron and inverse - compton components of the sed shifted towards lower frequencies by more than an order of magnitude compared to their positions in the typical low states of mrk421  observed previously .",
    "the peak of the synchrotron bump of mrk421  shifted from @xmath845  kev to @xmath846  kev , which implies that hbls can move towards becoming ibls , leading to the conclusion that the sed classification based on the peak of the synchrotron bump may denote only a temporary rather than permanent characteristic of blazars . * a clear double - bump structure",
    "is found in the fractional variability distribution , computed from radio to vhe @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "this double - bump structure relates to the two peaks in the broadband sed shape of mrk421 , and has been recently reported ( with less resolution ) for both low - activity @xcite and high - activity states @xcite .",

    "we find a tight x - ray  vhe flux correlation in three nonoverlapping x - ray bands between 0.3 and 30  kev , with significantly different scaling .",
    "these results are consistent with an ssc scenario in which the x - ray and vhe radiation are produced by the same relativistic electrons , and the scattering of x - ray photons to vhe energies ( @xmath2tev ) occurs in the less - efficient klein - nishina regime . from broadband",

    "* there is tentative evidence for an optical / uv  gev flux correlation , which is consistent with the emission in these two bands being produced by the same lower - energy electrons within the ssc framework . * no correlation is found between fluxes in the optical / uv and the soft x - ray bands on either short or long timescales . however , we do find that a simple parametrization of the sed around the synchrotron peak with a log - parabolic function leads to a correlation between the peak flux and the frequency at which it occurs over a limited frequency range . *",
    "the reported increase in the fractional variability with energy ( for each of the two sed bumps ) , and the hardening of the x - ray spectra with increasing flux , suggest that the variability in the emission of mrk421  is produced by chromatic changes in the electron energy distribution , with the highest - energy electrons varying the most .",
    "the saturation of the x - ray spectral shape at the extremely high and low x - ray fluxes indicates that , for these periods of outstanding activity , the flux variability is instead dominated by other processes that lead to achromatic variations in the x - ray emission . * the lifetimes of relativistic electrons due to synchrotron losses",

    "<S> we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright , nearby bllac object mrk421 taken in 2013 january - march , involving gasp - webt , _ swift _ , _ nustar _ , _ </S>",
    "<S> fermi_-lat , magic , veritas , and other collaborations and instruments , providing data from radio to very - high - energy  ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray bands . </S>",
    "<S> _ nustar _ yielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 379  kev range , revealing that the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x - ray spectral shape saturates into a steep @xmath1 power law , with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up to @xmath280  kev . </S>",
    "<S> for the first time , we observed both the synchrotron and the inverse - compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) simultaneously shifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows a double - bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed . in each bump , the variability increases with energy which , in the framework of the synchrotron self - compton model , implies that the electrons with higher energies are more variable . </S>",
    "<S> the measured multi - band variability , the significant x - ray - to - vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed in both bands , the lack of correlation between optical / uv and x - ray flux , the low degree of polarization and its significant ( random ) variations , the short estimated electron cooling time , and the significantly longer variability timescale observed in the _ nustar _ light curves point toward in - situ electron acceleration , and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributing to the broadband emission of mrk421 during low - activity states . </S>"
