    "the effective field theory ( eft ) of point - like interactions is a model - independent approach to systems without infinite - range forces in atomic , molecular and nuclear physics at very - low energies with shallow real or virtual 2-body bound - states ( `` dimers '' ) , see e.g.  @xcite for reviews .",
    "when the size or scattering length @xmath0 of a 2-body system is much larger than the size ( or interaction range ) @xmath1 of the constituents , a small , dimension - less parameter @xmath2 allows to classify the typical size of neglected corrections at @xmath3th order beyond leading order ( n@xmath4lo ) as about @xmath5 .",
    "for example , @xmath6    and @xmath7    in the @xmath8 molecule , i.e.  @xmath9 , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the deuteron , i.e.  @xmath12 in the `` pion - less '' eft , eft(@xmath13 ) , where pion - exchange between nucleons is not resolved as non - local .",
    "thus , the detailed dynamics on the `` high - energy '' scale @xmath1 can vary largely : for example , attractive van - der - waals forces @xmath14 balance in @xmath8 a repulsive core generated by qed ; but in nuclear physics , one - pion exchange @xmath15}}$ ] is balanced by a short - range repulsion whose origin in qcd is not yet understood .",
    "it is a pivotal advantage of an eft that it allows predictions of pre - determined accuracy without such detailed understanding  as long as one is interested in low - energy processes , i.e.  physics at the scale @xmath0 , and not @xmath1 .",
    "even when possible ( as in qed  at least at scales @xmath16 ) , efts reduce numerically often highly involved computations of short - distance contributions to low - energy observables by encoding them into a few simple , model - independent constants of contact interactions between the constituents .",
    "these in turn can be determined by simpler simulations of the underlying theory , or  when they are as in qcd not ( yet ) tenable  by fit to data .",
    "universal aspects of few - body systems with shallow bound - states are manifest in efts , with deviations systematically calculable . in 2-body scattering for example ,",
    "the eft of point - like interactions reproduces the effective - range expansion , but goes beyond it in the systematic , gauge - invariant inclusion of external currents , relativistic effects , etc .",
    "take 3-body forces ( 3bfs ) : they parameterise interactions on scales much smaller than what can be resolved by 2-body interactions , i.e.  in which 3 particles sit on top of each other in a volume smaller than @xmath17 .",
    "traditionally , they were often introduced _ a posteriori _ to cure discrepancies between experiment and theory , but such an approach is of course untenable when data are scarce or 1- and 2-body properties should be extracted from 3-body data . but how important are 3bfs in observables ?",
    "the classification in efts rests on the tenet that a 3bf is included if and only if necessary to cancel cut - off dependences in low - energy observables .",
    "i outline this philosophy and its results in the following , finding that  independent of the underlying mechanism ",
    "3bfs behave very much alike in such disparate systems as molecular trimers and 3-nucleon systems , but do not follow simplistic expectations .",
    "in the faddeev equation of particle - dimer scattering without 3bfs , fig .  [",
    "fig : kinematics ] , the @xmath18-wave 2-body scattering amplitude is given by the lo - term of the effective - range expansion .",
    "this dimer and the remaining particle `` interact '' via @xmath19 , the one - particle propagator projected onto relative angular momentum @xmath20 .",
    "thick line ( @xmath21 ) : 2-body propagator ; thin line ( @xmath19 ) : propagator of the exchanged particle ; ellipse : lo half off - shell amplitude @xmath22 . ]",
    "[ fig : higherorders ]    even for small relative on - shell momenta @xmath23 between dimer and particle , we need the scattering amplitude @xmath22 for _ all _ off - shell momenta @xmath24 to determine its value at the on - shell point @xmath25 , and hence in particular for @xmath24 beyond the scale @xmath26 on which a description in terms of point - like constituents is tenable .",
    "it is therefore natural to demand that all low - energy observables on a scale @xmath27 are insensitive to derails of the amplitude at @xmath28 , namely to form and value of the regulator , form - factor or cut - off chosen .",
    "if not , a 3bf must soak up the dependence . in an eft , this is the fundamental tenet : include a 3bf _ if and only if _ it is needed as counter - term to cancel divergences which can not be absorbed by renormalising 2-body interactions .",
    "thus , only combinations of 2- and 3bfs are physically meaningful . with",
    "the cut - off variation of the 3bf thus fixed , the initial condition leads to one free parameter fixed from a 3-body datum or knowledge of the underlying physics .",
    "3bfs are thus not added out of phenomenological needs but to guarantee that observables are insensitive to off - shell effects .",
    "a mellin transformation @xmath29 solves the equation for @xmath30 .",
    "the spin - content is then encoded only in the homogeneous term : @xmath31 for 3 nucleons with total spin @xmath32 , or for the totally spin and iso - spin anti - symmetric part of the spin-@xmath33-channel ; @xmath34 for 3 identical spin - less bosons and the totally spin and iso - spin symmetric part of the spin-@xmath33-channel .",

    "the asymptotics depends thus only but crucially on @xmath38 and @xmath20 .",
    "relevant in the uv - limit are the solutions for which @xmath39 $ ] is minimal .    at first glance , we would expect the asymptotics to be given by the asymptotics of the inhomogeneous ( driving ) term : @xmath40 , i.e.  @xmath41 .",
    "however , we must sum an infinite number of graphs already at leading order . as fig .",
    "[ fig : s - lambdafixed ] shows , this modifies the asymptotics considerably .     at @xmath34 ( left ) and @xmath31 .",

    "limit cycle and efimov effect occur only when the solid line lies below the dashed one , and @xmath42\\not=0$].,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    how sensitive are higher - order corrections to the uv - behaviour of @xmath22 ?",
    "the 2-body scattering - amplitude is systematically improved by including the effective range , higher partial waves etc .",
    "corrections to 3-body observables ( including partial - wave mixing ) are found by perturbing around the lo solution as in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinematics ] .",
    "most sensitive to unphysically high momenta is each correction at n@xmath4lo which is proportional to the @xmath3th power of loop momenta .",
    "the question when it becomes cut - off sensitive is now rephrased as : when does the correction diverge as the cut - off is removed , i.e.  when is its _ superficial degree of divergence _ non - negative ?",
    "the answer by simply counting loop momenta in the diagram : @xmath43\\geq0\\;\\;.\\ ] ] we therefore find at which order the first 3bf is needed just by determining when a correction to the 3-body amplitude with only 2-body interactions becomes dependent on unphysical short - distance behaviour .",
    "it is instructive to re - visit these findings in position space .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the wave - function in the hyper - radial dimer - particle distance @xmath44 , @xmath45 f(r)=0\\;\\;,\\ ] ] looks like the one for a free particle with centrifugal barrier .",
    "one would thus expect @xmath46 ( hyper - spherical co - ordinates ! ) .",
    "it had however already been recognised by minlos and faddeev that the centrifugal term is for three bosons ( @xmath34 ) despite expectations attractive , so that the wave - function collapses to the origin and seems infinitely sensitive to very - short - distance physics . in order to stabilise the system against collapse",
    " or , equivalently , remove dependence on details of the cut - off ",
    ", a 3bf must be added  or , equivalently , a self - adjoint extension be specified at the origin i.e.  a boundary condition for the wave - function must be fixed by a 3-body datum .",
    "on the other hand , 3bfs are demoted if @xmath47 : the centrifugal barrier provides _ more _ repulsion than expected , and hence the wave - function is pushed further out , i.e.  _ less _ sensitive to details at distances @xmath48 where the constituents are resolved as extended .",
    "birse confirmed this recently by a renormalisation - group analysis in position - space  @xcite .",
    "about half of the 3bfs for @xmath49 are _ weaker _ , half _ stronger _ than one would expect simplistically , see table  [ tab : ordering ] .",
    "the higher partial - waves follow expectation , as the faddeev equation is then saturated by the born approximation .",
    ".order of the leading 3bf , indicating if actual values ( [ eq : twobodydivs]/[eq : s ] ) are stronger ( `` prom . '' ) or weaker ( `` dem . '' ) than the simplistic estimate .",
    "last column : typical size of 3bf in eft(@xmath13 ) ; in parentheses size from the simplistic estimate . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath18-wave 3bf of spin - less bosons is stronger , while the @xmath50-wave 3bf is weaker .    that the first @xmath18-wave 3bf appears already at lo leads to a new renormalisation - group phenomenon , the `` limit - cycle '' .",
    "it explains the efimov and thomas effects , and universal correlations e.g.  between particle - dimer scattering length and trimer binding energy ( the phillips line ) . in general , it appears whenever the kernel of the integral equation not compact , i.e.  @xmath42\\not=0 $ ] and @xmath51|<{\\mathrm{re}}[l+1]$ ] .",
    "we finally note that the power - counting requires a new , independent 3bf with @xmath52 derivatives to enter at n@xmath53lo and provides high - accuracy phase - shifts in atom - dimer and nucleon - deuteron scattering , and loss rates close to feshbach resonances in bose - einstein condensates , see e.g.  @xcite for details .",
    "demotion might seem an academic dis - advantage  to include some higher - order corrections which are not accompanied by new divergences does not improve the accuracy of the calculation ; one only appears to have worked harder than necessary .",
    "however , demotion is pivotal when one wants to predict the experimental precision necessary to dis - entangle 3bfs in observables , and here the error - estimate of efts is crucial . in @xmath54-atom - dimer scattering ,",
    "where @xmath9 , only high - precision experiments can however reveal contributions from 3bfs beyond the one found in the @xmath18-wave .    on the other hand , @xmath12 in eft(@xmath13)of nuclear physics .",
    "now , the demotion or promotion of 3bfs makes all the difference whether an experiment to determine 3bf effects is feasible at all .",
    "for example , the quartet-@xmath18 wave scattering - length in the neutron - deuteron system sets at present the experimental uncertainty in an indirect determination of the doublet scattering length , which in turn is well - known to be sensitive to 3bfs .",
    "its value in eft(@xmath13)at n@xmath55lo , @xmath56\\;{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{fm}}}=     [ 6.35\\pm0.02]\\;{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{fm}}}\\;\\;,\\ ] ] converges nicely and agrees very well with experiment , @xmath57\\;{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{fm}}}$ ] .",
    "the theoretical accuracy by neglecting higher - order terms is here estimated conservatively by @xmath12 of the difference between the nlo- and n@xmath55lo - result .",
    "table  [ tab : ordering ] predicts that the first 3bf enters not earlier than n@xmath58lo .",
    "indeed , if the theoretical uncertainty continues to decreases steadily as from nlo to n@xmath55lo , an accuracy of @xmath59 with only 2-nucleon scattering data as input can be reached in calculations .",
    "this is comparable to the range over which modern high - precision potential - model calculations differ : @xmath60\\;{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{fm}}}$ ] .",
    "if the 3bf would occur at n@xmath61lo as simplistically expected , the error by 3bfs would be @xmath62 , considerably larger than the spread in the potential - model predictions .",
    "differential cross - sections and partial - waves are also in excellent agreement with much more elaborate state - of - the - art potential model calculations at energies up to @xmath63 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the cross - section of triton radiative capture @xmath64 at thermal energies provides another example  @xcite .",
    "nuclear models give a spread of @xmath65\\;\\mathrm{mb}$ ] , depending on the 2-nucleon potential , and how the @xmath66 as first nucleonic excitation is included . on the other hand , a process at @xmath67 ev [ _ sic _ ] incident neutron energy and less than @xmath68 photon energy should be insensitive to details of the deuteron wave - function and of a resonance with an excitation energy of @xmath69 .",
    "indeed , the power - counting of 3bfs applies equally with external currents , only that the higher - order interaction in fig .",
    "[ fig : higherorders ] includes now also the momentum- or energy - transfer from the external source as additional low - energy scales .",
    "as no new 3bfs are needed up to n@xmath55lo to render cut - off independent results , the result is completely determined by simple 2-body observables as @xmath70\\;\\mathrm{mb}=     [ 0.503\\pm0.003]\\;\\mathrm{mb}\\;\\;,\\ ] ] which converges and compares well with the measured value , @xmath71\\;\\mathrm{mb}$ ] .",
    "the cross - section relevant for big - bang nucleo - synthesis ( @xmath72 ) is also in excellent agreement with data  @xcite .",
    "with these findings , the eft of 3-body systems with only contact interactions is a self - consistent , systematic field theory which contains the minimal number of interactions at each order to render the theory renormalisable .",
    "each 3-body counter - term gives rise to one subtraction - constant which is fixed by a 3-body datum .",
    "table  [ tab : ordering ] sorts the 3bfs by their strengthes , their symmetries and the channels in which they contribute at the necessary level of accuracy . amongst the host of applications in nuclear physics",
    "are triton and @xmath73he properties , reactions in big - bang nucleo - synthesis , neutrino astro - physics , the famed nuclear @xmath74-problem , and the experimental determination of fundamental neutron properties .",
    "the method presented here is applicable to any eft in which an infinite number of diagram needs to be summed at lo , e.g.  because of shallow bound - states .",
    "one example is chiral eft , the eft of pion - nucleon interactions .",
    "only those local @xmath75-body forces are added at each order which are necessary as counter - terms to cancel divergences at short distances .",
    "this mandates a careful look at the ultraviolet - behaviour of the leading - order , non - perturbative scattering amplitude .",
    "it leads at each order and to the prescribed level of accuracy to a cut - off independent theory with the smallest number of experimental input - parameters .",
    "the power - counting is thus not constructed by educated guesswork but by rigorous investigations of the renormalisation - group properties of couplings and observables using the methodology of eft .",
