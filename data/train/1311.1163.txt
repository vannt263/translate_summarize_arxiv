    "nowadays we must process a massive amount of data in our daily life and the scientific research .",
    "data analysis methods have played an important role in processing and analyzing these data .",
    "most data analysis methods use pre - determined basis , including the most commonly used fourier transform and wavelet transform . while these data analysis methods are very efficient in processing data , each component of the decomposition in general",
    "does not reveal the intrinsic physical information of these data due to the presence of harmonics in the decomposition .",
    "for example , application of these traditional data analysis methods to a modulated oscillatory chirp signal would produce many components .",
    "thus , it is essential to develop a truly adaptive data analysis method that can extract hidden physical information such as trend and time varying cycles from these data and preserve the integrity of the physically meaningful components . to achieve this",
    ", we need to use a data - driven basis that is adapted to the signal instead of being determined _ a priori_.    the emd method @xcite provides an efficient adaptive method to analyze nonlinear and nonstationary data .",
    "the emd method is empirical in nature .",
    "several methods with more clear mathematical structures have been proposed as a variant of the emd method , see e.g. synchrosqueezed wavelet transform @xcite , empirical wavelet transform @xcite , variational mode decomposition @xcite .",
    "inspired by the emd method and the recently developed compressed ( compressive ) sensing theory , we proposed a data - driven time - frequency analysis method @xcite . in this method , we formulate the problem as a nonlinear optimization problem and decompose the signal by looking for the sparsest representation of a multiscale signal over a largest possible dictionary .    in our data - driven time - frequency analysis",
    ", we decompose a given signal @xmath0 into the following form : @xmath1 where @xmath2 are smooth functions , @xmath3 and @xmath4 is an integer that is given _ a priori_. we assume that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are less oscillatory than @xmath7 .",
    "we call @xmath8 as the intrinsic mode functions ( imfs ) and @xmath9 the instantaneous frequencies @xcite",
    ". the objective of our data - driven time - frequency analysis is to extract the intrinsic mode functions and their instantaneous frequencies .    in @xcite",
    ", we proposed to decompose the signal by solving the following optimization problem : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the dictionary consist of all imfs ( see @xcite for its precise definition ) .",
    "further , an efficient algorithm based on matching pursuit and fast fourier transform has been proposed to solve the above nonlinear optimization problem . in a subsequent paper @xcite",
    ", we proved the convergence of our algorithm for periodic data that satisfy certain scale separation property .",
    "basis pursuit is another powerful method to obtain the sparsest representation of a signal .",
    "unforturnately , the basis pursuit can not apply directly to , since the dictionary @xmath11 has infinitely many atoms .",
    "but if the number of imfs , @xmath4 , is known , the idea of basis pursuit can be generalized to approximate the optimization problem . in this case",
    ", we can obtain the desirable decomposition by solving the following dictionary learning problem : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , \\label{fourier - theta - intro}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath14 is the basis to decompose the signal @xmath15",
    ". the specific form of the basis as a function of @xmath16 will be given in ( [ basis - cos ] ) .    in , the basis @xmath17 is not known _ a priori_. it is determined by the phase functions @xmath18 and the phase functions are adaptive to the data .",
    "we need to solve not only the optimal coefficients @xmath19 but also the optimal basis @xmath17 . in this sense ,",
    "the problem described above can be seen as a dictionary learning problem .",
    "dictionary learning is a well - established subject in signal processing .",
    "many efficient methods have been developed for this purpose @xcite .",
    "but the problem we study here has some important differences from a traditional dictionary learning problem . in a traditional dictionary learning problem ,",
    "a common setup starts with a training set , a collection of training vectors .",
    "the atoms of the dictionary can be any function .",
    "for the problem we consider , we only have one signal not a training set .",
    "moreover , the atoms of the dictionary in our problem can not be any function .",
    "if we do not put any constraint on the atoms of the dictionary , we may get only trivial decompositions . in order to get a reasonable result ,",
    "the atoms of the dictionary are restricted to be nonlinear functionals of the phase function @xmath16 . at the same time , the phase functions are confined to be a low dimensional space to make sure that the overall degree of freedoms is not too large . then we can still get a reasonable decomposition with only one mesurement of the signal .",
    "we need to develop a new method to solve this non - convex optimization problem , which is not required by a traditional dictionary learning problem .",
    "the key part is to find the phase functions .",
    "once the phase functions are known , we only need to solve a @xmath20 optimization problem to get the decomposition . based on this observation",
    ", we develop an iterative algorithm to solve .",
    "this algorithm starts from one initial guess of phase functions . in each step , the phase functions are fixed and one @xmath20 optimization problem is solved .",
    "the phase functions will updated in the next iteration .",
    "this precedure is repeated until the iteration converges . in each step , the augmented lagrangian multiplier method ( alm ) is used to solve the linear @xmath20 optimization problem .",
    "we further accelerate the alm method in each iteration by using the fast wavelet transform .",
    "this method can be also generalized to decompose signals that contain outliers by enlarging the dictionary to include impulses .",
    "we will demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to decompose several multiscale data , include sythetic data and real data .",
    "for the data that we consider in this paper , we will demonstrate that we can recover both the instantaneous frequencies and the intrinsic mode functions very accurately .",
    "even for those signals that are polluted by noise , we still can approximate the instantaneous frequencies and the imfs with reasonable accuracy comparable to the noise level .",
    "the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give the formulation of our problem . in section 3 ,",
    "an iterative algorithm is introduced to solve the nonlinear optimization problem .",
    "an accelerated procedure is introduced based on the fast wavelet transform in section 4 . in section 5 , we generalize this method to deal with signals that have outliers . in section 6 ,",
    "several numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are made in section 7 .",
    "in this section , we will set up the framework of the sparse time - frequency decomposition .",
    "let @xmath21 be a multi - resolution approximation of @xmath22 and @xmath23 the associated scaling function , @xmath24 the corresponding wavelet function .",
    "assume that @xmath23 is real and @xmath25 has compact support , @xmath26 , where @xmath25 is the fourier transform of @xmath23 defined below , @xmath27    for each @xmath28 , we assume that @xmath29 . since @xmath16 is a strictly monotonously increasing function , we can use @xmath16 as a coordinate .",
    "then we can define the following wavelet basis in the @xmath16-coordinate , @xmath30 , \\label{wavelet - envelope - j}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is a positive integer associated with the lowest frequency of the envelope . in practice , @xmath31 is usually determined by the time span of the signal . and @xmath32 in this paper , we use the meyer wavelet to construct the basis .",
    "we assume that the envelope is sufficiently smooth , @xmath33 .",
    "thus , @xmath34 has a sparse representation over the wavelet basis @xmath35 , and the corresponding imf , defined as @xmath36 , has a sparse representation over the following basis : @xmath37\\quad\\label{basis - cos } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this in turn implies that the signal @xmath0 given in ( [ decomp - f ] ) would have a sparse representation over the combination of all @xmath14 : @xmath13 .\\label{fourier - theta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] based on this observation , we propose to decompose the signal @xmath0 in ( [ decomp - f ] ) by looking for the sparsest representation over @xmath17 : @xmath38 where @xmath39^t$ ] and @xmath40 are the corresponding coefficients of @xmath36 when we project @xmath36 over the basis @xmath41 .",
    "thanks to the development of the compressive sensing , we know that the minimization using the @xmath42 norm can be relaxed to the convex minimization using the @xmath20 norm in many cases",
    ". we also apply this relaxation to simplify the optimization problem .",
    "this gives rise to the following nonlinear @xmath20 optimization problem : @xmath43 this nonlinear optimization problem is actually a dictionary learning problem . in this problem , not only the coefficients are unknown , but the basis over which the signal has a sparse representation is also unknown _ a priori_. the basis is determined by the phase functions @xmath44 .",
    "both the coefficients @xmath19 and the phase functions need to be determined in the optimization process .    in this paper , we construct the basis by utilizing the wavelet basis instead of the overcomplete fourier basis which was used in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "we choose the wavelet basis over the overcomplete fourier basis because there are fast decomposition and reconstruction algorithms using the wavelet basis .",
    "this feature makes our algorithm very efficient . for periodic signals",
    ", we can use the standard fourier basis , which can be made very efficient by using the fast fourier transform .",
    "but the fourier basis works only for periodic signals . for general nonperiodic signals , the wavelet basis seems to be more robust although it still suffers from the `` end effect '' near the boundary of the signal .",
    "inspired by the algorithm in @xcite , we propose the following iterative algorithm to solve the nonlinear @xmath20 optimization problem ( [ opt - l1 ] ) .    initial guess of phase functions @xmath45 , @xmath46 , where @xmath31 is same as that in ( [ wavelet - envelope - j ] ) . phase functions and corresponding envelopes : @xmath47 .",

    "this algorithm is essentially based on the gauss - newton iteration which is derived by performing a local linearization around the phase functions in the current step .",
    "both the matrix @xmath62 in ( [ opt - mul - linear ] ) and @xmath63 in ( [ eq : envs ] ) come from this linearization procedure .",
    "the coefficients , @xmath63 , are just auxiliary functions in the iteration , and will tend to zero as the iteration converges",
    ".    in some sense , the above algorithm shares some common idea with that of the k - svd algorithm @xcite .",
    "the step to solve the @xmath20 optimization problem is similar to the sparse coding stage in the k - svd method and the step to update the phase functions is similar to the codebook update stage .",
    "the main difference is in the codebook update stage . in our problem , the atoms of the dictionary are not arbitrary function .",
    "it is parameterized by the phase functions .",
    "for this reason , we can not use svd to update the dictionary directly .",
    "instead , we use the gauss - newton algorithm to update the phase functions , which in turn updates the dictionary accordingly .    in the step to update the phase functions , we choose to update the instantaneous frequency ( derivative of the phase function ) instead of updating the phase function directly .",
    "this is because @xmath64 could be discontinuous if we do not add or subtract @xmath65 at some particular points .",
    "the choice of @xmath66 is to make sure that the new instantaneous frequency is positive .",
    "the projection operator @xmath67 is used to abate the dependence on the initial guess .",
    "the value of @xmath68 is gradually increased to improve the accuracy of our approximation to the phase function so that it converges to the correct value .",
    "when @xmath68 is small , @xmath69 is confined to a small space . in this small space ,",
    "the objective functional has fewer extrema .",
    "the iteration may find an good approximation for @xmath69 . by gradually increasing @xmath68 , we enlarge the space for @xmath69 which allows for the small scale structures of @xmath69 to develop gradually during the iterations .    in the numerical examples presented in section [ sec : numerics ] ,",
    "we obtain the initial guess using a simple approach based on the fourier transform .",
    "more precisely , we obtain the initial guess by estimating the wavenumber by which the high frequency components are centered around .    in the above algorithm ,",
    "the most expensive part of the algorithm is to solve the @xmath20 optimization problem ( [ opt - mul - linear ] ) . in this paper",
    ", we use an augmented lagrange multiplier ( alm ) algorithm @xcite to solve ( [ opt - mul - linear ] ) . in order to simplify the notations ,",

    "note that the matrix @xmath76 $ ] is the combination of @xmath4 matrices with smaller size .",
    "it is natural to use the following sweeping algorithm to solve @xmath75 iteratively :    @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "compute @xmath79 .",
    "compute @xmath80 .",
    "theoretically , we need to run the above sweeping process several times until the solution converges , but in practical computations , in order to save the computational cost , we only run the sweeping process once .",
    "combining this idea with the augmented lagrange multiplier method , we obtain the following algorithm to solve the @xmath20 optimization problem ( [ opt - mul - linear ] ) :    @xmath77 , @xmath81 , @xmath78 compute @xmath82 .",
    "compute @xmath83 . @xmath84 .",
    "in this section , we propose an approximate solver to accelerate the computation of @xmath83 which is the most expensive step in algorithm 1 .    in this paper , we only consider the signal which is well resolved by the samples and the samples are uniformly distributed in time and the total number of the samples is @xmath85 . based on these assumptions , we can approximate the continuous integral by the discrete summation and the integration error is negligible .",
    "this greatly simplifies our calculations .",
    "now , we turn to simplify the optimization problem .",
    "first , we replace the standard @xmath86 norm by a weighted @xmath86 norm which gives the following approximation : @xmath87 where @xmath88 .    using the fact that @xmath89 , it is easy to check that the columns of the matrix @xmath90 are orthonormal under the weighted discrete inner product @xmath91 where @xmath92,\\ ; { \\mathbf}{h}=\\left[h_i\\right],\\ ; \\theta'{\\mathbf}{h}=\\left[\\theta'(t_i)h_i\\right],\\ ; i=1,\\cdots , n$ ] .    using this property , it is easy to derive the following equality : @xmath93 we can also define the projection operator @xmath94 to @xmath95 space . here",
    "@xmath95 is the linear space spanned by the columns of the matrix @xmath90 and @xmath94 is the projection operator to @xmath95 .",
    "since the columns of the matrix @xmath90 are orthonormal under the weighted inner product ( [ weighted - inner - product ] ) , projection @xmath94 can be calculated as follows : @xmath96.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , we are ready to show that the optimization problem ( [ weight - l1 ] ) can be solved explicitly by the shrinkage operator . to simplify the notation ,",
    "we denote @xmath97 , @xmath98\\right ] \\|_{2,\\theta_j}^2\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\operatorname*{argmin}_{{\\mathbf}{p}_j } \\|{\\mathbf}{p}_j\\|_1+\\frac{\\mu}{2}\\|{\\mathbf}{p}_j-\\theta_{\\theta_j}^{t}\\cdot \\left[\\theta_j'w\\right]\\|_{2}^2\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\mathcal{s}_{\\mu^{-1}}\\left(\\theta_{\\theta_j}^{t}\\cdot \\left[\\theta_j'\\left({\\mathbf}{r}_j^k+{\\mathbf}{q}^k/\\mu\\right)\\right]\\right ) , \\label{der - wavelet}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the shrinkage operator defined below : @xmath100    notice that the matrix vector product in ( [ der - wavelet ] ) has the following structure by the definition of @xmath101 in ( [ def - theta ] ) @xmath102^t.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is nothing but the wavelet transform of @xmath103 and @xmath104 in the @xmath16-coordinate , since the columns of @xmath35 are standard wavelet basis in the @xmath16-coordinate .",
    "then this product can be computed efficiently by interpolating @xmath105 and @xmath106 to the uniform grid in the @xmath16 coordinate and employing the fast wavelet transform .    summarizing the above discussion , we obtain algorithm [ alg : sweep - alm - wavelet ] based on the fast wavelet transform to solve the optimization problem ( [ opt - mul - linear ] ) :    @xmath107 .",

    "similarly , the computation in step 5 can be accelerated by a fast wavelet reconstruction algorithm , since each column of the matrix @xmath35 is standard wavelet basis in the @xmath16-space .",
    "one advantage of the formulation ( [ opt - l1 ] ) is that it can be generalized to deal with more complicated data with some minor modifications . in this section",

    "now we are trying to apply our method to analyze the signals from real bridges .",
    "in this paper , we introduced a noval formulation to obtain sparse time - frequency decomposition and the corresponding instantaneous frequencies .",
    "we formulated the decomposition as a dictionary learning problem .",
    "the dictionary is parametrized by phase functions and the phase functions are determined by the signal itself . based on our previous work and the methods of dictionary learning",
    ", we developed an iterative algorithm to look for the phase functions and the corresponding decomposition . by designing the dictionary carefully to make them orthogonal in the coordinate of the phase functions",
    ", we can accelerate the algorithm by using the fast wavelet transform .",
    "this makes our algorithm very efficient .",
    "another advantage of this method is that it can be easily generalized to deal with more complicated data that are not sparse over the time - frequency dictionary , such as data with outliers . for this kind of signals",
    ", we just need to enlarge the dictionary and follow the similar procedure to look for the sparsest decomposition over this enlarged dictionary .",
    "we presented several numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method , including data that do not have scale separation and data that are polluted by noise or outliers .",
    "the results that we obtained seem to suggest that our method can offer an effective way to decompose multiscale data even with poor scale separation property .",
    "we remark that decomposing several imfs simultaneously increases the complexity of the optimization problem . as a result ,",
    "the robustness of this new method is not as good as the previous one that we introduced in @xcite .",
    "moreover , to apply this method , we need to know some information of the signal .",
    "we are considering to combine with other time - frequency analysis method , such as synchrosqueezed wavelet transform @xcite in our future work .",
    "another interesting problem that we are considering is to decompose data with intra - wave frequency modulation .",
    "this type of data is known to be very challenging .",
    "naive application of traditional data analysis methods tends to introduce artificial harmonics . to deal with this kind of data",
    ", we have to extend the definition of the dictionary by replacing the cosine function by an unknwon periodic shape function that we need to find as part of the optimization problem .",
    "this work will be reported in our future paper .",
    "the other project we are working on is to apply the method in this paper to analyze the signals from real bridges and we have got some progress .",
