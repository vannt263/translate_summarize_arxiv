    "broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars show deep and wide blueshifted absorption troughs in their rest - frame uv spectra ( e.g. , weymann et al .",
    "the intrinsic fraction of quasars with bals is @xmath5 20% ( e.g. , hewett & foltz  2003 ) ; in the most commonly accepted scenario this represents the covering factor of an outflowing bal wind .",
    "while all bal quasars show absorption from high - ionization transitions , such as si iv and c iv , some also display absorption from lower ionization transitions , such as mg ii , and such objects tend to be more reddened ( e.g. , sprayberry & foltz  1992 ; reichard et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "although bals were once believed to be confined to radio - quiet sources , optical spectroscopy of the quasars from the _ vla _ 1.4 ghz first survey @xcite , conducted by the first bright quasar survey ( white et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) has revealed many radio - loud bal quasars ( e.g. , becker et al .",
    "2000 ; menou et al .",
    "radio - loudness is commonly parameterized by the ratio of rest - frame radio - to - optical flux densities , @xmath7 @xcite , where those quasars with @xmath8  1 are considered radio - loud . as this definition",
    "may somewhat exaggerate the radio - loudness of bal quasars with substantial optical reddening , it is also useful to consider the rest - frame radio luminosity density , where @xmath9  10@xmath10 erg  s@xmath11  hz@xmath12 distinguishes radio - loud quasars ( e.g. , miller et al .  1993 ) .",
    "the majority of radio - loud bal quasars discovered to date meet both criteria but tend to be of intermediate radio - loudness ( fewer than 20% in the combined samples of becker et al .",
    "2000 and menou et al .",
    "2001 have @xmath8  2 ) .",
    "@xcite found that about one - third of their bal quasars were flat - spectrum radio sources ( some radio loud ) , suggesting a viewing angle for this subset well above the equatorial region where disk - associated bal outflows would be visible , and further discovered that most of their bal quasars were compact ( 80% unresolved to 0.2@xmath6 at 8  ghz ) .",
    "these results support alternate proposals that bals may be associated with an evolutionary phase with a large bal wind covering fraction , rather than orientation ( e.g. , gregg et al .",
    "2000 ) , although the consistency of the sub - millimeter emission of bal quasars with that of non - bal quasars is difficult to reconcile with evolutionary scenarios in which bal quasars are emerging from a dusty `` shroud '' ( lewis et al .",
    "2003 ; willott et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "radio - quiet bal quasars , particularly those with low - ionization absorption features , are usually weaker in x - rays than would be expected from their optical luminosities ( e.g. , green et al .  2001 ; gallagher et al .",
    "the x - ray spectra of radio - quiet bal quasars show clear evidence of x - ray absorption , often complex , with intrinsic column densities ( e.g. , gallagher et al .",
    "although uv and x - ray absorption are clearly linked ( e.g. , brandt , laor , & wills 2000 ) , the higher column density of the x - ray absorber ( e.g. , gallagher et al .",
    "2006 ) suggests the x - ray absorption arises interior to the uv bals , perhaps in the `` shielding gas '' postulated by murray et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and generated naturally in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "a _ chandra _ snapshot survey of five radio - loud bal quasars confirmed they are also x - ray weak relative to similar non - bal quasars , but with fairly soft spectra incompatible with the large column densities necessary to explain this weakness as simple neutral absorption ( brotherton et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "many radio - loud quasars display striking extended emission in the form of jets and lobes .",
    "the classification scheme of fanaroff & riley ( 1974 ) distinguishes the edge - darkened , core - dominated fr  i sources from the more luminous edge - brightened , lobe - dominated fr  ii objects .",
    "the multiwavelength properties of fr  i and fr  ii jets are quite distinct : fr  i jets have linear or convex spectral energy distributions ( seds ) that can typically be modeled by a synchrotron spectrum extrapolated ( with a break if necessary ) from the radio through the optical to the x - ray ( e.g. , worrall et al .",
    "2004 ) , while the seds of the prominent knots in fr  ii jets are concave , frequently possessing only an upper limit at optical wavelengths ( e.g. , sambruna et al .",
    "2004 ; marshall et al .",
    "2005 ) . the x - ray emission in fr  ii jets is often interpreted as arising from inverse - compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons ( ic / cmb models ; e.g. , tavecchio et al .",
    "2000 ; celotti et al .  2001 ) , a process that is increasingly efficient for highly relativistic bulk motions , for jet angles close to the line of sight , and for objects at large redshifts ( schwartz 2002 ) .",
    "some observational and theoretical complications with ic / cmb models have been noted ( e.g. , tavecchio et al .",
    "2003 ; hardcastle 2006 ) , and high - redshift radio - loud quasars in general do not appear to have extreme jet - to - core x - ray brightness ratios ( e.g. , siemiginowska et al .",

    "2004 ; lopez et al .",

    "chandra _ in a number of fr  ii sources ; the most luminous hotspots are consistent with synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission but other cases require a second highly energetic synchrotron component to produce the x - ray emission ( hardcastle et al .",

    "these results suggest that the x - ray weakness of pg  1004 + 130 is likely related to absorption .",
    "the extended radio structure of pg  1004 + 130 is also notable : it is one of the prototypical examples discussed by gopal - krishna & wiita ( 2000 ) of a hybrid morphology source possessing both an fr  i and an fr  ii lobe .",
    "the majority of the radio emission in the fr  i south - east ( se ) structure is concentrated in a knotted jet that is most prominent close to the nucleus and then fades into a gradually broadening plume , whereas the north - west ( nw ) structure shows classical fr  ii edge - brightened morphology .",
    "the structure of such hybrid sources is more intuitively explained as arising from the propagation of twin jets into dissimilar large - scale environments rather than by invoking a `` lopsided '' central engine ( gopal - krishna & wiita 2000 ) .",
    "both the extended projected size of pg  1004 + 130 ( @xmath20500 kpc ) and the ratio of lobe - to - core flux ( we measure this to be @xmath2040 at rest - frame 1.7 ghz using first data ) suggest the jet axis is inclined at a relatively large angle to our line of sight , consistent with physical models in which bal winds flow equatorially from the accretion disk . a quantitative lower limit on the inclination to the line - of - sight , @xmath21 ,",

    "further , the lack of any _ hst _ point sources coincident with the x - ray emission restricts the nature of any such background source ; the optical upper limit yields an x - ray - to - optical flux ratio , as defined by maccacaro et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , that is more than @xmath2020 ( @xmath208 ) times greater than the maximum value for agns ( bl lacs ) observed by maccacaro et al .",
    "the x - ray emission is extended along the path of the radio jet , and the peak x - ray brightness in the jet occurs upstream of the peak radio brightness , consistent with the observed trend for the ratio of x - ray - to - radio emission to decrease along jets ( e.g. , marshall et al .",

    "large - scale diffuse x - ray emission is common within groups and clusters , is sometimes seen in halos around rlqs , and has been observed along radio jets .",
    "the intra - group , intra - cluster , and halo x - ray emission is well - established to be thermal radiation from hot gas , but the origin of diffuse x - ray emission along jets is much less certain ; ic / cmb scattering has been suggested as a reasonable explanation ( e.g. , siemiginowska et al .",

    "the hybrid radio morphology of pg  1004 + 130 may suggest that the density of the surrounding medium is higher to the se , where the radio jet is quickly decollimated , than to the nw , where the unseen counterjet powers a distant , edge - brightened lobe , although the lack of any apparent interaction with the few neighboring field galaxies leaves the mechanism for generating such an asymmetrical density distribution unclear .",
    "we do not observe any strong gradient in diffuse x - ray emission from the se to the nw , but naturally this does not prohibit large - scale , asymetrically distributed , colder gas .",
    "however , pg  1004 + 130 does show intriguing diffuse emission along the path of the se jet and nw counterjet .",
    "we verified that this emission was not an artifact of the smoothing process by extracting radial profiles from the rebinned image as with the psf analysis described previously ; here we use the regions indicated in figure 2a to obtain surface - brightness profiles along the jet , counterjet , and non - jet background ( excluding all point sources ) .",
    "figure 2b shows that beyond @xmath2016@xmath6 ( past the se x - ray jet emission ) , the diffuse emission in the jet and counterjet is similar and clearly surpasses the emission from the non - jet background region ; we calculate @xmath2029.3 counts above background in the 0.54 kev diffuse emission from 16@xmath6 to 63@xmath6 to the se , and @xmath2027.4 to the nw . note that the acis readout streak can not contribute significantly to the diffuse emission , as it should contain less than 6 total counts over the jet / counterjet region , is offset by @xmath2015@xmath25 from the jet position angle , and would extend the entire length of the chip . extended x - ray emission around rlqs has occasionally been noted to follow the direction of the radio lobes ( e.g. , croston et al .  2004 ; belsole et al .",

    "data associated with energies below 0.4 kev or above 8.0 kev were discarded for the purposes of fitting ; these cutoffs were imposed due to increasing calibration uncertainties at low energies and declining source counts ( due to decreasing instrumental effective area and the spectral shape ) as well as increasing background at high energies .",
    "all fits include galactic absorption fixed at 3.93@xmath110@xmath31 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "joint fitting of the spectra from the _ xmm - newton _ pn , mos1 , and mos2 detectors increases the signal - to - noise and is consequently preferred in the absence of significant cross - calibration uncertainties . fitting a simple power - law model gives consistent results ( the 90% confidence intervals for both photon index and normalization overlap for the pn , mos1 , and mos2 detectors ) , therefore all model parameters with the exception of normalization have been fit jointly throughout the remainder of the analysis . unless otherwise noted we quote the outcome of fitting various models to the binned spectra with @xmath53 minimization , but the following results agree with those obtained by fitting the ungrouped spectra with the xspec @xmath54-statistic ( after cash 1979 )",

    "examination of the residuals from the power - law fit described above did not show any obvious emission features in the x - ray spectrum of pg  1004 + 130 .",

    "overall , the lack of strong fe k@xmath62 emission argues against a scenario in which the nucleus of pg  1004 + 130 is heavily absorbed and the weak continuum arises chiefly from scattering or reflection .",
    "we extrapolated the 28  kev power - law fits to lower energies to search for x - ray absorption , as illustrated in figures 3a and 3b .",

    "we use standard synchrotron formulae ( e.g. , worrall & birkinshaw 2006 ) for a single - injection model with pitch - angle isotropization ( jaffe & perola 1973 ) . a continuous - injection model , in which the spectral slope steepens by 0.5 above a critical frequency ( e.g. , carilli et al .  1991 ) , would still require an exponential cutoff at frequencies below the optical limit , but a kardashev - pacholczyk ( kardashev 1962 ; pacholczyk 1970 ) model with no pitch - angle scattering would allow a synchrotron cutoff at higher frequencies",
    ". the precise slope of the synchrotron spectrum above the turnover frequency does not greatly affect the x - ray emission , so a kardashev - pacholczyk or continuous - injection model would lead to similar qualitative conclusions .",
    "we derive a magnetic field strength @xmath134 = 14  @xmath37 g , and note that in general @xmath135 = @xmath134/@xmath133 ( e.g. , harris & krawczynski 2002 ) .    a natural explanation for the origin of the x - ray emission would be compton upscattering by the synchrotron electrons .",
    "we consider two sources of seed photons : the synchrotron radiation itself ( ssc ; e.g. , hardcastle et al .",
    "1997 ) or the cosmic microwave background ( ic / cmb ; e.g. tavecchio et al .",
    "2000 ; celotti et al .",
    "2001 ) . at the distance of the x - ray jet ,",
    "the photon flux from the agn or from the host galaxy is comparatively insignificant .",
    "the x - ray emission expected from the ssc process with the above parameters is more than three orders of magnitude less than the observed x - ray flux .",
    "the x - ray ssc emission increases relative to the synchrotron emission if the magnetic - field strength decreases , but radically sub - equipartition fields are required to attribute the observed x - ray flux to ssc emission . a representative model of this type",
    "is included in figure 5 . both the high and low electron - energy cutoffs",
    "have been adjusted to accommodate the optical limit ( 10@xmath13610@xmath137 ) but given the @xmath128  =  2 power - law distribution and the consistent span of 4.3 decades in energy the equipartion magnetic field remains 14 @xmath37 g .",
    "the actual magnetic field required to fit the x - ray flux is then 0.021 @xmath37 g , several hundred times less than the equipartion value .",
    "ic / cmb is often put forward as an explanation for the concave seds of powerful fr  ii jets , and this process is particularly efficient for high - redshift , relativistic jets inclined close to the line of sight . unlike ssc , which is actually depressed by beaming",
    ", x - ray ic / cmb emission is boosted by an additional factor of 1+@xmath62 relative to synchrotron emission ( dermer 1995 ) . in the case of pg  1004 + 130 ,",
    "the expected ic / cmb emission is still several hundred times less than the observed x - ray emission ; the enhanced beaming required to match the x - ray flux , @xmath133=3.0 , would place an upper limit ( where @xmath133 = @xmath55 ) on the jet angle of @xmath13819@xmath25 , smaller than the @xmath24  45@xmath25 suggested from the optical and radio luminosities as well as the radio morphology ( see @xmath501 ) .",
    "further , the lifetime of the low - energy electrons ( @xmath139 10@xmath140 ) responsible for the x - ray emission in ic / cmb models greatly surpasses the length of the jet , and so x - ray emission would be expected to persist along the jet ( absent deceleration ; e.g. , georganopoulos & kazanas  2004 ) . despite the similarities in pg  1004 + 130 to the seds and",
    "x - ray spectra of the core - dominated , highly beamed fr  ii jets that dominate the surveys of both sambruna et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and marshall et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the ic / cmb model commonly applied to such fr  ii jets does not appear to be appropriate for pg  1004 + 130 .",
    "for both ssc and ic / cmb models , the location of the x - ray emission largely upstream of the parent synchrotron electrons is difficult to explain and the predicted x - ray spectral slope is flatter than observed .",
    "we consider it unlikely that the x - ray emission arises from either ssc or ic / cmb emission .",
    "if the x - ray jet emission does not arise as a consequence of the low - energy synchrotron radiation ( as in the ssc and ic / cmb cases ) , then various other emission mechanisms may be considered , such as thermal bremsstahlung or synchrotron emission from a secondary population of high - energy electrons ( e.g. , atoyan & dermer 2004 ) .",
    "the offset of the x - ray and radio emission is perhaps more easily accomodated by such models .",
    "the x - ray emission occupies a rectangular region of approximately 5@xmath6 by 2.4@xmath6 ; for an edge - on cylinder this again corresponds to a volume of 3.6@xmath110@xmath126  @xmath127 .",
    "the best - fit temperature for a bremsstrahlung model is @xmath1415  kev , but this is only poorly constrained . neglecting line emission ( which contributes significantly to the soft x - ray emission at lower temperatures ) , a gas cloud with an average ion charge of @xmath1421 would be required to have a density of @xmath1430.05  @xmath144 to account for the observed x - ray flux .",
    "this corresponds to a total mass of 1.5@xmath110@xmath104  m@xmath105 and an ideal - gas pressure of 4.6@xmath110@xmath145 dynes @xmath3 .",
    "such a large quantity of concentrated hot gas at so great a distance from the host galaxy seems unlikely , and as this gas cloud would be overpressured with respect to the surrounding igm we would have to be observing it at a favorable time before it dispersed . if instead the x - ray emission from pg  1004 + 130 arises from a second synchrotron component generated by a population of highly relativistic electrons , the low - energy cutoff must be high enough to avoid over - predicting the optical flux . taking the magnetic field to be 14  @xmath37 g and setting the electron energy index to be @xmath128=2.4",
    "as indicated by the x - ray photon index , this model provides an acceptable explanation of the x - ray emission with @xmath129=1.6@xmath110@xmath146 , as shown in figure 5 . as the lifetime of the x - ray synchrotron electrons is quite short ( electrons initially associated with 1 kev emission would have half lives of @xmath20600 years ) , multiple acceleration or injection sites are required along the extent of the x - ray jet .",
    "electrons with these injection parameters would lose sufficient energy within @xmath2030,000 years to produce fluxes at optical frequencies in excess of the observed _ hst _ limit , suggesting that the energetic electrons escape the shock region before cooling to energies below @xmath1473@xmath110@xmath131 .",
    "the diffuse emission extends 4050@xmath6 ( 150190 projected kpc ) from the nucleus to both the se and the nw , tracing the path of the fr  i radio jet and providing supporting evidence for the presence of the hidden fr  ii counterjet .",
    "there are insufficient counts for spectral analysis , but with an assumed @xmath55=1.8 power law the 0.58 kev x - ray flux of the se component is 4.5@xmath110@xmath33 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath12 , while that of the nw component is 4.2@xmath110@xmath33 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath12 .",
    "most radio jets are one - sided , with the absence of a detectable counterjet generally attributed to doppler boosting and hence yielding a constraint upon the line - of - sight angle .",
    "as the line - of - sight angle for pg  1004 + 130 is likely @xmath24  45@xmath25 , the jet / counterjet flux ratio for twin jets is expected to be less than @xmath2015 ( using @xmath148^{\\alpha-2}$ ] and @xmath55 = @xmath149 = 1/@xmath150 = 1.4 ; e.g. , worrall & birkinshaw 2006 ) . however , the observed ratio of radio emission in the se jet to that in the undetected nw counterjet exceeds 100 , indicating that doppler boosting alone can not explain the lack of a radio counterjet in pg  1004 + 130 .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission precludes the possibility of an intrinsically one - sided jet , leading us to hypothesize that the entraining environment is indeed less dense to the nw , as suggested by the hybrid radio morphology .",
    "if the diffuse x - ray emission is thermal radiation , then the required gas density is @xmath204.5@xmath110@xmath151  @xmath144 with a total mass of 2.3@xmath110@xmath152  m@xmath105 and a pressure of 1.5@xmath110@xmath153 dynes @xmath3 ; while these parameters are not as restrictive as those for the thermal jet models , similar concerns apply .",
    "the mechanism for heating the gas along the jet is unclear , and a non - thermal origin seems somewhat more plausible .",
    "ssc emission alone is not a viable explanation for the diffuse x - ray emission , as the absence of a detectable radio counterjet to the nw imposes a stringent limit to the available synchrotron photon density above 1 ghz , and the concurrent lack of energetic electrons makes boosting to x - ray frequencies difficult .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission could result from unbeamed ic / cmb emission , and indeed its apparently smooth extent along the entire jet suggests an association with long - lived electrons .",
    "the paucity of radio emission in the nw counterjet region does not greatly affect the ic / cmb x - ray yield , which is driven by low - energy electrons associated with sub - ghz synchrotron radiation .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission unaccompanied by detectable radio emission has been observed in a handful of additional sources and can be successfully attributed to ic / cmb processes in those cases as well ( e.g. , siemiginowska et al .  2002 ; schwartz et al .",
    "the _ vla _",
    "c band limit on radio emission in the nw counterjet allows for considerable leeway in determing the high - energy cutoff and magnetic field required to generate sufficient diffuse x - ray emission via the ic / cmb process . for @xmath154 = 50 and @xmath155",

    "variable complex absorption : although the _ xmm - newton _ observation of pg  1004 + 130 shows only minimal intrinsic absorption , the _ chandra _ spectrum reveals significant soft x - ray absorption that can not be modeled by a simple redshifted neutral absorber .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the preferred partial - covering model are @xmath157  =  1.20@xmath7210@xmath2 @xmath3 , @xmath73  =  0.49@xmath74 , and @xmath55  =  1.37@xmath75 .",
    "the 28  kev _ xmm - newton _ flux is 23% lower than the 28  kev _ chandra _ flux .",
    "x - ray weakness : pg  1004 + 130 has the lowest luminosity - corrected value of @xmath85 among the pg rlqs , and after correcting for intrinsic absorption it is @xmath205.4 times weaker in x - rays than the other pg rlqs , when normalizing to similar optical / uv luminosities .",
    "examination of the sed of pg  1004 + 130 confirms that the anomalous value of @xmath85 is due to x - ray weakness rather than optical / uv brightness .",
    "x - ray jet : the _ chandra _ image reveals an x - ray counterpart to the se radio fr  i jet .",
    "the jet is undetected by _ hst _ , ruling out simple single - component synchrotron emission models , and both the x - ray spectrum and the multiwavelength sed shape are similar to those observed for prominent knots in fr ii jets . diffuse x - ray emission",
    "is observed along the path of the jet and counterjet .",
    "complex x - ray absorption is common in radio - quiet bal quasars ( e.g. , gallagher et al .",
    "2002 , 2006 ) and may be inferred by x - ray weakness coupled with relatively soft x - ray spectra for radio - loud bal quasars as well ( brotherton et al .",

    "the more absorbed _ chandra _",
    "spectrum for pg  2112 + 059 required either an ionized or partially covering absorber to fit the flat soft x - ray region and also revealed fe k@xmath62 emission undetectable against the higher continuum of the earlier _ asca _ observation , with a rest - frame equivalent width of 1050@xmath158  ev .",
    "the best - fit @xmath0 for pg  1004 + 130 is relatively low compared with that of most radio - quiet bal quasars , as is the covering fraction ( cf .",
    "green et al . 2001 ) .",
    "together these results suggest that the nature of the x - ray absorber is broadly similar in radio - quiet and radio - loud bal quasars , but that the column density associated with the observed x - ray absorption is lower in radio - loud bal quasars , somewhat analogous to the trend for uv absorption to be stronger in radio - quiet bal quasars than in radio - loud bal quasars @xcite .",
    "although notably x - ray weak relative to non - bal rlqs , pg  1004 + 130 is not as x - ray weak as the bal rlqs examined by brotherton et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and it is possible that pg  1004 + 130 is simply an intrinsically x - ray weak rlq that also shows variable absorption .",
    "alternative hypotheses as to the cause of the x - ray weakness of pg  1004 + 130 are constrained by the characteristics of the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ spectra .",
    "the x - ray weakness can not be attributed solely to attenuation by simple intrinsic neutral absorption , as the required high column densities would result in x - ray spectra significantly harder than observed .",
    "if much of the intrinsic x - ray emission is hidden by heavy absorption of significantly higher column density ( @xmath1595@xmath110@xmath160  @xmath3 ) than that indicated by the flat spectral shape , the observed x - ray spectrum could result from photons leaking through `` holes '' in the absorber or scattering off a `` torus '' or electron - cloud mirror into the line of sight .",
    "however , the absence of strong fe k@xmath62 emission is somewhat surprising if the latter scenario is correct , and pg  1004 + 130 is actually brighter in x - rays than expected for a reflection - dominated continuum .",
    "if the nucleus is obscured for photon energies up to @xmath5  8  kev ( or extremely weak in x - rays ) , it is also possible that we are viewing x - ray emission from a subparsec - scale jet ; this may provide a natural explanation for the absence of prominent fe k@xmath62 emission , as well as the observed lack of excess low - energy emission that distinguishes the x - ray spectra of pg  1004 + 130 from those of other quasars .",
    "motivated by the observed correlation between radio and optical luminosity for narrow - line radio galaxies , chiaberge et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggested a synchrotron origin for the nuclear optical emission from these sources .",
    "this correlation has been extended to the x - ray band by evans et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who argue that fr i rlqs derive a significant fraction of their ( generally unabsorbed ) nuclear x - ray emission from an unresolved jet , while fr ii rlqs are dominated by ( absorbed ) accretion - powered x - ray emission but also contain a jet spectral component . in the particular case of pg  1004 + 130 ,",
    "the complexity and intermediate column density of the absorption in the observed _ chandra _ x - ray spectrum could plausibly be attributed to viewing the jet through progressively diminishing bal - wind column densities with increasing distance from the nucleus .",
    "x - ray spectra with improved photon statistics and resolution are required to constrain better the physical nature of the nuclear x - ray emission , or it may also be possible to detect direct x - rays in the @xmath5 8200  kev band if the putative absorption does not exceed @xmath1612@xmath110@xmath162  @xmath3 ( e.g. , matt  2002 ) .",
    "detection of rapid x - ray variability would restrict the size of the emission region and limit the degree to which reprocessed radiation could contribute to the observed continuum , but neither the _ xmm - newton _ nor the _ chandra _ observation shows such variability .",
    "identification of the x - ray emission mechanism in the pg  1004 + 130 jet would be aided by an optical detection of the jet and determination of the frequency and nature of the break in the sed between radio and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "however , we consider it unlikely that the x - ray jet is dominated by ic / cmb emission , and instead favor the x - ray emission arising from a second synchrotron component .",
    "as with other x - ray jets ( e.g. , marshall et al .",
    "2002 ; sambruna et al .",
    "2004 ) , the x - ray jet of pg  1004 + 130 peaks in brightness upstream of the brightest radio knot .",
    "this suggests that x - ray synchrotron emission may be more prominent in the inner jet , either because of stronger magnetic fields or a supply of highly energetic electrons ( e.g. , sambruna et al .",
    "the agreement in the multiwavelength properties of the pg  1004 + 130 jet with those of other fr  ii jets indicates that the fr  i radio morphology is likely due to propagation into a dense environment rather than intrinsically lower power , as suggested by .",
    "the orientation of the jet axis demonstrates that concave jet seds can arise without substantial beaming .",
