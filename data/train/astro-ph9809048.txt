    "gro j1744 - 28 is the first known x - ray source both bursting and pulsating ( see rappaport & joss 1997 , aptekar et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "the source is in a binary system , the x - ray pulsation period is 467 ms , the orbital period is 11.8 days , the mass function of this system is @xmath0 , the time interval between bursts is about 30 minutes , and the duration of the bursts is about 5 seconds .",
    "there is not any distinct difference between the spectra of the bursts and persistent emission , and the typical photon energy is about 14 kev .",
    "when bursting , there are post - burst dips in the persistent flux and phase - lags .",
    "the phase of the pulse profile during bursts lags the phase prior to the bursts by @xmath1-@xmath2 .",
    "any theoretical model should make clear that , such as , how matter accretes onto the surface of gro j1744 - 28 , how the bursts produce , why there are phase - lags and post - burst dips , etc .",
    "usually , people believe that the source could be well explained by a complex accreting process onto neutron star",
    ". one of this kind of model believe that the bursts are the result of accretion instability ( type ii x - ray bursts , lewin et al .",
    "1996 ) , which has been studied in the rapid burster ( mxb 1730 - 335 ) . on the oher hand ,",
    "bildsten & brown ( 1997 ) show that the bursts observed during the peak of the outburst are most likely not the thermonuclear origin , i.e. , gro j1744 - 28 could not be type i x - ray burster .    however , cheng et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have shown the possibility that the burst energy is the result of phase transition of accreted matter from normal hadron to three - flavor strange quark matter .",
    "hence , they concluded that gro j1744 - 28 might be an accreting strange star . in their discussion",
    ", they address that gro j1744 - 28 is a strange star with a normal matter crust .",
    "when the accreted mass exceeds some critical mass , the crust breaks , resulting in the phase transition and the energy release .",
    "xu & qiao ( 1998 ) argued that the normal matter crust is not necessary for the strange star model of pulsars .",
    "if a strange star ( alcock et al . 1986 ) forms soon after a supernova , a magnetosphere mainly composed by @xmath3 would soon be established , and the strange star could act as a radio pulsar .",
    "there are some advantages if radio pulsars are bare strange stars rather than neutron stars or strange stars with crust .",
    "while strange stars are in binaries , there could be two envelope crusts shielding the two polar caps of the accreting strange stars .",
    "following this idea , we propose a model for gro j1744 - 28 , which is similar to that by cheng et al.(1998 ) .",
    "we argue that gro j1744 - 28 might not own a unified crust , but two polar crusts .",
    "bursts are the result of phase transition of polar crusts if one accreting crust is heavier than that the coulomb force can support .",
    "this phase transition process could be unstable , similar to the case discussed by horvath & benvenuto ( 1988 ) .",
    "it is shown that there should be phase - lags when bursting crust is expanded about one hundred meters , a scale length in order of the crust thickness .",
    "about the phase - lag , miller ( 1996 ) has suggested that when accretion rate rises , the flattened accretion flow shift to a different set of field lines .",
    "therefore , the time of pulse maximum would change accordingly , and a phase - lag results .",
    "our model is different from this scenario .",
    "as @xmath4 quark is slightly heavier than @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks , there are @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath4 quarks and electrons for the chemical and electrical equilibrium of strange quark matter .",
    "since the quark matter are bound up through strong interaction , and the electrons are held to the quark matter electrically , the electrons distribution would extend beyond the quark matter surface several hundred fm , and there is a strong electric field near the quark surface . using the thomas - fermi model , one can obtain the electric field @xmath7 as a function of the height above the quark surface @xmath8 ( xu & qiao , 1998 , equ .",
    "a5-a6 ) , @xmath9 where , the direction of the electric field is outward , and the potential energy of quark matter @xmath10 has been chosen to be 20 mev , @xmath11 cm ) .",
    "as matter accreting on to the polar caps , the strange quark matter should repulse atomic nuclei , and two crusts are formed in the two polar caps . assuming the density of the crust is @xmath12 , the distance @xmath13 between nuclei is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is proton mass , @xmath16 is the mass number of nucleus , @xmath17 , @xmath18 g @xmath19 . if @xmath12 approximates neutron drip density , @xmath20 ( glendenning et al .",
    "1995 ) , then @xmath13 is order of the electric gap height(alcock et al .",
    "1986 ) .    by simulation",
    ", huang & lu ( 1997 ) argued that the electric gap between crust and strange quark matter is too small to support the crust before the density at the bottom rises to the neutron drip density . because of the repulsion between nuclei and strange quark matter , there should be a charge separation near the bottom of crust .",
    "hence there would be an effective positively charged column density @xmath21 , which could be estimated as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a coefficient denoting the effective ( positive ) chargement , @xmath24 is charge number of atomic nucleus , @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the charge of electron .",
    "hence , by equilibrium between electrical and gravitational forces , the column density @xmath27 of crust can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the mass and radius of strange quark matter , respectively , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the gravitational constants .",
    "the height @xmath33 of the crust is @xmath34 for a spherical crust , the total mass @xmath35 should be @xmath36 which is a typical value of simulated results ( e.g. huang & lu 1997 ) . for @xmath37 ( the length scale of strong interaction is @xmath38 ) , we get the maximum values of column density @xmath39 and of spherical total mass @xmath40 , @xmath41    if the mass of the crust is known , the distance between the crust and strange quark matter should be ( from equ.(2 ) ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "it is shown from above equation that the crust becomes heavier as matter accretes , the thickness of the electric gap becomes smaller .",
    "as matter accreting to the polar cap crusts , the column density of crusts could be more and more higher , until a catastrophe of crust takes place when @xmath44 , because the strong interaction length is of order 1 fm .",
    "this crush of crust could trigger a burst process in gro j1744 - 18 .",
    "when a crush happens , the strange quark core should swallow part of normal matter at the bottom of the crust",
    ". this process could not be unstable ( possibly in a detonation mode ) , which might be similar to that discussed by horvath & benvenuto ( 1988 ) .    before going to some details of the model for gro j1744 - 28",
    ", we would like to briefly review the three types of particular bursts .",
    "there are two types of x - ray bursts , which we call them as type i and type ii bursts(lewin et al .",
    ". the ratios of steady emission to time averaged burst emission in type i bursts , @xmath45 , and in type ii bursts , @xmath46 , are @xmath47 respectively , while , the eddington luminosity @xmath48 . for the bursts in gro j1744 - 18 , in the early 1995 dec .",
    ", when the burst intervals were @xmath49 minutes , the @xmath50 upper limit of the ratio of integrated energy in the persistent flux to that in bursts was @xmath51 ( lewin et al .",
    "1996 ) , i.e. , @xmath52    there are three main energy sources in the x - ray emission by unit nucleon .",
    "first , the gravitational accretion energy , @xmath53 .",
    "second , the thermonuclear reaction energy from pure hydrogen into helium , @xmath54 , and from helium into iron - peak elements , @xmath55 .",
    "third , the energy liberated in the phase transition from normal hadron into strange quark matter , @xmath56 .",
    "they are @xmath57    for type i x - ray bursts caused by nuclear flash , the observed ratios @xmath45 are from @xmath58 to @xmath59 . for type ii x - ray bursts , which are the results of accretion instability , the observed ratios @xmath60 if the time averaged accretion rates during bursts and between bursts are similar .    while , for the busting x - ray pulsar , gro j1744 - 28 , there should be a phase transition from hadron to three - flavor quark matter when the crust crashes .",
    "nevertheless , the energy release from the phase transition could trigger the thermonuclear reactions in the crust .",
    "hence , the ratio of steady emission to time averaged burst emission could be @xmath61 , which is comparable to the observed @xmath62 .",
    "the polar cap area of the crust , @xmath63 , is @xmath64 where , @xmath65 $ ] , and @xmath66 is the radius of light cylinder , @xmath67 is the radius of magnetosphere ( rappaport & joss , 1997 ) , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the magnetic field , @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the accretion rate , @xmath72 , @xmath73s is the period of rotation , @xmath74 is the velocity of light .",
    "hence ( let @xmath75 ) , @xmath76    the typical interval between bursts is about 30 minutes ( aptekar et al .",
    "we assume the bursting and accreting processes are in quasi - equilibrium , and the total energy release during a burst is @xmath77 the durative time during bursts @xmath78s ( aptekar et al .",
    "1998 ) , then the busting luminosity @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , the crust should be expanded very much , which could be the reason for the observed phase - lag ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath80 is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the stefan - boltzmann s constant . while , in observation for gro j1744 - 28 , x - rays from 10 to 100 kev have been detected .",
    "also , the column density @xmath83 of phase transition matter in the crush of crust should be @xmath84 and the extent scale @xmath85 of phase transition matter can be estimated as @xmath86 which means only a small faction of matter in the crust has been transformed from hadron into three - flavor quark matter .      in equ.(3 ) , it is said that @xmath87 .",
    "in fact , as the temperature of the crust is not zero , ions can penetrate a small potential barrier with height of @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath90 is the temperature of matter at the base of the crust . from equ.(a6 )",
    "@xmath91 of xu & qiao ( 1998 ) , we get the differential relation of @xmath92 and @xmath8 as @xmath93 for @xmath94mev , @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath95mev ( the charge number @xmath24 of ion is chosen to be 26 ) , then @xmath96 . from equ . ( 2 ) , the differential relation of @xmath27 and @xmath8 is @xmath97 for @xmath94mev , @xmath37 .",
    "hence , if @xmath98mev , @xmath99 , which means equ .",
    "( 3 ) is a good approximation for the maximum value of column density .",
    "when the accreting crust is heavier than that the coulomb force can support , the bottom part of the crust should be pushed through the coulomb barrier .",
    "the released energy from phase transition would heat up the bottom crust , and according to the differential relations of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , more ions should penetrate the coulomb barrier . in a word",
    ", a positive feedback process happens . if the temperature in the feedback process ( and _ before _ the crust have taken a global expansion )",
    "is risen to be @xmath102 , while @xmath103 is assumed to be order of @xmath104 mev , the total mass been pushed through should be order of @xmath105 ( _ note _ :",
    "@xmath106 ) @xmath107 @xmath108 .",
    "as discussed below , the bursting can cause matter being expanded large enough to drag matter to latter phase , and the observed phase - lag can be explained .    the total mass of one polar cap crust @xmath109 is @xmath110 let @xmath111 be the inclination angle ( fig.1 ) , the total rotational energy of the polar crust is @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the angular velocity of the star .",
    "when bursting , the matter of crust could be expanded to a maximum height @xmath114 ( fig.1 ) . assuming this expanded crust has a uniform angular velocity @xmath115 , from rotational energy conservation ,    @xmath116 we get @xmath117 if there is a expansion in the crust , @xmath118 , then @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , in the corotation frame , the crust matter would be drag to a later phase , and the total drag kinetic energy @xmath120 is @xmath121 ^ 2\\\\ & = & { 1\\over 6 } m_{\\rm polar } \\omega_0 ^ 2\\sin^2\\alpha(r^2+rr+r^2)(1-\\sqrt{3r^2\\over r^2+rr+r^2})^2 . \\end{array}\\ ] ] while , in the corotation frame , the magnetic force for matter to get back is @xmath122 since the maxswell tense force is @xmath123 ( alfven & falthammar 1963 ) .",
    "so , the shifted distance can be estimated as @xmath124 here the function @xmath125 is @xmath126 \\cdot ( 1-\\sqrt{3r^2\\over r^2+rr+r^2})^2 . \\;\\ ; \\eqno(8)\\ ] ] the degree of phase - lag @xmath127 is ( for @xmath37 ) , @xmath128 the numerical calculation of @xmath125 show that @xmath127 could be consistent with observed phase - lags if @xmath129 or @xmath130 meters .",
    "a model for gro j1744 - 28 is suggested in this paper , with which many observational properties , such as the phase - lags , the burst energy and the characteristic photon energy , could be explained well and simply .",
    "there might be two polar cap crusts of gro j1744 - 28 .",
    "the intermittent phase transition of polar crusts could result in the burst process when an accreting crust is heavier than that the coulomb force can support .",
    "bildsten & brown ( 1997 ) argue that the bursts of gro j1744 - 28 during the peak of the outburst are most likely not the thermonuclear origin . nevertheless , if the energy release by phase transition is considered , the thermonuclear reactions could have contribution to the bursting process in gro j1744 - 28 .",
    "taam & picklum ( 1978 , 1979 ) recognized that if hydrogen burns at sufficiently high density ( @xmath131 g @xmath19 ) in the envelop of an accreting neutron star , helium must eventually burn within the same mass layer .",
    "this mixed burn of hydrogen and helium could occur in the accreting crust of gro j1744 - 28 , which might be triggered by the energy release of phase transition .",
    "eventually , a burst appears , with a global expansion of @xmath132 meters in the crust .",
    "rappaport & joss ( 1997 ) think that x - ray pulsars , gro j1744 - 28 , the rapid burster , and type i x - ray bursters are in a series when the crucial parameter b ( magnetic field ) decreases .",
    "however , the magnetic field of the recently discovered bursting x - ray millisecond pulsars , sax j1808.4 - 3658 , is only @xmath133 gauss ( wijnands & klis 1998 ) .",
    "the spectra of gro j1744 - 28 and sax j1808.4 - 3658 are hard .",
    "the characteristic photon energy of gro j1744 - 28 is comparable to most other x - ray pulsars but higher than other x - ray bursters .",
    "on the other hand , sax j1808.4 - 3658 has a remarkably stable crab - like power law spectrum ( gilfanov et al . 1998 ) .",
    "where and why is sax j1808.4 - 3658 in the series of rappaport & joss ( 1997 ) ?",
    "we have to deal with the radiative mechanism of x - ray emission in gro j1744 - 28 and sax j1808.4 - 3658 .",
    "the general standard pulsar high - energy emission mechanism could not work well .",
    "nevertheless , a revised version of the standard mechanism considering the electromagnetic effect of accretion disk could be a good candidate - model for the radiative process of bursting pulsars .",
    "detailed research in this scenario should be necessary .",
