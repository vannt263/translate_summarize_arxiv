    "low dimensional systems based on magnetic material have attracted considerable attention lately in a number of subjects such as condensed matter physics , material science and inorganic chemistry . in these particular areas quantum ferrimagnetic chains ( qfc ) were discussed , due to that they exhibit a relevant combination of ferromagnetic ( f ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) states .",
    "experimental synthetization of the compound cu(3-clpy)@xmath0(n@xmath1)@xmath0@xcite with clpy indicating chloropyridine had been investigated .",
    "this compound could be mapped into a spin-1/2 tetramer chain with f - f - af - af bond alternation@xcite . recently",
    "diamond type chain structures have been intensively investigated theoretically and experimentally@xcite .",
    "the natural candidates to describes these kinds of materials are the quantum anisotropic heisenberg model or even ising type models .",
    "certainly the rigorous mapping of those compounds into heisenberg type models could become very complex systems which usually have non exact solution .",
    "however some particular case of models could become exactly solvable such as the ising - heisenberg model considered by jascur and strecka@xcite , a more detailed discussion also considered by canova et al.@xcite .",
    "the method used to solve this kind of models is the historical fisher s work@xcite of decorated transformation method , proposed in 50 s decade , the improvement of the method is discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "many other quasi - unidimensional ising type models were solved using this methods@xcite .",
    "recently , theoretical investigation of strongly geometrical frustration materials@xcite have been performed , particularly focused on the diamond chain structure , using several numerical approaches@xcite .",
    "these theoretical results could enhance the other experimental realizations provided by the polymeric compounds such as cu2oso4@xcite and m3(oh)2 ( with m = ni , co , mn)@xcite .",
    "other quasi - unidimensional heisenberg models were studied using numerical results such as discussed in references @xcite and some analytical series expansion also has been performed@xcite for similar systems .",
    "this work aim is to present the frustrated properties of the asymmetric tetrahedron ising heisenberg ( atih ) chain , this models can be solved exactly mapping for an effective ising chain with spins 1/2 or 1 using the method presented by fisher@xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follow , in section 2 , we present the atih chain , considering heisenberg interaction with spin 1/2 and 1 . in section 3 , we discuss the phase diagram at zero temperature shown a rich phase diagram and several critical points , for the spin-(1/2,1/2 ) ising - xyz chain and spin-(1,1/2 ) ising - xxz chain . in section 4 , we discuss the thermodynamics properties for ising - heisenberg chain with ising spin @xmath2=1/2 or 1 and heisenberg interaction spin @xmath3=1/2 or 1 , we also considered the correlation function using the decorated transformation method@xcite . finally in section 5 ,",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "the asymmetric tetrahedral ising - heisenberg ( atih ) chain is composed by all edges of tetrahedron ( dashed line fig.1 ) represented by ising type interaction except one which is represented by heisenberg type interaction ( solid line in fig .",
    "1 ) , which can be viewed also as ising - heisenberg diamond chain . to obtain the atih chain we coupled the vertex composed only by the ising type _ interaction edge _ , we call from now on just as ising _ interaction vertex _ , and connecting to another ising _ interaction vertex _ of other tetrahedron . on the other hand the asymmetric edge of the tetrahedron are represented by heisenberg type interaction , that we simply call as heisenberg _ interaction edge _",
    "( interaction between sites @xmath4 in fig.1 ) .",
    "the schematic representation of the atih model is given in fig.1 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the atih chain discussed above could be written by the following expression @xmath5.\\ ] ] with @xmath6 being the spin of ising _ interaction vertex _ , where @xmath7 is the interaction parameter .",
    "the last term included in eq .",
    "correspond to the heisenberg _ interaction edge _ , which is given by@xmath8 being @xmath9 the spin matrices with @xmath10 and @xmath11 are their interaction parameter among sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we can also include the longitudinal external magnetic field in the hamiltonian , which read as @xmath14,\\]]here @xmath15 is an external magnetic field acting on spin @xmath16 , whereas @xmath17 is an external magnetic field acting on @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "note that we are considering different external magnetic fields because we assume that the gyromagnetic factor acting on @xmath16 could be different from that gyromagnetic factor acting on @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which we report as @xmath20 with @xmath21 being their relative gyromagnetic factor .",
    "is symmetric hamiltonian in relation to the exchange @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "on the other hand we note that the hamiltonian ( [ a3 ] ) also has an internal spin symmetry @xmath24 .      to perform the partial summation over decorated site , we need to diagonalize the xyz _ interaction edge _ hamiltonian ( [ a3a ] ) , to evaluate this , we introduce the notations @xmath25 and @xmath26 . for the spin @xmath27 , we obtain the diagonalized hamiltonian @xmath28with diag ( ) we represents diagonal elements of the hamiltonian , and conveniently we use the notation for simplicity @xmath29 and @xmath30 . thus the eigenvalues are given by@xmath31 with @xmath32here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are dependents of the spins @xmath35 and @xmath36 , thus we write from now on just as @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively . each eigenvalues are given by eq . which depend of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , then we have 16 eigenvalues .",
    "after diagonalize the hamiltonian function we get the corresponding set of eigenvectors also , thus the new basis are given by @xmath39where the factors @xmath40 , @xmath41 depends of spins @xmath35 and @xmath36 which are given by the following values @xmath42the normalized eigenvectors @xmath43 and @xmath44 belonging to the eigenvalues @xmath45 and @xmath46 given by  ( [ a5 ] )",
    ". we also remark that the eigenvectors @xmath47 are independents of the spins @xmath35 and @xmath36 or we can say it is four - fold degenerated .    at this point we would like to comment about the relations of the @xmath48 and @xmath49 factors . from ( [ e1c ] ) , it is not difficult to note that these factors transform one eigenvector of eq . into the other one , when we exchange the following values , @xmath50 this property could be valid in more general situation , even in the presence of an external magnetic field . however , it is important to point out that the eigenvalues of eq.([a5 ] ) does not have a similar transformation .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath51 will always be at higher energy level than the eigenfunction @xmath52 . in the case of null magnetic field ( @xmath53 )",
    "we have these coefficients given by @xmath54 these properties will be useful when we discuss the phase diagram properties",
    ".      now we can consider xxz interaction among sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( see fig.1 ) , with spin @xmath55 case .",
    "we diagonalize the hamiltonian analogous to the previous case .",
    "after diagonalizing the hamiltonian depends only of @xmath35 and @xmath36 and read as @xmath56with diag ( ) we represents diagonal elements of the hamiltonian , whereas the eigenvalues are given by @xmath57where @xmath37 and @xmath38 already was defined by the eqs . and .",
    "now for a complete analyze of the atih model , we shall turn our attention to study the @xmath58 _ interaction edge _ for the decorated spin-1 .",
    "in this situation we have nine eigenvector after diagonalizing the hamiltonian , corresponding to the eigenvalues ( [ a8 - 1]-[a8 ] ) , thus the normalized eigenvectors are @xmath59 and @xmath60 are respectively given by @xmath61 at this point , we have a similar situation as was pointed out in eq.([exchange ] ) , i.e. , these factors transform as @xmath62 again this conclusion is valid even when an external magnetic field is included .    after rewritten the heisenberg _ interaction edge _ hamiltonian in the diagonal form we are able to discuss the phase diagram for whole quasi - unidimensional chain for both cases xyz _ interaction edge _ with spin-1/2 and xxz _ interaction edge _ with spin-1 .",
    "to study the phase diagram of the asymmetric tetrahedral spin-(1/2,1/2 ) ising - xyz chain we use the diagonalized version of the hamiltonian presented in the previous section 2.1",
    ". we would like to note that for the present considered model , we have a set of sixteen different state vectors , nevertheless , when the translation and the global spin inversion symmetry are taking into account , we obtain that only eight state vectors have different phases .    as we mentioned above some state vectors are physically equivalents , for example , the state vectors @xmath63 and @xmath64 corresponding to the same state when we consider the global spin inversion .",
    "once the eigenvalues satisfy the relations @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which restrict the eigenvectors to only eight relevant energy states .",
    "so we obtain the following eight states vectors for the asymmetric tetrahedral spin-(1/2,1/2 ) ising - xyz chain@xmath67 ) , and the next element represent the xyz _ interaction edge _ considered in the previous section .",
    "all products are carried out over all spin sites . in these relations the single ising site magnetization @xmath68",
    "is given for the spin-1/2 and @xmath69 is the single heisenberg magnetization for the @xmath12 , @xmath13 sites ( heisenberg _ interaction edge _ ) .",
    "the first two states ( [ e3 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) are new states and arise when we consider the total ising-@xmath70 case and their magnetization @xmath71 depends of the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath72 and @xmath17 .",
    "these states we will call in general `` quantum ferromagnetic '' ( qfo ) states of type i and ii , respectively , which are not degenerated and from ( [ e1a ] ) it is possible to see that the probability of the spin alignment , defined by the functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 are not equivalents for the up and down orientation .",
    "worth remark that this `` quantum ferromagnetic '' state could become quantum ferrimagnetic state when @xmath71 or @xmath73 is negative .",
    "the energy states of ( [ e4a ] ) and ( [ e4b ] ) also have the structure of the first two states but now the probability of the up and down orientation are equivalent , these states are non - degenerated , we call also these state as qfo states of type iii and iv respectively . the states ( [ e5])-([e8 ] ) display four frustrated ( fru ) states of types i , ii , iii and iv respectively , and are non - degenerated . for these states we use an extended modified unitary cell necessary for the identification of equivalent vector states .    in fig.2",
    ", we show the ground - state phase diagram for the system in the absence of the magnetic field ( @xmath74 ) . in fig.2a",
    "let us to consider the following re - parametrization for the interaction parameters , without loosing any physical generality , @xmath75    here we represent the interaction parameter by means of two new parameters @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "for the first two states ( eq . [ e3 ] and [ e4 ] ) we obtain that the heisenberg _ interaction edge _ magnetization takes the value , @xmath78 , thus for @xmath79 we have @xmath80 and for @xmath81 we obtain @xmath82 .",
    "certainly , by using this new parameters we restrict the values of interaction parameters as follows : @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in this limited region",
    "we have competing interaction parameters , leading to several ground state energies . out of this region there are no new phases .",
    "it is possible to see that in this phase diagram , we have five tricritical points where converge three states and two four - critical points where converge four states . in the last case we have that these points are located in the vertical line @xmath86 , for this position",
    "the value obtained from ( [ e10 ] ) is @xmath87 , i.e. , in this region the system has pure heisenberg interaction for @xmath4 sites , and in general , this region is defined by the line where a continuous phase transitions occurs .",
    "we are able to calculate the other interaction parameters corresponding to these two critical points @xmath88 , thus we have that for the points @xmath89 and @xmath90 the interaction parameters takes the values @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , @xmath94 , respectively . in principle",
    "we must plot in fig.2a for the parameters @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the interval @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "but in order to highlight the rich region in the interval @xmath96 $ ] , we considered it only up to @xmath97 the @xmath76 parameter , since we have the continuation of the states @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 . on the other hand ,",
    "in the @xmath77 axis we have also repeated states ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath99 ) which are also present in the interval considered in fig .",
    "we will use the same considerations in the next figures .    in the region where the axis takes the values @xmath104 , we have that the interaction parameter @xmath105 , i.e. it is positive defined , and for the region @xmath106 we obtain a negative value for the parameter @xmath107 . in general negative values for interaction parameters",
    "favors the anti - parallel alignment for the spin ordered system .",
    "thus define the type of phase ordered state whatever is @xmath108 or @xmath109 sates ( left and right side at the axis @xmath86 in the diagram ) . at this stage",
    "it is necessary to point out that the phase state @xmath99 appears in both sectors ( grey sector of fig.2a ) , basically this occurs by the fact that the constant @xmath49 is different from zero . as will be mentioned below , if the constant @xmath49 comes close to zero , the region @xmath99 of the left hand side disappears .",
    "the other five tricritical points can be found by a simple substitution , for example the point @xmath110 is where the phase states @xmath111 , @xmath103 and @xmath99 coexist .",
    "other tricritical points are @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 .    if we impose the condition @xmath116 , i.e. for the @xmath58 model , the eight states reduce to seven , six of them will appear in the phase diagram .",
    "this is possible because in the limit @xmath117 the constants @xmath48 and @xmath49 become @xmath118 and @xmath119 respectively , doing the states @xmath120 equivalent .",
    "we give in fig.2(b ) , the ground - state energy for regions resulting from the substitution @xmath121 and where six phases for the ground - states energy are shown .",
    "it is easy to see that the states vectors become @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "for convenient reasons we use the following realization @xmath124 and obtain now a ferromagnetic ( @xmath125 ) and ferrimagnetic ( @xmath126 ) states .",
    "it is possible to see that the @xmath86 axis still present in these phase configuration . on this line",
    "three critical points are shown where four ground - states converge .",
    "the phase diagram displayed in fig.2 , shows several states due to the presence of the @xmath127 interaction , i.e. the @xmath128 term ( with @xmath129 ) given by ( [ gama ] ) allows us to consider this interaction . in reference",
    "@xcite the term @xmath127 was considered null .",
    "if we put @xmath130 and at the same time impose the equality of some of the interaction parameters , we obtain a very simple phase diagram .",
    "this is graphically displayed in fig.3 .",
    "the fig.3(a ) shows that in the case @xmath130 , @xmath116 , some states are degenerated , so we identify the @xmath100 and @xmath103 as having the same energy .",
    "the same occurs with the @xmath98 and @xmath111 states .",
    "the @xmath125 and @xmath126 states also appear in this diagram .",
    "the fig.3b shows that for the case @xmath130 , @xmath131 we obtain the more simple configuration with three phases , the @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath108 states .",
    "only one three - critical point where these states converges is present in @xmath132 . at this stage",
    "we would like to remark that a very similar ground state configuration was obtained in @xcite , however , the realizations used in our work ( [ e10 ] ) and ( [ e10a ] ) are different from those used in @xcite , because we did not include the external magnetic field .      to obtain all states we need to consider the coupling of the decorated vector states ( [ sp1]-[sp4 ] ) with the ising _",
    "interaction vertex _ with spin-@xmath133 , this enable us to write down the total vector states of the system .",
    "we will restrict the conditions over the interaction parameters without losing the generality , using the following values for the interaction parameters @xmath134 in the following lines we also restrict the system to the case when the external magnetic field is absent ( @xmath129 , @xmath135 ) . from all possible twenty - four ground - states energy , which can be obtained from the system only fifteen eigenvalues have different values .",
    "in this situation the ground - state eigenvectors for the asymmetric spin-(1/2,1 ) ising - xxz chain , that would appear in the phase diagrams are given by @xmath136 where the first element inside the product corresponds to the ising interaction taking two possible values ( @xmath137 ) , and the next element represents the xxz _ interaction edge _ considered in the previous section 2.2 .",
    "the eq . represents a ferromagnetic ( fm ) state , eq .",
    "indicate a ferrimagnetic ( fri ) state , whereas eqs .",
    "- corresponds to quantum ferromagnetic ( qfo ) state of type i , ii and iii respectively .",
    "we also have two types of quantum ferrimagnetic ( qfi ) states given by eq . and , and finally eq . represents a frustrated ( fru ) state .",
    "all these states given by ( [ sp5]-[sp12 ] ) are displayed in the phase diagram presented in fig.4(a ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the line @xmath86 divides the @xmath109 states from the other ones .",
    "therefore in this case we have a seven - critical point in ( @xmath138 ) where all states converge .    in order order to display the first vector state ( [ sp5 ] ) , which not present in fig.4a",
    ", we change the restriction over the interaction parameters and fixed as follow @xmath139 the phase diagram is given in the fig.4(b ) , where the @xmath125 state appears , the other states were already presented in the fig.4(a ) .",
    "finally it is quite interesting to mention that the state given by eq .",
    "also appear when the next nearest interaction parameter considered is null , such as considered in reference @xcite i.e. when @xmath140 , and the restriction is extended over the decorated interaction parameters , for example , if we put @xmath141 we obtain the more simple phase diagram with four states as displayed in the fig.5 .",
    "the @xmath125 and the @xmath126 states are separated by the @xmath86 line and they end up in the @xmath98 and @xmath142 . similar phase diagram was presented in the work @xcite with zero external magnetic field and zero next - nearest interaction parameter . in the work",
    "@xcite they also consider an external magnetic field but with zero next nearest interaction parameter where a similar phase diagrams were obtained , as displayed in the fig.4 and 5(a ) .",
    "so we conclude that the inclusion of the ( @xmath143 ) interaction enable us to investigate a rich number of states even in the absence of an external magnetic field",
    ". both restrictions ( [ sp13]-[sp14 ] ) give the value for the ground - state energy @xmath144 .",
    "thermodynamics properties could be studied using the known decorated transformation spin proposed in reference @xcite .",
    "let us write the partition function as follow @xmath145where @xmath146 is the number of decorated bounds , whereas the tr@xmath147  stands for the trace of the central decorated system or heisenberg _ interaction edge _ ( in our case ) , while by @xmath148 we represent the boltzmann weight .",
    "one should notice that the transformation ( [ d1 ] ) is rather general , since it is valid for arbitrary spin values contained in the decorated site . the set @xmath149 represents the ising _",
    "interaction vertex _ and would take any spin value too . in this section",
    "we study the ising - heisenberg chain where the ising _",
    "interaction vertex _ take the spin values @xmath27 or 1 .",
    "the atih chain partition function can be expressed as @xmath150where @xmath151 is the partition function of the effective ising chain with arbitrary spin-@xmath3 , whereas @xmath152 means a constant for the effective ising chain .",
    "when decorated heisenberg _ interaction edge _ sites are occupied by spin-1/2 or 1 , it is necessary to perform the partial trace over all those decorated spin sites .      in order to map the atih chain into an effective ising chain ,",
    "let us consider the ising _",
    "interaction vertex _ with spin-1/2 . for this case",
    "the associated boltzmann weight function @xmath153 has the form @xmath154 where @xmath155 and @xmath156 are given by eq . for @xmath27 ( spin of decorated sites )",
    "whereas the associated boltzmann weight for spin @xmath55 could be obtained using the eqs.- , then the atih chain model considered here is written by    @xmath157    the effective ising chain partition function is represented by their boltzmann weight function @xmath158 which read as @xmath159 using decorated transformation , we obtain the new parameters for the effective ising chain ,    @xmath160    where the new effective parameters of ising chain can be expressed as a function of the parameter of the original hamiltonian .",
    "thus @xmath152 is just a constant , whereas @xmath161 means a coupling parameter and finally @xmath162 corresponds to the external magnetic field .",
    "the expression for the partition function of atih chain results in @xmath163    using the eq .",
    "we are able to map the asymmetric tetrahedral spin-(@xmath164 ) ising - heisenberg chain , into an effective spin-1/2 ising chain . where the spin @xmath3 of heisenberg _ interaction edge _ could be 1/2 or 1 .",
    "another case that we consider will be the ising _",
    "interaction vertex _ with spin-1 .",
    "thus the asymmetric tetrahedral spin(1,s ) ising - heisenberg chain , will be mapped into an effective spin-1 chain .",
    "similar to the previous case we obtain the following boltzmann weight expressed as follow @xmath165where @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath162 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 are the parameter to be determined .    the new parameters of eq",
    ". can be expressed using the associated boltzmann weight , which is written as @xmath170 similar to the previous case @xmath152 means just a constant in the new effective hamiltonian , while @xmath166 being the coupling parameter , whereas b corresponds to the external magnetic field , the parameter @xmath168 represents the single - ion anisotropy , whereas @xmath169 correspond to the interaction of quadratic and linear interaction among the nearest spin and finally @xmath167 are the parameter of the biquadratic interaction .    in this case",
    "if we consider a null magnetic field , we have @xmath171 and @xmath172 . under this condition the eqs .",
    "and eq . leads to @xmath173 and @xmath174 , respectively , then the boltzmann weight function @xmath148 defined by eq . , reduce the following relation@xmath175 finally we have concluded that , our mapping of the asymmetric tetrahedral spin-(1,s ) ising - heisenberg chain can be expressed as an effective spin-1 ising chain .",
    "where as before the spin @xmath3 of heisenberg _ interaction edge _ could be 1/2 or 1 .",
    "we can notice that the partition function of the atih chain obtained above , by mapping into ising spin chain is limited .",
    "we can not obtain directly the correlation function because the mapped ising chain does not depend of the decorated spin .",
    "then we can use the method presented by fisher@xcite , where the correlation function for the atih chain can be obtain using the decoration transformation in a similar way as was performed the partition function , assuming we known the correlation function of the effective spin-1 ising chain .    using the definition given in reference @xcite , we have@xmath176here @xmath177 represents the decorated spin at site @xmath178 , and @xmath179 are any spins of the systems along the chain , it could be either decorated spins @xmath3 or undecorated spins @xmath35 . with @xmath180 as the total partition function of the system and @xmath181 the total hamiltonian .",
    "it is possible to split the above relation in two parts , one of this being independent on the spin @xmath177 and the other one containing the @xmath177 dependence .",
    "thus we write down the total hamiltonian as @xmath182where the @xmath183  contains the dependence of the spins @xmath184 and @xmath185 contains only combinations of the spins @xmath186 . actually , in the case when @xmath187 = 0,$ ] we have @xmath188and as was pointed out by fisher@xcite , it is possible to prove that @xmath189 can be represented as @xmath190 we give some values for the correlation functions of the asymmetric tetrahedral ising - heisenberg model in the case when the ising _ interaction vertex _ with spins",
    "are equal to @xmath191 or @xmath192 and the decorated spin could be equal to @xmath133 or @xmath118 . in the case of spin @xmath191 , it is possible to obtain an equivalent form@xcite for the right hand side of ( [ co4 ] ) , @xmath193    as an example , let us apply to evaluate the following correlation , with arbitrary sites @xmath178 and @xmath194 , instead of performing only among next nearest sites@xcite , considering @xmath195 could be spin 1/2 or 1 , thus the correlation read as @xmath196 where the coefficients @xmath197 s can be obtained solving the system equation and , from where we verify their solution is given as a derivative of the parameters obtained in respect to magnetic field @xmath17 , which read as @xmath198 then it is possible to write as a combination of the correlation function of the effective ising chain with up to three - body spin correlations , this correlation is given explicitly as follow @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the correlation length of the effective(standard ) ising chain@xcite .    the auto correlation function of the @xmath201 when we consider the ising _",

    "alternatively we can obtain this kind of correlation using the direct transfer matrix formalism such as performed in reference @xcite , meanwhile the advantage of this method could be a non - iterative calculation .",
    "the phase diagrams of the asymmetric tetrahedral ising - heisenberg ( atih ) chain were studied for the case when the ising _",

    "( decorated ) spin is 1 , we have also obtained a rich phase diagram for the ground - state energy , even when an external magnetic field and the next nearest interaction are absent .",
    "these phase diagrams are shown in the figures 4 and 5 .",
    "the @xmath86 line appears to be the limit of the @xmath109 and the other states , so for the critical point ( @xmath138 ) the energy takes the value @xmath144 . some particular case of our results obtained have been compared with those obtained in reference @xcite .",
    "we have noticed that using a decorated ising model mapping transformation , initially given by fisher @xcite , the calculation of the partition function for the atih chain is reduced to a closed expression of ising spin chain .",
    "we have considered some particular cases to discuss the thermodynamic properties , such as ising _ interaction vertex _ with spin 1/2 and 1 , whereas the interaction edge could be xyz with spin-1/2 and xxz with spin-1 respectively .",
    "the results for correlation function are presented generally for the situation when we have the ising _",
    "interaction vertex _ with spin-@xmath133 or 1 and the heisenberg _ interaction edge _ with spins @xmath133 or @xmath118 .",
    "we have observed that some correlation function could be obtained using the derivative related to some parameter instead of using the decorated transformation used in reference@xcite , we also considered a long range correlation function where we used the decorated transformation to obtain the result .",
