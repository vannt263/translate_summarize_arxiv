    "the launch of the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) has led to the discovery of kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) in neutron star ( ns ) low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) @xcite .",
    "these high - frequency qpos usually appear in pairs ( upper @xmath5 and lower @xmath6 ) at frequencies from a few hundred hz to more than 1khz , as shown in atoll sources , z sources ( see @xcite for the definition of atoll and z sources ) and the accreting millisecond x - ray pulsars ( amxps ) ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it is suggested that khz qpos might be used to test the general relativity in a strong gravitational field regime @xcite , and help to constrain the ns @xmath7 relation @xcite .",
    "the frequencies of the khz qpos are strongly correlated with other timing and spectral features , such as the photon indexes of the power - law component of the energy spectrum @xcite , the noise features @xcite , the positions in the x - ray color - color diagram ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the x - ray luminosities @xcite , the low frequency qpos @xcite , where the high-/low - frequency correlation is similar to those in black hole candidates and white dwarf cataclysmic variables ( e.g. @xcite ) . besides , the quality factors and @xmath8 amplitudes of the khz qpos can vary as a function of the qpo frequencies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is currently no consensus as to the origin of these qpos . some interpretations , such as the beat frequency model by @xcite and the resonance model by @xcite , encounter difficulties when interpreting the following observational characteristics of the khz qpos @xcite .",
    "while the relativistic precession model @xcite fits the @xmath9 relation to the khz qpo data quite well .",
    "however , it requires the ns mass of 2 solar mass ( @xmath10 ) @xcite , which is relative higher than the actual measurement results @xcite .",
    "the alfvn wave oscillation model ( awom ) by @xcite makes a good description of the khz qpo data @xcite .",
    "the model predicts the relative emission positions of the khz qpos ( @xmath11 , the ratio between the ns radius and the khz qpo emission radius ) , which can help to infer the emission radii of khz qpos , then further infer the magnetosphere - accretion disk structure and evaluate the possibility of the khz qpo mechanism .",

    "+ we suggest that cir x-1 may have the large ns surface magnetic field @xmath120 , which will cause the large magnetosphere - disk radius , i.e. the large ones of the emission radii of khz qpos .",
    "it is not clear what physical parameters determine the appearance of the detectable khz qpos , nor why they only occur in the certain range of @xmath165 km away from the ns surface , and we suspect that it may be related to the accretion environment of lmxbs , which need the further study of the accretion state of the systems .",
    "2 .   xte j1807.4 - 294 , 4u 0614 + 09 , gx 5 - 1 and gx 340 + 0 show the larger range of the emission radii of khz qpos from @xmath158 17 km to @xmath158 30 km ( see table [ data_all ] and fig.[r_z ] ) , implying these sources may have the more suitable physical environment to produce khz qpos .",
    "less bright source xte j1807.4 - 294 ( @xmath166 km ) and 4u 0614 + 09 ( @xmath167 km ) have the similar large range of the emission radii with the more bright source gx 5 - 1 ( @xmath168 km ) and gx 340 + 0 ( @xmath169 km ) , which implies the emission condition of khz qpos may not sensitive to the mean accretion rate .",
    "it can be seen from see table [ data_all ] , table [ data_mass ] and fig.[r_atoll_z_msp ] that the emission radius @xmath122 of khz qpos for all the sources are larger than the ns radius @xmath121 ( @xmath170 km and @xmath121 is assumed to be 15 km , i.e. @xmath171 ) , which means that the accretion matter that is related to the khz qpos is at the position at least one kilometer away from the ns surface .",
    "there may be some interpretations for these phenomena : one is the effect of the local strong magnetic spot @xcite which expels the magnetosphere - disk not to approach the ns surface , so the accretion matter may at the position away from the ns surface .",
    "another explanation is that the accretion plasma drops onto the stellar surface due to the instability when crossing the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) of ns , and the isco radius ( @xmath172 ) is the inner boundary of the accretion matter , so the emission radius of the khz qpos should be larger than @xmath173 .",
    "we try to test the isco effect scenario : three sources in the sample , i.e. cyg x-2 , sax j1808.4 - 3658 and xte 1820 - 30 , have both the detected twin khz qpo frequencies and the measured ns masses ( see table [ data_mass ] ) , which can be used to calculate both the ns radii and isco radii with the following equations : +   + @xmath148 , + @xmath149 , + @xmath172 .",
    "+ the results are shown in table [ data_mass ] , i.e. for cyg x-2 , @xmath174 km and @xmath175 km , for sax j1808.4 - 3658 , @xmath176 km and @xmath177 km , for xte 1820 - 30 , @xmath178 km and @xmath179 km .",
    "it can be seen that the isco radii of the three sources are all smaller than their inferred ns radii , so we suggest that the isco effect may not be the main reason to cause the emission radii of the khz qpos larger than the ns radii .",
    "it can be seen from table [ data_all ] , table [ data_mass ] and fig.[r_atoll_z_msp ] that most atoll and z sources ( 19/23 ) are inferred to share the similar emission radii of khz qpos of @xmath0 km .",
    "we try to probe the ns magnitude field by the khz qpos : the luminosities of atoll sources are less than those of z sources in 2 - 3 magnitude orders in general , thus we assume that the accretion rates of atoll sources are about 2 magnitude orders lower than those of z sources in average .",
    "the magnetosphere - disk radius @xmath111 where the khz qpos occur satisfy the equation ( [ r_m_ns ] ) : + @xmath164 , + the similar @xmath180 km ) and the different @xmath118 will infer the ns surface magnetic field strengths of atoll sources are about one magnitude order less than those of z sources , which is consistent with the prediction of @xcite .",
    "source xte j1701 - 462 has been observed both atoll and z behaviors @xcite , which can go from one state to the other one in timescale of months , and @xcite suggest this source has a ns surface magnetic field strength should not change in that timescale .",
    "we argue that xte j1701 - 462 has a steady ns surface magnetic field and should not change in the short timescale , and ascribe the change of the atoll and z behaviors to the different magnetic field strengths at the different magnetosphere - disk radii : by assuming the ns magnetic field to be dipolar ( see equation ( [ ns_b ] ) ) : + @xmath181 , + when the source has a instantaneously high accretion rate , the accretion disk will go closer to the ns surface and shows a smaller @xmath111 , where the magnetic field there will be higher , then the source shows the z source behavior .",
    "on the contract , the system will show the atoll source behavior with the lower magnetic field at the magnetosphere - disk radius when it has a instantaneously low accretion rate .",
    "so we suggest that the atoll and z states of the source may reflect the magnetic field information at the different magnetosphere - disk radii .",
