    "in science , there are a considerable number of problems where fluctuations are present in all scales of length , varying from microscopic to macroscopic wavelengths . for instance",
    ", we can mention the problems of fully developed turbulent fluid flow , the growing of polymer chains , critical phenomena and elementary particle physics .",
    "the problem of non - classical reaction rates ( diffusion limited chemical reactions ) turns out also to be in this category .    as was pointed out by wilson@xcite :  in quantum field theory,elementary `` particles like electrons , photons , protons and neutrons turn out to have composite internal structure on all sizes scales down to zero . at least this is the prediction of quantum field theory '' .",
    "the most largely employed strategy for dealing with problems involving many length scales is the  renormalization - group ( rg ) approach \" .",
    "the rg has been applied to treat the critical behavior of a system undergoing second order phase transition and has been shown to be a powerful method to obtain their critical indexes@xcite .    in an alternative way to the rg approach ,",
    "c. j. thompson@xcite used a heuristic method ( of the dimensions ) as a means to obtaining the correlation length critical index ( @xmath8 ) , which governs the critical behavior of system in the neighborhood of its critical point .",
    "starting from landau - ginzburg - wilson hamiltonian or free energy , he got a closed form relation for @xmath9 @xcite , where d is the spatial dimension .",
    "it is argued that the critical behavior of this @xmath10-field theory is within the same class of universality as that of the ising model .",
    "one of the present authors@xcite applied thompson s method to study diffusion limited chemical reaction @xmath11 ( inert product ) .",
    "the results obtained in that work@xcite agree with the exact results of peliti@xcite who renormalized term by term given by the interaction diagramms in the perturbation theory .",
    "more recently , nassif and silva@xcite proposed an action to describe diffusion limited chemical reactions belonging to various classes of universality .",
    "this action was treated through thompson s approach and could encompass the cases of reactions like @xmath12 and @xmath11 within the same formalism . just at the upper critical dimensions of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath14 ) reactions , the present authors found universal logarithmic corrections for the mean field behavior .",
    "thompson s renormalisation group method has been applied to obtain the correlation length critical exponent of the random field ising model by aharony , imry and ma@xcite and by one of the present authors@xcite .",
    "his method was also used to evaluate the correlation length critical exponent of the n - vector model@xcite .",
    "yang - lee edge singularity critical exponents@xcite has been also studied by this method . in short",
    "we have been exploring the various possibilities of the thompson s method of dimensions@xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite   @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "as we can see , for instance , by considering these various possibilities of the method , we were able to obtain the universal logarithmic behavior for the coupling parameters of various models at their respective upper critical dimensions [ 4,6,8 - 16 ] .",
    "we also have shown how this method behaves when applied to @xmath15@xcite and we have obtained the logarithmic behavior on scale of energy for coupling @xmath16 ( for @xmath17 ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to describe firstly the qcd - vacuum behavior by considering a strong classical analogy of such vacuum with a paramagnetic material in the presence of an external magnetic field @xcite . to do that",
    ", we will use in section 3 a simple action in the form of that of landau , i.e.,without temperature and phase transition , where the magnetization due to the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath0 is thought as a color scalar field of virtual gluons .",
    "such cloud of virtual gluons are induced in vacuum because , in the investigation of the internal structure of the nucleons , higher energy scales must be also considered . by applying thompson s method ( t.m ) to such an action , it will be possible to extract an  effective electric permissivity \" @xmath4 , an  effective magnetic permeability \" @xmath3 and also an  effective susceptibility \" @xmath1 which depends on logarithmic of energy scale @xmath2 used to investigate the hadronic matter .",
    "just in order to obey lorentz invariance , we will make the simple lorentz condition for vacuum , that is , @xmath5 ( @xmath6)@xcite . our investigation provides an analogy between the energy of the qcd - vacuum and the corresponding energy of magnetic dipoles of a paramagnetic material being ligned up by the action of a magnetic field . due to this fact",
    ", we will verify in section 2 that qcd - vacuum at higher energies behaves as if it were predominantly a kind of  color paramagnetism \" for gluons with spin 1 , that is , the bosonic behavior of qcd - vacuum in such ",
    "paramagnetic regime ( @xmath3 ) \" for higher energies supplants completely the fermionic contribution for vacuum due to  diamagnetic regime ( @xmath18 ) \" , and thus we will get asymptotic freedom in qcd as a consequence of this antiscreening effect (  vacuum paramagnetism\")@xcite .    actually qcd - vacuum is more complex than qed - vacuum in the sense that the first one presents a kind of competition between the two contributions , namely a screening effect (  vacuum diamagnetism\",@xmath18 or  vacuum dielectricity\",@xmath19 ) and an antiscreening effect (  vacuum paramagnetism \" , @xmath3 ) , such that antiscreening supplants completely screening at higher energies ( asymptotic freedom ) . on the other hand ,",
    "qed - vacuum is more simple because it presents only the contribution for the screenig effect . in section 4 , taking in account these two contributions , we will get a unified vision for qcd and qed by obtaining a general @xmath7-function where both bosonic and fermionic contributions are considered together , such that we recover qed @xmath7-function for 1 loop as a special case when there is no gluon state ( @xmath20 ) and only one flavor ( @xmath21 ) , that is , we have the special case of just fermionic vacuum with its characteristic dielectric properties ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the modern theory of the strong interactions @xcite  @xcite is a non - abelian field theory . in 1973 ,",
    "gross and wilczek @xcite and independently politzer@xcite have shown that certain classes of non - abelian fields theories exhibit asymptotic freedom , a necessary condition for a theory that could describe strong interactions . these seminal papers@xcite  @xcite opened the route to the birth of qcd .    in a not very accurated picture ,",
    "qcd can be considered as an expanded version of qed . in qcd",
    "we have also six fermionic fields representing the various quark flavors , in contraposition to a single fermionic field of qed . besides the asymptotic freedom exhibited at the ultraviolet limit",
    ", a theory of the strong interactions must also display quark confinement at the infrared limit .    whereas in qed there is just one kind of charge , qcd has three kinds of charge , labeled by  color \" ( red , green and blue)@xcite .",
    "the color charges are conserved in all physical processes .",
    "there are also photon - like massless particles , called color gluons , that respond in appropriate ways to the presence of color charge .",
    "this mechanism has some similarity with the ways photons respond to electric charge in qed , excepted by the non - abelian character of the theory .",
    "let us write the qcd - lagrangian density , namely :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 , and @xmath25@xcite    in ( 1 ) above , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the mass and quantum field of the quark of @xmath28  flavor \" , and @xmath29 is the gluon field , being @xmath30 and @xmath8 the space - time indexes .",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are color indexes .",
    "the coefficients @xmath34 ( structure constants ) and @xmath35 guarantee @xmath36 color symmetry .",
    "@xmath37 is the coupling constant .",
    "the gluon part of ( 1 ) contains both a kinetic term , @xmath38 , and an interaction term @xmath39 .",
    "the form of the kinetic term is the same form as the photon term of the well - known qed - lagrangian .",
    "thus exchange of gluons gives rise to forces similar to the coulomb interaction , but acting on particles with color instead of charges .",
    "however , gluons carry color themselves ( unlike photons that do nt carry any charge ) , which leads to the interaction term ( @xmath40 ) between gluons themselves , and this is the situation that makes qcd an asymptotically free theory      it is well - known the energy stored in an electric field according to classical theory , mamely @xmath41 , being the integration performed in a @xmath42 space - like volume . in a previous paper ( see ref . [ 17 ] ) , where we have considered @xmath43 at high energies , quantum fluctuations due to vacuum polarization affect the energy through a squared quantum contribution in @xmath44 , since the linear quantum contribution term @xmath44 averages out to zero .",
    "so we have obtained @xmath45  @xcite , where the bars means averaging over a sufficiently long time in the scale of the fluctuations , and therefore we were interested in the quantum process namely the absorption and emission of virtual photons , leading to the quantum correction in the field @xmath46 , that is , @xmath47^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ]  @xcite , where the index @xmath48 means root mean square .",
    "we have thought that such a correction is different from zero only in the presence of the fermionic field due to its purely quantum origin .",
    "this led us to propose the relation @xmath49",
    "@xcite , where we have considered @xmath50\\right>_r=\\frac{1}{2\\pi^2 r^3}$ ] ( see 11 in ref .",
    "@xmath51 corresponds to the mean squared fermionic field in the variable of scale-@xmath52 , and @xmath53 is a proportionality constant .",
    "such relations allowed us to obtain @xmath54 in qed for quantum contribution of the field @xcite",
    "@xcite  @xcite at high energy .",
    "it must be compared with the inverse square gauss law of the classical contribution and so we perceive that it leads to a logarithmic correction on scale @xmath52 for energy of the field@xcite  @xcite .",
    "as qcd introduces color charges and color fields since gluons carry color charges ( unlike photons that do nt carry any charge)@xcite , we could extend the reasoning above to treat qcd by considering a general  color electric field \" , namely :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the classical contribution for the color field with a  mode \" @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath57 is a fermionic contribution for the color field , which is similar to that of qed ( @xmath58^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ]  @xcite ) , however qed has no color .",
    "@xmath59 is a quantum contribution for the color field , which does not have any analogy with qed .",
    "it is due to quantum fluctuations of color fields in the presence of bosons ( gluons ) since they carry color themselves , that is , it is a bosonic contribution for the color field .",
    "we wiil see that such a new quantum contribution is exclusively from qcd - vacuum behavior , which leads to the antiscreening effect and thus makes qcd an asymptotically free theory .",
    "actually , relation ( 2 ) supplies a total energy density @xmath60 , being @xmath61 the classical contribution for energy density , @xmath62 and @xmath63 the fermionic and bosonic contributions respectively .",
    "we will see that @xmath63 has a changed signal with respect to @xmath62 , which leads to the antiscreening effect and the asymptotic freedom in qcd , in opposition to the screening effect of qed ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "now we assume that a heuristic approach used by thompson@xcite to study critical phenomena can be applied to the lagrangian ( 1 ) .",
    "the first prescription of thompson@xcite  @xcite is basically a scale argument with dimensional analysis for average values on scales .",
    "it states that :     when we consider the integral of the lagrangian ( 1 ) in a coherence volume @xmath65 in d - dimensions , the modulus of each integrated term of it is separately of the order of unity \" .",
    "this method by using its three prescriptions was firstly applied by thompson@xcite to the landau - ginzburg - wilson free energy or hamiltonian , obtaining critical exponents within the same universality class of the ising model . as the present model does not have any kind of phase transistion or spontaneous breakdown of symmetry , it is only necessary to use the first prescription of thompson .",
    "so by applying such prescription to the knetic fermionic term of lagrangian ( 1 ) , we write :    @xmath66_r dv_4\\right|\\sim 1,\\ ] ]    where @xmath67    we can observe that the dimension of '  @xmath68 `  ( @xmath69_r$ ] ) which appears in the integral ( 3 ) is the same as @xmath70_r = r^{-1}$ ] . this is because we are thinking only about a dimensional analysis in ( 3 ) for '  @xmath68 `  .",
    "so in such case we can naturally neglect the spinorial aspect of the field and just consider the '  first derivative @xmath71 `  , which defines the fermions ( quarks ) regarding to the scaling dimensional analysis , that is , @xmath70_r",
    "= r^{-1}$ ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the integral above leads immediately to a kind of scaling dimensional analysis , where the dimensional value of certain quantity @xmath72 $ ] inside the integral is taken out of its integrand as a mean value in a coherent hyper - volume of scale @xmath73 , being @xmath67 .",
    "thus from ( 3 ) we extract the following scaling behavior , namely :    @xmath74\\right>_r \\equiv [ \\overline{\\psi_j}\\psi_j]_r\\sim\\frac{1}{r^3}\\ ] ]    in analogous way to that heuristic reasoning used in qed by considering the fermionic contribution of condensate @xmath75 over quantum fluctuations of field @xmath46 , that is to say , @xmath76\\right>_r\\propto\\frac{1}{r^3}$ ]  @xcite , then , for qcd , we have a similar fermionic contribution from quark condensate which also contributes for quantum fluctuations of the color field @xmath77 through @xmath78 , namely :    @xmath79\\right>_r\\propto\\frac{1}{r^3}\\ ] ]      let us firstly recapitulate some properties of ordinary polarizable media in the classical theory . in a polarizable medium , the potential energy of two static test charges @xmath80 and",
    "@xmath81 is @xmath82 , where @xmath52 is the distance between the two charges , being @xmath83 the dieletric constant , which in vacuo takes the value @xmath84 .",
    "ordinarily , the polarizability of the medium causes a screening of the interaction between the test static charges , meaning that @xmath19 . on the other hand",
    ", antiscreening corresponds to @xmath4 .",
    "a relativistic quantum field theory has a vacuum which presents a strong classical analogy with the ordinary polarizable medium , however it just differs from an ordinary polarizable medium on a very important aspect : it is relativistically invariant .",
    "this means that , if we set the velocity of light @xmath85 , the magnetic permeability @xmath30 is related to the dieletric constant ( electric permissivity ) @xmath83 by    @xmath86    the implication of lorentz invariance in qcd is very important in theories on confinement of quarks and gluons@xcite .",
    "such a relationship ( 6 ) does not exist for an ordinary or classical polarizable medium .    in order to obey lorentz invariance given in ( 6 ) , we can conclude that ordinary screening means @xmath18 ( diamagnetism ) and ordinary antiscreening means @xmath3 ( analogous to paramagnetism of the landau s classical theory ) .",
    "the magnetic permeability @xmath30 is written in the following way : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "qcd - vacuum has classical analogy to the paramagnetic medium@xcite .",
    "we will see that the increasing of energy scale @xmath2 to investigate hadronic matter leads to increasing of  effective susceptibility \" of qcd - vacuum @xmath89 to be determined in the next section .",
    "this leads to an increasing of the  effective magnetic permeability \" of qcd - vacuum , namely @xmath90 .    by considering a paramagnetic medium with a volume @xmath91 and an uniform magnetization @xmath92 in the presence of the field @xmath0",
    ", thus we have the following energy :    @xmath93    where @xmath94 .    in spite of",
    "there is not lorentz invariance in ordinary media , a paramagnetic medium still realizes a strong classical analogy to qcd - vacuum in the sense that we could think that such a vacuum is a medium with spin effect of color charges@xcite associated to virtual gluons .",
    "gluon has a bosonic spin ( @xmath95 ) like photons , thus , in this case , a direct classical analogy to magnetization @xmath92 due to fermions ( @xmath96 ) leads us to think about a kind of  color magnetization @xmath97 \" for qcd - vacuum as being a  color paramagnetic medium \" in the presence of a  color magnetic field @xmath98 \" .",
    "following such an analogy to qcd - vacuum , we can write : @xmath99 where @xmath31 is just a color mode that we select for convenience , being @xmath100 the  effective paramagnetic susceptibility \" for qcd- vacuum , with dependence on the energy scale @xmath2 .    in ( 8) ,",
    "paramagnetism manifests itself through the minus sign in front of the right - hand side , which shows , in analogy to qcd - vacuum , that vacuum energy in qcd is decreased in the presence of a color magnetic field@xcite .",
    "so ( 8) can be written in the following way for representation of the  color paramagnetic energy \" of qcd - vacuum , namely :    @xmath101    where @xmath91 is a kind of coherence volume inside which color fields are greatly correlated , in analogy to correlated spin effect@xcite .",
    "the behavior of the increasing function @xmath100 will be shown in the next section .",
    "the interesting classical analogy between qcd - vacuum at a certain energy scale @xmath2 of investigation and a paramagnetic medium with magnetization @xmath92 in an external magnetic field @xmath0 motivates us to introduce an effective landau s hamiltonian for representation of vacuum inside the hadronic matter as a paramagnetic medium in the presence of a color magnetic field @xmath98 .",
    "this simple model will be presented in this section .",
    "it is well - known that a cloud of virtual gluons emerges in qcd - vacuum at higher energies @xmath2 , leading to the  color paramagnetism \" ( antiscreening),whereas , on the other hand , a cloud of virtual electron - positron appears in qed - vacuum at higher energies , leading to vacuum polarization .",
    "we have a  dielectric vacuum \" ( screening ) for qed .",
    "the cloud of virtual gluons of the qcd - vacuum are quanta of the color field induced by the probe used to investigate the structure of the hadronic matter and depends on its energy scale @xmath2 .",
    "but it depends also on the proper color magnetic field @xmath98 that already exists inside the hadronic matter under investigation .",
    "therefore , such a color field could be thought as being directly related to the color magnetization @xmath97 and also to the color magnetic field @xmath98 since we have the relation @xmath102 .",
    "so now let us think about such a color field as being a general scalar field @xmath103 , namely :    @xmath104=\\phi_a[\\chi(u),h_a(r)],\\ ] ]    where @xmath105 . as the effective susceptibility @xmath100 and the color magnetic field @xmath98 are independent parameters , let us use for convenience the scalar color field @xmath106 in the form @xmath107 $ ] . here",
    "we now think that the color magnetic field @xmath98 and color magnetization @xmath97 have dependence on @xmath52-coordinate inside the  color paramagnetic medium \" represented by the hadronic matter .",
    "due to the classical analogy to paramagnetism , let us introduce now the following  effective landau hamiltonian \" for  color paramagnetism \" , namely :    @xmath108 ^ 2 + r(l)\\phi_a(\\chi , h_a(r))^2 + k(l)\\phi_a(\\chi , h_a(r))^4~]dr,\\ ] ]    where , in this case , the coefficients @xmath109 and @xmath110 do not depend on temperature since there is not any phase transition in such effective model .",
    "the integration ( 12 ) extends over @xmath111-dimensional volume .",
    "thompson s approach has three assumptions ( see ref.[3 ] ) .",
    "as we are not interested in phase transition , we will use only the two first ones , namely :    \\(a ) when the integral in ( 12 ) is taken over the scale volume @xmath112 in @xmath111-dimensions , the three terms separately in ( 12 ) are all of order unity .",
    "\\(b ) in the specific case of ( 12 ) , we just have to consider the parameter @xmath110 to be finite in the limit @xmath113 .",
    "this leads us to consider a mean field regime above a certain critical dimension @xmath114 , where the coefficient @xmath115 remains contant . in landau",
    "s theory , @xmath13  ( ref.[3 ] ) .    by applying the assumption ( a ) in the first term of ( 12 ) , we write :    @xmath116    where the parameter @xmath117 forms the basis of our dimensional argument and may be thought as a wavelength cut - off , so that the mean value @xmath118 behaves as    @xmath119    for the second term in ( 12 ) we have    @xmath120    by introducing ( 14 ) into ( 15 ) , we obtain    @xmath121    for the third term in ( 12 ) we have    @xmath122    such that from ( 14 ) and assumption ( b ) we obtain from ( 17 ) @xmath123 from ( 18 ) , we observe that @xmath17 is a special dimension ( an upper critical dimension ) above which we have a mean field behavior@xcite , that is to say , the coupling parameter @xmath115 does not depend on scale @xmath117 , being a constant parameter .",
    "in other words , below @xmath17 , fluctuations are very important for the problem , deviating from mean field behavior , and above @xmath17,mean field \" description@xcite is a good description for the problem .",
    "so @xmath17 , which coincides with the space - time dimensions , corresponds exactly to a kind of border - line dimension to represent qcd - vacuum as a lorentz invariant theory and also its classical analogy with paramagnetic media .",
    "therefore , we must improve our approximations in order to  see \" the logarithmic dependence on scale @xmath117 ( ref.[17 ] ) of the coupling @xmath110 just in @xmath124 , or equivalently on the energy scale @xmath125 .",
    "similar situation has also occurred when we treated diffusion limited chemical reactions through thompson s",
    "approach@xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite , displaying universal logarithmic behavior on  upper critical dimensions \" for  coupling constants \" of those different models . following that improvement technique to ",
    "see \" such logarithmic behavior , let us improve the calculation of ( 17 ) by taking the quantity @xmath126 inside the integral ( 17 ) , firstly by starting from the same scale form as that evaluated in ( 14 ) , but now displaying a dependence on the @xmath52-variable of scale .",
    "so by taking inside the integral ( 17 ) the quantity @xmath127_r^4=([\\phi_a]_r^2)^2= r^{4 - 2d}$ ] and also the @xmath111-dimensional volume of integration in the form @xmath128 , we have    @xmath129    where , only for @xmath17 , exactly on the boder - line of mean field regime where @xmath115 is practically constant , we are able to see now the refinement of the logarithmic dependence on length scale for @xmath115 , that is , @xmath130 , which implies @xmath131^{-1}$ ] .",
    "so now , if we perform such integration between the limits of scales @xmath117 and @xmath132 , by considering here @xmath132 an upper cut - off of length , we write :    @xmath133    from where we obtain :    @xmath134    where the energy scales are @xmath135 and @xmath136 , being @xmath137 , since @xmath138 is a lower cut - off in the scale of energy , i.e.,it is a infrared limit .",
    "as we have obtained the logarithmic behavior of the coupling parameter @xmath115 just at @xmath124 for such a paramagnetic medium , we can do a direct analogy with @xmath139-vacuum by obtaining now the  color scalar field amplitude \" @xmath140 in a direct analogy to the equilibrium magnetization of the landau picture , namely @xmath141  ( ref.[3 ] ) .",
    "however , since we do not have any spontaneous breakdown of symmetry , we just consider the simple coefficient @xmath142 instead of @xmath143  ( ref.[3 ] ) .",
    "thus we simply obtain :    @xmath144    as we are interested only in the behavior of @xmath140 on the border - line at @xmath124 associated to our space - time , we introduce ( 21 ) into ( 22 ) and so we have :    @xmath145    where @xmath146 is a positive proportionality constant .",
    "we can associate the amplitude of scalar field @xmath147 to a negative energy density @xmath148 of a  color paramagnetic medium \" ( @xmath139-vacuum ) in analogy to that negative energy density of a paramagnetic medium , namely @xmath149 ( ref.[18 ] ) .",
    "however , we must consider an ",
    "effective susceptibility \" @xmath100 to represent qcd - vacuum and also a  color magnetic field \" @xmath150 .",
    "so such analogy leads us to write :    @xmath151    from where we can firstly extract @xmath152 and @xmath153 and so we can rewrite ( 24 ) as follows :    @xmath154    by comparing the right side of ( 25 ) with the right side of ( 24 ) , we can also extract the  effective susceptibility \" , as follows :    @xmath155    from ( 26 ) , it is interesting to observe that the effective susceptibility of @xmath139-vacuum increases logarithmicaly with energy scale @xmath2 .",
    "we can also observe that , from ( 21 ) and ( 26 ) , the parameter @xmath115 is @xmath156 , which allows us to interpret such parameter as being related to a  strength \" of coupling @xmath157 between quarks .",
    "so we have @xmath158 .",
    "that is because , when @xmath159 in infrared limit , this implies in @xmath160 ( very weak  paramagnetism \" ) , which leads to @xmath161 ( a much more strong coupling ) , that is , we have a highly confined regime of quarks in lower energies . on the other hand , when @xmath162 in ultraviolet regime , this implies @xmath163 (  color paramagnetism \" become much more evident ) , which leads to @xmath164 ( a very weak coupling between quarks ) , that is to say , we have the well - known asymptotic freedom for higher energies .    for sake of simplicity ,",
    "if we take the color magnetic field @xmath98 practically uniform in ( 25 ) , that is also to say , an uniform energy density @xmath165 or @xmath140 , and by considering a coherence volume @xmath91 , we simply obtain thecolor paramagnetic energy \" @xmath46 as that given in ( 10 ) , being @xmath166 now given in ( 26 ) .",
    "so we finally write :    @xmath167    the  effective magnetic permeability \" @xmath168 can be obtained by considering ( 26 ) , namely :    @xmath169    in order to obtain the  effective electric permissivity \" or the dieletric constant @xmath170 of qcd - vacuum , now we must guarantee the lorentz invariance by considering the relation ( 6 ) ( @xmath5 ) . so doing that and considering ( 28 ) , we find    @xmath171    being @xmath172",
    ". we have @xmath173 for @xmath174 .",
    "in qcd , we have an antiscreening such that the effective interaction between strong charges for higher energies is @xmath175 , with @xmath4 , that is @xmath176 . as the strong interaction is directly related to the strong coupling @xmath157 , we can also write it in the form : @xmath177 .",
    "so by considering ( 29 ) , finally we can also write it as follows :    @xmath178    where we fix @xmath179 to be a large value , but finite for lower energies .",
    "so ( 30 ) reveals to us the asymptotic freedom behavior for @xmath139 at higher energies because , if we fix @xmath138 and consider @xmath162 , the ratio @xmath180 , which means that the strong coupling decreases when the energy scale increases .",
    "however , actually , here only the bosonic contribution of gluons in qcd - vacuum was evaluated for dieletric constant . in reality",
    ", there is a competition between the effects of bosonic ( antiscreening ) and fermionic ( screening ) contributions , where the first one prevails .",
    "this subject will be treated in the next section .",
    "quantum fluctuations lead to an interaction energy ( @xmath181 ) as an increment in the field energy and with logarithmic behavior on length or energy scale , and we can represent both fermionic and bosonic contributions of energy density @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( see ( 2 ) ) in the following conpact form :      where @xmath183 is the total contribution of quantum fluctuations for energy density , such that there is certain superior cut - off wavelength @xmath184,below which ( @xmath185 ) we have quantum behavior of energy density @xmath183 on scale-@xmath52 , that is , @xmath186 ( see ref.[3 ] ) , and equal or above which ( @xmath187 ) we recover the well - known classical behavior of @xmath183 , that is , @xmath188 . to be more accurate , we rewrite a general form of @xmath183 in two regimes , namely :      where @xmath190 is a sharp cut - off wave - length . as the quantum regime also presents the bosonic contributions @xmath191 which leads to antiscreening in qcd , the mass @xmath192 must be considered as a dynamical variable which exhibits fluctuations depending on the energy scale .",
    "we are interested only in quantum regime for energy density @xmath193 of the field ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "so we want to obtain the interaction energy @xmath195 in a certain coherence volume @xmath91 .",
    "then let us think in a spherical volume @xmath91 and therefore we have the interaction energy in the differential form , namely :              where @xmath201 , and @xmath137 . due to fluctuations , it is natural to think that the coupling @xmath16 and the mass @xmath202 vary rapidly with the energy scale @xmath2 , such that we must take them off the integral ( 35 ) as avarage values on scale @xmath2 , namely :        on the other hand , it is important to perceive that the increment on mass @xmath205 due to interactions in such quantum regme is directly proportional to the increment on charge or coupling ( @xmath206 ) since both the increments present logarithmic behavior on scale .",
    "such reasoning was used before in @xmath43 ( see ref.[17 ] ) and so extending it to our problem , let us write :              the equations ( 36),(37 ) and ( 39 ) define the variable parameters @xmath214 , @xmath215 and @xmath213 . only the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath202 , @xmath206 and @xmath208 are always real quantities since they are physical parameters .      from the general result ( 40 )",
    ", we can observe that the sign of @xmath213 can change by controlling the predominance of antiscreening or screening . in the case of @xmath217",
    ", then we have @xmath218 for @xmath162 , which leads to the asymptotic freedom behavior of qcd connected to antiscreening . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath219 , we have the well - known landau singularity@xcite , namely a finite value of the energy scale @xmath220 such that @xmath221 .",
    "this case of increasing of @xmath16 with the increasing of @xmath2 is the behavior of qed- coupling @xmath16 associated to screening .",
    "such opposing case ( @xmath219 ) leads to an imaginary value for @xmath214 since @xmath16 must be a real and positive value ( see ( 39 ) )          in respect to sign of the term @xmath225 which appears in the right side of the differential equation ( 41 ) , we must interpret @xmath213 as being a general parameter that includes an effective result of a competition between fermionic and bosonic contributions , namely the final result of the competition between screening and antiscreening effect .",
    "so let us write :      where @xmath81 is simply a number to be determined by using boundary condition .",
    "@xmath227 is interpreted as a number of total bosonic species , contributing for antiscreening , namely a kind of total number of  normal modes \" for bosonic field to be defined .",
    "@xmath228 is a number of fermionic species , contributing for screening , which will be also defined .    at higher energy scales , whereas a cloud of virtual pairs of particle @xmath229 is induced in qed - vacuum as a dieletric meduim , similarly a cloud of virtual gluons @xmath230 is induced in qcd - vacuum as a paramagnetic medium@xcite .",
    "following now such semiclassical analogies , let us look for an alternative way to count @xmath227 and @xmath228 .    in qed",
    ", each pair @xmath231 plays the role of a electric dipole in  dieletric vacuum \" ( @xmath19 ) , which has only one flavor , namely @xmath232 , where @xmath233 represents fermion ( @xmath234 ) and @xmath235 represents anti - fermion ( @xmath236 ) . in general , as each quark flavor has spin degenerecency @xmath237 due to its fermionic property , so we count the total @xmath228 as being      where @xmath239 or simply @xmath240 represents an effective number of flavors @xmath233 .",
    "@xmath235 is already included into this counting because each pair @xmath241 forms one  flavor electric dipole \" .",
    "the multiplying factor @xmath242 comes from the degenerecency of spin @xmath243 for @xmath244 .    on the other hand ,",
    "a semiclassical anology between qcd - vacuum ( asymptotic freedom ) as spin effect@xcite due to virtual gluons which play the role of microscopic magnetic dipoles leads us to think @xmath227 as being      where , although each virtual pair @xmath246 emerges in qcd - vacuum , @xmath37 and @xmath247 are treated separately as being each one a magnetic dipole , that is , each virtual gluon in qcd - vacuum works effectively like a spin effect of a paramagnetic medium for this semiclassical analogy .",
    "@xmath248 is associated to a number of gluon states .",
    "here , the multiplying factor @xmath242 comes from the degenerescency due to two possible polarizations of gluon , which works like a photon in the sense that it is a massless particle .",
    "the differential equation ( 45 ) is an alternative way to get a unified vision between qcd and qed .",
    "it must coincide with the special case of qed-@xmath7 function when both of numbers @xmath250 ( no gluon state ) and also the number @xmath232 , which means only one flavor . so doing that and comparing the result with that well - known qed-@xmath7 function@xcite evaluated at one loop level , we have              it would be worth to make some comparison of the results of equation ( 47 ) with some experimental evaluation of the strong coupling as a function of momentum ( energy ) of the probe . in a plot of reference",
    "( 19 ) it is possible to get an estimate for @xmath254 , namely :                  on the other hand , if we consider @xmath261 as the number of quarks flavors , we obtain @xmath262 and @xmath263 mev .",
    "this value is close to quark constituent mass of the nucleon if we consider that each valence quark carries out one third of the nucleon mass .",
