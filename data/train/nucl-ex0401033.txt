    "a large body of studies , both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite , has demonstrated that intermediate energy heavy ion collisions proceed through a complicated reaction mechanism . for a wide range of impact parameters , ranging from peripheral to near central ,",
    "the mechanism is dominated by dissipative binary collisions , with early dynamical emission followed by statistical evaporation . in particular , at e / a @xmath1160 mev",
    ", the emission of light particles originates from ( at least ) three sources @xcite , a quasi - projectile source ( qp ) , a quasi - target source ( qt ) , and an intermediate velocity source ( is ) .",
    "the is accounts for dynamical emission , described by early nucleon - nucleon collisions and by other preequilibrium processes , such as emission from a low density neck region @xcite .",
    "since the particles emitted from these sources overlap in angle , energy and emission time , it is not possible , on a particle - by - particle basis , to identify which source each particle came from .",
    "a powerful experimental procedure to gain insight into the reaction mechanism is two - particle interferometry , used to determine the space - time extension of the particle emitting sources @xcite , and to extract the emission time sequence of neutrons , protons and their composites @xcite .",
    "our recent interferometry analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite on the 61 mev / nucleon @xmath3ar + @xmath4al reaction , has confirmed a dissipative binary reaction scenario with an important dynamical emission component from the is created in the overlap zone . in particular , an angular dependence of the correlation function",
    "has emerged .",
    "the stronger @xmath12 correlation observed at backward angles , indicates emission from a shorter lived source .",
    "this has been interpreted as an enhancement of the early dynamical emission component seen at backward angles .",
    "the average emission time of deuterons from this source has been found to fall in - between those of neutrons and protons , as expected if deuterons are formed mainly by coalescence @xcite .    to complete and complement the interferometry analysis , the information contained in the single - particle energy spectra",
    "is explored in this paper . in particular , we investigate the structure of light particle emission sources as it follows from the kinematic features of the single - particle ( _ p , d , t _ ) energy spectra . a common approach to study single - particle energy spectra ,",
    "is to fit the data to a moving source parameterization , using multiple sources to describe preequilibrium and evaporation sources .",
    "contribution from three sources is normally assumed : a qp , an is and a qt @xcite .",
    "while such a phenomenological approach can give a reasonably good description of double differential particle cross sections , the dynamics of the nuclear interaction and the mechanism of particle production remains hidden in the large number of fitted parameters .",
    "this description is further complicated by the fact that the three - sources relative yields vary with impact parameter , so that the parameters utilized in the description only represent average values . in this paper",
    "we investigate an alternative approach to the fitting procedure with three moving sources .",

    "the basic assumptions of the firestreak model are reviewed in appendix a. this model uses a quite drastic approximation of the geometry and treats the overlap region of the target and projectile as created in a totally inelastic process . yet , a reasonably good description of the angular and energy distributions of the protons is achieved .",
    "it should be stressed that only one parameter - the maximum source temperature , @xmath39=13.2 mev is introduced .",
    "the quite good agreement with the experimental data shows that the nature of the binary dissipative collisions is closely related to the participant - spectator picture of the interaction ( see also sec .",
    "[ sec : beta - tcm ] ) .",
    "the simplest way to describe the particle spectra is to adopt the participant - spectator description and assume emission from three thermal moving sources . for each emitting source ,",

    "\\1 ) a main feature is that , in the intermediate region of @xmath8 , there is a clear spreading of values of @xmath7 .",
    "this is due to the contribution from different sources ( qt , qp and is ) and to the broad impact parameter range of our apparatus , leading to a continuum of source velocities , covering the region 0.07 @xmath420.22 ( common to all charged particles ) .",
    "this is in accordance with the expected trends for a dissipative binary collision of heavy ions .",
    "the observed continuum of emission sources is quite naturally reproduced in the nuclear firestreak model description discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectra ] and in appendix a ( fig .  [ firestreak ] ) .",
    "\\2 ) one can identify a limiting region at high @xmath8 , where the source velocity converges towards the value @xmath43  0.21 .",
    "this indicates that the particles emitted at different angles , with the highest kinetic energy , originate from a source ( is ) with a well defined velocity .",
    "\\3 ) another limiting region can be identified at low @xmath8 and backward angles . here",
    "the different lines tend to converge towards the qt velocity .",
    "these low kinetic energy particles may be identified as emitted by the qt source ( compare with fig .",
    "[ tano ] ) .",

    "this `` bump '' indicates that particles with a quite low kinetic energy are emitted by a source with a high velocity .",
    "these particles may be identified as emitted by the qp source ( compare with fig .",
    "[ tano ] ) .",
    "this region is not completely explored by our experimental apparatus , due to the limited coverage at forward angles .",
    "notice that the qp `` bump '' disappears if the source identification plot is constructed for particles detected in coincidence with 4 or more fragments in the fw , a condition that biases the collected events towards less peripheral collisions .",
    "\\5 ) the _ p , d , t _ particles are emitted by common sources ( i.e.  the corresponding points lie on the same line in the plot ) .",
    "this is a key point that justifies the application of the coalescence mechanism of _ d _ and _ t _ production ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : coalescence ] ) and , maybe , a unique lifetime for their emission .",
    "the source characterization from the @xmath44 study , can be compared with the interferometry analysis carried out in ref .",
    "there it was found that the correlation strength of @xmath12 pairs measured in the `` forward '' angular region ( 54@xmath21/30@xmath21 ) is smaller than the correlation strength measured backwards .",
    "this indicates a larger space - time dimension of the effective source that emits protons in the forward direction .",
    "this is in agreement with the @xmath44 result that detectors at `` forward '' angles , 54@xmath21/30@xmath21 , register particles originating from a superposition of two sources , the is and the qp source @xcite .",
    "the qp decay reveals itself as the `` bump '' at @xmath45 25 mev / nucleon .",
    "in contrast , an effective source of smaller space - time size was deduced from the stronger @xmath12 correlation function measured at backward angles @xcite .",
    "this result seems to be in contrast with the source identification plot in fig .",
    "[ beta - tcm ] , where at backward angles ( 78@xmath21/102@xmath21 ) a qt can be identified at low @xmath8 energies .",
    "however , one should notice that in the correlation function , the yield from the different sources ( an information not seen in the @xmath44 plot ) plays an important role .",
    "since the measured yield from the qt source is low , the dominating contribution to the correlation function actually comes from the region of high @xmath8 energies in the source identification plot , dominated by the is",
    ".    finally , also the results of the @xmath12 correlation functions with a high total momentum cut ( @xmath46 450 mev / c ) are in agreement with the information derived from the @xmath7@xmath8 plot . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that the high total momentum gated @xmath12 correlation functions are enhanced and similar in size at backward and forward angles , indicating emission from an is of small space - time dimension .",
    "the @xmath12 correlation function measured forward is more substantially enhanced .",
    "this is because the momentum gate at forward angles effectively corresponds to suppressing the contribution from the qp source , leaving the is at high @xmath8 ( high @xmath47 ) as the dominating source . at backward angles , on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of the high total momentum gate is only a small enhancement , since the contribution from the qt source was already small ( see discussion above ) .",
    "the common sources for _ d _ and _ t _ emission , fig .  [ beta - tcm ] , suggest their common origin , f.e .",
    ", through the coalescence mechanism .",

    "usually , it is taken as the geometrical reaction cross section . the choice of @xmath58 influences the extracted @xmath48 value .",
    "if chemical and thermal equilibrium are achieved in the `` hot zone '' volume @xcite , @xmath48 can be related to the volume @xmath59 within which the nucleons coalesce to form a composite particle , @xmath60 for the dissipative binary type of collisions studied here , charged particles are emitted mostly in preequilibrium processes ( with emission time @xmath24 50 fm / c @xcite ) .",
