    "it has been known for almost forty years that in standard one - dimensional disordered models all states are localized for any strength of disorder , and that there is no localization transition in such systems.@xcite formally this is expressed by the statement that the lyapunov exponent ( le ) , @xmath0 , defined as @xmath1where @xmath2 is the transmission coefficient through the system of length @xmath3 , is always positive.@xcite while it may seem that there is nothing more to be said about one - dimensional models , their localization properties have recently attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "this renewed interest has been concentrated in two areas .",
    "the first area includes studies of unusual models that demonstrate the presence of extended states .",
    "it was noted first in ref .   that introducing correlations in the statistical properties of random site energies in the anderson model , one can create extended states in the one - dimensional anderson model at certain values of energy .",
    "later on , the authors of ref .   showed that regions of extended states exist in 1d systems with long range correlations of the random potential .",
    "the authors of ref .   demonstrated that vanishing le can be obtained in an arbitrarily chosen spectral region by selecting a special form of the correlation function of the random potential .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this result was obtained in ref .   only in the second order of the weak disorder expansion .",
    "taking into account the next terms of the expansion makes le positive again.@xcite    the second area of research interest in the field of one - dimensional localization is focused upon scaling and statistical properties of finite size systems .",
    "the single parameter scaling put forward in ref .",
    "is a cornerstone of the current approach to the anderson localization , but its interpretation in the presence of non - self - averaging fluctuations of conductivity was the subject of long debate .",
    "eventually it was understood that the sps hypothesis in anderson localization means that the entire distribution function of conductivity ( or transmission ) , and not individual moments , must be parameterized by a single parameter.anderson,shapiro this distribution in one - dimensional systems has been intensively studied@xcite , and it was established that the bulk of the distribution for sufficiently long systems has a log - normal form .",
    "it was also understood starting with ref .",
    "that under certain circumstances the two parameters of the distribution , the average value of the finite size le , @xmath4 , which coincides with its limiting value , @xmath5 , and the variance , @xmath6 are related to each other in a universal way @xmath7this relation reduces two parameters of the distribution to only one , and provides , therefore , a justification and interpretation for sps . conditions , under which eq .",
    "( [ sps ] ) holds , however , have been established only recently , when the authors of ref",
    ".   showed that the validity of sps is controlled by a new macroscopic length , @xmath8 , defined in terms of the integral density of states , @xmath9 : @xmath10where @xmath11 is energy .",
    "it was shown that sps holds when @xmath12 , and fails in the opposite case .",
    "recently , the authors of the present paper showed that parameter @xmath13 plays a more important role than just establishing the criterion for sps .",
    "it was found that in the non - sps region the function @xmath14 defined in eq .",
    "( [ sps ] ) , and the similar dimensionless combination of the third moment with the length @xmath15 and the lyapunov exponent @xmath0 are functions of this single parameter.@xcite in the recent paper ref .  , higher moments of the distribution of the lyapunov exponent were calculated analytically for a quantum particle in a potential described by the gaussian delta - correlated random function .",
    "it was found that all moments of the distribution for this model can be expressed as functions of the localization length and the parameter @xmath16 , where @xmath17 characterizes the strength of the potential .",
    "for the gaussian white noise potential the parameter @xmath13 is also a function of @xmath18@xcite thus in the particular case of the gaussian white noise potential these two parameters are equivalent .    in the present paper , we combine the two discussed areas and focus upon correlation induced changes in the probability distribution function of the lyapunov exponent . in order to study this problem",
    ", we consider a tight - binding model with the random potential described by a zero - mean dichotomic process .",
    "this process is characterized by an exponential correlation function with a correlation radius , which is a free parameter of the model .",
    "there is no localization - delocalization transition in this model , and we are interested in effects of the correlation radius on scaling and statistical properties of conductance in the regime of strongly localized states .",
    "this model allows for an approximate analytical treatment in the spectral region , where the correlation radius becomes a dominant length . combining analytical and numerical calculations",
    "we show that the presence of this additional length significantly changes the transition between sps and non - sps regions , and that in the non - sps region it results in a new scaling behavior .",
    "we consider the tight binding model , described by the equation of motion @xmath19where @xmath20 describes the strength of the random potential .",
    "the potential randomly takes one of two values @xmath21 depending upon whether the dichotomic random variable @xmath22 is equal to @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "the assumed value remains constant within regions of random lengths ( segments ) , which are distributed according to the discrete analog of the poisson distribution .",
    "the average length of such regions is @xmath25where @xmath26 is the correlation radius defined by @xmath27the finite size le is defined through the norm of the transfer matrix : @xmath28where @xmath29 are transfer matrices which , in our case , are equal to either @xmath30 , or @xmath31 depending upon the value of @xmath22 , where @xmath32 are @xmath33    to consider the spectrum of this system let us note that an addition of a constant potential @xmath34 shifts a conduction band , @xmath35 , of the homogeneous tight - binding system with no on - site potential by the value of the potential : @xmath36 .",
    "correspondingly , the spectrum of the random system under consideration can be divided into three regions with the qualitatively different spectral and transport properties .",
    "one region , @xmath37 , corresponds to the common part of the conduction bands of homogeneous systems with the site potentials equal to either @xmath38 or @xmath39 .  in the second spectral region , consisting of energies @xmath40 and @xmath41 , extended states exist in a homogeneous system with the site potentials equal to @xmath39 or @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "finally the third region , @xmath42 corresponds to the energies , where extended states would not arise in homogeneous systems with either of the two possible values of the potential .",
    "obviously , no states can arise in this region also in the system with the random distribution of the potential .",
    "while all states in this model are localized , different spectral regions still have different transport properties .",
    "transport in the first region is characterized by multiple scattering of propagating modes , and the localization in this region results from the interference of the scattered waves .",
    "transport in the second region can be described as tunneling through states , arising within the segments of the system , where the potential produces potential wells between barriers formed by segments with the opposite value of the potential .",
    "if the average length of the barrier  regions is larger than the penetration length under the barrier , the transport is mostly determined by the under - barrier tunneling , and the interference effects related to phase changes of the wave functions inside potential wells become less important .",
    "we are mostly interested in this region , where correlations are expected to result in the most non - trivial effects .",
    "one could expect that the transport in this region can be described within the quasi - classical approximation , and we will show below that this is indeed the case .    in the context of our problem",
    ", this approximation means neglecting commutators between transfer matrices at different sites . introducing le in a homogeneous system with the potential @xmath43 according to @xmath44 , \\label{eq : le_pure_def}\\]]where @xmath45we can write a quasiclassical expression for le for eq .",

    "( [ eq : le_limit ] ) can be formally obtained in the following way .",
    "the relation between le and the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix allows us to write @xmath55where the transfer matrix @xmath56 consists of sequences of @xmath32 @xmath57powers @xmath58 of transfer matrices @xmath32 represent the lengths of the regions where the potential remains constant .",
    "the matrices @xmath32 can be diagonalized @xmath59 , where @xmath60thus , introducing @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and noting that for long enough samples the effect of matrices @xmath63 appearing at the end of the structure on le is negligible , we obtain that le can be found from eq .",
    "( [ eq : le_thru_tr ] ) with the transfer matrix replaced by @xmath64the last step in the procedure is to commute , for example , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , with the purpose of collecting all @xmath67 together . if one begins this rearrangement from the right side of eq .",
    "( eq : total_thru_s ) , each of such permutations produces two terms .",
    "one of them consists of the product of the partially ordered and the remaining non - ordered parts , while the second one contains commutators of @xmath65 and @xmath66 . repeating the procedure leads to the recurrent equation for the part of the transfer matrix containing only products of commuting diagonal matrices @xmath68 @xmath69where",
    "we have used the fact that @xmath70 , and introduced the commutator @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "notation @xmath72 stays for the product of all @xmath67 between sites @xmath23 , and @xmath73 : @xmath74 , where @xmath75 .",
    "retaining the first term only and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : le_thru_tr ] ) we arrive at eq .",
    "( [ eq : le_limit ] ) .",
    "( [ eq : self - consistent ] ) can be used to obtain a representation for the transfer matrix in terms of the polynomial in powers of the parameter @xmath53 , which enters the expression for commutators @xmath76 , and can be considered as a small parameter in the case of weak disorder .",
    "however , the resulting expression for the transfer matrix can not be interpreted as a weak disorder expansion for le .",
    "the reason for this is the fact that the power of @xmath53 is determined by the number of segments with different values of the potential , and the whole polynomial is actually an expansion in terms of the number of jumps  between @xmath20 and @xmath39 .",
    "for instance , the term with @xmath77 results from configurations with only one such jump , and there are only @xmath78 such configurations . in the limit @xmath79 they give zero correction to the le ( in addition to the exponentially small probability of such configurations ) .",
    "thus , we can see that for long enough samples only terms of the order of @xmath80 make a significant contribution to the le because the number of such terms is proportional to the binomial coefficient @xmath81 and , therefore they give a linear in @xmath78 contribution to the @xmath82 .",
    "the actual number of configurations contributing to le depends upon the average length of the segments with constant potential ; and the number of jumps , corresponding to the optimal configurations can be estimated as @xmath83 .",
    "it is clear , therefore , that corrections to the first term of eq .",
    "( eq : self - consistent ) decrease with increasing @xmath84 .",
    "we thus expect that the approximation should work when @xmath85 .",
    "it actually becomes exact in the limit of infinite @xmath26 and @xmath86pastur_figotin , largecoupling this can be understood from the following arguments .",
    "deviations from eq .",
    "( [ eq : le_final ] ) are caused by the interference of the scattered waves .",
    "but in the second spectral region such scattered waves have to tunnel through the barriers , where the magnitude of the scattered waves decreases and the interference is destroyed . obviously , the effectiveness of the destruction depends on the width of the potential barriers , and the rate of decay of the wave functions in them .",
    "these characteristics are determined by @xmath84 and the magnitude of the potential respectively .    in the spectral region , @xmath87 only @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : le_characteristics ] ) is different from zero , and we have for @xmath89 @xmath90this expression is obviously different from sps eq .",

    "( [ eq : sigma2 ] ) suggests that a new type of scaling appears .",
    "it can be conveniently described with the help of a new scaling function , @xmath93 , @xmath94the transition between the two scaling regimes is controlled by the parameter @xmath95 . if the correlation radius is so small that this parameter remains much less than unity for the entire second spectral region , the regular scaling behavior expressed by @xmath92 persists .",
    "the behavior expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : new_scaling ] ) occurs when @xmath95 is greater than unity for the entire region @xmath87 .",

    "this behavior can be approximately described as @xmath97for @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",

    "the numerical value of the correlation radius in these figures is such that @xmath104 for the entire @xmath87 spectral region .",
    "a comparison of numerical results and the approximation ( [ eq : le_limit ] ) is provided for both average le and its variance . for energies inside the first region",

    "( [ eq : le_limit ] ) and the numerical calculations becomes perfect .",
    "we also studied numerically the scaling properties of our model .",
    "let us recall that for systems without correlations sps is controlled by the ratio @xmath106 of two macroscopic lengths existing in the system . in the presence of the correlated disorder",
    "the situation is more complicated because a new length related to the correlation radius @xmath26 should be taken into account . in our model",
    "this length is @xmath107 the average length of regions with constant potential . if @xmath84 is the smallest length in the system , @xmath108 the presence of correlations does not affect the scaling properties .",

    "the destruction of scaling in this case may also be illustrated by the behavior of @xmath123 for different values of @xmath84 .",
