    "with the aim of validating predictions from computer simulations against real - world experiments , it becomes necessary to include uncertainties ( descrbied as random quantities ) within the associated physical model .",
    "uncertainties of this kind , known as aleatoric uncertainties , mainly arise because mathematical models are often idealized approximations of their target scenarios ( in terms of geometry , material properties and boundary constraints ) , and due to limited knowledge in defining parameters of the physical systems being investigated .",
    "uncertainty quantification ( uq ) tools , have therefore , become key requirements for estimating the credibility and confidence of predictions from computer simulations . in particular , addressing the computationally demanding task of uncertainty propagation , has gained tremendous prominence amongst simulation engineers , supported by the rapid growth in computing power and advances in numerical analysis .    to this end , monte - carlo ( mc ) based methods [ , ] , wherein the corresponding ouput samples for a set of random input samples can be collected via repeated simulation runs , provide the most straightforward approach . however , when dealing with costly pde solvers , computing an ensemble of output realizations large enough to evaluate accurate statistics can be prohibitively expensive . alternatively ,",
    "cheaper surrogate models , can be trained on a much smaller ensemble of solution samples , using various sparse regression techniques [ , ] , and subsequently sampled exhaustively to approximate solution distributions and/or statistics . however , in the context of multi - physics problems , or coupled pde systems in general , these methods ignore the rich and potentially exploitable structures within the model .    several coupled pde systems , for example , fluid - structure [ ] and reactive - transport models [ ] ,",
    "are natural targets for employing modular ( partitioned ) solution methods wherein , solvers can be rapidly developed by reusing legacy solvers for each constituent subproblem .",
    "the disadvantage however , is that the convergence rate of modular methods , can be much slower when compared to monolithic methods , for example , the quadratically convergent newton s method [ ] .",
    "therefore , in the context of coupled pde solvers , modularization typically results in a trade - off between the developmental and computational costs , of which the former usually dominates .",
    "however , in extending the standard practices of modularization towards uncertainty propagation , several challenges yet remain .    in this work ,",
    "we propose an efficient non - intrusive method for generalized polynomial chaos ( gpc ) [ ] based uncertainty propagation in coupled pde solvers , which mitigates the curse of dimensionality associated with spectral uncertainty propagation methods .",
    "this is achieved by constructing reduced dimensional ( and order ) approximations of the input data are before they enter their respective solver modules .",
    "correspondingly , reduced approximations of the respective output data are obtained using optimal quadrature rules , which consequently reduce the required number of repeated module runs significantly .",
    "simple linear algebraic tools are used in constructing the reduced approximations and quadrature rules .",
    "moreover , the approximation errors can be controlled separately in each module .",
    "while several recent works have demonstrated the possibility of exploiting relatively trivial coupling structures , for example , unidirectional coupling [ ] , and linear coupling [ , , ] , to reduce the costs of uncertainty propagation , we consider a more general setup with bidirectional and nonlinear coupling structures in this work .",
    "our proposed method is a generalization of the approach recently proposed by constantine et .",
    "al [ ] , which applies well to network ( weakly ) coupled multi - physics systems . moreover ,",
    "several components of our proposed algorithm have also been motivated by the recent works of arnst et .",
    "[ , ] , wherein reduced chaos expansions [ ] are used in approximating the input data .",
    "however , in their approach , the dimension reduction procedure can only be implemented unidirectionally , and therefore , the computational gains achieved would be limited to those respective modules only .",
    "we address this limitation in our proposed method and facilitate the reduction strategy to be implemented across all the modules .",
    "furthermore , the respective tolerances , which control the error in the reduced approximations , can be prescribed individually for each module .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in ,",
    "we provide an overview of the preliminary definitions and concepts , along with a description of the standard non - intrusive spectral projection ( nisp ) method for solving stochastic algebraic systems . in , we describe the proposed reduced nisp method and its constituent dimension and order reduction steps .",
    "moreover , we prove the existence of asymptotic upper bounds on the approximation errors incurred by our proposed method . in , we report and compare the performance and accuracy of the standard and reduced nisp method implementations on two numerical examples .",
    "without loss of generality , we focus our analysis on a two component , steady - state coupled pde system .",
    "first , we consider the deterministic case .",
    "a spatial discretization of the system yields the coupled algebraic system : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 denote the discrete component residuals and @xmath3 , @xmath4 denote the respective finite - dimensional discretizations of the solution fields intrinsic in each component pde system .",
    "there are various approaches to solve numerically .",
    "monolithic solution methods , for example , newton s method , would require repeatedly solving the fully - coupled linear system @xmath5\\left[\\begin{array}{c } \\boldsymbol{u}_{1}^{\\ell+1}-\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}^{\\ell}\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\boldsymbol{u}_{2}^{\\ell+1}-\\boldsymbol{u}_{2}^{\\ell } \\end{array}\\right]=-\\left[\\begin{array}{c } \\boldsymbol{f}_{1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}^{\\ell};\\boldsymbol{u}_{2}^{\\ell}\\right)\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\boldsymbol{f}_{2}\\left(\\boldsymbol{u}_{2}^{\\ell};\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}^{\\ell}\\right ) \\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ] to compute the solution updates . in general",
    ", developing a solver for this linear system from scratch is quite challenging . moreover , if legacy solvers for each subproblem : @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are available , extensive modifications to their respective source codes would be required to construct the jacobian in .",
    "furthermore , the quadratic convergence rate of newton s method is not always guaranteed in practice .",
    "these limitations can be primarily attributed to the bidirectional nature of the coupled pde system and the influence of the off - diagonal blocks @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the linear system .",
    "variants of newton s method such as broyden s method [ ] , gauss - newton [ ] and levenberg - marquardt [ ] , would also be affected by these limitations , if implemented in this monolithic fashion .",
    "therefore , modular approaches , for example , block - gauss - seidel ( bgs ) [ ] , can overcome some of these limitations of monolithic methods , and are often preferred in practice .",
    "the primary advantage of modularization is that legacy solvers with disparate discretization and solution techniques can be easily coupled with minimal modifications to their source codes . in general ,",
    "the bgs method is an iterative method which can be represented as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the computational modules .",
    "individually , these modules can also be used to solve @xmath6 , given @xmath4 and @xmath7 , given @xmath3 respectively .",
    "we now consider the case where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are each dependent on a set of random input parameters , denoted as @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",

    "moreover , the indexing in the polynomial series is assumed to follow a total degree ordering , such that @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 denotes the total degree of @xmath46 .",
    "consequently , a gpc [ ] approximation @xmath47 , @xmath48 with order @xmath49 and @xmath50 gpc coefficients can be formulated as a finite truncation of , where @xmath51\\in\\mathbb{r}^{n_{i}\\times\\left(p+1\\right)}$ ] denotes the gpc coefficient matrix and @xmath52^{\\mathbf{t}}:\\xi\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}^{p+1}$ ] denotes the basis vector . if the truncation is isotropic and based on the total degree , then @xmath53 and @xmath54 are related as follows .",
    "@xmath55    the orthonormality of the elements in @xmath56 yields the spectral projection formula @xmath57    moreover , the cameron - martin theorem [ ] states that if @xmath32 is infinitely regular in @xmath36 , then as @xmath58 , the gpc approximation @xmath59 converges exponentially to @xmath32 , in the mean - square sense .",
    "to state this formally , @xmath60 , such that @xmath61 , @xmath62 for some @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , a corollary to the theorem states that if the regularity of @xmath32 is @xmath64 , then the asymptotic rate of convergence is polynomial and the upper bound in the mean - square error would be @xmath65 .    when compared to repeated executions of a costly numerical pde solver , the gpc approximation @xmath59 can be used as a significantly cheaper surrogate model for computing statistical quantities of interest such as the moments and probability density functions of @xmath32 via exhaustive sampling .",
    "in particular , approximations of the first two moments can be computed directly from the gpc coefficients as follows .",
    "@xmath66    moreover , the probability density function of any related quantity of interest can be computed with the kernel density estimation ( kde ) method [ ] , by generating a large number of samples of the cheaper polynomial surrogates .",
    "therefore , prior to any uncertainty analysis , the gpc coefficient matrices of the solutions must be computed via uncertainty propagation . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the non - intrusive projection method [ ] , which enables the reuse of the solver components @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "non - intrusive spectral projection ( nisp ) , is a method to approximate the gpc coefficients by approximating the integration in the spectral projection formula in using a quadrature rule in in @xmath36 , denoted as @xmath69 .",

    "a reduced nisp based method for uncertainty propagation in stochastic multi - physics models is presented , demonstrated and compared against the standard nisp method using two numerical examples . at the expense of a small approximation error , the reduced nisp method exhibits signifcantly high speedup factors over the standard nisp method .",
    "this is primarily due to the much slower growth in the number of repeated runs of each solver component in the former approach , which in turn can be attributed to the dimension and order reduction steps for constructing an approximation of their respective input data .",
    "therefore , the curse of dimensionality , which is the primary bottleneck for any spectral method in tackling large multi - physics models with several independent stochastic components , is demonstrably mitigated with the reduced nisp approach .    in the intermediate dimension reduction step ,",
    "since the gpc coefficients of the local variables are included in the matrix for which the svd is computed , we the local stochastic dimension in each module would serve as a lower bound for the respective reduced dimension .",
    "this suggests that the modular structure of the stochastic solver enables our proposed reduction strategy , which would fail to provide a reduced approximation if implemented with a fully - coupled ( monolithic ) nisp solver .",
    "the lower bound on the reduced dimension can also be observed in the numerical experiments .",
    "the two most significant overheads observed while implementing the reduced nisp algorithm were the computation of the vandermonde matrix for the construction of the reduced quadrature rule , and the computation of the global gpc coefficient matrices from the reduced gpc coefficient matrices .",
    "both these overheads can be easily eliminated due to the embarrassingly parallel nature of the computations involved . moreover , in each numerical example , both the nisp algorithms were implemented using a sparse grid global quadrature rule . if a full tensor grid were used , the computational gains observed in the reduced nisp method implementation would be much higher .",
    "furthermore , alternatives , for example , schur complement based elimination , to the bgs partitioning approach can be explored for reducing the overall computational costs .",
    "the applicability of our proposed algorithm is limited to models in which the global stochastic dimension is manageably low ( @xmath325 ) , since the global gpc coefficients still need to be computed , stored and operated on .",
    "if the global stochastic dimension becomes prohibitively large due to a particular module contributing a large number of independent uncertainties , a monte - carlo based sampling approach can be employed in that module , while other modules could still afford the use of spectral methods .",
    "such a framework has been recently demonstrated in [ ] , and further explorations to develop a more general approach are currently underway .",
    "moreover , for tackling models in which the solution regularity is low , the proposed method can also be easily adapted towards multi - element gpc [ ] and discontinuous wavelet [ ] based spectral representations .",
    "extending the framework of dimension and order reduction to intrusive spectral projection ( isp)- based uncertainty propagation would be particularly important in mitigating the overall intrusiveness and therefore , development costs incurred by the solver modules .",
    "moreover , derivative or active - subspace based dimension reduction methods [ ] have provided potential alternative approaches which are not yet fully explored .",
