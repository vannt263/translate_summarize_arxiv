    "in ecology , studies on the movement of animals provide many insights on the ecological features that explain population - level dynamics .",
    "these analyses are crucial to wildlife managers to understand complex animal behaviors @xcite . in fisheries science , understanding the underlying patterns responsible for spatial use of the ocean is a key aspect of a sustainable management @xcite .",
    "both fields promote now large programs to deploy global positionning system ( gps ) device .",
    "for instance we might mention , among others , the tagging of pelagic predators program ( topp ) or the torsooi program for marine animals and the wolf gps or elephant without borders programs for terrestrial wildlife . in the european union , since the 1st of january 2012 , the fishing vessels above 12 m are mandatory equipped with a vessel monitoring system which has become a standard tool of fisheries monitoring and control worldwide . as a result",
    "such programs produce large amount of trajectory data .",
    "these data sets have been largely used to understand , explain and potentially predict animals / vessels movements .",
    "those tasks require modeling and analysis of the gps tracks data but may have different objectives .",
    "a first objective is to segment the whole trajectory in homogeneous regions which are to be linked with behavioural activities .",
    "this is classically addressed using hidden markov models @xcite or change point detection approaches @xcite .",
    "a second objective is the construction / definition of a land / space use map , defined as utilization distribution ( ud ) of the individual , using gps data .",
    "two main approaches are used to build these ud maps .",
    "first , nonparametric kernel methods usually require assumptions such as independent data that depend strongly on the sampling scheme of the data ( although these assumptions have been relaxed to account for autocorrelation in some recent works @xcite ) .",
    "another approach , based on brownian bridge techniques , assumes that the trajectory is a brownian motion and then builds the ud by integrating the probability of presence over time .",
    "these two approaches rely on unrealistic assumptions regarding the movement dynamics . in this paper",
    ", it is assumed that observed trajectories of an individual are direct consequences of the environment attractiveness , hereafter called potential .",
    "we develop a method based on continuous time and continuous space stochastic modeling to estimate potential maps .",
    "the random process of interest @xmath0 describes the position of an individual continuously in time and space but discretely observed .",
    "this process is assumed to be a solution to a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) which depends on the environment potential .",
    "this statistical framework allows to ( a ) estimate the parameters of the sde and ( b ) sample trajectories of individuals to predict future behaviors .",
    "the use of a special form of sde to model animal movement have been studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these papers focus on the mean - reverting ornstein - uhlenbeck process and its extensions .",
    "the ornstein ulhenbeck process has a known distribution that facilitates parameters estimation .",
    "however , it is a quite restrictive class of model , and its extensions make the estimation framework more complex . @xcite and @xcite consider the special case where the drift of the sde is the gradient of a potential function which is a weighted sum of different sources that define attractive ( resp .",
    "repulsive ) regions where the individuals are likely ( resp .",
    "unlikely ) to move . as the solution to the corresponding sde",
    "does not have an explicit density , the drift function is estimated by applying an euler scheme to interpolate trajectories between two consecutive observations .",
    "this introduces an intrinsic bias in the estimation procedure , and might not be well suited for tracking data that can be sparsely sampled .    in this paper , a sde based on a potential function",
    "is proposed to model the position of an individual at each time step @xmath1 .",
    "the drift of the sde is a mixture of gaussian shaped functions , with unknown weights , centers and shapes , which represent the attractive regions where the species / fishing vessels are likely to travel .",
    "the aim of this paper is to find the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) for these attractive regions using gps data .",
    "although the sde has no explicit solution , considering @xmath2 independent animal / vessel trips @xmath3 , a trip @xmath4 being a sequence of observations @xmath5 sampled at times @xmath6 , the parameters of the sde ( weights , centers and shapes of the attractive regions ) can be estimated using an expectation maximization ( em ) based algorithm .",
    "the e step is approximated by monte carlo methods , using the exact algorithms introduced in @xcite and @xcite for an exact sampling of the sde .",
    "the m step is performed using the gradient free cmaes approach described in @xcite . as this proposed method",
    "does not rely on a discrete scheme to approximate the true process , the estimation error of the mle only depends on the quality of the monte carlo approximation of the @xmath7 step .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , the target sde is introduced and the em procedure based on independent trips to estimate the parameters is displayed in section  [ sec : em ] .",
    "performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed in section  [ sec : simdata ] with simulated data and in section  [ sec : realdata ] using a real data set . technical results to apply the ea algorithm of @xcite are postponed to appendix  [ sec : exactsim ] and [ sec : boundsforea ] .",
    "the goal of this paper is to propose a model which allows to identify regions of high attractiveness for an individual using gps tagging .",
    "those regions may then be ecologically interpreted and understood as feeding zones for different animals or high concentration of commercially interesting fishes for fishing vessels .",
    "the movement is modeled using a sde on @xmath8 .",
    "the drift is the gradient of a potential map which value at location @xmath9 represents the attractiveness .",
    "the diffusion term is assumed to be a constant scalar matrix .",
    "this apparently quite restrictive assumption is motivated by technical reasons but seems also quite reasonable due to a lack of biological information on the stochastic part of the movement .",
    "formally , the model is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath10 be a probability space and let @xmath11 be the set of continuous maps from @xmath12 $ ] ( @xmath13 is a fixed time horizon ) to @xmath8 , called the wiener space , endowed with the usual @xmath14-algebra @xmath15 generated by cylinders . in the following ,",
    "we consider the unique measure @xmath16 on the wiener space such that the coordinate process @xmath17 is a standard brownian motion and the natural filtration @xmath18 .",
    "each observed trajectory @xmath19 is a realization of the position process @xmath20 which is assumed to be a solution to the following homogeneous sde : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the diffusion coefficient and the drift function @xmath23 is defined as follows  : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is given , for all @xmath26 , by @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is a positive - definite matrix .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 contains all the unknown quantities we wish to estimate : @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 and we will discuss either @xmath34 has to be estimated or not .",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath29 and @xmath36 are respectively location , shape and weight parameters of the @xmath37-th attractive zone .",
    "the number of attractive zones @xmath38 is first assumed to be known .",
    "therefore , for all @xmath26 , @xmath39 since @xmath23 is lipschitz and @xmath34 is constant , the solution to this sde exists and is unique .",
    "figure [ fig : illustrationmodel ] shows one possible example of map of space use , the gradient of which defining the drift @xmath40 of the proposed sde .",
    "the model therefore captures the idea of attractive zones we aim at identifying .",
    "the parametric form of provides a smooth and flexible framework to describe different potential maps .",
    "the potential map is chosen positive ( but could be chosen negative ) , but has no constraint to integrate to 1 .",
    "for these reasons , the map is not a probability distribution .",
    "however , as the potential is supposed to be bounded , it might be understood as a measure of attractiveness .",
    "the assumption on the diffusion parameter is quite strong . in a more general context",
    "we could have defined the diffusion term as a matrix @xmath41 but we would need to ensure that the proposed model is such that the function @xmath42 is conservative , i.e. such that there exists    @xmath43    in the model described by and , the mapping @xmath44 is conservative with @xmath45 this conservative property is crucial to apply the exact algorithm 1 of @xcite , which allows to sample skeleton of trajectories exactly distributed as the solution to . this assumption could be modified in the case of a non constant diffusion matrix @xmath46 at the cost of a lot of technical complications .",
    "this model depends on the parameters @xmath34 , @xmath33 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we will discuss two cases whether @xmath34 is known or not in section  [ sec : em ] .",
    "as the @xmath29 s are symmetric positive definite matrices , @xmath47 or @xmath48 parameters have to be estimated .",
    "the aim of this paper is then to estimate these parameters using a set of @xmath2 independent and partially observed realizations @xmath49 of the process @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath51 observations of the @xmath52-th realization are observed at times @xmath53 and are denoted @xmath54 .",
    "parameter estimation for diffusion processes is a complicated task due to the unavailability of the transition density of the markov process defined by , see @xcite and the references therein for a recent survey .",
    "many methodologies introduce an approximation of this transition density , mostly based on euler scheme , see for instance @xcite for an explicit approximation which converges uniformly on the parameter space to the true transition density .",
    "see also @xcite for methods relying on approximate monte carlo maximum likelihood or @xcite for markov chain monte carlo methods combined with data augmentation . in this paper ,",
    "the estimation procedure is based on the exact algorithm introduced in @xcite .",
    "this algorithm allows to sample skeletons of trajectories exactly distributed as the finite dimensional distribution of the target sde .",
    "these skeletons can then be used to obtain unbiased monte carlo estimates of the intermediate quantity of the expectation maximization algorithm to define maximum likelihood estimates of @xmath30 , as described in @xcite .",
    "this section provides an algorithm to estimate the parameter @xmath30 using a set of @xmath2 independent trips @xmath3 .",
    "statistical inference based on a set of observations usually requires the finite - dimensional distributions of the process @xmath50 to be available .",
    "however , in the context of this paper , thanks to the results of @xcite , the likelihood of the complete path @xmath50 with respect to a reference measure on @xmath55 can be obtained easily using girsanov theorem even if the finite dimensional distribution of @xmath56 is not explicitly available .",
    "this setting is conducive to the use of the em algorithm proposed by @xcite which allows to perform maximum likelihood estimation when the joint distribution of the observations and some additional missing data is available . starting with an initial estimate @xmath57 , the em algorithm produces iteratively a sequence @xmath58 that converges toward a local maximum of the likelihood of the observations .",
    "the em based algorithm proposed in this paper relies on the monte carlo em procedure presented in @xcite .      for the sake of clarity ,",

    "the process considered in equation is not ergodic and exhibits brownian motion like behaviour when far from the attractive zone .",
    "nevertheless good asymptotic properties are obtained as the number of trajectories @xmath2 considered goes to infinity and the property of ergodicity is no more required .",
    "since this model is intended to be used for ecological trajectory data sets and the structure of the data will often consist in a large amount of ( presumably ) independent trajectories that allows the state space to be visited .",
    "the ergodic property for the solution of our process would be satisfied at the cost of a change in the drift adding a term which avoids the process to visit space to far from the attractive points .",
    "this model assumes that the diffusion coefficient is scalar , which is mainly a technical constraint .",
    "using the approach presented here , the diffusion must satisfy a conservative property , that is actually the core of our model",
    ". a major limitation of our approach for ecological users might be the time homogeneous potential map .",
    "this assumption guarantees the process solution to the sde to have markovian properties which greatly simplifies the estimation procedure .",
    "however , it is known that an individual might adopt different behaviors during its trips",
    ". it might be interesting to introduce state space models where different behaviors are considered .",
    "another interesting improvement would be to add interactions between individuals .",
    "an attraction / repulsion term could be added in the drift to indicate whether individuals are likely to cooperate or not .",
    "another limitation of our process is the non existence of a stationary distribution which is linked to the non ergodic property mentioned before .",
    "this is not a problem in practice since the starting point is close to attractive zones but , in theory , ecologists would rather consider an additional term to ensure the existence of a stationary distribution",
    ". this would be mandatory if considering only one unique long trajectory . as said above ,",
    "if this term still allow the function in to satisfy the conservative property , the estimation framework presented here would remain valid .",
    "to conclude , we believe the model presented here offers new insight for trajectory analysis .",
    "we propose a general model continuous in time and space , that requires no assumption on sampling frequency .",
    "we think that this gradient based model and its estimation framework could be easily extended to answer many ecological questions .",
