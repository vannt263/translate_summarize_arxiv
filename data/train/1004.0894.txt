    "a remarkable diversity of physical systems belong to the category of driven elastic manifolds moving over random landscapes .",
    "extensively studied examples are abundant in the literature : moving vortex lattices in type ii superconductors @xcite , sliding colloidal particles @xcite or charge density wave systems @xcite , magnetic bubble arrays @xcite , driven wigner crystals cha , crei and stripe forming systems @xcite . among the topics that have recently received much attention",
    "is the nature of the depinning mechanisms that occur as the external dc driving  force is increased beyond the critical force @xmath0 , and its relation with proliferation of topological defects in the form of bounded or unbounded disclinations .",
    "the dependence of the dynamics with initial conditions has been examined in detail and it was determined that for dc drives , memory of initial conditions is lost at depinning @xcite . a dynamical depinnig transition has been identified at a given force @xmath1 . for larger forces",
    "topological defects heal and smectic linear flow is observed @xcite .",
    "it should be noted however , that most of the research thrust has been specially focused on dc drives . in experiments ,",
    "an ac field is often applied to order the vortex lattice ( vl ) ; the most accepted picture is that the ac field assists the system in an equilibration process , from a disordered metastable configuration to the equilibrium bragg glass phase , free of dislocations @xcite .",
    "however , a large amount of results , in both experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite , show that , in some cases , an ac drive can disorder the vl , and that oscillatory dynamics plays an essential role .",
    "the oscillatory dynamics of the vl is in itself a broad field that is not completely understood .",
    "the main porpuse of this work is to provide a more comprehensive description , using numerical simulations , of ac driven vortex lattices over a random distribution of pinning sites .",
    "we explore the effect of the applied force amplitude for different frequencies , starting from different initial configurations .",
    "the vl mean velocity , which can be dephased from the excitation , is no longer an adequate observable to detect depinning and we show that instead , the mean quadratic displacement of the lattice is the relevant magnitude to identify depinning and dynamical ac regimes . the depinning transition becomes a crossover as is described below .",
    "the pinned linear campbell regime @xcite is also identified and simulations are compared with analytical calculations .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ numerical ] we describe in detail the numerical simulations ; starting with the model ( [ model ] ) , following with the numerical procedures ( [ procedures ] ) and giving the definition of the observables ( [ ob ] ) . in sec . [ results ] we present and discuss the results and in sec . [ con ]",
    "we highlight the main conclusions .",
    "in our simulations , we consider @xmath2 rigid vortices with coordinates @xmath3 in a two - dimensional rectangle of size @xmath4 that evolve according to the dynamics    @xmath5    where @xmath6 its velocity and @xmath7 the bardeen - stephen viscosity coefficient and @xmath8 is given by the sum of the vortex - vortex interaction , the pinning attraction and the lorentz force    @xmath9    the vortex - vortex interaction per unit length is given by ,    @xmath10    where    @xmath11    here , @xmath12 is the quantum of magnetic flux , @xmath13 is the london penetration length and @xmath14 the special bessel function .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is dimensionless and can be related to the stiffness of the vortex lattice ( see ref . ) .",
    "the @xmath16 pinning centers are supposed to be located at random positions @xmath17 , and their interaction with vortices is modeled by    @xmath18    @xmath19 ( chosen from a gaussian distribution with mean value @xmath20 and a standard deviation of @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 tune the strength and range of the interaction .",
    "the lorentz force per unit length is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the external driving current density and @xmath25 is the versor perpendicular to the plane .    following ref .",
    "we measure lengths in units of @xmath13 , forces ( per unit length ) in units of @xmath26 , time in units of @xmath27 and frequency in units of @xmath28 . in our simulation",
    ", we will consider @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    concerning the numerical details , the equations of motion are integrated using a standard euler algorithm with step @xmath34 , and a hard cut - off @xmath35 in calculating the vortex - vortex force . when calculating physical observables we average over four realizations of disorder .",
    "the ac drive is simulated with an external square ac force of the form @xmath36    we study vortex lattice evolution as we vary the force in a slow ramping of @xmath37 starting from different initial conditions . in each case",
    ", we leave the system evolving  from the initial configuration with zero external force for 5 cycles .",
    "this free evolution creates or annihilates a low density of defects and becomes our metastable initial state .",
    "a numerical realization will be obtained by ramping from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , applying @xmath40 cycles this new force , and then allowing the system to relax for @xmath41 cycles at zero force , before reassuming the ramping .",
    "measuring is performed during the last cycle , just before switching off the applied force ( i.e. during cycle @xmath40 ) .",
    "it is by now well known that the mobility of the vl is affected by the topology of the vl configuration .",
    "a common observable used to characterize the vl configuration is the density of lattice defects , @xmath42 , ( i.e. vortices with 5 or 7 neighbors in the delaunay triangulation ) .",
    "the mobility itself is characterized by the vortex velocity . the instantaneous mean vortex velocity in the direction of the applied force at time @xmath43 is    @xmath44    in the dc case , the @xmath45 vs @xmath46 curves can be directly related with experimental current - voltage characteristics ( @xmath47 curves ) .    in the ac case",
    "the relationship between velocity and force and the experimental @xmath47 curve is more subtle , as the phase between the applied force and the velocity plays an essential role .",
    "we then define the half cycle mean velocity in the @xmath48 cycle as    @xmath49    notice that the half cycle velocity takes into acount this phase factor .",
    "we estimate the mean phase factor @xmath50 by applying a sinusoidal @xmath51 and calculating the phase between @xmath46 and the first harmonic of the mean velocity @xmath52 in the @xmath48 cycle .",
    "moreover , a quantity of interest is the average quadratic displacement defined as    @xmath53    in the ac case , we can take @xmath54 , the mean quadratic displacement in the force direction after performing @xmath55 oscillations . this quantity , as we will show below , is very useful for describing ac drives .",
    "throughout the work we have explored the behaviour of the system as a function of the ac amplitude .",
    "recent numerical studies on a similar system ( colloids under the influence of an external ac drive and quenched disorder ) @xcite have found a crossover from a low drive - highly disorderd phase to a high drive - low disordered phase . in all cases considered in ref .",
    "the initial configuration was highly disordered .",
    "our results confirm the existence of the high drive - low disorderd phase but we will show that when more general initial conditions are considered then richer , low drive phases emerge .     ( a ) and half cycle mean velocity @xmath56 ( b ) ( see text ) as a function of the amplitude of the applied lorentz force @xmath38 for different frequencies @xmath57 .",

    "we clearly identify three different regimes , a pinned lattice for @xmath64 , a disordered flow ( plastic ) region for @xmath65 and a flowing ( smectic ) linear regime for @xmath66 consistent with previous work @xcite .",
    "while the existence of @xmath67 can be inferred form these ac curves , as the value for which all curves that present plastic motion merge , the distinction between the pinned and plastic regimes is less apparent .",
    "this is so , because even a weak driving force produces oscillations of vortices around their pinning centers with finite mean velocity .",
    "this is a strong argument to abandon the mean velocity as the adequate observable to indicate depinning .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ ndvsfl_frec]b shows an enlarged area for small driving forces : at very small ac amplitudes a linear campbell regime holds but the response becomes non - linear at amplitudes well bellow @xmath68 .",
    "the definition of a critical force in the ac response is therefore not so obvious , and we will discuss this point in detail later .    in the ac curves , we distinguish two frequency regimes : at low frequencies ( @xmath69 in our simulation ) , restoring and pinning forces prevail over losses , whereas at high frequencies viscous drag dominates .",
    "the low frequency regime is characterized by a highly nonlinear response at intermediate ac amplitudes , associated with a pronounced peak in @xmath42 .",
    "this feature smears at higher frequencies , the density of topological defects decreases , and the non - linearity is less apparent , going to a linear ohmicregime ( blue down triangles ) at very high frequency ( @xmath70 ) where dissipative forces govern .",

    ", there is a dynamic reordering and the pinning potential is completely smeared .",

    "this critical frequency @xmath120 has been estimated by fitting results of numerical simulations at low ac amplitudes with that predicted by an analytical model .",
    "the reorganization of vortex defects by ac drives from initially different configurations and for different ac protocols produce history dependent vortex lattice configurations with different density of defects and mobility .    as an important result",

    "this observable is univocally related with the applied force , and seems to be the best one to characterize the ac regimes .",
    "this should be contrasted with the mobility that can be large even in pinned ac driven lattices .",
    "as expected , a linear campbell regime holds at very low ac amplitudes ( @xmath122  ) whereas the response is ohmic at very high ac amplitudes ( @xmath123  ) where there is a dynamic reordering and the pinning potential is completely smeared . in both linear responses",
