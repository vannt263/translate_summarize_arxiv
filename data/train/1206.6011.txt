    "one of the most fundamental problems in general relativity is the construction of realistic models describing various evolutionary stages of a star collapsing under its own gravity .",
    "when a star exhausts all its thermonuclear fuel , it can not withstand the gravitational pull and starts collapsing .",
    "as it contracts appreciably , the density increases and at a sufficiently high density it produces non - thermal pressure via degenerate fermions and particle interactions to support it against further collapse and becomes a ` compact star ' .",
    "stable stellar configurations like neutron stars are the end products of such radiative collapse processes . a massive star , however , can not come to a stable stage by such processes . in the absence of any mechanism that can withstand the gravitational pull ,",
    "the general relativistic prediction is that such a collapse must terminate into a space - time singularity . in view of the cosmic censorship conjecture(ccc )",
    ", such a singularity must be covered within its event horizon of gravity@xcite .",
    "however , there are several counter examples where a naked singularity is more likely to be formed .",
    "in fact , there is yet no established theory available governing the formation of either a black hole or a naked singularity ( for a recent review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the physics of evolving dynamical systems , therefore , continues to generate a great deal of interest in various fields of astrophysics and cosmology even today .    to understand the nature of collapse of a self gravitating body",
    ", one needs to provide an accurate description of the exterior and interior space - times of the collapsing body .",
    "it is also necessary to find out the appropriate boundary conditions joining the two regions .",
    "the theoretical understanding of gravitational collapse was first initiated by oppenheimer and snyder@xcite who considered the contraction of a highly idealized spherically symmetric dust cloud .",
    "the exterior space - time of the collapsing dust cloud was described by the schwarzschild metric and the interior space - time was represented by a friedman - like solution .",
    "later on , the vaidya@xcite metric corresponding to the exterior gravitational field of a stellar body describing an outgoing null fluid gave a tremendous impetus in this direction .",
    "making use of the vaidya@xcite solution , santos@xcite proposed a procedure to obtain the description of the interior space - time of a spherically symmetric radially shrinking distribution of non - adiabatic fluid .",
    "several stellar models ( see for example , @xcite and references therein ) have been obtained and examined critically using santos s approach .",
    "the procedure has been found to be useful to examine the impact of various factors such as shear , inhomogeneity , anisotropy , electromagnetic field and various dissipative processes on the evolution . in the absence of any established theory governing the nature of collapse",
    ", such investigations have been found to be very useful to understand the dynamic behaviour of a gravitationally collapsing system .",
    "the objective of the present work is to formulate a framework to study the nature of collapse of an inhomogeneously distributed anisotropic source .",
    "the dynamical behaviour of a gravitating system is expected to be influenced by density inhomogeneity and anisotropy . amongst many other issues ,",
    "these factors have been found to play crucial role in our theoretical understanding of the nature of singularity and its genericity ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "eardley and smarr@xcite have shown that inhomogeneous distributions may lead to a naked singularity in contrast to a homogeneous distribution where a black hole is more likely to be formed . for a spherically symmetric dust cloud , mena _ et al_@xcite have examined the role of inhomogeneity and anisotropy in lamaitre - tolman - bondi collapse .",
    "et al_@xcite have examined the role of various factors contributing to inhomogeneity of matter distribution , its evolution and development of anisotropy .",
    "it has been observed that tidal forces tend to make a gravitating system more inhomogeneous which may lead to the formation of a naked singularity while for a homogeneously distributed body it is more likely to form a black hole .",
    "similar observations may be found in @xcite where it has been shown that if an initially static star undergoing collapse has a homogeneous distribution it ends up with the formation of a black hole .",
    "however , if an anisotropic star contains an inhomogeneous distribution of matter before the collapse sets in , then for a shearing model of collapse , the black hole is never formed as the condition for the formation of apparent horizon is never satisfied under such a condition@xcite .",
    "pressure anisotropy also plays a significant role in the construction of a dynamically evolving system .",
    "elaborate discussions on the microscopic origin of anisotropic stresses in stellar bodies may be found in @xcite,@xcite . amongst many other factors , electromagnetic field and shear",
    "have been found to contribute significantly to the generation of anisotropic stresses . the effect of charge on non - static models of gravitationally bound objects",
    "have been investigated by many authors@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "shear is also a generator of anisotropic stresses@xcite .",
    "effects of shear and anisotropy in the dynamical behaviour of a self gravitating system have been analyzed by govinder _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "it has been observed that if a star has isotropic pressure before the collapse sets in , anisotropy may develop at a later stage due to the presence of shear@xcite .    in our work , we have developed a model describing a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous anisotropic fluid configuration radiating away its energy in the form of radial heat flux and shrinking in size as the collapse proceeds . in our construction",
    ", we have assumed that the collapsing star is charge neutral and the back ground space - time is shear - free .",
    "however , the energy - momentum tensor corresponding to the fluid distribution filling the interior of the collapsing star has been assumed to be anisotropic , in general .",
    "the model developed here is a generalization of an earlier model presented by banerjee _ et al_@xcite describing the collapse of a homogeneously distributed isotropic fluid .",
    "sch@xmath0fer and goenner@xcite used the banerjee _",
    "et al_@xcite model to investigate the collapse of a homogeneously distributed isotropic fluid configuration and also critically analyzed various features of the model parameters involving the background space - time . in the sch@xmath0fer and goenner@xcite model",
    ", the collapse begins at time @xmath1 with both infinite mass and radius and contracts to a point at time @xmath2 without forming an event horizon .",
    "the horizon is never formed in this set up because the rate of collapse is counter balanced by the rate at which energy is dissipated to the exterior space - time of the star .    in our construction , we have traced the evolution of the collapse on the background of space - time obtained by introducing an inhomogeneous perturbation in the robertson - walker space - time .",
    "inhomogeneity in the geometry of the background space - time may be interpreted in the following way .",
    "we have considered the @xmath3-sub - space of the @xmath4-d manifold as having a geometry of a @xmath3-spheroid rather than a @xmath3-sphere as in @xcite .",
    "we have examined the impacts of inhomogeneous nature of background space - time and anisotropic stresses on the collapse by comparing the behaviour of physical parameters in our set up to the behaviour of corresponding parameters in banerjee _ et al_@xcite model , admissible as a special class in our model .",
    "we have also explored the thermal behaviour at the interior of the collapsing star by considering two different space - time backgrounds .",
    "we have not incorporated bulk viscosity and electromagnetic field in our model as these factors are likely to be absorbed into the anisotropic stresses .",
    "we have also considered a shear - free model so as to keep the governing field equations reasonably simple and tractable . moreover , since the sch@xmath0fer and goenner@xcite model was assumed to be shear - free , this simplifying assumption helps us to examine the impact of inhomogeneity directly by comparing our results to its homogeneous counterpart .    the paper has been organized as follows : in section @xmath5 , we have presented an inhomogeneous generalization of the banerjee _ et al_@xcite model by introducing a perturbation in the background space - time for a spherically symmetric anisotropic fluid undergoing non - adiabatic radiative collapse .",
