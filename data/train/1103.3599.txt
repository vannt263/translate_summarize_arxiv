    "there are currently 538 officially confirmed extrasolar planets known to astronomy , a substantial fraction of which belong to the ` hot jupiters ' category of jovian - type planets that orbit within @xmath9au of their host star . improved observational precision has , in recent years , led to the discovery of extreme examples of this class of planet with orbital semi - major axes of the order of @xmath10au or less(see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the jovian masses and small orbital separations of these planets imply that they interact tidally with their host stars .",
    "tidal interactions between stars and planets were first studied in the context of the solar system @xcite , and have also been extensively studied as they apply to binary systems @xcite , but it is only comparatively recently that such studies have been extended to consider exoplanetary systems .",
    "tidal interactions lead to long - term changes in the orbital parameters of a planet , specifically the eccentricity and the semi - major axis ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the end result of this process is the spiral - in of the planet towards its host until it reaches the roche limit , where it undergoes mass transfer through the l1 point @xcite , becoming disrupted in the process .",
    "previous studies of tidal evolution have , for the most part , focused on the effect of tidal interactions on these two orbital parameters whilst neglecting the evolution of other parameters that are involved .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the effects of tidal interactions extend to the rotation rates of the two bodies , but until recently little work had been done to investigate this aspect of tidal theory as applied to exoplanetary systems .",
    "there is , however , mounting interest in this aspect of exoplanetary tides , with several studies investigating the large scale effect of the presence of exoplanets on stellar rotation @xcite , and some work investigating tidal interactions specifically @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the rotation rate of an isolated star declines with age through the action of magnetic braking @xcite , which leads asymptotically to a power - law decay of rotation rate with the inverse square root of stellar age @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a method for determining the ages of stars using their rotation periods and colours , based on a skumanich - type magnetic braking law and calibrated using the solar rotation period , as an alternative to stellar model fitting .",
    "what appears to be less widely recognized , or at least acknowledged , is that the torques that act on both star and planet as a result of tidal interactions can affect this natural rotational evolution , and may be sufficiently strong to overwhelm it , at least for short periods of time .    in this paper",
    "we simulate the evolution of hot jupiter systems to investigate the effects on the orbital eccentricity , orbital separation , planetary rotation rate and stellar rotation rate of tidal interactions between hot jupiters and their host stars . in section[sec : maths ] we set out the mathematical basis for our models , whilst in section[sec : compute ] we describe the computational methods that were used .",
    "section[sec : wasp18 ] and section[sec : wasp19 ] contain discussion of the application of our simulations to the specific cases of the wasp-18 and wasp-19 systems respectively .",
    "it should be noted that these systems were not selected at random , but were chosen owing to pre - existing disagreement between age estimates calculated using different methods .",
    "these transiting hot jupiters also have two of the shortest known orbital periods , and are therefore particularly susceptible to the influence of tidal interactions .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite and @xcite tidal energy is dissipated within a star and planet whose spin axes are aligned with the orbital axis at rates defined by the tidal quality factors @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the tidal love numbers of the two bodies .",
    "the eccentricity of the orbit evolves at a rate @xmath15+\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{81}{2}\\frac{n}{q'_s}\\frac{m_p}{m_s}\\left(\\frac{r_s}{a}\\right)^5 \\left[-f1(e)+\\frac{11}{18}\\frac{\\omega_s}{n}f_2(e)\\right ] \\label{eq : dlnedt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 the star and planet have masses @xmath18 and @xmath19 and radii @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively , and rotation rates @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the orbital frequency is defined by kepler s 3rd law , @xmath24 .",
    "if the system is fully aligned , then the total angular momentum of the orbit and the axial rotation of the star and the planet , perpendicular to the orbit , is @xmath25 the stellar and planetary moments of inertia are determined by their effective squared radii of gyration , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "angular momentum is carried away from the system via a magnetically - channeled , thermally - driven stellar wind , at a rate described by a standard weber - davis model @xmath28 where the stellar moment of inertia @xmath29 .",
    "the physical scaling of the braking rate is determined by the constant of proportionality @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the ` saturation ' rotation rate above which the stellar magnetic field strength is assumed to become independent of the stellar rotation rate .",
    "we use the expressions of @xcite to describe the tidal spin evolution of the planet to the tidal torque : @xmath32 \\label{eq : dompdt}\\ ] ] and the star under the influence of both tidal and wind torques : @xmath33 \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\kappa\\omega_s{\\rm min}(\\omega_s,\\tilde{\\omega})^2 .",

    "the quantity @xmath42 is derived directly from the transit duration for a transiting planet , enabling @xmath43 to be estimated from directly - observed quantities for a given value of @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite recently suggested that parametrizing the tidal evolution equations in this manner , with the stellar and planetary tidal quality factors constant in time , is not equivalent to the more traditional approach of considering either a constant phase lag or a constant time lag of the tidal bulge .",
    "they further suggested that such equations , if truncated to o(@xmath44 ) , produce both qualitatively and quantitatively incorrect evolutionary histories for systems with @xmath45 , and promote the use of equations derived from @xcite . despite using a constant tidal quality factor model the tidal equations that we use in this work",
    "are not truncated in this fashion , and thus do not suffer from the problems that @xcite describe .",
    "an estimate of the value of the scaling constant for magnetic braking , @xmath30 , is required to implement ( [ eq : ldotwind ] ) . following the standard weber - davis model ,",
    "the rate of change of the rotation rate of an isolated star owing to magnetic braking can be described by @xmath46 integrating this under the assumption that @xmath47 and @xmath48 gives @xmath49which leads to the standard power law for magnetic braking , @xmath50 with @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "this neglect of the initial conditions is justified by the observed strong convergence of spin rates to a narrow period - colour relation in the hyades @xcite , and in other clusters of similar ages .",
    "we set @xmath52 , calculated by scaling the @xmath53-(j - k ) colour relationship found for the coma - berenices cluster by @xcite and using j and k magnitudes taken from the simbad on - line data archive , to obtain an estimate for @xmath30 at the age of the hyades .",
    "this value is assumed to be constant throughout the evolution of the system .",
    "for simplicity , in all cases the planet s rotation is initially assumed to be tidally locked such that @xmath54 , but @xmath23 is permitted to evolve independently thereafter .",
    "more recent work has found that the braking law exponent , @xmath55 , diverges slightly from the ideal @xcite value in some environments ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if we generalise equation[eq : omegadot ] to raise @xmath56 to the power @xmath57 , then we derive @xmath58a universal expression for @xmath30 with @xmath59 .",
    "we calibrated our implementation of the magnetic braking power law using the stars listed in table@xmath60 of @xcite , finding that an exponent of @xmath61 gives good agreement between the measured rotation periods and the evolved stellar rotation rates calculated using our method .",
    "we found that there was little to differentiate the evolutionary tracks produced using values of @xmath55 within this range , and therefore adopted the central value of @xmath62 .",
    "starting from a given set of initial conditions @xmath63 , we integrate the four equations ( [ eq : dlnedt ] ) , ( [ eq : dompdt ] ) , ( [ eq : domsdt ] ) , and ( [ eq : dlnadt ] ) using a fourth - order runge - kutta scheme , adapted from algorithms in @xcite .",
    "the unit of time is 1gyr , and the integration is allowed to run for the approximate main - sequence lifetime , @xmath64gyr for a star of mass @xmath18 , or until the planet reaches the roche limit , as defined by @xcite . to calculate the stellar radius of gyration the metallicity and mass of the star",
    "are used to select an appropriate table from @xcite ; at each timestep we interpolate through this data using the current time to derive a value for @xmath26 .",
    "this is not an entirely accurate method , as the series of papers by @xcite provides only tables for discrete values of metallicity and stellar mass that in many cases do not coincide with the metallicity of the systems being studied . in these cases",
    "we therefore use the table that most closely corresponds to our data .",
    "we use the observed values of @xmath65 , @xmath22 and @xmath66 , and their uncertainties , to evaluate the goodness - of - fit statistic at each timestep according to @xmath67 to this we add a bayesian prior on the stellar age @xmath68 to obtain the statistic @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the stellar age estimated from the star s density and effective temperature @xcite , and its associated uncertainty . the age of the system is taken to be the time of the step at which c is a minimum .",
    "this forward integration method was built into two separate computational schemes : a grid search that carried out the integration for each node in a four - dimensional grid in @xmath72-@xmath73-@xmath74-@xmath75 parameter space , and a markov - chain monte - carlo ( mcmc ) optimisation scheme to determine the posterior probability distributions of @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath73 and @xmath72 , and to refine the estimates of the initial parameters returned by the grid search .",
    "the best - fitting evolutionary history investigated by the grid search is taken to be the solution that returns the absolute minimum value of the c statistic , whilst under the mcmc scheme the best - fitting set of parameters are taken to be the median values of the respective posterior probability distributions , with @xmath76 errors derived from the values that delineate the central @xmath77percent of the distribution .",
    "we choose this approach over the absolute minimum , as the latter strongly depends on the precise sampling of the parameter space by any given markov chain .",
    "it was assumed that the orbit of the planet would monotonically shrink throughout the integration , thus placing a lower limit on the initial semi - major axis of @xmath78 .",
    "the upper limit on the same parameter was set at @xmath79au , a value which encompasses @xmath80percent of the current distribution for transiting planets .",
    "the ranges of the tidal quality factors were set to @xmath81 and @xmath82 such that the commonly accepted ranges of values ( @xmath83 for @xmath0 , @xmath84 for @xmath1 @xcite ) were encompassed together with an additional section of parameter space .",
    "the initial eccentricity distribution for the ensemble of exoplanets is the subject of much discussion .",
    "a value of @xmath85 encompasses @xmath86percent of the present distribution and limits our parameter space to the region of validity for our tidal equations , as defined by @xcite .",
    "however the migration method by which hot jupiters find themselves at such short orbital periods is still uncertain .",
    "one particular mechanism , kozai scattering @xcite , can pump the eccentricity to large values , and it has been suggested that short period planets are captured at periastron from such highly eccentric orbits",
    ". if this is the case then a much higher upper limit on @xmath73 could be justified .",
    "we must thus take into account the initial times at which we will be starting our integrations .",
    "@xcite carried out a survey of tidal circularisation in binary stars .",
    "they found that open clusters show a characteristic orbital period at which binaries with the most common initial eccentricity circularise ( they define a circularised orbit as one with @xmath87 ) .",
    "this period was found to vary with the age of the cluster .",
    "however it is questionable whether exoplanets , owing to the much lower secondary mass , will tend to circularise at the same orbital period .",
    "in fact @xcite applied the formalism of @xcite to exoplanetary systems , finding that circularisation periods were generally much shorter than for stellar binaries .",
    "we therefore set @xmath88 , a value encompassing 99percent of the current distribution for transiting exoplanets , to allow for the possibility of eccentric orbits produced by kozai oscillations .",
    "it is important to note that stellar and planetary obliquities greater than @xmath89 are not considered by the integration methods used herein owing to the algebraic formulation that underlies our computational methods .",
    "we therefore assume that the orbital and spin angular momenta vectors are aligned , or anti - aligned .      under our mcmc optimisation scheme , the coordinates of the origin for the markov chain",
    "are set to the centre of the parameter space .",
    "an exception is made if this lies within @xmath90 of the coordinates of the best - fitting initial conditions , in which case the origin coordinates are set to lie outwith the @xmath90 contour in parameter space .",
    "the burn - in phase was judged to be complete when the minimum value of the test statistic from the current integration exceeded the median of all previous minimum test statistic values for the first time @xcite .",
    "the hot jupiter wasp-18b orbits the star @xmath91 , an f6 star with an effective temperature @xmath92k and a v magnitude of @xmath93 , situated approximately @xmath94pc from the earth .",
    "a fit to stellar isochrones using the model of @xcite gives a stellar age of @xmath95gyr , which can be further constrained using the observed lithium abundance .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter ) therefore assign the system an age of @xmath96gyr , a value that the current work attempts to improve upon .",
    "wasp-18b was the first planet _ confirmed _ to have a period of less than a day , orbiting its host in just @xmath97days .",
    "recent measurements of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect by @xcite have shown that the system is well aligned ; the assumption of spin - orbit alignment required for our analysis is therefore justified . in the absence of a measured rotation period for wasp-18 , we assume that the inclination of the stellar axis is @xmath98 such that @xmath99 and @xmath100 .    lcc + parameter & value & units +   + @xmath18 & @xmath101 & @xmath102 + @xmath20 & @xmath103 & @xmath104 + @xmath105 & @xmath106 & + @xmath107 & @xmath108 & k + @xmath109 & @xmath110 & kms@xmath111 + @xmath112 & @xmath113 & days + system age & @xmath95 & gyr + @xmath19 & @xmath114 & @xmath115 + @xmath21 & @xmath116 & @xmath117 + @xmath66 & @xmath118 & au + @xmath65 & @xmath119 & + @xmath120 & @xmath121 & @xmath122 + @xmath123 & @xmath124 & days + @xmath125 & @xmath126 & @xmath122 +   +    an observed system age of @xmath127gyr was used for the calculation of the c - statistic for this system , in line with the age found from stellar isochrones by .",
    "wasp-18b has a radius of the order of that of jupiter , but is significantly more massive .",
    "lacking a means of calculating @xmath27 however , we set @xmath128 as a reasonable estimate .    in light of the observed system age being consistent with the age of the hyades , we compared @xmath112 from table[tab:1 ] to @xmath129 , as calculated for our derivation of @xmath30 for the system , finding the observed stellar rotation period to be shorter than the expected rotation period of @xmath130days at the age of the hyades .",
    "we therefore set @xmath131gyr@xmath132 , calculating @xmath133 by scaling the period colour relation of @xcite to this age .",
    "the c - statistic values returned by the grid search were converted into probability densities according to @xmath134 and plotted as a set of projection maps ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "these indicate regions of high probability , and therefore low points in the c - statistic surface , for each pair of initial parameters , and appear to show that there are a range of values for each parameter that could produce plausible evolutionary histories with a good quality of fit .",
    "this is particularly noticeable in @xmath73 and @xmath135 , indicating that these parameters have a lesser impact on the orbital and spin evolution of the system than @xmath72 and @xmath74 .",
    "this is , to a certain extent , unsurprising ; the current orbital eccentricity for wasp-18b is more uncertain than the orbital separation , and so will have less influence on the value of the c - statistic .",
    "it is also interesting to note the generally sharp transitions in fig.[fig:1 ] between regions with @xmath136 and those with @xmath137 .",
    "this indicates that although the values of the initial parameters are somewhat uncertain , they are generally well constrained to a smaller region of parameter space than we have allowed for .    the best - fitting combination of initial parameters in these projection maps was found to be @xmath138au , @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , indicating a system age of @xmath142gyr in good agreement with the existing estimate derived from stellar model fitting . using the period colour relation of @xcite we calculate an age of @xmath143gyr for wasp-18 using the derived rotation period , inconsistent with both the age from isochrone analysis and the result of our grid search . from the evolutionary track we derive an extremely short remaining lifetime of 0.006gyr , implying that the planet is currently spiralling in towards its host and is on the verge of reaching the roche limit .",
    "this seems incredibly short , and would mean that we have managed to observe wasp-18b in a very short window of opportunity .",
    "this result is , however , at oodds with the results that we have obtained from our second integration method , the mcmc algorithm .",
    "the posterior probability distributions produced by the mcmc integration scheme ( fig.[fig:2 ] ) indicate significant correlation between many of the pairs of initial orbital parameters , in particular @xmath72 and @xmath74 although it is also noticeable in several of the other distributions .",
    "some correlation is to be expected ; the orbital circularisation time - scale depends on energy dissipation within both the star and the planet @xcite , and so a correlation between the eccentricity and the quality factors that govern tidal energy dissipation is unsurprising .",
    "the correlation between @xmath72 and @xmath73 may arise as a result of the strong coupling between eccentricity and separation noted by @xcite .",
    "the rapidity with which the orbital separation can decrease is intrinsically linked to the efficiency with which energy is dissipated within the system , a process that is governed by the tidal quality factors .",
    "moreover inspection of ( [ eq : dlnadt ] ) indicates that @xmath144 , so the form of the correlation between @xmath72 and @xmath74 that is observed is also as expected .",
    "in fact it is surprising that little to no correlation is observed between @xmath72 and @xmath75    the best - fitting parameters found using the mcmc code are set out in table[tab:2 ] , and imply a stellar age of @xmath145gyr , in agreement with the existing age obtained through isochrone fitting , and the age derived from our grid search results .",
    "fig.[fig:3 ] displays the evolution of the stellar rotation for the set of best - fitting parameters ; it is important to recall that the age estimate is not evaluated solely on the basis of this parameter , and that the observed orbital eccentricity and semi - major axis play a part as well .",
    "the value of @xmath74 returned by the mcmc - derived integration scheme does not agree with the best - fitting value obtained from the grid search of the defined parameter space . nor do the values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we attribute this to the adoption of the set of median parameters from the mcmc scheme to avoid chance encounters with local minima , as well as the discrete nature of the grid search .",
    "comparison of the solution with the lowest value of the c test statistic shows a value of @xmath74 that fits more closely to the grid search result , albeit still in disagreement , although we note that the minimum test statistic value for the grid search is an order of magnitude lower than that for the mcmc exploration of the available parameter space .",
    "we also note that although figs.[fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] are broadly similar in form , they differ somewhat in detail .",
    "the same correlations between parameters are visible in both figures , but the cutoff in @xmath74 occurs at a slightly greater value in fig.[fig:2 ] than fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "additionally , the mcmc algorithm explores a more narrow range of both @xmath72 and @xmath73 parameter space than the grid search , but does explore the lower end of @xmath75 space , a region which the grid search suggests gives poor results .",
    "we again attribute this to the differences in the manner in which the two algorithms explore the parameter space that we have delineated .",

    "the evolutionary track produced using the mcmc results implies a remaining lifetime of @xmath157gyr for the planet , consistent with this value .",
    "these are , respectively , @xmath158 and @xmath159percent of the expected main sequence lifetime of the host star , which we estimate to be @xmath160gyr .",
    "these remaining lifetimes strongly imply that the wasp-18 planetary system has an short life expectancy , as found by .",
    "although still quite short , these values are far more reasonable than the value of 6myr derived from the grid search .",
    "the evolution of the stellar rotation period ( fig.[fig:3 ] ) for the set of initial parameters returned by the mcmc integration scheme indicates that the rotational evolution of the star under the influence of tides initially differs little from our simulation in which the rotation period is governed purely by a skumanich - type magnetic braking law .",
    "however the evolution of the rotation period rapidly diverges from this ideal case , with the rate of spin - down slowing gradually as the star ages and the planet migrates towards its host under the influence of tidal interactions .",
    "the final spiral - in of the planetary companion causes a rapid and substantial spin - up of the star ; during this process the stellar rotation period is reduced by almost a factor of two from its maximum @xmath161day period to @xmath162days at the roche limit , suggesting significant spin up of the host star .",
    "furthermore , fig.[fig:3 ] clearly shows that , for the age estimate returned by our mcmc integration scheme , the observed rotation period of the host star is quite inconsistent with the rotation period of @xmath163days that would be expected at the same age if tidal interactions played no part in the evolution of stellar rotation .        although the best - fitting parameters that we have adopted show wasp-18b in the process of its final spiral in , the true picture is slightly more ambiguous , as evidenced by the large upper uncertainty on the remaining lifetime . within",
    "the @xmath76 parameter ranges there exist combinations of the initial parameters that produce evolutionary tracks of a different form to that displayed in fig.[fig:3 ] .",
    "these evolutionary tracks follow the stellar rotation curve produced by a purely magnetic braking scenario for a much longer period of time , and exhibit little spin up of the host star . furthermore , in semi - major axis space they indicate that the planet stays at approximately the same semi - major axis for the duration of the star s main sequence lifetime . in these cases",
    "the age of the system lies towards the lower end of the adopted range , owing to the necessity of conforming to the calculated stellar rotation period , and the planet has a long remaining lifetime .",
    "we note however that these solutions form only a minority of the evolutionary tracks consistent with the parameter ranges that we adopt from the mcmc results .",
    "more prevalent were tracks of the same form as that displayed in fig.[fig:3 ] , but with the spin - up taking place much later such that the stellar rotation implies an age consistent with the gyrochronological estimate and magnetic - braking only scenario .",
    "we attempted to further constrain the range of possible tidal quality factors by visually fitting to the observed parameters and their associated @xmath76 uncertainties .",
    "starting from the best - fitting initial orbital separation and eccentricity , we investigated the evolution of the system across the range of values for both @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we found that changing the value of @xmath75 makes no difference to the evolution of the orbital separation or rotation period , but has a strong effect on the eccentricity evolution of the planetary orbit .",
    "@xmath74 , in contrast , strongly affects the evolution of all integration parameters .",
    "moreover we found that changing the initial semi - major axis , within the adopted range , made a significant difference to the evolution of the stellar rotation period , whilst modifying @xmath73 merely affected the evolution of the orbital eccentricity .",
    "we therefore conclude that the two most important parameters with respect to the stellar rotation are @xmath0 and @xmath72 .",
    "we were unable to constrain the permissible ranges of the two tidal quality factors any further , owing to the range of values that @xmath72 was able take , but found that for the majority of the possible combinations the rotational evolution of wasp-18a gradually diverges from that expected of a purely magnetic braking scenario , and that the star is eventually spun - up by a substantial amount during the final in - spiral of its planetary companion .",
    "fig.[fig:4a ] shows the rotational period evolution resulting from several values of @xmath74 within the permissible range , with @xmath75 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 set to values adopted from the mcmc search .",

    "since our investigation into wasp-18b s future evolution led us to the conclusion that @xmath73 and @xmath75 have little effect on the evolution of the stellar rotation , we set these parameters to the mcmc values from table[tab:4 ] .",

    "the majority of the nodes gave solutions that either did not reach an age of @xmath195gyr , instead showing the distinctive spiral - in signature at younger ages , or that followed the magnetic braking - only track for much longer such that the spin - up induced by the final spiral - in was insufficient to reduce the stellar rotation period back to the observed value .",
    "tracks that fell into this latter category often returned ages consistent with our gyrochronological calculation , although some did return older ages consistent with the @xmath195gyr lower limit owing to the influence of the orbital eccentricity and semi - major axis .",
    "this raises questions concerning wasp-19a s true age .",
    "there is evidence from isochrone fitting that the star is older than 1gyr .",
    "this is supported by the investigation of into the space velocity of the star , which found that 65percent of simulated stars with similar stellar properties in a small volume around wasp-19a were older than 1.0gyr .",
    "but the rotation period of wasp-19a implies a younger age of @xmath222gyr through gyrochronology . the lithium abundance of @xmath223)<1.0 $ ] quoted by , while consistent with either estimate as it only constrains the age to greater than @xmath224gyr , would appear to support a younger age , as the presence of any lithium tends to rule out a more evolved star .",
    "there therefore appear to be two main possibilities ; either the star is old and has been spun up by the infall of the planet , or the star is younger , still following its natural spin down and more dense and/or hotter than expected for its age . both of these are consistent with the results that we have obtained from our search methods , so which is the more plausible ?",

    "furthermore we find that wasp-4b has a remaining lifetime of @xmath226gyr , and calculate that it lies at a distance of only 1.4 times the roche limit from its host star ; this places it in apparently similar circumstances to wasp-19b . wasp-2b and wasp-10b have remaining lifetimes at least one order of magnitude greater than those of the rest of the sample , but they also have significantly longer orbital periods .",

    "there were , however , some histories that married an older age for the star to a long remaining lifetime for the planet , so we are unable to completely rule out that scenario .",

    "our results imply that wasp-18b will reach the roche limit in @xmath155gyr , and that in most cases it will cause its host to spin up as it does so .",
    "we are unable to place stronger constraints the status of the system with respect to planetary infall owing to the range of evolutionary histories that we find to be compatible with its observed parameters , but a large number of the evolutionary tracks investigated imply that the planet is in the process of spiralling in to its host star .",
    "our results for the wasp-18 system seem roughly consistent with the work of @xcite .    for the wasp-19 system we found tidal quality factors of @xmath347 and @xmath6 .",
    "these values give a stellar age of @xmath7gyr , in broad agreement with the constraint of @xmath348gyr found by , and imply a remaining lifetime of @xmath8gyr .",
    "we have investigated the possibility that wasp-19a is younger than previously estimated , in line with the predictions of gyrochronology . after considering the evidence for both the old and young stellar age possibilities ,",
    "we conclude that the older age is more probable based on a reanalysis of the spectral lithium abundance and updated stellar model fits .",
    "we therefore suggest that wasp-19b could be in the final stages of its spiral - in , and could be on the verge of reaching the roche limit .",
    "we found that this scenario was more prevalent amongst those evolutionary histories with a stellar age @xmath167gyr , but that there were some instances in which the older stellar age coincided with a substantial remaining planetary lifetime .",
    "we are therefore unable to rule out the possibility that it will be some time before the planet falls into the star .",
    "tidal interactions between these two hot jupiters and their host stars will dramatically affect the evolution of the stellar rotation periods , counteracting and then reversing the spin - down that is expected from evolution according to a skumanich - type magnetic braking law .",
    "the observed rotation periods are irreconcilable with such an evolution of the rotation period , and strongly suggest that falling in hot jupiters cause their host stars to spin up during their inward , tidal interaction governed migration .",
    "it is worth noting that the our results seem to point toward a more diverse range of stellar tidal dissipation strength than is commonly considered in the literature .",
    "the ranges of @xmath74 that we have attributed to the two systems investigated herein are slightly disparate , for which there may be several possible explanations .",
    "we turn to the work of @xcite , which shows that the mass of the convective zone is a function of @xmath107 , and therefore of spectral type . from their fig.1",
    ", we note that the effective temperature of wasp-18a lies close to the point at which the mass of the convective zone becomes negligible , implying a convective zone mass of @xmath349@xmath102 .",
    "wasp-19a , with its much lower effective temperature , would have @xmath350@xmath102 . in our work",
    "we have assumed that the star rotates as a single body , but we have made no assumption about where the majority of tidal dissipation takes place .",
    "if this process occurs in the convective zone then the discrepancy in the masses , and therefore depths , of the convective zones of the two stars could provide an explanation for the disagreement as to the value of @xmath0 , with a larger convective zone allowing for more efficient dissipation and hence a smaller quality factor .",
    "this study also provides a warning against using gyrochronology to estimate the ages of hot jupiter host stars . owing to the tidal spin - up of its host star by the in - falling planet",
    ", the age that we have found for the wasp-19 planetary system is greater than the age found using gyrochronology alone .",
    "the situation for the wasp-18 system is less clear cut , but there is no doubt that gyrochronology will not provide an accurate estimate of the system age at all points during its evolution .",
    "we therefore suggest that care should be taken when applying gyrochronology to hot jupiter systems .",
    "the two systems studied herein are extreme examples of this class of planet , with extremely short orbital periods and very close orbits .",
    "it is likely that there will be a critical point in semi - major axis space , beyond which tidal interactions will be sufficiently weak so as not to influence the stellar rotation period . for systems in this region gyrochronology may well work very well .",
    "but for systems such as wasp-18 and wasp-19 which have @xmath351 , gyrochronology should be applied with care .",
    "determination of this critical point will require further work , and it is likely to depend on a host of factors .",
    "@xcite also suggests that gyrochronology may not always provide accurate age estimates for exoplanetary systems , finding that plotting @xmath352 as a function of @xmath107 for planet hosting stars gives a poor fit to the period - colour relation of @xcite .",
    "this implies that exoplanet host stars are systematically faster rotators than stars with similar ages and properties that do not appear to have any associated planets .",
    "@xcite also finds that the rotation period evolution of f- and g - type planet hosts does not differ substantially from similar stars without hot jupiters , a conclusion with which we disagree although we note that the final spiral - in of the planet does not appear to have been considered .",
    "the substantially reduced rotation period that results from tidal spin - up may provide a means of detecting stars that have either been planet hosts in the past , or that have unseen planetary companions that are in the process of spiraling in to the roche limit .",

    "<S> we investigate the effects of tidal interactions on the planetary orbits and stellar spin rates of the wasp-18 and wasp-19 planetary systems using a forward integration scheme . by fitting the resulting evolutionary tracks to the observed eccentricity , semi - major axis and stellar rotation rate , and to the stellar age derived from isochronal fitting , </S>",
    "<S> we are able to place constraints on the stellar and planetary reduced tidal quality factors , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for wasp-18 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , implying a system age of @xmath4gyr . for wasp-19 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , suggesting a system age of @xmath7gyr and a remaining lifetime of @xmath8gyr . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate a range of evolutionary histories consistent with these results and the observed parameters for both systems , and find that the majority imply that the stars have been spun up through tidal interactions as the planets spiral towards their roche limits . </S>",
    "<S> we examine a variety of evidence for wasp-19a s age , both for the value above and for a younger age consistent with gyrochronology , and conclude that the older estimate is more likely to be correct . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that wasp-19b might be in the final stages of the spiral - in process , although we are unable to rule out the possibility that it has a substantial remaining lifetime .    </S>",
