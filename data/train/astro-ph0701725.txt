    "one of the fundamental open questions in cosmology is when did galaxies form their first generations of stars ? identifying and studying such galaxies are key steps towards understanding the physical processes that drive galaxy formation . probing the formation and early growth of systems similar to the milky way requires observations of galaxies when the universe is still young . specifically , theoretical calculations @xcite predict that the most rapid growth of galaxies with masses comparable to that of the milky way occurs at redshifts of approximately z@xmath05 .",
    "this is not long after the end of the ( complex ) reionisation process , which recent three - year wmap results indicate was underway at z@xmath011 @xcite and was largely complete by redshifts z@xmath06 - 6.5 @xcite .",
    "estimates of the ionising photon density in the early universe suggests that the uv emission from currently known high redshift galaxies , whether star - formation or agn dominated , is insufficient to have caused reionisation .",
    "however , these galaxies must have had an impact on the intergalactic medium at high redshift . only through comprehensive studies of the physical properties ( including masses , star formation rates and histories , and clustering strength ) of galaxies that were in place at this epoch ,",
    "can we accurately assess their contribution to the mass growth of galaxies like our own , and their effect on the gaseous intergalactic medium ( igm ) at the end of reionisation .    as part of an ongoing study of high redshift galaxies",
    ", we have investigated the rest - frame uv - optical properties of candidate lbgs at 4.6@xmath11z@xmath116 selected as v - dropouts using the now standard lyman - break technique @xcite . through spectroscopic confirmation",
    ", we have successfully demonstrated the efficacy of this technique for unambiguously identifying z@xmath05  galaxies from deep imaging surveys in the rest - frame uv using 8m - class telescopes @xcite . from these data it has been possible to determine the comoving density @xcite , the likely contribution to the end of reionisation @xcite , and the fraction of sources which host super - massive black holes @xcite of z@xmath05  lbgs",
    ". however , the rest - frame uv data alone are thus far insufficient to accurately constrain the ages , dust content , star formation rates and masses of the lbg population at high redshift .",
    "rather , accurately constraining these parameters relies on well measured rest - frame uv - to - optical seds . at z@xmath05 ,",
    "the rest - frame uv emission from ongoing star - formation is redshifted into the observed visible , while emission in the rest - frame visible to near - infrared from older stars , diagnostic of longer or earlier periods of star formation , shifts into the mid - infrared .",
    "several fields now have excellent multi - wavelength data sets from both the hubble and spitzer space telescopes ( hst and spitzer , respectively ) , supplemented by ground - based data sets , forming an ideal basis for selecting and studying samples of distant galaxies across the full rest - frame uv to visible wavelength range .",
    "the most detailed multiwavelength studies to date of 5@xmath3z@xmath37 lbgs have been centered upon a small fraction of dropouts that benefit from amplification due to lensing and/or those detected with spitzer - irac @xcite . since , at z@xmath125",
    ", the balmer - break lies between the @xmath13 and the irac pass - bands , the irac data are highly effective in constraining the ages of these systems .",
    "a strong detection with irac normally confirms the presence of a balmer break or an intrinsically more uv luminous system .",
    "the derived properties of these high redshift lbgs are fascinating ; massive ( few - several @xmath810@xmath9@xmath7 ) and strongly star forming systems with ages comparable to the age of the universe at that epoch .",
    "the presence of such massive and evolved systems at high redshift , in place less than a billion years after the big bang , challenges the expectations from bottom - up hierarchical structure formation scenarios ( however , also see * ? ? ?",
    "these derived masses and ages of z@xmath105 lbgs are similar to the average properties of lbgs at redshift 3 . following the pioneering work of steidel et al . , the last decade has seen intensive observational and theoretical studies on the properties of lbgs at z@xmath03 , providing a wealth of information about this abundant population of uv - bright galaxies at this epoch .",
    "these star - formation dominated systems are seen to host strong outflows @xcite , typically have sub - solar - to - solar metallicities ( @xmath50.3 - 1z@xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and possibly contain a significant component of metal - free ( population iii ) stars @xcite .",
    "lbgs are shown to be highly clustered on both large and small scales , the latter being indicative of common halo objects @xcite .",
    "recent follow - up of z@xmath03  lbgs with spitzer has revealed a division in the population between lbgs with significant dust - attenuated star - forming regions as well as the uv - emitting ones @xcite .",
    "this division is also seen for lbgs at z@xmath01 with 40 per cent being infrared bright .",
    "recently @xcite have reported on the potential relation between uv- and ir selected populations .",
    "suggest ir - luminous lbgs are the missing link between lbgs and sub - mm galaxies and are the progenitors of present - day giant ellipticals ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but how do these properties compare to those samples of lbgs at higher redshifts ?",
    "do we see an evolution in the properties of similar lbgs at these two epochs ?",
    "because of the small number of sources investigated , and the inhomogeneity of the selection criteria used , it has not yet been possible to consistently compare the derived properties of z@xmath105 lbgs directly with those of lyman - break galaxies at z@xmath03 . in a preliminary study , @xcite find that unlike z@xmath03  lbgs @xcite the majority of luminous z@xmath05 - 6 lbgs have weak or absent lyman alpha ( ly@xmath15 ) emission and strong low - ionisation absorption lines , already indicating key differences between the populations at redshift 5 and redshift 3 .",
    "we complement this comparison by analysing the properties of a large and reliable sample of the most luminous lbgs ( l@xmath16l * ) at z@xmath05  which match the luminosity to which lbgs at redshift 3 have been spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "this matched selection permits a direct comparison between the properties of similarly luminous lbgs in place in a @xmath51.2@xmath2  old universe and those at redshift 3 , @xmath51@xmath2  later .",
    "this difference is longer than the typical duration of the uv luminous phase of a z@xmath03  lbg , thus we are not comparing the same galaxies , but galaxies at two epochs with similar uv - emission characteristics .    to address these issues ,",
    "we present the results from an analysis of the properties of a sample of luminous v - band dropouts selected from the multiwavelength datasets of the chandra deep field south ( cdfs , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this field was chosen as the southern field of the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for which public imaging data are available over ten bands covering the optical ( hst - acs ) , near - infrared ( vlt - isaac ) and mid - infrared ( spitzer - irac ) wavelength ranges . in section [ sample ]",
    "we describe our methodology and selection criteria that define this robust sample of z@xmath05  lbgs .",
    "the stellar evolutionary modelling is discussed in section [ model ] .",
    "the resultant physical properties of mass , ages , star formation rate and extinction of the galaxies in this sample are detailed in section [ results ] and the comparison to the properties of z@xmath03  galaxies is presented in section [ comp ] . unlike similarly luminous z@xmath03  lbgs , and other z@xmath165 lbg samples , we find our sample to be dominated by young ( @xmath3100@xmath4 ) and moderately massive ( @xmath17@xmath7 ) galaxies .",
    "we discuss the implications of our findings in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we adopt the following flat cosmology throughout this paper : @xmath18=70kms@xmath19mpc@xmath19 , @xmath20=0.3 , @xmath21=0.7 .",
    "all magnitudes are based on the ab magnitude system @xcite .",
    "we applied a lyman - break colour selection to the publicly available hst / advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) imaging datasets of the cdfs obtained through the filters f435w ( _ b _ ) , f606w ( _ v _ ) , f775w ( _ i _ ) and f850lp ( _ z _ ) @xcite .",
    "specifically , we selected objects with @xmath22-@xmath23mag which were not detected ( signal - to - noise ratio @xmath3 3 ) in the f435w ( @xmath24-band ) image ( i.e. short - ward of the 912  lyman - break at z@xmath05 ) ensuring that we only selected sources with a clear lyman discontinuity in their emission .",
    "we then required that the objects were reliably detected ( signal - to - noise ratio @xmath12 5 in the @xmath25-band ) in order to accurately measure the sizes of the uv emitting regions .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned above , we matched our sample to the magnitude limit to which lbgs at z@xmath03  have been spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "this limit of @xmath26@xmath525.5 probes z@xmath03  lbgs brighter than @xmath27l*@xmath28 @xcite . at redshift z@xmath05",
    "@xmath26@xmath525.5 corresponds to @xmath29@xmath526.3mag , the magnitude to which we select our sample of z@xmath05  lbgs .",
    "this colour selection is similar to those previously used to select @xmath30-band dropouts ( or the analogous @xmath31-band dropouts in @xcite , but see also @xcite for a discussion of alternative colour cuts ) , which have been successfully spectroscopically confirmed to lie at z@xmath05@xcite .      for each object",
    "we combined the acs data with publicly available near- and mid - infrared datasets to construct multi - wavelength seds covering 0.45 to 8@xmath32 m ( figure [ fig : seds ] ) .",
    "the ground - based @xmath33- and @xmath34-band data were taken with isaac at the very large telescope ( vlt ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and http://www.eso.org/science/goods/imaging/products.html ) , and the mid - infrared data with spitzer / irac at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.6 and 8.0@xmath32 m ( dickinson et al . , in prep . and http://data.spitzer.caltech.edu/popular/goods/ , see also brief descriptions in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "while we used the publicly - available reduced images for the acs and isaac data , we performed post - pipeline processing on the goods - s / spitzer data ( from epochs 1 and 2 ) creating deep 1@xmath81  mosaics centered on each high redshift candidate using the spitzer / mopex package .",
    "the resultant drizzled mosaics have had instrumental effects and cosmic ray events removed .",
    "the mosaics were registered to the acs astrometric reference frame using common detections to an accuracy of @xmath50.1  .",
    "we verified our irac mosaic generation and photometric calibration by performing the same procedure to extract photometry for a and f stars identified in the field .",
    "such stars rarely show an infrared excess or have strong absorption features in the mid - infrared , thereby enabling accurate predictions of their mid - infrared emission .",
    "the fluxes predicted by black - body fits to the templates of their spectral types were reproduced to within 0.1 , 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.3mag of our aperture photometry at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8@xmath32 m , respectively , consistent with our adopted accuracies ( see later for a description of our adopted photometric uncertainties ) .",
    "additionally , we confirmed that our measured fluxes were consistent with those measured for our lbg candidates and the stars from the epoch 1 and 2 goods enhanced legacy products ( dickinson et al .",
    ", in prep .",
    "and http://data.spitzer.caltech.edu/popular/goods/ ) .",
    "the deep goods / irac data have the largest spatial pixels and psfs amongst our datasets and , as a result , in crowded regions the emission profile from a given source can overlap with those of adjacent sources . for those sources selected according to the above criteria , but blended with neighbours in the spitzer data , we treated the mid - infrared irac fluxes as upper limits in the subsequent sed analysis .",
    "cc +   &   +   &   +   &   +    for each source that satisfied our lyman break criteria , we built a 10-band sed with fixed diameter aperture photometry performed on each image ( see figure [ fig : seds ] ) .",
    "apertures , appropriate for the characteristics of each image , were determined based on enclosing as large a fraction of the source flux as possible while minimising the impact of the sky background noise and flux contributions from neighbouring sources .",
    "we used apertures with diameters of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for the measurements on the acs , isaac , and irac images , respectively .",
    "small aperture correction factors were applied to account for the fraction of the total flux not enclosed by our fixed - diameter apertures : 1.07 for the four acs bands , 1.10 for the two isaac bands , 1.18 for the irac 3.6 and @xmath38 bands , and 1.35 and 1.47 for the 5.8 and @xmath39 bands .",
    "we determined the aperture corrections based on the point spread function ( psf ) of each mosaic , constructed from isolated , bright but unsaturated stars throughout the cdf - s and taking reference total apertures of diameters @xmath40 for the optical and near - infrared data , and @xmath41 for the mid - infrared data .",
    "the formal uncertainty assigned to each photometric data point was derived from measuring the background fluctuations in the parent image using @xmath510@xmath42 - 10@xmath43 synthetic apertures with fixed diameters laid down at random on regions that are empty of flux from discrete sources , thereby accurately characterising the photometric uncertainty directly from the data , rather than calculating it from the pixel - to - pixel rms assuming uncorrelated gaussian noise statistics .",
    "the simulations were performed for a range of aperture diameters . as a function of linear aperture size @xmath44",
    ", the empirically derived relationship shows that the photometric uncertainties lie above and grow faster with size than the @xmath45 dependence for pure gaussian noise .",
    "however , for a given aperture size , the histogram of background fluxes is very well described by a gaussian distribution ( of which the dispersion is taken as the @xmath46 uncertainty for photometric measurements in the given aperture size ) .",
    "a conservative absolute calibration uncertainty of ten per cent was additionally included in the final adopted uncertainty to comfortably account for the relative uncertainties in photometric calibration across the ten bands . in our sed modelling ,",
    "this additional uncertainty prevents the fits being driven by a few photometric points with very small errors .",
    "we note that adopting a less conservative value for this uncertainty would mainly act to reduce the range of acceptable older ages , which is most influenced by the irac photometry , and therefore would not alter our findings of young ages for the majority of our sources .",
    "our initial rest - frame uv selection yielded a sample of 109 z@xmath05  lbg candidates .",
    "this sample will include a fraction of spurious sources that are not lbgs ( low redshift galaxies , quasars and stars ) and also some sources with insufficient photometric constraints ( regardless of their nature ) to reliably determine their properties .",
    "we have therefore culled the inital sample as follows .    assisted by seds extending to the observed - frame mid - infrared ,",
    "we have reliably excluded 22 candidates from our sample which are low redshift galaxies ( or interlopers ) .",
    "synthesis modelling of the colour evolution of stellar populations predicts that galaxies with z@xmath474 can also satisfy our uv selection criteria .",
    "these galaxies have intrinsically redder near and mid - infrared seds than true high redshift lyman break galaxies .",
    "the sed of an example interloper is shown in panel ( vii ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : seds ] and is easily distinguished from the seds of high redshift lbgs ( panel ii - vi ) .",
    "furthermore , figure [ fig : seds ] demonstrates how the addition of the irac data has greatly enhanced our ability to screen for such low redshift galaxies which are generally the brightest sources in the irac wavelengths that satisfy our optical selection criteria .",
    "these interlopers mostly satisfy the criterion for being extremely red objects ( ero , @xmath482.48 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and irac - selected eros ( iero , @xmath4920 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , consistent with being galaxies at z@xmath01 - 2 .",
    "the importance of this screening is clear when one considers that most samples of systems satisfying the high - redshift lbg selection criteria distinctly lack confirmatory spectroscopy and several of the recently reported irac - detected modelled z@xmath165 lbgs do not have confirmed spectroscopic redshifts @xcite . in the case of the z@xmath06 lbg in @xcite ,",
    "an interloper solution is more plausible @xcite .",
    "our initial optical selection potentially includes low mass stars within the galaxy and qsos .",
    "these are spatially unresolved in the acs data are therefore straightforwardly excluded .",
    "we identified 19 such objects .",
    "these objects generally have the brightest visible emission amongst the systems that satisfy our selection criteria ( @xmath5023 ) .",
    "@xcite obtained spectra of four of these objects with sufficient quality for them to be classified as stars , supporting the exclusion of unresolved objects from our robust sample .",
    "had we included them and subjected them to synthesis modelling , their best - fit models would imply implausibly high star formation rates and young ages .",
    "thus , without screening for these objects , our derived ensemble properties would be heavily biased towards young ages and high star formation rates .    finally , as accurate estimates of the ages , masses and star - formation histories of our galaxies are dependent upon well - sampled seds , it is imperative to analyse the objects with the most robust photometry . therefore , we additionally excluded the results from 47 sources with secure detections in only two or three bands ( including @xmath51 and @xmath25 ) , with the remaining constraints being upper limits .",
    "there are insufficient data to constrain the models to accurately constrain their physical properties , and these systems are flagged as having insufficient photometry. a significant fraction of these systems are blended with a nearby source in the irac bands . because blending is purely a random alignment of foreground sources with our high redshift candidates",
    ", there is no reason these should be different to the isolated candidates .",
    "accordingly , we do not find any evidence for a systematic difference in the derived properties of the blended and isolated sub - samples .",
    "we note that this step may preferentially exclude lbgs with high star formation rates , low masses and young ages as these are less likely to be detected in the irac bands .",
    "massive , old lbgs selected at the same @xmath52band magnitude as younger ,",
    "lower mass systems are intrinsically brighter in the observed ir and so require more of the photometric bands to be compromised in order to exclude them in this way .",
    "this culling process renders a final robust sample of 21 galaxies which is the focus of our study .",
    "since each step in the culling process ( apart from the last ) is unbiased with respect to the physical properties of our high redshift galaxies , the final robust sample is expected to be representative of the bright , z@xmath05  galaxy population selected by the lyman - break technique , with the possibility that the lower mass and younger systems may be underrepresented .",
    "the use of the longer wavelength near- and mid - infrared data have enabled us to construct a uniformly selected rest - frame uv sample that is reliable .",
    "figure [ fig : histo ] shows the magnitude distribution of the robust sample in comparison to all objects satisfying our selection criteria and the culled members . as expected , we find that the star / qso candidates and low - redshift galaxies are in the most part the brightest sources that satisfy our initial selection criteria .",
    "the histograms of the robust sample and the lbg candidates flagged as having insufficient - photometry suggest that the former comprises the brighter members of the z@xmath05  population and the latter the fainter members . indeed",
    "6 lbgs from the robust sample , and 9 candidates with insufficient photometry , have been spectroscopically confirmed to be z@xmath05  lbgs .",
    "-band magnitude distributions of the full set of 109 objects satisfying the initial selection criteria , with histograms of the comprising sub - samples overlaid .",
    "the black / shaded histogram represents the final robust sample of reliable lbg candidates.,width=321 ]",
    "using a library of synthetic spectra @xcite , we modelled the sed of each lbg candidate simultaneously deriving photometric redshifts and the key properties of age , extinction , star formation rate and stellar mass .",
    "we explored a range of star formation histories ( constant star formation rate , instantaneous burst , and exponentially decaying star formation rates with @xmath53-folding timescales ranging from 10@xmath4  to 1@xmath2 ) .",
    "the uv emission from galaxies is dominated by the population of short - lived massive ob and a stars .",
    "models of continuous star formation enable the production of these massive stars even at old ages .",
    "in contrast , massive stars die away rapidly in an instantaneous burst model and conspicuous uv emission is only produced at very young ages . for a given initial mass function ( imf ) , model fits with these two star formation histories will bracket the possible age range of the galaxies .",
    "our emphasis on the constant star formation model therefore provides upper limits to the best - fit stellar ages . for this reason we concentrate our analysis on the results obtained for a constant star formation rate .",
    "the effects of adopting alternative star formation histories on our results are discussed in appendix [ alt ] .    for all of our models",
    ", we used a salpeter stellar imf between 0.1 and 100@xmath7 .",
    "the actual imf is unconstrained for our objects .",
    "a steep rise down to the lower mass cutoff likely is unrealistic in view of the turnover below 1@xmath7  inferred for the local imf , and recent comparisons of dynamical masses and photometric stellar masses suggest that kroupa / chabrier - type imfs would be more appropriate at higher redshift as well .",
    "the main impact of changing the imf on our sed modelling is on the derived masses and star formation rates which , for a given rest - frame v - band luminosity , would be about a factor of 1.4 - 2 lower with the @xcite or @xcite imfs ( ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( see also the discussion by * ? ? ?",
    "* in the context of sed modelling of z@xmath03  lbgs ) ) . at z@xmath102 , and",
    "more so at z@xmath05 , top - heavy imfs with a larger proportion of massive ( @xmath54@xmath7 ) stars , or even extremely massive ( @xmath55@xmath7 ) metal - free stars formed from primordial gas ( `` population iii '' stars ) may be an issue .",
    "if so , using such an imf in the modelling would lead to a reduction of the derived stellar masses and sfrs .",
    "we adopted @xcite models with a metallicity of one - fifth solar and , for consistency , a small magellanic cloud - type ( smc - type ) dust extinction law .",
    "observational constraints on the metallicity of z@xmath05  galaxies are scarce ; however , the metallicities derived from absorption lines in the spectra of eigth z@xmath05  lbgs in the subaru deep field are @xmath56 @xcite , suggesting that our choice of @xmath57 is reasonably representative . for each individual galaxy ,",
    "best - fit parameters were derived from minimisation of the reduced @xmath58 statistic .",
    "all model fitting followed standard procedures applied in similar studies of high redshift galaxies .",
    "we assumed a constant marginalisation for each of the models .",
    "while our results are marginalised over the extinction law , metallicity , star formation history and imf , we have actually explored a range of all of these parameters ( see appendix [ alt ] ) but the results presented correspond to our preferred single values of these properties as described above .",

    "this unlikely high surface density strongly argues against a significant fraction of old stars contributing to the galaxy mass , and suggests that the stellar mass derived from the stellar synthesis modelling is representative of the total mass of the galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , we can place extreme upper limits on the mass contribution of such an old underlying population following a similar procedure to that used for lbgs at z@xmath03@xcite .",
    "this consistent approach allows us to test whether such an old contribution can explain the mass difference we have found which has been discussed in section [ comp ] . for this",
    "we consider an extreme worst case scenario , requiring the coincidence of a ssp which , compared to scenarios of extended star formation , maximizes the mass - to - light ratio of a `` hidden '' component for a given age . for this",
    "we assume the true photometry of the source is in fact at the brightest 1@xmath60 limit of our photometric uncertainties .",
    "these uncertainties already include a generous 10% to account for flux calibration errors .",
    "therefore , the limit that results is extreme and while there is a chance that it can apply to an individual source , it is highly unlikely to be valid for the population as a whole .",
    "we consider the case of a passively evolving component with an age of 500@xmath4 , the median for the one - third of our robust sample older than 100@xmath4 , and comparable to the oldest ages for z@xmath05  lbgs reported by other authors as well .",
    "the sed of a 500@xmath4  old ssp peaks in the rest - frame optical , in particular just red - wards of the balmer/4000  break , and so would contribute most to the observed fluxes in the @xmath13 , @xmath64 , and @xmath38 bands .",
    "we thus determined the upper limit for an old component by adding to the nominal best - fit sed for each object the maximum contribution from a 500  myr old ssp allowed by the @xmath46 uncertainties on the @xmath13 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 photometric points .",
    "the typical maximum contribution corresponds to an increase in flux by a factor of 2.5 and translates into a factor of @xmath66 times more stellar mass .",
    "uncertainties of the photometry . at observed wavelengths",
    "bluer than @xmath13 , the light contribution of the old component becomes much smaller relative to the strong rest - frame uv emission from the young stars .",
    "compared to the @xmath67@xmath68  and @xmath69@xmath68  data , the @xmath70 and @xmath39 photometry does not provide useful limits because of significantly lower sensitivity and larger uncertainties . ]",
    "however this factor must not be taken at face value .",
    "the assumption of a 500@xmath4  - to maximally - old passively evolving population formed in an instantaneous burst , made to maximise the mass - to - light ratio , is more extreme than any detected population .",
    "any scenario with an old component that has been forming stars for some non - negligible period of time , even if short , will reduce this upper limit . and considering our conservative photometric uncertainties , an upper limit to the mass contributions for our z@xmath05  lbgs will be considerably less than this .",
    "similar factors have been determined for z@xmath03  lbgs ( 3 - 5 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore such a potential contribution from old stars would be insufficient to make the mass ranges shown in section [ comp ] of the sample overlap ."
