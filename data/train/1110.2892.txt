    "it is also evident from the figure that star formation is much more intermittent in the case with radiation feedback ( run  b ) .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that the star formation process is controlled by the local jeans mass , which depends to a large degree on how the filaments in the disk shield the radiation .",
    "shielding can lower the jeans mass temporarily and thereby allow gravitational collapse that would not have occurred otherwise .",
    "since the accretion heating raises the jeans mass and length in run  b , the total number of sink particles is higher in run  d than in run  b , and the stars in run  d generally reach a lower mass than in run  b. these two effects cancel out to lead to the same overall star formation rate for some time ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) . at one point in the evolution , however , also the total accretion rate of run  b drops below that of run  d. at time @xmath37myr the accretion flow around the most massive star has attenuated below the value required to trap the h  ii  region .",

    "the accretion rate in these multiple sink simulations is generally higher than in the single sink run  a since the large group of sinks accretes from a large volume , without needing to rely on outward angular momentum transport to deliver material to the direct feeding zone of the central sink . in the magnetized run  e , no secondary sink particles form during the first @xmath27kyr , so that the increased accretion rate in this phase is due to the additional angular momentum transport performed by the magnetic field .",
    "after the initial @xmath27kyr , the total accretion rate in run  e falls below run  b and the control run  d , deviating increasingly with time , but always staying above the accretion rate in run  a. the accretion histories of run  b and run  d only start to separate at relatively late time when the ionizing radiation begins to terminate accretion onto the most massive sinks in run  b ( see the discussion in @xcite ) , but the magnetic field additionally reduces the rate at which gas collapses in run  e. thus , the total accretion rate with magnetic fields is lower than without magnetic fields .",
    "the central star in run  e can grow to larger masses because in the initial phase fragmentation is delayed by magnetic support .",
    "this allows the central object to maintain a high accretion rate for a longer time .",
    "nevertheless , the accretion rate of the massive star in run  e drops significantly when secondary sink particles form , since they form in a dense ring around the central massive sink and to some extent starve it of material , even though they never cut off accretion entirely .    the stronger initial accretion phase in run  e compared to run  b yields the main contribution to the larger final mass of the massive sink .",
