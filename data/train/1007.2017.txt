    "quasars represent episodes of rapid supermassive black hole ( smbh ) growth and probably a unique period in the early evolution of galaxies .",
    "they may directly follow a major merger @xcite or a big blowout of gas and dust .",
    "however , the nature of the relationship between smbh growth and galaxy formation is not well understood .",
    "feedback from quasar outflows may play an important role in the evolution of this relationship .",
    "we are using narrow absorption lines ( nals ) in quasar spectra to study quasar outflows and environments across a range of scales .",
    "nals have full widths at half minimum ( fwhms ) less than several hundred  km  s@xmath1 , and they appear in a variety of ultraviolet ( uv ) resonance transitions , including c  iv  @xmath01548 and  @xmath01551 , n  v  @xmath01239 and  @xmath01243 , c  iii  @xmath0977 , si  iv  @xmath01394 and  @xmath01402 and ly @xmath9  @xmath01216 , ly@xmath10  @xmath01026 , ly@xmath11  @xmath0973 , ly@xmath12  @xmath0950 , and ly@xmath13  @xmath0938 @xcite .",
    "the first step in using these absorption lines to study the quasar environment is to determine simply where the lines form .",
    "there are several possibilities , including unrelated ( intervening ) clouds and galaxies which happen to lie in the line - of - sight , nearby cluster galaxies and intrinsic clouds within the quasar host galaxy and its extended environment @xcite .",
    "the statistical excess of c  iv  nals at velocity shifts v  @xmath14  km  s@xmath1 , where negative v indicates motion towards the observer , indicates that many of these absorbers are directly related to quasar environments @xcite .",
    "the excess is largest at v  @xmath15  km  s@xmath1 , where roughly 80% of c  iv  systems with rest equivalent width rew(1548 )  @xmath16    have a quasar  related origin @xcite . this intrinsic gas can form in quasar  driven outflows , starburst  driven outflows , merger remnants or ambient gas in the host halos , or in other galaxy halos in the same galaxy cluster as the quasar . at higher velocities , the excess can be attributed directly to quasar  driven outflows . in the velocity range -1000 to -12,000  km  s@xmath1 ,",
    "@xcite estimate that @xmath17  43% of c  iv  nals with rew(1548 )  @xmath18  0.3    originate in a quasar outflow .",
    "nals encompass a wealth of information about the basic properties of quasar outflows , which we use to gain insights into the outflow physics , acceleration mechanisms and geometry of the near quasar environment .",
    "nals represent a very different type of quasar outflow compared to the well - studied much broader and higher velocity broad absorption lines ( bals ) , but they might simply be different manifestations of a single outflow phenomenon viewed at different angles @xcite .",
    "the nals that do not form in outflows probe the gaseous environments of quasars more generally , and can be used to examine conditions in different host galaxies environments such as starburst  driven outflows or larger - scale gas distributions produced by messy mergers .",
    "we are involved in a program to study the location , origin and abundance information for absorbers in a sample of high redshift quasars .",
    "we are particularly interested in high redshift quasars because z  @xmath19 is the cosmic era when host galaxies are thought to grow rapidly and form most of their stars , possibly through merger events @xcite .",
    "choosing redshifts above z  @xmath20  2.73 also allows us to measure lines at shorter rest - frame wavelengths with ground  based telescopes , including importantly , the h  i  lyman series , in order to obtain more and better constraints on the absorber ionisations , column densities and metal abundance .",
    "we are interested in using abundances to discern rough star formation histories of quasar host galaxies in order to make inferences about the relationship between the quasar , the growth of the central black hole , and the evolution of the host galaxy .",
    "broad emission lines ( bels ) have been used most often to study quasar abundances .",
    "the most reliable results suggest metallicities of at least solar , and up to a few times solar , which requires significant previous star formation in the host @xcite . the metal - rich bel result is true even for",
    "the highest redshifts studied , e.g. @xcite , with redshifts out to 6.4 .",
    "the most reliable results based on bal column densities suggest metallicity ranges between solar and ten times solar @xcite .",
    "previous studies of nals in low redshift samples have found super - solar metallicities and highly ionised gas , and have successfully probed several other nal outflow characteristics @xcite .",
    "these lower redshift samples cover a wide range of luminosities , observed in the ultraviolet ( uv ) spectral range , where many useful metal and hydrogen lines occur .",
    "nals offer certain advantages in the study of metallicities and other gas characteristics in the near - quasar environment .",
    "their narrow widths mean the c  iv  doublets , separated by 500  km  s@xmath1 , are resolved .",
    "we use resolved absorption line doublets to disentangle saturation effects , and to obtain accurate line optical depth and column density measurements .",
    "nals also form in a range of physical locations , providing a more complete picture of the regions near quasars . because the nal methods are completely independent from the bel methods , requiring only column densities and ionisation corrections , the nal metallicities provide an independent test of the bel results .    here",
    "we present results for the particular luminous quasar j102325.31 + 514251.0 ( hereafter j1023 + 5142 ) at a redshift of @xmath21 , which is during the peak in quasar activity and the epoch of rapid galaxy formation .",
    "this quasar contains a rich complex of nine distinct c  iv  nal systems at velocities from -1400 to -6200  km  s@xmath1 . the density and diversity of lines in this complex merits special attention .",
    "we will argue below that most ( or all ) of these systems form in a highly structured quasar ",
    "driven outflow .    to interprete the metallicities and other data provided by these nals , we examine several diagnostics that can identify intrinsic nals that form in quasar ",
    "driven outflows @xcite . in particular , 1 ) variability studies have found intrinsic absorbers varying on relatively short timescales of months to years , providing strong evidence for these absorbers belonging to outflows either crossing the line of sight to the quasar or experiencing changing ionisation with the variations in the continuum emission @xcite .",
    "2 ) detection of partial coverage of the background light source along the line of sight strongly implies gas forming very near the source .",
    "this phenomenon occurs when the absorbing clouds are smaller than the background source , allowing part of the light from the source to reach the observer unabsorbed .",
    "this partial covering is easily detected in multiplets like the c  iv  doublet where the optical depth ratio between the two lines is fixed by the oscillator strengths .",
    "when the source is partially covered , some light fills in the bottom of the absorption line , and makes the apparent optical depth ratio appear different than the real optical depth ratio .",
    "3 ) outflow lines tend to have profiles that are broad and smooth compared to thermal widths @xcite . in well studied nals , these three indicators ( variability , partial covering and broad profiles ) tend to appear together , which further increases the probability that the occurrence of an individual indicator accurately predicts an outflow origin very near the quasar for a given absorption line ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we also note that super ",
    "solar metallicities are consistent with an intrinsic origin for the gas .",
    "there are examples of high  metallicity gas in intervening systems , but not of low",
    " metallicity intrinsic gas @xcite .",
    "we describe the data acquisition and reduction in   [ sec : obs ] , the identification and fitting of the absorption lines in   [ subsec : id ] and [ subsec : fit ] and the abundance and ionisation analysis in   [ sec : ion ] .",
    "we briefly describe individual absorption line systems in   [ sec : sys ] .",
    "we discuss the arguments for the locations , probable intrinsic origins and quasar  driven outflow properties of the gas in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] and conclude with a summary in   [ sec : sum ] .",
    "we observed the quasar j1023 + 5142 on march 29 , 2007 with the keck i hiresr echelle spectrograph as part of an observing campaign to measure spectra of high redshift quasars with known narrow associated absorption lines .",
    "we used an 0.86 wide slit for a spectral resolution of r  @xmath22 or velocity resolution of @xmath23  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "our data span the wavelength range from 3700 to 8100    corresponding to 830 to 1820   in the quasar rest frame .",
    "this spectral range covers a variety of interesting lines , including rest - frame ly  @xmath24   , c  iv  1548 , 1551    and several other lines in the h  i  lyman series down to the lyman limit at 912   .",
    "we use four exposures totalling 2 hours on the source .",
    "the spectral region from @xmath25 to @xmath26    is well - covered with considerable overlap between echelle orders at some wavelengths , but above 6540    there are small 15 - 40    gaps between orders ( one such gap is apparent in figure  [ fig : civ ] ) , and two larger gaps at 4980 - 5070    and 6575 - 6670    where the spectrum falls into a physical gap between detectors .",
    "we reduce all the data using the makee hires data reduction package .",
    "the spectra are sky background - subtracted and extracted from the 2d frame with a low order polynomial trace using a white dwarf standard observed the previous night with similar seeing conditions .",
    "we use a thorium argon ( thar ) lamp spectrum for wavelength calibration .",
    "the resulting spectra are on a vacuum and heliocentric wavelength scale .",
    "the spectra are not absolute flux calibrated .",
    "we normalise the spectra to unity by fitting a pseudo - continuum to all of the quasar emission , including the emission lines .",
    "the pseudo - continuum is defined as follows : for regions with few absorption lines , we apply a polynomial fit to the local continuum in each echelle order .",
    "we accomplish the continuum normalisation in crowded regions where the continuum is affected by significant absorption , e.g. the ly @xmath9  forest , by first averaging together several adjacent spectral orders into a single spectrum .",
    "then , we visually inspect the region for small sections of continuum not affected by absorption or obvious noise spikes , and interpolate between these sections , fitting the entire region with a low order polynomial .",
    "our continuum fit for a region of the ly @xmath9 forest containing the ly@xmath10 and o  vi  nals is shown in figure  [ fig : contin ] .",
    "the continuum placement has an uncertainty of @xmath27% in the forest and 2 - 3% at other wavelengths .",

    ", width=302 ]",
    "the broad , flat shape of the emission features in the spectrum of j1023 + 5142 make an accurate emission redshift difficult to determine . the redshift provided by the sdss spectrum is @xmath21 .",
    "we estimate the reliability of this value by measuring the redshifts of the c  iv  @xmath01549 , c  iii ]  @xmath01909 and si  iv+o  iv ]  @xmath01398 emission lines using measurements of their centroids .",
    "we shift each centroid respectively by -824 , -730 and + 36  km  s@xmath1  to correct for known offsets from the nominal quasar redshift ( [ o iii ]  @xmath05007 emission ) , based on measurements by @xcite and @xcite for average quasars , where negative values are blueshifts .",
    "the average redshift obtained from these emission lines is @xmath28 , which is offset from the sdss value by @xmath29 or @xmath30  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "these results and our efforts to measure the inherently uncertain emission line centroids suggest that the uncertainty of the redshift measured by sdss is not more than @xmath31 , corresponding to @xmath32  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "we adopt the sdss value throughout the remainder of this paper .",
    "we identify nine distinct c  iv  absorption line systems within 6200  km  s@xmath1  of the quasar redshift .",
    "we will refer to these as systems 19 , as indicated in figure  [ fig : civ ] and table  [ tab : lines ] below .",
    "other c  iv  systems are present at -16,800 and -33,800  km  s@xmath1  in the spectrum , but they have narrow widths , complete covering , and blending problems in the ly @xmath9 forest , which , along with their high velocities , make them likely candidates for intervening gas and exclude them from further analysis in this work .    after identifying the c  iv  doublets , we search the spectrum for other common nals such as si  iv , n  v , c  iii , o  vi , and h  i  lyman series lines at the same redshift",
    ". we also search for lower ionisation species , such as c  ii and si  ii , but find none .",
    "all of the systems , except possibly system 1 , appear to have relatively high ionisations based on the presence and absence of high and low ionisation species respectively .",
    "each set of absorption lines at one redshift is considered a system , as labelled in figure  [ fig : civ ] .",
    "several of these systems are blends of two or three components , which are not individually labelled in the figure .",
    "systems 1 and 2 ( figures  [ fig:1 ] and  [ fig:2 ] ) appear to be line - locked in c  iv .",
    "the velocity offset between the @xmath01548 line in system 1 and the @xmath01551 line in system 2 is remarkably small ( @xmath33  km  s@xmath1 ) compared to the fwhms of these lines ( @xmath34  km  s@xmath1 ) and the velocity shifts from the quasar systemic , @xmath35 and @xmath36  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "if this overlap between the c  iv  lines in systems 1 and 2 represents a physical line - lock , where the velocities of the two systems are actually separated by exactly their doublet separation , and not a chance alignment in the spectrum ( see @xcite and @xcite for full discussions of the possible physical nature of line - locking ) , then it provides evidence for these lines forming in a quasar outflow driven by radiation pressure ( see   [ sec : loc ] below ) .",
    "we fit each nal system with a gaussian optical depth profile .",
    "the narrowest absorption lines are at least 1.5 times broader than the spectral resolution and the other lines are significantly broader than this .",
    "the absorption lines are , therefore , fully resolved , and such gaussian optical depth profile fits are sufficient to determine accurate optical depths and covering fractions .",
    "the optical depths and covering fractions are held constant across the width of each line profile .",
    "gaussian fits are actually essential to distinguish individual absorption features in the crowded ly @xmath9 forest , and also useful to disentangle blended absorption in other areas of the spectrum .",
    "furthermore , gaussian fits smooth over noise spikes and large optical depth and covering fraction uncertainties in the wings of the lines .",
    "we also use gaussian fits to simultaneously fit and lock together various parameters including redshift , doppler @xmath37  parameter , covering fraction and a 2:1 optical depth ratio based on oscillator strength ratios for doublets such as the c  iv , si  iv , n  v , and o  vi .    to measure accurate optical depths",
    ", we must consider the possible effects of partial coverage of the emission source by the absorbing gas .",
    "the line of sight covering fraction affects the observed line intensity as follows :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the velocity dependant line of sight covering fraction , @xmath40 is the emitted ( unabsorbed ) intensity and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the observed intensity and line optical depth at each velocity shift v. this equation assumes that the background light source has a uniform brightness given by i@xmath43 and the foreground absorber is homogeneous with a single value of @xmath42 .",
    "the viability of this assumption is discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assume that all lines in a given multiplet have the same c@xmath44 at a given velocity . we do not explicitly attempt to distinguish between partial covering of the continuum source and of the bel region as discussed by @xcite",
    ". however , we estimate from the sdss spectrum that the c  iv  bel peaks 20% above the continuum , which implies that the bel can only account for partial covering of 0.8 or higher .",
    "we attempt to fit each system with the smallest possible number of gaussian components .",
    "this minimizes the number of free parameters and provides a more robust characterization of column densities , ionisations and abundances in absorbing regions whose internal velocities might be more complex than simple gaussians ( e.g. , in outflows ) .",
    "we fit each absorption line with a single gaussian unless 1 ) the system clearly has multiple components distinguished by inflection points that stand out significantly above the noise fluctuations in the spectrum ( e.g. system 7 ) , or 2 ) a single gaussian would miss a significant fraction , @xmath45% , of the absorption line strength ( e.g. system 4 ) .",
    "the @xmath46% threshold is somewhat arbitrary , but it ensures that we achieve a good fit to the observed line and that significant portions of absorption ( i.e. , large enough to change the column density measurements ) are not missed . for these exceptional cases we use the minimum number of gaussians possible to achieve an accurate fit to the data . if a system is fit with two or more gaussians , each gaussian is labelled as a component .",
    "we assume that the covering fraction is the same for all components in a given system , such that the optical depths in equation  [ eq : cf ] simply add together in regions of component overlap ( see hamann et al . in preparation for further discussion ) .",
    "this simplifying assumption is well justified by the excellent fits to all the systems , with the possible exception of system 6 , which we discuss in more detail in   [ sec : sys ] .",
    "all ions with gaussian fits are shown along with their gaussian optical depth profiles in figures  [ fig:1]-[fig:9 ] .",
    "badly blended members of , e.g. , the lyman - series lines are not used to constrain ionisation or abundance in   [ sec : ion ] and are not shown .",
    "we check the gaussian results using direct integration and point - by - point measurements of @xmath42 and @xmath47 across the line profiles for several systems with either non - gaussian profiles ( system 8) or @xmath48 ( systems 5 and 6 ) as discussed later in this section .",
    "the free parameters in the gaussian fits are @xmath47 , central optical depth , @xmath49 , the doppler @xmath37 parameter , and redshift for each component in each system .",
    "we fit the c  iv  absorption lines first , then base the fit for other absorption lines on the c  iv  fit parameters .",
    "to ensure we are analysing the same gas in different ions , we fix the redshift for all absorption lines in a system to the c  iv  redshift .",
    "we further exclude unwanted contributions from blends or complex multi - phase gas by fixing the @xmath37 parameter of all ions with ionisations lower than c  iv  to that of c  iv .",
    "higher ionisation lines , such as n  v  and o  vi , are allowed to be broader .",
    "however , we cap the @xmath37-values of the h  i  profiles at 140% of c  iv .",
    "this cap is important for the abundance analysis below (   [ sec : ion ] ) because it ensures that the derived h  i  column densities do not include gas with dramatically different kinematics than c  iv .",
    "we choose to cap the h  i  @xmath37-values at 140% of the c  iv  @xmath37-values instead of the much higher percentage expected for purely thermal broadening because the widths of the c  iv  lines exceed the thermal widths expected for a gas photoionised by either the quasar or the inter - galactic uv spectrum .",
    "therefore , we assume the @xmath37-values are dominated by non - thermal broadening effects . on the other hand , setting the cap at 140% instead of something smaller , such as 100% , allows for some contribution of thermal broadening to @xmath37 in the narrower systems ( which would affect h  i  more than c  iv ) .",
    "overall , our fits to the lyman lines should lead to reasonable but generously large estimates of the amount of h  i  gas that coexists with c  iv , and therefore , to conservatively low estimates of the c / h abundance .    as stated above , the covering fraction",
    "is a free parameter in the gaussian optical depth fits of each doublet . in cases where the best fit profile has @xmath48 , we repeat the fit with @xmath50 to test the robustness of the @xmath48 result .",
    "we then compare how well each of the two fits with different values of @xmath47 match the data . in cases",
    "where the fits are comparable , we assume @xmath50 , otherwise , the best fit is chosen .",
    "for example , we confirm that the @xmath48 fit follows the data in systems 5 and 6 , as shown in figure  [ fig:5 + 6 ] , whereas the @xmath50 fit does not match the observed doublet ratios in c  iv  and n  v. we assume @xmath50 for all singlet lines .",
    "the covering fraction for the lyman lines is fixed at the c  iv  doublet covering fraction .",
    "this is necessary because the observed line ratios within the lyman series are too severely affected by blending in the ly @xmath9  forest to yield their own independent measures of @xmath47 .",
    "table  [ tab : lines ] lists fit parameters for all of the absorption lines that yield useful constraints for the ionisation and abundance analysis described in   [ sec : ion ] .",
    "absorption lines that are badly blended are not used in subsequent analysis , and are not listed in the table .",
    "each system is listed separately by redshift and velocity shift , where negative velocities denote gas moving towards the observer .",
    "only the stronger member of the o  vi  doublet is listed , as o  vi  is never used in the abundance analysis because of either line saturation or strong blending in these lines in all systems . however , the strength of o  vi  is still useful as an indicator of the ionisation of the gas . in systems where n  v  is not present , we list upper limits for the stronger member of the n  v  doublet for completeness .",
    "table  [ tab : lines ] lists the central wavelength ( @xmath0 ) and doppler @xmath37 parameter values along with column densities and rest equivalent widths ( rew ) derived from the gaussian optical depth profile fits .",
    "systems 4 and 7 each have two blended components .",
    "the values of @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are listed separately for these components in table  [ tab : lines ] , but the rews , listed only with the first component data , apply to the entire blend .",
    "we measure upper limits on h  i  column densities in all cases where all the lyman series absorption lines are blended with intervening absorption lines in the ly @xmath9 forest .",
    "the same is true for singlet ions with upper limits on the column densities .",
    "we estimate uncertainties for the column densities by placing the continuum at the top and bottom of the noise around the fitted continuum , corresponding to the reasonable maximum / minimum values ( @xmath53 uncertainties ) for continuum placement .",
    "we measure @xmath54 uncertainties for the h  i  column densities of 0.18  dex on average .",
    "the covering fraction is @xmath50 for all the systems , unless otherwise noted in the footnotes of table  [ tab : lines ] , e.g. systems 5 and 6 .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in the covering fraction derived from the gaussian profile fits both formally and informally .",
    "the formal uncertainties are estimated by propagating the error spectrum through the calculation of @xmath47 . however , these uncertainties are much smaller than the informal uncertainties , which are dominated by uncertainty in continuum placement .",
    "we estimate covering fraction uncertainties due to continuum placement uncertainties by first shifting the continuum near each red doublet member up and down by the @xmath55 continuum uncertainty , and then fitting the doublets with this new continuum .",
    "the actual uncertainties are probably smaller than the uncertainties we derive in this way , because a similar shift in the continuum around both doublet members ( a more likely occurrence ) produces smaller changes in @xmath47 .",
    "we find @xmath56 for system 5 and @xmath57 for system 6 .",
    "if we fix the covering fraction in systems 5 and 6 at @xmath50 instead of at the measured values , the column densities in all ions decrease by an average of 0.25  dex .",

    "the abundance ratios can be derived from the ratio of measured column densities corrected for the degree of ionisation in the gas .",
    "for example , the relative carbon to hydrogen abundance normalised to solar is given by :    @xmath66=\\log\\left(\\frac{n({c~\\textsc{iv}})}{n(h i)}\\right ) + \\log\\left(\\frac{f(h i)}{f({c~\\textsc{iv}})}\\right ) + \\left[\\frac{h}{c}\\right]_{\\sun } \\label{eq : c / h}\\ ] ]    where @xmath67 is the ionisation fraction of a given ion , @xmath68 is the column density and the final term on the right - hand side is the logarithmic solar abundance ratio of hydrogen to carbon listed in @xcite .",

    "ideally , we would constrain the absorber ionisations by comparing the ratios of observed column densities in different ions of the same element , such as @xmath69 or @xmath70 , to the theoretical results in @xcite . however , these constraints are only marginally usable in our data because @xmath71 and @xmath72 are always blended in the ly @xmath9 forest and are therefore only ever constrained as upper limits .",

    "the minimum ionisation corrections provide firm lower limits on the abundances that do not depend on the ionisation uncertainties or the possibility of a multi  phase gas .",

    "nonetheless , these outflow fractions support the idea that most or all of the systems in this group of nine nals in j1023 + 5142 form in a quasar outflow .",
    "we search for direct signatures of quasar outflow origin via 1 ) line variability , 2 ) partial covering and 3 ) broad profiles ( see @xcite and references therein for more discussion ) .",

    "these profiles , therefore , exhibit morphologies consistent with formation in an outflow .",

    "one well studied nal outflow in j2123 - 0050 @xcite is a prime example of all three , exhibiting variability , partial covering , and broad profiles that still have fwhms that are as narrow or narrower than many of the systems in j1023 + 5142 .",
    "there is more tentative evidence for a quasar outflow origin in the apparent line  lock between the c  iv  doublets in systems 1 and 2 .",
    "line  locking , where the difference in outflow velocities of two systems is exactly the velocity separation of the doublet , means that the lines are being radiatively accelerated directly towards the observer .",
    "the reality of the line  locking in this case is unclear , due to the difference in derived metallicities between the two systems .",
    "nevertheless , the incredibly small velocity offset (   [ subsec : id ] ) , along with the very small probability for chance alignments @xcite suggest that the phenomenon may be real . the possible line ",
    "lock in c  iv  in systems 1 and 2 suggests that they are both part of an outflow and that these weak c  iv  lines play a significant role in radiatively driving the flow .",
    "if this is really the case here , the gas probably originated near the source of radiative acceleration , i.e. the quasar .",
    "finally , we note a trend in line width with velocity shift away from the quasar .",
    "the narrowest lines , with fwhm  @xmath127  km  s@xmath1  are closest to the quasar redshift .",
    "the lines appear progressively broader as the velocity shift increases , with the broadest system described as a ( narrow ) mini - bal with fwhm  @xmath128  km  s@xmath1 , shown in figure  [ fig : civ ] .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been observed before in other quasars with multiple c  iv  absorption lines clearly forming in outflows @xcite .",
    "although it provides no direct information on the absorber locations , the appearance of this pattern in j1023 + 5142 supports the idea that at least some of the systems form in a quasar outflow .",
    "the tight grouping of all nine of the systems also suggests a relationship between them .",
    "determine that the probability of six similarly grouped nals in the quasar rx j1230.8 + 0115 all forming in intervening ( uncorrelated ) gas at similar velocity shifts is extremely small .",
    "the similarities between those nals and the nal complex in j1023 + 1542 implies a similarly small probability for all nine nals in this complex forming independently in intervening gas .",
    "although there could be up to several interlopers in the nal complex of j1023 + 5142 that might form in nearby galaxies in the line of sight , the density of these galaxies required to form all of the absorbers in the complex is beyond any expectations of cluster density at this redshift .",
    "overall , we conclude that at least six out of the nine systems originate in a highly structured outflow driven by the quasar , because they exhibit one or more of the following properties : partial covering , broad profile shapes , large line strengths , tight grouping with other systems , and proximity to the quasar redshift .",
    "systems 5 and 6 are the most likely outflow candidates because they exhibit partial covering as well as several of the other properties listed above .",
    "systems 4 and 8 are likely outflows because of their strong , broad , asymmetric and smooth profiles and systems 7 and 9 are probably outflows because of their broad and smooth shapes .",
    "systems 1 through 3 are more ambiguous in origin , with narrow widths , complete covering , lower velocity shifts and smaller strengths .",
    "however systems 1 and 2 exhibit line - locking , which could be evidence of an outflow .",
    "ultimately , we find strong evidence that systems 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 are part of a quasar outflow , whereas systems 1 , 2 , and 3 could consist of intervening gas from the igm or other galaxies in the line of sight .",
    "as described in ",
    "[ sec : loc ] , the evidence suggests that the majority of absorption lines in this grouping are part of a complex quasar outflow .",
    "this flow must be highly structured , with at least 6 and as many as 9 distinct absorbing structures along the line of sight .",
    "the velocities in the 6 most secure outflow systems range from -2120 to -4760  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "several of these systems ( 4 , 6 , 7 and 8) also have super  thermal line widths , indicative of large turbulence or strong radial velocity sheer across the outflow structure .",
    "some of the outflow structures , represented by systems 5 and 6 , must be spatially small to produce partial covering of the background emission source .",
    "these lines lie on top of the very weak c  iv  broad emission line .",
    "therefore , nearly all ( @xmath12980% ) of the flux beneath these lines is continuum emission and any partial covering below @xmath130 can be ascribed to the continuum source and not the much larger blr .",
    "we estimate the diameter of the accretion disk continuum source at 1550    to be @xmath131  pc and the diameter of the c  iv  broad line region to be @xmath132  pc , based on the scaling relationsl@xmath133(1450 ) , gives @xmath0l@xmath134(1450 ) .",
    "we measure the c  iv  emission line fhwm in the sdss spectrum , and using equation 7 in @xcite , derive a black hole mass of @xmath135 . based on these values",
    ", we calculate an eddington luminosity fraction of 0.8 .",
    "the black hole mass and eddington luminosity fraction are then used in the scaling relations in @xcite to calculate the size of the continuum and broad line emission regions . ] in @xcite . to partially cover the emission source",
    ", the absorbing clouds should have characteristic sizes similar to or less than the blr diameter , and possibly even less than the accretion disk diameter",
    ".    if the absorbers are discrete clouds , their small sizes and substantial velocity dispersions should lead to fairly rapid dissipation in the absence of an external pressure ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the characteristic size of @xmath136  pc or @xmath137  pc combined with @xmath138  km  s@xmath1  in the partial covering system 6 indicate a dissipation time of roughly @xmath139  yrs or @xmath140  yrs . at the measured velocity of v  @xmath141  km  s@xmath1 , this gas component would travel just @xmath142  pc or @xmath143  pc before dissipating .",
    "a thorough discussion of the creation and survival of these absorbing structures is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , these simple arguments suggest that at least some of the outflow components we measure are very near their point of creation .    it is useful to compare the basic properties of this nal outflow to bals .",
    "the ionisations in both types of outflows are similar , with very little low ionisation gas ( e.g. c  iii ) .",
    "the outflow velocities of the nals in j1023 + 5142 are lower , @xmath144  km  s@xmath1 , than the typical outflow velocities in bals , which can reach up to @xmath145  km  s@xmath1  @xcite , but they do overlap .",
    "the nals have total h column densities ( @xmath97 to @xmath4  @xmath5 , individual values listed in table  [ tab : abs ] ) , more than 1000 times lower than typical bal h column densities ( @xmath146  @xmath5 , and probably higher ) . by definition ,",
    "these nals also have fwhms around 1000 times narrower than typical bals , and much smaller rews as well .",
    "nonetheless , nals like this might be part of the same general outflow phenomenon as bals , viewed at different angles @xcite .",
    "this complex of weak nal outflows appears to be dramatically different from typical bal outflows , and constitutes a nearly unexplored part of the quasar outflow phenomenon , with a range of physical parameters and kinematics more complex and varied than previously thought .",
    "it is well - known that nals are a common feature of quasar spectra .",
    "previous surveys have found that 40% of quasars have c  iv  nals , in particular 25% have strong c  iv  nals within v  @xmath147  km  s@xmath1  @xcite , 60% have quasar - driven outflows in some form , either bals , nals , or something in - between @xcite , and including high - velocity outflows raises the percentage to 70% @xcite .",
    "if the coverage fraction of these outflows is less than 100% , which is likely , they could be ubiquitous in the near quasar environment , and could potentially play an influential role in the physical processes occurring therein .",
    "finally , we would like to understand what role the nal outflow in j1023 + 5142 might have in feedback to galaxy evolution .",
    "the low speeds and small column densities , e.g. , compared to bal flows , suggest that its feedback contribution is negligible . however , there are large uncertainties relating to the outflow location and geometry .",
    "for one particular nal outflow at a derived radial distance of @xmath148  pc , @xcite estimate that the kinetic energy yield is several orders of magnitude smaller than that necessary to influence feedback . at the opposite extreme ,",
    "@xcite argue that the feedback contribution is significant for another nal outflow at a derived distance of @xmath149  kpc . the location of the nal outflow in j1023 + 5142 is not known well enough to make these estimates .",
    "a more sensitive search for variability in these nals could be very helpful for refining both the location and the total energy yield ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we find greater than or consistent with solar abundances in all of the absorption systems in j1023 + 5142 except in system 1 , in agreement with previous studies of narrow associated absorption at lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "these high metallicities are consistent with the results of other studies of intrinsic gas as well , including bel gas @xcite and therefore consistent with our interpretation that the gas is intrinsic to the quasar .",
    "intervening absorbers generally have very low metallicities , with @xmath150 no more than a few hundredths solar , although there are cases where high metallicity intervening gas has been observed @xcite .",
    "we argue that the high metallicities found in 8 of the 9 systems in this quasar are consistent with locations near the quasar , however , we do not rely solely on this argument to determine the gas location .",
    "instead , we consider that high metallicities could be a general phenomenon found in all gas in the quasar host environment @xcite .",
    "the high metallicities of the nal systems in j1023 + 5142 require that its host galaxy had vigorous star formation in the epoch before the quasar was observable , leading to metal - rich gas in the quasar outflows @xcite .",
    "this evidence , along with previous studies of bels lead us to conclude that the generally accepted paradigm of quasar - host galaxy evolution is correct , where a major merger leads to a vigorous burst of star formation , which then funnels gas to the centre of the galaxy and ignites a quasar that eventually blows out obscuring gas and dust to become visibly luminous @xcite . however , larger samples are needed to examine the full range of nal properties and study their relationships to quasar outflows and host galaxy environments .",
    "measurements at high redshifts are particularly valuable because this is the main epoch of host / massive galaxy formation when the nal gas might have a close relationship to ongoing or recent star formation in the hosts .",
    "we use nals to improve our understanding of the evolutionary relationship between the central black hole and its host galaxy through the study of their location , origin and abundance information in high redshift quasars . here",
    ", we examine the properties of nine nal systems in the quasar j1023 + 5142 and find @xmath151 from @xmath152 to @xmath4 @xmath5 , velocities from 1400 to 6200  km  s@xmath1 , c  iv  doppler @xmath37 values from 7 to 150  km  s@xmath1 , c  iv  rew from 0.02 to 0.81    and two systems with partial covering of either the continuum or the blr , at the level of @xmath98 , which imply absorber diameters of @xmath99  pc or @xmath100  pc .",
    "the nal systems all appear to be highly ionised ; none of the systems exhibit low ionisation species such as si  ii , c  ii or si  iii , whereas all contain c  iv  and some contain higher ionisation species such as o  vi  and n  v.    the c  iv  absorption nals are tightly grouped , suggesting that they have a physical relationship to one - another , and the proximity of the nal complex to the quasar redshift suggests that the physical relationship includes the quasar itself .",
    "the range in velocity across the complex is larger than can be easily explained by a single galaxy or even by a large cluster of galaxies .",
    "a more likely explanation is that the nal complex formed in a multi - component quasar - driven outflow .",
    "we estimate directly the location of each system in j1023 + 5142 through the use of several diagnostics and find strong evidence ( partial covering , broad and smooth profiles compared to thermal widths , velocities greater than galaxy dispersion velocities , supersolar metallicities ) that systems 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 are part of a quasar outflow .",
    "systems 1 , 2 , and 3 have more ambiguous origins because they exhibit narrow widths , lower velocity shifts , and system 1 has a lower metallicity , so these systems could consist of intervening gas from the igm or other galaxies in the line of sight .    systems 29 in j1023 + 5142 exhibit supersolar metallicities ranging from @xmath101 to @xmath102 .",
    "system 1 has a lower metallicity of @xmath103 .",
    "the high metallicities are consistent with scenarios of galaxy and black hole formation and evolution .",
    "the nals in outflows appear to be part of a related outflow complex , which is very different than other known outflow regions such as bal outflows , and constitutes a relatively unexplored part of the quasar outflow phenomenon .",
    "the outflows in j1023 + 5142 could be important for feedback between the black hole and the host galaxy , depending on the radial distance of the gas from the quasar .",
    "the narrow widths of nals mean that detailed studies of individual objects like this are the only way to make progress in understanding this type of outflow .",
