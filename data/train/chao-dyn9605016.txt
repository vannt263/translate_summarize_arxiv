    "since the works of bnard @xcite at the beginning of this century , thermal convection became one of the most studied pattern forming systems @xcite . in bnard - marangoni ( bm ) experiments a fluid layer confined in a container open to the atmosphere is heated from below . when the difference of temperature between the top and the bottom surface ( i.e. @xmath0 ) is bigger than a critical value convection appears .",
    "pearson @xcite showed that besides buoyancy forces , thermocapillarity effects provide another instability mechanism in this case .    for shallow layers buoyancy forces",
    "dominate , while for thick layers thermocapillarity is the main mechanism .",
    "two different regimes appear depending on the liquid depth and the aspect ratio @xmath1 , i.e. , the ratio between the horizontal and the vertical dimensions of the vessel . for big aspect ratios ( @xmath2 ) regular patterns appear at the onset of convection ( typically hexagons in bm convection ) . for small @xmath1 ( @xmath3 )",
    "the arising patterns are determined by the geometry of the vessel . in a theoretical work rosenblat _",
    "_ studied the linear and weakly nonlinear problem with small aspect ratio for cylindrical @xcite and square @xcite containers . in the linear case buoyancy and thermocapillary forces",
    "were considered .",
    "but the extension to the nonlinear regime was only made for pure thermocapillary effects .",
    "there are important experimental contributions in these two regimes . for big aspect ratio",
    "the most interesting are due to koschmieder @xcite , cerisier @xcite and schatz _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . for small aspect ratio koschmieder and prahl",
    "@xcite performed experiments in square and cylindrical containers near convective threshold .",
    "described a series of dynamical patterns that look very different in square @xcite and in cylindrical containers @xcite .",
    "we study bm convection in a cylindrical container of small aspect ratio in the usual case when both , buoyancy and thermocapillarity forces , act together . in order to study the convective regime time dependent amplitudes of the unstable modes",
    "are considered .",
    "bifurcation theory shows @xcite that in a system with @xmath4 symmetry but with the reflection symmetry with respect to the middplane broken ( like in bm convection or in rayleigh - bnard convection under non - boussinesq conditions ) not only the modulus , but also the relative phases of the amplitudes must be taken into account .",
    "_ codimension two _ ( ct ) points , where two modes become simultaneously unstable are specially interesting because they can lead to a resonant interaction with a characteristic dynamical behaviour .",
    "a similar case has been studied in convection in spherical cells ( so(3 ) symmetry ) by friedrich and haken @xcite .",
    "in section 2 we present the basic equations and the boundary conditions governing the dynamics of the system . in section 3",
    "we perform a linear analysis and compare our results with the experimental ones .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the weakly nonlinear regime .",
    "in particular , we derive the amplitude equations for a 1:2 resonance , which were also derived for a model equation by means of bifurcation theory @xcite and studied in detail in ref .",
    "a physical interpretation of these results is made .",
    "finally , we discuss the main conclusions in section 5 .",
    "consider a fluid layer of depth @xmath5 confined between a conducting plate heated from below and an upper surface open to the atmosphere , under a temperature difference @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the fluid is newtonian and that boussinesq approximation holds .",
    "( we will follow the standard notation for the parameters of the fluid ) .",
    "then , in nondimensional variables ( obtained dividing space , time , velocity and temperature by @xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath0 respectively ) the equations governing the dynamics of the fluid are :    @xmath9    @xmath10=-\\nabla p +   r t{\\bf e_z } + \\nabla^2 { \\bf v}.\\label{ns}\\ ] ]    @xmath11    where the prandtl number @xmath12 gives an estimation of the relative importance of thermal and mechanical dissipative processes . in this work",
    "we take the limit @xmath13 , equivalent to assume that velocity perturbations relax much faster than temperature perturbations .",
    "this limit allows to neglect both , the advective term and the temporal derivative of the velocity in the navier - stokes equation , so the velocity field follows _ adiabatically _ the variations of temperature . the rayleigh number ( @xmath14 ) and the marangoni number ( @xmath15 ) measure the relative importance of buoyancy and thermocapillarity forces .",
    "they are not independent but related by a constant @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the limit @xmath18 corresponds to rayleigh - bnard convection while @xmath19 is reached when gravity forces are absent or the thickness of the fluid is very small ( @xmath20 ) . in this work",
    "we will analyse three situations : a ) @xmath21 , corresponding to the experiments in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , b ) @xmath22 , for some situations analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite and c ) @xmath23 , when surface tension is much greater that buoyancy effects , like in microgravity .",
    "in order to determine completely the problem we must give also some boundary conditions ( bc ) . the bottom is assumed to be rigid and conducting @xmath24{at}\\;z=0,\\ ] ] while for the upper surface , assumed to be nondeformable ( which is a good approximation for layers which are thick enough ) and partially conducting we consider heat transfer and the so called marangoni condition : @xmath25{at}\\;z=1,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is a reference temperature , @xmath27 are the components of the velocity in cylindrical coordinates @xmath28 and @xmath29 stands for the biot number , a phenomenological parameter that accounts for the heat transfer between the fluid and the air .",
    "the limit @xmath30 corresponds to a perfect conducting medium above the fluid while @xmath31 corresponds to an insulator material .",
    "we use for the rest of this paper the value @xmath32 typical in experimental situations @xcite .    in a finite container",
    "we must consider the horizontal extend by means of another nondimensional parameter , the aspect ratio @xmath1 , defined as the ratio between the radius and the height of the cylindrical container ( @xmath33 ) . to complete the problem",
    "we need some bc s on the sidewall that depend on the geometry of the vessel .",
    "for example , adiabatic walls are described by the condition : @xmath34{at}\\;r = a.\\ ] ] in usual experiments @xcite plastic sidewalls , matching that bc are used . for the velocity , instead of the usual non - slip condition",
    "we take non - deformable walls on which the tangential vorticity vanishes ( slippery walls ) @xmath35{at}\\;r = a,\\ ] ] this bc is used because the problem become separable , so analytical methods can be used .",
    "slippery `` walls '' are obtained in the separation among convective cells in a big aspect ratio system .",
    "although this b.c . does not correspond to that used in experiments , the corresponding solutions are expected to reproduce qualitatively the experimental facts .",
    "once the equations governing the dynamics are given we can seek for solutions of these equations .",
    "in particular , we are interested in those solutions that appear when the trivial one ( the conductive state ) becomes unstable .",
    "in this section we briefly recall the main results of the linear analysis of the equations and b.c .",
    "the conductive state has velocity and temperature fields in the form : @xmath36    and conserving only the linear terms we obtain : @xmath37 with bc : @xmath38{at}\\;&z=0.\\label{bcz0}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}+m\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x}= \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z}+m\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y}= w=\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial z}+bi\\theta=0&\\;\\makebox[1cm]{at}&\\;z=1.\\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial r}=u=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(rv)= \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r}=0&\\;\\makebox[1cm]{at}\\;&r = a.\\label{bcra}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    solutions of these equations can be written as : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the growth rate .",
    "when marginal stability ( @xmath43 ) holds , we have : @xmath44    separation of variables allows to consider solutions of the system ( [ cont.2])-([h.cond.2 ] ) with bc ( [ bcz0])-([bcra ] ) given by : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the azimuthal wavenumber , @xmath47 is the bessel function of order @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the radial wavenumber , which indexes the values @xmath50 satisfying the condition @xmath51 . due to symmetry",
    "there is no bc for the azimuthal equation , so the phase is not fixed and must be taken into account .",
    "this differs from the analysis of rosenblat _ et al _ @xcite , in which the phase dynamics was not considered .",
    "the functions @xmath52 , @xmath53 are solutions of the system @xmath54 with bc @xmath55{at}\\ ; z=0.\\\\ & & w = d\\theta+bi\\theta = d^2w+mk^2\\theta=0 \\;\\makebox[1cm]{at}\\ ; z=1 , \\label{bczz1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 .",
    "these equations have solutions for several values of @xmath57 denoted by @xmath58 , so the rayleigh number can be considered as the eigenvalue of the former system ( and @xmath59 may be considered as a vertical wavenumber ) .",
    "the critical rayleigh number ( @xmath60 ) is the minimum eigenvalue for which equations ( [ ecz])-([bczz1 ] ) have a solution .",
    "it corresponds to the onset of convection .",
    "nevertheless we must notice that in a real system we do not fix @xmath61 but @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the critical value @xmath60 we eliminate @xmath61 using the relation @xmath17 .",
    "then , the critical rayleigh number is : @xmath63    once @xmath60 determined the rest of the eigenvalues @xmath64 and the eigenfuntions @xmath65 , @xmath66 are calculated keeping the marangoni number fixed @xmath67 . in fig .",
    "1 we plot @xmath60 versus @xmath1 for the different modes for @xmath68 .",
    "for @xmath69 we recover the results quoted in ref .",
    "experiments are in qualitative agreement with these results , but a quantitative comparison is not possible mainly due to the idealized bc considered in our analysis .",
    "it was noticed that modes with @xmath70 appear for @xmath71 in experiments , a factor 2 bigger than our calculations @xcite .",
    "another discrepancy is that the mode @xmath72 is observed in convective cells with @xmath73 @xcite a fact that can not be explained theoretically .",
    "however , numerical simulations of the rayleigh - benard problem with realistic lateral bc show the same sequence as in the present paper @xcite .",
    "we perform a galerkin - eckhaus expansion of the fields in terms of eigenfunctions of the linear problem with time - depending amplitudes . after inserting this expansion in the pde s and projecting over the modes of the adjoint problem , an infinite - dimensional system of ode s for those amplitudes",
    "is obtained .",
    "then , a _ center manifold reduction _ is performed into the few modes that remain dynamically active after all transients have relaxed .",
    "projecting the nonlinear system on the eigenfunctions of the adjoint system one arrives to ( see appendix ) @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the adjoint modes and @xmath77 denotes the average over the fluid volume : @xmath78 the velocity and temperature fields are expanded in terms of the modes of the linear problem : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a complex amplitude with an indetermined phase @xmath81 included .",
    "we restrict our calculations to the neigbourhood of a codimension two ( ct ) point where two modes arise simultaneously . in our case",
    "the spatially homogeneous amplitude equations for these two modes match the _ normal form _ of such a ct point with @xmath4 symmetry @xcite : @xmath82 where @xmath83 are functions of @xmath84 and @xmath85 satisfying @xmath86 .",

    "we consider the critical modes ( 11 ) , ( 21 ) and a finite set of stable modes with lower growth rate , i.e. , ( ( 01 ) , ( 31 ) , ( 41 ) , ( 12 ) ) , which are then eliminated using the center manifold reduction ( see appendix for details ) .",

    "therefore , the amplitude of the mode ( 21 ) reverses sign . when @xmath150 there is a pure mode ( 21 ) that varies its phase in @xmath151 .",
    "experimentally this heteroclinic orbit would lead to patterns evolving from one pure mode to another with a phase changed in @xmath151 .",
    "this orbit is structurally stable to changes in the parameters @xmath152 .",

    "( [ ec.amp.1])-([ec.amp.2 ] ) ( imperfect symmetry ) destroy the heteroclinic orbit that degenerates into a limit cycle .",
    "in fact numerical noise suffices to convert the heteroclinic orbit into a periodic orbit in numerical simulations of eqs.([ec.amp.1])-([ec.amp.2 ] ) shown in fig .",
    "small thermal noise , cell imperfections , etc , unavoidable in real experiments will prevent the formation of the heteroclinic orbit which is replaced by periodic motions between modes ( 11 ) and ( 21 ) .    in fig .",

    "the quotations in these figures correspond to the stability regions of the different solutions . from figs . 7 and 8",
    "it can be deduced that for @xmath153 the dynamics begins with a mixed mode @xmath154 that changes into a rotating wave @xmath155 when the heating is increased . for @xmath156",
    "convection starts in a pure mode @xmath157 that bifurcates to a mixed mode @xmath158 .",
    "this is replaced by a heteroclinic orbit @xmath159 when the control parameter is rised .",
    "notice that @xmath159 is stable in a full region of parameter space .",
    "therefore we hope that a periodic dynamics that arises from this heteroclinic connection would be reachable in experiments with suitable conditions .",
    "we performed an analysis of bm convection in a cylindrical container with small aspect ratio . for the linear problem we calculated the marginal curve @xmath160 and the unstable modes as a function of the aspect ratio @xmath1 for several values of the ratio between surface tension and buoyancy effects ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "these results have been obtained for idealized lateral boundary conditions ( slippery walls ) .",
    "therefore , they allow only for qualitative comparison with experiments .",
    "the sequence of modes and the critical rayleigh number compares quite well with experimental findings .",
    "however , the critical aspect ratios calculated are smaller than those observed in experiments .",
    "this has also been obtained in the case of bm convection in a square container @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation is that the viscous boundary layer in real non - slippery walls rises the aspect ratio respect to an idealized slippery one .",
    "the nonlinear analysis is performed near a codimension two ( ct ) point where two stationary pure modes are simultaneously unstable .",
    "we choose a situation where a resonance 2:1 between modes ( 11 ) and ( 21 ) appears .",
    "a center manifold reduction is done to determine the coefficients of the normal form in the neighbourhood of that point .",
    "depending on the parameter values the stationary solutions are : a ) a pure mode ( p ) ( with two reflection symmetries ) , mixed modes ( m ) ( with only one @xmath113 symmetry ) , rotating waves ( rw ) ( without reflection symmetry ) and a heteroclinic orbit ( h ) .",
    "we calculate the dependence of rotation velocity of rw as a function of the order parameter .",
