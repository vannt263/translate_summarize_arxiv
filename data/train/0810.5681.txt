    "a _ differential structure _ of a manifold @xmath1 is a @xmath2 maximal atlas and , indeed , the charts of the atlas make up the _ primordial _ structure .",
    "the idea of a _ geometrical structure _ can be realized by the concept of @xmath0-structure when choosing the allowable meaningful classes of charts .",
    "general relativity is a physical theory , which is heavily based on differential geometry .",
    "the fundamental mathematical tools used by this theory to explain and to handle gravity are the geometrical structures .",
    "the space - time is described by a 4-dimensional manifold with a _ lorentzian metric field _ , and the theory put the matter on space - time , being mainly represented by curves in the manifold or by the overall stress - energy tensor .    the law of inertia in the space - time is translated into a _ projective structure _ on the manifold , which is provided by the geodesics of the metric in keeping with the equivalence principle .",
    "furthermore , the space - time in general relativity is a dynamical entity because the metric field is subject to the einstein field equations , which almost equate ricci curvature with stress - energy of matter .",
    "other main structures are the _ volume form _ , that is used to get action functionals by integration over the manifold , and the _ lorentzian conformal structure _ , that gives an account of light speed invariance .",
    "different approaches to gravity try to _ separate _ the geometry into independent compounds to promote the understanding about physical interpretation of geometric variables .",
    "the theory of @xmath0-structures of higher order is possibly the more natural framework for studying the interrelations involved among the relevant structures . in a pseudo - riemannian manifold there",
    "are defined unambiguously the following structures : _ volume form , conformal structure , pseudo - riemannian metric , symmetric linear connection and projective structure_. volume , conformal and metric structures are @xmath0-structures of first order , but each of them lead to a _ prolonged _ second order structure .",
    "symmetric linear connection and projective structure are _ inherently _ @xmath0-structures of second order .",
    "we will try to clarify this unified description .",
    "a differentiable manifold @xmath1 is a set of points with the property that we can cover it with the charts of a @xmath2 @xmath4-dimensional maximal atlas @xmath5 .",

    "an @xmath3-frame is an @xmath3-jet at @xmath7 of inverses of charts of @xmath1 ; two charts are in the same @xmath3-jet if they have the same partial derivatives up to @xmath3-th order at the same origin of coordinates . every @xmath6",

    "other representations of @xmath16 on subspaces of the tensorial algebra over @xmath9 give associated bundles whose sections are the well - known tensor fields .",
    "the _ bundle of 2-frames _ @xmath17 is somehow more complicated .",
    "every 2-frame is characterized by a _ torsion - free transversal @xmath4-subspace _ @xmath18 .",
    "it happens that the chart s first partial derivatives fix @xmath19 and the second partial derivatives give the inclination of that @xmath4-subspace .",
    "the group @xmath20 is isomorphic to @xmath21 , a semidirect product , with @xmath22 the additive group of symmetric bilinear maps of @xmath23 into @xmath9 ; the multiplication rule is @xmath24 , for @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",

    "we define a _ pseudo - riemannian metric _ as an @xmath45-structure , with @xmath46 . as in th.[thvol ] , we obtain bijections between the metrics and the sections of the associated bundle with typical fiber @xmath47 , and also with the equivariant functions of @xmath15 in @xmath47 .",
    "the first prolongation of @xmath48 is @xmath49 ; a consequence of this fact is the uniqueness of the _ levi - civita connection_.    a ( pseudo - riemannian ) _ conformal structure _ is a @xmath50-structure , with @xmath51 ( direct product ) ; this definition is equivalent to consider a class of metrics related by a positive factor , and in the lorentzian case , @xmath52 , a conformal structure is characterized by the _ field of null cones_. the first prolongation of @xmath53 is @xmath54 .",
    "the named second prolongation @xmath55 is equal to 0 ( i. e. , @xmath53 is of finite type 2 ) ; this deals with the existence and uniqueness of the normal cartan connection but we do not deal with this here ( see @xcite ) .",

    "a _ symmetric linear connection _ ( slc ) on @xmath1 is a distribution on @xmath15 of torsion - free transversal @xmath4-subspaces , which is invariant by the action of @xmath16 .",
    "identifying @xmath61 , we can define an slc on @xmath1 as a second order @xmath16-structure . from bundle theory , as in th.[thvol ] , every slc @xmath62 is a section of the associated bundle to @xmath17 and the action of @xmath63 on @xmath64 , and corresponds to an equivariant function @xmath65 , verifying @xmath66 , for @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath70 be a first order @xmath0-structure on @xmath1 ; a _ symmetric connection on @xmath70 _ is a distribution on @xmath70 of torsion - free transversal @xmath4-subspaces , which is invariant by the action of @xmath0 , thereby producing a second order @xmath0-structure , whose @xmath71-extension is an slc on @xmath1 .",
    "reciprocally , a second order @xmath0-structure determines a first order @xmath0-structure and a symmetric connection on it .",

    "a @xmath0-structure @xmath70 can admit many torsion - free transversal @xmath4-subspaces in @xmath79 , for every @xmath80 .",
    "we have the following result ( see @xcite ) :    if a first order @xmath0-structure @xmath70 admits a symmetric connection , the set @xmath81 of 2-frames corresponding with torsion - free transversal @xmath4-subspaces included in @xmath82 is a second order @xmath30-structure .",

    "a _ ( differential ) projective structure _ is a set of slcs which have the same geodesics up to reparametrizations ; we can define it as a second order _ @xmath83-structure _ with @xmath84 .",
    "considering geometrical structures on second order , with the same techniques than in the th.[thmetric ] for the first order ( see ref .  ) , we obtain :    a projective structure and a volume on @xmath1 give an slc belonging to the former and making the volume parallel .",
    "hence , a volume select a class of affine parametrizations for the paths of a projective structure .",
    "contrarily , a projective structure and the prolongation of a conformal structure not always intersect ; if they intersect we get a weyl structure .",
    "the study of integrability conditions of higher order , like curvatures , with respect to the interrelations of these @xmath0-structures is probably the natural next step following this work .",
