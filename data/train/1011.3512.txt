    "two extremely luminous core - collapse ( cc ) supernovae ( sne ) were recently discovered with faint or non - detected hosts , one at low redshift ( sn2005ap , @xmath7 at @xmath8 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and one with _ hst _ at a higher redshift ( scp 06f6 , @xmath9 at @xmath10 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent wide - area surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have discovered similar objects revealing a new class of extremely luminous cc sn @xcite that were missed in earlier host - targeted surveys due to their preference for faint hosts @xcite .",
    "it is not uncommon that other types of extremely luminous sne are found in low - luminosity hosts ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for example many extreme sne iin ( see  [ sec_data ] ) seem to prefer dwarf hosts @xcite , but not always @xcite .",
    "the preference these extremely luminous sne ( lsne ) have for low - mass and presumably low - metallicity hosts implies a factor in their production specific to the host galaxy .",
    "it is thus important to begin to quantify the local host environments of the lsne .",
    "the link between galaxy mass and metallicity demonstrated in @xcite and the lsn preference for low - mass hosts could imply that metallicity has an influence on the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "this preference for low - mass hosts could also be a natural consequence of an increase in the efficiency of metal - line driven stellar winds that lower the final masses of these same objects in larger galaxies and consequently produce lower - luminosity explosions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the extreme masses of the lsne progenitors in low - mass galaxies offers the opportunity to test models of the imf that posit distributions limiting the most massive star based on available star - forming gas @xcite .",
    "three scenarios have been explored that can produce lsne : the large production of radioactive fuel produced from the thermonuclear burning of a massive oxygen core that is instigated by a pulsational electron - positron pair instability ( pisne * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the interaction of the outburst with a dense circumstellar envelope either left over from progenitor formation @xcite or produced by late time mass - loss @xcite , and the energy from a rapidly - rotating magentar formed in the collapse of the lsn progenitor star @xcite . the first two scenarios naturally imply extreme masses for the progenitors of lsne , in some cases in excess of 150  @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "theoretical treatments of the magnetar scenario predict the basic form of observed lsn light curves @xcite , but have yet to provide predictions of detailed spectral features , unlike the pair - production theory which matches the light curves @xcite and predicts the production of fe - group elements that have been observed @xcite . without these predictions it is yet unclear how many , if any , of the lsne are magnetar - powered . the same wind - driven mass loss ( wdml ) and",
    "hence correlation with host metallicity and mass could operate in this scenario , if it turns out that magnetar progenitors are also highly massive .",
    "the mass of magnetar progenitors is currently being debated in the literature @xcite and range from @xmath12 to @xmath13 . until we can confirm that magnetars have actually powered a lsn , it is safer to make the assumption that the lsne arise from very massive progenitors .    from a galaxy evolution standpoint ,",
    "the formation of massive stars in low - mass dwarf galaxies implies the very high - density star formation typically found in uv - luminous galaxies ( uvlgs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and local lyman - break analogs ( lbas , * ? ? ?",
    "the lsn hosts may delimit the low - luminosity , low - mass , low - metallicity range of these extreme compact starbursting objects , that have not yet made it into current uvlg and lba samples .",
    "it is thus important to compare the properties of the lsn hosts with those of the uvlgs and lbas .",
    "we begin the examination of lsne local environments by comparing the hosts of seventeen of the most luminous sne on record with a sample of @xmath1 galaxies from a cross - match @xcite between the sdss spectroscopy catalog and the galaxy evolution explorer ( _ galex _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ir1.1 catalogs .",
    "we use uv and optical photometry of the hosts to fit star formation history ( sfh ) models and estimate their luminosity - weighted age ( @xmath14 ) , stellar mass ( @xmath4 ) , and current star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "we compare the distributions of the lsn hosts with the larger sample on the galaxy @xmath2 versus @xmath3 color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) and a diagram plotting specific star formation rate ( @xmath15 ) versus @xmath4 to demonstrate their extreme nature and to explore other relationships between the lsn subtypes and their host properties .",
    "we also compare the sfr of the lsn hosts with models that relate sfr to the imf @xcite to estimate the probability of producing the high - mass stars capable of producing lsne .",
    "our initial sample of seventeen lsne consists of all those discovered to date with @xmath16 as derived from modern ( post 1990 ) photometry @xcite .",
    "our sample includes the lsne produced by the interaction of the explosion ejecta and the surrounding circum - stellar matter .",
    "this subgroup is characterized by narrow emission lines in their spectra and are called type  iin - lum .",
    "two of our sample ( sn1999as and sn2007bi ) have been determined to be pisne by their light - curves and by showing fe - group elements in their spectra @xcite and are labeled ic - pp .",
    "the other class of lsn studied here we label type ipec , which denotes the lack of h emission in their spectra and their peculiar properties ( spectra and lightcurve ) when compared with any other sn type @xcite .",
    "these are possibly pulsational pisne as well @xcite , but their spectra and light - curves do not allow a conclusive classification .    for a comparison sample",
    "we use the cross - match between the spectral sample of sdss dr4 and the _ galex _ g1 interim release ir1.1 catalog presented in @xcite .",
    "the basic sample criteria limit the apparent sdss r - band magnitude of this sample to 17.6 and limit the redshift to @xmath17 . the nuv completeness for blue galaxies on the faint end",
    "is @xmath18% for this sample , while the nuv faint limit does lead to higher incompleteness for faint red galaxies . for more details on the sample selection , see  2.2 of @xcite .",

    "therefore , we place the type symbol ( red ) and identification along the bottom edge of the diagram . for sn2005ap and sn2010gx , the optical detections allow us to measure @xmath3 , but the limits in @xmath25 only allow us to limit the @xmath2 color to be red - ward of ( above ) the symbol .",
    "we now examine the physical conditions within the host galaxies and plot the seventeen lsne hosts on a diagram of @xmath5 versus @xmath4 in figure  [ fig_ssfr ] .",
    "the contours for the larger sample in this case are derived in two - dimensional bins of 0.2 dex wide in @xmath4 and 0.1 dex wide in @xmath5 .",
    "the darkest contour represents a density of 282 galaxies per bin and the lightest contour 17 galaxies per bin , with individual galaxies plotted below this density .",
    "the symbol coding for the lsne hosts is the same as in figure  [ fig_cmd ] . for comparison",
    ", we plot the large magellanic cloud as the solid circle , using the mass range reported in @xcite and the current sfr from @xcite . since we are comparing individual galaxies to the larger sample , we do not apply a volume correction to the larger sample .",
    "this accounts for the difference between our figure  [ fig_ssfr ] and figure  26 from @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig_cmd ] and [ fig_ssfr ] together support the notion that there is an environmental factor in the production of lsne .",
    "their distribution in the figures tends toward extreme regions of low luminosity , blue @xmath2 , low mass , but high ssfr in spite of having low sfr .",
    "undoubtedly there is incompleteness in the larger sample , but it is hard to imagine a scenario where incompleteness dominates the distribution of the lsne , given that many fainter sne are found in more luminous galaxies @xcite , and that these more luminous galaxies were preferentially surveyed for decades before areal sn searches were feasible .",
    "the incompleteness in the larger sample limits our ability to say just how rare the lsn hosts are , but with upcoming deeper , wide - field , multi - band surveys , the incompleteness limits will be pushed fainter and allow us to measure their volumetric density . for now , the presence of a lsn within a low - luminosity host indicates that the host is undergoing an episode of active , high - density , high - mass star formation .",
    "the extreme luminosity of lsne , allowing them to be detected to high redshift , make lsne guides for our exploration of star formation in dwarf galaxies over a range of redshifts .",
    "looking at figure  [ fig_cmd ] in detail shows that our sample is not large enough to distinguish the lsne host @xmath3 distribution from the full cc host @xmath3 distribution shown in @xcite .",
    "if we divide the sample at the central minimum in the arcavi distribution ( @xmath42 ) and exclude sn2006gy ( see  [ sec_ssfr_vs_mstar ] ) and scp06f6 ( because of its high redshift and very uncertain k - correction ) , we count seven hosts brighter than this value and eight hosts fainter .",
    "three of the brighter hosts are upper limits and some or all could be counted in the fainter group .",
    "clearly nothing conclusive can be derived from this , but it begs for deeper photometry and larger samples to see if the lsne hosts are drawn from a different , lower luminosity parent population than the other cc sn hosts .",
    "we also do not see a definitive separation between iin - lum hosts and ipec or ic - pp hosts .",
    "the sne iin - lum must have had some level of mass loss in order to produce the narrow lines in their spectra from circum - stellar interaction .",
    "this could have resulted from wdml or from binary interaction or a combination of the two .",
    "if iin - lum hosts are systematically more massive and hence more metal rich @xcite than the type i lsne , this would imply that wdml is the dominant source of the circum - stellar matter and that the metals in the outer atmosphere have their source in the host galaxy itself .",
    "if , however , there is an intrinsic source of metals in the stellar evolution of the progenitor from atmospheric dredge - up or the material was ejected due to binary interaction , then the sne iin - lum could be found in hosts of any mass .",
    "four of the brightest type i sn hosts in figure  [ fig_cmd ] have only limits on @xmath3 and could move to fainter hosts leaving some of the iin - lums by themselves in brighter hosts .",
    "once again , only deeper photometry and a larger sample will bring this relationship into focus .      ) .",
    "the lmc is plotted for reference using values from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "[ fig_ssfr ] ]    figure  [ fig_ssfr ] illustrates the extreme nature of the lsne hosts .",
    "the error bars are large because in many cases our estimation of the host sfh is derived from detection limits .",
    "the grouping of the hosts near @xmath43 is caused by the combination of a finite time - step in the sfh models and the shortest lifetime of stars with seds that peak in the uv ( @xmath44 yr ) . with smaller time - steps and age indicators more sensitive to shorter timescales ( e.g. , h@xmath45 )",
    ", the most likely values for @xmath5 might be even higher .",
    "nearly every host is less massive and has a higher @xmath5 than the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the exception is sn2006gy ( see table  [ tab_host_sed ] ) , which appears in ngc1260 , a peculiar s0/sa galaxy . it has been pointed out that the site of sn2006gy is dusty @xcite and that the infra - red luminosity of the host implies a sfr that is not inconsistent with the production of high - mass stars @xcite .",
    "it is plausible that ngc1260 has recently accreted a star - forming dwarf that is similar to the other lsn hosts .",
    "given the low mass of the lsn hosts and their short ssfr timescales , it appears that lsne are produced in the infancy of a galaxy s evolution .",
    "the fact that sn2006gy is the only lsn host that appears in a high - mass host also implies that lsne are typically produced early in a galaxy s life , before encounters with larger galaxies .",
    "@xcite point out that sn2007bi presents a problem for pisn models that require either h - rich , moderate metallicity progenitors ( @xmath46 ) or population iii objects with @xmath47 @xcite , because the sn shows no evidence of being h - rich and yet the metallicity of the host is not consistent with producing a population iii progenitor ( @xmath48})_{host } = 8.15\\pm0.13 $ ] , * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible that the chemical evolution in such small dwarf galaxies is heterogeneous and sn2007bi could have formed from a pocket of primordial ( pop iii ) gas .",
    "@xcite call for better metallicity measurements of the host of sn2007bi , as their measurements were taken while the sn continuum was still present .",
    "it may also be important to acquire resolved metallicity measurements to sort out the spatial pattern of chemical enrichment in these young dwarf galaxies .",
    "if we compare the lsn hosts with the supercompact uvlgs from @xcite , we see that they share the same range of @xmath5 and have similar uv - optical colors .",
    "the most massive lsn hosts are consistent with the mass range for the supercompact uvlgs , but a large fraction of the lsn hosts are less massive .",
    "it is interesting to note that many of the lsn hosts have masses similar to individual star - forming clumps in a sample of lbas measured in @xcite .",
    "this implies that lsn hosts may delineate the low - mass tail of the lbas , or that they are building blocks from which lbas and uvlgs are constructed through mergers .",
    "finding stars as massive as any formed in the milky way in galaxies that are many orders of magnitude smaller has strong implications for our understanding of the upper end of the imf .",
    "it is exceedingly difficult to measure individual stellar masses in any but the nearest galaxies , so the lsne offer the opportunity to test and calibrate theories of the imf .    to illustrate the potential impact of lsne on our understanding of the imf",
    ", we examine a recent theory based on the notion that the imf in a given galaxy is the result of integrating all the imfs within individual clusters in the galaxy , each of which has an imf limited by the ongoing star formation @xcite . this integrated galaxy intial mass function ( igimf ) theory",
    "has successfully reproduced many observed properties of high - mass star formation @xcite .",
    "one standard igimf scenario predicts a relationship between the igimf and the ongoing sfr which is graphically presented in figure  4 of @xcite .",
    "this figure presents igimf curves for a range of sfrs ranging from @xmath49 to @xmath50 yr@xmath51 .",
    "if we compare the sfrs of the lsn hosts in table  [ tab_host_sed ] with these curves , we see potential discrepancies for some lsne depending on what the initial masses are .",
    "we have an estimate for the initial mass of the progenitor of sn2007bi of @xmath52 , and evidence that it was a single star , i.e. , very little circum - stellar material @xcite .",
    "our estimate of the sfr of the host of sn2007bi ranges from @xmath53 yr@xmath54 which is marginally consistent with the curves presented in figure  4 of @xcite if the initial mass of sn2007bi is @xmath55 and not greater .",
    "the most probable sfrs for many of the lsn hosts are lower than the host of sn2007bi .",
    "discrepancies with the standard scenario of the igimf theory could arise if any of the other lsne have progenitors with initial masses greater than sn2007bi .",
    "we must , however , remember that our sfrs for the lsn hosts are derived using methods that assume a single universal imf @xcite .",
    "for such small hosts , a single imf may be appropriate , but this requires spatially resolved imaging of the hosts to see if the majority of the star formation is occuring in a single , large cluster .",
    "a discrepancy may indicate simply that the igimf curves need to be extended to higher stellar masses .",
    "a problem would exist then only if the production of such a high mass star were exceptionally improbable .",
    "this could be tested by integrating the igimf to the mass of the lsn progenitor and comparing the calculated total mass of the host to the observed mass .",
    "another refinement of this comparison could be achieved by using sfrs based on indicators sensitive to even shorter timescales , i.e. , h@xmath45 which is sensitive over timescales of @xmath56 yr .",
    "the faintness of these hosts would require a significant investment in observing time to achieve this .",
    "on the other hand , any discrepancy could be evidence in favor of lower mass progenitors , perhaps consistent with the magnetar scenario .",
    "this consistency for sn2007bi , narrow though it is , is potentially another success for the igimf theory .",
    "we can see , however , that definitive tests await more accurate lsn progenitor mass estimates and a detailed characterization of the star formation in the host galaxies .",
    "the apparent preference that lsne have for extreme host galaxies argues for a local environmental effect in their production .",
    "the mass - metallicity relationship @xcite and the effect of metallicity on the efficiency of stellar winds argues that wdml is the physical mechanism that prevents lsne from being produced in more normal , higher metallicity hosts .",
    "the extreme nature of the lsn hosts is attested to by comparing their distribution in figures  [ fig_cmd ] and [ fig_ssfr ] with a much larger sample of nearby galaxies from the sdss - _ galex _ cross - match presented in @xcite .",
    "their distribution in @xmath3 may be different from the general cc host distribution presented in @xcite , but a measurement of this difference awaits deeper photometry and a larger sample of lsne hosts . measuring a difference between the hosts of type iin and type i lsn hosts also awaits better data .",
    "the low sfr of the lsn hosts and the possibly high initial mass estimates of the lsn progenitors places them in a crucial location of theoretical diagrams relating the imf or the igimf to ongoing sfr .",
    "potential discrepancies with current theories may exist , but only if typical host sfrs are less than @xmath57 yr@xmath51 and progenitor mass estimates significantly exceed @xmath58 .",
