    "unlike ordinary three - dimensional systems , quantum two - dimensional systems of indistinguishable particles allow for generalized braiding statistics . a celebrated generalization of the usual bosonic and fermionic quantum statistics is provided in two dimensions by abelian anyons , for which a phase factor multiplying the scalar wavefunction is associated to elementary braiding operations @xcite @xmath0 anyons , first studied in @xcite , were later associated to the physics of the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "abelian anyon statistics of the simplest qh states , at filling factors @xmath1 were derived from a microscopic theory @xcite : since then , the study of the properties of abelian anyons and the applications to the qhe have been in the following decades subject of an intense and continuing interest @xcite .    a further generalization of the bosonic and fermionic statistics is represented by non - abelian anyons , described by a multi - component wavefunction @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) which undergoes a linear unitary transformation under the effect of braiding @xmath4 which exchanges the particles at the positions @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7_{ab } \\ , \\psi_b \\,\\,\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 are @xmath9 dimensional unitary matrices which do not commute among themselves , @xmath10_{ab } [ \\rho(\\sigma_j)]_{bc } \\neq [ \\rho(\\sigma_j)]_{ab } [ \\rho(\\sigma_i)]_{bc}$ ] @xcite .",
    "abelian and non - abelian anyons respectively correspond to one - dimensional and higher - dimensional representations of the braid group : with respect to parastatistics , non - abelian anyons represent the counterpart of the generalization represented by abelian anyons with respect to ordinary bose and fermi statistics . non - abelian anyons naturally appear in the description of a variety of physical phenomena , ranging from the fractional qhe @xcite to the scattering of vortices in spontaneously broken gauge theories @xcite , the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity @xcite and the alternation and interchange of @xmath11 and @xmath12 period interference oscillations in qh heterostructures @xcite .",
    "the non - abelian anyons studied in this work are non - abelian chern - simons ( nacs ) spinless particles .",
    "the nacs particles , which are pointlike sources mutually interacting via a topological non - abelian aharonov - bohm effect @xcite , carry non - abelian charges and non - abelian magnetic fluxes , so that they acquire fractional spins and obey braid statistics as non - abelian anyons .",
    "more specifically , our models are described by the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonianadelmodello ] ) which involves the isovector operators @xmath13 in a representation of isospin @xmath14 , where @xmath15 refers to any of the @xmath16 particles of the system . with respect to the index",
    "@xmath17 which labels the particles , these operators commute one to the other . correspondingly , the quantum dimension of our anyonic systems is an integer number , contrary to what happens , for instance , in the fibonacci anyons used to implement topological quantum computation @xcite , whose quantum dimension is instead an irrational number .",
    "futhermore the nacs systems studied in this paper are gapless in the thermodynamic limit , contrary to the fibonacci anyons or alike which have a gap in the bulk .",
    "the study of equilibrium properties of two - dimensional anyonic systems is in general a nontrivial and highly interesting task : indeed , the anyonic statistics incorporate the effects of interaction in microscopic bosonic or fermionic systems ( statistical transmutation ) so that the determination of thermodynamical properties of non - interacting anyons is at least as much as difficult as the similar computation in ordinary interacting gas .",
    "this is a reason for which the investigation of equilibrium properties of a free gas of anyons called for an huge amount of efforts and work @xcite , the other reason of course being that the thermodynamics of a system of free anyons is the starting point - paradigmatic for the simplicity of the model - for the understanding of the thermodynamics of more complicated interacting anyon gas .    the two - dimensional gas of free abelian anyons whose wavefunction fulfills hard - core wavefunction boundary conditions has been studied by arovas , schrieffer , wilczek , and zee @xcite in its low - density regime by taking its virial expansion . in particular , they found the exact expression for the second virial coefficient , that turns out to be periodic and non - analytic as a function of the statistical parameter .",
    "results for higher virial coefficients of the free abelian gas are also available in literature : different approaches have been used , including the semiclassical approximation @xcite and monte carlo computations @xcite ( for more references see @xcite ) .",
    "useful results can be found by perturbative expansions in powers of the statistical parameter @xmath17 : exact expressions for the first three terms of the expansions in powers of @xmath17 are available for each of the first six virial coefficients @xcite .",
    "the second virial coefficient is the only one presenting - in each of the bose points - cusps in the statistical parameter @xmath17 @xcite , i.e. none of the higher virial coefficients have terms at order @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a recursive algorithm permits to compute the term in @xmath18 of all the cluster and virial coefficients @xcite .",
    "the results for the virial coefficients of the free gas of abelian anyons quoted in the previous paragraph are obtained considering a many - body anyonic wavefunction fulfilling hard - core boundary conditions , i.e. a wave function which vanishes in correspondence of coincident points in the configuration space of the set of anyons .",
    "the generalization obtained by removing such an hard - core constraint has been studied for abelian anyons @xcite and a family of anyon models can be associated to the different boundary conditions of the same hamiltonian .",
    "these models are obtained within the frame of the quantum - mechanical method of the self - adjoint extensions of the schrdinger anyonic hamiltonian . in the following",
    "we will refer to anyons without the constraint of hard - core conditions as _ `` soft - core '' _ or _",
    "`` colliding '' _ anyons .",
    "the mathematical arguments underlying the possibility of such a generalization were discussed in @xcite , and the second virial coefficient of soft - core abelian anyons was studied in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding self - adjoint extensions for the non - abelian anyonic theory have been thoroughly discussed @xcite .",
    "we stress that it is not easy , in general , to extract the parameters of emerging effective ( eventually free ) anyonic models from the microscopic hamiltonians , and then the introduction of soft - core conditions may provide useful parameters which have to be fixed via the comparison between the results of the anyonic models and the computations done in the underlying microscopic models .    for non - abelian anyons , a study of the thermodynamical properties in the lowest landau level of a strong magnetic field has been performed @xcite , showing that the virial coefficients are independent of the statistics .",
    "the theory of non - relativistic matter with non - abelian chern - simons gauge interaction in @xmath19 dimensions was studied adopting a mean field approximation in the current - algebra formulation already applied to the abelian anyons and finding a superfluid phase @xcite .    in comparison with the abelian case ,",
    "the thermodynamics of a system of free non - abelian anyons appears to be much harder to study and all the available results are for hard - core boundary conditions @xcite , with - at the best of our knowledge - no results ( even for the second virial coefficient ) for soft - core non - abelian anyons .",
    "the reason of this gap is at least twofold : from one side , for the difficulties , both analytical and numerical , in obtaining the finite temperature equation of state for non - abelian anyons ( see the discussion in @xcite ) ; from another side , because most of the efforts have been focused in the last decade on the study of two - dimensional systems which are gapped in the bulk and gapless on the edges , as for the states commonly studied for the fractional quantum hall effect , while , on the contrary , the two - dimensional free gas of anyons is gapless .",
    "however , there is by now a mounting interest in the study of three - dimensional topological insulators , systems gapped in the bulk , but having protected conducting gapless states on their edge or surface @xcite : exotic states can occur at the surface of a three - dimensional topological insulator due to an induced energy gap , and a superconducting energy gap leads to a state supporting majorana fermions , providing new possibilities for the realization of topological quantum computation .",
    "this surging of activity certainly calls for an investigation of the finite temperature properties of general gapless topological states on the two - dimensional surface of three - dimensional topological insulators and superconductors .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the study of the thermodynamics of an ideal gas of a general class of nacs particles in presence of general soft - core boundary conditions : explicit results are found for the second virial coefficient .",
    "results for hard - core non - abelian anyons , which is a limiting case of soft - core conditions , are presented too .",
    "the article is structured as follows : in section [ themodel ] we introduce the nacs model studied in the paper and , as an introduction to the subsequent discussion , in section [ abeliananyons ] we briefly recall the results for an ideal gas of hard - core abelian anyons and we present in detail the general soft - core version of the abelian anyonic model .",
    "the properties of the virial expansion are also reviewed and the monotonic behaviour of the second virial coefficient @xmath20 with respect to the statistical parameter is taken in exam as the hard - core parameter changes : we observe , in particular , that for a narrow range of the soft - core parameter @xmath20 can be non - monotonic . in section [ nonabeliananyons ] we define the nacs model and we explicitly present the set of soft - core parameters associated to the most general boundary conditions of the wave - functions . in section [ hardcorecase ] the coefficient @xmath20 is evaluated for a system of nacs particles with hard - core boundary conditions : we compare our results with previous determination of this quantity and we make some comments about limit cases . in section [ generalsoftcorecase ]",
    "we study @xmath20 for non - abelian anyons when soft - core wavefunction boundary conditions are allowed , with special attention to the case of isotropic boundary conditions . in section [ otherthermod ]",
    "we summarize the virial expansions for the ideal gas of nacs particles endowed with general boundary conditions of the wave functions .",
    "our conclusion are discussed in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "finally the appendices deal with some technical details of the main text and with the energy spectrum in the soft - core case .",
    "in this section we introduce the abelian and non - abelian models studied in the paper : in section [ abeliananyons ] we first briefly remind the well - known results for the thermodynamics of the ideal gas of hard - core abelian anyons .",
    "the general soft - core version of the abelian anyonic model is then introduced , and the behaviour of the second virial coefficient is studied as a function of the defined hard - core parameter . in section [ nonabeliananyons ]",
    "we define the nacs model , whose second virial coefficient will be derived and studied in the next section .",
    "the thermodynamics for a system of identical abelian anyons has been developed starting with the seminal paper @xcite , in which the exact quantum expression for the second virial coefficient is derived : @xmath21 eq .",

    "this quantity has been evaluated by different methods : one of them consists in an hard - disk - type regularization of the two - anyonic spectrum while another one is a based on path - integral approach yielding the two - body partition function , carried on by identifying the lagrangian of the system with the one relative to the bohm - aharonov effect @xcite .",

    "exact results for higher virial coefficients are not known , but a fair amount of information is available both for the third virial coefficient and for higher virial coefficients @xcite .",
    "the expression ( [ bdiarovas ] ) is the exact quantum result for the hard - core case , corresponding to impose the vanishing of the two - anyonic wavefunctions in the coincident points ( the limit configurations for which the coordinates of two anyons coincide ) .",
    "however , any arbitrary boundary condition for the wave - function is in principle admissible : in general it is the comparison with results from the microscopic interacting hamiltonian that should fix the relevant boundary conditions to be imposed .",
    "the second virial coefficient for abelian anyons in this general case has been studied in @xcite .    by relaxing the regularity requirements , allowing wave - functions to diverge for vanishing relative distance @xmath33 between the anyons according to the method of self - adjoint extensions , it is possible to obtain a one - parameter family of boundary conditions .",
    "the hard - core limit corresponds to scale - invariance in a field theoretical approach @xcite , where the scale can be precisely related to the hard - core parameter that will be defined below .",
    "the study of @xmath20 shows that the results for hard - core case are rather peculiar : for instance , the cusps at the bosonic points of the hard - core case are a special feature of the scale - invariant limit , which is however absent for all the soft - core cases . on the contrary ,",
