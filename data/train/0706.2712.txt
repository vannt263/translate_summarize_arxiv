    "ever since hubble s famous paper outlined his classification system @xcite , morphological classification in conjunction with physical measurement has become an important tool in extragalactic astrophysics .",
    "a number of quantitative classifiers have been developed or extended over the years to probe the structure of galaxies .",
    "there are parametric classifiers like radial multi - gaussian deconvolution @xcite , bulge - disk decomposition @xcite , etc . , and the nonparametric ones such as the c - a system @xcite , artificial neural nets trained from visual classification sets @xcite , gini coefficient @xcite and so on .",
    "as one of the main quantitative criteria and a function of the hubble classification , the bulge - disk decomposition has now been widely used as an effective method to examine galaxy structures and morphological properties , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc ) .",
    "the variations of galaxy physical properties with morphology and environment are crucial in our understanding of the evolution of galaxies @xcite",
    ". numbers of properties such as the integrated birthrate variation @xcite , the optical and infrared photometric properties @xcite , the star formation properties of galaxies in clusters @xcite , the circumnuclear h@xmath9 luminosity and bar structures @xcite , etc , which have been investigated present regularity or correlation along different morphological types . through substantial former investigations ,",
    "it is known that as a result of different stellar populations and the amount of dust and gas for the environment of star - forming , the early - type galaxies ( ellipticals and lenticulars ) exhibit rather different properties compared with the late - type ones ( spirals , irregulars and so on ) .",
    "as we know , averagely one third of the total luminosity from normal galaxies is absorbed and re - radiated by dust @xcite , and even higher fraction from galaxies with the most active star - forming activity ( e.g. luminous infrared galaxies ( ligs ) , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". both the infrared space observatory ( iso - * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and _ spitzer _ space telescope @xcite continued to explore the importance of dust .",
    "studies of dusty starburst galaxies @xcite have shown that , most of the activities ( e.g. , star - formation and/or agn emission ) in these galaxies are hidden by dust , and the bolometric luminosities of the active systems are mostly emitted in the infrared .",
    "this suggests that the infrared emission is a sensitive tracer of the young stellar population and star formation rates ( sfrs ) , and suffers weaker extinction .",
    "the mir dust emissions mainly consist of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) emission and the continuum emission feature of warm dust component .",
    "both of these two components have been investigated as reliable measures of the sfrs of galaxies as a whole @xcite .",
    "whereby studies in the mir properties will certainly improve our understanding of the galaxies which have been well studied in the optical bands , and give an insight into the details of their star formation histories .",
    "this work tries to explore the relationships between the morphology and the mir properties , for a flux - limited sample of normal galaxies which were selected from the galaxies of sdss - dr4 @xcite cross - correlated with the _ spitzer _ swire @xcite .",
    "considering that the _ spitzer _",
    "irac ( fazio et al . 2004 ) @xmath10 band covers the strongest pah feature ( @xmath11 ) , and the mips ( rieke et al . 2004 ) @xmath4 band covers the continuum emission of very small grains ( vsgs ) free of pah features , we tried to employ the irac bands and mips @xmath4 band to investigate the mir dust properties of entire galaxies .",
    "we performed elliptical aperture photometric analysis in both the optical and mir bands .",
    "the @xmath10 dust and @xmath4 dust luminosity and their dust - to - star ratios are used to quantitatively investigate the mir properties of our sample galaxies .",
    "two ways to classify the morphologies of the sample galaxies were adopted : the @xmath6 type of the revised hubble classification system @xcite by visual inspection , and the quantitative parameter of @xmath2 by the bulge - disk decomposition .    in  2 , we describe the infrared and optical data , the sample construction , and the elliptical aperture photometry .",
    "the morphological classifications are presented in  3 . in  4 , we analyze the optical and mir colors , and give the statistical results of the mir dust properties against galaxy morphological types and the corresponding discussions .",
    "the conclusions are presented in  5 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume a hubble constant @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 in calculating the distance and the luminosity .",
    "we used the irac @xmath15 and the mips @xmath4 images from the northern swire fields of lockman hole , elais - n1 , and elais - n2 .",
    "the bcd ( basic calibrated data ) images of the four irac bands were obtained from _ spitzer _ science center , which include flat - field corrections , dark subtraction , linearity and flux calibrations @xcite . the irac images ( in all four bands )",
    "were mosaiced from the bcd images after pointing refinement , distortion correction and cosmic - ray removal with the final pixel scale of @xmath16 as described by @xcite and @xcite ; likewise the mips @xmath4 images were mosaiced in the similar way with the final pixel scale of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "sources detected by sextractor @xcite in irac four bands and mips @xmath4 were matched with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) sources to achieve astrometric uncertainties of around @xmath18 .",
    "the sdss data provide full coverage of the swire fields of lockman and elais - n2 but cover only one third of elais - n1 field .",
    "the @xmath19 corrected frames of spectroscopically observed galaxies were taken from the sdss - dr4 .",
    "the pixel scale of sdss images is @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the sdss - dr4 @xmath19 spectrophotometric catalogue was cross - correlated with swire mir catalogue measured by sextractor @xcite by a radius of @xmath21 .",
    "the total survey area of the three northern swire fields is @xmath2224 deg@xmath23 , of which the overlap with sdss is @xmath2215 deg@xmath23 . to obtain the reliable morphological classification @xcite ,",
    "163 bright galaxies with petrosian magnitude @xmath24 were selected .",
    "only four sdss galaxies were not matched with swire mir sources by 2@xmath25 , since the sdss fiber observations mistakenly pointed to the off - nucleus regions rather than the nuclear regions of galaxies .",
    "this provides a preliminary sample of 159 galaxies .",
    "we excluded further five galaxies in our magnitude limited sample of 159 galaxies , because they failed in either the sky - background subtraction or the bulge - disk decomposition , or were severely contaminated by nearby bright stars .",
    "this led to a sdss @xmath1band flux - limited final sample of 154 galaxies .",
    "142 of this sample have been imaged by irac four bands and 137 have been imaged by mips 24@xmath26 m band .",
    "finally , a sub - sample of 125 galaxies has images in all five mir bands , and is used for further statistical discussion in  [ subsec : statistics ] .",
    "all of theses objects are local , with redshift less than 0.13 . in our sample ,",
    "six galaxies were with the absolute b magnitude fainter than -18 , and thus classified as dwarf galaxies @xcite . here",
    ", the b magnitude can be obtained from the sdss @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes @xcite .",
    "the distributions of sdss @xmath1band petrosian magnitudes , the redshift , and b - band absolute magnitudes for the 154 sample galaxies as well as those for the 125 sub - sample galaxies are plotted in figure  [ fig : properties ] .",
    "all these distributions show that the sub - sample can well represent the flux - limited sample .    among the 154 sample galaxies , 133 with emission line detections",
    "could be classified with the traditional @xmath27(/h@xmath28)-@xmath27(/h@xmath9 ) diagnostic diagram @xcite .",
    "the emission line fluxes were derived from the catalogue of @xcite .",
    "the criteria given by @xcite was adopted to distinguish the potential star - forming galaxies from agns , as is shown in figure  [ fig : bpt ] .      to obtain the accurate photometry , sky background fitting and subtraction were done @xcite on both the sdss corrected frames and the _ spitzer _ images .",
    "all objects detected by sextractor were masked to generate a background - only image , and the fitting sky - background was then subtracted .",
    "photometry was performed on the background - subtracted images by iraf task ellipse @xcite . to embrace almost all the flux of these extended sources in the different bands ,",
    "an elliptical isophote with the b - band surface brightness of 26 mag @xmath29 was adopted as the photometric aperture , based on the sdss @xmath0band images . with such elliptical apertures ,",
    "the total fluxes were measured in all the wavelengths including the sdss @xmath19 , the irac four bands and the mips @xmath4 band ( see sample apertures marked in figure  [ fig : sample ] ) with iraf task polyphot .",
    "note that the point source functions ( psfs ) of mips @xmath4 are rather extended , therefore further aperture corrections were performed on this band . for objects with the equivalent radius of the elliptical apertures smaller than @xmath30",
    ", aperture corrections were applied to calibrate the integrated flux to an equivalent radius of @xmath30 .",
    "the photometric accuracies of these different bands are quite small , less than 0.03 mag on average .",
    "flux calibration accuracies of the irac four bands @xcite and mips @xmath31 band @xcite are less than @xmath32 .",
    "the final errors include both the above errors .",
    "the galactic extinction in each sdss filter from sdss - dr4 catalogue was adopted , and then intrinsic extinction was derived from the balmer decrement @xcite .",
    "the photometric @xmath33-correction was calculated using the method of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kcorrect v4 - 1 - 4 ) .",
    "no extinction correction has been performed on photometric results in the mir bands since extinction effect is rather negligible in the infrared compared with optical wavelength . due to the fact that our sample are all low redshift galaxies and , as of this work , there are no reliable @xmath33-correction for these mir spectral ranges available yet , we applied no @xmath33-correction to the mir photometry .",
    "all the measurements were converted to ab magnitudes @xcite .",
    "although pah and vsg emissions dominate @xmath10 and @xmath4 bands for the majority of our sample , there is still a stellar continuum in these bands , especially for the early - type galaxies .",
    "herewith a subtraction of the stellar contribution using the @xmath5 luminosity was adopted , with a scale factor of 0.232 for the @xmath3 band and 0.032 for the @xmath4 band @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we denoted the 8@xmath34(dust ) and 24@xmath34(dust ) representing the dust emissions after subtracting the stellar contribution @xcite .",
    "we conducted the morphological classification by two methods : visual inspection and bulge - disk decomposition with gim2d ( galaxy image 2d : * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "gim2d is a two - dimensional photometric decomposition fitting algorithm which fits each image to a superposition of an bulge component with a srsic profile , and a disk component with an exponential profile @xcite .",
    "gim2d was employed to obtain the structural parameters of galaxies in our sample .",
    "the bulge component of the model is a profile of srsic form @xcite : @xmath35\\ } \\label{eqn : sersic.profile}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the surface brightness at a radius @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the characteristic value ( i.e. the effective surface brightness ) , defined as the brightness at the effective radius @xmath39 .",
    "parameter @xmath40 is related to the srsic index @xmath41 and chosen equal to @xmath42 so that @xmath39 remains the projected radius enclosing half of the light in this component @xcite .",
    "the disk component is an exponential profile of the form : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the central surface brightness , and @xmath45 is the disk scale length .",
    "decomposition was performed based on this model , with a gaussian psf .",
    "a total of twelve parameters were adjusted in fitting the galaxy image and retrieved as output from our decomposition : the total luminosity @xmath46 , the bulge fraction @xmath2 , the bulge effective radius @xmath39 , the bulge ellipticity @xmath47 , the bulge position angle @xmath48 , the disk scale length @xmath45 , the disk inclination angle @xmath49 , the disk position angle @xmath50 , the centroiding offsets @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the s@xmath53rsic index @xmath41 , and the residual sky background level @xmath54 . the @xmath2 which is defined as",
    "the fraction of the total flux in the bulge component has been extracted as a quantitative indicator of morphology .",
    "@xmath55 corresponds to a pure bulge , while @xmath56 to a pure disk .",
    "with all the objects detected by sextractor flagged except the galaxy of interest , the @xmath0band mask images were adopted not only in @xmath0band but also in @xmath1band , throughout the decomposition fitting with gim2d .",
    "figure  [ fig : sample ] shows example ( science , mask , model , and residual ) images of different morphological types in gim2d fitting .",
    "the returned @xmath57 values of @xmath0 and @xmath1band fitting have the mean values of 1.14 and 1.18 with deviations of 0.26 and 0.33 respectively , representing rather convincing fitting results .    to check the results",
    "obtained , we compared the parameters @xmath2 of the 154 galaxies estimated from @xmath0 and @xmath1band in figure  [ fig : gim2d ] .",
    "the @xmath2 values obtained from both bands agree well with small amount of deviation . among the three most deviated sources , sdss j161222.61 +",
    "525827.9 is an early - type galaxy with highly centralized surface brightness distribution in bluer band .",
    "sdss j151723.30 + 593517.0 is a peculiar galaxy and ugc5888 is an irregular .",
    "we adopted @xmath2 values derived from @xmath1band images throughout the following investigation since the decomposition results in the two sdss bands hold quite good agreement .",
    "the morphological types of revised hubble sequence @xcite of our sample galaxies were classified by visual inspection based on features like bulge ratios , the presence of spiral arms and/or bars , signs of interaction , multiple nuclei etc . all galaxies in our sample",
    "were classified into six morphological classes : @xmath58(e or s0 ) , 1(sa ) , 3(sb ) , 5(sc ) , 7(sd ) , and 9(irr ) .",
    "notice that we assigned an additional class 10 corresponding to galaxies with peculiar morphology possibly related to galactic interactions , mergers , etc .",
    "we performed the visual classification in both sdss @xmath0 and @xmath1band images .",
    "the classifications done independently by the four of us , agree in over 90% of the sample .",
    "the classifications were verified for 36 of those galaxies whose morphological types were found in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) and were found to be accurate to @xmath59 .    considering the possible effects that inclinations and bar structures may cause , we further divided sample galaxies into 3 types : barred galaxies , edge - on galaxies , and the rest defined as general galaxies for further consideration .",
    "note that when defining edge - on galaxies , we adopted a standard of gim2d fitted disk inclination angle @xmath60 .",
    "table  [ tab : mor.class ] shows the numbers and corresponding fractions of different morphological types in our sample . in table",
    "[ tab : mor.spitzer ] , we present the numbers of galaxies observed by different mir bands in each morphological type . it can be drawn from table 2 that the morphological fractions e / s0 : s(sa - sd ) : irr of optical-@xmath10 and optical-@xmath4 samples are 0.47 : 0.51 : 0.014 and 0.44 : 0.54 : 0.016 respectively .",
    "both are consistant with e(e / s0-s0 ) : s(s0a - sdm ) : i m of 0.40 : 0.57 : 0.014 obtained from an optically selected sample of sdss galaxies @xcite .      a comparison between hubble @xmath6 type and the bulge - to - total ratio @xmath2 has been carried out , as is shown in figure  [ fig : t.bratio ] . except for the peculiar galaxies which exhibit a diversity of @xmath2 , there is a smooth inclination in @xmath2 along hubble sequence from @xmath61 to @xmath58 , i.e. , for normal galaxies , except the peculiar , the late - types exhibit lower @xmath2 than the early - type ones .",
    "hence @xmath2 does act as a reliable measure of morphological types for normal galaxies in our sample . in order to statistically examine the properties of our sample",
    ", galaxies have been divided into two morphological types : the early - type ( e / s0 ) with t=0 , and the late - type ( sa , sb , sc , sd , and irr ) with t from 1 to 9 .",
    "consequently , according to @xcite , such a classification roughly corresponds to the division of @xmath62 .",
    "128 out of the 144 normal sample objects coincide with their morphological types classified with @xmath6 .",
    "the divisions are shown in figure  [ fig : t.bratio ] . since as a whole",
    ", divisions with the two methods agree with each other , we have adopted t type to divide the sample galaxies into either the early - type or the late - type in the following statistics .",
    "the optical - mir color - color diagrams are shown in the left panels of figure  [ fig : color ] , and there are anti - correlations between optical and mir colors , which is consistent with the result of @xcite .",
    "such a trend can be explained rather naturally : the optically blue color is related to the recent star formation , indicating the existence of notable amount of dust , and the mir dust emissions can be shown in both @xmath10 and @xmath4 bands . on the other hand ,",
    "optically red galaxies are always too old to contain plenty of dust , and hence present weak mir dust emissions .",
    "the right panels of figure  [ fig : color ] show the relationship between mir colors .",
    "it can be detected that [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colors in our sample are quite blue , with an average of around -0.52 , indicating that there is no extremely active galactic nuclei ( qso etc . ) in our sample , because both the emissions of @xmath5 and @xmath63 of normal galaxies are dominated by decreasing stellar continuum of the old stellar population .",
    "yet these two bands of very active galaxies like quasars are dominated by the power law spectra of quasars and consequently should exhibit redder [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colors .",
    "both colors of [ 3.6]-[8 ] and [ 3.6]-[24 ] can roughly characterize the relative strengths of the mir dust emissions of pahs and vsgs .",
    "the stronger the dust emissions , the redder the colors .",
    "therefore , it is not surprised to find that most of the peculiar galaxies of our sample at the redder part of these panels because they contain large amount of dust for their violent star formation @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of @xmath5 band is often treated as a tracer of stellar component ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc ) as well as a test of validity of mass determination @xcite .",
    "furthermore @xcite has compared the mass of clumps in arp 82 derived from _",
    "r _ band fluxes and broadband colors against luminosities of @xmath5 , and has found strong correlation between them .",
    "hereby the relationship between the stellar mass and the @xmath5 luminosity of our sample galaxies is examined .",
    "based on the optical photometries as described in   [ subsec : photometry ] , we calculated the stellar mass of our sample , following @xcite : @xmath64 \\label{eqn : mass.bell}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the @xmath1band absolute magnitude , @xmath66 is the rest - frame color in the ab magnitude system .",
    "the coefficients @xmath67 and @xmath68 come from table 7 of @xcite . a @xcite stellar mass initial function ( imf )",
    "has been adopted with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the distribution of the stellar mass for our sample galaxies is presented in figure  [ fig : properties ] , in a range between @xmath71 and @xmath72 , with the average mass around @xmath73 , as intermediate mass galaxies .",
    "a tight correlation of the stellar mass against the luminosity of @xmath5 is detected for our sample , as is shown in figure  [ fig : i1.mass ] .",
    "our result is consistent with that found by @xcite but with smaller scatters , thus it confirms the capability of the @xmath5 luminosity as a measure of the stellar mass of galaxies . based on our 145 galaxies and 24 clumps in arp 82 @xcite",
    ", we fit the relation between the stellar mass and the @xmath5 luminosity , and obtain a nearly linear correlation : @xmath74}{l_{\\odot } } ) \\label{eqn : i1.mass}\\ ] ]    as is pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , the mass - to - infrared light ratio is relatively insensitive to the star formation history , and remains very close to unity , independent of either galaxy colors or hubble types .",
    "this relation is probably due to the fact that in the near - infrared , older stellar populations may dominate both the galaxy luminosities and the stellar masses .",
    "therefore such a correlation provides a proxy way to estimate the stellar mass of galaxies directly from the integrated @xmath5 luminosity .",
    "figure  [ fig : mor.lum ] shows the @xmath10 and @xmath4 dust luminosities as the function of different morphological types in our sample . for normal galaxies , except the dwarfs , along either the hubble @xmath6 types or the @xmath2 ratios , there exist obvious declinations of the mir luminosities from the late - type to the early - type galaxies , especially showing a steep change around the division of the late - type and the early - type galaxies .",
    "all the peculiar galaxies show relatively higher mir luminosities , independent of their @xmath2 ratios .",
    "the phenomenon could be attributed to the fact that early - type galaxies are dominated by older population and are deficient of dust , resulting in lower mir dust luminosities , while the late - type contain larger amount of young stars and more dust thus present stronger mir emissions .",
    "peculiar galaxies which are undergoing strong star forming activities contain great amount of dust and thereby show averagely high mir luminosities .",
    "as @xcite has pointed out , both the @xmath10 and @xmath4 dust luminosities can be used as measures of sfrs of entire galaxies ; therefore , the correlations between the mir dust luminosities and morphological types reflect a consequent relationship between the galactic sfrs and morphological types .",
    "this also confirms the previous results of @xcite , @xcite , etc . as for the six dwarf galaxies , because they all have low mass of around @xmath75 ( from the previous mass determination ) , so they contain less dust and thus show lower mir dust emissions @xcite .",
    "the mir dust - to - star ratios are also plotted against different morphological types , in figure  [ fig : mor.ratio ] .",
    "the prominent correlations are also detected between the mir dust - to - star ratios and both the hubble @xmath6 types and the @xmath2 ratios .",
    "furthermore , such correlations seem to be more obvious than those between the mir luminosities and morphological types .",
    "since both the @xmath10 and @xmath4 dust luminosities possess correlations with sfrs for normal galaxies , and the @xmath5 luminosity is a reliable tracer of stellar component , such ratios can be treated as the dust - to - star ratios .",
    "the correlations between the mir dust - to - star ratios and the morphological types could represent the distribution of sfrs per unit stellar mass @xcite over different morphologies .",
    "contrary to the behavior in figure  [ fig : mor.lum ] , the dwarf galaxies are roughly consistent with the other late - type galaxies within the error bars , but still present a little lower dust - to - star ratios .",
    "this could be explained with the fact that the gravitation potentials of these low mass galaxies may not be strong enough to retain as much dust and gas against the radiation fields as those of the normal - mass galaxies , and hereby all the dwarf galaxies show slightly lower mir dust - to - star ratios .",
    "almost all the peculiar galaxies present higher mir dust - to - star ratios .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath10 dust luminosity to the @xmath4 dust luminosity is compared with different morphological types in figure  [ fig : mor.dust ] . considering the @xmath10 dust emissions mainly represent emission of pahs heated by b type stars while @xmath4 dust emissions stand for emissions from hot dust mostly heated by o type stars @xcite ,",
    "the ratio can be treated as the estimation of ratio between these two components . in general ,",
    "@xmath10(dust)-to-@xmath4(dust ) ratios remain constant on average along the hubble sequence , while the larger scatter in distribution of the early - type probably arises from existence of nuclear agns which destroy pah emissions presumably due to photodestruction of the pah molecules by euv / x - ray photons @xcite or the outer diffuse pah emissions heated by the older stars @xcite .",
    "this can also be seen in later discussion in figure  [ fig : sf.agn ] where agns present lower @xmath10(dust ) luminosities .",
    "it should be noted that the two dwarf irregular galaxies exhibit lower @xmath3(dust)-to-@xmath4(dust ) ratios than the most of the late - type do , possibly due to their low metallicities and @xmath76 respectively , about @xmath77 and @xmath78 the solar value @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite .",
    "the above result indicates that for the normal galaxies except the dwarfs , the ratio of these two dust components does not vary much against morphology .",
    "therefore the @xmath10(dust ) luminosities are as capable to trace the galaxy sfrs as the @xmath4(dust ) luminosities as @xcite has pointed out .",
    "in order to compare the statistical mir properties of different types of sample galaxies , we performed all the following statistics on the sub - sample of 125 galaxies which have photometric information for all the optical and mir bands . since from figure",
    "[ fig : properties ] and k - s test results this sub - sample does not exhibit notable differences from the 154-galaxy sample , we suggest that the following statistical discussions are representative of all the sample galaxies .",
    "distributions of the mir luminosities and dust - to - star ratios for both the early - type and the late - type galaxies in the sub - sample are presented in figure  [ fig : early.late ] .",
    "it is clear that , in general , the late - type galaxies exhibit quite different mir properties to early - type ones , presenting a distinct and statistically higher mir luminosities and dust - to - star ratios .",
    "the gaussian fitting is performed on each distribution , and the lines crossing intersection points of the two gaussian distributions are presented as the division of the two morphological types .",
    "in part a of table  [ tab : type ] , the median values and the mean values together with scatters of distributions of the early - type and the late - type galaxies are listed .",
    "probabilities that the distributions of these two types can match are all smaller than @xmath79 , indicating that they present quite distinct properties . therefore",
    ", both the mir luminosities and dust - to - star ratios can be used to separate the early - type galaxies from the late - type ones .",
    "table  [ tab : type.division ] displays specific values of divisions and the reliability of such classifications .",
    "we define the reliability of classification as the fraction of galaxies from the subsample that are selected by hubble @xmath6 types .",
    "for example , out of the 117 normal galaxies which have images in all irac bands , the t type criterion selects 64 late - type galaxies and 53 early - types .",
    "47 of the 64 late - type galaxies have @xmath80 and thus are consistently classified as late - type , while 47 of the 53 early - types have @xmath81 and thus are classified as early - type .",
    "therefore the @xmath82 maintains reliability of 73% for selecting late - type galaxies and 89% for early - types .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath83 gives a reliability of 70% for the late - type and 77% for the early - type ; @xmath84 can give a 88% for the late - type and 83% for the early - type ; and @xmath85 can give a 84% for the late - type and 85% for the early - type ; hereby the mir dust luminosities especially the mir dust - to - star ratios can be effective tools to divide the early - type galaxies from the late - type ones .",
    "the comparisons between mir properties of star - forming galaxies and agns ( see  [ subsec : sample ] ) are shown in figure  [ fig : sf.agn ] . generally , star - forming galaxies present stronger mir emissions than those possess agn activities . from part",
    "b of table  [ tab : type ] , the star - forming galaxies and agns show the probability of matching each other in @xmath10 and @xmath4 dust luminosites and dust - to - star ratios with less than @xmath86 , indicating quite different mir properties , although not so distinct as these between the early - type and late - type ones .",
    "some of the sample galaxies are edge - on galaxies and some are barred galaxies . will the galaxies in edge - on view or with bars present different mir properties ?",
    "we compare the distributions of the mir dust luminosities and the mir dust - to - star ratios between edge - on galaxies , barred galaxies and normal galaxies in figure  [ fig : edge.on ] and figure  [ fig : bar ] .",
    "the statistical results are listed in part c and d of table  [ tab : type ] , with the probabilities in matching each by few to tenth percent , indicating rather resembling distributions .",
    "thus , neither galaxies in edge - on view nor galaxies with bars present statistical differences from the other normal galaxies in both mir properties . furthermore , although based on limited data points , one can still find out in figure  [ fig : edge.on ] that the edge - on galaxies can also be classified into early - type and late - type ones with the division criteria described in table  [ tab : type.division ] .",
    "therefore , the inclination of galaxies and the existence of bars do not affect our previous results .",
    "we have also checked the distributions of total sample of 154 galaxies in the above parameters and type comparisons , and yielded quite similar results , therefore the selection of this sub - sample does not affect the reliability of our statistical results .",
    "we investigated the correlations between the morphological types and the mir properties of a local optically flux - limited sample of galaxies selected from the spectroscopic catalogue of galaxies in sdss - dr4 , cross - correlated with the lockman hole , elais - n1 and elais - n2 of _ spitzer _ swire survey .",
    "aperture photometry has been performed on all these galaxies in all optical and mir bands .",
    "morphological classifications have been performed by both visual inspection and the bulge - disk decomposition with gim2d .",
    "our major results are as follows :    \\(1 ) the presented analysis clearly shows that the bulge - to - total ratio @xmath2 obtained by the bulge - disk decomposition is proved a qualified quantitative measure of the hubble @xmath6 types .",
    "galaxies with earlier morphological types possess larger bulge ratios while later type ones have more dominant disk structures .",
    "\\(2 ) the @xmath5 luminosity presents a tight correlation with the stellar mass , and this provides us a new tool to estimate the stellar mass .",
    "the empirical formula to calculate the stellar mass by the @xmath5 luminosity is given in equation  [ eqn : i1.mass ] .",
    "\\(3 ) except for the dwarf galaxies and a few peculiar objects , the mir dust luminosities of @xmath10 and @xmath4 exhibit correlations with either hubble @xmath6 type or the bulge - to - total ratio @xmath2 . such correlations are much more obvious if we used the mir dust - to - star ratios ( either @xmath87/\\nu l_{\\nu}[3.6\\mu m]$ ] or @xmath88/\\nu l_{\\nu}[3.6\\mu m]$ ] ) instead of the mir luminosities .",
    "\\(4 ) the mir dust luminosity ratios of @xmath89/\\nu l_{\\nu}[24\\mu m(dust)]$ ] turn to be roughly constant against the morphological types , especially for the late - type galaxies .",
    "therefore , on average , the @xmath10(dust ) luminosity can as reliably measure the global sfrs of normal galaxies as the @xmath31(dust ) luminosity can , regardless of the morphological types .",
    "\\(5 ) distributions of the mir dust luminosities and the mir dust - to - star ratios of both the early - type and the late - type galaxies are very different .",
    "the late - type galaxies present higher mir dust luminosities and mir dust - to - star ratios than the early - type galaxies .",
    "the mir dust luminosities of @xmath10 and @xmath4 and especially the mir dust - to - star ratios of @xmath90/\\nu l_{\\nu}[3.6\\mu m]$ ] and @xmath91/\\nu l_{\\nu}[3.6\\mu m]$ ] can provide an effective tool to distinguish the late - type galaxies from the early - types .",
    "\\(6 ) the star - forming galaxies and agns also present different statistical mir properties , with the former showing higher mir luminosities and mir dust - to - star ratios .",
    "the statistical results show that either galaxies in edge - on view or galaxies with bars do not present quite different mir properties from other sample galaxies .",
