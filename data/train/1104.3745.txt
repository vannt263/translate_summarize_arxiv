    "in this paper , we consider the quasihyperbolic metric , and its generalizations in both the @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space @xmath1 , and in banach spaces .",
    "first we give some motivation and historical background .",
    "quasihyperbolic metric can be viewed as a generalization of the hyperbolic metric .",
    "we start with an introduction to the hyperbolic metric and related results in function theory .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is a conformal mapping of the unit disk onto itself .",
    "then by pick s lemma we have the equality @xmath3 this identity can be written @xmath4 which means that for any regular curve @xmath5 in the unit disk @xmath6 , and for any conformal self mapping @xmath7 of @xmath8 , we have @xmath9 we have obtained a length function which is invariant under conformal mappings of the unit disk onto itself .",
    "this allows us to give the following definition .",
    "[ diskhyp ] let @xmath10 .",
    "then the _ hyperbolic distance _",
    "@xmath11 of @xmath12 is defined by @xmath13 where the infimum is taken over all regular curves @xmath5 connecting @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    obviously , the multiplier @xmath16 is harmless , and it is sometimes omitted . by the conformal invariance we can define the hyperbolic distance on any simply connected domain @xmath17 by the formula @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a conformal mapping .",
    "existence of such mapping is guaranteed by riemann s mapping theorem .",
    "note that definition [ diskhyp ] makes sense also in @xmath1 for all @xmath20 , if we consider instead of the unit disk @xmath8 the unit ball @xmath21 .",
    "however , for @xmath22 we have few conformal mappings , as by the generalized liouville theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) , every conformal mapping of a domain @xmath23 in the euclidean space @xmath1 , @xmath22 , is a restriction of a mbius transformation .",
    "thus , the domains of interest in higher dimensions are essentially the unit ball and the upper half - space @xmath24 .",
    "because formulas for mbius transformations of the unit ball @xmath25 onto @xmath26 are well known , we arrive to the following definitions .",
    "the hyperbolic distance between @xmath27 is defined by @xmath28 and between @xmath29 by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the family of all rectifiable paths joining @xmath32 and @xmath33 in @xmath25 or @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "it is well - known that the hyperbolic distance @xmath34 is a metric in the topological sense , i.e. , the following properties hold for @xmath35 :    1 .",
    "@xmath36 , 2 .",
    "@xmath37 , if and only if @xmath38 , 3 .",
    "@xmath39 , and 4 .",
    "@xmath40 ,    for all @xmath41 .",
    "the last condition is the triangle inequality .",
    "a curve @xmath5 is called a _",
    "geodesic _ of the metric @xmath42 if triangle inequality holds as an equality for all points @xmath43 on @xmath5 in that order .",
    "one may show that hyperbolic metric is always geodesic : for any @xmath44 there is a geodesic @xmath5 connecting @xmath45 , i.e. , the infimum in the integral is attained by @xmath5 . for the ball or half - space those geodesics are always circular arcs orthogonal to the boundary .",
    "further calculations allow us to obtain formulas for @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the closed form .",
    "the hyperbolic metrics in the upper half - plane @xmath48 and in the unit disk @xmath8 are also given by equations @xmath49 and @xmath50    hyperbolic metric is topologically equivalent to the one defined by the restriction of the euclidean norm : they define the same open sets .",
    "in fact , if @xmath23 is the unit ball , or its image in a mbius transformation , the hyperbolic balls @xmath51 are euclidean balls , although their hyperbolic center is not usually the same as the euclidean center .",
    "there are certain results which make the hyperbolic metric particularly interesting from the point of view of the geometric function theory .",
    "for example , many classical results from the euclidean geometry have hyperbolic analogues , such as the following hyperbolic form of pythagoras theorem :    [ pythagoras ] ( * ? ? ? * theorem 7.11.1 ) for a hyperbolic triangle with angles @xmath52 and corresponding hyperbolic opposite side lengths @xmath53 , we have @xmath54    here the hyperbolic triangle means the domain whose boundary consists of the hyperbolic geodesics connecting three points in the hyperbolic space . in particular , the hyperbolic distance is very useful in complex analysis . for example , we can prove the following version of the classical schwarz s lemma ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , this result does also have a complete analogy for quasiconformal mappings in @xmath1 , @xmath20 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath55 be analytic .",
    "then the following inequality holds for the hyperbolic distance @xmath56 where the equality holds if and only if @xmath7 is a mbius transformation .",
    "while the hyperbolic metric is a powerful tool in function theory , this approach also has two important limitations :    1 .   in @xmath1 , for @xmath22",
    ", the hyperbolic metric can not be defined for a domain which is not an image of the unit ball in a mbius transformation .",
    "2 .   even in the plane",
    ", there are no actual formulas for hyperbolic distance , except in the case of a few domains for which the riemann mapping can be found analytically .",
    "we would like to have a metric which could be defined for any domain of interest and which could be easily computed , or at least estimated .",
    "ideally , we would like this metric to be as similar to the hyperbolic metric as possible in other respects .",
    "this leads us the quasihyperbolic metric .",
    "the quasihyperbolic metric was first introduced by f.w .",
    "gehring and b.p .",
    "palka in 1976 @xcite , and it has been studied by numerous authors thereafter .",
    "let @xmath23 be a proper subdomain of the euclidean space @xmath1 , @xmath57 .",
    "we define the _ quasihyperbolic length _ of a rectifiable arc @xmath58 by @xmath59 the _ quasihyperbolic metric _ is defined by @xmath60 where the infimum is taken over all rectifiable curves in @xmath23 joining @xmath32 and @xmath33 . if the domain @xmath23 is clear from the context we use notation @xmath61 instead of @xmath62 .",
    "clearly , for @xmath63 the quasihyperbolic metric is the same as the hyperbolic metric , but in the case of the ball it is not .",
    "the quasihyperbolic metric of the ball is connected to the hyperbolic metric by the following inequalities ( see @xcite ) : @xmath64    obviously , it follows that quasihyperbolic metric is not , in general , invariant under conformal mappings , not even in mbius transformations .",
    "however , we have the following result :    @xcite if @xmath65 are proper subdomains of @xmath1 and @xmath66 is a mbius transformation , then @xmath67 for all @xmath44 .",
    "the proof of the above was first given by gehring and palka @xcite , where a generalization of the result for quasiconformal mappings was also obtained .    in the case of the hyperbolic metric , it is easy to characterize the geodesics of this metric at least in the case of the ball and half - space . the properties , or even existence , of quasihyperbolic geodesics is not immediately clear , and they have been studied by several authors . in @xmath1",
    "it is , however , true that quasihyperbolic metric is always geodesic .",
    "even this is not true in the more general setting of banach spaces which we will consider later in this paper .",
    "their results already reveal that the quasihyperbolic metric is useful in study of geometric geometric function theory , but one crucial problem remains .",
    "while the quasihyperbolic metric is easy to define , we do not yet have any effective estimates for it .",
    "for this reason , we need yet another definition .",
    "the _ distance ratio metric _ or _",
    "@xmath68-metric _ in a proper subdomain @xmath23 of the euclidean space @xmath1 , @xmath57 , is defined by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the euclidean distance between @xmath32 and @xmath71 .    again , if the domain @xmath23 is clear from the context , we use notation @xmath68 instead of @xmath72 .",
    "the distance ratio metric by f.w .",

    "osgood in 1979 @xcite .",
    "the above form for the distance ratio metric was introduced by m. vuorinen @xcite .",
    "a useful inequality connecting this the @xmath68-metric to the quasihyperbolic metric is the following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.1 ) : @xmath73 an inequality to the other direction does not , in general , hold .",
    "for example , one may consider the slit plane @xmath74 , and two points @xmath75 , where @xmath76 . when @xmath77 and @xmath78 remains fixed the @xmath68-metric distance of the points does not change , but the quasihyperbolic distance of the points goes to infinity .",
    "if the inequality @xmath79 holds for all @xmath44 where @xmath80 is a constant , then we say that the domain @xmath23 is _",

    "there is a natural way to define an integral @xmath254 of a measurable function @xmath7 , called the _ bochner integral _ : @xmath255 where the limit is taken in the norm , if @xmath256 this definition is well set as it does not depend on the selection of the sequence @xmath249 .    a banach space @xmath241 has the rnp if and only if each lipschitz path @xmath257\\to { \\mathrm{x}}$ ] is gteaux differentiable almost everywhere .",
    "in such a case one can represent such a path @xmath5 as a bochner integral of its gteaux derivative by the formula @xmath258 where @xmath259}(t)f(t)\\ dt$ ] .",
    "reflexive spaces and separable dual spaces have the rnp .",
    "the rnp is a kind of convexity property , which does not allow too much flatness on the unit sphere .",
    "given two banach space properties @xmath260 and @xmath261 , we say that @xmath260 is a _",
    "dual property _ of @xmath261 if @xmath260 of @xmath262 implies @xmath261 of @xmath241 .",
    "for example , rnp is a dual property for another property of banach spaces , called asplund .",
    "a banach space is asplund if each of its separable subspaces has separable dual . as noted , the rnp is a kind of convexity property , whereas asplund is a kind of smoothness property , which yields that the norm is a frchet differentiable function in a dense set of points .",
    "the unit ball of @xmath263 is a non - typical one , it is a square , and thus it barely deserves to be called a ball .",
    "two things to observe are that it has flat sides and sharp corners .",
    "this is to say that the space is not _ strictly convex _ and not _",
    "smooth_. in order to bypass some pathological behaviour of banach spaces , one would like to ensure convexity and smoothness of the unit ball , not just looking at some particular points ( like corners above ) but instead the whole asymptotics of the ball .",
    "this is in particular necessary when one desires to form estimates involving smoothness of the norm non - specific to a certain location of the unit ball .",
    "next , we will present two moduli related to the geometry of banach spaces .",
    "the _ modulus of convexity _",
    "@xmath264 is defined by @xmath265 and the _ modulus of smoothness _",
    "@xmath266 is defined by @xmath267 the banach space @xmath241 is called _ uniformly convex _ if @xmath268 for all @xmath269 , and _ uniformly smooth _ if @xmath270 the modulus of convexity measures the maximum distance to the boundary form a point of a cord of length @xmath271 inside the unit ball .",
    "thus the unit ball of a uniformly convex space is round ( meaning non - flat ) in all directions and this roundness is controlled by the modulus @xmath272 . in getting acquainted with the notion of uniform smoothness , it is perhaps worthwhile to calculate the modulus of smoothness for @xmath239 , which is the function @xmath273 .    moreover , a space @xmath241 is uniformly convex ( resp .",
    "uniformly smooth ) of power type @xmath274 if @xmath275 ( resp .",
    "@xmath276 ) for some @xmath277 .",
    "the power type @xmath278 relates the smoothness / convexity of the space @xmath241 to that of the spaces @xmath226 .",
    "the power types @xmath279 of smoothness and @xmath278 of convexity satisfy @xmath280 .",
    "in fact , hilbert spaces ( corresponding to the case @xmath281 ) are both uniformly convex and uniformly smooth and moreover have _ the _ best possible modulus functions of convexity and smoothness .",
    "spaces linearly homeomorphic to a uniformly smooth or a uniformly convex space are ( super)reflexive .",
    "an example of a banach space , which is reflexive , strictly convex and smooth , but not superreflexive , is @xmath282",
    "some previous work will be treated here ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "next we will summarize the main results in @xcite .",
    "first , in the @xmath68-metric , balls are starlike for radii @xmath283 :    [ thm : sl ] let @xmath241 be a banach space , @xmath284 a domain , and let @xmath68 be the distance ratio metric on @xmath23 .",
    "then each @xmath68-ball @xmath285 is starlike for radii @xmath286 .",
    "the following theorem is a generalization of a result of martio and visl @xcite :    [ thm : cd ] let @xmath241 be a banach space and @xmath284 a convex domain .",
    "then all quasihyperbolic balls and @xmath68-balls on @xmath23 are convex . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath23 is uniformly convex , or if @xmath241 is strictly convex and has the rnp , then these balls are strictly convex .",
    "if @xmath23 is starlike with respect to @xmath287 , then all quasihyperbolic and @xmath68-metric balls centered at @xmath288 are starlike as well .",
    "[ thm_starlike_starlike ] let @xmath241 be banach space , @xmath243 and let @xmath289 be a domain which is starlike with respect to @xmath247",
    ". then all balls @xmath290 and @xmath291 of @xmath23 are starlike .",
    "finally , we note that in @xcite ( see theorem [ quasiconv - k2 ] ) critical radii are provided for the convexity of quasihyperbolic and @xmath68-balls on punctured @xmath234 .",
    "again , it is a natural question whether the existence of such radii can be established , in the banach space setting    in order to check the convexity of a @xmath61-ball in a punctured space it would seem natural to exploit an averaging argument similar to the proof of theorem [ thm : cd ] .",
    "we have obtained the following partial result which comes very close to providing such a device :    [ lm : qhlemma ]",
    "let @xmath241 be a banach space , which is uniformly convex and uniformly smooth , both moduli being of power type @xmath16 .",
    "we consider the quasihyperbolic metric @xmath61 on @xmath292 .",
    "then there exists @xmath293 as follows .",
    "assume that @xmath294\\to \\omega$ ] are rectifiable paths satisfying the following conditions :    1 .",
