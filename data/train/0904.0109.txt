    "the construction of authentication codes is an important topic in cryptography , and has been considered by many researchers over the last few decades .",
    "the first construction of such codes go back to gilbert , macwilliams and sloane  @xcite , using finite projective planes .    in this paper",
    ", we consider combinatorial constructions for codes providing authentication and secrecy for equiprobable source probability distributions . for general authentication codes without any secrecy requirements , there exist various constructions for a long time , regardless of the source distribution . however , if we wish that the authentication codes simultaneously provide for secrecy , then there are only a few constructions known , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "these constructions are mostly of combinatorial nature , using combinatorial @xmath0-designs , perpendicular arrays , or orthogonal arrays . an algebraic approach  @xcite",
    "is based on ( non-)linear functions between finite abelian groups .",
    "in particular , stinson  @xcite constructed in 1990 optimal authentication codes that are one - fold secure against spoofing and achieve perfect secrecy .",
    "his constructions rely on steiner and assume that the source states are equiprobable distributed ( cf .  theorems  [ stin1 ] and  [ stin2 ] ) .",
    "we will extend stinson s constructions to obtain optimal codes which are multi - fold secure against spoofing and provide perfect secrecy .",
    "this can be achieved by means of steiner for larger @xmath0 . using mbius planes , and more generally spherical geometries",
    ", we will particularly construct a new infinite class of optimal codes which are two - fold secure against spoofing and achieve perfect secrecy ( section  [ new ] ) .",
    "several further new optimal codes satisfying these properties will be constructed and presented in general tables ( section  [ table ] ) .",
    "almost all of these appear to be the first authentication codes with these properties .",
    "the paper uses concepts from both combinatorial design theory and the theory of authentication codes .",
    "relevant definitions will be summarized ( sections  [ auth ] and  [ des ] ) as well as results on general authentication codes that are important for our purposes ( section  [ genauth ] ) . the paper concludes with a discussion on further research directions ( section  [ disc ] ) .",
    "we rely on the unconditional ( theoretical ) secrecy model developed by shannon  @xcite , and by simmons ( e.g.  @xcite ) including authentication .",
    "we follow the description and notion of  @xcite .",
    "we also mention the recent reference work  @xcite .    in this model of authentication and secrecy",
    "three participants are involved : a _ transmitter _ , a _ receiver _ , and an _ opponent_. the transmitter wants to communicate information to the receiver via a public communications channel .",
    "the receiver in return would like to be confident that any received information actually came from the transmitter and not from some opponent ( _ integrity _ of information ) .",
    "the transmitter and the receiver are assumed to trust each other .",
    "sometimes this is also called an _",
    "@xmath1-code_.    let @xmath2 denote a set of @xmath3 _ source states _",
    "( or _ plaintexts _ ) , @xmath4 a set of @xmath5 _ messages _ ( or _ ciphertexts _ ) , and @xmath6 a set of @xmath7 _ encoding rules _ ( or _ keys _ ) . using an encoding rule @xmath8 ,",
    "the transmitter encrypts a source state @xmath9 to obtain the message @xmath10 to be sent over the channel .",
    "the encoding rule is an injective function from @xmath2 to @xmath4 , and is communicated to the receiver via a secure channel prior to any messages being sent . for each encoding rule @xmath11 ,",
    "let @xmath12 denote the set of _ valid _ messages .",
    "a received message @xmath13 will be accepted by the receiver as being authentic if and only if @xmath14 . when this is fulfilled , the receiver decrypts the message @xmath13 by applying the decoding rule @xmath15 , where @xmath16 an authentication code can be represented algebraically by a @xmath17__-encoding matrix _ _ with the rows indexed by the encoding rules , the columns indexed by the source states , and the entries defined by @xmath18 ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) .",
    "we are interested in the following scenario , which is called _ spoofing attack _ of order @xmath21 : suppose that an opponent observes @xmath22 distinct messages , which are sent through the public channel using the same encoding rule .",
    "the opponent then inserts a new message @xmath23 ( being distinct from the @xmath21 messages already sent ) , hoping to have it accepted by the receiver as authentic .",
    "the cases @xmath24 and @xmath25 are called _ impersonation game _ and _ substitution game _ , respectively .",
    "these cases have been studied in detail in recent years , whereas less is known for the cases @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that there are probability distributions @xmath27 on @xmath2 and @xmath28 on @xmath6 ( known to all participants ) with associated independent random variables @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "these distributions induce a third distribution , @xmath31 , on @xmath4 with associated random variable @xmath32 .",
    "the _ deception probability _ @xmath33 is the probability that the opponent can deceive the receiver with a spoofing attack of order @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath34massey@xmath35 $ ] in an authentication code with @xmath3 source states and @xmath5 messages , the deception probabilities are bounded below by @xmath36    an authentication code is called @xmath0__-fold secure against spoofing _ _ if @xmath37 for @xmath38 .    in what follows ,",
    "we are also interested in the property of secrecy : an authentication code is said to have _ perfect secrecy _ if @xmath39 for every source state @xmath9 and every message @xmath40 .",
    "that is , the _ a posteriori _ probability that the source state is @xmath41 , given that the message @xmath13 is observed , is identical to the _ a priori _ probability that the source state is @xmath41 .",
    "it can easily be shown that @xmath42 as a consequence , we have    @xmath34stinson@xmath35$][frequency ] an authentication code has perfect secrecy if and only if @xmath43 for every source state @xmath41 and every message @xmath13 .",
    "thus , if the encoding rules in a code are used with equal probability , then a given message @xmath13 occurs with the same frequency in each column of the encoding matrix .",
    "for positive integers @xmath44 and @xmath45 , a @xmath46 is a pair , satisfying the following properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath47 is a set of @xmath5 elements , called _",

    "we will denote points by lower - case and blocks by upper - case latin letters . via convention , let @xmath49 denote the number of blocks . throughout this article , ` repeated blocks ' are not allowed , that is , the same of points may not occur twice as a block .",
    "if @xmath50 holds , then we speak of a _ non - trivial _ . for historical reasons ,",
    "a with @xmath51 is called a _ steiner _",
    "( sometimes also a _ steiner system _ ) . as a simple example , let us choose as point set @xmath52 and as block set @xmath53 this gives a steiner , the well - known _ fano plane _ , which is the smallest design arising from a projective geometry .",
    "the usual representation of this unique projective plane of order @xmath54 is given by the following diagram :    [ fano ]    ( 0,0.87 ) circle ( 24.4pt ) ;    ( 0,0 ) circle ( 2pt ) ( 0,-0.3 ) node 7    ( -1.5,0 ) circle ( 2pt ) ( -1.52,-0.3 ) node 1    ( 1.5,0 ) circle ( 2pt ) ( 1.52,-0.3 ) node 3    ( 0,0.87 ) circle ( 2pt ) ( 0.12,1.15 ) node 6    ( 0,2.6 ) circle(2pt ) ( 0,2.9 ) node 2    ( 0.75,1.31 ) circle ( 2pt ) ( 0.95,1.35 ) node 5    ( -0.75,1.31 ) circle(2pt ) ( -0.95,1.35 ) node 4 ;    ( 1.5,0 ) ",

    "then the number of blocks containing each element of @xmath29 is given by @xmath60 in particular , for @xmath61 , a design is also an design .",

    "does there exist any non - trivial steiner with @xmath71 ?",
    "for _ general _ authentication codes , no secrecy requirements are specified .",
