    "properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei have been described with great success by relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models in recent years @xcite .",
    "these models provide a novel saturation mechanism , an explanation of the strong spin - orbit interaction , and a natural energy dependence of the optical potential .",
    "they are often referred to as quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) since nuclear systems are described in these quantum field theories in terms of interacting hadrons , i.e.  nucleon and meson fields .",
    "lagrangians have been proposed in simple versions about 25 years ago @xcite , and since then there have been many different treatments , extensions and applications .",
    "there are basically two approaches of qhd , which one may call microscopic and phenomenological , respectively .",
    "the microscopic method is the dirac - brueckner ( db ) approach which tries to connect nucleon - nucleon scattering with finite nuclear systems via many - body theory .",
    "the effective lagrangian has a simple form where nucleons and mesons couple in a minimal way .",
    "the coupling constants are fitted to nn scattering observables via the relativistic t - matrix approach .",
    "then nuclear matter is treated in the brueckner approximation and an effective in - medium interaction is extracted .",
    "the relativistic brueckner approach successfully achieves saturation for nuclear matter which was not possible in non - relativistic methods with only two - body forces .",
    "nucleon self energies @xmath0 ( @xmath1 scalar , vector , tensor ,  ) in the db approach are both density and momentum dependent . below the fermi momentum @xmath2 the momentum dependence is found to be not very strong but above @xmath2 it corresponds to the momentum dependence in the empirical optical potential . while the db method is very successful in describing infinite nuclear matter , it is very difficult to apply to finite nuclei without drastic approximations , e.g. the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "in order to describe detailed properties of finite nuclei some adjustements have to be introduced @xcite .    in the phenomenological approach qhd",
    "is applied directly to nuclear systems without reference to nn scattering .",
    "simple many - body approximations , usually the mean field approximation without exchange and correlation contributions , are employed .",
    "the coupling strengths of the mesons are directly adjusted to saturation properties of nuclear matter . in the original approach proposed by walecka @xcite",
    "the self energies are proportional to the corresponding densities .",
    "it was found that in this approach with linear meson - nucleon couplings properties of nuclear matter are not satisfactory away from saturation ( too large incompressibility and too small effective mass ) and finite nuclei are not described well . in order to improve the description the qhd lagrangian has to be extended to include medium and state dependent effects in an effective way .",
    "this has been achieved by adding non - linear and higher order interaction terms to the lagrangian or assuming density - dependent couplings of the nucleon and meson fields .",
    "non - linear models are the most prominent approach , in which cubic and quartic self - interactions of the @xmath3-meson are introduced .",
    "this extension was proposed by boguta and bodmer @xcite in order to lower the incompressibility of nuclear matter . later",
    "the approach was extended to other meson fields @xcite .",
    "various parametrizations have been introduced which provide a good description of a whole range of nuclei @xcite . replacing the minimal coupling of the @xmath3-meson to the nucleon by a derivative coupling , zimanyi and moszkowski ( zm ) obtained a particular non - linear @xmath3-coupling after rescaling of the nucleon field @xcite .",
    "although this approach leads to a small incompressibility of nuclear matter , the effective nucleon mass turns out to be rather large , and , correspondingly , the spin - orbit interaction is too small . the zm model with further extensions",
    "was studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "recently , this class of approaches has been put on a more systematic basis in the effective field theories ( eft ) where the possible terms and their importance are systematically categorized @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach assumes a density dependence of the coupling vertices @xcite .",
    "this extension is suggested by db theory .",
    "however , in a thermodynamically consistent and lorentz covariant model , the couplings can not depend parametrically on the density .",
    "they have to be lorentz - scalar functionals of the field operators .",
    "then the euler - lagrange variational equations lead to so - called rearragement contributions in the self - energies .",
    "the first serious parametrization for finite nuclei was developed in @xcite where a dependence of the couplings on the vector density ( vdd ) was found to work best .",
    "it was shown that good results can be obtained in the whole chart of nuclei , comparable to the best non - linear models .",
    "recently , a new parametrization within the vdd approach has been developed @xcite .",
    "these models can be considered in the general framework of density - functional theory which is given here in terms of the density dependent vertex functions .",
    "this connection is rather close , since the density dependence is motivated by db theory which includes exchange and correlation terms .",
    "generally it seems desirable to describe the structure of nuclei and nuclear reactions in a common framework .",
    "this implies that one also needs the momentum dependence of the self energies at least for momenta above the fermi surface .",
    "empirically these are well studied in dirac phenomenology by fitting scalar and vector potentials to elastic proton nucleus scattering data @xcite .",
    "it is found that the optical potential becomes repulsive with increasing energy but levels off at about 1  gev .",
    "optical potentials extracted from standard rmf models are much too large and increase linearly at high energies .",
    "recently , a reasonable description of proton - nucleus scattering and an improved optical potential has been obtained by multiplying the self - energies from rmf calculations of finite nuclei with functions that depend explicitly on the proton energy @xcite . however , the consistency of the theory is lost and the change of the energy dependence at different medium densities is not properly taken into account in this approach .",
    "the momentum dependence of the interaction also becomes important in the description of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "several parametrizations for a parametric momentum dependence of the potentials have been developed in different approaches @xcite .",
    "so far , extensions of the rmf models concentrated on the effective density dependence of the in - medium interaction since they were mostly applied to the description of finite nuclei .",
    "if one goes beyond the mean field approximation momentum dependent self energies will emerge naturally .",
    "recently , it was shown , that an energy - dependence of the self - energies can improve the level density close to the fermi surface of finite nuclei @xcite . in this rmf model ,",
    "dynamical effects from the coupling of the single particle motion to collective surface vibrations are taken into account in a phenomenological approach .",
    "however , the energy - dependence was introduced only parametrically into the self - energies destroying the covariance of the theory . in order to retain",
    "the simple structure of the equations known from the rmf approximation one can imagine that it is desirable to modify the qhd lagrangian in such a way that it leads to momentum dependent self energies already in the mean field approximation . in this work",
    "we propose such a class of lagrangians with generalized derivative meson - nucleon couplings .",
    "the various types of possible couplings will have characteristic consequences in the field equations . here",
    "we limit ourselves to the study of infinite nuclear matter within the derivative coupling ( dc ) model in order to demonstrate the main effects and the limitations of the approach .",
    "the results can serve as a foundation for a later application of the model to finite nuclei .",
    "although derivative couplings have been investigated in simple approaches before , they were essentially cast into density - dependent forms , e.g.  by rescaling the fields as in the zm model . in eft models contributions containing derivatives of the density",
    "are included , but generally they do not lead to a momentum dependence of the self energies and they do not affect properties of nuclear matter .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] the the lagrangian of the dc model is introduced and the field equation for mesons and nucleons are derived in the mean field approximation . in the following section the dc model is applied to infinite nuclear matter and expressions for basic quantities are derived .",
    "three parametrizations are developed in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] and the resulting properties of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter are compared to standard rmf models .",
    "finally , we summarize and give an outlook in sec.[sec5 ] .",
    "the description of nuclear systems in qhd starts from a lagrangian density @xmath4 that contains nucleons and mesons as degrees of freedom . in case of symmetric nuclear matter",
    "it is sufficient to include isoscalar @xmath3- and @xmath5-mesons .",
    "however , for asymmetric matter and finite nuclei , isovector mesons have to be added .",
    "it is customary to consider only the vector @xmath6-meson but for the sake of completeness we also take the scalar @xmath7-meson into account .",
    "the standard approach is to couple the nucleons minimally to the mesons . in case of the isoscalar mesons",
    "this leads to vertices of the form @xmath8 and @xmath9 corresponding to the linear walecka model .",
    "the idea of the dc model is to introduce explicit couplings of the mesons to the first derivative of the nucleon field @xmath10 , e.g. @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "the derivate @xmath13 in the new coupling vertices is actually replaced by the covariant derivative @xmath14 as it appears in the usual kinetic contribution to the lagrangian . in the current model",
    "we consider couplings to the covariant derivative of the nucleon field which are linear or quadratic in the @xmath3- and @xmath5-meson fields .",
    "for simplicity for the @xmath7- and @xmath6-mesons only linear couplings are taken into account .",
    "of course , the standard minimal couplings are retained in the dc model .    on these conditions the lagrangian density in the dc model assumes the form @xmath15   -   \\bar{\\psi }",

    "the term @xmath35 is similar to the extension of the zm model and leads to a density dependence of the effective self energies .",
    "as will be seen later , the terms @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the essential terms to give a momentum dependence to the scalar and vector self energies , respectively .",
    "since the covariant derivative is used in ( [ lagdef ] ) , there appear also higher order nonlinear couplings to the nucleon field in the lagrangian density .",
    "in addition to the four coupling constants @xmath20 in @xmath4 specifying the minimal nucleon - meson couplings , seven new couplings constants ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) appear . for the sake of convenience ,",
    "mass factors are introduced to obtain pure numbers for the new coupling constants .",
    "the large number of new couplings makes the lagrangian of the dc model very flexible .",
    "if the new coupling constants vanish the matrix @xmath45 ( [ newgam ] ) reduces to the usual @xmath24 matrix and we recover the original qhd lagrangian density with only mininal couplings . in comparison to the widely employed models with non - linear selfcouplings of the @xmath3-meson ( @xmath3-meson and @xmath5-meson )",
    "there are five ( four ) additional free parameters in the dc model .",
    "the non - linear or density - dependent rmf models discussed in the introduction are not a simple subcase of the present dc models .",
    "they could be included by making the couplings @xmath20 density - dependent or replacing them by polynomials in @xmath3 and @xmath46 .",
    "we do not want ot make this further extension .",
    "as will be seen later , the higher order terms in eqs.([wwdef ] ) and ( [ xxdef ] ) produce similar effects as such additional terms .",
    "the field equations of nucleons and mesons are derived from the corresponding euler - lagrange equations . in the mean field approximation the meson fields",
    "are treated as classical fields by replacing them with their expectation values .",
    "only positive energy states of the nucleons are taken into account in the calculation of the densities ( no - sea approximation ) .",
    "symmetries of the nuclear system can lead to a considerable simplification the equations in the actual calculation , e.g. in infinite nuclear matter .",

    "<S> the quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) model with minimal nucleon - meson couplings is generalized by introducing couplings of mesons to derivatives of the nucleon field in the lagrangian density . </S>",
    "<S> this approach allows an effective description of a state - dependent in - medium interaction in the mean - field approximation . </S>",
    "<S> various parametrizations for the generalized couplings are developed and applied to infinite nuclear matter . in this approach , scalar and vector nucleon self - energies </S>",
    "<S> depend on both density and momentum similarly as in the dirac - brueckner theory . </S>",
    "<S> the schrdinger - equivalent optical potential is much less repulsive at high nucleon energies as compared to standard relativistic mean field models and thus agrees better with experimental findings . </S>",
    "<S> the derivative couplings in the extended model have significant effects on the properties of symmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter . </S>"
