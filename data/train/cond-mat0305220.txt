    "x - ray reflectivity and offspecular diffuse scattering methods have been widely applied over the last decade to characterize the morphology of rough surfaces and interfaces , particularly with the availability of sources of ever - increasing brilliance for x - ray radiation .",
    "similar techniques using neutron beams have also become widespread , particularly for the study of magnetic multilayers . in the case of x - rays , however , element - specific information regarding the magnetic structure can be readily obtained by tuning the photon energy to that of an l - edge ( in the case of transition or rare - earth metals)@xcite or of an m - edge ( in the case of actinides).@xcite the resonant enhancement of the scattering by magnetic atoms at such energies can result in a large enough signal to be comparable to the dominant charge scattering .",
    "resonant x - ray scattering at the k - edges of transition metals@xcite has also been used to obtain information about the magnetic structure , although the enhancement is not as large .",
    "resonant magnetic scattering corresponds to the real part of the scattering amplitude , while the ( absorptive ) imaginary part gives rise to x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) , which has been used to obtain the values of spin and orbital moments in ferromagnetic materials .",
    "detailed descriptions of the formalism for the interaction of x - rays with magnetically polarized atoms have been given in the literature,@xcite from which a complete description of magneto - optic phenomena in the x - ray region can be obtained and applied .",
    "several resonant x - ray specular reflectivity experiments have been performed to obtain the magnetization within the layers of magnetic multilayers.@xcite the analysis of these results has generally used recursive matrix techniques developed for magneto - optics in the case of resonant x - ray reflectivity.@xcite in general , roughness at the interfaces has been ignored or taken into account in an ad - hoc manner . in principle , representing roughness in terms of a graded magnetization at the interface and using slicing methods could enable one to calculate the effect of magnetic roughness on specular reflectivity at the expense of considerable computational effort .",
    "rhlsberger has developed a matrix formalism ( originally developed for nuclear resonant x - ray reflectivity ) from which specular reflectivity incorporating roughness can be calculated.@xcite it was not considered in his paper , however , that the magnetic interfaces can have different roughnesses from the structural ( chemical ) ones . in this paper , we define separately a structural and a magnetic interface to represent the actual interfaces and present analytical formulae taking into account both interface roughnesses , which provide much faster computational method than the slicing methods and show good agreement with established formulae for chemical interface roughness .",
    "methods were developed earlier to calculate analytically the specular component of the charge scattering of x - rays by rough surfaces and interfaces using the born approximation ( ba ) and the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba).@xcite the ba results were extended to magnetic interfaces in an earlier publication@xcite and have already been applied to interpreting x - ray resonant magnetic specular reflectivity measurements from magnetic multilayers.@xcite however , the ba or the kinematical approximation breaks down in the vicinity of the critical angle and below , since it neglects the x - ray refraction . on the other hand , the dwba takes account of dynamical effects , such as multiple scattering and the x - ray refraction , which become significant for smaller angles close to the critical angle and even for greater angles at the resonant energies or with soft x - rays .",
    "we present here the generalization of the dwba to the case of resonant magnetic x - ray reflectivity from rough magnetic surfaces or interfaces .",
    "the principal complication is , however , that we now have to deal with a tensor ( rather than scalar ) scattering length , or equivalently an anisotropic refractive index for x - rays.@xcite this leads in general to two transmitted and two reflected waves at each interface for arbitrary polarization , which complicates the dwba formalism .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss a simple conceptual model for a magnetic interface and its relationship to the chemical ( i.e. , structural ) interface and define the appropriate magnetic roughness parameters . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the ( known ) scattering amplitudes for resonant x - ray scattering and their relationship to the dielectric susceptibility to be used in the dwba . in sec .",
    "iv , we present the derivation of the scattering in the dwba for a single interface with both structural and magnetic roughnesses . in secs .",
    "v and vi , we derive the formulae for specular reflectivity from a magnetic interface using the self - consistent method in the framework of the dwba and discuss numerical results . finally , in secs .",
    "vii - ix , we discuss the extension of the formalism to the case of the specular reflectivity from magnetic multilayers and present some numerical results with experimental data from a gd / fe multilayer . in the following paper,@xcite",
    "we derive the formulae for the diffuse ( off - specular ) scattering from magnetic interfaces in both the ba and the dwba .",
    "consider an interface between a ferromagnetic medium and a nonmagnetic medium ( which could also be free space ) . due to the roughness of this interface ,",
    "the magnetic moments near the interface will find themselves in anisotropy and exhange fields , which fluctuate spatially ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    this will produce disorder relative to the preferred ferromagnetic alignment within the magnetic medium .",
    "a similar situation can arise at an interface between a ferromagnetic medium ( fm ) and an antiferromagnetic medium ( afm ) , where there is a strong antiferromagnetic coupling between spins in the fm and the afm .",
    "random steps will then produce frustration in the vicinity of the interface , resulting in random disordering of the magnetic moments near the interface .",
    "clearly in general correlation will exist between the height fluctuations of the chemical interface and the fluctuations of the spins , but a quantitative formalism to account for this in detail has not yet been developed .",
    "we make here the simplifying assumption that the ferromagnetic moments near the interface ( or at least their components in the direction of the ferromagnetic moments deep within the fm layer , i.e. , the direction of average magnetization @xmath0 ) are cut off at a mathematical interface , which we call the magnetic interface and which may not coincide with the chemical interface , either in its height fluctuations or over its average position , e.g. , if a magnetic `` dead layer '' exists between the two interfaces ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the disorder near the interface is thus represented by height fluctuations of this magnetic interface .",
    "the basis for this assumption , which is admittedly crude , is that the short ( i.e. , atomic ) length - scale fluctuations of the moments away from the direction of the average magnetization give rise to diffuse scattering at fairly large scattering wave vectors , whereas we are dealing here with scattering at a small wave vector @xmath1 , which represent the relatively slow variations of the average magnetization density .",
    "the actual interface can be then considered as really composed of two interfaces , a chemical interface and a magnetic interface , each with their own average height , roughness , and correlation length , and , importantly , in general possessing correlated height fluctuations .",
    "the amplitude for resonant magnetic scattering of x - rays has been derived by hannon et al.,@xcite and a discussion of the general formalism may be found in the review by hill and mcmorrow.@xcite there are two cases of practical importance , namely dipole and quadrupole resonances .",
