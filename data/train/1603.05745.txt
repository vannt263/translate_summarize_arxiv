    "the characterisation of exoplanet atmospheres , particularly with ground based telescopes , is a difficult task .",
    "polarimetry offers a useful approach , providing a strong contrast between the star and planet as the star s light is typically unpolarized @xcite .",
    "large and tightly orbiting hot jupiter planets scatter enough light to potentially produce a polarisation signal dependent largely upon the composition of the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the detection of linearly polarized light from an exoplanet system can provide information about a planet s orbital orientation and about the properties of the particles that scatter the light in its atmosphere .",
    "the technique therefore provides complementary information to other characterisation techniques such as transit and eclipse spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite modelled the expected polarization levels for hot jupiter - type systems and predicted that linear polarization varying over the orbital cycle at the tens of parts - per - million level might be present in the combined light of the star and planet .",
    "since sun - like stars are thought to generally have low polarizations @xcite this technique provides good contrast and should be achievable from ground - based observations .",
    "past attempts at polarized light detection such as those described in @xcite have not detected significant planetary polarization signals .",
    "the hd 189733 hot jupiter system @xcite is one of the brightest and best studied transiting exoplanet systems .",
    "observations of transits and eclipses of hd 189733b using the hubble space telescope have shown strong evidence for a rayleigh scattering haze in its atmosphere , which shows up as increasing absorption towards shorter wavelengths in the transit spectrum @xcite as well as reflected light seen in the secondary eclipse at blue wavelengths @xcite .",
    "this makes hd 189733b a promising target for polarimetric observations .",
    "however , polarization observations of this system to date have produced conflicting results .",
    "@xcite reported an unexpectedly high level of polarization variation of @xmath1200 ppm ( parts - per - million ) from the hd 189733 exoplanet system using the dipol instrument @xcite at la palma s kva ( royal swedish academy of sciences ) telescope .",
    "subsequently @xcite reported no polarization variation with an upper limit of 79 ppm ( 99 per cent confidence ) using the polish instrument .",
    "further observations @xcite using turpol @xcite on the nordic optical telescope in three bands showed a polarization signal in the _ u _ and _ b _ bands but not in the _ v _ band .",
    "they argued that the non - detection by @xcite was due to the use of too red a band .",
    "the amplitude reported in the _ b _ band was 100 @xmath0 10 ppm .",
    "the polarization was attributed to rayleigh scattering from the planet s atmosphere .",
    "more recently @xcite have reported _ b _ band polarization measurements of hd 189733 using the polish2 instrument on the lick observatory 3-m telescope .",
    "they set a limit on the _ b _ band polarization amplitude of 60 ppm ( 99.7 per cent confidence ) .",
    "this paper presents the most sensitive measurements of the system to date using a blue broadband filter in an attempt to distinguish between these conflicting results .",
    "hd 189733 was observed during three observing runs on the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) at siding spring observatory , new south wales , australia .",
    "the observations were made with the high precision polarimetric instrument ( hippi)@xcite . the dates of observations were 2014 aug 28 - 31 , 2015 may 23 , 26 and jun 26 .",
    "hippi is an aperture polarimeter using a ferroelectric liquid crystal ( flc ) modulator , a wollaston prism analyser and two photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) as detectors .",
    "the flc provides a 500 hz primary modulation which is used together with two additional stages of slower modulation obtained by rotation of the wollaston prism and detectors , and finally by rotating the whole instrument to four position angles ( 0 , 45 , 90 , 135 degress ) using the aat s cassegrain rotator .",
    "hippi has been shown from repeat observations of bright low polarization stars to deliver a precision of 4.3 @xmath2 10@xmath3 ( 4.3 parts - per - million or ppm ) or better @xcite .",
    "this is comparable to or better than the precisions reported from polarimeters based on photoelastic modulators such as the pine mountain observatory polarimeter @xcite , planetpol @xcite , polish @xcite and polish2 @xcite .",
    "hippi uses hamamatsu h10720 - 210 pmt modules that have ultra - bialkali photocathodes with a peak quantum efficiency of 43 per cent at 400 nm .",
    "the hd 189733 observations were made through a 500 nm short pass filter ( referred to as 500sp ) to exclude any red light from the k 1.5 v star .",
    "the overall bandpass covers 350 to 500 nm ( the polarization optics cut off light below 350 nm ) and the effective wavelength calculated from the bandpass model described by @xcite is 446.1 nm .",
    "this is a similar but somewhat broader band than the _ b _ band used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the moonlit sky can contribute a significant polarized background signal within our 6.7 diameter aperture .",
    "the 2014 august observations were all made with lunar illumination phases less than 35 per cent but with the moon near 90@xmath4 seperation from hd 189733b where rayleigh scattering is at a maximum .",
    "the 2015 observations were all made after the moon had set .",
    "any residual background signal is subtracted from the data using a sky observation made immediately after each science observation at each cassegrain rotator position .",
    "the telescope introduces a small polarization ( telescope polarization or tp ) that must be corrected for .",
    "as described in @xcite we determine the tp using observations of a number of stars we believe to have very low polarization either based on previous planetpol observations @xcite or because of their small distances and expected low levels of interstellar polarization ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the telescope polarization has been found to be stable during each run , and between the 2015 may and june runs , but changed signficantly from 2014 to 2015 , probably as a result of the realuminization of the aat primary mirror in early 2015 .",
    "determinations of tp in the sdss g@xmath5 filter are reported in @xcite and @xcite giving values of 48 @xmath0 5 ppm in 2014 , and 36 @xmath0 1 ppm in 2015 .",
    "we have also made a smaller number of tp observations directly in the 500sp filter used with hd  189733 as listed in table [ tab_tp ] .",
    "these observations consistently show telescope polarizations of 22 to 25 per cent higher values than the more extensive @xmath6 band observations .",
    ".low polarization star measurements to determine telescope polarization ( tp ) in the 500sp filter .",
    "the adopted tp for the august 2014 and may 2015 runs use only measurements acquired on that run .",
    "the june 2015 run uses measurements from both may and june 2015 . [ cols=\"<,<,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab_fit ]    the less than 2-sigma uncertainty on the polarization amplitude means that this can not be considered as a detection of polarized light from the planet . a model with no polarization variation due to",
    "the planet is still an accepteble fit to the data .",
    "however , it is interesting that our best fit polarization amplitude of 29.4 @xmath0 15.6 ppm is at a level that is in agreement with plausible values for rayleigh scattering from the planet .",
    "for example @xcite estimate an amplitude of 26 ppm for a rayleigh - like multiple scattering model with a single scattering albedo of 0.99 .",
    "this is an optimistic model because in reality we would expect a modest reduction in the amplitude due to ( i ) atomic and molecular absorption features and ( ii ) the rayleigh depolarisation factor of 0.02 @xcite which reduces the polarisation at each scattering event .",
    "considering the geometric albedo from a fractional eclipse depth of @xmath7 ppm from 290 - 450 nm reported in @xcite , and the rayleigh scattering model grid of @xcite which would place an upper limit to the amplitude of the polarised light contribution at about 30 per cent of the geometric albedo , we can estimate an upper bound for a rayleigh scattering atmosphere to be @xmath8",
    ".    a more extensive set of observations with an instrument like hippi on a 4-m class telescope might be capable of detecting the expected planetary signal in this and other bright hot jupiter systems .",
    "putting a similar instrument on an 8-m class telescope should enable the measurement uncertainties to be halved from @xmath1 14 ppm to @xmath1 7 ppm , making detection of the expected signals at levels of @xmath1 20 ppm possible .",
    "a clear result of our observations , is that in addition to any polarization from the planet , there is a constant background level of polarization from hd 189733 .",
    "depending on what we assume about the planetary signal , this ranges from around 55 ppm , if we use the values given in section [ sec_results ] for no planetary signal , to 70 ppm for the best fit model of table [ tab_fit ] .",
    "interstellar polarization is the most likely source of polarization in typical solar - like stars @xcite .    extrapolating from the trends in figure 4 in @xcite",
    ", we would expect a star at @xmath9 pc @xcite , in the northern hemisphere and in the galactic plane to have a polarization between 1540 ppm .",
    "this is rather less than the values we find for hd 189733 .",
    "circumstellar dust can also produce a constant offset for the polarized light signal from a system .",
    "however , @xcite found hd  189733 was unlikely to have circumstellar dust substantial enough to affect polarisation measurements based upon measurements of infrared excess .",
    "the effect of circumstellar dust on a system s polarized light measurements would be an addition to the offsets @xmath10 and @xmath11 which would not vary over the timescale of the planet s orbit .",
    "there are other possible sources that could be contributing to polarized light in the system .",
    "hd 189733a is an active by draconis type variable star : a star whose brightness varies due to star spots moving across its surface .",
    "star spots can cause linear polarization by breaking the circular symmetry of the limb polarization @xcite .",
    "however @xcite found that starspots would only cause a maximum of 3 ppm contribution to polarized light based on the photometric transit curve deviations from @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite estimated the contribution of starspots on the polarized light signal to be only @xmath12 .",
    "the interplay between the planet and starspot symmetry breaking can produce detectable effects during the planet s transit .",
    "however none of our observations are taken during transit .",
    "the linearly polarized light from the starspots themselves , is negligible @xcite under most circumstances .",
    "magneto - optical effects such as the transverse zeeman effect @xcite or the faraday effect @xcite could introduce noise to the linear polarisation measuements if enough lines were present within our bandpass or if significant starspot coverage is present along with extended ionised gases from the planet s atmosphere respectively .",
    "the rotational period of hd 189733a is known to be longer , at 11.8 days @xcite , than the orbital period of hd 189733b . with additional observations it should be possible to determine whether the magnitude of activity associated with starspots is significant , and",
    "disentangle it from that due to reflection from clouds in the planetary atmosphere .",
    "regardless , in any analysis focused on the orbital period , starspot effects will average out over time .",
    "the large polarization amplitudes for hd 189733 reported by @xcite are not seen in the other three datasets now reported for this object , @xcite , @xcite and this work .",
    "the strongest evidence for polarization variation found by @xcite was in the _ b _ band turpol data from the nordic optical telescope on la palma obtained on dates of 2008 apr 18 - 24 , and 2008 aug 2 - 9 .",
    "they note that the august data was affected by saharan dust but argue that this should not cause any effect on the results as `` _ _ turpol enables exact compensation of any background polarization that is not variable ... _ _ '' .",
    "this statement misunderstands how airborne dust impacts on precision polarimetry .",
    "it is not a background sky polarization that could be automatically subtracted by the instrument s sky - subtraction capability .",
    "the dust introduces a spurious polarization into starlight passing through the dust .",
    "the effects were studied in detail by @xcite using observations of a saharan dust event observed with planetpol in 2005 .",
    "data from the carlsberg meridian telescope on la palma show a substantial saharan dust event over 2008 aug 2 to 9 with the _ @xmath13 _ band extinction ranging from 0.212 to 0.377 throughout this period ( compared with a normal clear sky level of @xmath10.09 ) .",
    "this is a larger and more extended event than the one observed in 2005 by @xcite which led to spurious polarization effects up to 48 ppm at 56 zenith distance .",
    "it seems highly likely that the hd  189733 data reported by @xcite are significantly affected by this dust . as the individual observations are not reported , it is not possible to judge the extent of the problem .",
    "however , without exclusion or correction of affected data , this can not be regarded as a reliable dataset for precision polarimetry .",
    "we have reported new polarization observations of the hot jupiter exoplanet system hd 189733 .",
    "the observations have higher precision than any previously reported for this object .",
    "we do not detect the large polarization amplitude ( 100 - 200 ppm ) planetary signals previously reported @xcite .",
    "our results agree reasonably well with the results of @xcite showing generally positive polarization values in q / i and u / i , and at most a small planetary polarization signal .",
    "a least - squares fit of a rayleigh - lambert model gives a polarization amplitude of 29.4 @xmath0 15.6 ppm . while this signal has less than 2-sigma significance and",
    "can not be claimed as a detection of planetary polarization , it is at a level consistent with a plausible polarization amplitude from the planet .",
    "it is consistent with a multiply - scattering atmosphere which could produce the albedo measurements taken by @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a more extensive series of observations , or observations on a larger telescope should enable the planetary polarization to be detected and measured .",
    "hd 189733 has a significant constant background level of polarization that is a somewhat higher than would be expected for interstellar polarization .",
    "this could be due to the non - unformity of the local hot bubble interstellar medium .",
    "we suggest that the polarization data of @xcite , which shows a large polarization amplitude inconsistent with that reported by other groups , may be unreliable as a result of spurious polarization due to a saharan dust event over the la palma observatory in august 2008 .",
