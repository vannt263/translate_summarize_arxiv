    "the distribution of the logarithm of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) durations is bimodal ( kouveliotou 1993 ) , with a gap at about 2 seconds : a third of all batse bursts last between 0.01 s and 2 s ( the short grbs ) , while the 25 kev1 mev of the remaining two thirds extended over 2 to 500 s ( the long grbs ) . until several months ago",
    ", space - based observatories have provided arcminute localizations only for long bursts , enabling their optical follow - up and leading to the spectroscopic identification of type ib / c supernovae associated with at least four bursts ( grbs 980425  galama 1998 , 011211 ",
    "garnavich 2003 , 030329 ",
    "stanek 2003 , 031203 ",
    "malesani 2004 ) .",
    "the optical emission of the afterglows of several other long bursts exhibited a plateau at 1030 days after the burst , suggesting a supernova contribution in these cases as well .    in the last half - year ,",
    "the hete - ii and swift missions have localized accurately short grbs at an average rate of one per month : four bursts ( 050509b , 050709 , 050906 , 051105 ) last less than 0.1 s and two other ( 050724 , 050813 ) had a duration of about 1 second .",
    "optical searches for the accompanying afterglow emission have yielded a few pieces of evidence in favour of a compact binary merger ( ns - ns or ns - bh ) origin for these short bursts .",
    "these pieces of evidence are based on our belief that the ultra - relativistic outflows required to produce a grb results from either the merger of two compact objects , one of which is a ns ( lattimer & schramm 1976 , blinnikov 1984 ) or in the collapse of a massive star s core ( woosley 1993 , paczyski 1998 ) . for the former model , the dynamical timescale is of order 10 ms , while for the latter , the gas fall - back time on the bh should last more than a few seconds .",
    "there are other processes which can determine the burst duration ( viscous accretion time of the debris disk , jet penetration through its surroundings , dissipation of outflow s energy ) , still the above timescales naturally lead to the association of short grbs with compact mergers and of long bursts with massive stars .",
    "consequently , any observational evidence that a short grbs is not associated with a massive star : @xmath0 a low star - formation rate for the grb host galaxy ( grb 050509b  bloom 2005 , grb 050724 ",
    "berger 2005 , grb 050813 ",
    "prochaska 2005 ) , @xmath3 a host galaxy with an evolved stellar population ( grb 050724  gorosabel 2005 ) , @xmath8 the lack of a bright / blue star - forming region at the location of the afterglow ( grb 050709  fox 2005 , hjorth 2005 ) , or @xmath9 the lack of an accompanying supernova ( grb 050509b  bloom 2005 , grb 050709 ",
    "fox 2005 ) , are ( indirect ) arguments in favour of the binary merger model .",
    "a direct proof for merging binaries as the progenitors of short grbs would be the systematic lack down to @xmath10 ( below the magnitude of the dimmer hosts of long grbs ) of a galaxy superposed on bursts localized with ( sub-)arcsecond accuracy through their optical and x - ray afterglows , as the natal kick of neutron stars ( @xmath11 ) can be sufficiently large to allow them to escape the host galaxy and travel tens to hundreds of kpcs during their merging times ( @xmath12 gyr ) .",
    "one difficulty here is that the afterglows of short bursts occurring in the intergalactic medium could be too dim to detect and localize accurately , thus there could be an observational bias against those short bursts which escape their hosts .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate another possible test for the origin of short burst in binary mergers , by modelling the multiwavelength emission of the grb afterglows 050709 and 050724 .",
    "afterglow modelling constrains some dynamical parameters of the grb outflow which can be related to the properties of the burst progenitor : @xmath0 circumburst medium density , @xmath3 blast - wave kinetic energy and @xmath8 outflow collimation .",
    "if short bursts do indeed arise from binary mergers then the circumburst density resulting from afterglow fitting should sometimes be characteristic for the intergalactic medium ( of order @xmath13 ) .",
    "however , the inferred circumburst medium density could be characteristic for the interstellar medium ( @xmath14 ) or for a galactic halo ( around @xmath15 ) if the compact binary had short merging time or did not escape from the host .",
    "therefore , in the case of a short - grb afterglow for which a spatially coincident galaxy is not observed , the circumburst density obtained through afterglow modelling will distinguish between a truly escaped binary interacting with the intergalactic medium and a merger occurring within a high - redshift , undetectable host .",
    "if the gravitational binding energy of the torus is the source of the grb outflow kinetic energy then the outflows of short grbs could be 10 times less energetic than that of long bursts because the mass of the torus resulting in a binary merger ( @xmath16  ruffert & janka 1998 ) is a factor 10 lower than that resulting from the collapse of a wr star s core ( @xmath17  fryer & woosley 1998 ) . under the assumptions that the redshifts and efficiencies ( ratio of burst @xmath18-ray output to the outflow kinetic energy ) of the short and long batse bursts are similar , this energy ratio is consistent with that the fluence of short grbs is , on average , 30 times smaller than that of long bursts .",
    "however , as noted by mszros , rees and wijers ( 1999 ) , the relativistic outflows resulting from binary mergers could be more energetic than those produced by collapsars if the magnetic field in the torus threads the bh and tap its spin energy .",
    "the constraints on the opening of short - grb outflows may also provide some insight on the mechanism which collimates grb jets .",
    "if jets are magnetically collimated then the stronger fields expected in compact mergers could produce narrower jets than those resulting from collapsars .",
    "however the opposite is possible if the collimation of binary - merger short - grb jets is due to their interaction with the baryonic wind from the disk ( rosswog & ramirez - ruiz 2003 ) while that of massive - star long - grb jets is caused by their penetration through the core and stellar envelope ( aloy 2000 , macfadyen , woosley & heger 2001 ) .",
    "the afterglow model employed here is that of a relativistic blast - wave decelerated by the sweeping - up of the circumburst medium .",
    "its formalism is that described in panaitescu & kumar ( 2001 ) . in calculating the dynamics of the decelerating grb remnant , we consider that the outflow is uniform , in the sense that the ejecta kinetic energy per solid angle ( @xmath19 ) is the same in any direction .",
    "the scarcity of the available data does not warrant the use of a structure outflow .",
    "radiative losses are taken into account and allowance is made and for a possible outflow collimation and a lateral spread of the jet . when the blast - wave has decelerated sufficiently that the jet edge is seen",
    ", the afterglow light - curve should exhibit an achromatic break ( steepening of the power - law decay ) .",
    "fox ( 2005 ) claimed that the optical light - curve of the grb afterglow 050709 exhibits a break at @xmath20 d , though the post - break decay was not monitored to prove that a jet - break indeed existed . the fast decay of the radio light - curve of the grb afterglow 050724 after 1 day suggests that a jet - break occurred at about @xmath21 d , but the possibility of a strong interstellar scintillation ( grb 050724 occurred at a low galactic latitude ) , the paucity of the radio measurements and the possible passage of the peak frequency of the forward shock continuum through the radio domain at days after the burst prevent a firm identification of the jet - break epoch .",
    "if the jet - break epoch is known , with the aid of the kinetic energy @xmath19 and circumburst density @xmath22 resulting from afterglow modelling , one can constrain the initial jet half - angle @xmath23 . starting from the expression of the shock s lorentz ( @xmath24 ) as a function of observer time ",
    "@xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the outflow s kinetic energy in @xmath27 , @xmath28 the medium density in protons per @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the observer time ( in days ) corresponding to the arrival time of the photons emitted from the fluid moving at an angle @xmath31 relative to the observer s line of sight toward the blast - wave center ",
    "the condition that the jet edge becomes visible at some time @xmath32 ( and that the effects of collimation are manifested ) : @xmath33^{-1}$ ] leads to @xmath34 this implies a the jet energy @xmath35    the electrons of the shocked circumburst medium radiate synchrotron emission and upscatter it .",
    "the emitted flux depends on three free parameters pertaining to the magnetic field energy ( @xmath36 ) , the minimum electron energy ( @xmath37 ) and the power - law index of the electron distribution with energy ( @xmath38 ) in the shocked medium .",
    "all are assumed to be constant . together with the blast - wave energy and the medium density , the @xmath36 and @xmath37 parameters determine the peak flux of the synchrotron continuum ( @xmath39 ) and its breaks : the self - absorption frequency ( @xmath40 ) , the synchrotron characteristic frequency for the minimum energy electrons ( @xmath41 ) and the cooling frequency ( @xmath42 ) at which emit the electrons whose radiative and adiabatic timescales are equal .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 determines the slope @xmath43 of the synchrotron continuum above its peak and the index @xmath44 of the power - law decay of the afterglow flux ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "it follows that the relative intensities of the measured radio , optical and x - ray fluxes and their decays constrain the five afterglow parameters : two ( @xmath19 and @xmath22 ) for the dynamics of the blast - wave and three ( @xmath37 , @xmath36 and @xmath38 ) for the synchrotron radiation .",
    "as can be seen from equation ( [ thjet ] ) , the epoch of the optical light - curve break constrains primarily the initial jet aperture . because the shape and duration of the optical light - curve steepening also depends on",
    "how relativistic is the jet at the break time , a numerical fit to the light - curve steepening also provides constraints on the blast - wave energy and circumburst density .",
    "using this afterglow model , panaitescu ( 2005 ) has found the following parameters for a sample of ten long - grb afterglows whose optical light - curves exhibited a break at @xmath46 d after the burst : @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 erg .",
    "the lack of radio detections and an optical light - curve break for this afterglow prevent us from obtaining tight constraints on its physical parameters . as shown in figure [ nchi2 ] , the best fit @xmath50 as a function of the circumburst medium density has two broad minima for which @xmath5 and @xmath51 .",
    "an example of a fit for each type of density is shown in figure [ 0507 ] .",
    "for the low density solutions , the outflow has a kinetic energy per solid angle @xmath52 , hence the 30400 kev burst output ( @xmath53  fox 2005 ) implies a grb efficiency below 1 percent . from equations ( [ thjet ] ) and ( [ ejet ] ) , the lack of a jet - break until 10 days requires that @xmath54 and @xmath55 erg .",
    "the magnetic field energy ( @xmath36 ) and the minimum electron energy ( @xmath37 ) are found to be larger than @xmath56 and 0.04 of the energy of the post - shock fluid , respectively .",
    "we note that , for such low ambient densities and at the redshift @xmath57 of this burst , the apparent source size is @xmath58 ( with the notation @xmath59 and time measured in days ) .",
    "the grb afterglow 050709 was not detected in the radio down to @xmath60 .",
    "however the radio emission of other small - redshift afterglows interacting with so tenuous media may be bright enough to be detected ( the peak radio flux is above 0.3 mjy for a burst redshift @xmath61 ) , which would provide two tests for a low density circumburst medium .",
    "first , the source size at @xmath62 days could be sufficiently large to measure with the vlba .",
    "second , above 1 ghz , the source is larger than the size of the first fresnel zone for weak scattering by the galactic interstellar medium and larger than the size of the strong scattering disk , consequently the amplitude of radio scintillations should be small .    for the higher density solutions , the resulting outflow kinetic energy density is @xmath63 ,",
    "therefore the grb efficiency is between 5 and 20 percent .",
    "a jet - break after 10 days requires @xmath1 and @xmath64 erg .",
    "the microphysical parameters have values slightly below equipartition .",
    "we note that these afterglow parameters are similar to those found by fox ( 2005 ) .    that the fit microphysical parameters increase with the medium density ( while the outflow energy decreases ) and approach equipartition for @xmath65 shows why a higher external density is not allowed .",
    "put in equivalent form , as the medium density is increased , the cooling frequency falls below the optical , leading to an incompatibility between the model and observational optical  to  x - ray flux ratios : for @xmath66 , the 110 days power - law decay of the optical emission , @xmath67 , implies that the _ intrinsic _ optical spectral energy distribution has a slope @xmath68 larger than the optical  to  x - ray spectral slope , @xmath69 ( calculated from observations at 1.6 d , 2.5 d and 16 days ) , a situation which can not be accommodated by the standard blast - wave scenario .",
    "the x - ray emission of the grb afterglow 050724 exhibits a flare at 0.23 d after the burst ( burrows 2005 ) .",
    "such flares , having a timescale comparable to the epoch when they occur , have been observed for many other bursts .",
    "the x - ray flares with the shortest duration , @xmath70 are unlikely to arise from the afterglow blast - wave , as all plausible mechanisms related to it ( energy injection , hot spots , reverse shock emission ) should produce either longer - lived or weaker flares . instead such short - lived flares may be due to late internal shocks ( zhang 2005 ) occurring in an outflow ejected after that which produced the burst . for this reason , we model first the afterglow 050724 emission without the x - ray flare .",
    "the paucity of optical measurements for this afterglow prevents a tight constraining of its parameters . the medium density which can accommodate the emission of this afterglow is in the @xmath71 range ( figure [ nchi2 ] ) .",
    "the ejecta kinetic energy per solid angle is @xmath72 thus , if the jet - break epoch is @xmath46 d ( as suggested by the steep @xmath73 decay of the radio emission ) , then @xmath74 and @xmath75 erg .",
    "the burst output , @xmath76 ( berger 2005 ) , implies that the grb efficiency is between 10 and 75 percent .",
    "the magnetic and minimum electron energies are both found to be larger than 0.01 of the shocked medium energy .",
    "a fit with such parameters is shown with solid curves in figure [ 0724 ] .",
    "the bounds on the allowed medium density arise from the condition that the magnetic and electron energies do not exceed equipartition .",
    "the equality of the optical spectral slope @xmath77 ( inferred from the @xmath78- , @xmath79- , @xmath80- and @xmath81-band measurements at 0.5 day ) to the optical  to  x - ray spectral slope , @xmath82 ( calculated from the extrapolation of the 0.010.1 day x - ray fluxes at 0.5 day ) , implies that , at 0.5 day , the cooling frequency ( @xmath42 ) is not between the optical and x - ray domains .",
    "consistency between the x - ray decay index ( @xmath83 ) and the spectral slope ( @xmath84 ) reported in gcn 3669 ( p. romano ) , requires that @xmath42 is below the x - rays , hence it must also be below the optical ( @xmath85 hz ) . the rise and fall of the radio emission before and after 2 d , respectively , indicate that the peak frequency of the forward - shock emission crosses the radio domain at that epoch , hence @xmath86 ghz , and that the peak flux is @xmath87 mjy ( constant before the jet - break time @xmath32 ) . from the expressions of the synchrotron continuum characteristics ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath39 ) as functions of the afterglow parameters ( @xmath19 , @xmath22 , @xmath37 , @xmath36 ) ,",
    "the above constraints lead to @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where @xmath40 and @xmath42 are in @xmath92 and @xmath93 hz , respectively .",
    "then , the conditions @xmath94 and @xmath95 lead to @xmath96 ghz ( constant before @xmath32 ) , with a weak dependence on @xmath42 , and to that @xmath22 and @xmath19 are in the above ranges found numerically through afterglow modelling .    given that the x - ray flare of this afterglow is long - lived , it could arise from the forward shock , we have also modelled it with an episode of energy injection in the blast - wave .",
    "such fits ( an example is shown in figure [ 0724 ] with dashed lines ) require a larger energy per solid angle after injection , @xmath97 , and the same medium density range as for the fit without the x - ray flare , hence the jets is slightly narrower , @xmath98 , and the jet energy larger , @xmath99 erg .",
    "the circumburst medium density ( @xmath5 ) of the high - energy solution for the multiwavelength emission of the grb afterglow 050709 is consistent with the hypothesis that this burst arose in a binary merger , as such mergers can occur well outside the host galaxy environment .",
    "its radio emission has not been detected ; a brighter radio afterglow at low - redshift ( @xmath100 ) and occurring in the intergalactic medium could provide two direct tests for the existence of very tenuous media around short grbs : the radio source would be sufficiently large to measure with the vlba and to quench the interstellar scintillation .",
    "however , modelling of the grb afterglow 050709 emission does not provide a definitive argument in favour of the binary merger scenario , as the highest allowed density ( obtained for the low - energy solution discussed in  [ 050709 ] ) , @xmath101 , is comparable with that of the interstellar medium . taking into account that this afterglow is at only 4 kpc ( in projection ) from the center of its host , the higher density solution appears more plausible .    the medium density which accommodates the emission of the grb afterglow 050724 , @xmath102 , is larger than for a galactic halo or the intergalactic medium and consistent with that this afterglow is at 2.5 kpc from the host s center .",
    "this result does not lend support to the binary merger origin for grb 050724 but it does not rule it out either , as it is possible that a low binary velocity combined with a short merging time or a strong host galaxy gravitational potential led to a merger occurring in the intragalactic environment .",
    "the radio measurements of the afterglow 050724 indicate that the jet - break is at about 1 day which , for the medium density and ejecta kinetic energy per solid angle ranges identified through afterglow modelling , requires that the jet is wider than @xmath103 ( half - opening ) .",
    "the optical emission of the afterglow 050709 suggests that the jet - break is at or after 10 days which , for an ejecta kinetic energy per solid angle comparable to that of the afterglow 050724 ( the low - energy / high - density solution discussed in  [ 050709 ] ) , requires a jet half - angle larger than @xmath104 .",
    "compared with the properties of the outflows of long - grb afterglows inferred by panaitescu ( 2005 ) , the jets of the short grbs 050709 and 050724 are at least twice wider , have a kinetic energy per solid angle smaller by a factor of 100 or more and a collimation - corrected kinetic energy which may be smaller by a factor of about 550 .",
    "if confirmed with other future afterglows , the weaker collimation of short - burst outflows will indicate that grb jets are not collimated by magnetic fields but , we should keep in mind that the jet penetration through the he envelope could enhance significantly the collimation of the outflows produced in collapsars .",
    "the smaller kinetic energy of the short - burst outflows would also suggest that grb jets are powered by the gravitational binding energy of the accretion disk and not by the bh spin energy , the disk s magnetic field does not thread the bh .",
    "this suggestion is based on that the expectation that debris disk resulting in ns - ns / bh - ns mergers is 10 times less massive than those of collapsars , while the bh spin energy should be larger in the former model than in the latter .    however , the existence of some underluminous long bursts ( grb 980425  galama 1998 , grb 020903  sakamoto 2004 , 031203  sazonov , lutovinov & sunyaev 2004 ) , whose output was at least 100 times smaller than that of the majority of long bursts casts some doubt on the existence of a dichotomy of the short and long bursts , based on their collimation and energetics .",
    "future observations of short - grb afterglows and a better coverage at radio frequencies and of light - curve jet - breaks , will allow us to extract through afterglow modelling tighter constraints on their jet properties and to make a more robust comparison with those of long bursts .",
    "the same approach will also determine the circumburst density , leading to an independent test for the origin of short bursts in compact binary mergers , provided that these mergers occur in the intergalactic medium .",
