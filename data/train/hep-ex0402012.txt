    "recently the leps collaboration at spring-8 reported the @xmath8 discovery of a new @xmath9 state , the @xmath4 , with a mass of @xmath10 gev@xmath11 and a width of less than 25 mev@xmath11 , close to @xmath12 threshold in the reaction @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the diana collaboration at itep , clas at jefferson lab , and saphir at elsa claimed this narrow state , the candidate for a pentaquark state ( @xmath14 ) , in @xmath15 or @xmath16 decay configurations - all published in 2003 [ 2 - 4 ] .",
    "the work of leps was motivated , in part , by the work by diakonov , petrov and polyakov who studied anti - decuplet baryons using the chiral soliton model @xcite . in their model ,",
    "the anti - decuplet was anchored to the mass of the @xmath17 nucleon resonance , giving the pentaquark state @xmath18 ( spin 1/2 , isospin 0 , and @xmath9 ) a mass of @xmath19 mev@xmath11 and a total width of less than 15 mev@xmath11 . in particular , it is predicted to be an isoscalar .",
    "there are many other theoretical works to try to explain the properties of the @xmath4 with various quark models [ 6 - 9 ] or alternative approaches @xcite",
    ". isospins 0 and 1 are both possible ; isospin 1 would lead to three charge states @xmath20 , @xmath18 , @xmath21",
    ". a reanalysis @xcite of older experimental data on the @xmath22-nucleon elastic scattering put a more stringent constraint on the width to be @xmath23 mev . since the mass of the @xmath24 is larger than the sum of the masses of the nucleon and kaon , it is not easy to understand why its width should be so narrow , unless it has very special quantum numbers",
    ". capstick , page and roberts point out that the @xmath18 could be a member of an isospin quintet with charges from @xmath25 to @xmath26 where the @xmath27 state has a @xmath28 quark - model configuration .",
    "decays of an isotensor @xmath18 into @xmath29 and @xmath30 are isospin violating ; hence an isotensor @xmath18 is expected to be narrow @xcite .",
    "the analyses of clas and saphir support that the @xmath18 is isoscalar , but the statistics of present experiments are limited .",
    "there are experimental questions concerning the @xmath4 .",
    "for the four experiments [ 1 - 4 ] , the exact shape of the background is very difficult to estimate since the @xmath18 is close to @xmath12 threshold , and strong cuts have been applied to the event samples in all cases .",
    "the calculation of dzierba _ et al . _",
    "@xcite shows that kinematic reflections of meson resonances could well account for the enhancement observed in the @xmath31 effective mass distribution at the mass of the purported @xmath18 .",
    "they suggest that further experimental studies will be required with higher statistics , including varying the incident beam momentum and establishing the spin and parity , before claiming solid evidence for a @xmath9 baryon resonance .",
    "it is important to understand the properties of the @xmath24 through systematic studies by different experiments .",
    "compared with the above experiments , the data accumulated at the @xmath32 collision experiment bes are relatively clean and have less background ; therefore it is meaningful to investigate the pentaquark state @xmath24 with the hadronic decays of the charmonium states @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in this work",
    ", we search for the pentaquark state @xmath4 in @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays to @xmath2 and @xmath33 final states using samples of 14 million @xmath0 and 58 million @xmath1 events taken with the upgraded beijing spectrometer ( besii ) located at the beijing electron positron collider ( bepc ) .",
    "these processes could contain @xmath24 decays to @xmath34 and @xmath35 decays to @xmath36 .",
    "besii is a large solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that is described in detail in ref .",
    "charged particle momenta are determined with a resolution of @xmath37 in a 40-layer cylindrical drift chamber .",
    "particle identification is accomplished by specific ionization ( @xmath38 ) measurements in the drift chamber and time - of - flight ( tof ) measurements in a barrel - like array of 48 scintillation counters .",
    "the @xmath38 resolution is @xmath39 ; the tof resolution is @xmath40 ps for bhabha events .",
    "outside of the time - of - flight counters is a 12-radiation - length barrel shower counter ( bsc ) comprised of gas proportional tubes interleaved with lead sheets .",
    "the bsc measures the energies of photons with a resolution of @xmath41 . outside the solenoidal coil , which provides a 0.4 tesla magnetic field over the tracking volume ,",
    "is an iron flux return that is instrumented with three double layers of counters that are used to identify muons .    in this analysis ,",
    "a geant3 based monte carlo simulation package ( simbes ) with detailed consideration of detector performance ( such as dead electronic channels ) is used .",
    "the consistency between data and monte carlo has been checked in many high purity physics channels , and the agreement is quite reasonable .",
    "in @xmath0 or @xmath1 decays to @xmath2 and @xmath33 , the anti - neutron and neutron are not detected .",
    "the first step in the analysis is to select in four prong events the @xmath42 pair , which composes the @xmath43 .",
    "next the missing mass is calculated according to energy - momentum conservation .",
    "the events with missing mass close to the @xmath44 s mass are selected .",
    "we use the same criteria and treatment for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 data .",
    "the first level of event selection requires two positively and two negatively charged tracks with less than ten neutral tracks .",
    "the charged particles are each required to lie within the acceptance of the detector and to have a good helix fit .",
    "the @xmath43 meson in the event is identified through the decay @xmath45 . for the selection of the @xmath43",
    ", both the @xmath46 and @xmath47 are required to be consistent with being pions , namely , @xmath48 .",
    "the definition of @xmath49 is @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are determined from the measured and expected tof times and ionization information for the particle hypothesis of interest . if only tof or @xmath38 information is available , @xmath53 .",
    "the four charged tracks can be grouped into a maximum of four possible @xmath42 combinations .",
    "the combination with the invariant mass closest to the mass of @xmath43 is chosen as the @xmath43 candidate , and the intersection point of the two tracks is regarded as the secondary vertex .",
    "candidate events are required to satisfy @xmath54 mev@xmath11 , where @xmath55 is calculated at the @xmath43 decay vertex . for the proton ( or anti - proton ) and",
    "kaon , we require @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "candidate events are kinematically fitted ( one constraint fit ) under the assumption of a missing @xmath58 to obtain better mass resolution and to suppress the backgrounds . as an example ,",
    "1 shows the @xmath59 distribution of @xmath60 candidate events after particle identification .",
    "we require @xmath61 or @xmath62 and use a further cut on the @xmath43 decay length , @xmath63  3 mm , to remove remaining backgrounds .",
    "= 8.5 cm    fig .",
    "2 shows the @xmath64 missing mass distributions of data and monte carlo for @xmath60 after the above cuts .",
    "the surviving events fall mostly within the range 0.9 - 1.0 gev@xmath11 , and we further require 0.9 gev@xmath11 @xmath65 1.0 gev@xmath11 . the missing mass distributions for the other modes",
    "@xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath3 are similar to those of fig .  2 .",
    "after the above requirements , the individual mass distributions of @xmath60 and @xmath68 are shown in fig . 3 , and the scatter plot of @xmath69 versus @xmath70 for @xmath71 + @xmath3 modes is shown in fig .",
    "no clear @xmath24 signal is observed in fig .",
    "3 , which contains 19 ( @xmath72 ) and 10 ( @xmath73 ) events , or fig .",
    "4 . we determine an upper limit for @xmath74 .",
    "the signal region is shown as a square centered at @xmath75 gev@xmath11 in fig .",
    "zero events fall within the signal region defined as @xmath76 mev from the central value @xcite .",
    "we set an upper limit of 2.30 events in the absence of background at the 90% confidence level ( c.l . ) for @xmath77 and    = 6.05 cm = 5.95 cm    @xmath78 @xmath79 + where 0.686 is the decay ratio of @xmath43 to @xmath42 @xcite ; @xmath80 is the detection efficiency and the uncertainty is statistical error of the monte carlo sample , and @xmath81 is the total number of besii @xmath0 events @xcite .",
    "= 12.5 cm [ cpkp ]    = 7.50 cm    another possibility is that the @xmath0 decays to only one @xmath24 or @xmath35 state . to determine the number of @xmath4 events from single @xmath24 or @xmath35 production , we count the number of events within regions of 1.52 - 1.56 gev@xmath11 , shown by the arrows in fig . 3 and set upper limits on the branching fractions at the 90% c.l .",
