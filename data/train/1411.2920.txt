    "after discovering the higgs particle in lhc@xcite@xcite , one important step is achieved for the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however any hint for the theories which try to explain how to stabilize the quadratic divergencies arising in self interaction of higgs field in sm via quantum fluctuations , as well as shortcomings of sm in grand puzzle of the universe would be the next challenge .",
    "supersymmetry is a theory which introduces an explanation for the strong and electroweak interactions from planck scale down to the weak scale by introducing supersymmetric partners for all the sm particles .",
    "therefore , it reduces the arising quadratic divergences in self interaction of scalar fields to merely logarithmic ones . minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite is a minimal extension of the sm which conceives the supersymmetry . according to the theory ,",
    "if r - parity is conserved among super partners , the lightest supersymmetric particle becomes a typical candidate for weakly - interacting dark matter@xcite .",
    "apparently , the dark matter makes more than one - forth of the energy density of the universe we live in .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle in this context becomes neutralino ( @xmath5 ) and it escapes detection in the detector .",
    "it could only be tracked via missing energies in each event .",
    "there is still ongoing hunt on supersymmetric particles in lhc .    besides of lhc",
    ", there is an ongoing effort for the future international linear collider ( ilc ) by the particle physics community where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 collisions are considered .",
    "it is also possible to design an @xmath6 linear collider to operate as a @xmath9 collider by extracting compton backscattered photons .",
    "@xmath9-collider is considered as a future option in the center of mass energy @xmath10 with an integrated luminosity of the order of @xmath11 yearly @xcite @xcite .",
    "the machine is expected to be upgradeable to @xmath12 with total integrated luminosity up to @xmath13 yearly . in the center of mass system of @xmath9 collision",
    "the energy is peaked around @xmath14 .    the main task in ilc",
    "would be complementing the lhc results , as well as searching clues in beyond the standard model ( bsm ) such as supersymmetry .",
    "the machine will be capable of studying the properties of new particles and the interactions it makes .",
    "linear colliders compared to the lhc , have cleaner background and the signals which exhibits new physics could be more easily resolved from the backgrounds . besides , since the photon coupling is the same for all quarks and leptons , it is the same for new particles from bsm too .",
    "pairs of all species , new and exotic ones will be produced in ilc at similar rates .",
    "consequently , the ilc is an ideal laboratory to study new physics with much more precise measurements . in this paper",
    ", we study the neutralino pair production rates in a photon collider which has been proposed as an option at the ilc .    in the light of physics analyses studies on lhc data in pp collisions at @xmath15 ( lhc7 ) and @xmath16 ( lhc8 ) with @xmath17 and @xmath18 total luminosity respectively , strong limits on susy parameter space and constraints on the mass of the sparticles are set @xcite @xcite @xcite . using the lhc8 and lhc7 data atlas and cms collaborations , recently ,",

    "in addition to that , gauge and anomaly mediated susy breaking models will also be dismissed if the discovered higgs boson with mass of @xmath23 is figured out to be the supersymmetric light cp - even higgs boson .",
    "all these recent results on susy search put pressure to move on from previously defined popular models to new ones which have interesting signatures .    in this study",
    ", the numerical calculation will be presented for the following benchmark points which are proposed in the light of lhc7 and lhc8 data analysis @xcite ; i. ) radiatively driven natural susy ( rns ) , ii . ) msugra / cmssm , iii . ) brummer buchmuller ( bb ) benchmark and iv . ) natural susy ( ns ) , respectively . for these",
    "benchmark points the mass of neutralinos and charginos are at sub - tev range , which makes them accessible at the ilc in @xmath9 collision mode as well . even though , all these benchmark points are outside of the limits presented by lhc8 , therefore , employing these benchmark models for neutralino pair production could show the potential of the ilc concerning the susy searches and possible future optimization for accelerator and detector design .",
    "neutralino pair production rates in @xmath9 collider in the context of supersymmetry , especially , helicity nature of the cross section are studied before by g.j.gounaris et all @xcite , the distribution of the cross section is comparable to our results .",
    "however , the total integrated photonics cross section for the generic feynman diagrams presented by f.zhou et all @xcite are higher than our numerical results at the order of two to three . in this study",
    "we have calculated the neutralino pair production rates including whole set of all possible one - loop level feynman diagrams , the total cross section as a function of center - of - mass ( cms ) energy for the neutralino pairs via unpolarized photon - collisions are presented .",
    "in addition to these , the angular distribution of the cross section is calculated for the unpolarized photon - collisions and evaluation of all these numerical calculations are done for the new benchmark models introduced in @xcite .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the process @xmath24 have been performed using the packages ` feynarts`@xcite to generate the feynman diagrams and corresponding amplitudes , ` formcalc`@xcite to simplify the fermion chains then square the corresponding amplitudes , and ` looptools`@xcite to perform the evaluation of scalar and tensor one - loop integrals . due to the complexity of the diagrams it is not illuminating to give the lengthy expressions of the full amplitude .",
    "instead , we have choose to release the numerical code of the total cross section defined in consequent chapters for the @xmath24 scattering process in terms of susy parameters at the electroweak scale such as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , mixing angles and sparticle mass spectrum .",
    "thus by providing all these parameters it is possible to calculate the total photonic cross section as well as convoluted one with the photon structure function to give the total cross section in @xmath9 collision in @xmath6 colliders .",
    "the content of this paper is organized as follows . in sec-[sec:2 ] , the neutralino sector in mssm is discussed . in sec-[sec:3 ] , analytical expressions regarding the kinematics of the scattering , the total cross section and the convolution of the cross section in @xmath6 machine are given . in sec-[sec:4 ] , numerical results of the total cross section for each benchmark point we chose are discussed . at last",
    "the conclusion is drawn in sec-[sec:5 ] .",
    "according to the mssm lagrangian , the mass eigenstates namely the neutralinos are the linear combination of neutral gauginos ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) and the neutral part of higgsino fields ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) . the relevant part in the lagrangian responsible for neutralino masses",
    "is defined by bilinear fermion field @xmath33 with @xmath34 . @xmath35",
    "the neutralinos are denoted by @xmath36 and the mixing is determined by the neutralino mixing matrix @xmath37    in r - parity conserved msugra model , the mass matrix depends on some sm parameters such as mass of z - boson , the weak angle and four unknown parameters which are gaugino mass parameters @xmath25 associated with the @xmath38 symmetry group , @xmath26 associated with the @xmath39 , supersymmetric higgs mass parameters @xmath27 and the last parameter is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of two higgs fields @xmath40 . therefore , @xmath41 and @xmath42 represents the cos and sin of weak angle respectively , the same is holds true for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the mass parameters in neutralino mass matrix could be complex for cp non - invariant cases , since we ignore the cp violation we took all the parameters as real .",
    "since the neutralino mass matrix @xmath45 is hermitian the eigenvalues are guaranteed to have a real values .",
    "thus , it can be diagonalized by an unitary matrix @xmath46 such that @xmath47    eigenvalues of the diagonal matrix @xmath48 are real but not necessarily positive .",
    "therefore , it is customary to define mass eigenstate fields ( the neutralino masses ) with positive values and increasing mass @xmath49 .",
    "there are analytical procedures to find the unitary matrix @xmath46 , therefore , usually it is calculated numerically .",
    "neutralino mass matrix can be diogonalized by real matrix instead of an unitary one , but sometimes mass values could be negative . in calculation ,",
    "those physical mass states which corresponds to negative mass values need to be modified by chiral rotation . instead of modifying the negative mass corresponding mass states , we used the singular value decomposition method @xcite@xcite to compute the unitary matrix , in a result all the mass eigenvalues are positive . hereafter ,",
    "if we rotate the gauge eigenstates ( @xmath50 ) to the physical mass eigenstate basis by the unitary matrix @xmath51 then lagrangian could be written in terms of diagonal physical mass basis . @xmath52",
    "in this section , analytical expressions of photonic cross section and convoluted cross section with the photon luminosity in @xmath6 collider for neutralino pair production are given . throughout this paper ,",
    "the process for the neutralino pair production at nlo via photon - photon collision is denoted as @xmath53 where @xmath54 @xmath55 are the four momenta of the incoming photons and outgoing neutralinos respectively , whereas @xmath27 and @xmath56 represents the polarization vectors of incoming photons .",
    "since photon does nt have coupling to itself , neutralino pair production via photon - photon collision is only possible at the lowest one - loop level .",
    "all the relevant feynman diagrams contributing to the subprocess @xmath57 at the one - loop level are depicted in fig-[fig : neupair_box]-[fig : neupair_quart ] , they are generated using ` feynarts ` .",

    "the particles in loops of the quartic coupling diagrams are running in each direction , as usual .    in calculation we take in to account all the possible one loop level diagrams , therefore , it is not necessary to take in to account the renormalization because ultraviolet divergence is cancelled automatically . in this",
    "study the calculation is performed in the _ t hooft - feynman _ gauge where the gauge boson propagators are in simple form so the computations are simplest .    the corresponding lorentz invariant matrix element for the one - loop level process is written as a sum over box - dagrams ( fig-[fig : neupair_box ] ) , triangle - diagrams ( fig-[fig : neupair_tri ] ) and quartic ones depicted in fig-[fig : neupair_quart ] , @xmath61 where due to the fermi statistics in the calculation of the amplitudes there is relative @xmath62 sign between the diagrams obtained by exchanging the neutralinos at the final state in fig-[fig : neupair_box ] , [ fig : neupair_tri ] and [ fig : neupair_quart ] .    in numerical calculation , the scattering amplitude is evaluated in the center of mass frame , denoting the four - momentum and scattering angle by ( @xmath63 ) , the energy @xmath64 and momentum @xmath65 of the incoming and outgoing particles are given below in terms of cms energy @xmath66 of incoming photons and neutralino masses @xmath67 : @xmath68    sum over the polarization vectors of the incoming photons are calculated using the following vectors : @xmath69    after summing over the helicities of the neutralinos and the polarization vectors of the incoming photons , the cross section of the unpolarized photon collisions is calculated by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is simply the kllen function for the phase space of outgoing neutralino pairs , the factors @xmath72 and @xmath73 are respectively due to the identical - particle at the final state and helicity average of the neutralinos , lastly , @xmath74 and @xmath75 runs over the neutralino flavors at the final state .",
    "the pair production of neutralinos via photon - photon collision is possible by using the laser back - scattering technique on electron beam in @xmath6 at ilc .",
    "the big fraction of the cms energy of the electron beam could be transferred to the photon collision .",
    "then @xmath76 process could be taken as a subprocess in @xmath6 collisions .",

    ", neutralino pair production is calculated for the benchmark models specifically introduced for the ilc by the constraints set from lhc7 and lhc8 .",
    "a very important feature of supersymmetry is that all three gauge couplings defined in sm meet at one point - this unification is also predicted by guts and string theories - which is one of the reason why supersymmetry attracted so much attention .",
    "besides , susy at the weak scale also gives a solution to the so called hierarchy problem .",
    "to reconcile supersymmetry with the experimental results the supersymmetry is broken slightly so that the sparticles have heavier mass spectrum .",

    "<S> neutralino pair production via photon - photon collisions is analyzed in the context of minimal supersymmetric standard model at future linear collider . </S>",
    "<S> since photon does not have self coupling , this process is only possible at next - to - leading order and all the possible terms are calculated for the photon - photon interaction , including box , triangles and quartic coupling diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> numerical analysis of the production rates for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are presented for four new distinct benchmark models which are presented in the light of lhc8 . </S>",
