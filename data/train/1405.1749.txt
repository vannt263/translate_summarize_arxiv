    "in this work we study the long term behavior of continuous time markov processes whose states assign either @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( usually called a spin value ) to each vertex @xmath5 in a graph @xmath2 .",
    "the graphs @xmath2 we consider are related to homogeneous trees of degree @xmath6 and include infinite stacks of homogeneous trees .",
    "these graphs will be specified in section [ sec : themodel ] , where we will also discuss some earlier papers where such stacks of trees have been studied .",
    "the geometric and percolation theoretic methods we introduce to carry out our analysis ( see especially section  [ sec : main ] and appendix  [ app : geometric ] ) are potentially of independent interest .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 the value of the spin at vertex @xmath8 at time @xmath9 .",
    "starting from a random initial configuration @xmath10 drawn from the independent bernoulli product measure    @xmath11    the system then evolves in continuous time according to an agreement inducing dynamics : at rate 1 , each vertex changes its value if it disagrees with more than half of its neighbors , and tosses a fair coin in the event of a tie .",
    "our arguments and results easily extend to many other types of dynamics , as discussed in remark  [ remark1.3 ] below ; these include processes in discrete time , as in  @xcite , and different rules for tie - breaking .",
    "our process corresponds to the zero - temperature limit of glauber dynamics for a stochastic ising model with ferromagnetic nearest neighbor interactions and no external magnetic field ( see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "this process has been studied extensively in the physical and mathematical literature  primarily on graphs such as the hyper - lattice @xmath12 and the homogeneous tree of degree @xmath6 , @xmath13 .",
    "a physical motivation is the behavior of a magnetic system following the extreme case of a deep quench , i.e. , when a system has reached equilibrium at infinite temperature and is instantaneously reduced to zero temperature . for references on this and related problems",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the main focus in the study of this model is the formation and evolution of boundaries delimiting same spin cluster domains : these domains shrink or grow or split or coalesce as their boundaries evolve .",
    "an interesting question is whether the system has a limiting configuration , or equivalently does every vertex eventually stop flipping ? whether    @xmath14    exists for almost every initial configuration , realization of the dynamics and for all @xmath15 in the underlying graph depends on @xmath4 and on the structure of the underlying graph  @xmath2 .",
    "nanda , newman and stein @xcite investigated this question when @xmath16 and @xmath17 and found that in this case the limit does not exist , i.e. , every vertex flips forever .",
    "their work extended an old result of arratia  @xcite , who showed the same on @xmath18 for @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "one important consequence of the methods of @xcite is that @xmath21 does exist for almost every initial configuration , realization of the dynamics and every @xmath15 if the graph is such that every vertex has an odd number of neighbors , such as for example @xmath22 for @xmath6 odd .",
    "another question of interest is whether sufficient bias in the initial configuration leads the system to reach consensus in the limit .",
    "i.e. , does there exist @xmath23 , such that for @xmath24 ,    @xmath25    we will refer to as * fixation to consensus * ( of @xmath0 ) .",
    "kanoria and montanari  @xcite studied fixation to consensus on homogeneous trees of degree @xmath26 for a process with synchronous time dynamics .",
    "their process has the same update rules as ours , except that all vertices update simultaneously and at integer times @xmath27 . for each @xmath6 , kanoria and montanari",
    "defined the consensus threshold @xmath28 to be the smallest bias in @xmath29 such that the dynamics converges to the all @xmath0 configuration , and proved upper and lower bounds for @xmath30 as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "fixation to consensus was also investigated on @xmath12 for the asynchronous dynamics model .",
    "it was conjectured by liggett @xcite that fixation to consensus holds there for all @xmath31 .",
    "fontes , schonmann and sidoravicius  @xcite proved consensus for all @xmath32 with @xmath33 strictly less than but very close to 1 and morris  @xcite proved that @xmath34 as @xmath35",
    ".    in @xcite howard investigated the asynchronous dynamics in detail on @xmath36 and showed how fixation takes place . on this tree graph , vertices fixate in spin chains ( defined as doubly infinite paths of vertices of the same spin sign ) .",
    "though no spin chains are present at time 0 when @xmath37 , howard showed that for any @xmath38 , there are ( almost surely ) infinitely many distinct @xmath0 and @xmath1 spin chains at time @xmath39 .",
    "he also showed the existence of a phase transition in @xmath4 : there exists a critical @xmath40 such that if @xmath41 , @xmath0 spin chains do not form almost surely , whereas if @xmath42 they almost surely form in finite time .",
    "our work is motivated by that of howard , but for more general tree - related  graphs .",
    "let @xmath43 denote a doubly infinite stack of homogeneous trees of degree @xmath44 , i.e. , the graph with vertex set @xmath45 and edge set specified below .",
    "the main focus of this paper is proving fixation to consensus on @xmath43 for the process started with an independent identically distributed initial configuration of parameter @xmath4 .",
    "such infinite stacks of trees have been studied before in the context of bernoulli percolation @xcite and ising models @xcite .",
    "more general nonamenable graphs have also been studied  see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "one motivation for these studies is that as the parameter of the model varies , the behavior is sometimes like that on a simple homogeneous tree and sometimes like that on a simple amenable graph like @xmath46 .",
    "we express @xmath47 as    @xmath48    where @xmath49 , and think of this as a decomposition of the infinite stack @xmath43 into layers @xmath50 .",

    "we will denote the arrival times of these poisson processes by @xmath62 and take the poisson processes associated to different vertices to be mutually independent .",
