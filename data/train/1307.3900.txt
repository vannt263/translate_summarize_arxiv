    "wavepackets are a powerful tool for the microlocal analysis of ( fourier integral ) operators and their wave front sets  @xcite . a `` second dyadic decomposition ''  @xcite with parabolic scaling and rotations endows them with the necessary directional sensitivity to resolve singularities .",
    "related objects , such as curvelets and shearlets , incorporate similar features , in particular the parabolic dilations .",
    "frames of these also facilitate methods to sparsify fourier integral operators and resolve the wavefront set ; the emphasis is often on the applications to image processing and numerical aspects .",
    "see  @xcite for representative references .",
    "we consider wavepackets produced by parabolic dilation , rotation and translation of a function @xmath0 , given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a lattice . if @xmath4 is rapidly decaying , the packet @xmath5 is localized near @xmath6 and aligned to an angle of @xmath7 radians . for the coarse scales we use",
    "translates of a second window @xmath8 , which typically is a symmetric gaussian centered at 0 .",
    "the complete collection of such wavepackets is then the set @xmath9 our contribution is twofold : first we consider exact expansions and approximate expansions of @xmath10 functions in terms of these packets using gaussian windows .",
    "second we study the wavefront set with respect to a frame of wavepackets .",
    "the motivation for using purely gaussian windows comes from highly efficient numerical algorithms @xcite , with applications in reflection and global seismology .",
    "the gaussian is the window of choice , because it has the best localization in phase - space and yields the best resolution .",
    "the use of wavepackets that consist of pure gaussians has several technical advantages because a number of computations can be done explicitly .",
    "applications include data compression , denoising , and wavefield recovery from finite data @xcite , and wave propagation and inverse scattering described by fourier integral operators associated with canonical graphs .",
    "for the latter application , see @xcite .",
    "purely gaussian wave packets are effective in the parametrix construction of the wave equation . here",
    "the the initial data are decomposed with respect to a frame of such wave packets , because a gaussian wave packet naturally matches the initial conditions for a multi - scale gaussian - beam - like solution @xcite .",
    "gaussian beams are designed to account for the formation of caustics .",
    "the frame property facilitates the derivation of error estimates for the parametrix which decay under scale refinement .",
    "one can also generate multi - scale gaussian - beam - like solutions from the decomposition of boundary values , which play a role in the development of inverse scattering algorithms via wavefield cross correlation that are based on efficient reverse - time continuation @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a comparison of curvelets and gaussian wavepackets and  @xcite for the use of gaussians as wavelets for the continuous wavelet transform . whereas the recent results on curvelets and shearlets emphasize the construction of tight frames with compactly supported windows or bandlimited windows  @xcite , we understand much less about the spanning properties and the frame properties of wavepackets with gaussian windows . for instance ,",
    "andersson , carlsson , and tenorio   @xcite treat the effective _ approximation _ of bounded compactly - supported functions by this kind of packets , but they left open the question whether a full expansion by a set @xmath11 of gaussian wavepackets represents every function in @xmath10 .",
    "likewise , most of the work on gaussian beams  @xcite emphasizes the algorithmic aspects and contents itself with good numerical approximations .",
    "the question of _ exact _",
    "representations by a wavepacket expansion is omitted .",
    "our work complements the numerical results in @xcite .",
    "we will show in theorem  [ th_crit ] that the wavepacket system @xmath12 constitutes a frame for a large class of gaussian - like windows and suitable lattices @xmath13 .    using a gaussian window",
    "adds numerous ( technical ) difficulties to the rigorous analysis of wavepacket expansions . on the one hand , the gaussian does not have vanishing moments , which is an absolute must in this analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "the gaussian is neither compactly supported nor bandlimited ; this requires delicate estimates to control the overlap of dilates and rotations of the gaussian ( see proposition  [ prop_scale_correlation ] ) .    the problems due to the lack of vanishing moments can be circumvented , as with morlet s wavelets , by considering linear combinations of modulated gaussians . as a fundamental example we consider windows of the form , @xmath14 where the points @xmath15 , the dilation parameters @xmath16 and the coefficients @xmath17 are chosen so that @xmath18 for such a choice of @xmath4 , the wavepackets in are finite linear combinations of gaussians with different eccentricities , scales and centers .",
    "it should be noted that this is different from other gaussian wavepackets that enforce the vanishing moments through a scale - dependent frequency cut - off ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the formula in allows for a number of rather different windows .",
    "one possibility is to let @xmath19 be essentially a translated gaussian @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "this window is then corrected with other gaussians centered near the origin , so as to obtain several vanishing moments .",
    "if @xmath21 , the coefficients corresponding to these correcting terms can be numerically neglected .",
    "the case where @xmath22 is not large enough to make the correcting terms negligible is also of practical interest . in this case",
    "the window @xmath4 does not look like a pure gaussian ( see figure [ fig_win ] ) . nevertheless , an expansion in terms of the packets in leads to an expansion in terms of gaussians .     with vanishing moments of order 3 .",
    "on the left , a plot of @xmath23 , and on the right a plot of its restriction to the @xmath24 axis . @xmath25 [ fig_win ] ]     with vanishing moments of order 3 . on the left , a plot of @xmath23 , and on the right a plot of its restriction to the @xmath24 axis . @xmath25 [ fig_win ] ]    throughout the article we make the following assumptions on the windows @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 the assumption in means that the windows are wide enough so as to cover the whole frequency plane ( see figure [ fig_wsum ] ) .",
    "the gaussian wavepackets in clearly satisfy the decay conditions in and while the vanishing moments in the direction @xmath24 are granted by .",
    "our main result shows that @xmath11 is a frame for @xmath28 for sufficiently fine lattices @xmath29 .",
    "in theorem  [ th_frame ] we give asymptotics on the lattice parameters required for these packets to generate a frame .",
    "the proof uses the method that was developed by daubechies for wavelets  @xcite .",
    "we will examine the quantities that appear in ( the analogue of ) daubechies criterion for wavelets , and then bound the correlation between rotations and dilations of the window .",
    "a similar approach ( involving fewer technicalities ) was recently carried out in @xcite for the so - called cone - adapted shearlets , in order to obtain compactly supported atoms .",
    "the fact that daubechies criterion can be satisfied at all proves that every @xmath10 function can be expanded in terms of pure gaussian packets .",
    "thus our main result provides theoretical support for the accuracy of numerical wavepacket methods in  @xcite .    as a by - product of using daubechies criterion",
    ", we obtain a simple approximate dual frame of the wavepacket system @xmath11 .",
    "the main term of the associated frame operator can be written as a fourier multiplier . applying the inverse of this fourier multiplier to the wavepackets we obtain an approximate dual frame that can be easily computed with a simple frequency filter .",
    "the error estimate given in theorem  [ th_dual ] may be used to justify when to use the simple approximate expansion ( without knowledge of a precise dual frame ) . in the applications to geophysics that motivated us , the data are noisy and possess a limited numerical accuracy @xcite .",
    "therefore , the explicit , simple , but only approximate expansion of the wavefield will be sufficient for many purposes in this context .",
    "our second contribution is the investigation of the wavefront set with gaussian wavepackets .",
    "we will study the behavior of the coefficients @xmath30 as @xmath31 .",
    "since @xmath11 is parametrized by a discrete set and is not invariant under translations and rotations , we need to select the parameters @xmath32 as a function of the scale in order to track a given phase - space point .",
    "thus the discrete description is more subtle than the descriptions with a continuous transform in  @xcite . in theorem  [ th_decay_wave",
    "] we will show that if a point does not belong to the wavefront set of @xmath33 with respect to a sobolev space @xmath34 , then the corresponding coefficients decay like @xmath35 .",
    "we also consider the approximate wavepacket expansion of section 3.4 and show that the coefficients decay fast in the scale parameter @xmath36 , away from the wavefront set of the _",
    "original data_. it is worth pointing out that wavefront sets can be characterized with other types of anisotropies besides the parabolic one , see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.29 ) .",
    "the parabolic scaling , however , is essential for the efficient representation of functions with singularities along smooth curves .     from fig .",
    "[ fig_win ] and @xmath37 , showing @xmath38 and @xmath39 . ]",
    "( absolute value ) . ]",
    "the gaussian wavepackets that we treat in this article share the geometric features of other parabolic wavepackets including curvelets and shearlets .",
    "specifically , the atoms are concentrated on elongated regions obeying the relation : _ width _",
    "@xmath40 _ _ length__@xmath41 and oscillate across their ridge .",
    "the packets in are produced exactly by applying a parabolic dilation , rotation and translation to a single window function . in constrast , the classic gaussian wavepackets from @xcite use an additional frequency cut - off to enforce vanishing moments .",
    "the curvelets from @xcite are produced by parabolic dilation and rotation of a slightly different window at each scale . in the case of shearlets ,",
    "rotations are replaced by the shear maps @xmath42 .",
    "wave packets based on tilings of frequency space are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "while the differences between the various parabolic wavepackets are very relevant in practice , their asymptotic properties are similar .",
    "the gaussian wavepackets in are an example of _ curvelet molecules _ from @xcite and therefore they provide the same sparse approximation properties as curvelets for functions with discontinuities along smooth edges @xcite .",
    "the notion of curvelet molecules and the related notion of _ shearlet molecules _ in @xcite are in turn particular cases of the notion of _ parabolic molecules _ , as recently introduced in @xcite . in that article",
    "it is shown that all expansions with adequate systems of parabolic molecules share similar asymptotic properties .",
    "as a consequence , our results on the decay of frame coefficients away from the wavefront set can be transferred to other parabolic systems .",
    "closest to our work is the construction of curvelet - type expansions in @xcite .",
    "whereas we construct frames by using an analogue of daubechies criterion for wavelets , the curvelet - type frames for @xmath10 in @xcite are obtained by using a perturbation argument .",
    "the main focus of that work is the production of compactly - supported atoms , but the results also apply to sums of modulated gaussians . as mentioned in (",
    "* section 6 ) , the perturbation argument yields a frame where each element is a linear combination of dilated , rotated and translated gaussians .",
    "however , the coefficients in that linear combination depend on the indices of the particular frame element , but the number of terms is proved to be uniformly bounded . by contrast , the packets in consist exactly of parabolic dilations , rotations and translations of a _ single _ function , which may be taken to be a fixed linear combination of gaussians .",
    "the gaussian wavepackets with parabolic scaling in provide an optimal representation of functions with singularities along smooth curves @xcite , sparsify fourier wave propagators @xcite , and are particularly useful in geophysics @xcite .",
    "for other kinds of applications , other geometries are more adequate .",
    "for example , in @xcite it is shown that a dictionary of wave - atoms with the scaling `` _ _ wavelength _ _",
    "@xmath40 _ _ diameter__@xmath41 '' is optimal for the representation of oscillatory patterns ( texture ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we derive certain estimates on rotation - dilation overlaps .",
    "this is perhaps the main technical contribution when working with gaussian wavepackets . in section",
    "3 we develop a daubechies - like frame criterion and derive conditions for when the wavepacket system @xmath11 is a frame .",
    "we also study the approximate expansions . in section  4",
    "we study the complement of the wavefront set and describe it by the decay of the coefficients @xmath30 as @xmath31 .",
    "finally we show that similar estimates hold for the coefficients in the approximate expansion related to daubechies criterion .",
    "* notation : * in the sequel we use the following notation .",
    "we let @xmath43 denote the characteristic function of a set @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the euclidean norm of a vector @xmath46 .",
    "the fourier transform is normalized as @xmath47 .",
    "translations and dilations of function @xmath48 are defined as @xmath49 with this notation , @xmath50 .",
    "note also that with this notation @xmath51 .    let us further denote the parabolic dilations and the rotations by @xmath52 hence @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
