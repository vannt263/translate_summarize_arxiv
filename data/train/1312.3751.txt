    "the joint formation and evolution of galaxies and active galactic nuclei / quasars ( agns / qsos ) is still a major problem in astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "one of the key points has been the discovery , via stellar / gas dynamics and photometric observations , that local elliptical - type galaxies ( etgs ) and massive bulges exhibit at their centers a massive dark object ( mdo ) endowed with a mass @xmath5 proportional to the mass in _ old _ stars or to the @xmath6-band luminosity ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; gebhardt et al . 2000a ; marconi & hunt 2003 ; hring & rix 2004 ; mclure & dunlop 2004 ; ferrarese & ford 2005 ; graham 2007 ; sani et al . 2011",
    "; beifiori et al . 2012 ; mcconnell & ma 2013 ; kormendy & ho 2013 ) .    indeed , the hypothesis that mdos are the black hole ( bh ) remnants of a past qso activity was one of the major motivation for their searches , following the suggestion that qsos are powered by gas accretion onto supermassive bhs ( salpeter 1964 ; zeldovich & novikov 1964 ) and the integral argument presented by soltan ( 1982 ) .",
    "salucci et al .",
    "( 1999 ) demonstrated that the mass function of mdos in local etgs and bulges , derived on the basis of the local @xmath7 correlation , is very close to the mass function of the accreted matter estimated by exploiting the redshift - dependent agn / qso luminosity function , if the paradigm of accretion disc onto a bh ( with reasonable matter - radiation conversion efficiency and limiting luminosity ) is assumed .",
    "moreover , from the analysis of the orbits for a number of individual stars in the central region of our galaxy the presence of a supermassive bh with mass @xmath8 has been established at a very high confidence level ( genzel et al .",
    "once mdos are identified as bhs , the @xmath7 relation translates into a relationship between the bh mass @xmath9 and the stellar mass @xmath10 , suggesting that the star formation on large ( i.e. , kpc ) scale in ( proto-)etgs and the accretion onto the bhs on much smaller ( sub - pc ) scale must in a way talk to each other ( e.g. , alexander & hickox 2012 ) .",
    "the luminosity / mass of the stellar component is not the only global property of the local etgs that correlates with the central bh mass .",
    "in fact , the relation between the mass of the central bh and the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath11 or , more recently , the velocity dispersion of the globular cluster system , has been studied and it appears to be somewhat less dispersed than that with the stellar luminosity / mass ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al . 2000b ; tremaine et al .",

    "this relationship is possibly imprinted by the qso feedback ( but also stellar feedback can contribute ) ; such an idea has been proposed by silk & rees ( 1998 ) based on an energy argument and by fabian ( 1999 ) based on a momentum one , and further developed by king ( 2003 , 2005 ) and by murray et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "also correlations between the central bh mass and the light profiles of the host galaxies have been explored ( graham et al . 2001 ; lauer et al .",
    "2007 ; graham & driver 2007 ; kormendy & bender 2009 ) ; these mirror the complexity of the phenomena related to the coupled evolution of the host galaxy and its central active nucleus .",
    "comprehensive discussions of the subject have been presented by beifiori et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and kormendy & ho ( 2013 ) .    the high degree of correlation ,",
    "though with significant dispersion , between the local values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , or of @xmath9 and @xmath11 , strongly suggests that the star formation on galactic scales , the accreted mass onto the central bh and the ensuing radiated power from the agn have to be in a way coordinated .",
    "however , this is a reductive conclusion , since star formation , gas accretion and radiative feedback are quite complex physical processes occurring on very different spatial and temporal scales . each of these phenomena is _ per se _ a challenging problem to treat .    while some hints on the bh / galaxy coevolution can be derived by focusing onto their low-@xmath12 properties ( e.g. , kormendy & ho 2013 ) , in this paper we aim at showing that the wide samples of agns and host galaxies observed at high redshift ( @xmath0 ) already yield important information on how and when the formation of the oldest stellar population in etgs / bulges and the bh growth influence each other . as a matter of fact , both the nuclear activity ( granato et al . 2001 ; richards et al .",
    "2006 ; driver et al . 2013 ; kulier et al . 2013 ) and the formation of the old stellar populations in etgs peak at @xmath13 ( e.g. , fardal et al . 2007 ; driver et al . 2013 ) .",
    "we leave aside the second stage of star formation in galactic _ thin _ discs ( see cook et al .",
    "2009 ; driver et al .",
    "2013 ) as well as the low redshift fading activity of agns , since there is practically no correlation between the disc luminosity / mass and the bh mass ( e.g. , kormendy & bender 2013 ; kormendy & ho 2013 ) .",
    "correspondingly , low redshift agns exhibit in general small eddington ratios ( e.g. , vestergaard 2004 ; vestergaard & osmer 2009 ; kelly & shen 2013 ) , with the possible exception of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "a likely interpretation of this fading agn phase is that it is mainly due to short episodes of accretion onto a pre - existing supermassive bh ( cavaliere & vittorini 2000 ; ballo et al .",
    "2007 ; simmons et al . 2011 ; shankar 2009 ; shankar et al . 2013 ) .    from a statistical point of view",

    ", it is apparent that for obscured x - ray qsos the observed ratios @xmath161 correspond to an interval in time @xmath209 before the agn decline phase sets in ( see cyan box ) . since during this epoch both the reservoir and the ism are rich in gas and dust , x - ray obscured qsos are also obscured in the uv - optical bands and , as a consequence , are on the average extremely ` red ' ( e.g. , fiore et al . 2009 ) .",
    "after the onset of the qso winds the sfr rapidly decreases and , as mentioned above , the covering factor of the reservoir also decreases . in fact , the population of x - ray unobscured qsos exhibit @xmath210 ( e.g. , page et al .",

    "if the optically bright qsos on average appear at a time @xmath230 when @xmath216 ( only a handful of observed qsos exceed this limit ) , the subsequent evolution of the ratio predicted by the model is @xmath231 the time lapse between the larger ratio @xmath232 and the ratio @xmath233 obtained by stacking non - detections amounts to @xmath234 .",

    "although the above estimates are somewhat uncertain since the statistics depend on the fir detection threshold , nevertheless they highlight the potential of refined data on the ratio @xmath161 to trace this phase of the bright qso evolution .",

    "( 2011 ) find that the fraction of detections decreases to @xmath247 when lower luminosity qsos ( @xmath248 erg s@xmath17 ) are included in the target sample . in our framework",
    "two effects cooperate to get such results .",
    "first , at a given final bh mass , the decrease of the nuclear luminosity corresponds to a faster decrease of the sfr .",
    "secondly , less luminous qsos are on the average associated with less massive bhs and less massive halos and , as a consequence , with host galaxies exhibiting lower sfrs ( see fig .",
    "16 ) .    in fig .",
    "17 we show how the fir detection fraction of optically selected qsos depends on the model parameters . in particular , we illustrate how it changes when varying the timescales of the agn ( top left ) and the sfr decline ( top right ) , the bolometric correction ( bottom left ) , and the fir detection threshold ( bottom right ) .",
    "the same comments to fig .",
    "12 hold , so we do not repeat them here .",
    "the observational data and the model suggest that the x - ray absorbed qsos and the optically selected qsos are representative of two adjacent and subsequent phases , encompassing the time when the agn luminosity overcomes the fir luminosity of the host , while the qso winds remove the ism and reshape the reservoir around the bh ( see fig .",
    "15 ) . the handful of optically selected qsos with @xmath249 can be understood as peculiar objects , wherein the obscuration usually associated with large fir to agn luminosity ratio does not preclude them to be selected in optical surveys .",
    "for instance , the qso j0129 - 0035 at @xmath250 is the faintest one found in the sdss and exhibits @xmath251 ( wang et al .",
    "it also features a quite weak ly@xmath252 line emission ( jiang et al .",
    "2009 ) , as expected for a partially obscured object .",
    "on the other hand , we recall that when @xmath210 the agn feedback is fully removing the cold gas and stopping any flow toward the reservoir / torus , which shrinks down in mass and size .",
    "therefore , during this epoch the optical and x - ray emissions are on the average less obscured ( see   5 ) .",
    "thus the selected objects appear as unobscured agns , exhibiting the well known correlation between uv / optical and x - ray emission ( e.g. , lusso et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in our framework ,",
    "luminous objects evolve along the following sequence : at first they are galaxies violently forming stars and growing up a supermassive bh in their centers .",
    "the bh manifests its mass accretion in hard x ",
    "rays because the obscuration for these energetic photons is less dramatic .",
    "then the qso winds clear up the ism and an optical bright phase follows till the exhaustion of the fuel in the reservoir ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "the sequence looks similar to that suggested by sanders et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , although in our model major mergers are not the leading phenomenon .",
    "it is quite remarkable that even at high redshift the stage of strong star formation in a qso precursor has been already detected .",
    "this is the case of hfsl3 at @xmath253 ( riechers et al .",
    "its gas mass @xmath254 , about @xmath255 of the dynamical mass , is distributed within a radius @xmath256 kpc and its properties are consistent with our scheme .",
    "such system is predicted to evolve into a qso like sdssj114816.64 + 525150.3 at @xmath257 within a few @xmath4-folding times . as a matter of fact , in the latter object walter et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have detected a huge star formation rate @xmath258 yr@xmath17 within a radius @xmath259 kpc .",
    "we notice that sdssj114816.64 + 525150.3 has a ratio @xmath260 , as expected in our framework ( see fig .",
    "an additional interesting aspect is that the fir selected galaxies exhibit larger abundance of low excitation gas with respect to the qsos ( e.g. , riechers et al .",
    "2011 ) , again possibly marking a step in the evolution .",
    "from the above discussion we expect that the luminous optically selected qsos are detectable for @xmath261 @xmath4-folding times around the maximum of their light curve . this visibility time is properly included in the computations of the optical luminosity functions at various redshifts .",
    "the results reported in fig .",
    "18 show a quite good agreement with the observations at high redshifts .",
    "an additional prediction of our overall picture is that the mass in stars and in the bh are already settled to their final value in optically selected qsos , since both star formation and bh accretion are exponentially declining during the optical bright phase .",
    "a discussion of this issue is deferred to   5.1 . in conclusion , though the agn light curve around and after the peak of the activity is modeled in order to fit the behavior of x - ray selected agns , it nicely describes also the statistics of optically selected qsos .",
    "there are additional observations , concerning the evolution of the bh to stellar mass ratio , the obscured to unobscured agn fraction and the qso outflows that are less systematic because of their inherent difficulty , but still provide useful constraints . in the following",
    "we discuss how the model confronts with these observations .      as recalled in   1 , the mass in the old stellar population correlates with the mass of the central bh in local etgs . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been claimed by many authors that the relationship changes with cosmic time .",
    "while individual bh and stellar mass estimates for high redshift agns / qsos must be taken with caution , the data are nevertheless rather informative .",
    "the first relevant piece of evidence is that the _ optically _ selected qsos at @xmath262 exhibit on the average an @xmath263 mass ratio @xmath264 times higher than the local value , @xmath131 , ( e.g. , mclure & dunlop 2004 ; peng et al .",

    "the values predicted by the model for optically selected qsos is @xmath268 , in good agreement with the observational data .",
    "note that the model ascribes the large scatter in @xmath267 mainly to a scatter in @xmath111 , i.e. , to variations in the amount of mass that is first accumulated in the reservoir and then accreted onto the bh .",
    "in addition , it is also possible that the average value of @xmath111 may be itself a function of halo mass and redshift ( see eq .",
    "the model predicts that optically selected qsos have already assembled most of their final stellar and bh masses .",
    "this does not exclude that some mass is subsequently added , but the later evolution must have a minor impact on the average .",
    "the complementary view of the bh and stellar mass evolution is given by ( sub-)mm selected galaxies with detectable agn activity .",

    "( 2011 ) strongly suggest that in these galaxies the ratio @xmath269 applies .",
    "this is consistent with the view that in ( sub-)mm selected galaxies the bh mass is still piling up .",
    "the almost constant sfr coupled with the exponential increase of the bh accretion rate makes this ratio increasing almost exponentially before the declining phase .",
    "we stress that during this self - regulated regime of the bh growth , the ratio @xmath267 does not depend on the amount of matter stored in the reservoir , i.e. , on @xmath111 . in relation to this point",

    "however , just below that limit the fraction decreases significantly to values close to those found by glikman et al .",

    "@xmath249 and the uv - optical lines and continuum emission of the agn are heavily absorbed by the reservoir / torus and by the dust - rich ism .",
    "contrarily , unobscured sources are more likely selected after the onset of the qso wind , when the ism and the reservoir have been significantly impoverished .",
    "if we assume that the phase singled out by the x - ray absorbed qsos coincides with that of the red qsos , then on the basis of fig .  1 and the discussion in   3.2.2 , a rough estimation of a @xmath278 proportion between red and uv - selected qsos can be derived .    before the setting of qso winds , during the obscured phase ,",
    "the size of the highly ionized region of the ism surrounding the qsos is limited , since most of the uv and ionizing photons are heavily absorbed .",

    "( 2011 ) can be ascribed to such an effect , as also supported by the radiative transfer simulations by bolton et al .",
    "these authors found that the uv bright phase should have lasted for about @xmath280 yr . since ulasj112001.48",
    "+ 064124.3 exhibits @xmath281 , our model would predict a uv bright phase duration of about one @xmath4-folding time , which in the model at that redshift amounts to @xmath282 yr .",
    "the agreement is reasonable , taking into account the uncertainties associated to the data and modelization .",
    "interestingly , this example suggests that the early , dusty phase of qsos at very high redshift can be easily probed by the _ james webb space telescope _ with the nircam and miri instruments ( dickinson 2013 ) , as it can be explored at lower redshift with the wise all sky survey ( wright et al . 2010 ; banerji et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the agn feedback on the ism should manifest itself in terms of large outflows ( see fabian 2012 for a review ) , signalling the rapid expulsion of gas and the dramatic shutoff of the star formation .",
    "large outflows have been observed in relatively nearby galaxies hosting an active nucleus ( feruglio et al .",

    "these authors estimate an outflow rate @xmath287 yr@xmath17 capable of removing the gas in the host galaxy within @xmath288 yr .",
    "outflow rates predicted by our model for massive bhs ( see fig .",
    "19 ) range from several hundreds to several thousands @xmath289 yr@xmath17 ; at given mass the rates depend also on redshift , chiefly through the specific binding energy entering eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "the model also requires that before the peak of the nuclear activity there are weaker galactic winds mainly driven by stellar feedback , as observed in some starforming galaxies at substantial redshift ( alexander et al .",
    "2010 ; genzel et al .",
    "both agn and stellar feedbacks can remove a lot of cold gas from the central regions of galaxies , though on different timescales .",
    "for instance in sdssj114816.64 + 525150.3 the dynamical mass within a @xmath290 kpc radius is about twice the gas mass ( wang et al .",
    "the results of maiolino et al .",
    "( 2012 ) suggest that the central regions of the host are deprived by about half of their mass in @xmath291 yr .",
    "so these outflows must affect the inner structure of the host galaxies , as pointed out by several authors ( see fan et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 , 2013 ; damjanov et al . 2009 ; zubovas et al . 2013 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , while usually the agn feedback is invoked to turn off the star formation , the latter may occur in the outflowing shell ( see ishibashi & fabian 2012 ; silk 2013 ; zubovas et al .",
    "since fir selected samples show that the sfr is high even when the agn luminosity ( and hence the feedback ) is low , this mechanism can originate only a fraction of the total stellar mass , while still relevant with respect to the size of the host galaxy ( ishibashi & fabian 2012 ) .",
    "in particular , in the early phases of the evolution , the sn feedback is energetically larger than the agn one , and the observations reveal large stellar mass in the presence of large gas abundance and weak agn activity ( i.e. , low mass bh ) .    in summary , large outflows able to remove most of the ism from agn hosts",
    "are detected at least in one case and possibly in several others .",
    "we recall that even the short duration of the phase can significantly depress the statistics of outflow detection .",
    "for instance , in the case of sdssj114816.64 + 525150.3 the gas within a scale of @xmath169 kpc is going to be removed in @xmath292 yr , which is @xmath38 of the duration of the qso optical phase .",
    "here we first discuss the observational evidence on , and properties of the circumnuclear structures in local agns , related to the presence of a massive gas reservoir as predicted by the model ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "then by extrapolating the results of local observations to higher redshifts , we show that _ alma _ high resolution imaging and coordinated x - ray high resolution observations of strongly lensed ( sub-)mm selected galaxies can cast light on the epoch of stellar and bh mass growth . in the light of the above scenario ,",
    "we point out several physical mechanisms operating on different scales that can lead to the accretion of a fraction of the ism .      as shown in fig .",
    "3 the model predicts that around the central bh a gas reservoir soon sets up .",
    "its formation stems from the requirement of funnelling gas of low angular momentum at a rate proportional to the sfr , while the bh accretes in a self - regulated regime .",
    "such a structure could constitute a ( proto-)torus around the bh of the same kind as that observed at low redshift and often called for in order to explain the diversity of unobscured and obscured agns ( see   4.2 ) .",
    "this torus / reservoir , with size ranging from a few to several tens of parsecs , has been studied in detail only in nearby agns .",
    "high spatial resolution observations reveal that molecular gas and dust is largely present ( e.g. , muller - sanchez et al . 2009 ; krips et al . 2011 ; diamond - stanic & rieke 2012 ; sani et al .",

    "the model assumes that , when the star formation is active in the host galaxy , some mechanism is able to drive a fraction of the ism gas into the _ reservoir _ at a rate proportional to the sfr , according to eq .",
    "several physical mechanisms can cause a fraction of the gas in galaxies to lose angular momentum and to pile up in the very central regions .",
    "a non exhaustive list includes gas drag , dynamical friction of gas plus star clumps , tidal fields , spiral waves , winds and bars , radiation drag ( e.g. , norman & scoville 1988 ; shlosman et al .",

    "in general the presence of clumps , which may be generated by fragmentation of gas already organized in an unstable disc or by inflow of gas and star subclumps , tends to increase the efficiency of such mechanisms .    since the loss of angular momentum is a requirement",
    "also for the cold gas to collapse into clouds and to fragment into stars , the starburst activity and the agn fueling have been often associated .",
    "gravitational torques acting on gaseous and stellar disks can induce radial flows of the ism ( e.g. , shlosman et al .",
    "1989 , 1990 ) , thus increasing the central surface density , triggering star formation in the inner kpc scale and moving gas toward the @xmath283 pc region .",
    "such gravitational torques can be induced by external events , such as tidal encounters , orbital torques by satellites and minor / major mergers , or by internal instabilities related to infall , bars , asymmetries generated during the evolution of the gas plus star structure .",
    "disc instabilities also grow gaseous clumps that migrate toward the central regions by dynamical friction ( shlosman & noguchi 1993 ) . the clumps can then contribute to the formation of the bulge ( noguchi 1999 ; genzel et al .",

    "all these processes are expected to establish a kind of relationship between the rate of star formation , at least in the inner kpc scale , and the rate at which the gas is delivered toward the very central regions of the galaxy .",
    "hopkins & quataert ( 2010 , 2011 ) have explored in detail with numerical simulations the effects of gravitational torques ( externally or internally induced ) .",
    "they show that part of the ism gas is shocked and dissipates energy and angular momentum , flowing toward the central regions . on scales of @xmath316 pc such a gas can reach large surface densities , @xmath317 kpc@xmath64 .",
    "this gas can be identified with the reservoir / torus introduced in our model .    in summary",
    ", there are several physical mechanisms that can plausibly reduce the angular momentum at least for a fraction of the diffuse ism gas and drive it to migrate from kpc to @xmath96 pc scale at a rate proportional to the sfr of the host galaxy .",

    "we stress that data support a large variance in the coefficient @xmath98 appearing there , which looks quite plausible given the suggested mechanisms and the results of numerical simulations .",
    "once low angular momentum gas has accumulated in the reservoir , additional loss / tranfer of angular momentum is required in order to bring the gas toward the accretion disc at sub - parsec scales .",
    "some of the mechanisms at work on larger scales have been proposed to operate also on the smaller ones ; for instance , bars - in - bars instabilities ( shlosman et al . 1989 , 1990 ) , gravitational interactions and dynamical friction in clumped disc ( kumar 1999 ) have been proposed .",
    "several authors have pointed out that in the circumnuclear regions on parsec scales the gas is very likely rich in metals and dust , prone to fragment in clumps and to form stars . on the one hand ,",
    "the stellar feedback can remove part of the gas from the reservoir ; on the other hand , it can favor the gas to flow toward the accretion disc ( e.g. , wada & norman 2001 , 2002 ; thompson et al .",

    "thompson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find two possible classes of circumnuclear discs depending on the rate at which the gas is supplied : discs with star formation large enough to consume most of the available gas and with practically no accretion onto the central bh ; alternatively , discs with large star formation only at their periphery , still leaving enough gas to ensure significant accretion .",

    "likely , in the balance the overall mass of long living stars formed in the reservoir should be much less than the mass accreted onto the bh ; this does not imply that the star formation is not important in helping the bh feeding , as mentioned above .      in order to fit the observed statistics of both ( sub-)mm / fir and x - ray selected objects at @xmath262",

    "<S> we exploit the recent , wide samples of far - infrared ( fir ) selected galaxies followed - up in x rays and of x - ray / optically selected active galactic nuclei ( agns ) followed - up in the fir band , along with the classic data on agn and stellar luminosity functions at high redshift @xmath0 , to probe different stages in the coevolution of supermassive black holes ( bhs ) and host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our analysis indicate the following scenario : ( i ) the star formation in the host galaxy proceeds within a heavily dust - enshrouded medium at an almost constant rate over a timescale @xmath1 gyr , and then abruptly declines due to quasar feedback ; over the same timescale , ( ii ) part of the interstellar medium loses angular momentum , reaches the circum - nuclear regions at a rate proportional to the star formation and is temporarily stored into a massive reservoir / proto - torus wherefrom it can be promptly accreted ; ( iii ) the bh grows by accretion in a self - regulated regime with radiative power that can slightly exceed the eddington limit @xmath2 , particularly at the highest redshifts ; ( iv ) for massive bhs the ensuing energy feedback at its maximum exceeds the stellar one and removes the interstellar gas , thus stopping the star formation and the fueling of the reservoir ; ( v ) afterwards , if the latter has retained enough gas , a phase of supply - limited accretion follows exponentially declining with a timescale of about @xmath3 @xmath4-folding times . </S>",
