    "[ fig : dilution](b ) implies that this may not be the case . in consequence , and for the sake of simplicity , further analysis of the @xmath19 frequency in this paper is based on the torque results .    as indicated by arpes@xcite , the small diamond - shaped pockets centered around the x point of the bz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multifigure ] ) remain unmodified in the presence of the cdw .",
    "band structure calculations were performed for the unmodulated structure of late@xmath0 , using the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method within the atomic sphere approximation , including combined - correction terms.@xcite these calculations show that the inner x pocket has minimal and maximal fs areas corresponding to 2.14% and 2.79% of the bz area , while the outer x pocket has minimal and maximal areas of 3.68% and 3.82% of the bz area.@xcite the measured @xmath19 frequencies , which correspond to similar fs areas , can thus be ascribed to these unmodified x pockets .    while in principle",
    "each of these four distinct frequencies should be observed in the measured data at @xmath32 = 0 , in practice the finite fourier transform resolution for the experimental conditions results in just two distinct frequencies at @xmath32 near zero . as the lmto band structure calculations indicate that the bilayer splitting is larger than the @xmath46-axis dispersion for both sheets ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multifigure](c ) ) , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are tentatively assigned to the inner and outer x pockets respectively .",
    "an alternative interpretation would be that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are associated with the minimum and maximum of the inner x pocket , which would give a closer correspondence between calculated and measured areas .",
    "however this would imply that no frequencies are observed from the outer x pocket , even though both sheets are expected to be present in the reconstructed fs .",
    "as @xmath32 is increased from zero , each of @xmath24 and @xmath25 splits into two peaks , and it is tempting to ascribe these split peaks @xmath36 and @xmath37 to the neck and belly frequencies of the inner x pocket , and similarly for @xmath38 and @xmath39 to the neck and belly frequencies of the outer x pocket .",
    "but a simple sinusoidal @xmath2-axis dispersion should give neck and belly frequencies that are distinct at @xmath47 but then converge with increasing @xmath32 before meeting at a yamaji angle@xcite .",
    "the divergent behaviors of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 , could reflect deviations from a simple sinusoidal @xmath46-axis dispersion .",
    "alternatively , given that late@xmath0 is prone to twining due to the weak van der waals bonding between the double te sheets , it is possible that there are grains in the sample that are misoriented within the plane by 90@xmath23 , so that as @xmath32 increases some grains could be rotating around the @xmath17-axis while other grains are rotating around the @xmath18-axis .",
    "if these different rotation directions have different angle - dependencies , then this could cause single peaks near @xmath32 = 0 to split into multiple peaks at higher angles .",
    "the measured cyclotron masses for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 frequencies are @xmath44 = 0.175(1)@xmath48 and 0.183(1)@xmath48 , respectively . these can be compared with the band masses @xmath49 for undressed quasiparticles where @xmath50 = 1 + @xmath51 and @xmath51 is the electron - phonon coupling parameter .",

    "fitting the extracted @xmath21 oscillations to an exponential dependence results in @xmath56 = 52(6 ) t , and using the previously obtained value of @xmath55 leads to @xmath53 = 1.2(1 ) @xmath66 , with an @xmath1 value of 3.05 .",
    "this is smaller than the smallest possible value for @xmath1 ( that of a circle with @xmath67 = 2@xmath68 = 3.54 ) , which presumably reflects uncertainty in the exponents extracted from both the @xmath19 and @xmath21 orbits .",
    "nevertheless , the implication that the @xmath21 orbit is associated with a fs sheet that has a large cross - sectional area with respect to the circumference indicates that the geometry of this largest section of reconstructed fs is not significantly elongated ( as implied by arpes measurements)@xcite , but rather more closely approximates a circle .    repeating the same analysis for the @xmath20 frequency results in a circumference of 0.44(2 ) @xmath66 which corresponds to an @xmath1 value of 5.8(3 ) , which is significantly larger than that of a circle . if the fs were an ellipse with the given area and circumference , it would have a semi - major axis 5 times greater than its semi - minor axis ( 0.097 @xmath66 vs. 0.0185 @xmath66 ) .    finally , we comment on the fraction of the fs volume in the cdw state relative to that of the unmodified fs .",
    "optical conductivity measurements have suggested that for late@xmath0 as little as 2% of the original fs volume remains in the gapped state.@xcite given that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands are approximately 5/8 filled in the unmodulated structure,@xcite and that the 2d nature of the fs gives an easy correspondence between fs volume and area , this roughly corresponds to a fs area of 2% of 5/8 of the bz for the gapped state .",
    "our larger values of 7.65(5)% of a bz for @xmath21 , and 2.44(1)% and 2.60(1)% for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , indicate that substantially more of the fs remains in the gapped state than is indicated by the optical conductivity results.@xcite",

    "a pair of frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath25 representing areas of 2.44(1)% and 2.60(1)% of the brillouin zone , respectively , can be correlated with the unmodified x pocket of the fs from the average structure , a bilayer - split pocket which has been confirmed by arpes to exist in the cdw state .",
    "the other frequencies@xmath20 , corresponding to 0.28(1)% of the bz and @xmath21 corresponding to 7.65(5)% of the bz  must result from fs sheets reconstructed by the cdw wavevector .",
