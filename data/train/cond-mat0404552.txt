    "comparing the lattices will be a further check for the validity of a local potential approximation for the confined system .",

    "the results shown below have been obtained for a geometry with @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .    to simplify simulations , we linearize the quadratic potential , @xmath85 and set @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the difference in chemical potential between two neighboring legs . in our simulations",

    "note that all data from simulations using different values of @xmath91 collapse onto a single curve .",
    "due to the equivalence of all sites on the ladder with the same value of the chemical potential , this data collapse is expected in the ladder model , where changing @xmath91 by an amount of @xmath94 corresponds to a shift in the index of each chain in the ladder .",
    "[ fig : ladder : lcomp ] also shows the results obtained for the realistic trap , as described in the previous section . both results _",
    "coincide almost perfectly _ , which is a strong justification for the validity of the effective model and the applicability of a local potential approximation .",
    "the small differences can be attributed to the different shape of the trapping potential which is parabolic for the realistic trap , but linearized in the ladder model . while differences in the densities are small , the compressibility , which is the derivative of the density , is more sensitive , marking the lack of universality .    in particular , we find that the ladder model does not show cusp - like features in the boundary regions between the superfluid and the mott plateaux , similar to the realistic 2d trap .",
    "we thus conclude , that structural quenching in the rotational symmetric trap on the square lattice is not the reason for the apparent absence of quantum criticality since similar behavior is also found on the polar lattice , i.e. in the ladder model .",
    "we expect similar features also to be obtained for 3d traps using the effective multilayer model .",
    "having shown that the ladder model captures important features of the realistic trap even quantitatively , we now discuss possible quantum criticality in confined systems .    performing the thermodynamic limit in the uniform case does not change the model parameters apart from increasing the number of lattice sites . on the other hand , standard thermodynamic limit definitions for the confined case  @xcite",
    "imply a decrease in the trapping potential s curvature @xmath66 , such that @xmath95 such a procedure locally drives the system towards the uniform regime , since for lattice sites with a given value of @xmath67 , the gradient in the confinement potential eventually becomes irrelevant on the scale set by the correlation length in their neighborhood .",

    "<S> we study properties of ultra - cold bosonic atoms in one , two and three dimensional optical lattices by large scale quantum monte carlo simulations of the bose hubbard model in parabolic confinement potentials . </S>",
    "<S> local phase structures of the atoms are shown to be accessible via a well defined local compressibility , quantifying a global response of the system to a local perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> an indicator for the presence of extended mott plateaux is shown to stem from the shape of the coherent component of the momentum distribution function , amenable to experimental detection . </S>",
    "<S> additional fine structures in the momentum distribution are found to appear unrelated to the local phase structure , disproving previous claims . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss limitations of local potential approximations for confined bose gases , and the absence of quantum criticality and critical slowing down in parabolic confinement potentials , thus accounting for the fast dynamics in establishing phase coherence in current experiments . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , we find that flat confinement potentials allow quantum critical behavior to be observed already on moderately sized optical lattices . </S>",
    "<S> our results furthermore demonstrate , that the experimental detection of the mott transition would be significantly eased in flat confinement potentials . </S>"
