    "the problem of computing the topological features of a space has recently drawn much attention from researchers in various fields , such as high - dimensional data analysis @xcite , graphics @xcite , networks @xcite and computational biology @xcite .",
    "topological features are often preferable to purely geometric features , as they are more qualitative and global , and tend to be more robust . if the goal is to characterize a space , therefore , features which incorporate topology seem to be good candidates .",
    "once we are able to compute topological features , a natural problem is to rank the features according to their importance .",
    "the significance of this problem can be justified from two perspectives .",
    "first , unavoidable errors are introduced in data acquisition , in the form of traditional signal noise , and finite sampling of continuous spaces .",
    "these errors may lead to the presence of many small topological features that are not `` real '' , but are simply artifacts of noise or of sampling @xcite .",
    "second , many problems are naturally hierarchical . this hierarchy  which is a kind of multiscale or multi - resolution decomposition",
    " implies that we want to capture the large scale features first .",
    "see figure [ fig : motiv1 ] and [ fig : motiv2 ] for examples .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in this section , we present the procedure for testing whether a subcomplex @xmath4 carries any nonbounding cycle of @xmath3 .",
    "a chain in @xmath4 is a cycle if and only if it is a cycle of @xmath3 .",
    "however , solely from @xmath4 , we are not able to tell whether a cycle carried by @xmath4 bounds or not in @xmath3 . instead , we write the set of cycles of @xmath3 carried by @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and the set of boundaries of @xmath3 carried by @xmath4 , @xmath6 , as sets of linear combinations with certain constraints",
    ". consequently , we are able to test whether any cycle carried by @xmath4 is nonbounding in @xmath3 by comparing their dimensions .",
    "formally , we define @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 $ ] be the matrix whose column vectors are arbitrary @xmath10 nonbounding cycles of @xmath3 which are not homologous to each other .",
    "the boundary group and the cycle group of @xmath3 are column spaces of the matrices @xmath11 and @xmath12 $ ] , respectively . using finite field linear algebra , we have the following theorem , whose proof is omitted due to space limitations .",
    "[ thm : cycletest ] @xmath4 carries nonbounding cycles of @xmath3 if and only if @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the @xmath16-th rows of the matrices @xmath11 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "we use the algorithm of wiedemann@xcite for the rank computation . in our algorithm ,",
    "the boundary matrix @xmath11 is given .",
    "the matrix @xmath18 can be precomputed as follows .",
    "we perform a column reduction on the boundary matrix @xmath19 to compute a basis for the cycle group @xmath20 .",
    "we check elements in this basis one by one until we collect @xmath10 of them forming @xmath18 . for each cycle",
    "@xmath21 in this cycle basis , we check whether @xmath21 is linearly independent of the @xmath22-boundaries and the nonbounding cycles we have already chosen .",
    "more details are omitted due to space limitations .",
    "in this section , we address the localization problem .",
    "we formalize the localization problem as a combinatorial optimization problem : given a simplcial complex @xmath3 , compute the representative cycle of a given homology class minimizing a certain objective function .",
    "formally , given an objective function defined on all the cycles , @xmath23 , we want to localize a given class with its _ optimally localized cycle _",
    ", @xmath24 . in general , we assume the class @xmath25 is given by one of its representative cycles , @xmath26 .",
    "we explore three options of the objective function @xmath27 , i.e.  the _ volume _ , _ diameter _ and _ radius _ of a given cycle @xmath21 .",
    "we show that the cycle with the minimal volume and the cycle with the minimal diameter are np - hard to compute .",
    "the cycle with the minimal radius , which is the localized - cycle we defined and computed in previous sections , is a fair choice . due to space limitations",
    ", we omit proofs of theorems in this section .",
    "[ def : vol ] the volume of @xmath21 is the number of its simplices , @xmath28 .    for example , the volume of a 1-dimensional cycle , a 2-dimensional cycle and a 3-dimensional cycle are the numbers of their edges , triangles and tetrahedra , respectively .",
    "a cycle with the smallest volume , denoted as @xmath29 , is consistent to a `` well - localized '' cycle in intuition .",
    "its 1-dimensional version , the shortest cycle of a class , has been studied by researchers @xcite .",
    "however , we prove in theorem [ thm : optvol ] that computing @xmath29 of @xmath25 is np - hard .",
    "the proof is by reduction from the np - hard problem max-2sat - b @xcite .",
    "more generally , we can extend the the volume to be the sum of the weights assigned to simplices of the cycle , given an arbitrary weight function defined on all the simplices of @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding smallest cycle is still np - hard to compute .",
    "[ thm : optvol ] computing @xmath29 for a given @xmath25 is np - hard .",
    "when it is np - hard to compute @xmath29 , one may resort to the geodesic distance between elements of @xmath21 .",
    "the second choice of the objective function is the diameter .",
    "[ def : diam ] the diameter of a cycle is the diameter of its vertex set , @xmath30 , in which the diameter of a set of vertices is the maximal geodesic distance between them , formally , @xmath31 .",
    "intuitively , a representative cycle of @xmath25 with the minimal diameter , denoted @xmath32 , is the cycle whose vertices are as close to each other as possible .",
    "the intuition will be further illustrated by comparison against the radius criterion .",
    "we prove in theorem [ thm : optdiam ] that computing @xmath32 of @xmath25 is np - hard , by reduction from the np - hard _ multiple - choice cover problem _",
    "( mccp ) of arkin and hassin @xcite .",
    "[ thm : optdiam ] computing @xmath32 for a given @xmath25 is np - hard .",
    "the third option of the objective function is the radius .",
    "the radius of a cycle is the radius of the smallest geodesic ball carrying it , formally , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the sets of vertices of the given simplicial complex @xmath3 and the cycle @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the representative cycle with the minimal radius , denoted as @xmath36 , is the same as the localized - cycle defined and computed in previous sections .",
    "intuitively , @xmath36 is the cycle whose vertices are as close to a vertex of @xmath3 as possible .",
    "however , @xmath36 may not necessarily be localized in intuition .",
    "it may wiggle a lot while still being carried by the smallest geodesic ball carrying the class .",
    "see figure [ fig : wiggle1 ] , in which we localize the only nontrivial homology class of an annulus ( the light gray area ) .",
    "the dark gray area is the smallest geodesic ball carrying the class , whose center is @xmath37 .",
    "besides , the cycle with the minimal diameter ( figure [ fig : wiggle2 ] ) avoids this wiggling problem and is concise in intuition .",
    "this in turn justifies the choice of diameter . in the left ,",
    "its diameter is twice of its radius . for the cycle @xmath32 in the center , its diameter is equal to its radius . ]",
    "we can prove that @xmath36 can be computed in polynomial time and is a 2-approximation of @xmath32 .",
    "we can compute @xmath36 in polynomial time .",
    "[ thm : radapxdiam ] @xmath38 .",
    "this bound is a tight bound . in figure [ fig : wiggle1 ] and [ fig : wiggle2 ] , the diameter of the cycle @xmath36 is twice of the radius of the dark gray geodesic ball .",
    "the diameter of the cycle @xmath32 is the same as the radius of the ball .",
    "we have @xmath39 .    -0.3 cm",
