    "the anderson model of localization has been a subject of intense analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite studies for decades .",
    "anderson in his seminal paper@xcite had demonstrated that , at absolute zero temperature and in the absence of external fields and electron - electron interactions , a sufficiently strong disorder can drive a transition from a metallic to an insulating state ( mit ) .",

    "a characteristic feature of this critical transition is the strong multifractality of its wavefunction amplitudes.@xcite the critical eigenstate being neither extended nor localized reveals large fluctuations of wavefunction amplitudes at all length scales .",

    "it can be computed from the @xmath2-th moments of the inverse participation ratio @xmath3 which defines the scaling behaviour of @xmath4 with length @xmath5.@xcite the anomalous exponents @xmath6 determine the scale dependence of the wave function correlations @xcite and separate the critical point from the metallic phase ( for which @xmath7 ) . by carrying out such a multifractal analysis@xcite ( mfa )",
    "various critical properties can be obtained such as the critical disorder @xmath8,@xcite the position of the mobility edges and the disorder - energy phase diagram,@xcite as well as the critical exponents of the localization length.@xcite    from an analytical viewpoint not much is known about the singularity spectrum .",
    "an approximate expression can be obtained in the regime of weak multifractality , i.e.  when the critical point is close to a metallic behaviour .",
    "this applies to the anderson transition in @xmath9 dimensions with @xmath10 . in this case",
    "a parabolic dependence of the spectrum is found as @xmath11 ^ 2}/{4\\epsilon}$],@xcite which in turn implies @xmath12 .",
    "although the parabolic approximation has turned out to be exact for some models,@xcite its validity , in particular for the integer quantum hall transition , is currently under an intense debate @xcite due to the implications that this result has upon the critical theories describing the transition .",
    "it is only in the thermodynamic limit where a true critical point exists and hence the true critical @xmath0 can be obtained . since the numerical characterization of the multifractal properties of @xmath13 at the mit",
    "can only be obtained from finite - size states , one therefore has to consider averages over different realizations of the disorder . due to the nature of the distribution of @xmath3,@xcite one",
    "would normally take the _",
    "typical _ average which is exactly the geometric average of the moments of @xmath3 over all contributions .",
    "the use of typical averaging for the mfa has been successfully implemented in various studies.@xcite    remarkably , it was recently argued that an exact _ symmetry relation _ should hold for the anomalous scaling exponents,@xcite @xmath14 which for the singularity spectrum is translated into , @xmath15 this relation implies that the singularity strength @xmath16 must be contained in the interval @xmath17 $ ] and that the values of @xmath0 for @xmath18 can be mapped to the values for @xmath19 , and vice versa .",
