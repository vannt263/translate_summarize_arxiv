    "fig . 1 presents the result of an angular - dependent study performed at t=0.49 k and up to 12 t. as previously reported@xcite , the nernst response shows quantum oscillations with a period ( 0.147 t@xmath2 ) matching the cross section of the hole ellipsoid . in this configuration , the nernst response , like other transport properties such as resistivity@xcite and the hall effect@xcite is dominated by holes . the lower mobility of carriers traveling perpendicular to the trigonal axis on an electron ellipsoid@xcite makes them less visible in a transport experiment . on the other hand , torque magnetometry@xcite , a probe of anisotropic magnetization is dominated by the electron ellipsoids .",
    "the latter are much more anisotropic than the hole ellipsoid and their diamagnetic response is enhanced by their dirac - like dispersion .    as the field was tilted in the ( trigonal , binary ) plane of the crystal , the main peaks barely moved .",
    "but the structure visible between large peaks rapidly evolves with tilt angle , @xmath3 , as seen by arrows tracking one of the smaller nernst peaks .",
    "1c presents a color map of the nernst response in the ( b , @xmath3 ) plane together with the position of the smaller nernst peaks .",
    "one can clearly distinguish between two different field scales .",
    "the first are quasi - horizontal field scales , caused by the passage of hole landau levels as previously identified@xcite .",
    "the second group of field scales are less prominent in the data and present a very sharp angular variation .",
    "their coordinates in the ( b , @xmath3 ) plane coincides with the torque anomalies in the same field window@xcite and we thus deduce that they are by the passage of the landau levels of the electron pockets in agreement with the predictions of both sets of theoretical calculations@xcite .",
    "in particular , the electron spectrum calculated by alicea and balents @xcite appears to be in quantitative agreement with our data .",
    "note the presence of a small nernst peak ( marked by a green arrow ) , which rapidly disappears as the field is tilted off the trigonal axis .",
    "this field scale is the only feature of our data to be absent in the torque data in this field window .",
    "2 presents the nernst data taken with a rotating set - up at t= 1.5 k in a dc resistive magnet up to 28 t. as the field is tilted off the trigonal axis , the structure of the nernst response above 9 t evolves .",
    "panel b of the same figure presents a color map of the nernst response in the ( b , @xmath3 ) plane , which clearly exposes the strongly anisotropic field scales discovered by li _",
    "_ in their angular - dependent torque magnetometry experiments@xcite .",
    "these field scales trace quasi - vertical lines in the ( b , @xmath3 ) plane .",
    "in addition to these two lines , there are three additional field scales above 9 t , which cross the @xmath4 axis close to the position of the three anomalies detected in the earlier nernst experiment with a field nominally along the trigonal axis , but with no _ in situ _ control of orientation@xcite .",
    "the detection of these two distinct field scales by the same experiment definitely rules out the misalignment scenario proposed@xcite as an explanation for the unexpected nernst anomalies@xcite . in this spectrum ,",
    "the two quasi - vertical lines correspond to the passage of an electron ellipsoid sub - level ( labeled 0@xmath5 ) through the chemical potential as the field is tilted@xcite .",
    "first detected by torque magnetometry@xcite , they are also visible in angular - dependent magnetoresistance data@xcite .",
    "we also used a two - axis rotation set - up , which allowed us to delimit the triangular around the trigonal axis formed by the intersection of each of the three 0@xmath5 sub - levels with the fermi level .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "3 , even at 28 t , this triangle has a finite size allowing us to identify the trigonal axis .",
    "we checked the presence of the three ultraquantum nernst peaks in such a configuration with a virtually perfect alignment of the magnetic field .",
    "their angular dependence of these peaks is much weaker that the two quasi - vertical lines which delimit the central region .",
    "this may suggest an explanation for their absence in the torque data@xcite .",
    "there is no torque when the field is strictly aligned along the trigonal axis .",
    "when the field is tilted , the torque response , which is proportional to the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility , is dominated by the more anisotropic field scales . as pointed out by li and co - workers@xcite , in a torque study sweeping @xmath3 , the ellipsoid @xmath6 of fig.1a , for example , is invisible because of its negligible contribution to anisotropic magnetization .    a striking feature of the fig . 2b and fig .",
    "3b , is the absence of mirror symmetry between positive and negative @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "2b , the line crossing @xmath7=0 at 18 t does not respect the reflection symmetry of the crystal .",
    "moreover , in fig .",
    "3b , the legs of the triangle delimiting the central region around the trigonal axis do not display the same intensity .",
    "it is unlikely that these features arise because of a residual imperfection in controlling the field orientation , in particular in the latter case , as the two axis set - up scans a solid angle .",
    "4 presents the data obtained at different temperatures when the field is aligned along the trigonal axis .",
    "the thermal evolution of the quantum oscillations confirms the identification of nernst peaks according to their angular dependence .",
    "the hole peaks are more robust than the electron peaks as the sample is warmed up . at t=4.3 k , while the electron peaks are already smeared out , hole peaks persist .",
    "the persistence of the hole peaks up to higher temperatures is in agreement with their lighter effective mass in this configuration ( @xmath8 for holes and @xmath9@xcite ) .",
    "the lower panel presents the high - field nernst signal as a function of the inverse of the magnetic field , with the magnetic field aligned along the trigonal axis with our two - axis set - up .",
    "the three ultraquantum anomalies fade away with warming almost at the same temperature as the low - field peaks clearly identified as those associated with electron ellipsoids . at t=5",
    "k , the hole anomalies are still present , but the ultraquantum peaks are all wiped out .",
    "this observation points to electron ellipsoids as the source of the three high - field anomalies .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by the size of the latter matched to electron and hole peaks below the quantum limit .",
    "controlling the orientation of the magnetic field with sub - degree accuracy allows us to confirm the complex theoretical one - particle spectrum of bismuth at high magnetic fields@xcite in its basic lines . for the first time",
    ", nernst peaks associated with the very anisotropic electron ellipsoids can be clearly identified thanks to their sharp angular variation , which is in very good agreement with theory@xcite as well as the torque data by li and co - workers@xcite .",
    "the second and more important conclusion of this study is that the three high - field nernst peaks reported previously are not one of these anomalies caused by the intersection of a landau level and the chemical potential .",
    "it has been recently pointed out that when the field is tilted off the trigonal axis , the large electron - phonon coupling can lead to redistribution of carriers between pockets and sharp transport features may arise even in the one - particle picture@xcite .",
    "therefore , the presence of the anomalous nernst peaks with a virtually perfect alignment between the magnetic field and the trigonal axis is particularly significant . as seen in fig .",
    "4 , the nernst peaks resolved in this configuration smoothly vanish with warming and there is no detectable critical temperature . moreover , their field position does not shift with temperature .",
    "these peaks are not signatures of a thermodynamic phase transition such as the one which occurs in graphite , believed to be a field - induced density - wave ( dw ) transition@xcite .",
    "bismuth , in contrast with graphite , keeps its metallicity up to a magnetic field as large as 55 t@xcite .",
    "we conclude that at magnetic fields of 12.5 t , 18.2 t and 25.7 t , for which , according to the one - particle picture , the fermi level is between one occupied and one empty landau level of all three electron pockets , the nernst signal peaks as if there was a landau level crossing .",
    "this is also the case of the peak at 6.9 t ( green symbols in fig.1 and fig.4a ) .",
    "we also note that the large nernst peak of 38 t , resolved previously and associated with the hole pocket@xcite , occurs when according to the theoretical one - particle spectrum , the chemical potential is between the occupied 0@xmath10 and the empty 1@xmath10 landau level .",
    "what occurs at these fields is not a thermodynamical phase transition associated to a symmetry breaking order parameter , but a topological@xcite one , which occurs each time a landau ( sub-)level intersects the fermi level@xcite .",
    "when the bottom of a landau level intersects the fermi level , there is a sharp enhancement in entropy per carrier and thus a nernst peak@xcite . in the presence of zeeman coupling ,",
    "the degeneracy associated with spin degrees of freedom is lifted and sub - levels emerge .",
    "the challenge for theory is to find a mechanism to produce additional landau sub - levels and leading to nernst peaks at particular magnetic fields . since the three electron valleys are degenerate when the field is along the trigonal axis , the valley degrees of freedom are a natural direction to look .",
    "however , as long as the three valleys are strictly identical , a field along the trigonal axis is not expected to lift this degeneracy . very recently , a new theoretical scenario invoking spontaneous valley polarization as a result of electron interaction has emerged and may prove to be relevant to our results@xcite . in particular , this scenario would provide a natural explanation for the absence of rotational symmetry in our high - field data .    in summary ,",
    "the study of the angular - dependent nernst response fine tunes the challenge addressed to theory .",
    "first of all , the complex theoretical one - particle spectrum of bismuth at high magnetic fields@xcite is confirmed in its basic lines .",
    "nernst peaks associated with the very anisotropic electron ellipsoids are clearly detected and are in very good agreement with both calculations@xcite and the torque data@xcite .",
    "more importantly , _ none _ of the three high - field nernst peaks reported previously@xcite are caused by the intersection of a landau level and the fermi level in the one - particle spectrum .",
    "finally , the temperature dependence of the anomalous nernst peaks clearly links them to the electron ellipsoids .",
    "the origin of these additional landau sub - levels , unexpected in the non - interacting picture , remains an open question .",
    "in total , five bismuth single crystals with a length between 2 to 5 mm and a thickness between 0.5 to 2.1 mm were studied . their residual resistivity ratio ( rrr : that is the change in resistance from room temperature to 4.2 k ) of these samples ranged from 40 to 120 . in all five crystals , for a field aligned with sub - degree accuracy along the trigonal axis",
    ", the three ultraquantum nernst peaks were found to occur at the same magnetic field ( within a window of 1 t ) .",
    "the anomalies were more pronounced in the samples with the highest rrr ) .",
    "the nernst coefficient was measured with a standard one - heater - two - thermometer set - up .",
    "both the heater and the thermometers were ruo@xmath11 chips attached to the sample through silver wires .",
    "the set - up was rotated using a piezoelectric linear positioner provided by the attocube company ( www.attocube.de ) .",
    "a one - axis rotation set - up ( allowing a rotation window of 20 degrees ) was used to measure the angular - dependent nernst effect in a dilution refrigerator down to 0.18 k and in presence of a superconducting magnet up to 12 t. the same set - up was then used to study the nernst effect and its angular - dependence in a dc resistive magnet of lncmi - grenoble up to 28 t and down to 1.5 k.      the angle between the magnetic field and the sample was determined using a hall sensor attached to the rotating stage . in the case of the two - axis set - up , we used two perpendicular hall sensors to determine the two angles .",
    "the relative accuracy of angular determination was about 0.05 degree .",

    "<S> all such peaks are resolved by the experiment and their complex angular - dependence is in very good agreement with the theory . beyond the quantum limit , we resolve additional nernst peaks signaling a cascade of additional landau sub - levels caused by electron interaction .    </S>",

    "<S> the deduced structure consists of one hole ellipsoid aligned perpendicular to the plane in which lay obliquely three slightly tilted electron ellipsoids ( fig.1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> later investigations , carried out during the following decades , led to a quantitative description of the size , the orientation , and the position of these four ellipsoids@xcite . when the magnetic field is aligned along the highest symmetry axis , known as the trigonal axis , a field of 9 t allows one to attain the quantum limit putting carriers in their lowest landau level .    </S>",
    "<S> the nernst response in this configuration has been recently found to sharply peak each time a landau level empties , generating giant quantum oscillations@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this particular nernst profile , absent in two - dimensional systems , has been recently observed in bulk graphite @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it points to electronic degrees of freedom _ along _ the magnetic field as a source of transverse in - plane thermoelectric response . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to its two - dimensional counterpart@xcite , the theoretical description of the nernst effect in a three - dimensional system in the vicinity of the quantum limit has only recently begun to be explored@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the extension of the nernst measurements to fields as high as 33 t led to the observation of three nernst peaks above 9 t@xcite , where no more landau level crossing were expected . </S>",
    "<S> the latter observation raised the issue of collective effects in a three - dimensional electron gas at high magnetic field where coulomb interaction and associated many - body instabilities are expected to become significant@xcite and the adequacy of the band picture , which treats electrons as non - interacting entities , remains an open question . </S>",
    "<S> several recent theoretical studies explored the limits on the survival of the fractional quantum hall effect in the presence of finite interlayer coupling@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> subsequent experimental work found that in strong magnetic field , both bismuth@xcite and bi@xmath0sb@xmath1@xcite are far from featureless . </S>",
    "<S> transport and thermodynamic coefficients were found to display unexpected anomalies beyond the quantum limit . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , angular - dependent torque magnetometry measurements detected a field scale quite distinct from the nernst anomalies and identified this field scale as a phase transition implying the massive dirac electrons of the three electron ellipsoids@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> both sets of high - field anomalies found in the two previous studies@xcite are present and easily distinguishable in our data . according to our findings </S>",
    "<S> , the one - particle picture is relevant yet insufficient . </S>",
    "<S> the nernst peaks caused by the emptying of a landau level , closely follow the theoretically expected angular path . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , there are three unexpected nernst peaks which can not be associated with any landau level . according to the non - interacting picture </S>",
    "<S> , the nernst peaks occur at a field when the fermi energy is located _ between _ landau levels and no sharp feature in the density of states is expected . </S>",
