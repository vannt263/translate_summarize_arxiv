    "at low excitation energy the nucleus deexcites by binary sequential decay .",
    "this is envisaged by the compound nucleus hypothesis .",
    "it is usually believed that beyond a certain excitation , binary decay gives way to simultaneous break up @xcite .",
    "this break up may well depend upon the details of collision , i.e. , whether the energy was pumped in by heavy ion collisions or say , by a proton hitting a nucleus .",
    "for multifragmentation , it is conjectured that the nucleus expands to three / four times the normal volume and breaks up into various fragments , dictated by phase space .",
    "calculations based on this picture have been successful in fitting many data .",
    "the smm ( statistical multifragmentation model ) uses these ideas and predicted ( well before any experiments ) that one should see a maximum in the specific heat at temperatures around 5 mev @xcite .",
    "this was indeed found @xcite .",
    "the appearence of a maximum in the specific heat led to a very interesting speculation that this may be a signature of phase transition .",
    "this is more dramatically demonstrated in the canoncal thermodynamic model ( which is in the same spirit as the smm but is much easier to implement ) . here at low temperature there is a large blob of matter which breaks up into many pieces and the maximum in specific heat",
    "is obtained in this region .",
    "the thermodynamic model can be extrapolated to large numbers of particles . in this limit",
    "it is shown that the break up is very sudden as a function of temperature .",
    "this is a case of first order phase transition and the maximum of specific heat is obtained at the phase transition @xcite .",
    "the beginning of such models started with bevalac energy collisions where it was natural to assume that the system formed by collisions is first compressed and then begins to decompress . during the decompression stage , the products in terms of mass numbers , velocities etc",
    "will evolve finally reaching a just streaming stage . while the changes will be continuous",
    "one can probably get an adequate description by assuming that all the changes can be described by assuming a constant freeze - out volume and doing a phase - space calculation ( thermodynamics ) at this volume .",
    "one can use the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck microscopic simulations @xcite in support of an initial compression , followed by expansion and finally free streaming .",
    "it is of course clear that a calculation of the caloric curve based on such models is not , in any simple way , connected to a variational principle .",
    "the present work is inspired by a recent calculation which showed that , in a different model based on a variational principle , a plateau in the caloric curve ( hence a maximum in specific heat ) can be reached in mononuclear configurations as well @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the nucleus expands when excitation energy is pumped in .",
    "adopt a reasonable density profile for the ground state and assume that when energy is pumped into the nucleus , it expands in a self - similar fashion , i.e. , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a function of the excitation energy @xmath2 .",
    "this excitation energy @xmath2 consists of two parts : a thermal part and a compression part which , as a function of density , increases quadratically about the ground state density @xcite . at a given excitation energy ,",
    "the nucleus expands till it reaches the maximum entropy ( this is the variational principle of the calculation )",
    ". effects of interaction on entropy is taken through a parametrisation of @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the effective mass .",
    "a temperature is defined microcanonically .",
    "the authors then find that when they plot temperature against excitation energy , a plateau is found around 5 to 6 mev .",
    "our investigation addresses the question of mononuclear configuration but with the following restriction .",
    "there is no surface in our calculation thus we are investigating break up as a volume effect .",
    "stated differently , our calculation refers to nuclear matter .",
    "this restriction was dictated by our desire to do a more microscopic calculation . in @xcite",
    "excitation energy is fixed .",
    "we do calculations first with fixed temperatures ( this is a more well - known practice in nuclear physics ) but then also do calculations with fixed energies . in both the approaches ,",
    "the nucleus first expands as the temperature increases , a plateau is reached but then the nucleus breaks up quite suddenly . once the nucleus breaks up , the model gives no guidance how the caloric curve is to be calculated further , into higher energy . in order to continue one needs to formulate a different model .",
    "a familiar model in nuclear physics which allows study of the caloric curve in mononuclear configurations is the temparature dependent mean field model ( hartee - fock and/or thomas - fermi model ) .",
    "this has certain advantages .",
    "when one does a standard mean field calculation at a fixed temparture , one minimises the free energy @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this means that when we get the self - consistent solution at a given temperature , we have obtained a solution which has zero pressure .",
    "if we draw a caloric curve with energies of these solutions this caloric curve pertains to zero pressure .",
    "the specific heat that we will get will be @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "investigation of the caloric curve with temperature - dependent thomas - fermi theory was done in the past @xcite . for nuclei @xmath8sm and @xmath9kr caloric curves",
    "were drawn and a maximum in specific heat at temperature @xmath1010 mev was found .",
    "but there is ambiguity whether the systems stay mononuclear or not .",
    "the cause of the ambiguity is this . in finite temperature",
    "mean field theory ( whether thomas - fermi or hartree - fock ) single particle states in the continuum are admixed through the finite temperature occupation factors . these calculations are done in a finite box and because of this admixture to the continuum , the resulting density distributions become strongly dependent on the volume of the box . thus in fig .",
    "2 . of @xcite at temperature 10 mev",
    "if the calculation for @xmath8sm is done by enclosing in a volume which is 4 times the normal nuclear volume one still has a compact system with a central density and a surface .",
    "one would be tempted to call this a mononuclear system .",
    "the density profile is totally different if the same calculation is done where the confining volume is 8 times the normal volume .",
    "now the density is smeared out almost uniformly in the confining volume which would be the characteristics of a non - interacting gas .",
    "although the densities alter a great deal , the maximum in the specific heat does not change much ( close to 10 mev in both the cases ) but the widths of the specific heat do .",
    "we can study the volume break up by working in the nuclear matter limit .",
    "this is pursued in this work . for a fixed temperature",
    "we do calculations for different densities .",
    "the density where the free energy per particle is minimised is the solution for this temperature ; @xmath2 of this solution is the appropriate @xmath2 for this temperature .",
    "as expected , starting from zero temperature , the system expands .",
    "the minima of free energy drop to lower and lower density as the temperature increases .",
    "but beyond a certain temperature , the minimum in free energy disappears .",
    "the nucleus will now break apart .",
    "this happens just after @xmath11 flattens out as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "this is shown in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "we give some details of the calculation .",
    "we use the mometum dependent mean field of @xcite .",

    "the theta function @xmath15 is replaced by fermi occupation factor ( see details below ) .",
    "the potential felt by a particle is @xmath16+b[\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_0}]^{\\sigma } + 2\\frac{c}{\\rho_0}\\int d^3p'\\frac{f(\\vec r,\\vec p')}{1+[\\frac{\\vec",

    "this gives in nuclear matter binding energy per particle=16 mev , saturation density @xmath23 , compressibility @xmath24=215 mev and @xmath3=.67 at the fermi energy ; @xmath25 gives the correct general behaviour of the real part of the optical potential as a function of incident energy .",
    "a comparison of @xmath25 with that derived from uv14+uvii potential in cold nuclear matter can be found in @xcite .",
    "the specific functional form of the momentum dependent part arises from the fock term of an yukawa potential .",
    "mean fields given by eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) have been widely tested for flow data @xcite and give very good agreement .    to do a finite temperature calculation the following steps have to be executed .",
    "we need to find the occupation probability @xmath26=\\frac{1}{e^{\\beta[\\epsilon(p)-\\mu]}+1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a given temperature @xmath27 and density @xmath28 .",

    ". this self - consistency condition can be fulfilled by an iterative procedure ( details can be found in @xcite ) .    to calculate pressure",

    "( 1 ) and the second term is the contribution from the kinetic energy .",
    "@xmath40dp\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the term @xmath1 is @xmath41 .",
    "the free energy per particle is @xmath42 .",
    "the test @xmath7 when the minimum of free energy is reached provides a sensible test of numerical accuracy .",
    "fig.1 shows a plot of free energy per particle against temperature .",
    "there is no minimum in free energy at 12 mev although at lower temperatures shown in the figure , minima are seen .",
    "the figure therefore suggests that as the system approaches the temperature of 12 mev , it will break up . in fig.2",
    "we show the caloric curve .",
    "the temperature flattens against @xmath2 , momentarily reaches zero slope ( more about the slope in a later section ) and we reach the end of the model . at higher temperatures",
    "there is no minimum in free energy and so to continue a new principle has to be postulated .",
    "if now we use a freeze - out volume then we have reached the more widely used approach for the caloric curve .",
    "we have compared the caloric curve with the one computed with the low enrgy expansion of the fermi - gas model : @xmath43 . as in @xcite , with momentum dependence ,",
    "the caloric curve is initially above the fermi - gas model curve and meets the fermi - gas curve at a later point .",
    "the details of the caloric curve depends upon @xmath3 .",
    "normally one writes @xmath44 .",
    "sobotka et al .",
    "adopt a phenomenolgical expression for @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite . in the momentum dependent calculation done here @xmath45 is in but @xmath46 is not .",
    "further , sobotka et al .",
    "use a finite nucleus of mass 197 but our calculation is for an infinite nucleus . in spite of these differences",
    "there is remarkable similarity between the calculated caloric curves .    in a previous report @xcite the finite temperature mean field theory caloric curve of fig.2 appears but it does not continue after it intersects the fermi - gas model curve .",
    "the temperature interval in that calculation was not small enough and thus missed the flattening of the caloric curve .",
    "sobotka @xcite has pointed out that the inclusion of @xmath46 further lifts @xmath11 at low @xmath2 and flattens it at high @xmath2 .",
    "we now restrict ourselves to just density dependent but momentum independent mean field .",
    "there are two reasons for choosing this : ( a ) calculations are much simpler and ( b ) by comparing with the caloric curve obtained above we will gain an understanding of how momentum dependence modifies the caloric curve .",
    "this means the @xmath19 term in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is put to zero and @xmath47 and @xmath21 are readjusted to give desired values of binding energy per nucleon , equilibrium density and compressibility .",
    "the constants now are @xmath48=-356.8 mev , @xmath18=303.9 mev and @xmath497/6 .",
    "our objective is to obtain the caloric curve but we first look at the well - known @xmath50 diagrams for constant temperature ( isothermals ) and associated liquid - gas co - existence curves .",
    "we discuss this by referring to fig.3 where we have drawn isothermals corresponding to temperatures 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 and 15.64 mev .",
    "the extrema of free energy appear where these isothermals intersect the @xmath51=0 line .",
    "all isothermals will reach @xmath51=0 at the uninteresting @xmath28=0 limit but the lower temperature isothermals intersect the @xmath51=0 line also at two other values of @xmath28 . of these",
    ", the higher value of @xmath28 correspond to the minimum of free energy ( this is the one that has concerned us above ) and the lower value of @xmath28 corresponds to a maximum of free energy and is of no consequence to us in this section but will become very relevant in the next section when we consider constant energy ( rather than constant temperature ) solutions .",
    "we have also drawn the co - existence line following the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "the high density side of the co - existence line is of interest here .",
    "the co - existence line encloses the @xmath51=0 line ( if not , the maxwell construction would lead to contradiction ) .",
    "however , at low temperatures the value of the density where the co - existence line intersects an isothermal is very close to the value of the density where the isothermal intersects the @xmath51=0 line .",
    "for example , the value of the density where the co - existence line intersects the @xmath11=6 mev line is 0.148 @xmath52 .",
    "the value of the density where this isothermal cuts the @xmath51=0 line is very close but marginally less . at @xmath11=12",
    "mev the density at which the isothermal intersects the co - existence line is 0.111 @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath51=0 line intersects this isothermal at a density which is only 0.011 @xmath52 less .",
    "this means that with the usual interpretation when the system has reached @xmath51=0 it is already in a mixed phase but only a tiny fraction is in the gas phase .",
    "the caloric curve in finite temperature simplified mean field model ( neglect of momentum dependence ) is shown in fig.4 .",
    "this curve is below the curve obtained with simple fermi - gas approximation .",
    "comparison with fig.2 shows the effect of momentum dependence . here",
    "also the system expands with temperature .",
    "there is no minimum in free energy beyond temperature @xmath10 12.2 mev .",
    "thus the caloric curve disappears afterwards unless a different prescription is given for choosing an appropriate density .",
    "before the caloric curve disappears the slope of @xmath11 will reach zero which can be seen from the arguments given in the next section .",
    "we will now consider constant energy rather than constant temperature solutions .",
    "we use the density dependent but momentum independent interaction of section iv .",
    "we pick a @xmath2=excitation energy per particle . at a given density",
    "we guess a temperature and calculate what @xmath2 it generates with equilibrium fermi occupation factors .",
    "the temperature is then varied till the correct @xmath2 is obtained .",
    "next we pick another density and again vary the temperature to obtain the prescribed @xmath2 . now",
    "a different temperature will be obtained .",
    "the reader will notice that we are neglecting the fluctuation of @xmath53 obtained from the grand canonical calculation .",
    "since this is an infinite matter calculation , this is justified . at each density",
    "we also calculate entropy per particle @xmath54 and the equilibrium density is chosen from the condition @xmath55 ( and the second derivative is positive ) . at this density",
    "the temperature can be can be defined by @xmath56 .",
    "( this definition gives no difference from the temperature used in the grand canonical calculation ) .",
    "the pressure is defined by @xmath57 .",
    "thus the caloric curve can be traced out and the pressure checked . at the density",
    "where the entropy maximises , the pressure goes to zero . for calculation of entropy",
    "one can follow the method described in @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the number of particles ( taken to be arbitrarily large ) . because of pauli principle",
    ", @xmath62 is very difficult to calculate directly .",
    "however it can be obtained from laplace inverse of the grand partition function ( which respects the pauli principle ) in the saddle - point approximation .",
    "this leads to @xmath63 here @xmath11 is the temperature and @xmath64 the chemical potential which give the prescribed @xmath53 and @xmath28 when evaluated in the grand canonical ensemble . in eq .",
    "( 10 ) , we have neglected a pre - factor as we only need @xmath59 and in the large @xmath61 limit the pre - factor gives zero contribution .",
    "we mention here that instead of eq.(10 ) one can also use the more well - known formula for entropy : @xmath65\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] both give the same result . similarly instead of the microcanonical expression for pressure one can use the the grand canonical expression for pressure ( i.e. , eq.7 with @xmath19 of eq.1 set to 0 ) .",
    "the @xmath50 curves for constant @xmath2 are shown in fig.5 .",
    "compared to the isothermal @xmath50 curves , there are two huge differences .",
    "one is that for @xmath2 below 16 mev ( which is the binding energy per particle at saturation density in mean field theory ) the constant energy @xmath50 curves terminate in the low density side .",
    "this is when the stretching energy per particle equals @xmath2 .",
    "the other difference is that below @xmath2=16 mev , these curves intersect the @xmath51=0 line at only one point .",
    "the isothermal @xmath50 diagrams ( fig.3 ) intersect the @xmath51=0 line at two points ( we are ignoring the uninteresting case of @xmath28=0 ) .",
    "all the zeroes of @xmath51 in fig.3 must also appear in fig.5 .",
    "how do they map ? the zeroes of pressure in fig.5 are all maxima in @xmath54 if one moves along the constant energy contour but not all of them correspond to minima of @xmath66 if one moves along the constant temperature contour .    for our specific case , the zeroes of pressure at @xmath2=6 , 8 , 10 and 12 mev ( fig .",
    "5 ) correspond to minima of free energy @xmath66 ( fig.3 ) .",
    "the zeroes of pressure for @xmath2=14 and 15 mev ( fig.5 ) correspond to maxima of @xmath66 .",
    "thus all the minima in @xmath66 of fig.3 are bunched into zeroes of @xmath51 below @xmath67=13.6 mev and all the maxima of @xmath66 in fig.3 are bunched into zeroes of @xmath51 with @xmath6713.6 to 16 mev .",
    "it then follows that in the caloric curve @xmath11 increases with @xmath2 and must flatten out ( this is the end of the curve in the constant temperature model ) . in the constant energy model",
    ", it will continue beyond finally terminating at @xmath2=16 mev .",
    "but when the caloric curve extends beyond the finite temperature model , the slope of @xmath11 against @xmath2 must be negative .",
    "this is a physically unreasonable result since in the grand canonical calculation we are dealing with an arbitrarily large system .",
    "this reflects the inadequacy of the mean field model . indeed in terms of fig.3",
    "we are in the negative compressibility zone .",
    "we note in passing that negative specific heat also appears in the figures of @xcite .",
    "this is due to inadequacy of the model employed @xcite .",
    "the variational principle model for the nuclear caloric curve is also capable of producing a maximum in the specific heat .",
    "this maximum is gently approached as opposed to that in the thermodynamic model where it is a very sharp peak @xcite in the nuclear matter limit .",
    "the model likely has validity for proton induced reactions as opposed to central collisions of heavy ions . to be of greater use",
    "one needs to extend the model to higher energy .",
    "it is not clear how this is to be done .",
    "we also notice that the interesting part of the caloric curve is at a rather high value of temperature ( and excitation energy ) compared to what we encounter in experiments .",
    "this may be a shortcoming of the mean field model or the infinite matter limit or both .",
