    "the discovery of the acceleration of the universe @xcite , @xcite resulted in the breaking of the link between geometry and destiny of the universe .",
    "it was now the nature of the substance driving this acceleration that would determine the ultimate fate of the universe .",
    "current observations are consistent with a cosmological constant as the origin of this acceleration , but they are not yet able to rule out other possibilities such as phantom energy which will drive the universe towards a ` big rip ' singularity .",
    "this situation has encouraged the study of other exotic singularities .",
    "one such example is the sudden future singularity ( sfs ) ( type ii according to the classification in @xcite ) , first proposed by @xcite .",
    "other exotic singularities discovered to date include the finite scale factor ( fsf ) singularity ( type iii @xcite ) , the generalised sudden future singularity ( gsfs ) @xcite , the big separation ( type iv @xcite ) and the @xmath0-singularity @xcite .",
    "these singularities may serve as alternatives to dark energy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the big brake is a special kind of a singularity of the sfs type , which can arise in tachyonic models @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the results of our investigation of one example class of models which accommodate an sfs , also proposed by barrow , by confronting it with the current cosmological observations .",
    "the present work is not the first time that the sfs models have been confronted with cosmological observations .",
    "previously , @xcite performed such a test using the luminosity distance redshift relation applied to supernovae data .",
    "their paper showed that these data were consistent with the sfs model over the redshift range probed by the supernovae , and moreover could permit an sfs that would occur in a suprisingly short time : less than 10 million years from now . in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis to confront this class of sfs models with some other available cosmological observations and constraints , from the cosmic microwave background radiation , baryon acoustic oscillations and the age of the universe .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce some relevant theory underlying sudden future singularity models .",
    "section 3 gives an account of the cosmological probes we have used to constrain our sfs model , followed by an explanation of the methods we employed to perform these tests . in section 4 we present the results of our investigations .",
    "finally in section 5 we give our conclusions .",
    "in 2004 @xcite first published the results of his discovery of the existence of sudden future singularities , which arise in the expanding phase of a standard friedmann universe and violate the dominant energy condition only .",
    "this was an intriguing discovery since until then the theoretical search for expanding universes with possible violent ends had identified only big rip singularities which violate all the energy conditions @xcite .",
    "consider the friedmann equations : @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the energy density , @xmath4 the pressure , @xmath5 the scale factor , @xmath6 the curvature index , @xmath7 the speed of light , @xmath8 the gravitational constant and an overdot represents derivative with respect to time .",
    "barrow found that by keeping the scale factor and the hubble expansion rate finite one will also necessarily maintain a finite density , but that the pressure can still diverge .",
    "the divergence of pressure is accompanied by the blow up of the acceleration , leading to a scalar polynomial curvature singularity @xcite . shortly after their discovery",
    ", @xcite showed that these singularities may be avoided ( or moderated ) when quantum effects are taken into account .",
    "the finiteness of the energy density and the fact that @xmath9 at an sfs means that the null ( @xmath10 ) , weak ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , strong ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) energy conditions are satisfied but the dominant energy condition ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) is violated .",
    "we can see that the divergent behaviour of the pressure can not be linked to the finite energy density or we will not have an sfs .",
    "hence we need to release the assumption of an equation of state which imposes a link between these two quantities .",
    "it should be noted that an sfs can occur also in inhomogeneous and anisotropic models @xcite , @xcite .",
    "similar to sudden singularities are the so called ` quiescent ' singularities which occur in braneworld models @xcite .",
    "these are a type of sudden singularities whereby the pressure remains finite alongside the density and the hubble parameter while higher derivatives of the scale factor diverge .",
    "@xcite confronted braneworld models with quiescent singularities with sne ia and bao data and concluded that they would not fit observations .",
    "furthermore the exact same sudden future singularity with the divergent pressure occurs in nonlocal cosmology as found by @xcite .",
    "the accelerating universe in this model will lead it towards an sfs rather than a de sitter type epoch .",
    "koivisto however shows that these singularities may be avoided by a slight modification of the nonlocal model .",
    "physically sudden future singularities manifest themselves as momentarily infinite peaks of tidal forces , but geodesic completeness is satisfied in our sfs model .",
    "hence sudden future singularities are regarded as weak singularities @xcite which means in - falling observers or detectors would not be destroyed by tidal forces @xcite .",
    "the universe will continue its expanding evolution beyond such weak singularities until for example the occurrence of a more serious singularity that is geodesically incomplete like the big rip which can end the universe @xcite .",
    "barrow constructs an example sfs model where the scale factor takes the form :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are free constants to be determined . by fixing the zero of time , i.e. setting a(0 ) = 0 , and the time of the singularity , @xmath23",
    ", the scale factor may be written in the equivalent form :    @xmath24    @xcite changed the original parametrisation for the scale factor by using @xmath25 , to obtain : @xmath26 \\hspace{0.5cm},\\hspace{0.5cm}y=\\frac{t}{t_s},\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constants to be determined .",
    "this way they created a non - standardicity parameter , @xmath30 , which , as it tends to zero , recovers the standard friedmann limit ( i.e. a model without an sfs ) .    for a pressure derivative singularity to occur we need : @xmath32 we note that , for @xmath33 , all energy conditions are fulfilled .",
    "these singularities are called generalised sudden future singularities ( gsfs ) @xcite and may occur in theories with higher - order curvature corrections @xcite . for an sfs",
    "we need @xmath34 which means that @xmath35 .",
    "an important requirement is that the asymptotic behaviour of the scale factor close to the big bang singularity follows a simple power law @xmath36 which will simulate the behaviour of flat @xmath37 barotropic fluid models with @xmath38 .",
    "this will ensure that all the standard observed characteristics of the early universe such as the cmb , density perturbations and big bang nucleosynthesis are preserved .",
    "all the energy conditions are satisfied if we require @xmath29 to lie in the range    @xmath39    furthermore , in accordance with ( 7 ) , if for a standard dust - dominated universe we take @xmath40 our sfs model will reduce to the einstein - de - sitter ( eds ) universe at early times .",
    "the other parameters of the model that we should consider are : @xmath27 , @xmath31 and @xmath30 .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 , which sets the physical size of the universe at the time of the sfs , will cancel out in the equations of the standard cosmological probes we have used to test the model .",
    "thus we do not need to consider this parameter further .    for constraining the time , @xmath31 , when an sfs might occur",
    ", we can introduce the dimensionless parameter @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the current age of the universe .",
    "since the singularity is assumed to be in the future , it follows that @xmath43 .    the current acceleration obtained in the sfs model , as a result of the particular form adopted for the scale factor , leads to a divergence of the pressure at sometime in the future evolution of the model .",
    "@xcite refer to the cause of this late time acceleration in the sfs model as a ` pressure - driven dark energy ' .    with the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath44 having definite values or ranges",
    ", it remained to identify a suitable range of investigation for the non - standardicity parameter @xmath30 . in @xcite",
    "negative values of @xmath30 were associated with acceleration , but we revisited this question in order to check rigorously the range of values of @xmath30 which should be considered , taking into account all relevant physical constraints . in",
    "so doing we imposed the established observational facts that both the first and second derivatives of the scale factor are currently positive ",
    "i.e. we rejected any combination of sfs model parameters for which @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "in addition we imposed the physical condition that positive and negative redshifts should correspond to past and future events respectively .",
    "finally we checked the sign of @xmath47 throughout the evolution of the sfs model and rejected parameter combinations that would predict contraction ( i.e. @xmath48 ) at any point in the interval @xmath49 , on the ( conservative ) grounds that the expansion of the universe is securely observed from e.g. the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae over this range of redshifts .",
    "we did not , however , make any further assumptions about the expansion history of the universe outside of this range ; in particular parameter combinations that would predict e.g. future contraction of the universe were not excluded from our analysis .",
    "thus by fixing @xmath50 , as previously discussed , and varying @xmath28 and @xmath44 over their permitted ranges , we sought to identify those values of @xmath30 which were consistent with the above physical constraints .",
    "it quickly became apparent that this task was not possible analytically .",
    "therefore we carried out a numerical exploration of the 3-dimensional parameter space @xmath51 .",
    "this then told us that @xmath30 should not be positive .",
    "we carried out a comparison between our sfs model and current cosmological observations within a bayesian framework , computing posterior distributions for the sfs model parameters inferred from each of the cosmological probes considered . from bayes theorem",
    "we may write    @xmath52    where @xmath53 denotes the parameter(s ) of the sfs model and ` data ' denotes generically the observed data for one of the cosmological probes under consideration .",

    "the first term on the right hand side is the likelihood function which gives the probability of obtaining the data that we actually observed , given a particular set of model parameters .",
    "the second term on the right hand side is the prior probability distribution for the model parameters , based on e.g. theoretical considerations and/or previous observations . for each of our cosmological probes we took the likelihood function to be gaussian in form , i.e.    @xmath54    where the constant of proportionality could be determined from the normalisation conditions that the likelihood function and posterior probability distribution should integrate to unity . in eq .",
    "( 9 ) the quantity @xmath55 takes the general form :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the observed value of the relevant cosmological probe , @xmath58 is the value predicted by our sfs model given the parameters @xmath53 , @xmath59 is the uncertainty ( due to measurement error and/or intrinsic variations ) in the observed value and @xmath28 is the number of data points associated with it .",
    "we now briefly describe each cosmological probe in more detail .",
    "we calculated the redshift - magnitude relation for our model to compare it with the observed relation as probed by sne ia as standard candles .",
    "although as mentioned in the previous section an sfs could occur regardless of the curvature of the universe , to make our calculations simpler , and also to be consistent with the present observational data , we shall consider only a flat universe which bears an sfs .",
    "we used 557 sne from the union2 dataset as compiled by @xcite which is the largest published sne ia sample to date . in our analysis",
    "we treated the hubble constant as a nuisance parameter , marginalising over a range of values using as a prior distribution the most recent results from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) key project @xcite , which assume no underlying cosmology in measuring this parameter .",
    "we describe this marginalisation process in more detail below . for our sne ia",

    "we take @xmath63 to be 0.15 as advocated by @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the distance modulus as a function of redshift for the sfs model and the concordance model for their respective best - fitting parameters and how they compare with the best sne dataset available .",

    "( these are the best - fitting sfs parameters for the union2 sne dataset ) .",
    "the concordance model prediction is shown as the dashed pink line and is for parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67 ( from the wmap7 results @xcite ) .",

    "the positions of the peaks and troughs of the cmb power spectrum , which can be measured precisely , provide a measure of the distance to the decoupling epoch .",
    "the distance ratios measured by the cmb are : + ( 1 ) the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface ( at redshift @xmath72 , which we take to be 1089 ) , @xmath73 , divided by the sound horizon size at the decoupling epoch , @xmath74 which is quantified by the ` _ _ acoustic scale _ _ ' and is defined by : @xmath75 where the factor @xmath76 accounts for the fact that @xmath73 is the proper angular diameter distance and we calculate @xmath74 following @xcite . + ( 2 ) the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface divided by the hubble horizon size at the decoupling epoch , which is called the ` _ _ shift parameter _ _ ' , @xmath70 and is given by @xcite : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the matter density parameter .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that using these two parameters together is necessary in order to place tight cmb constraints on the parameters of the model of interest .",
    "they found that models with the same parameter @xmath70 but different values for @xmath71 , and vice versa , in general gave different cmb angular power spectra .    for the cmb constraints we therefore computed likelihoods with the following @xmath55 expressions for the shift parameter and the acoustic scale respectively :    @xmath79    @xmath80    the observed values for these quantities : @xmath81 and @xmath82 , are obtained from the wmap7 data and given by @xcite",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite the shift parameter is not a directly measurable quantity and it is in fact derived from the cmb data assuming a specific cosmological model .",
    "care therefore needs to be taken when using this quantity as a cosmological constraint .",
    "the value for the shift parameter quoted above , as @xcite explains , has been derived assuming a standard flrw universe with matter , radiation , curvature and dark energy components .",
    "the sfs model we are considering is also a standard friedmann model but it assumes no explicit dark energy component ; instead cosmic acceleration is driven by the divergence of pressure resulting from the particular form of scale factor adopted in the model .",
    "matter is also permitted in the sfs and in fact , since we require our model to reduce to the eds case at early times , we adopt the same matter content as that in the concordance model . concerning the radiation and curvature components , we follow @xcite and ignore these in the shift parameter calculation .",
    "turning to the dark energy component , here we followed the approach of @xcite and expressed our sfs model in a form equivalent to an evolving dark energy model by computing its effective equation of state , @xmath83 .",
    "( see the appendix for a short derivation of the expression for @xmath84 ) .",
    "we then looked at the evolution of this effective @xmath0 index to see how it compared with the observed behaviour .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the evolution of the effective equation of state over the redshift range @xmath85 , for two representative sets of sfs model parameters . in both cases",
    "we see the the same general features : @xmath86 as @xmath87 and @xmath88 for large @xmath89 .",
    "these limiting behaviours are in good agreement with current observations .",
    "note , however , that in plot ( b ) the particular sfs model parameters result in the divergence of @xmath84 at certain redshifts , which is caused by the denominator in the expression on the right hand side of eq .",
    "a.5 tending to zero at these redshifts . this behaviour is discussed in @xcite where they make the case that in models where dark energy is not treated as an explicit fluid or a field , the equation of state can not be used as a fundamental quantity and indeed an effective equation of state may display unusual properties like singularities .",
    "very similar divergent behaviour was found e.g. by @xcite in computing an effective equation of state for their evolving @xmath90 model ; indeed those authors refer explicitly to each divergent feature as a ` fake singularity , which is nothing but an artefact of the eos parametrisation ' . in our case too the divergence of @xmath84 is not seen as an indication of a fundamental physical problem with the model .",
    "nevertheless the general similarity of the limiting behaviour of @xmath84 to that of the concordance model gives us confidence , following @xcite , that it remains appropriate to use the ` observed ' value of the shift parameter when investigating our sfs model .     as a function of redshift in the sfs model , for two representative sets of model parameters .",

    "the current value of the hubble constant is the final constraint which we employed in our analysis .",
    "although the hubble constant already features indirectly in the sne ia and age constraints , since it enters into our calculations of the predicted values for those two probes , we considered it useful also to compare directly the observed value of @xmath108 with its predicted value calculated for our sfs model .",
    "the latter is simply given by :    @xmath109    we thus computed a likelihood function for this constraint using the @xmath55 quantity    @xmath110    where @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 , i.e. the ( cosmology - independent ) hst key project value discussed earlier .",
    "in this section we present posterior distributions for our sfs model parameters inferred from each of the cosmological probes described in section 3 . for ease of presentation",

    "we adopted uniform priors for @xmath28 and @xmath44 over the intervals @xmath114 and @xmath115 respectively , on the theoretical grounds discussed in section 2 .",

    "in this paper we have investigated one class of sudden future singularity models proposed by barrow , by confronting it with the currently available observational data . after introducing the theory behind the model and explaining its characteristics in section 1 , we reported on the cosmological probes we used in testing our model in section 2 , taking care throughout to consider thoroughly the applicability of each probe to the sfs model under study .",
    "we then presented the results of our investigations in section 4 .",
    "specifically we found that the sfs model was not compatible with all of the current cosmological observations considered : while good agreement could be found with e.g. the union2 sne data and bao distance parameter at low redshift , the same model parameters predicted an acoustic scale and a shift parameter for the cmb which were in strong disagreement with wmap7 observations .    we have presented our results as a series of conditional ` slices ' through the @xmath119 parameter space at fixed values of @xmath30 .",
    "we note that the rejection of the sfs model does _ not _ depend on our choice of 2-dimensional parameter space on which to conduct our analysis .",
    "the choice of the @xmath119 space was convenient because of the ranges of these two parameters , but the absence of any region which gave a fit to the model is a robust result that can be extended to the full 3-dimensional space of ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "in other words , by showing that there is no fit to the data in conditional 2-dimensional spaces we have therefore shown that there is no fit to the data in the full 3-dimensional parameter space .",
    "in conclusion we note that our results are for a fixed value of @xmath50 , which ensures that our sfs model reduces to the eds universe at early times . in a forthcoming paper ( dabrowski , denkiewicz , ghodsi & hendry in preparation )",
    "we will relax this assumption and consider sfs models in which the parameter @xmath29 is allowed to vary , by confronting these models with the same cosmological observations which we have considered here .",
