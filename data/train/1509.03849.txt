    "investigations of two - dimensional systems ( 2dss ) on si surfaces began with metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors ( mosfets ) @xcite .",
    "however , the amorphous sio@xmath10/si interface severely limits the quality of the 2dss .",
    "the development @xcite of hydrogen - terminated silicon ( 111 ) [ h - si(111 ) ] vacuum field effect transistors ( fets ) is based on a simple but extraordinary fact : a wet chemical treatment of a si(111 ) surface with an ammonium fluoride ( nh@xmath11f ) solution can produce an ideal h - passivated si surface , which is both atomically flat and possesses a very low surface state density ( @xmath12 @xmath2 ) @xcite , leading to much higher carrier mobilities . in recent years , both a high quality two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) with electron mobility of 325,000 @xmath13/vs @xcite and a high quality two - dimensional hole system ( 2dhs ) with hole mobility of 10,000 @xmath13/vs @xcite",
    "have been realized in this system .",
    "they are comparable to the best si / sige heterostructures @xcite , which are limited to the ( 100 ) oriented surfaces because of much higher threading dislocation densities on the other surface orientations @xcite .    in this work we have fabricated ambipolar hexagonal devices , which can switch between a 2des and a 2dhs in the same device by changing a gate voltage . compared to other ambipolar devices @xcite , the 2des on the si(111 ) surface has a sixfold valley degeneracy , while the valley degeneracy of holes is one .",
    "the ambipolar devices provide a direct comparison between electrons and holes with very different valley degeneracies in the same conduction channel , which allows a new perspective to the fundamental research , such as the properties of 2d metals @xcite .",
    "in addition , the hexagonal devices enable the exploration of the sixfold valley - degenerate electron system .    in the h - si(111 )",
    "vacuum fet device , a global si / sio@xmath10 gate piece is used to induce a 2ds , which is further confined into a well - defined 2d region by pn junction isolation and trench isolation .",
    "similarly , future nanoelectronic devices , like quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) and quantum dots ( qds ) , may be realized on the si(111 ) surfaces using the in - plane depleting gates based on pn junctions .",
    "moreover , because of the sixfold valley degeneracy of the 2des , the valley degree of freedom can provide extra resources for practical applications in the same way as spintronic devices utilize the spin degree of freedom . this will open up new opportunities for another class of devices  valleytronic devices @xcite .",

    "( a ) schematic cross section of an ambipolar vacuum fet ( not to scale ) , with a sio@xmath10/si(100 ) remote gate piece and a h - si(111 ) piece contact bonded in a vacuum .",
    "the remote gate piece is used to induce 2d carriers on the h - si(111 ) surface by applying a gate voltage on a p@xmath0 gate layer through an encapsulated vacuum cavity .",
    "it also has a fully covered sio@xmath10 layer with a thin layer of sio@xmath10 ( @xmath14 30 nm ) left in the cavity .",

    "two different configurations are investigated .",
    "( c ) one has trench isolation , and ( d ) the other does nt have trench isolation .",
    "the dash lines in ( c ) show the cross section depicted in ( a ) . ]",
    "the vacuum fet device is fabricated from two pieces .",
    "one is a sio@xmath10/si(100 ) remote gate piece , and the other is a h - terminated high purity si(111 ) piece , as shown in fig.[fig : schematics](a ) . just like a mosfet",
    ", when a positive ( negative ) gate voltage is applied between the remote gate and a n@xmath0 ( p@xmath0 ) source ohmic contact through an encapsulated vacuum cavity , a 2des ( 2dhs ) will be induced on the h - si(111 ) surface .",
    "since the 2des has a sixfold valley degeneracy [ fig.[fig : schematics](b ) ] , the hexagonal device is designed to investigate its underlying symmetry , with six n@xmath0 ohmic contacts placed along the major axes of the constant energy ellipses on the si(111 ) surface , labeled as 2,4,@xmath15 , 12 .",
    "it also has six p@xmath0 ohmic contacts placed between the n@xmath0 contacts , labeled as 1,3,@xmath16,11 .",
    "the remote gate piece with a hexagonal cavity [ fig .  [ fig : realdevice ] ( b ) ] is contact bonded on the h - si(111 ) piece in a vacuum chamber .",
    "when a positive ( negative ) gate voltage is applied , the n@xmath0 ( p@xmath0 ) ohmic contacts are used to access the 2des ( 2dhs ) at the center , and the p@xmath0 ( n@xmath0 ) contacts act as lateral confinement . figure [ fig : schematics ] ( b)-(d ) show the arrangement of the n@xmath0 and p@xmath0 ohmic contacts relative to crystallographic directions .",
    "two different types of devices are investigated .",
    "one has shallow trench isolation ( sti ) to confine the center 2ds [ the center blue hexagon in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematics](c ) ] ; the other does nt have the sti , and the center 2ds is defined by the hexagonal cavity [ fig .",
    "[ fig : schematics](d ) ]",
    ". there is typically a @xmath14 100 @xmath17 m misalignment between the remote gate piece and the h - si(111 ) piece when they are contact bonded . because the distance between the trenches and the edges of the hexagonal cavity is more than 200 @xmath17 m , and the trenches",
    "are etched on the si(111 ) piece , the misalignment does nt change the center 2ds in the device with the sti ; the misalignment can affect the center 2ds in the device without the sti when the n@xmath0 and p@xmath0 contacts are not concentric and aligned to the hexagonal cavity .",
    "however , the measurement results show that there is no significant difference between these two types of devices , because the relative placement of the contacts is fixed , and the bonding alignment is not critical in defining the device with the edges of the cavity far outside the contact perimeters .",
    "we have fabricated six devices ( 194 - 199 ) with peak electron mobilities of @xmath7 @xmath5/vs , @xmath18 @xmath5/vs , @xmath19 @xmath5/vs , @xmath20 @xmath5/vs , @xmath4 @xmath5/vs and @xmath21 @xmath5/vs at 300 mk respectively , in which four ( 194 - 197 ) of them have the sti , and the other two ( 198,199 ) do not have it .",

    "first , a p@xmath0 gate conducting layer is formed by ion implantation with @xmath23 @xmath2 , 15 kev boron ions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematics](a ) .",
    "then a 2 @xmath17 m deep si mesa is dry etched around the edges of each die using reactive ion etching ( rie ) .",
    "next , a @xmath14 350 nm thick sio@xmath10 layer is thermally grown on the top : dry oxidation at 1050 @xmath24c for 15 min , followed by wet oxidation at 1050 @xmath24c for 27 min and another dry oxidation at 1050 @xmath24c for 10 min .",
    "the dry - wet - dry cycle is used to improve the gate oxide quality , and also activates the implanted dopants .",
    "after that , a cavity with a @xmath14 30 nm thick oxide layer left behind is formed by dry etching and wet etching . in order to make sure",
    "the oxide thickness is reduced to @xmath14 30 nm in the cavity , a test wafer and the device wafer are loaded into a rie machine and dry etched at the same time .",
    "both have the same @xmath14 350 nm thick oxide layer , and the oxide layer is dry etched by @xmath14 270 nm .",
    "then the depth of the cavity in the test wafer is measured using a profilometer after removing photoresist .",
    "the time of the wet etching to leave the @xmath14 30 nm thick oxide layer is calculated based on the oxide thickness , the depth of the cavity and the wet etching rate .",
    "the fully sio@xmath10 encapsulated gate piece with the oxide reduced cavity drastically reduces the likelihood of gate leakage , compared to the gate piece where the doped regions were exposed .",
    "we have tested remote gate pieces with either @xmath14 350 nm or @xmath14 200 nm thick thermal oxide , and both of them work well .",

    "first , a 30 nm thick sacrificial sio@xmath10 layer is thermally grown on the top of the si(111 ) substrate by dry oxidation at 950 @xmath24c for 30 min in a cmos grade furnace to reduce the channeling effect during ion implantation and protect the clean si(111 ) surface .",
    "next , the six n@xmath0 contact regions are patterned by photolithography with the primary flat of the si(111 ) wafer ( oriented to [ @xmath29 ) aligned ( @xmath30 ) along the long side of the dies .",
    "then the wafer is ion implanted with @xmath31 @xmath2 phosphorus ions at 50 kev .",
    "alignment marks are formed at the same time .",
    "similarly , the six p@xmath0 contact regions are defined by photolithography and ion implantation with @xmath32@xmath2 boron ions at an energy of 15 kev .",
    "the ion implantation parameters are based on previous works @xcite and simulation results from suprem - iv process simulator .",
    "the parameters are selected so that after thermal annealing , the peak doping concentration is located near the si(111 ) surface , and about one order of magnitude higher than that of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) metal - insulate transition ( mit ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dopingprofile ] .",
    "( the 3d mit occurs at doping concentration of @xmath33 @xmath34 for phosphorus @xcite and @xmath35 @xmath34 for boron @xcite . ) after each ion implantation , the photoresist is removed by acetone cleaning and piranha cleaning .",
    "first the wafer is immersed in boiling acetone for 30 min to remove most of the photoresist .",
    "then the wafer is rinsed with isopropyl alcohol ( ipa ) and de - ionized ( di ) water .",
    "next , the wafer is immersed in a piranha solution ( 4 h@xmath10so@xmath11(98@xmath36 ) : 1 h@xmath100@xmath10 ( 30@xmath36 ) ) at 100 @xmath24c for 30 min to remove the residual photoresist .",
    "right before rapid thermal annealing ( rta ) , the wafer is rca-1 cleaned for 5 min with a h@xmath10o@xmath10/nh@xmath11oh / h@xmath10o solution , then thoroughly rinsed in di water , and spin - dried .",
    "the wafer is annealed in a cmos grade rapid thermal annealer at 950 @xmath24c for 60 sec .",
    "alignment marks from ion implantations are visible before the rta process , but invisible after it .",
    "rca-1 clean etches the ion implanted sio@xmath10 regions before the rta process .",
    "they serve as alignment marks to do mesa etching , but the contrast is very low .",
    "it is helpful to define global alignment marks before the rta process using cmos compatible processes .",
    "next , if sti is desired , the 200 nm deep and 10 @xmath17 m wide shallow trenches are formed by dry etching . after that , a 2 @xmath17 m deep si mesa is dry etched around the edges of each die .",
    "this mesa prevents particles from accumulating on the surface while handling the substrate and ensures a clean edge for bonding @xcite .",
    "it also defines each die for dicing .",
    "finally , the wafer is diced into individual si(111 ) pieces , as shown in fig.[fig : realdevice](a ) .      after standard cleaning ( acetone cleaning , ipa rinse , di water rinse , piranha cleaning , and di water rinse ) in clean room , one si(111 ) piece and one si / sio@xmath10 remote gate piece are transferred into an oxygen - free glove box with a typical o@xmath10 concentration of 2 ppm .",
    "the si(111 ) piece is put in a diluted solution of hf / h@xmath10o ( 1:20 ) for 2 min to remove the sacrificial sio@xmath10 layer , and then immersed in a 40@xmath36 nh@xmath11f solution for 10 min to create an atomically flat h - passivated si(111 ) surface , with di water rinse after each step .",
    "it is crucial that each of these solutions is oxygen - free to ensure the high quality of the final device @xcite .",
    "usually they are deoxygenated with a constant agitation from a magnetic stir rod for 72 hours in the glove box .",
    "finally , these two pieces are transferred into a vacuum chamber , and pushed against a sapphire boss to apply a pressure between them , sufficient to initiate bonding through van der waals forces .",
    "the bonded device is loosely placed in a customized holder machined from polyimide material , which is designed to facilitate handling of the device without applying stress .",
    "it is wired in a nitrogen glove box by hand soldering using indium at 320 @xmath24c and installed on a standard 8-pin dual in - line package ( dip ) header , which is compatible with sample holders at the national high magnetic field laboratory ( nhmfl ) .",
    "if only the 2des is to be investigated , eight contacts are sufficient , including two gate contacts and six ohmic contacts to the 2des .",
    "there are 12 wires in our cryostat . in order to measure both the 2des and the 2dhs ,",
    "the 8 pin dip header is inserted into another 20 pin dip header , and four ohmic contacts to the 2dhs are directly wired to the 20 pin dip header .",

    "figure [ fig : afm ] shows that the si(111 ) surface is clean with atomic steps .",
    "typically the doped contacts on the si(111 ) surface are at different elevations from the undoped si(111 ) surface after wet chemical cleaning and passivation . specifically , n@xmath0 ohmic contacts ( phosphorus doped ) are @xmath14 1 nm below the undoped region , as shown in fig .",

    "<S> we have fabricated ambipolar transistors on chemically prepared hydrogen - terminated si(111 ) surfaces , in which a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) or a two - dimensional hole system ( 2dhs ) can be populated in the same conduction channel by changing the gate voltage of a global gate applied through a vacuum gap . depending on the gate bias , ion implanted n@xmath0 and p@xmath0 regions function either as ohmic contacts or as in - plane gates , which laterally confine the carriers induced by the global gate . on one device , electron and hole densities of up to @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xmath2 respectively are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the peak electron mobility is @xmath4 @xmath5/vs , and the peak hole mobility is @xmath6 @xmath5/vs at 300 mk ; the ratio of about 20 is mainly due to the very different valley degeneracies ( 6:1 ) of electrons and holes on the si(111 ) surface . on another device </S>",
    "<S> , the peak electron mobility of @xmath7 @xmath5/vs is reached at 300 mk . </S>",
    "<S> these devices are hexagonal in order to investigate the underlying symmetry of the 2dess , which have a sixfold valley degeneracy at zero magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> three magnetoresistance measurements with threefold rotational symmetry are used to determine the symmetry of the 2dess at different magnetic field . at filling factor @xmath8 , </S>",
    "<S> the observed anisotropy can be explained by a single valley pair occupancy of composite fermions ( cfs ) . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively the cfs preserve the valley anisotropy , in addition to the twofold valley degeneracy . at magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> up to 35 t , the 2/3 fractional quantum hall state is observed with a well developed hall plateau ; at @xmath9 , the three magnetoresistances show a large anisotropy ( 50:1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that device degradation is not a serious issue for our measurements , if the device is kept in vacuum or a nitrogen gas environment and its time in air is minimized . </S>"
