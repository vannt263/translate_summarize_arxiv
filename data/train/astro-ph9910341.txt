    "( @xcite ) and assuming an on - state eclipse duration of 5.5  hour are indicated .",
    "a number of new and interesting features are evident .",
    "soon after the start of the main - on state observation there is an interval of dipping activity ( the modulation is much stronger in the lecs than the mecs , consistent with the known energy dependence of dipping ) , followed by a dip - free interval and a longer interval of deep dipping at the end of the observation .",
    "the short - on state observation covers parts of 4 orbital cycles and includes 3 eclipse intervals .",
    "both the lecs and the mecs show a gradual reduction in count rate , with this effect being more pronounced in the lecs , such that the fourth orbital cycle appears to be absent , whereas a small modulation is still visible in the mecs .",
    "superposed on this decay are the eclipses and what is normally taken to be dipping activity",
    ". however , this appears to be present for up to 20  hrs during each orbital cycle , whereas the main - on state dip duration is usually 510  hr ( see e.g. , reynolds & parmar @xcite ; scott & leahy @xcite ) . during the first three orbital cycles , the centroid of the emission occurs at successively earlier orbital phases , while for the fourth orbital cycle no strong variation within the cycle is observed .",
    "this is also seen in the hardness ratio plot which shows intervals of increased hardness ( consistent with increased absorption ) that occur progressively earlier in each of the first 3 ( and possibly the fourth ) orbital cycles .",
    "the peaks of the mecs centroids and the increases in lecs hardness ratio seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] are separated by an average of @xmath31.4  days .",
    "this means that the intervals of strong absorption march back by @xmath37  hr each orbital cycle .",
    "this rapid marching back is in strong contrast to the main - on state dips which have a period only 0.5  hr less than the orbital one ( scott & leahy @xcite ) .",
    "there may also be a narrow intensity dip in the mecs lightcurve , similar to those seen in the on - state , towards the end of the second cycle of the short - on state .",

    "the asca solid - state imaging spectrometer ( sis ) results of mihara & soong ( @xcite ) indicate that the @xmath31  kev feature may be better modeled as two narrow lines at at 0.91  kev and 1.06  kev , at least in the low - state . since the full - width half maximum ( fwhm ) energy resolution of the lecs is 0.2  kev at 1  kev , these features are not well resolved in the lecs and so the broad feature was replaced by two narrow lines with the energies fixed at the above values in all subsequent fits .",
    "we refer to this as the `` standard '' model .",
    "the fit results presented in table  [ tab : ave_fits ] indicate that this model adequately describes the m1 , s1 , s2 and s4 spectra , but not the s3 spectrum where a @xmath12 of 383 for 83 degrees of freedom ( dof ) is obtained .",
    "the fit quality of the s2 spectrum is somewhat worse than to the m1 , s1 , and s4 spectra .",
    "this may be because of unresolved variability which was not excluded from the accumulation ( see the upper and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "the s4 spectrum is significantly harder and the equivalent width ( ew ) of the fe - k line is higher than the other spectra ( table  [ tab : ave_fits ] ) .",
    "there is no comparable change in the ew of the fe - l lines .",
    "the intense fe - k feature is clearly visible in the s4 spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "there is no significant change in fe - k line energy between the spectra .",
    "the equivalent blackbody radii are @xmath3200  km for intervals m1 , s1 and s2 , decreasing to @xmath3150  km during s3 and @xmath370  km during s4 .",
    "the ratio of 0.110.0  kev flux in the blackbody component compared to the powerlaw is 16% for all the spectra except s3 , where is it 9% .",
    "the effects of significant absorption are clearly seen in the s3 spectrum as a change in spectral shape and increased curvature in the 13 kev range ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "this implies an absorption of @xmath0@xmath13  atom  @xmath2 .",
    "however , substantial flux remains @xmath140.5 kev , which should be _ completely _ absorbed with such a high absorption .",
    "there are a number of possible explanations for such behavior : ( 1 ) the presence of separate `` scattered '' and `` absorbed '' spectral components , ( 2 ) partial covering of the emitting region(s ) , and ( 3 ) absorption by partially ionized material such that the low @xmath15 materials responsible for the majority of the absorption @xmath140.5  kev are significantly ionized , while the higher @xmath15 elements are not .",
    "possibilities ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) can not be spectrally distinguished and are referred to as `` partial covering '' , although this should be taken to include the possibility of separate scattering and absorbing regions .",
    "partial covering can be modeled using the pcfabs model in xspec . here a fraction , f , of the emission undergoes extra absorption , @xmath16 , while the rest is absorbed by a low value of , as before .",
    "the partial covering model gives an acceptable fit to the s3 spectrum ( a @xmath17 of 115.7 for 82 dof ) , while that of an ionized absorber ( the absori model in xspec ) is somewhat worse ( @xmath18 for 83 dof ) .",
    "we therefore do not pursue further the ionized absorber fits since the partial covering model provides a better fit .",
    "as previously stated , the `` standard model '' gives a significantly harder spectrum ( @xmath19 ) for interval s4 than for the other spectra , where the average is @xmath30.8 .",
    "we have investigated whether this apparent hardness may result from a large amount of intrinsic absorption which , if not modeled correctly , results in an anomalously hard spectral slope determination .",
    "the partial covering model was also fit to the s4 spectrum , even though the `` standard '' model provides an adequate description of the spectrum ( @xmath20 for 84 dof ) .",
    "this gives a partial covering fraction of @xmath21 and extra absorption , @xmath16 , of @xmath22  atom  @xmath2 .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath8 is now @xmath23 , much closer to the values obtained in the other fits .",
    "this suggests that an explanation for the hard spectra ( relative to the peak of the main - on state where @xmath24 ) seen at times from  is the effects of large amounts of unresolved absorption , together with partial covering .",
    "the  pulse periods were determined using only the non - dip and non - eclipse data obtained during the main- and short - on state observations .",
    "first , the arrival times of the photons were corrected to the solar system barycenter .",
    "then the arrival times were additionally corrected to the  center of mass using the ephemeris of deeter et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the periods were obtained with an epoch - folding technique using the mecs data , while the ( 1@xmath25 ) uncertainties were determined by fitting the arrival times of sets of 6 averaged profiles . during the main- and short - on states the best - fit periods are 1.2377268@xmath260.0000009  s and 1.2377272@xmath260.00000015  s , respectively .",
    "the pulse profiles obtained by folding the data with these best - fit periods in different energy bands are shown in fig.[fig : pulse ] . the well - known , strongly energy - dependent , pulse profile of her  x-1 is evident . in general , the main - on state profiles all exhibit greater modulation depth than those obtained during the short - on state .",
    "the smooth almost sinusoidal 0.11.0  kev profiles are dominated by emission from the blackbody and fe - l lines , while the 24  kev and 410  kev profiles are dominated by the power - law .",
    "the 24  kev main - on state profile is more sharply peaked and has a larger amplitude than that obtained during the short - on state .",
    "the 12  kev energy range clearly marks the transition between the profiles dominated by these different spectral components and it has a very structured appearance . in this energy range",
    "the difference in profiles is the largest between the two on - states .",
    "the data obtained during intervals s1 and s2 ( short - on ) and m1 were used to investigate the pulse phase dependence of the spectrum .",
    "only the s1 and s2 intervals were included in the low - state accumulation since the spectra obtained during s3 and s4 are clearly different from those obtained elsewhere in the low - state .",
    "both sets of data were divided into 10 equal phase bins , which gives comparable ( within a factor of two ) statistics .",
    "( note that this is half the number of phase bins used by o97 , since the total number of counts in both observations is much smaller than that in the svp observation . )",
    "the spectra were rebinned and energy selected as above .",
    "the 10 phase - resolved spectra were fit using the `` standard model '' except that , the fe - l line energies , the fe - k line energy and width and lecs / mecs relative normalization were fixed at their best - fit values obtained from the fits to the phase - averaged spectra ( table  [ tab : ave_fits ] ) .",
    "the best - fit values from the m1 and s1 fits were used for the main- and short - on states phase resolved fits , respectively .",
    "the fits to the phase - resolved spectra give acceptable values of @xmath27  of typically 0.91.3 for 80110 dof .",
    "[ fig : phase ] shows the variations in best - fit spectral parameters as a function of pulse phase .",
    "variations in all the fit parameters , except the strengths of both fe lines and the blackbody kt are evident .",
    "comparison of the left- and right - hand panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] shows that the phase differences between the blackbody and power - law normalizations are approximately the same for the main- and short - on states .",
    "the amplitude of variation of the power - law component is smaller during the short - on state observation ( @xmath325% ) , compared to during the main - on state observation ( @xmath28% ) .",
    "the intensity of the fe - l line appears to be relatively constant .",
    "the phase dependence of the fe - k line intensity is not well determined , but is consistent with having the same behavior as the power - law normalization , or with having no variation with pulse phase .",
    "this is in contrast to the _ ginga _ results of choi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , where the blackbody and fe - k line normalizations appear to be correlated .",
    "the ratio of the blackbody to power - law fluxes are , during the main - on state , 18% and 15% for the pulse minima and maxima , respectively and 16% and 20% during the short - on state .",
    "similar values can be derived from o97 .",
    "this means that the reprocessing fraction is similar in all the observations , implying that the amount of reprocessing does not depend strongly on @xmath7 .",
    "the best - fit equivalent blackbody radii are consistent with being identical between the main - on and the beginning ( s1 and s2 ) of the short - on at @xmath3210  km , while in the latter phases of the short - on it decreases to @xmath29100  km .",
    "this may indicate that about 75% the blackbody reprocessing site is obscured during the later parts of the short - on state .",
    "a cross - correlation between the best - fit power - law and blackbody normalizations obtained during the main- and short - on states reveals that in both cases the phase difference is consistent with a separation of @xmath4 .",
    "this value is marginally consistent with the phase difference of @xmath30 obtained earlier in the main - on state by o97 .",
    "however , due to the broad , asymmetric profiles that are different in each observation ( see fig  [ fig : phase ] and o97 ) it is difficult to reliably measure the pulse phase difference between the two components and so probe any changes of ( relative ) positions of the emission and reprocessing regions .",
    "we report on a long ( 5.7  day duration ) observation of most of the short - on state of  with the bepposax lecs and mecs together with a short observation during the declining phase of the preceding main - on state .",
    "we find that the main - on and early short - on state spectra can be well fit with the standard blackbody and power - law continuum model , together with fe - l and fe - k emission features . during the later phases of the short - on",
    "there is evidence for intervals of strong low - energy absorption .",
    "these intervals repeat each 1.7  day orbital cycle , becoming increasingly long and occurring earlier in each orbital cycle as the short - on state progresses .",
    "this behavior appears to be consistent with the predictions of the warped disk model of e.g. , schandl & meyer ( @xcite ) and schandl ( @xcite ) where the end of the short - on state is caused by the accretion disk moving into the line of sight to the neutron star .",
    "these results therefore support the idea that the  system contains a warped , precessing , accretion disk .",
    "the shape and intensity of the s4 spectrum is very similar to that measured by mihara et al .",
    "( @xcite ) during the _ low - state _ of  by _",
    "ginga_. they model the spectrum with `` scattered '' and absorbed (=",
    "@xmath31  atom  @xmath2 ) components and a power - law index equivalent to that found in the main - on state .",
    "in addition , their best - fit fe - k line energy , fwhm and ew of @xmath32  kev , @xmath33  kev , and @xmath34  kev , respectively are all strikingly similar to those reported here for interval s4 ( table  [ tab : ave_fits ] ) .",
    "these bepposax observations therefore support the idea , first proposed by mihara et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , that the low - state  emission contains at least two components , one of which is significantly absorbed .",
    "the pulse profiles ( broad and almost sinusoidal ) in both the main- and short - on states are consistent with those reported by deeter at al.(@xcite ) obtained with _ ginga _ at similar @xmath7 .",
    "deeter et al.(@xcite ) show that the pulse shape during the main - on state changes rapidly from a clearly peaked shape to a much broader , more sinusoidal , shape during the final stages of the main - on state .",
    "the best - fit pulse periods demonstrate that  is continuing its recent spin - up trend as shown in bildsten et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the pulse phase difference of the maxima of the power - law and blackbody during the short- and main - on state observations is consistent with being the same , and consistent with the results of o97 , obtained earlier in the main - on state .",
    "such a symmetry is expected for a reprocessing region located at , or near , the inner edge of the accretion disk since at @xmath35 and 0.5 the same behavior is predicted .",
    "this is because of the symmetrical disk shape expected unless the region of the disk where the reprocessing occurs is strongly warped ( see e.g.heemskerk & van paradijs @xcite for this `` symmetry - rule '' ) .",
