    "a recent publication by scielzo _",
    "et al._@xcite reported a measurement of the @xmath1-@xmath2 angular correlation coefficient , @xmath4 , for the @xmath1-decay transition between @xmath0na and the ground state of its mirror , @xmath0ne .",
    "the authors compare their result with the standard - model prediction for @xmath4 , with a view to testing for scalar or tensor currents , the presence of which would signal the need for an extension of the standard model .",
    "although they found a significant discrepancy  the measured value , @xmath5 , disagrees with the standard - model prediction of 0.558  they stop short of claiming a fundamental disagreement with the standard model .",
    "scielzo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite offer two alternative explanations that would have to be eliminated before their result could begin to raise questions about the need for an extension to the standard model .",
    "one is that some @xmath0na@xmath6 dimers formed by cold photoassociation could also have been present in their trap , thus distorting the result ; they themselves propose to do further measurements to test that possibility .",
    "the other is that the branching - ratio value they used for @xmath1 decay to the first excited state of @xmath0ne might not be correct . because scielzo s measurement could not distinguish between positrons from the two predominant @xmath1-decay branches from @xmath0na ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , the adopted branching ratio for the @xmath1 transition to the first excited state not only affects their data analysis but also helps determine the theoretical prediction for @xmath4 itself , since the axial - vector component of the ground - state branch can only be determined from its @xmath7 value , which also depends on the branching ratio .",
    "this branching ratio is a key component of their standard - model test , yet the five published values @xcite are between 25 and 45 years old , are quite inconsistent with one another and range from 2.2(3 ) to 5.1(2)% . to remedy this problem ,",
    "we report here a new measurement of the ground - state branching ratio , for which we quote @xmath80.8% relative precision , five times better than the best precision claimed in any previous measurement .",
    "we produced 22.5-s @xmath0na using a 28_a_-mev @xmath9ne beam from the texas a&m k500 superconducting cyclotron to initiate the @xmath10h(@xmath9ne , @xmath11)@xmath0na reaction on a ln@xmath6-cooled hydrogen gas target .",
    "the ejectiles from the reaction were fully stripped and , after passing through the mars spectrometer @xcite , produced a @xmath0na secondary beam of @xmath1299% purity at the extraction slits in the mars focal plane .",
    "this beam , containing @xmath13@xmath14 atoms / s at @xmath15 mev , then exited the vacuum system through a 50-@xmath16m - thick kapton window , passed successively through a 0.3-mm - thick bc-404 scintillator and a stack of aluminum degraders , finally stopping in the 76-@xmath16m - thick aluminized mylar tape of a tape transport system . since the few impurities remaining in the beam had ranges different from that of @xmath0na , most were not collected on the tape ; residual collected impurities were concluded to be less than @xmath17% of the @xmath0na content .    in a typical measurement",
    ", we collected @xmath0na on the tape for a few seconds , then interrupted the beam and triggered the tape - transport system to move the sample in 180 ms to a shielded counting station located 90 cm away , where the sample was positioned between a 1-mm - thick bc404 scintillator to detect @xmath18 particles , and a 70% hpge detector for @xmath19 rays .",
    "two timing modes were used : in one , the collection and detection periods were 3 and 30 s , respectively ; in the other , they were 6 and 60 s. in both cases , after the detection period was complete , the cycle was repeated and , in all , some 3,200 cycles were completed over a span of 32 hours .",
    "time - tagged @xmath1-@xmath19 coincidence data were stored event by event .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath19-ray energies , the coincidence time between them , and the time of the event after the beginning of the cycle were all recorded , as was the total number of @xmath1-singles events for each cycle . the same discriminator signal used for scaling was also used in establishing the @xmath1-@xmath19 coincidences .",
    "essential to our experimental method is the precise absolute efficiency of the @xmath19-ray detector , which was positioned 15 cm from the collected sample .",
    "we have meticulously calibrated our hpge detector at this distance over a five - year period using , in total , 13 individual sources from 10 different radionuclides : @xmath20cr , @xmath21co , @xmath22y , @xmath23ag , @xmath24cd , @xmath25sb , @xmath26ba , @xmath27cs , @xmath28cs and @xmath29hf .",
    "two of the @xmath21co sources were specially prepared by the physikalisch - technische bundesanstalt @xcite with activities certified to 0.06% .",
    "the details of our calibration procedures , which include both source measurements and monte carlo calculations , have been published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the absolute efficiency of our detector is known to 0.2% in the energy range from 50 to 1400 kev , and to 0.4% from 1400 kev to 3.5 mev .",
    "the absolute efficiency of the @xmath18 detector , which was located 1.5 cm from the collected sample , is not required for our measurement but its dependence on energy is of some importance ( see section [ res ] ) .",
    "we have explored the efficiency of this detector _ via _ measurements and monte carlo calculations , and its dependence on @xmath18 energy is now reasonably well understood @xcite .    a typical @xmath19-ray spectrum recorded in coincidence with betas is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "apart from the annihilation radiation , the only significant peak in the spectrum is the 351-kev @xmath19 ray from the first excited state in @xmath0ne . in 3,200 total cycles we recorded more than @xmath30 counts in this peak .",
    "it was important to our later analysis that we establish the contribution of room background both to the @xmath1-@xmath19 coincidence spectrum and to the @xmath1-detector singles rate .",
    "for this purpose , we recorded data with the cyclotron beam on but with a thick degrader inserted just upstream from the tape ; everything was thus identical to a normal measurement except that no @xmath0na was implanted in the tape . both the coincidence and singles rates were observed to drop to 0.04% of the rate observed when @xmath0na was correctly implanted .",
    "room background was thus effectively negligible in our analysis .",
    "the @xmath1-decay scheme of @xmath0na is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the only branch in addition to those populating the ground and first excited states is known to be very weak @xcite and can be ignored in our analysis . in that case , the branching ratio , @xmath31 , for population of the first excited state can be determined from the measured intensity ratio of the 351-kev @xmath19 ray relative to the total number of @xmath0na decays .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath31 from the following relationship : r_1 = k , [ r ] where @xmath32 is the number of 351-kev @xmath19 rays observed in coincidence with betas ; @xmath33 is the number of ( singles ) betas observed ; @xmath34 is the efficiency of the hpge detector for 351-kev @xmath19 rays ; and @xmath35 is a factor ( @xmath13 1 ) that accounts for small experimental corrections that will be enumerated in what follows .",
    "note that the efficiency of the beta detector does not appear in eq .",
    "[ r ] , although its dependence on @xmath18 energy will be seen to play a minor role in the evaluation of @xmath35 .    before determining the ratio @xmath36 from our data , we eliminated those cycles in which the collected source was not positioned exactly between the @xmath1 and @xmath19 detectors .",
    "although the tape - transport system is quite consistent in placing the collected source within @xmath37 mm of the designated counting location , it is a mechanical system , and occasionally larger deviations occur . for each cycle we recorded not only the total number of positrons detected but also the total number of @xmath0na ions that emerged from the mars spectrometer , as detected by the scintillator located immediately in front of the aluminum degraders .",
    "the ratio of the former to the latter is a very sensitive measure of how well the source is positioned with respect to the @xmath1 detector . in analyzing the data",
    ", we rejected the results from any cycle with an anomalous ( low ) ratio . under these conditions",
    ", we obtained the result @xmath38 .",
    "as stated in section [ exp ] , the absolute efficiency , @xmath39 , of our detector at 15 cm is known to @xmath40 .",
    "however , this applies to a highly controlled situation in which the source - to - detector distance can be measured by micrometer to a small fraction of a millimeter . with the fast tape - transport delivery system",
    ", we can not be assured of reproducibility at the same level of precision .",
    "taking @xmath41 mm to be our actual uncertainty in position under experimental conditions , we add an uncertainty of @xmath42 to the detector efficiency in quadrature with the basic @xmath40 uncertainty . for the 351-kev @xmath19 ray , this leads to @xmath43 , the value we insert in eq .",
    "[ r ] .    although the ratio @xmath36 and @xmath39 are the predominant experimental quantities required to evaluate the branching ratio , it is the correction factor @xmath35 that holds the key to our achieving high precision .",
    "in fact , @xmath35 is really a product of four separate corrections , @xmath44 .",
    "we will deal with each individually .",
    "_ random coincidences @xmath45 .",
    " _ since the time between each coincident @xmath1 and @xmath19 ray was recorded event by event , we could project out the time spectrum corresponding to the 351-kev @xmath19 ray . in that spectrum ,",
    "the prompt coincidence peak stood prominently above the flat random distribution , allowing us clearly to distinguish the relative contributions of real and random coincidences .",
    "the correction factor required to account for the random contribution to the @xmath1-coincident 351-kev @xmath19-ray peak was thus determined to be @xmath46 = 0.9884(10 ) . naturally , this correction accounts not only for random coincidences among @xmath0na @xmath1 and @xmath19 rays but also for random coincidences between @xmath0na betas and any @xmath19 rays originating from room background .",
    "_ real - coincidence summing @xmath47. _ since each 351-kev @xmath19 ray from the decay of the first excited state in @xmath0ne is accompanied by a positron from the @xmath0na @xmath18-decay branch that populated the state , there is a significant probability that a 351-kev @xmath19 ray and 511-kev annihilation radiation will reach our hpge detector simultaneously and be recorded as a single @xmath19 ray with the combined energy of both .",
    "any summing of this kind will rob events from the 351-kev photopeak .",
    "our first step in accounting for the resultant loss was to obtain the area of the observed 862-kev ( 511 + 351 ) sum peak . since losses from the 351-kev photopeak result not just from its summing with the 511-kev photopeak but also with the latter s compton scattered radiation , as a second step we multiplied the sum - peak area by the known  total - to - peak \" ratio for our detector at 511 kev ( see fig .",
    "11 in reference @xcite ) .",
    "finally , this result for losses was increased by 4% to account for annihilation in flight , which leads to 351-kev peak summing with annihilation radiation of different energies , and by another 2.5% to account for summing with positrons backscattered from the plastic scintillator .",
    "the total loss due to real - coincidence summing was thus determined to be 1.78% : _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath48 = 1.0178(17 ) .",
    "_ dead time @xmath49. _ equation [ r ] depends upon @xmath32 and @xmath33 being recorded for identical times . in our experiment",
    "they were , of course , gated on and off together , but during the counting period the circuit dead time for @xmath32 , which was limited by the relatively slow electronics used for @xmath19-ray counting , was much greater than that for @xmath33 , which was simply scaled .",
    "we determined the dead time associated with @xmath32 from the total rate in the hpge detector during the counting period and from the known processing time ( 32 @xmath16s ) for each coincident event .",
    "the scaler dead time per event was only 100 ns but the total rate in the scaler was much higher than the hpge rate ; nevertheless the dead time associated with @xmath33 turned out to be smaller by a factor of three than that associated with coincidence events .",
    "the overall correction factor is @xmath50 = 1.0018(1 ) .",
    "[ b ]    .error budget for the measured branching ratio @xmath31 [ err ] [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     given the age of the previous measurements and the potential hazards associated with their experimental method  not to mention their mutual inconsistency ",
    "we choose not to average our result with them but instead to use our present result alone in extracting the properties of the @xmath0na @xmath1-decay scheme .",
    "since there are only two significant @xmath1-decay branches from @xmath0na  to the ground and first excited states of the daughter  with @xmath31 determined , the branching ratio to the ground state , @xmath51 , follows directly from it : r_0 = 0.9526(4 ) , [ r0 ] where this result is actually determined to a precision of 0.04% .",
    "we now proceed from this value for @xmath51 to obtain the @xmath7 value for this transition , the relative contributions of axial - vector and vector components , and ultimately the standard - model expectation for its @xmath1-@xmath2 angular correlation coefficient .    in deriving the @xmath7 value for the ground - state mirror transition",
    ", we take the half - life of @xmath0na to be @xmath52 = 22.49(4 ) s and its total decay energy to be @xmath53 = 3547.6(7 ) kev . the former is the average of two mutually consistent results @xcite and the latter is the value quoted in the 2003 atomic mass evaluation @xcite where it was obtained from a single @xmath54ne(p,@xmath19)@xmath0na measurement made in 1969 @xcite and then revised by audi _",
    "@xcite to take account of more up - to - date calibration energies . with the calculated electron - capture probability for the ground - state transition being 0.00095 , the average half life , when combined with our branching ratio value from eq .",
    "[ r0 ] , yields a partial half - life for the transition of 23.63(4 ) s.    next we compute the value of @xmath55 from the @xmath53 value following methods similar to those we used in the analysis of superallowed @xmath1 decay ; these are described in the appendix to reference @xcite . to make an  exact \" calculation that includes , for example , the effects of weak magnetism and other induced corrections we need a shell - model calculation of the appropriate nuclear matrix elements . for this",
    "we used an @xmath56-shell model space and the universal @xmath56-shell effective interaction of wildenthal @xcite . this interaction has been demonstrated @xcite to reproduce energy spectra and gamow - teller matrix elements in this mass region providing that the axial - vector coupling constant is quenched . in our calculation , we fine - tuned the amount of quenching to reproduce our experimental data ( see eq . [ lambdaexp ] ) .",
    "this corresponded to @xmath57 and is essentially the same result that brown and wildenthal @xcite established for the shell as a whole . ] .    for a mirror transition like this one , which includes",
    "both vector and axial - vector components , the @xmath55 value calculated for the vector part of the weak interaction , @xmath58 , is slightly different from the value calculated for the axial - vector part , @xmath59 . in the allowed approximation",
    "it is always assumed that @xmath58 = @xmath59 = @xmath55 but , where high precision is sought , a more exact calculation is required .",
    "the results we obtain , @xmath58 = 170.974 and @xmath59 = 174.157 , are nearly 2% different from one another , principally as a result of the influence of weak magnetism on the shape correction factor of the axial - vector component . in quoting the @xmath7 value for the mirror ground - state transition",
    ", we make the ( arbitrary ) choice to use @xmath58 , with the result that t = 4040(9 ) s .",
    "[ ft ]    like any other @xmath7 value , this result can be related to vector and axial - vector coupling constants , and to the matrix elements pertaining to the specific transition .",
    "to do so with the precision required for a standard - model test requires that radiative and charge - dependent corrections be incorporated .",
    "the expression we use is the following : ^21 ^ 2(1 + _ ns - _ c ) ( 1 + )   & & + + ^2 ^ 2(1 - _",

    "the transition - dependent radiative correction terms , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and the isospin - symmetry - breaking correction , @xmath69 , all have their conventional definitions @xcite but , in the present context of a mixed vector and axial - vector transition , we note that @xmath67 is the same for both components while @xmath69 and @xmath68 only pertain to the vector component .",
    "the latter two terms have their equivalents that must be applied to the axial - vector component but we subsume them into a term we call @xmath70 : as it turns out , we will not have to calculate a value for @xmath70 . finally , the transition - independent radiative correction also takes on different values for the vector and axial - vector components , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ; but neither will have to be calculated .    rearranging eq .",

    "[ lambda ] here @xmath73 is the ratio of axial - vector to vector components in the transition .",
    "a further simplification in this equation can be achieved by our implementing the results from superallowed @xmath74 beta decays , which provide an experimental determination of the product @xmath75 .",
    "the average corrected @xmath76 value from these decays @xcite is related to the vector coupling constant via the relationship : = .",
    "[ ft ]    since it is the term @xmath73 that we need to extract from experiment in order to calculate the @xmath1-@xmath2 angular correlation coefficient , we now re - express eq .",
    "[ ftcor ] in the following form : ^2 = -1 .",
    "[ lambda1 ] we have calculated the three remaining correction terms using the same methods as were described in reference @xcite , the results being @xmath67 = 1.492(15)% , @xmath69 = 0.268(16)% and @xmath68 = -0.065(20)% .",
    "we then adopt the value , @xmath77 = 3072.7(8 ) , which is the average result extracted from superallowed @xmath74 beta decays when the correction terms are calculated by the same methods as those used here ( see eq .",

    "thus we finally obtain = 0.7033(24 ) [ lambdaexp ] for the ground - state mirror transition .",
    "based on this result for @xmath73 we have computed the beta - neutrino correlation coefficient exactly , following the formalism of behrens - bhring @xcite .",

    "the sum is over @xmath82 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath83 are expressed fully by behrens and bhring @xcite , from which it can be seen that @xmath84 is exactly equal to 1.0 , and @xmath85 is small .",
