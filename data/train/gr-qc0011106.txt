    "loop quantum gravity is a canonical approach to the quantization of general relativity which has undergone lively progress in the last decade , yielding a well - defined framework for the nonperturbative formulation of background - independent quantum field theory ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the elusive issues in this approach is the identification of the physically correct hamiltonian constraint operator ( hco ) , encoding the dynamics of classical general relativity .",
    "the correct form of the hco has long been searched @xcite . a mathematically well - defined and anomaly - free hco was found by thiemann in 1996 @xcite , developing ideas and techniques introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although certain doubts concerning the correctness of the classical limit of this operator have been raised @xcite , ongoing work on coherent states and semi - classical quantum gravity @xcite should clarify the issue , and the thiemann operator remains a very appealing candidate for the hco of the physical theory .",
    "on the other hand , the construction of the thiemann operator involves some arbitrary choices , or quantization ambiguities , and the possibility of exploring alternatives is open . in this work ,",
    "we analyze one of the quantization ambiguities entering the definition of the hco , and a corresponding variant of thiemann s hco .",
    "in particular , we study a family of operators @xmath7 labelled by irreducible @xmath0 representations irreps with the  color \" @xmath8 , which is twice the spin , thus @xmath9 . ]",
    "@xmath10 , all having the same classical limit , namely the classical hamiltonian constraint of general relativity .",
    "thiemann s hco corresponds to the fundamental representation @xmath11 . in a nutshell",
    ", the hco requires a gauge invariant point - splitting - like regularization , which is obtained by using the trace of the holonomy of the gravitational connection .",
    "it turns out that by choosing the representation-@xmath10 trace , we obtain a distinct operator with the same classical limit : the @xmath7 version of the hco .    the hco operator introduced in references @xcite and @xcite adds a link of color 1 to the nodes of the spin network states .",
    "thiemann s operator @xmath12 , modeled on the former , acts in the same way . on the other hand ,",
    "the operators @xmath7 for arbitrary @xmath10 , which we study here , act on the spin network states by adding a link of color @xmath10 .",
    "the possibility of this variant of the hco has been suggested also by roberto de pietri and laurent freidel @xcite .",
    "this extension is motivated by the spacetime covariant formulation of the theory .",
    "a ( euclidean ) `` path integral''-like sum - over - histories approach can be formally derived from the canonical theory @xcite .",
    "histories are represented by spin foams , that is , branched colored 2-dimensional surfaces ( 2-complexes ) @xcite .",
    "the resulting model has close connections with topological field theories , as well as their non - topological extensions like the barrett - crane @xcite model , and to simplicial models of quantum gravity .",
    "the key ingredient of a spin foam model is its vertex amplitude . in the spin foam model arising from loop quantum gravity ,",
    "the vertex amplitude is given by the matrix elements of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the problem of finding the correct hco is thus translated into the problem of finding the correct vertex amplitude . in the covariant framework , however , we have the advantage of manifest 4d general covariance . in particular , if we consider the euclidean sector , the vertex amplitude should be rotationally invariant @xcite , a requirement denoted _ crossing symmetry_. it is easy to see , using counter - examples , that thiemann s hco does _ not _ yield a crossing symmetric vertex amplitude .",
    "the reason is that crossing symmetry rotates the link added by the constraint into links of the state acted upon , but the first one has always color 1 , while the latter have arbitrary colors . in searching for a crossing symmetric variant of thiemann s hco ,",
    "one is thus naturally led to consider hco s @xmath7 that add links of arbitrary color @xmath10 . in this paper , we show in detail that quantization ambiguities do indeed allow us to define such operators , and we study the action of these operators on trivalent states . on the other hand , we shall not address here the problem of the existence of a crossing symmetric linear combination of such operators @xmath13 , which would actually define a crossing symmetric quantization of the hamiltonian constraint of general relativity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section we construct the generalized hco s @xmath7 , closely following thiemann s construction @xcite .",
    "we show that these form a family of anomaly - free , classically equivalent operators . we also show that no analogous ambiguity emerges for similar generalizations of simpler operators like area or volume .",
    "in other words , the ambiguity is a feature of the complications of the dynamical operator , not a generic ambiguity in the formalism .",
    "we then restrict our attention to the euclidean part of the @xmath7 , and we compute their action on generic ( gauge - invariant ) trivalent vertices . to this aim , we use the powerful graphical computational techniques of the tangle - theoretic temperley - lieb recoupling theory .",
    "this work generalizes the results of reference @xcite on thiemann s hco to arbitrary @xmath10 .",
    "we obtain a final form that is appropriate for further considerations concerning crossing symmetry .    in appendix",
    "[ app : thiemannshco ] , the particular case which corresponds to the original definition of the hamiltonian constraint operator is addressed .",
    "its matrix elements have already been computed in @xcite , giving the opportunity for a consistency check .",
    "restrictions of the general expression to @xmath14 confirm our result . appendix [ app : recoupl_theory ] outlines the basic facts and the most commonly used identities of recoupling theory that are needed throughout the text .    for the general framework of loop quantum gravity and for details on the computational tools we use here ,",
