    "the effects induced by magnetic fields in low - dimensional magnets are subjects of intensive theoretical and experimental research @xcite .",
    "one of the striking effects is the dependence of magnetic properties of quasi - one - dimensional antiferromagnets with anisotropic exchange interactions on the direction of the applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the basic model of such type of magnets is the anisotropic heisenberg chain - so - called @xmath0 model .",
    "it is , therefore , important to study the dependence of the properties of the @xmath0 chain on the field direction .",
    "there are two studied cases of the field direction .",
    "first of them is the @xmath0 model in the uniform longitudinal magnetic field .",
    "this model is exactly solved by the bethe ansatz @xcite and is studied in great details . in the second case",
    "the field is applied in the transverse direction .",
    "the @xmath0 model in the transverse field can not be solved exactly and various approximate methods have been used to its study @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath0 model in the symmetry - breaking transverse field is essentially different from the case of the longitudinal field .",
    "in particular , the transverse field induces the perpendicular antiferromagnetic long - range order ( lro ) and the ground state quantum phase transition takes place at some critical field , where the lro and the gap in spectrum vanish .",
    "the phase transition of this type has been observed in the quasi - one - dimensional antiferromagnet @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in fact , the magnetic field can have both the longitudinal and the transverse components .",
    "for example , the magnetic field in recent neutron scattering experiments on @xmath4 has been applied at an angle to the anisotropy axes . from this point , it is of a particular interest to study the ground state properties of the spin @xmath5 @xmath0 chain in coexisting longitudinal @xmath6 and transverse magnetic fields @xmath7 .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the effective dimensionless transverse ( longitudinal ) magnetic field , @xmath10 is the exchange constant and @xmath11 is the anisotropy parameter , which is assumed to be @xmath12 .",
    "it was proposed @xcite that low - energy properties of @xmath3 in the external magnetic field is described by the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) with @xmath13 and @xmath14 mev .",
    "evidently , in the case @xmath15 the behavior of the system does not depend on the magnetic field direction and the model ( [ h ] ) reduces to the isotropic heisenberg chain in a magnetic field @xmath16 . in the limiting case",
    "@xmath17 the model ( [ h ] ) reduces to the antiferromagnetic ising chain in a mixed longitudinal and transverse field .",
    "this model was investigated in @xcite , where it was shown that there is a critical line in the @xmath18 plane , where the ground state phase transition takes place .",
    "the critical behavior in the vicinity of this transition line belongs to the universality class of the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "thus , the physics of the model ( [ h ] ) is very well understood in the case @xmath19 and is fairly good for the cases @xmath20 and @xmath21 , but no detailed studies are available in general case . in this paper",
    "we study the model ( [ h ] ) using the mean - field approximation , which is the generalization of the approach developed in @xcite for the case @xmath20 .",
    "this method allows us to determine the transition line with high accuracy .",
    "the behavior in low-@xmath22 region will be considered using the conformal field theory method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we consider a qualitative physical picture of the ground state phase diagram based on the classical approximation . in",
    "sec.iii the mean - field approach is developed and study of the critical properties of the model is presented .",
    "scaling estimations of the gap and the lro in low-@xmath22 region are given in sec.iv .",
    "the special case @xmath23 is studied in sec.v . in sec.vi",
    "we discuss our results in relation to the experimental data for @xmath24 .",
    "in order to provide a physical picture of the phase diagram of the model ( [ h ] ) we use the classical approximation , when spins are represented as three - dimensional vectors .",
    "the variational wave function corresponding to the classical approximation has a form of a simple direct product of single - site spin states @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26and @xmath27 are variational parameters . if @xmath28 @xmath27 then the ground state is two - fold degenerated and another ground state wave function is @xmath29    the form of the variational parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 minimizing the energy is different in the regions @xmath30 and @xmath31 . for the case",

    "the same notations as on fig.1 .",
    "the boundary of incommensurate critical ( ic ) phase is shown schematically ( sec.iv ) . ]",
    "the case @xmath31 can be analyzed in a similar way . in this case",
    "two - fold degenerated ground state in the af phase is characterized by non - zero staggered magnetizations along the @xmath47 and @xmath48 axes .",
    "but the expression for the transition line is rather cumbersome and we do not present it here . the transition line in the classical approximation for @xmath49 is shown on fig.[fig_2 ] .",
    "as it is known @xcite there is a remarkable , so - called ` classical ' or disorder , line which lies in the af region in the ( @xmath50 ) plane and is given by the equation : @xmath51    the classical line is remarkable in a sense that the ground state on it is identical to the classical one and quantum fluctuations are missing .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the ground state of ( [ h ] ) on this line is two - fold degenerated and the exact ground state wave functions have the product form ( [ f1class ] ) and ( [ f2class ] ) .",
    "the ground state energy on the classical line for any even @xmath52 is @xmath53    from eqs.([aficlass ] ) one can find that in the case @xmath54 the magnetizations on the classical line are : @xmath55    for @xmath31 the parameters @xmath26and @xmath27 on the classical line are @xmath56 and the magnetizations on two sublattices are @xmath57    thus , the classical approach shows that the ground state is different in the regions with @xmath58 and @xmath31 . for @xmath58 the classical ground state is given by a configuration , where the spins on odd and even sites pointing respectively at angles @xmath59 and @xmath60 with respect to the @xmath61 plane . for @xmath31 in the ground state",
    "all spin vectors lie in the @xmath61 plane with the spins on odd and even sites pointing respectively at angles @xmath62 and @xmath63 with respect to the @xmath47 axis .",
    "this means that besides uniform magnetizations along @xmath47 and @xmath48 axes in the af region there is as well the staggered magnetizations : in the @xmath41 direction for @xmath58 and in both @xmath47 and @xmath48 directions for @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite these facts are confirmed on the classical line , where the classical approximation gives exact ground state .    of course",
    ", one can not expect that the classical approach gives accurate estimation of the transition line and correct description of the phase transition ( critical exponents ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as it will be shown below the fact of the generation of the staggered magnetizations in the @xmath41 direction for @xmath54 and in both the @xmath47 and the @xmath48 directions for @xmath31 is qualitative true .",
    "previously , the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) has been proposed to study the anisotropic heisenberg chain in the transverse magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it has been established that the mfa works very well if the transverse field is sufficiently strong and it gives qualitative results for intermediate fields . for @xmath64",
    "the mfa allows to determine with high accuracy the critical transverse field at which the order - disorder transition occurs and to describe correctly the behavior of the system in the transition region .",
    "the mfa is based on the jordan - wigner transformation of spin-@xmath65 operators to the fermi operators with the subsequent mean - field treatment of the fermi hamiltonian . in the case of coexisting transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields",
    "it is impossible to reduce the model hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) to a local form in terms of the fermi operators . nevertheless , for this complicated case the mfa can be modified . in this section",
    "we develop the special version of the mfa , which remains the variational approach .",
    "this approach gives high accuracy in determining of the transition line and correctly describes the whole ground state phase diagram .",
    "at first we perform a rotation of the spins in the @xmath61 plane by an angle @xmath66 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 are new spin-@xmath65 operators .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is transformed to the form @xmath69 where @xmath70    the angle @xmath66 is a variational parameter over which we will minimize the ground state energy .",
    "after jordan - wigner transformation to the fermi operators @xmath71 , @xmath72 @xmath73 the hamiltonian ( [ hrot ] ) takes the form @xmath74    we treat the hamiltonian @xmath75 in the mfa , which implies the decoupling of the four fermion term . the fermi representation",
    "@xmath76 has non - local form .",
    "but we note , that all terms in @xmath76 contain odd number of the fermi operators @xmath77 and , therefore , @xmath78 in the mfa .",
    "this fact holds the mfa in the frame of variational principle .",
    "thus , in the mfa the ground state energy @xmath79 and the one - particle excitation spectrum @xmath80 have the form : @xmath81 where @xmath82    quantities",
    "@xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the ground state expectation values , which are determined by the self - consistent equations : @xmath86    the solution of the self - consistent equations ( [ gamma ] ) gives the minimum of the ground state energy ( [ efermi ] ) in a class of a ` one - particle ' wave functions at a given angle @xmath66 .",
    "thus , one should minimize the energy ( [ efermi ] ) with respect to the angle @xmath66 , solving the self - consistent equations ( [ gamma ] ) for each value of @xmath66 .",
    "this means that the proposed procedure remains variational one .",
    "the physical meaning of the angle @xmath66 is to show a direction of the total magnetization of the model ( [ h ] ) @xmath87    transforming the mean - field treated fermi hamiltonian back to the spin operators , we arrive to the well - studied anisotropic @xmath88 model in a longitudinal magnetic field @xcite @xmath89 -u\\sum \\sigma _ { n}^{z }   \\label{hxy}\\ ] ]    the model ( [ hxy ] ) has a transition line defined by the equation @xmath90 which separates the region @xmath91 with the lro represented by a staggered magnetization from the region @xmath92 , where there is no lro except the uniform magnetization ( [ magnmf ] ) .",
    "the transition line @xmath93 is determined by the numerical solution of eqs.([gamma]),([translinemf ] ) with the minimization of the ground state energy over angle @xmath66 .",

    "these states are degenerate ( at @xmath102 in the ordered af phase .",
    "therefore , in the af phase the gap is given by the second excited state , while in the disordered pm phase the ground state is non - degenerate and the first excitation determines the gap in the spectrum .",
    "we have performed the dmrg calculations using the infinite - size algorithm and open boundary conditions and the number of states @xmath103 kept in the dmrg truncating procedure is up to 25 .",
    "we estimated the relative error due to dmrg truncation from difference between the data computed with @xmath104 and those with @xmath105 for chain lengths @xmath106 .",
    "the estimated relative error is of the order of @xmath107 which is sufficiently small for accurate estimates for the gap and the staggered magnetization . as an example , on figs.[fig_3 ] and [ fig_4 ] we show the plots of @xmath108 and the gap @xmath109 versus @xmath110 in the vicinity of the transition point for @xmath13 and fixed @xmath111 ( these parameters are related to those for the antiferromagnet @xmath24 ) .",
    "a good linearity of the plotted data definitely confirms the 2d ising character of the transition line .",

    "the correlation functions display a power - law decay with a magnetization dependent wave vector .",

    "unfortunately , neither the field theory approach nor the mfa allow us to determine the boundary of the ic phase .",
    "therefore , this phase boundary is shown on fig.[fig_2 ] schematically .",
    "further increasing of @xmath169 leads to the transition of the kosterlitz - thouless type taking place at the point @xmath217 where @xmath218 . at @xmath219 the perturbation @xmath200 becomes relevant ( @xmath220 ) and the system crosses from the ic phase to a strong - coupling regime with the staggered magnetizations in both @xmath47 and @xmath48 directions ( af phase ) .",

    "we study the behavior of the model in the critical phase from the perturbation theory point of view . in some sense",

    "therefore , since the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath150 conserves the value of @xmath234 , the perturbation theory in @xmath152 contains only even orders .",
    "the operator @xmath152 acting on the ground state or the low - lying states produces states with ` high ' energies @xmath235 .",

    "the behavior of the ground state correlation function @xmath242 of the model @xmath150 on large distances is known @xcite @xmath243 and , therefore , due to oscillation of the correlator @xmath244 ( for @xmath194 ) the sum over @xmath189 and @xmath109 can be approximately estimated as a one half of the first term : @xmath245    the last equation suggests that the perturbation @xmath241 can be reduced to the operator @xmath246 @xmath247 with some constants @xmath248 . in order to verify this assumption we compared the matrix elements of the operator @xmath246 with those of @xmath241 .",
    "we have found that the dependence of the matrix elements of the operators @xmath241 and @xmath249 on @xmath52 is identical .    as a result of the analysis we arrive at the effective hamiltonian @xmath250    again , the original model ( [ hhx0 ] ) is equivalent to the effective model ( [ hmap ] ) in a sense , that the perturbation series for both models have the same order of divergencies at each order of @xmath148 .",
    "this fact means that the effective model has the same critical exponents as the original model ( [ hhx0 ] ) .",
    "one can see , that the effective perturbation @xmath246 is nothing but the generated perturbation @xmath251 found in bosonization technique eq.([v1v2hz ] ) with @xmath252 .",
    "so , the above analysis represents another way to obtain an effective perturbation responsible for the most divergent part in the perturbation theory .",

    ".    the gap at @xmath254 and for @xmath273 can be asymptotically exactly described by the spin - wave theory @xcite .",
    "the validity of the spin - wave approximation is quite natural because the number of magnons forming the ground state is small for @xmath273 .",
    "the spin - wave result for the gap is @xmath274    for @xmath275 eq.([swtd-1 ] ) agrees with the conformal theory result eq.([m_d-1 ] ) at @xmath276 and gives the preexponential factor for the gap .",

    "the total magnetization at @xmath294 in the mfa @xmath295 is consistent with the saturation moment @xmath292 estimated in @xcite . at the same time , there is essential difference in the low - field behavior of @xmath290 .",
    "the experimental af ordered moment is finite at @xmath296 , while @xmath297 at @xmath296 on fig.[fig_6 ] .",
    "this difference is due to weak interchain couplings , which form the magnetically ordered ground state in the real compound at @xmath296 and this effect is absent in the one - dimensional model ( [ h ] ) .",
    "the behavior of the magnetizations in the vicinity of the critical field on fig.[fig_6 ] is similar to the experimental curve .",

    "we do not believe that the mfa is the reason for this discrepancy .",
    "the possible reason may lie in the fact that @xmath24 is described by the @xmath300 antiferromagnetic model with strong single - ion anisotropy and its reducing to the @xmath301 model is approximate .",
