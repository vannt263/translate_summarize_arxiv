    "highly correlated electron systems are characterized by a strong repulsion between electrons on the same lattice site , effectively restricting the dynamics to the fock subspace of states without double occupancy of sites .",
    "the prototype model for such systems is the anderson impurity model , which consists of an electron in a localized level @xmath0 ( called d - level in the following ) with on - site repulsion @xmath1 , hybridizing via a transition matrix element @xmath2 with one or several degenerate conduction electron bands or channels @xcite .",
    "depending on the number of channels @xmath3 , the model exhibits the single- or the multi - channel kondo effect , where at temperatures @xmath4 below the kondo temperature @xmath5 the local electron spin is screened ( @xmath6 ) or overscreened ( @xmath7 ) by the conduction electrons , leading to fermi liquid ( fl ) or to non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior @xcite with characteristic low - temperature singularities , respectively .    as perhaps the simplest model to investigate the salient features of correlations induced by short - range repulsion ,",
    "the anderson model plays a central role for the description of strongly correlated electron systems : in the limit of large spatial dimensions @xcite strongly correlated lattice systems reduce in general to a single anderson impurity hybridizing with a continuum of conduction electron states whose properties are determined from a self - consistency condition imposed by the translational invariance of the system @xcite .",
    "quantum impurity models have received further interest due to their relevance for mesoscopic systems like single electron transistors or defects in quantum point contacts .",
    "the above - mentioned systems call for the development of accurate and flexible theoretical methods , applicable to situations where exact solution methods are not available",
    ". we here present a general , well - controlled auxiliary boson technique which correctly describes the fl as well as the nfl case of the generalized su(n)@xmath8su(m ) anderson impurity model . as a standard diagram technique it has the potential",
    "to be generalized for correlated lattice problems as well as for non - equilibrium situations in mesoscopic systems .",
    "the auxiliary particle method @xcite is a powerful tool to implement the effective restriction to the sector of fock space with no double occupancy imposed by a large on - site repulsion @xmath1 .",
    "the creation operator for an electron with spin @xmath9 in the @xmath10-level is written in terms of fermionic operators @xmath11 and bosonic operators @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "this representation is exact , if the constraint that the total number operator of auxiliary fermions @xmath11 and bosons @xmath12 is equal to unity is obeyed . @xmath14 and @xmath15 may be envisaged as creating the three allowed states of the impurity : singly occupied with spin @xmath9 or empty .    in view of the possibility of both fl and nfl behavior in quantum impurity systems mentioned in the introduction it is useful",
    "to introduce @xmath3 degenerate channels for the conduction electron operators @xmath16 , labeled @xmath17 , in such a way that in the limit of impurity occupation number @xmath18 ( kondo limit ) the @xmath3-channel kondo model is recovered , i.e. the model obeys an su(m ) channel symmetry .",
    "the slave bosons then form an su(m ) multiplet @xmath19 which transforms according to the conjugate representation of su(m ) , so that @xmath20 is a conserved quantum number .",
    "generalizing , in addition , to arbitrary spin degeneracy @xmath21 , @xmath22 , one obtains the su(n)@xmath8su(m ) anderson impurity model in pseudoparticle representation @xmath23 where the local operator constraint @xmath24 must be fulfilled at all times .",
    "the system described by the auxiliary particle hamiltonian ( [ sbhamilton ] ) is invariant under simultaneous , local @xmath25 gauge transformations , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , with @xmath28 an arbitrary , time dependent phase . while the gauge symmetry guarantees the conservation of the local , integer charge @xmath29 , it does not single out any particular @xmath29 , like @xmath30 . in order to effect the projection onto the @xmath30 sector of fock space",
    ", one may use the following procedure @xcite : consider first the grand - canonical ensemble with respect to @xmath29 and the associated chemical potential @xmath31 .",
    "the expectation value in the @xmath30 subspace of any physical operator @xmath32 acting on the impurity states is then obtained as @xmath33 _ g }         { \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\zeta } \\mbox{tr }         \\bigl [ e^{-\\beta ( h+\\lambda q ) } \\bigr ] _ g } = \\lim _ { \\lambda \\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\langle \\hat a\\rangle _ g } { \\langle q \\rangle _ g}\\ , \\label{projection}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath34 denotes the grand canonical ensemble and @xmath35 is the fugacity @xmath36 . in the second equality of eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) we have used the fact that any physical operator @xmath32 acting on the impurity is composed of the impurity electron operators @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and thus annihilates the states in the @xmath39 sector , @xmath40 .",
    "it is obvious that the grand - canonical expectation value involved in eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) may be factorized into auxiliary particle propagators using wick s theorem , thus allowing for the application of standard diagrammatic techniques .",
    "the local u(1 ) gauge symmetry , which must not be broken according to elitzur s theorem @xcite , precludes the existence of an auxiliary bose condensate .",
    "the latter would imply a spurious phase transition at finite @xmath4 in quantum impurity models and should , therefore , be avoided in any approximation .",
    "it is important to note that , in general , @xmath41 plays the role of a time dependent gauge field . in eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) a time independent gauge for @xmath41 has been chosen . in this way",
    ", the projection is only performed at one instant of time , explicitly exploiting the conservation of the local charge @xmath29 .",
    "thus , choosing the time independent gauge means that in the subsequent development of the theory , the @xmath29 conservation must be implemented exactly .",
    "this is achieved in a systematic way by means of conserving approximations @xcite , i.e. by deriving all self - energies and vertices by functional derivation from one common luttinger - ward functional @xmath42 of the fully renormalized green s functions , @xmath43 this amounts to calculating all quantities of the theory in a self - consistent way , but has the great advantage that gauge field fluctuations need not be considered .",
    "the projection onto the physical subspace , eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) , implies that the pseudofermion and slave boson green s functions @xmath44 , @xmath45 are definied as the usual time - ordered , grand canonical expectation values of a pair of creation and annihilation operators , however evaluated in the limit @xmath46 .",
    "it follows that the traces involved in @xmath44 , @xmath45 are taken purely over the the @xmath39 sector of fock space , and thus the backward - in - time contribution to the auxiliary particle propagators vanishes .",
    "consequently , the auxiliary particle propagators are formally identical to the core hole propagators appearing in the well - known x - ray problem @xcite , and the long - time behavior of @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is determined by the orthogonality catastrophe @xcite of the overlap of the fermi sea without impurity ( @xmath39 ) and the fully interacting conduction electron sea in the presence of a pseudofermion ( slave boson ) ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "it may be shown that the auxiliary particle spectral functions have threshold behavior with vanishing spectral weight at @xmath47 for energies",
    "@xmath48 below a threshold @xmath49 , and power law behavior above @xmath49 , @xmath50 .    for the single - channel anderson model , which is known to have a fl ground state , the threshold exponents may be deduced from an analysis in terms of scattering phase shifts , using the friedel sum rule , since in the spin screened fl state the impurity acts as a pure potential scatterer @xcite , @xmath51 these results have been confirmed by numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) calculations @xcite and by use of the bethe ansatz solution in connection with boundary conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite . on the contrary , in the nfl case of the multi - channel kondo model",
    "the threshold exponents have been deduced by a cft solution @xcite as @xmath52 since the dependence of @xmath53 , @xmath54 on the impurity occupation number @xmath55 shown above originates from pure potential scattering , it is characteristic for the fl case .",
    "the auxiliary particle threshold exponents are , therefore , indicators for fl or nfl behavior in quantum impurity models of the anderson type .",
    "equivalently to the method shown in eq.([projection ] ) the projection onto the @xmath30 subspace can be represented as an integration over the parameter @xmath56 , @xmath57   \\int \\frac{d\\lambda}{2\\pi t } \\ , { \\rm e } ^{-\\beta [ i\\lambda ( q-1)+s\\ { f,\\bar f;b,\\bar b;c,\\bar c \\}]}\\ , \\langle \\hat a\\rangle _ g \\ , , \\label{sproj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the action of the anderson model corresponding to eq.([sbhamilton ] ) .",
    "this representation opens up the possibility of constructing an approximate projection scheme @xcite : performing the @xmath41-integration in saddlepoint approximation ( @xmath41spa ) , i.e.evaluating eq.([sproj ] ) at the stationary point of the grand canonical action @xmath59 , is equivalent to determining @xmath60 as a ( real ) thermodynamical chemical potential @xmath61 , fixing @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath41spa respects several of the exact properties discussed in sections 2.2 and 2.3 : ( 1 ) although the threshold property of the auxiliary spectral function no longer holds , their infrared powerlaw behavior is preserved . within nca ( section 3.1 )",
    "it can be shown explicitly that the @xmath41spa does not change the exponents @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and the same may be expected to hold for higher order self - consistent approximations ( section 3.3 ) .",
    "( 2 ) since the boson field is treated as a purely fluctuating field , bose condensation does not occur in the @xmath41spa .",
    "technically , this is achieved in that the boson spectral function @xmath63 , not restricted by the threshold property in this approximation , acquires weight at negative freqencies , which is negative because of the stability requirement @xmath64 for bosonic functions .",
    "the latter is seen in fig.[saddlep ] .",
    "obviously , the saddlepoint projection is immediately generalizable to lattice problems , since the _ average _ local charge @xmath65 and thus @xmath61 are space independent .",
    "the conserving formulation discussed in section 2.2 precludes mean field approximations which break the @xmath25 gauge symmetry , like slave boson mean field theory .",
    "although the latter can in some cases successfully describe the low @xmath4 behavior of models with a fl ground state , it leads to a spurious phase transition at finite @xmath4 and , in particular , fails to describe nfl systems .",
    "rather , the approximation should be generated from a luttinger - ward functional @xmath42 . using the hybridization @xmath2 as a small parameter",
    ", one may generate successively more complex approximations .",
    "the lowest order conserving approximation generated in this way is the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) @xcite , defined by the first diagram in fig .",
    "[ ctma ] , labeled `` nca '' . the nca is successful in describing anderson type models at temperatures above and around the kondo temperature @xmath5 , and even reproduces the threshold exponents eq .",
    "( [ alpha_fb2 ] ) for the nfl case of the anderson impurity model . however , it fails to describe the fl regime at low temperatures .",
    "this may be traced back to the failure to capture the spin - screened kondo singlet ground state of the model , since coherent spin flip scattering is not included in nca , as seen below .      in order to eliminate the shortcomings of the nca mentioned above",
    ", we may use as a guiding principle to look for contributions to the vertex functions which renormalize the auxiliary particle threshold exponents to their correct values , since this is a necessary condition for the description of fl and nfl behavior , as discussed in section 2.3 . as shown by power counting arguments @xcite , there are no corrections to the nca exponents in any finite order of perturbation theory .",
    "thus , any renormalization of the nca exponents must be due to singularities arising from an infinite resummation of terms .",
    "in general , the existence of collective excitations leads to a singular behavior of the corresponding two  particle vertex function . in view of the tendency of kondo systems to form a collective spin singlet state",
    ", we expect a singularity in the spin singlet channel of the pseudofermion",
    " conduction electron vertex function .",
    "it is then natural to perform a partial resummation of those contributions which , at each order in the hybridization @xmath2 , contain the maximum number of spin flip processes",
    ". this amounts to calculating the conduction electron ",
    "pseudofermion vertex function in the `` ladder '' or t - matrix approximation , @xmath66 , where the irreducible vertex is given by @xmath67 .",
    "the bethe  salpeter equation for @xmath66 reads ( fig .",
    "[ tmat ] ) , @xmath68where @xmath9 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 represent spin indices and @xmath20 a channel index .",
    "a similar integral equation holds for the charge fluctuation t - matrix @xmath72 ; it is obtained from @xmath66 by interchanging @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "inserting nca green s functions for the intermediate state propagators of eq .",
    "( [ cftmateq ] ) , we find at low temperatures and in the kondo regime @xmath75 a pole in the singlet channel of @xmath66 at an energy of the c - f pair which scales with @xmath5 , indicating the onset of spin singlet formation .      in order to find a gauge invariant approximation incorporation multiple spin flip processes as discussed in the previous section , we have to find the luttinger - ward functional , which by second functional derivation w.r.t .",
    "@xmath76 and @xmath44 or @xmath45 generates the @xmath4-matrices @xmath66 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "this generating functional @xmath42 is shown diagrammatically in fig.[ctma ] .",
    "the auxiliary particle self - energies are obtained in the conserving scheme as the functional derivatives of @xmath42 with respect to @xmath44 or @xmath45 , respectively ( eq .  ( [ fderiv ] ) ) , and are , in turn , nonlinear functionals of the full , renormalized auxiliary particle propagators .",
    "this defines a set of self - consistency equations , which we term conserving t - matrix approximation ( ctma ) .",
    "we have solved the ctma equations numerically for a wide range of impurity occupation numbers @xmath55 from the kondo to the empty impurity regime both for the single - channel and for the two - channel anderson model down to temperatures of the order of at least @xmath77 .",
    "the solution of the ctma equations forces the t - matrices to have vanishing spectral weight at negative com frequencies @xmath78 .",
    "indeed , the numerical evaluation shows that the poles of @xmath66 and @xmath72 are shifted to @xmath79 by self - consistency , where they merge with the continuous spectral weight present for @xmath80 , and thus renormalize the threshold exponents of the auxiliary spectral functions . for @xmath81 , @xmath6 the threshold exponents",

    "the good agreement of the ctma exponents with their exact values over the complete range of @xmath55 for the single  channel model and in the kondo regime of the multi ",
    "channel model may be taken as evidence that the t - matrix approximation correctly describes both the fl and the non  fl regimes of the su(n)@xmath8su(m ) anderson model ( n=2 , m=1,2,4 ) .",
    "the static spin susceptibility @xmath86 of the single- and of the two - channel anderson model in the kondo regime calculated within ctma as the derivative of the magnetization @xmath87 with respect to a magnetic field @xmath88 is shown in fig .",
    "good quantitative agreement with exact solutions is found for @xmath81 , @xmath6 ( fl ) . for @xmath81 , @xmath89 ( nfl ) ctma correctly reproduces the exact @xcite logarithmic temperature dependence below the kondo scale @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , the nca solution recovers the logarithmic behavior only far below @xmath5 .",
    "we have reviewed a novel technique to describe correlated quantum impurity systems with strong onsite repulsion , which is based on a conserving formulation of the auxiliary boson method .",
    "the conserving scheme allows to implement the conservation of the local charge @xmath29 without taking into account time dependent fluctuations of the gauge field @xmath41 . by including the leading infrared singular contributions ( spin flip and charge fluctuation processes ) , physical quantities , like the magnetic susceptibility",
