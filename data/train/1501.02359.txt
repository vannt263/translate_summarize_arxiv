    "the weak value amplification of the observables is finding increasing number of applications in the study of a variety of physical systems @xcite .",
    "although originally formulated for quantum systems , many past and current applications include applications to classical light beams .",
    "for example the first observation of the weak value amplification was in the context of a gaussian beam propagating through a birefringent medium @xcite .",
    "other important applications of weak value amplification include observation of spin hall effect of light @xcite , goos - hnchen shifts and various generalizations @xcite , angular shifts of light beams @xcite , enhancement of interferometric results @xcite .",
    "weak value amplification has been used to measure the state of polarization of light beam on poincare sphere using optical vortex beams @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing that a concept formulated for quantum systems has so many profound applications in the context of classical light beams .",
    "aiello showed in a formal way how weak value amplification works for beams of light @xcite .",
    "lundeen and coworkers used weak value amplification to get the wavefront of a single photon @xcite .",
    "steinberg @xcite proposed the applications in the measurement of interaction between two fermions .",
    "weak value amplification has been proposed to measure the presence of an additional charge in ahranov bohm interferometer @xcite .",
    "experimentally determined weak values for a single photon s polarization via a weak value amplification @xcite .",
    "starling et .",
    "al . used the weak value amplification to enhance frequency shift resolution in a sagnac interferometer @xcite .",
    "while most examine the amplification of the small shifts , several have examined the question of improvement in sensitivity @xcite of the measurement .",
    "the weak value amplification can worsen the metrological performance @xcite for example the technical noise or decoherence can not be completely overcome @xcite although a significant improvement can be obtained @xcite .",
    "an optimal strategy would be to retain full data @xcite and do a weak measurement .",
    "however advantages of this technique are not exclusive to this technique @xcite .    in this paper we show the great advantage offered by weak value amplification for studying quantum mechanical cat states for atoms .",
    "the cat states are the linear superposition of two coherent states on the bloch sphere @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent the probability amplitudes for the atomic system to be in the atomic coherent states @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the quantum interferences in cat state are most prominent if the two coherent states are close on the bloch sphere @xcite .",
    "the study of quantum interferences is greatly aided by the weak value amplification otherwise these are difficult to observe .",
    "the weak value amplification gives us the capability to resolve two close lying coherent states .",
    "we look at the interaction of a single photon with an ensemble of atoms prepared in a coherent state @xcite .",
    "the interaction produces an entangled state of the photon polarization variables with the coherent states of the atomic ensemble .",
    "we use preselection and postselection of the polarization states of the photon .",
    "the postselected polarization is nearly orthogonal to the input polarization .",
    "this enables us to magnify the weak values associated with the measurements of the phase @xmath5 .",
    "although in our work we produce cat states by heralding i.e. by detection of a photon , there are many methods to produce cat states @xcite .",
    "the most prominent method is to use atomic systems dispersively interacting with a cavity field @xcite .",
    "the importance of cat states in quantum optics hardly needs to be emphasized as these have important nonclassical properties @xcite and are important in precision measurements @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the model of the interacting atom - field system . in section 3",
    ", we make a weak value amplification on the atom - field system so that the post - selected atomic cat state is generated . in section 4 ,",
    "we present the variation of the wigner distribution of the post - selected atomic cat state when the overlap of the initial and final states of the field changes . in section 5 ,",
    "we show that the small phase shift in the post - selected atomic cat state can be amplified by choosing nearly orthogonal pre - selection and post - selection of the single photon field . in this section",
    "we also discuss how the state tomography of the post - selected cat state can be done . in section 6 ,",
    "we discuss the weak value amplification for our atomic cat states using the quantum fisher information and show that the fisher information in the meter and the classical fisher information yields the quantum fisher information of the full meter system state .",
    "this is in agreement with recent conclusions in several papers @xcite .",
    "we conclude our paper in the final section .",
    "we consider an ensemble of @xmath0 identical two - level atoms interacting with two orthogonally polarized modes of a single photon field with frequency @xmath6 denoted by creation ( annihilation ) operators @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "the two - level atoms have degenerate ground states @xmath11 and excited states @xmath12 , separated by an energy of @xmath13 .",
    "according to the angular - momentum selection rules , the transitions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are forbidden , only the transitions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are allowed .",
    "moreover , the levels @xmath18 and @xmath19 are coupled by the field mode @xmath9 , and the levels @xmath20 and @xmath21 are coupled by the field mode @xmath10 .",
    "their coupling strengthes are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian of the combined system of the atoms and the field @xcite takes the form    @xmath24    in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , the first two terms are the atomic excitation hamiltonian , the third term is the free field hamiltonian , the last two terms are the atom - field interaction hamiltonian . in the dispersive limit in which the detuning between the atomic transitions and the field modes is much larger than the atom - field coupling strengthes i.e. , @xmath25 , the hamiltonian equation ( [ 2 ] ) can be reduced to @xmath26 note that there are no couplings between the ground states @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) and the excited ones . for simplicity , we assume that the coupling strengths have identical amplitudes @xmath29 . if one starts from the initial ground state , the relevant interaction hamiltonian between the atoms and the field modes is written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the field operator , @xmath32 is the collective atomic operator , and @xmath33 is the coupling constant between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "another important example of optical transitions leading to the interaction hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) would be three level atoms @xcite with ground levels @xmath36 coupled to an excited state @xmath37 by a far off resonant field , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . under the assumption that the frequency separation between @xmath36 is such that the two photon raman coupling between @xmath38 and @xmath39 is negligible ,",
    "the effective interaction between the atoms and the field is described by eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "in what follows we assume that the initial state of the atomic sample is an atomic coherent state @xmath40 with a definite angular momentum value @xmath41 , which can be created by rotating the ground state @xmath42 on a bloch sphere by an angle @xmath43 around an axis defined as @xmath44 @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 indicates a state for which all atoms are in the ground state .",
    "the atomic coherent state also can be expressed as @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the simultaneous eigenstate of @xmath54 and @xmath35 , @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath0 is a total number of atoms in the sample .",
    "the atomic coherent states are in general not orthogonal except for antipodal points .",
    "the modulus squared of the inner product of two atomic coherent states is @xmath58 is the angle between the directions @xmath59 and @xmath60 on the bloch sphere , and @xmath61 .",
    "for the special cases ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ; or @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , the two atomic coherent states are orthogonal .",
    "the atomic coherent states can be produced by classical driving fields of constant amplitude @xcite .",
    "we assume that the initial state of the single photon field is given by @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the probability amplitudes to find the light in the states @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively , and @xmath73 .",
    "note that the @xmath74 corresponds to an elliptically polarized light . when @xmath75 or @xmath76 , the @xmath74 is circularly polarized .",
    "when @xmath77 , the light is @xmath78 polarized .",
    "note that single photons can be heralded @xcite or a single nitrogen - vacancy color center in a diamond nanocrystal @xcite .",
    "thus the initial state of atom - field system is @xmath79 , which is a product state of the two subsystems of the field and the atomic ensemble .",
    "we next study the evolution of the system under the interaction ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "this is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the atom - field interaction time .",
    "expression ( [ 12 ] ) indicates that the atoms are entangled with the single photon field due to the atom - field coupling .",
    "the two coherent states in ( [ 12 ] ) differ in phase by @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "the interaction of the single photon with the medium is expected to be weak and hence @xmath84 is small .",
    "thus the question of distinguishing between two such coherent states arises .",
    "it is here that the weak value amplification offers great advantage .",
    "we make a preselection and postselection of the states of the polarization of the single photon . for simplicity",
    "we assume that initially the field is linearly polarized with @xmath85 i.e. , @xmath86 .",
    "we take the post - selected polarization state as @xmath87 in which @xmath88 is a small angle , and is controlled by the polarizer .",
    "hence the overlap between the pre - selected and post - selected states of the field is @xmath89 which depends on the parameter @xmath88 .",
    "when @xmath90 , @xmath91 , the pre - selected and post - selected states of the field are orthogonal . for small @xmath88 , the pre and post - selected states are nearly orthogonal .",
    "after the weak interaction between the atoms and the field , we project the state of the system @xmath92 onto a final state of the single photon field @xmath93 , we obtain the normalized atomic schrdinger cat state @xmath94,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a superposition of two distinct atomic coherent states @xmath95 and @xmath96 rotating in opposite directions in phase space .",
    "thus the weak interaction of the atoms with the single photon field , followed by the state - selective measurement on the single photon field , has transformed the initial atomic coherent state @xmath40 into a post - selected atomic cat state with two components @xmath95 and @xmath96 with small opposite phase shifts @xmath84 . here",
    "@xmath97 is the normalization factor given by @xmath98.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in what follows we study the post - selected state for @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "this lies in the equatorial plane and has maximum coherence . in spin language",
    "this means that the spin is @xmath78 polarized at @xmath101 .",
    "in this section , we use the wigner function to quantify the nonclassicality of the post - selected atomic cat state .",
    "the wigner function of the atomic cat state is defined as @xcite @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the state - multipole operators @xcite , @xmath104 is the wigner @xmath105 symbol , @xmath106 is an integer taking values 0 , 1 , 2 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 is the spherical harmonic .",
    "it can be interpreted as a quasiprobability distribution in phase space .",
    "it satisfies the normalization condition @xmath111    after some calculations , we obtain the following result for the wigner function @xmath112(-1)^{j - m'}(2k+1)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}j & k & j\\\\ -m ' & q & m'-q\\end{array}\\right)^{*}\\left(\\begin{array}{c}2j\\\\j+m'-q\\\\\\end{array}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}y_{kq}(\\alpha,\\beta)\\bigg\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which the first term and the second term correspond to the contributions of the individual coherent states @xmath113 and @xmath114 in the atomic cat state , respectively , the last term represents the interference between the two atomic coherent states .",
    "+    we now demonstrate the importance of the weak value amplification and postselections in discriminating two coherent states lying nearby . for illustration purpose",
    "we choose the small phase shift @xmath115 and the total number of the atoms @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "the wigner function for the atomic cat state on the bloch sphere for several different post - selected values of @xmath88 is plotted in fig .",
    "we notice that the post - selected state for @xmath118 can be hardly distinguished from the initial state .",
    "the post selection is useful here .",
    "we show the wigner functions of several post - selected states by choosing @xmath88 values such that the pre - selected and post - selected polarization states are nearly orthogonal .",
    "for decreasing values of @xmath88 one sees more and more negative regions in the wigner function signifying that the post - selected state becomes more and more nonclassical .",
    "the wigner function can be determined by tomographic reconstruction @xcite .",
    "in this section , we show that how the small phase shift @xmath84 in the post - selected atomic cat state induced by the weak interaction of the atomic sample with the single photon field can be measured by studying the phase distribution of the atomic cat state .",
    "the phase distribution @xmath119 for the atomic cat state @xcite , i.e. , the probability distribution @xmath119 of finding the system in the state @xmath120 , is given by @xmath121 the figure  [ fig3 ] shows that the phase distribution @xmath119 as a function of @xmath5 for different values of @xmath88 for @xmath122 and @xmath117 . as the value of @xmath88",
    "is decreased from @xmath123 to @xmath124 , the phase distribution @xmath119 gradually changes from a single peak at @xmath125 to two symmetric peaks with a dip at @xmath125 , which is due to the destructive interference between two weakly separated coherent states in the atomic cat state .",
    "the scaled left peak shift @xmath126 from @xmath125 as a function of @xmath88 is shown in fig .",
    "it is noted that the scaled peak shift @xmath126 increases with decreasing @xmath88 . when @xmath127 , @xmath128 , the amplification factor for the weak value @xmath84 is about 15 .",

    "is decreased , the scaled left peak shift @xmath126 increases . when @xmath127 , @xmath130 , the amplification factor for the weak value @xmath84 is about 5.8 .",
    "note that the amplification factor for the weak value @xmath84 decreases with increasing the total number @xmath0 of the atoms .",
    "this is because the modulus squared of the overlap of the two atomic coherent states @xmath113 and @xmath114 decreases when the total number @xmath0 of the atoms becomes larger , which is shown below . using eq .",

    "the best way to study this cat state is via the distributions of the spin variables .",
    "note that the basic interaction ( [ 4 ] ) produced the heralded cat state ( [ 15 ] ) by using a single photon .",
    "now imagine that after heralding a second classical field with linear polarization is sent through the ensemble , then the polarization of the classical field will be rotated .",
    "this rotation of polarization will depend on the quantum variable @xmath35 .",
    "thus the studies in the fluctuations of the polarization of the classical field applied after initial heralding will measure the quantum characteristics of the cat state .",
    "such techniques were initially pioneered by julsgaard et .",
    "al . @xcite and",
    "more recently applied to heralded cat states by mcconnell et .",

    "<S> we show the utility of the weak value amplification to observe the quantum interference between two close lying atomic coherent states in a post - selected atomic cat state , produced in a system of @xmath0 identical two - level atoms weakly interacting with a single photon field . through the observation of the negative parts of the wigner distribution of the post - selected atomic cat state , we find that the post - selected atomic cat state becomes more nonclassical when the post - selected polarization state of the single photon field tends toward becoming orthogonal to its pre - selected state . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the small phase shift in the post - selected atomic cat state can be amplified via measuring the peak shift of its phase distribution when the post - selected state of the single photon field is nearly orthogonal to its pre - selected state . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the amplification factor of 15 [ 5 ] can be obtained for a sample of 10 [ 100 ] atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this effectively provides us with a method to discriminate two close lying states on the bloch sphere . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible experimental implementation of the scheme , and conclude with a discussion of the fisher information . </S>",
