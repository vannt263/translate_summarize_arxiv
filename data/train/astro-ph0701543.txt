    "ionized x - ray absorbers ( _ warm absorbers _ : was ) have been observed in the spectra of @xmath0 % of seyfert 1s ( e.g. crenshaw , kraemer & george 2003 ) and quasars ( piconcelli et al . 2005 ) .",
    "such high detection rates , combined with evidence for transverse flows ( mathur et al .",
    "1995 ; crenshaw , kraemer & george 2003 ) suggest that was are actually ubiquitous in agn , but become directly visible in absorption only when our line of sight crosses the outflowing material . despite their ubiquity , very little is still know about their physical state , dynamical strength and geometry .",
    "the most fundamental question is where do quasar winds originate ?",
    "addressing this question requires the independent determination of a quantity which is not directly observable : the electron density @xmath1 of the outflowing material .",
    "recent studies have mostly shown that was are made up of just a few distinct physical components ( e.g. krongold et al . , 2007 - k07 - and references therein ) . however , for each of these components , only average estimates of the product @xmath2 could be derived , from time - averaged spectral analyses .",
    "this is due to the intrinsic degeneracy of @xmath1 and @xmath3 in the equation that defines the two observables : the ionization parameter of the gas @xmath4 and the luminosity of ionizing photons @xmath5 .",
    "an unambiguous method to remove this degeneracy is to monitor the response of the ionization state of the gas in the wind to changes of the ionizing continuum ( krolik & kriss 1995 ; nicastro et al .",
    "1999 : hereinafter n99 ) .",
    "time - evolving photoionization equations define the photoionization equilibrium time scale , @xmath6 , that measures the time necessary for the gas to reach photoionization equilibrium with the ionizing continuum ( n99 ) .",
    "this time - scale depends explicitly on the electron density @xmath1 in the cloud , during both increasing and decreasing ionizing continuum phases ( n99 ) .",
    "non - equilibrium photoionization models can therefore be used to measure the density of the gas @xmath1 and , hence , its distance from the ionizing source .    here",
    ", we apply this technique to a high s / n xmm-_newton _ observation of the low luminosity ( @xmath7 , ogle et al .",
    "2004 ) , low black hole mass ( m@xmath8 m@xmath9 , peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) , and rapidly ( @xmath10 1 hour ) and highly ( factor of @xmath11 , mchardy et al .",
    "2004 ) x - ray variable narrow line seyfert 1 ngc  4051 .",
    "ngc 4051 was observed for @xmath10117 ks with the xmm - newton observatory , on 2001 may 16 - 17 . the source varied by a factor of a few on timescales as short as 1  ks , and by a factor of @xmath1012 from minimum to maximum flux over the whole observation ( fig .",
    "details of the data reduction and analysis can be found in k07 .",
    "two physically distinct but dynamically coincident ( @xmath12 km s@xmath13 ) wa phases were found in the average rgs spectrum of ngc  4051 : a high- and a low - ionization phase ( hip and lip ) .",
    "to study the response of the was of ngc  4051 to ionizing flux changes , we performed a time - resolved spectral analysis of 21 epic - pn spectra extracted from 21 distinct continuum levels ( _ a - u _ , see fig .",
    "for both absorbing components the derived @xmath14 values follow closely the source continuum lightcurve [ compare panel ( c ) and ( d ) with panel ( b ) of fig . 1 ] , clearly indicating that the gas is responding quickly to the changes in the ionizing continuum .    to study more quantitatively how these changes are related to the changes in the continuum , we show in fig .",
    "2a , b the log of the source count rate ( log@xmath15 ) vs. log@xmath16 , for the hip [ panel ( a ) ] and the lip [ panel ( b ) ] . for most of the points of the hip and for all the points of the lip ( within 2@xmath17 ) , log@xmath15 correlates with log@xmath16",
    "tightly , which allows us to derive robust estimates of the quantity ( @xmath18 ) for both components ( best fit lines in fig .",
    "2a , b , table 1 ) .",
    "2a , b shows that the lip is always in photoionization equilibrium with the ionizing flux , while the hip deviates from photoionization equilibrium during periods of extreme flux states . unlike the lip ,",
    "then ( for which only an upper limit on @xmath6 , and so a lower limit on @xmath1 , can be estimated ) , the behavior of the hip allows us to set both lower and upper limits on @xmath19 , and so on @xmath20 .",
    ".physical and dynamical parameters of hip and lip of ngc  4051 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "from these independent estimates of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we can derive limits on @xmath3 and so evaluate all physical and dynamical parameters of the gas , including the mass outflow rate .",
    "table 1 summarizes our findings .",
    "3 shows a schematic view of the location of the ionized outflow in ngc  4051 .",
    "we find that :          \\(4 ) a static spherical configuration for the was of ngc  4051 is ruled out , and a dynamical but stationary spherical configuration ( i.e. expulsion of thin spherical shells at regular time intervals ) is highly unlikely , since it requires extremely fine tuning not to degenerate in a radial continuous flow ;    \\(5 ) the next simplest geometrical configuration , for the was of ngc  4051 , is that of geometrically thin cone sections , originating in the accretion disk at a distance consistent with that of the high - ionization blrs ( fig .",
    "3 ; elvis , 2000 ) ;    \\(6 ) if this configuration applies to all agn , then the presence or absence of was in the x - ray spectra of type 1 agns is explained simply by orientation , with was being visible only in those objects seen between edge - on and an angle equal to the disk - outflow angle ;    \\(7 ) the by - conical configuration is consistent with all our findings and provides reasonable values for the mass outflow rates of the wa of ngc  4051 , relative to the source accretion rate : @xmath21% @xmath22 ( table 1 ) ;      finally , we note that a radial extension of disk winds toward larger disk radii , could produce cold absorption , as seen in type 2 agns ( risaliti , elvis & nicastro , 2002 ) : in such objects was would be masked by the cold absorption , but the ionized wind would still shine in x - rays and could produce the photoionized x - ray cones observed in several seyfert 2s ( guainazzi , this conference ) .",
