    "the classification of various continuous phase transitions has been successfully discussed from the viewpoint of the landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) paradigm  @xcite .",
    "the essential principles of the paradigm are the clarification of ( local ) order parameters and the characterization of breaking symmetries .",
    "recently , the possibility of deconfined critical phenomena ( dcp )  @xcite has attracted considerable attention as a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) beyond the lgw paradigm .",
    "dcp have been predicted to occur at the qpt point between a magnetically ordered phase , such as the nel phase , and the valence - bond solid ( vbs ) phase in two dimensional ( 2d ) systems .",
    "remarkably , this phase transition is continuous , although the symmetry group in one phase is not the subset of another phase .",
    "the well - known models that are expected to exhibit dcp are the generalized heisenberg models with multibody interactions for su(n ) spins namely , su(n ) @xmath6 models  @xcite .",
    "considerable effort has been expended to numerically determine whether the qpt of this model family is of the second order or weak first order , however , a satisfactory result has not yet been obtained  @xcite .",
    "an interesting aspect of dcp is that the transition may occur independently of the lattice geometry  @xcite . in a previous study  @xcite",
    ", we evaluated the critical exponent , @xmath7 , at the qpt point between the nel and vbs phase in su(n ) @xmath6 models on both square and honeycomb lattices using quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations . from the finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis , we confirmed that @xmath7 is independent of the lattice geometry but depends on the su(n ) symmetry .",
    "this result strongly suggested the presence of dcp in the su(n ) @xmath6 models .",
    "however , @xmath7 for the su(3 ) models exhibits a systematic shift toward the trivial value of @xmath8 as the system size increases .",
    "therefore , the possibility of a first - order transition remains in the case of su(3 ) .",
    "the nature of the qpt point is important in the discussion of finite - temperature properties , because it can strongly affect the topology of the thermal phase diagram and also the criticality , as shown in fig .",
    "the su(n ) @xmath6 models are expected to exhibit a thermal phase transition if the vbs pattern is characterized by spontaneous symmetry breaking of the lattice . thus , consideration of the critical properties of thermal transitions in the vicinity of the qpt point may yield a different perspective on the possibility of dcp occurring in su(n ) @xmath6 models .",
    "the universality class of the thermal transition has been discussed for both su(2 ) @xmath9  @xcite and @xmath10  @xcite models on the square lattice .",
    "the vbs pattern on the square lattice is described by a columnar dimer configuration , which is characterized by the spontaneous breaking of @xmath11-rotational symmetry around the center of the plaquette .",
    "thus , the @xmath1 symmetry breaking of the vbs order parameter is expected at the critical temperature . in the 2d case ,",
    "several models that exhibit @xmath1 symmetry breaking exist , such as the ashkin - teller model  @xcite including the 4-state potts model  @xcite and the 2d classical xy spin model with the @xmath1 field ( xy+@xmath1 model ) . in such models , the critical exponent",
    ", @xmath3 , always satisfies the condition @xmath12 .",
    "however , the observed exponent @xmath13 of the su(2 ) @xmath9 model differs from the expected value  @xcite . in the su(2 ) @xmath9 model , the vbs order is very weak because the qpt point is located in the vicinity of the limit , and the model can only be expressed using the multibody interacting @xmath14 term ( the dimer limit ) . to enhance the vbs order , jin et al .",
    "have focused on the su(2 ) @xmath10 models  @xcite .",
    "the qmc results they have obtained  @xcite indicate that the criticality is well explained by the gaussian conformal - field theory with central charge @xmath15 ; the thermal exponent , @xmath2 , monotonically increases as the system approaches the qpt point , while the following relations between the exponents , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , are retained .",
    "this is a characteristic aspect of the 2d weak ising universality class  @xcite , and the same behavior has also been observed in the 2d xy+@xmath1 model  @xcite . in the case of the classical spin model ,",
    "@xmath2 monotonically increases as the @xmath1 symmetry - breaking field , @xmath18 , is suppressed and finally diverges at the xy limit , where the kosterliz - thouless ( kt ) transition takes place .",
    "the authors in ref . @xcite have observed that an enhancement of the u(1 ) symmetry of the vbs order parameter is observed at close proximity to the transition temperature and the qpt point , when the system size is smaller than a characteristic length scale . since it has been noted that the emergence of additional u(1 ) symmetry is an important signature of dcp  @xcite , the numerical result in ref .",
    "@xcite is consistent with the presence of a deconfined critical point in the su(2 ) @xmath10 model .",
    "however , the observation of u(1 ) symmetry in the vicinity of the qpt point seems to be natural , because the @xmath1 field in the classical model is always marginal at a transition temperature and the system becomes the pure xy model at the @xmath19 limit  @xcite .",
    "thus , the emergence of u(1 ) symmetry can not be regarded as sufficient evidence for the presence of a deconfined critical point in this case . since the possibility of a first - order transition",
    "has been suggested in su(3 ) @xmath9 model case  @xcite , where the same @xmath1 field is broken , systematic studies of su(n ) symmetry are necessary .",
    "in contrast to the square - lattice case , the nature of the symmetry - breaking field is different for the honeycomb - lattice case .",
    "when the columnar vbs pattern is characterized by @xmath20 rotational symmetry breaking , the corresponding classical model is expected to be the xy+@xmath5 model .",
    "since the @xmath5 field is relevant in two dimensions , the universality class is explained by the 2d three - state potts model  @xcite , and the emergence of the u(1 ) symmetry in the vbs order parameter may then be suppressed in the vicinity of the qpt .",
    "although this is correct in the case of su(2 ) spins , the higher su(n)-symmetric case seems to be controversial .",
    "the discussion of dcp is based on the noncompact complex projective ( nccp@xmath21 ) theory with @xmath22 symmetry - breaking fields  @xcite . in this theory , although the @xmath5 symmetry - breaking fields is relevant , it becomes irrelevant as n increases  @xcite .",
    "for the su(2 ) case , which corresponds to the nccp@xmath23 theory , recent qmc results have indicated that the @xmath5 field is @xmath24 but almost marginal at the qpt  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can expect the first - order transition at the qpt point in the su(2 ) case and a change of criticality as n increases .",
    "this indicates that the criticality of the thermal transitions and the topology of the phase diagram are determined base on the order of the qpt . if the qpt is continuous , as is expected for larger values of n , and the system approaches the qpt , whether or not the universality classes of the thermal transition are affected is a nontrivial question .",
    "our previous qmc calculations suggest that the same criticality exists at the qpt regardless of the lattice geometry  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the phase diagram topologies are identical in both the square- and the honeycomb - lattice cases .",
    "if one focuses on the most likely and simplest case , two scenarios for the thermal phase diagram can be expected depending on the order of the qpt point : ( a ) the qpt transition is of the second order and the thermal transition is always continuous ( fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) ) ; and ( b ) the qpt is a weak first - order transition and the multicritical point exists at a finite temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) ) .",
    "when scenario ( b ) occurs , we expect to observe crossover behavior and for @xmath2 to change to the trivial value , @xmath25 . from the above discussion",
    ", the importance of calculating the thermal phase diagram for different values of n and various lattice geometries with high accuracy is apparent .",
    "further , such calculations can allow us to consider the possibility of the dcp scenario in the su(n ) @xmath6 models .",
    "thus , in this paper , we systematically study the thermal phase transitions of the @xmath9 model on the square lattice and the @xmath10 model on the honeycomb lattice for su(3 ) and su(4 ) spins .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "<S> , a thermal phase transition occurs that is accompanied by rotational symmetry breaking of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we perform quantum monte carlo calculations in order to clarify the critical properties of the models . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated critical exponents indicate that the universality classes of the square- and honeycomb - lattice cases are identical to those of the classical @xmath0 model with a @xmath1 symmetry - breaking field and the 3-state potts model , respectively . in the square - lattice case , </S>",
    "<S> the thermal exponent , @xmath2 , monotonically increases as the system approaches the quantum critical point , while the values of the critical exponents , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , remain constant . from a finite - size scaling analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the system exhibits weak universality , because the @xmath1 symmetry - breaking field is always marginal . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , @xmath2 in the honeycomb - lattice case exhibits a constant value , even in the vicinity of the quantum critical point , because the @xmath5 field remains relevant in the su(3 ) and su(4 ) cases . </S>"
