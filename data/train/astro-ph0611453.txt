    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "as we do for the @xmath2-based rlf , we use two criteria to define radio - loud quasars : @xmath72 ( luminosity density at rest - frame 6 cm ) @xmath73 ergs s@xmath18 hz@xmath18 and @xmath74 ergs s@xmath18 hz@xmath18 . in the two cases ,",
    "first is able to detect radio - loud quasars up to @xmath75 and 3.5 , respectively .",
    "we model the rlf using equation  [ eq : fracrl ] and repeat the analysis .",
    "the best fitting results are shown in table 1 , and figures 4 and 6 .",
    "the rlf based on @xmath72 is correlated with @xmath57 and @xmath4 in the same manner as the @xmath2-based criteria .",
    "when applying the k corrections , we assumed that the slope of the radio continuum is @xmath36 and used a model spectrum to determine the optical continuum slope . to investigate the effect of the k corrections",
    ", we performed several experiments .",
    "first , for a given quasar at @xmath57 , we calculated its @xmath37 and @xmath4 from the magnitude in the sdss band whose effective wavelength is closest to @xmath76  assuming a slope of @xmath36 ( test 1 ) . as before , we corrected for the contribution from emission lines . because the sdss @xmath21 photometry covers a wavelength range of 3000 to 10,000  , the k corrections for @xmath71 require no extrapolation .",
    "second , we assumed two extreme cases for the radio and optical slopes : in test 2 , we took the optical slope to be 0.0 and the radio slope as @xmath77 , while in test 3 , the optical slope was @xmath77 and the radio slope was 0.0 .",
    "the results of the fit to equation  [ eq : fracrl ] are listed in table 1 .",
    "the values of @xmath5 and @xmath60 recalculated under these tests differ by less than 2@xmath48 from the original values , and the null hypothesis that @xmath65 and @xmath66 is rejected at @xmath67 significance in all these tests .",
    "therefore the effect of the k corrections on our conclusions is small .",
    "we investigated the reliability of the relation described by equation  [ eq : fracrl ] for different definitions of radio loudness and for luminosities in different optical bands .",
    "for example , we defined the @xmath2 parameter as the rest - frame ratio of the flux density at 6 cm to the flux density at 4400  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) instead of 2500  , and we repeated the analysis in @xmath153 ( test 4 ) . in test 5 , we determined the rlf as a function of @xmath57 and @xmath78 ( instead of @xmath4 ) .",
    "@xmath78 is the absolute magnitude in the rest - frame @xmath79 band , and was calculated using the method described in @xmath153 .",
    "the results are listed in table 1 . in these cases",
    "the rlf is still strongly dependent on redshift and luminosity , and the relation described by equation  [ eq : fracrl ] is not sensitive to the details of how radio loudness is defined .",
    "when examining the dependence of the rlf on @xmath4 and @xmath57 , we note that contours of constant rlf in figure 2 roughly coincide with contours of constant apparent magnitude .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 7(a ) , which shows that for different redshift bins , the relation between the rlf and _ apparent i magnitude _ is independent of redshift at @xmath80 .",
    "the rlf does decrease with redshift at @xmath81 , although with large error bars .",
    "this `` conspiracy '' of strong dependence of the rlf on apparent magnitude raises the concern that our results have been affected by flux - dependent selection effects . in this paper",
    "we are considering the rlf for optically - selected quasars , and the sdss color selection is highly complete at @xmath82 @xcite , so optical selection effects are not likely to seriously affect the rlf determination .",
    "however , the sdss quasar selection becomes increasingly incomplete for objects with very red intrinsic colors ( @xmath83 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , especially at high redshift .",
    "@xcite found a strong correlation between radio loudness and optical color using the sdss sample .",
    "we reproduce this dependence in the upper panel of figure 8",
    ". the rlf rises with increasing @xmath84 , which is the difference between the observed @xmath85 and the median @xmath85 color of quasars at that redshift , following @xcite . to examine whether this rlf - color dependence affects the relation in equation  [ eq : fracrl ]",
    ", we divide the quasar sample into several @xmath84 bins , and calculate the rlf as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath57 for each bin of _ intrinsic _ quasar colors .",
    "we find that although the average rlf increases toward redder continuum , the rlf is still a strong function of @xmath4 and @xmath57 within each bin , similar to the relation shown in equation  [ eq : fracrl ] .",
    "the lower panel of figure 8 gives an example for the bin of @xmath86 .",
    "note that more than 80% of the quasars in the sample lie in the range of @xmath87 , within which the rlf - color relation is relatively flat .",
    "therefore , although we can not determine accurately the rlf evolution for the reddest few percent of quasars where sdss is incomplete , the strong correlation between the rlf and both redshift and luminosity is not strongly affected by the rlf - color relation over the color range in which the sdss selection is essentially complete .    in order to examine radio selection effects , we performed the following tests .    1 .",
    "did we miss fr1 quasars due to the 5@xmath32 radio catalog matching ?",
    "we used a 10@xmath32 matching instead , and found that the number of fr1 quasars increases by only 3.7% .",
    "we also found that these additional sources increase the rlf by similar factors at both high and low redshift and both high and low luminosity , and thus have little effect on @xmath5 or @xmath60 .",
    "2 .   did we measure the radio fluxes of fr2 quasars correctly ?",
    "we compared first with the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has a resolution of 45@xmath32 .",
    "the first and nvss fluxes of most fr2 quasars are in good agreement .",
    "first has a resolution of 5@xmath32 and may overresolve radio sources larger than about 10@xmath32 .",
    "these sources are rare and very bright in radio ( usually @xmath88 mjy ) , well above the radio - loud division in our analysis .",
    "3 .   were there quasars detected by nvss but not by first ?",
    "we matched our sample to the nvss catalog within 15@xmath32 .",
    "we found that about 6% of the matched quasars were not detected by first , and 80% of these additional sources are fr1 sources with offsets more than 5@xmath32 from the sdss positions .",
    "they increase the rlf by similar factors at both high and low redshift and both high and low luminosity , and thus do not significantly change the trend in the rlf .",
    "4 .   how did the incompleteness of first at the detection limit affect our results ?",
    "in section 3 we use 1.1 mjy as the first detection limit , and we correct for the incompleteness caused by the resolution effect . here",
    "we set two tests to examine the incompleteness near the first limit .",
    "in test 6 we use a limit of 1.5 mjy ( the corresponding @xmath89 ) to determine the rlf for @xmath7 ; while in test 7 we use a limit of 3 mjy ( the corresponding @xmath90 ) to calculate the rlf for @xmath91 . note that the first completeness measured from the completeness curve in figure 1 is 75% at 1.5 mjy and 95% at 3 mjy .",
    "the results of the tests are given in table 1 , and they show the similar trend of the rlf on redshift and optical luminosity as we obtained above .    therefore , based on these tests we conclude that the strong dependence of the rlf on @xmath4 and @xmath57 is highly likely to be physical , and the radio incompleteness and selection effects we have considered are not responsible for the dependence , though we can not rule out other unexplored selection effects .",
    "most of the previous studies of the rlf are based on samples of tens to hundreds of quasars . considering that the rlf is only @xmath92% on average , these samples are not large enough to study the two - dimensional distribution of the rlf on @xmath4 and @xmath57 .",
    "this makes it difficult to uncover the relation of equation  [ eq : fracrl ] using only the marginal distribution of the rlf .",
    "we calculate the marginal rlf as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath57 for our sample , which is shown in figures 7(b ) and 7(c ) .",
    "one can see the marginal rlf is roughly independent of both @xmath4 and @xmath57 , because the dependence on @xmath4 and @xmath57 roughly cancel out due to the @xmath4@xmath57 degeneracy .",
    "this result is in quantitative agreement with the marginal rlf derived by @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that high - redshift quasars show little difference in their rest - frame uv / optical and x - ray properties from those of low - redshift quasars .",
    "their emission - line strengths and uv continuum shapes are very similar to those of low - redshift quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the emission line ratios indicate solar or supersolar metallicity in emission - line regions as found in low - redshift quasars ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the optical - to - x - ray flux ratios and x - ray continuum shapes show little evolution with redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these measurements suggest that most quasar properties are not sensitive to the cosmic age .",
    "however , figure 2 shows that the rlf evolves strongly with redshift , thus the evolution of the rlf places important constraints on models of quasar evolution and the radio emission mechanism .",
    "equation  [ eq : fracrl ] implies a strong correlation between the rlf and optical luminosity . using a large sample of low - redshift ( @xmath93 ) agns , @xcite find that radio - loud agns tend to reside in old , massive galaxies , and that the fraction of radio - loud agns is a strong function of stellar mass or central black hole mass ( e.g. , the fraction increases from zero at a stellar mass of @xmath94m@xmath95 to 30% at a stellar mass of @xmath96m@xmath95 ) . assuming that optical luminosity is roughly proportional to black hole mass @xcite , their radio - loud fraction of agns is also a strong function of optical luminosity .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with equation  [ eq : fracrl ] , although our quasars are more luminous than their low - redshift agns .",
    "equation  [ eq : fracrl ] also shows that the rlf is a strong function of redshift . by stacking first images of sdss - selected quasars",
    ", @xcite recently found that the median @xmath2 is a declining function with optical luminosity . after correcting for this effect",
    ", they claimed that the median @xmath2 is independent on redshift , which seems inconsistent with our result that the rlf is a strong negative function of redshift .",
    "however , the median @xmath2 and the rlf are not identical .",
    "the median @xmath2 is determined by the majority of quasars with low @xmath2 values ( i.e. radio - quiet quasars ) ; while the rlf is the fraction of quasars exceeding a threshold in @xmath2 , and therefore corresponds to the behavior of the small fraction of quasars with high @xmath2 values ( i.e. radio - loud quasars ) .",
    "there are two natural ways to interpret the evolution of the rlf with redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : ( 1 ) this may be due to the cosmological evolution of quasar radio properties , such as @xmath2 and @xmath72 .",
    "for instance , a decreasing @xmath2 results in a decreasing rlf for increasing redshift .",
    "( 2 ) this could be simply caused by the density evolution of different populations of quasars ( e.g. radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars ) .",
    "the results of @xcite may have ruled out the first explanation and leave the second one : the different density evolution behaviors for the two classes of quasars .",
    "for instance , there are more radio - loud quasars at low redshift , but the fraction of radio - loud quasars is small , so they do not change the median @xmath2 , which is still dominated by radio - quiet quasars .",
    "this claim is based on stacked first images . to distinguish between the two explanations",
    ", one needs to determine the radio luminosity function of quasars in different redshift ranges , including the radio - quiet population , going to radio fluxes much fainter than those probed by first .",
    "deep surveys such as the cosmic evolution survey @xcite that cover a wide redshift range and reach low luminosity in both optical and radio wavelengths are needed to interpret the evolution of the rlf .",
    "in this paper we use a sample of more than 30,000 optically - selected quasars from sdss to determine the rlf of quasars as a function of redshift and optical luminosity .",
    "the sample covers a large range of redshift and luminosity .",
    "we study the rlf using different criteria to define radio - loud quasars . after breaking the degeneracy between redshift and luminosity",
    ", we find that the rlf is a strong function of both redshift and optical luminosity : the rlf decreases rapidly with increasing redshift and decreasing luminosity .",
    "the relation can be described by a simple model , given by equation  [ eq : fracrl ] .",
    "we have done a series of tests to examine the impact of flux - related selection effects , and find that the dependence of the rlf on redshift and luminosity is highly likely to be physical .",
    "the rlf is one of a few quasar properties that strongly evolve with redshift , so the evolution of the rlf places important constraints on models of quasar evolution and the radio emission mechanism . by comparing our results with the behavior of the median",

    "<S> using a sample of optically - selected quasars from the sloan digital sky survey , we have determined the radio - loud fraction ( rlf ) of quasars as a function of redshift and optical luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the sample contains more than 30,000 objects and spans a redshift range of @xmath0 and a luminosity range of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we use both the radio - to - optical flux ratio ( @xmath2 parameter ) and radio luminosity to define radio - loud quasars . after breaking the correlation between redshift and luminosity due to the flux - limited nature of the sample , we find that the rlf of quasars decreases with increasing redshift and decreasing luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the relation can be described in the form of log(rlf/(1rlf ) ) @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the absolute magnitude at rest - frame 2500  , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 . when using @xmath7 to define radio - loud quasars , we find that @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the rlf at @xmath11 declines from 24.3% to 5.6% as luminosity decreases from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , and the rlf at @xmath12 declines from 24.3% to 4.1% as redshift increases from 0.5 to 3 , suggesting that the rlf is a strong function of both redshift and luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the impact of flux - related selection effects on the rlf determination using a series of tests , and find that the dependence of the rlf on redshift and luminosity is highly likely to be physical , and the selection effects we considered are not responsible for the dependence . </S>"
