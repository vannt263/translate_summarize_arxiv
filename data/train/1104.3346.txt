    "the study of two - dimensional ( 2d ) electronic systems is of great fundamental significance in physics .",
    "atomic thin layers allow to address the role coulomb interactions in confined geometries@xcite . in this context",
    "the synthesis of graphene@xcite has triggered a huge amount of work in the understanding and controlling the properties of this system .",
    "in fact due to its unique electronic properties and the low dimensionality , graphene is considered as one of the most promising materials for future carbon - based electronics .",
    "nevertheless , the peculiar gapless ultra - relativistic energy spectrum of graphene@xcite makes the creation of carbon nanodevices based on p - n junctions highly nontrivial .",
    "therefore , transforming graphene into a semiconductor with a conventional electron spectrum keeping its two dimensionality introduced a challenge that has been a major line of research in the last years . recently",
    "an important step towards graphene electronics has been made with the synthesis of a fully hydrogenated graphene , named graphane@xcite as well as other chemically functionalized graphene - like structures@xcite .",
    "graphane is a wide band - gap dielectric@xcite and therefore it may become an important part of nanoelectronic devices as it opens a way to create 2d p - n junctions@xcite . similarly , single - atomic layers containing hybridized domains of graphene and h - bn @xcite have been synthesized and follow a completely different and novel ( electronic ) phenomenology as compared to high - purity or damaged graphene . actually , the search for low - dimensional semiconductors is not only focus on graphene and its derivative compounds but it is also moving towards other layered systems as for example mos@xmath1 , ws@xmath1 , mose@xmath1 , mote@xmath1 and bn which can be efficiently dispersed in common solvents and can be deposited as individual flakes or formed into films@xcite . in fact , mos@xmath1 monolayer has been now synthesized@xcite .",
    "contrarily to the bulk mos@xmath1 , it is a direct gap semiconductor with a band gap of 1.8 ev@xcite and could be used as single - layer transistor@xcite .",
    "thus , it is important at this point to make a deep analysis of many body effects and in particular of the nature and functional form of the screening in general low dimensional systems ( in particular two - dimensional semiconductors and insulators ) .",
    "in fact , screening effects play a fundamental role in determining the electron dynamics , the exciton binding energy and the effective electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions in the superconducting state .",
    "moreover the screening dictate the optical and transport properties of 2d devices so that knowing its behavior in low dimensional systems is fundamental also for practical applications .",
    "although in the past the problem of the screening in low dimensional systems has been extensively investigated in 2d metals@xcite and semiconducting thin films@xcite , to the best of our knowledge it has never been dealt in a strict 2d dielectric that will be the focus of this letter . in the present work we provide a strict 2d derivation of the macroscopic screening derived by keldysh as a limiting case of a thin film@xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that , contrarily to what happens in 3d systems where the macroscopic screening is mapped in a dielectric constant , in 2d systems the macroscopic screening is non local so that in the fourier space it is described by a @xmath2 dependent macroscopic dielectric function .    among the various 2d dielectrics , graphane is not only a promising material for nano devices application , but also is very interesting by itself .",
    "in fact , theoretical works based on first principles calculations predict localized spin states at hydrogen vacancies@xcite , demonstrate the existence of unusual strongly bound charge - transfer excitons@xcite and indicate that doped graphane is probably a high @xmath3 superconductor@xcite . therefore in the present work",
    "we take graphane as the test system to address in detail the influence of the 2d screening of the coulomb potential on the excitonic states and impurity levels .",
    "our findings are general in scope and can be applied to any other 2d insulator as the ones described above .",
    "the present work is organized as follows .",
    "first , we derive in a simple electrostatic model the exact two - dimensional screened potential and compare it with its three - dimensional counterpart .",
    "we also provide a very simple and pictorial understanding of that potential in terms of the potential created by a one - dimensional charge distribution which length is determined by the two - dimensional layer polarizability .",
    "the effect of the specific 2d macroscopic screening is illustrated addressing the electronic and optical properties of perfect graphane as well as the electronic levels introduced by hydrogen vacancies in the layer ( hole doping ) .",
    "we close the paper with some brief conclusions and perspectives .",
    "to determine a long wavelength static dielectric response of a general 2d insulator we consider a dielectric sheet of zero thickness at @xmath4 embedded into vacuum , and subject to an external potential @xmath5 .",
    "for definiteness we assume that @xmath5 is produced by a point charge placed at the origin @xmath6 .",
    "the total electrostatic potential @xmath7 produced by the external source is related to the total charge density @xmath8 by poisson s equation :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the sum of the external charge density and the induced charge density .",
    "the induced charge density is confined on the plane @xmath4 and , in the long wave length limit , is related to the 2d macroscopic polarization @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , which , in turn is proportional to the in - plane component of the total electric field . introducing the 2d polarizability @xmath13 of the dielectric sheet , so that @xmath14 we obtain an expression of the induced charge density in terms of the macroscopic potential evaluated at a point @xmath15 : @xmath16 with this result for the induced charge density the poisson equation for the potential of the external point charge takes the form : @xmath17 while its fourier transform can be written as : @xmath18 where @xmath2 is the in - plane component of the wave vector , and the @xmath19-integral in the right hand side defines the fourier component @xmath20 of the 2d macroscopic potential . by solving eq .",
    "( [ poiss ] ) we obtain the following result for @xmath20 @xmath21 which defines the 2d macroscopic screening of a point charge . as can be seen , for a 2d insulator the macroscopic dielectric screening is no more described by a simple dielectric constant which renormalizes the electronic charge as in 3d systems . in 2d systems",
    "a formally defined dielectric function is intrinsically @xmath2-dependent :    @xmath22    by the inverse fourier transform of @xmath23 , we can determine the effective potential @xmath24 which is felt by an electron living in the 2d dielectric in presence of a point charge :    @xmath25\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the struve function and the second kind bessel function respectively and @xmath28 . from the known asymptotic properties of the struve and bessel functions@xcite we determine the following asymptotic behavior of @xmath29 :    @xmath30\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 is the euler s constant . by the simplest possible",
    "matching of the two asymptotic behaviours we can construct an approximated expression for @xmath24 in terms of elementary functions : @xmath32\\ ] ] which gives an accurate description of the effective interaction also at intermediate values of @xmath33 as can be inferred from fig.[pot ]    the above results clearly show that , in contrast to the 3d case , the screening in 2d dielectrics introduces a new length scale @xmath34 which is determined by the the polarizability @xmath13 of the dielectric layer .",
    "when @xmath35 is larger than @xmath34 the effective potential behaves like the 3d unscreened coulomb potential while for @xmath36 it diverges logarithmically , i.  e. , it goes like the coulomb potential in two spatial dimensions ( the potential of a charged string ) .",
    "obviously the logarithmic divergence weakens when @xmath13 increases , which means that the screening is more efficient in highly polarizable systems .    to better understand the difference of the screening in 3d and 2d insulators we consider a point charge surrounded by a 3d and 2d dielectric medium , respectively ( see fig.[elfield ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) . the total electric field ( @xmath37 ) at a distance @xmath38 from the point charge will be the sum of the external field produced by the point charge ( @xmath39 ) and the induced field ( @xmath40 ) . in 3d dielectrics",
    "the latter is equivalent to the electric field produced by a uniform charge distribution on a sphere of radius @xmath38 centered on the point charge ( see fig.[elfield ] ( a ) ) .",
    "this charge distribution produces a field of the same functional form as that of the external point charge itself , @xmath41 , which means that the screening is given by a simple multiplicative renormalization . in the 2d case",
    "the situation is quite different . as can be inferred from fig.[elfield ] ( b ) , since the system is polarizable only on the plane , @xmath42 is equivalent to the electric field produced by a uniform charge distribution on a circle of radius @xmath38 . as a consequence",
    "it will be a function of @xmath38 and @xmath43 with a functional form substantially different from @xmath44 .",
    "this results in a non - local macroscopic screening .",
    "a simple and pictorial understanding of the 2d effective potential @xmath29 can be obtained by rewriting eq .",
    "( [ int2 ] ) in a different form .",
    "starting from eq.[int1 ] we replace the factor @xmath45 by its integral representation and rewrite @xmath20 as follows @xmath46 performing the fourier transform we get the following expression for the effective interaction between an electron and an external point charge @xmath47 obviously this equation is absolutely equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ int2 ] ) , but it is much more clear physically . indeed , eq .  ( [ int4 ] ) represents the potential ( in the plane @xmath4 ) produced by a one - dimensional charge distribution of the form @xmath48 noting that @xmath49 , we conclude that in the presence of the dielectric plane the point charge produces a field as it would be effectively smeared out into a 1d string with the charge distribution of eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) .",
    "this behaviour should be contrasted to the multiplicative renormalization of the charge in 3d dielectrics .",
    "thus , the effect of the 2d dielectric screening can be visualized as follows : two electrons living in a 2d dielectric plane interact as two thin charged rods of the length @xmath50 and the line charge density @xmath51 .",
    "the length of the rod sets the characteristic scale of the potential . from large distances @xmath52 the rod",
    "is seen as a point charge with the potential given by the classical 3d coulomb law eq .",
    "( [ asi1 ] ) . hence at large distance , the induced polarization is completely inefficient in screening the external field . in the opposite limit @xmath53",
    "the rod looks like an infinite wire with the line charge density @xmath54 so that the effective potential reduces to the classical 2d coulomb potential of eq .",
    "( [ asi2 ] ) .",
    "thus at small distance the effect of the induced polarization becomes dominant ",
    "the @xmath55 singularity is replaced by a weaker logarithmic dependence .",
    "it should be noted that our results for the 2d dielectric screening are very closely related to the results obtained by keldysh in ref .",
    "@xcite for the interaction potential of two point charges in a dielectric slab of the thickness @xmath56 and characterized by a static bulk dielectric constant @xmath57 ( see also ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , our eq .",
    "( [ int2 ] ) can be recovered in the limit @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the 1d distribution of the effective charge eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) can be also viewed as a limiting form of the discrete image charges used to construct the solution of the electrostatic problem for a finite dielectric slab @xcite .",
    "the important novel outcome of our derivation is that the form of the effective screened potential of eq .",
    "( [ int2 ] ) is valid even for a microscopically 2d , atomically thin dielectrics for which the notion of the bulk dielectric constant makes no sense .",
    "the only parameter entering the screened potential of eqs.([int1 ] ) and ( [ int2 ] ) is the polarizability @xmath13 of the 2d dielectric .",
    "let us show how it can be extracted from the standard ab - initio supercell calculations where 2d systems are simulated using a periodic stack of layers with sufficiently large inter - layer distance @xmath60 .",
    "for this auxiliary 3d layered system we can get the 3d macroscopic polarization @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the 3d polarizability end the total electric field respectively .",
    "the macroscopic 3d polarization can be calculated as an average over @xmath64 layers in the periodic stack of the microscopic 3d polarization @xmath65 :    @xmath66    where , in the definition of @xmath65 we have already performed the one - layer average .",
    "hence @xmath65 can be expressed in terms of the macroscopic 2d polarization @xmath67 as follows : @xmath68    with @xmath69 being the local field acting on a single layer .",
    "inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and taking @xmath60 sufficiently large so that @xmath70 we obtain an expression of @xmath13 in terms of @xmath62 ( as a generalized clausius - mossotti expression for 2d systems ) : @xmath71 where @xmath57 is the static dielectric constant of the 3d layered system .",
    "the value of @xmath57 entering eq .",
    "( [ al2d ] ) can be evaluated directly from the first principles calculation of the dielectric function @xmath72 as : @xmath73_{\\mathbf{g}=\\mathbf{g}^{\\prime}=0 } } .\\ ] ] when @xmath60 goes to infinity , @xmath57 of the layered system approaches the vacuum dielectric constant , @xmath74 .",
    "therefore the @xmath75 limit of the right hand side in eq .",
    "( [ al2d ] ) yields a finite value that is equal to the 2d polarizability . in practice one",
    "performs calculations for several sufficiently large @xmath60 to ensure the convergence of @xmath13 .",
    "we apply the results of the previous section to the description of excitonic and impurity states in graphane .",
    "the problem of excitons in graphane has been addressed recently using a fully _ ab initio _ many - body self - energy gw - bse approach @xcite . in this section",
    "we show that the effective screened potential of eq .",
    "( [ int2 ] ) combined with the @xmath0 description of the electronic and hole states leads to a very simple and accurate description of strongly bound electron - hole and hole - impurity states as obtained from the gw - bse calculations .",
    "graphane is a representative of wide band gap 2d dielectrics , which is obtained from the ideal graphene by depositing hydrogen atoms on both sides of graphene plane .",
    "the resulting electronic structure is dictated by sp@xmath76 hybridization of the carbon orbitals , which causes the opening of a wide band gap ( of 5.4 ev at the @xmath77 point ) @xcite .",
    "states at the top of the valence band belong to e@xmath78 2d irreducible representation of the graphane point group d@xmath79 , while the bottom of the conduction band belong to the a@xmath80 1d irreducible representation . as shown in ref.@xcite transitions from the top of the valence band to the bottom of the conduction band",
    "are allowed in the dipole approximation and result in strong excitonic effects in the absorption spectra .",
    "in particular , the corresponding electron - hole pairs give rise to two nearly degenerate excitons with binding energy of about 1.6 ev .",
    "this large binding energy ( one order of magnitude larger then in typical semiconductors ) seems to be surprising since both valence and conduction bands form almost perfect parabolas in a wide energy - momentum range around the @xmath77 point and therefore the excitonic states are expected to be well described in terms of the effective mass approximation , in spite of their small radius .",

    "( [ int2 ] ) and ( [ int4 ] ) .",
    "we clearly see that the unusual , large binding energy is related to a weak and nonlocal 2d dielectric screening which is completely inefficient at large distances .",
    "the small overestimation of the exciton binding energy respect to the ab - initio value may be ascribed to the lack in our approach of short range contributions to the induced polarization and exchange electron - hole interaction .",
    "all these effects can only reduce the exciton binding energy . as a matter of fact , the effects of short range corrections are small and , if necessarily , can be easily included perturbatively .    using the same formalism",

    "in this context it is worth noting that hole doped graphane has been predicted to be a high t@xmath125 superconductor @xcite .",
    "similarly to the excitonic case , the parabolicity of the valence bands in a wide energy range suggests that holes in the presence of hydrogen vacancies can be well described in terms of the effective mass approximation .",

    "therefore , for impurity levels the 2d nonlocal screening results in unusual large binding energy that exceeds by two or three orders of magnitude the corresponding values for typical semiconductors . comparing the values of the binding energy with the gap energy ( 5.4 ev ) we find that the impurity level is close to the center of the graphane gap .    finally , when the dopant is a donor , the electron in the conduction band is described by a simple 2d hydrogen like schrdinger equation with @xmath29 of eq .",
    "( [ int2 ] ) replacing the coulomb potential . in this case for the lowest bound state ( corresponding to @xmath127 and @xmath117 ) we get a binding energy of about 3.15 ev . therefore for electron doped graphane the specific 2d screening of the impurity potential also causes the formation of mid - gap impurity levels .",
    "the above results lead us to an unfortunate but important conclusion .",
    "the standard for 3d semiconductors impurity doping , both donor and acceptor , will probably not work for graphane and most likely for other atomically thin dielectric .",
    "in particular a slightly dehydrogenated graphane can not be considered as a semiconductor with extra highly mobile holes in the valence band .",
    "all holes will be strongly localized on the hydrogen vacancies with the radius of the bound state of the order of the interatomic distance .",
    "the reason for this behavior is a very weak and inefficient screening in 2d dielectric materials .",
    "in conclusion , we derived an expression of the macroscopic screening in 2d dielectrics showing that , contrarily to what happens in 3d systems where the macroscopic screening is mapped in a dielectric constant , in 2d systems the macroscopic screening is non local . as a result",
    "the effective potential produced by an external point charge surrounded by a 2d dielectric has a functional form which is substantially different from the bare coulomb potential .",
    "it presents a logarithmic divergence for @xmath36 and reduces to the unscreened coulomb potential at large distances .",
    "the 2d polarizability @xmath13 determines the characteristic length scale @xmath34 at which the two asymptotic forms are matched .",

    "<S> for atomic thin layer insulating materials we provide an exact analytic form of the two - dimensional screened potential . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to three - dimensional systems where the macroscopic screening can be described by a static dielectric constant in 2d systems the macroscopic screening is non local ( q - dependent ) showing a logarithmic divergence for small distances and reaching the unscreened coulomb potential for large distances . the cross - over of these two regimes </S>",
    "<S> is dictated by 2d layer polarizability that can be easily computed by standard first - principles techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the present results have strong implications for describing gap - impurity levels and also exciton binding energies . </S>",
    "<S> the simple model derived here captures the main physical effects and reproduces well , for the case of graphane , the full many - body gw plus bethe - salpeter calculations . as an additional outcome </S>",
    "<S> we show that the impurity hole - doping in graphane leads to strongly localized states , what hampers applications in electronic devices . in spite of the inefficient and nonlocal two - dimensional macroscopic screening </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a simple @xmath0 approach is capable to describe the electronic and transport properties of confined 2d systems . </S>"
