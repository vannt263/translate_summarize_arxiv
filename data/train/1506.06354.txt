    "the models chosen for atmospheric calculations are the last computed models of the sequences 5 , 22 and 27 , which have the final masses of 3.0 , 4.4 , and 5.1  @xmath6 , respectively .",

    "the optical luminosity of a helium star at the pre - sn stage is a sensitive function of its mass and radius  @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that there exists a fairly good mass - radius relation for binary sn ib / c progenitors at the pre - sn stage , and therefore these selected models can roughly represent the surface properties of sn ib / c progenitors for the given final masses .",
    "given the neutron star remnant mass of about 1.3  @xmath6 , this range of helium star masses is consistent with the peak values of the sn ib / c ejecta mass distribution ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) inferred from sn light curves  @xcite .",
    "it also fits well with the inferred ejecta mass of iptf13bvn ( @xmath13 ; @xcite ) , and thus we can directly compare our result to the observed properties of the tentative iptf13bvn progenitor .",
    "@xcite adopted the wr mass - loss rate given by @xcite using a reduction factor of 5 - 10 to consider the effect of wr wind clumping .",
    "however , the resulting wind mass - loss rates of these models are not high enough to have an optically thick wr type wind , in particular for 3.0 and 4.4  @xmath0 helium stars , given that their masses are relatively low and that their envelopes have relatively large radii .",
    "but the mass - loss rates from helium stars of the considered mass range are not well constrained by observations .",
    "these helium stars undergo very rapid increase in the surface luminosity as they approach to the pre - sn stage @xcite , and we can not exclude the possibility that mass loss becomes dramatically strong during this final stage ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) , which is in fact implied by many sn ib / c observations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "cmfgen requires a complete ( previously converged ) model including atmospheric structure , atomic models and their departure coefficients as the initial trial solution . for our calculations , we first adopted one of the pre - calculated o star models provided by hillier with the effective temperature of 27,500  k and @xmath15 of 3.25 , which are similar to those of our 4.4  @xmath0 helium star ( table  [ tbl1 ] ) .",

    "note that these are not unique solutions .",
    "@xcite followed the spin - up of mass accreting star as a result of mass and angular momentum accretion and the resulting enhancement of mass loss , and thus the mass transfer process is highly non - conservative in their calculations .",
    "however , the companion star masses can significantly vary according to the adopted mass accretion efficiency ( i.e. , the ratio of the transferred mass to the accreted mass ) .",
    "for example , if the mass transfer were conservative , a binary system where both stars have an initial mass of about 20  @xmath0 could produce a 3 @xmath0 helium star that has a structure similar to that of the 3.0  @xmath0 models of the present study , via case a and ab mass transfers .",

    "we have presented atmospheric models of relatively low - mass helium stars ( 3.0 , 4.4 , and 5.1  @xmath0 ) at the final evolutionary stage , which may represent typical sn ib / c progenitors in binary systems .",
    "we confirm the prediction by @xcite that these binary progenitors can be significantly brighter than more massive wr progenitors in the optical , and the visual brightness becomes higher for a less massive helium star progenitor because of the more extended envelope .",
    "their absolute magnitudes in the optical bands are comparable to those of 20 - 30  @xmath6 o - type stars ( @xmath79 mag ) .",
    "but unlike o - type stars , their spectra could be marked by strong emission lines if the mass - loss rate is sufficiently high .",
    "the envelopes of helium stars of 3 - 4  @xmath0 undergo rapid expansion during the late evolutionary stages to become a helium giant ( @xmath80 ; @xcite ) , and the resulting emission lines would be fairly narrow , compared to those of typical wr stars ( figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "we compared our results with the observational properties of the progenitor candidate of the sn ib iptf13bvn .",
    "we find that models with 3.0/4.4  @xmath0 helium star plus a 20/30  @xmath0 o - type star companion give the best fit with the observation in terms of magnitudes and colors , in good agreement with @xcite , but a 3.0  @xmath0 helium star progenitor can also have optical magnitudes comparable to those of the iptf13bvn progenitor even without an o - type star companion  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for a similar conclusion ) , depending on the degree of extinction to the source .",
    "future observations might find the surviving o - type star companion of the iptf13bvn progenitor . according to our prediction",
    ", its optical brightness should be lower by about @xmath81 mag than that of the observed brightness of the iptf13bvn progenitor , depending on the combination of the helium star and o - type star masses .",
    "this is because the contribution from the helium star progenitor must have disappeared .",
    "if no meaningful change in the optical magnitudes of the source is found in the future , it may indicate either that the iptf13bvn progenitor was more massive than about @xmath82 while the source was the o - type companion star of @xmath83 , or that the source was not associated with iptf13bvn at all .",
    "a caveat in this argument is that the luminosity of the companion star might have been significantly influenced by the interaction with the sn ejecta , and that there even exists the possibility that the source appears somewhat more luminous than in the pre - sn image , because of the shock heating in the companion star  @xcite .",
    "however , as discussed above , a @xmath84 helium star alone without a luminous companion can also explain the optical brightness of the iptf13bvn progenitor in principle and non - detection of the surviving companion star would not necessarily imply a single star progenitor because the companion could be a faint dwarf star or a compact object  @xcite .",
    "with reversal of the sn order in a case a binary system , such a relatively low - mass helium star progenitor produced in a binary system might not even have any companion at the pre - sn stage  @xcite .",
    "one important question still remains to be answered : if binary progenitors can be so bright in the optical as predicted by our models and if they represent typical sn ib / c progenitors , why have they been so elusive in the previous searches ?",
    "the detection limits were @xmath85 mag and @xmath86 mag in the searches of the progenitors of sn 2002ap and sn 2010br , respectively @xcite .",
    "they would have been detected , if their masses were about @xmath87  ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) , even without a luminous companion . however , all of the other searches had more severe detection limits ( @xmath88 mag ) , and the progenitors would have been detected only with an o - type star companion of @xmath89 .",
    "the previous difficulty in detecting a sn ib / c progenitor might have resulted from the fact that most sn ib / c progenitors in binary systems do not have a luminous o - type star companion .",
    "it should also be noted that sn ic progenitors would be generally more difficult to detect than sn ib progenitors .",
    "this is because sn ib progenitors would have a fairly massive helium envelope that results in large radii at the pre - sn stage ( hence high optical luminosities ) , while sn ic progenitors that are helium - deficient would remain very hot and faint in the optical  @xcite .",
    "sn 2002ap was a sn ic , and therefore it is not surprising that its progenitor could not be detected even with such a deep search .",
    "this issue should be addressed more carefully with a binary population synthesis model that fully takes into account the evolutionary effects on the helium star structure at the final evolutionary stage and the recent observational constraints on the sn ib / c ejecta masses  ( cf .",
