    "the mott transition is one of the central problems in the field of strongly correlated electronic systems .",
    "it is directly relevant to many compounds , such as @xmath6 , @xmath7 @xcite , fullerenes @xcite , and two - dimensional organics of the @xmath8-bedt family @xcite .",
    "viewed from a more general perspective , the mott transition confronts us with the need to describe electrons in a solid in an intermediate coupling regime , where perturbative methods around either the localised or the itinerant limit are of very limited use .",
    "the mott phenomenon is also a key issue for the development of electronic structure calculations of strongly correlated materials , a subject of current intense investigation @xcite .",
    "a breakthrough in the understanding of this problem resulted from the development of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite . following the observation that a mott transition as a function of the interaction strength @xmath9 takes place in a ( fully frustrated ) one - band hubbard model at half - filling @xcite within dmft , a rather surprising scenario was unravelled @xcite . in the parameter space defined by temperature and interaction strength ,",
    "two kinds of solutions of the dmft equations were found , corresponding to an insulator and a metal , with a region @xmath10 in which both types of solution coexist .",
    "the spectral function of the insulating solution has only high - energy features corresponding to hubbard bands , while the metallic solution also has a low - energy quasiparticle resonance .",
    "coexistence results in a _ first - order _ phase transition at finite temperature .",
    "the first order line ends into a second - order critical endpoint at @xmath11 , @xmath12 at which the coexistence domain closes ( @xmath13 ) . at @xmath14 ,",
    "the transition is also second - order , because the metallic solution always has lower energy than the insulating one .",
    "a qualitative picture of the evolution of the spectral function as a function of control parameters was obtained , and this resulted in successful experimental predictions @xcite .    early work on these issues relied heavily on an accurate but approximate technique , the iterative perturbation theory @xcite . later on , exact results near @xmath15 were obtained @xcite , thanks to the development of a renormalization method exploiting the separation of energy scales that holds true close to this critical coupling .",
    "this method performs a projection onto a low - energy effective theory after elimination of the degrees of freedom corresponding to hubbard bands .",
    "a clear picture of the structure of the dmft equations near the mott transition and of the different critical points was finally obtained through the introduction of a landau functional approach @xcite .",
    "these established results for the one - band hubbard model together with numerical methods for solving dmft equations , such as quantum monte carlo @xcite and numerical renormalization group @xcite , provide now a consistent picture of the mott transition within dmft .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the mott transition in the limit of large orbital degeneracy , within dmft .",
    "we establish analytically that the critical couplings @xmath16 and @xmath15 are not only different , but that they have very different scalings as a function of the number @xmath0 of orbitals .",
    "indeed , @xmath1 increases as @xmath17 , while @xmath2 increases as @xmath0 , so that the coexistence region widens .",
    "close to @xmath2 , the separation of scales which is at the heart of the projective method becomes asymptotically exact for large @xmath0 .",
    "this allows us to determine exactly the value of the critical coupling @xmath5 at large @xmath0 , and also to demonstrate that slave - boson like approximations become asymptotically valid at low energy in this limit .",
    "finally , we discuss how the finite temperature metal - insulator transition depends on the number of orbitals .",
    "our findings on the critical couplings are in agreement with early qmc results for the two - orbital model ( @xmath18 ) @xcite , and with recent results for higher values of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a widening of the coexistence window @xmath19 $ ] as @xmath0 increases is clearly seen in these simulations .",
    "also , for fixed @xmath0 , the critical coupling required to enter the mott state is largest @xcite at the particle - hole symmetric filling @xmath20 .",
    "the present work also puts the results of refs.@xcite in a new perspective : there , a @xmath17 scaling of the critical coupling was proposed .",
    "we find that this indeed applies to the coupling where the insulator becomes unstable ( @xmath1 ) , while the true @xmath14 mott transition ( at which the quasiparticle residue vanishes ) takes place at @xmath21 . indeed , in ref.@xcite , the @xmath17 scaling was rationalized on the basis of a stability argument for the insulator .",
    "finally , the rather high temperatures considered in @xcite explain why only the @xmath17 dependence was reported there : distinguishing @xmath2 from @xmath1 requires significantly lower temperatures @xcite .",
    "the limit of large orbital degeneracy is relevant to the physics of systems with partially filled d- or f- shells , as well as to fullerenes .",
    "direct numerical approaches become prohibitively difficult as the number of orbital increases ( qmc methods scale as a power law of @xmath0 , while exact diagonalizations @xcite scale exponentially ) .",
    "it is therefore important for future research to develop approximate but accurate impurity solvers which can handle many orbitals .",
    "the controlled results that we establish in this paper can be used as tests of these approximation methods .",
    "we consider a generalized hubbard model involving @xmath0 species of electrons , with hamiltonian : @xmath22 ^2 \\\\ & - & { { \\widetilde{\\mu } } } \\sum_i   \\sum_{\\sigma=1}^{n}\\ , d_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger}d_{i\\sigma } \\label{hubbard}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 are sites indices , @xmath24 the orbital index , @xmath25 is the chemical potential and @xmath26 the average density of particles per species : @xmath27 introducing @xmath26 in the hamiltonian is just a convention for the chemical potential @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , it is convenient at half - filling where the particle - hole symmetry implies @xmath28 and @xmath29 . for a single site ( atom ) , the spectrum consists of @xmath30 levels , with energies @xmath31 depending only on the total charge on the orbital : @xmath32 and with degeneracies @xmath33 .",
    "the usual single - orbital hubbard model corresponds to @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian considered here has a full su(@xmath0 ) symmetry which includes both spin and orbital degrees of freedom . starting from a more realistic model which assumes an interaction matrix @xmath36 between opposite spins and @xmath37 between parallel spins",
    ", it corresponds to the limit of isotropic @xmath38 and vanishing hund s coupling @xmath39 .",
    "when @xmath9 is large enough , we expect a mott insulating state to exist at fillings @xmath40 , corresponding to an integer occupancy of each site on average @xmath41 . in this paper",
    ", we investigate analytically the nature of these mott transitions within dmft .",
    "we consider only phases with no magnetic ordering and study the transition between a paramagnetic metal and a paramagnetic mott insulator . in section [ sec.ngrand ] ,",
    "we extract the large-@xmath0 behaviour of @xmath1 and @xmath2 using the low - energy projective technique analysis of the dmft equations introduced in @xcite for @xmath34 and extended in @xcite : we show that the equations for the @xmath42 s derived by this method are greatly simplified for @xmath43 in the sense that an atomic limit becomes exact . in section [ sec : slave ] , we find quantitative agreement between these results and a multiorbital slave boson method .",
    "finally , in sec.[sec : finitet ] , we consider the mott transition at finite temperature .",
    "let us recall briefly the dmft equations and their low - energy projective analysis @xcite .",
    "dmft maps the lattice hamiltonian above onto a multi - orbital anderson impurity model with the same local interaction term than in ( [ hubbard ] ) and a hybridization function @xmath44 .",
    "the local green s function reads : @xmath45 . in this expression",
    ", @xmath25 is the chemical potential ( shifted by the hartree contribution ) and @xmath46 is a local self - energy .",
    "a self - consistency requirement is imposed , which identifies @xmath47 with the on - site green s function of the lattice model with the same self - energy @xmath46 .",
    "this reads : @xmath48 in this expression , @xmath49 is the free electron density of state ( d.o.s . )",
    "corresponding to the fourier transform of the hopping matrix elements @xmath50 . in the particular case of a semi - circular d.o.s . with half - width @xmath51 , equation  ( [ eq : self - consistency ] )",
    "simplifies to : @xmath52 solving the impurity model subject to ( [ eq : self - consistency ] ) determines both the hybridization function and the local green s function in a self - consistent manner . in order to give an explicit hamiltonian form to the anderson impurity model",
    ", the function @xmath53 can be represented with an auxiliary bath of conduction electrons @xmath54 , with effective single - particle energies @xmath55 and effective hybridizations @xmath56 to the local orbital such that : @xmath57 ^2\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    within dmft , the mott transition at @xmath2 and @xmath14 is associated with a separation of energy scales . for @xmath9",
    "slightly smaller than @xmath2 , the d - electron spectral function has a sharp quasiparticle peak , well separated from the high - energy hubbard bands .",
    "naturally , a small amount of spectral weight does connect these two features in the metal . slightly above @xmath2 ,",
    "the mott gap @xmath58 separating the hubbard bands of the insulating solution is finite .",
    "while the weight @xmath59 of the quasiparticle peak vanishes at @xmath2 , the mott gap @xmath58 disappears only at the smaller critical coupling @xmath1 .",
    "because of the self - consistency condition ( [ eq : self - consistency ] ) , the hybridization function of the effective conduction bath ( and hence the @xmath55 s ) also displays this separation of scales .",
    "this remark led the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite to use a _ projective method _ in order to study the critical behaviour at @xmath2 . within this approach",
    ", the effective conduction electron bath is separated into a high energy sector ( @xmath60 ) associated with the upper ( @xmath61 ) and lower ( @xmath62 ) hubbard bands , and a low - energy sector ( @xmath63 ) associated with the quasiparticle resonance .",
    "the impurity model hamiltonian is thus written as ( for simplicity we take @xmath64 and @xmath65 independent of @xmath66 ) : we note that the self - consistency condition ( [ eq : self - consistency ] ) implies that @xmath67 is proportional to the quasi - particle residue @xmath59 , so that it is clear that the low - energy hybridization vanishes at @xmath2 .    in order to obtain an effective theory close to @xmath2 ,",
    "one first diagonalizes the high - energy part @xmath68 of the hamiltonian , and obtains an effective low - energy hamiltonian by expanding in @xmath64 . from the presence of a finite gap in the high - energy bath @xmath69",
    ", @xmath70 describes an impurity in a semiconducting bath .",
    "the position of the d - level ( _ i.e. _ the chemical potential ) fixes the number of electrons in the ground - state . for a charge @xmath71 , this high - energy problem has a @xmath33 degenerate ground - state , spanned by eigenvectors @xmath72 ( with eigen - energy @xmath73 ) .",
    "the detailed form of these states is complicated ( they mix with higher impurity charge states through @xmath65 ) , but _ they form a representation of the su(@xmath0 ) `` spin '' group , of dimension @xmath33_.    using a generalized schrieffer - wolff ( sw ) transformation to order @xmath74 in order to project onto the low - energy hilbert space ( defined by the selected charge sector of the impurity @xmath75 , and the low - energy sector for the conduction bath @xmath76 ) , one obtains an effective kondo hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a hubbard operator connecting two states in the ground state manifold .",
    "the hamiltonian contains potential scattering terms for @xmath79 and spin - flip ( kondo ) terms for @xmath80 , with the spin operator @xmath81 .",
    "the matrix of ( dimensionless ) coupling constants reads @xcite : @xmath82 we emphasize that the low - energy hamiltonian has been derived to first order in @xmath74 : this is asymptotically justified exactly at the critical point ( and hence sufficient to determine the critical coupling ) , but deviations away from the critical point require to consider higher order terms in @xmath64 .",
    "finally , we note that the bandwidth of this kondo problem is of order @xmath83 , while the coupling is of order @xmath84 .",
    "hence , the dimensionless coupling constant of the effective low - energy kondo problem is of order one : we have an _ intermediate coupling _",
    "kondo problem @xcite .",
    "the conditions that determine @xmath1 and @xmath2 have been derived within the projective method @xcite and within the more general landau functional approach @xcite ( in which the stability of the insulating solution to different kinds of low - energy perturbations is studied using a landau functional of the hybridization function @xmath44 ) .",
    "the condition for @xmath2 reads : @xmath85 as explained in @xcite , an analogous equation is found for @xmath1 , where off - diagonal terms in the average are taken to zero . for finite @xmath0 ,",
    "this equation is complicated to solve , since the average on the right - hand side is a function of @xmath86 which we can only obtain by solving the low energy kondo problem explicitly .",
    "however , we will show in the following that :    1 .   using the @xmath87 symmetry , the tensor structure of @xmath86 can be parametrized with only two numbers @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which are dimensionless functions of @xmath0 , @xmath26 , and @xmath90 .",
    "this greatly simplifies ( [ ucondition ] ) ( section [ sub.simpliftensor ] ) .",
    "an explicit calculation of @xmath88 and @xmath89 can be performed in the atomic limit @xmath91 .",
    "this allows us to show that the two critical couplings have the following @xmath0-dependence at large @xmath0 : in fact , the atomic limit evaluation of @xmath88 and @xmath89 becomes asymptotically exact when @xmath9 is taken to be proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "this is not the case when @xmath92 , but we show that corrections to the atomic limit do not modify the scaling ( [ scalingu ] ) .",
    "3 .   for @xmath93 , the effective kondo problem can actually be solved explicitly at large @xmath0 , using standard techniques .",
    "this allows for an explicit computation of the matrix element @xmath94 involved in ( [ ucondition ] ) . since",
    ", from the above remark , the effective couplings entering the kondo problem can be evaluated in the atomic limit in that case , this allows us to determine the prefactor @xmath95 exactly ( sec .",
    "[ sub : largenkondoeff ] ) . because the atomic limit is not asymptotically exact for @xmath92 , we are not able to obtain an exact determination of @xmath96 .",
    "computing the couplings ( [ defj ] ) is a complicated task in general , since it requires a knowledge of the states @xmath97 , and thus a diagonalization of @xmath68 .",
    "however , general considerations based on the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry of the model allow one to reduce the unknown kondo couplings @xmath98 to two dimensionless numbers only .",
    "let us consider the operator : @xmath99 since the hamiltonian is su(@xmath0 ) symmetric , this operator transforms under su(@xmath0 ) with the representation @xmath100 : the tensor product of the fundamental @xmath101 ( one box in the young tableau language ) and its complex conjugate @xmath102 ( @xmath103 boxes ) , which reduces to the sum of the identity @xmath104 and the adjoint @xmath105 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath106 the ground state representation ( a column with @xmath71 boxes ) , the tensor structure of @xmath86 is then given by the wigner - eckart theorem : we have to find the occurence of @xmath106 in @xmath107 .",
    "we have a trivial term @xmath108 and _ a single _ non trivial one since @xmath109 , where @xmath110 denotes other irreducible representations .",

    "let us consider the operator @xmath114 , which has the same symmetry as @xmath115 , so the previous symmetry argument gives @xmath116 with the _ same _ @xmath112 , but _ different coefficients _ @xmath117 .",
    "since @xmath118 , we can eliminate @xmath112 between the two equations .",
    "we finally obtain the general form , valid to first order in @xmath74 for a @xmath119 symmetric model : @xmath120 in this expression , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are dimensionless coefficients which depend only on the dimensionless ratio @xmath90 associated with the high - energy problem ( and of course a priori also on orbital number @xmath0 and density @xmath26 ) . inserting ( [ jreduced ] ) into equation ( [ ucondition ] )",
    ", we obtain the simplified form of the conditions which determine the critical couplings :      the atomic limit approximation is defined by @xmath91 . in this limit , the states @xmath123 are just the impurity states @xmath124 ( @xmath32 ) , without mixing with the high - energy electron sector . in that case ,",
    "@xmath88 and @xmath89 ( from ( [ jreduced ] ) ) can be computed explicitly (  we choose here @xmath29 , _ i.e. _ the chemical potential is bound to be at the center of a step in the coulomb staircase ) .",
    "we find : @xmath125 we note that these coefficients do not depend on @xmath0 in the atomic limit .",
    "moreover , it is clear that , in general ( for an explicit proof , see sec.[sub : largenkondoeff ] ) : @xmath126 when using these results into ( [ reduceducondition]-[reduceducondition - b ] ) , we obtain the @xmath0-dependence of the critical couplings quoted in ( [ scalingu]-[scalingu - b ] ) .",
    "this derivation relies on the use of the atomic limit @xmath91 .",
    "an important question is therefore to check that the @xmath0-dependence of the critical couplings is not modified by the interaction @xmath65 that dresses the atomic states @xmath72 .",
    "we examine carefully this question in appendix  [ appendix ] , where we give an explicit proof that this is indeed the case .",

    "@xmath9 must be scaled as @xmath127 . in that case , we show in the appendix that the atomic limit calculation of @xmath88 and @xmath89 is in fact _ exact _ at large @xmath0 .",
    "this can be expected since the band gap diverges with @xmath0 , so that the hubbard bands are well separated from the low energy degrees of freedom .",
    "however , one might worry that the growing number of orbitals ( @xmath0 ) could counterbalance this effect .",
    "this is actually not the case , and we show that the corrections to @xmath86 ( or @xmath88,@xmath89 ) coming from @xmath65 are subdominant in large-@xmath0 , order by order in perturbation theory . moreover , the low - energy effective kondo problem becomes exactly solvable when @xmath93 ( i.e close to @xmath2 ) : this is the subject of the next section ( sec .",

    "however , we are able to show ( sec .  [",
    "sub : uc1 ] of the appendix ) that these corrections are of order one , so that the scaling @xmath128 does hold .      in this section",
    ", we explicitly solve the low energy effective kondo problem in the large-@xmath0 limit using standard methods @xcite , in order to obtain the prefactor @xmath95 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : kondo - general ] ) reduces at order ( @xmath129 ) to : @xmath130 this model becomes exactly solvable at large @xmath0 because the kondo coupling scales as @xmath131 ( which is a result of @xmath93 ) .",
    "introducing an auxiliary boson field @xmath132 conjugate to @xmath133 , and a lagrange multiplier field @xmath134 to enforce the constraint @xmath135 , we see that , as @xmath136 , the field @xmath132 undergoes a bose condensation , and the saddle - point values of the @xmath137 fields are determined by the equations ( at @xmath14 ) : in this expression , @xmath138 denotes the green s function of the low - energy part of the effective bath of conduction electrons , in the absence of kondo coupling , namely : @xmath139    first we express the self - consistency condition ( [ eq : self - consistency ] ) or more precisely its low - energy counterpart .",
    "we relate the low - energy part of the on - site green s function , @xmath140 , to the auxiliary - fermion one , @xmath141 , by imposing that the low - energy part of the interacting green s function of the effective bath of conduction electrons , @xmath142 , can be calculated either from the original anderson model or from the low - energy projected kondo model , with identical results .",

    "a determination of the critical behaviour of @xmath59 slightly away from the critical point would require considering higher - order terms in the effective low - energy hamiltonian .",

    "minimum_. indeed , a minimum with a lower energy exists for @xmath206 . to find this critical coupling ,",
    "we perturb around the trivial solution . close to @xmath2 , only the occupancies of the states with charge @xmath207 matter , and we set : @xmath208 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 otherwise ( where @xmath211 denote terms that can be neglected ) .",
    "the energy difference with the trivial insulating solution reads : @xmath212 hence , the critical coupling at which the metallic solution disappears reads : @xmath213 this value coincides with that obtained by lu @xcite using the gutzwiller approximation .",
    "remarkably , it agrees with our exact result in the @xmath43 limit .",
    "together with the considerations above , this suggests that such a slave boson approach becomes asymptotically exact , at low - energy and close to the critical coupling @xmath2 , in this limit .",
    "this estimate of the critical coupling is already quite accurate for the smallest value of @xmath34 ( we take for reference a semi - circular band with half - width @xmath214 ) : @xmath215 ( the nrg and the projective analysis of the one - orbital model indicate that @xmath216 is very close to 3 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the large-@xmath0 solution given by equation ( [ uc2-critical ] ) misses obviously the sub - leading term of order @xmath217 , and is therefore inaccurate at small @xmath0 .",
    "the behaviour of the quasi - particle weight close to the transition can be obtained by expanding the energy to next order in @xmath218 , taking into account that @xmath219 ( so that only the terms with @xmath220 matter ) .",

    "it is not entirely obvious to decide what the critical coupling @xmath1 is within this approach .",
    "since the insulating solution exists for arbitrary @xmath9 , one might be tempted to conclude that @xmath222 .",
    "another criterion would be to find at which coupling the optical gap of the insulator vanishes .",
    "unfortunately , the above approximation ( condensed bosons ) is insufficient to discuss high - energy features ( hubbard bands ) .",
    "studies that go beyond this approximation @xcite and incorporate fluctuations of the slave bosons suggest that the optical gap closes at @xmath2 : in that sense the slave boson approximation does not yield a coexistence regime , in contrast to the exact results established above ( which are the generic situation within dmft ) .",
    "we conclude this paper by addressing the finite - temperature aspects of the transitions discussed above . as in the one - band case",
    ", we expect a coexistence region @xmath223 at finite temperature , which closes at a second - order ( liquid - gas ) critical point @xmath224 , with @xmath13 .",
    "comparison of free - energies then yield a first - order transition line @xmath225 for @xmath226 .",
    "this has been the subject of many studies in the single orbital case , and is now established on firm grounds .",
    "however , no analytical estimate of the critical temperature @xmath227 is available .",
    "this is highly desirable , since this scale appears to be strongly reduced in comparison to the electronic bandwidth .",
    "it would also be interesting to know how this scale depends on the orbital degeneracy .",
    "let us start with a qualitative argument , which has two merits in our view : ( i ) it allows to understand why @xmath228 is such a small energy scale for a small number of orbitals and ( ii ) it provides a _ lower _ bound on @xmath227 .",
    "this argument is based on a comparison of the energy difference between the metallic and insulating solutions at @xmath14 , to the corresponding entropy difference . for @xmath127 close to @xmath2 ,",
    "the energy difference @xmath229 is expected to behave as : @xmath230 this is indeed supported by the slave - boson calculation of sec.[sec : slave ] .",
    "the entropy difference @xmath231 is dominated by the entropy of the insulating solution ( which has a degenerate ground - state ) since the entropy of the metal vanishes linearly with @xmath232 at low temperature @xmath232 . therefore : @xmath233 this allows to estimate the behaviour of the first - order critical line @xmath234 ( or @xmath235 ) at low - temperature ( i.e for @xmath9 close to @xmath2 ) .",
    "indeed , the transition into the insulating state upon raising temperature occurs when the entropic gain overcomes the energy cost , leading to : @xmath236 this estimate is valid only at very low temperature , close to the @xmath14 critical point @xmath237 .",
    "it indicates a quadratic dependence of the critical line , with a prefactor which is independent of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath1 is close to @xmath2 , which is the case for a small number of orbitals ( in particular in the one - band case ) , one can roughly estimate the critical endpoint @xmath227 by using ( [ tc_closetouc2 ] ) in the regime of couplings where the insulating solution disappears , leading to :  @xmath238 .",
    "it is clear from this formula that the ratio @xmath228 is small because of the small energy difference between the metallic and insulating solutions . for a larger number of orbitals",
    "however , this can only produce a _ lower bound _ on the critical endpoint @xmath227 .",
    "indeed , the energy difference close to @xmath227 is certainly underestimated by ( [ estimenerg ] ) , while the entropy difference is reduced as compared to @xmath239 since the entropy of the metal can not be neglected at @xmath227 ( we note that it behaves as @xmath240 with @xmath241 ) .",
    "this argument shows that @xmath228 must either saturate to a constant , or increase with @xmath0 , as @xmath0 increases .",
    "we now turn to a more quantitative study of these finite - temperature issues , using the landau functional formalism introduced in @xcite .",
    "a functional of the effective hybridisation is introduced , which reads , for the @xmath0-orbital model on the bethe lattice ( semi - circular d.o.s ) : @xmath242\\,=\\,\\frac{n}{2t^2}\\,\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\sum_n",

    "hence , the couplings @xmath250 ( resp .",
    "@xmath251 ) correspond to the instability line of the @xmath252 plane along which a negative eigenvalue appears when @xmath249 is evaluated for the insulating ( resp .",
    "metallic ) solution . for @xmath14",
    ", these instability criteria should coincide with those derived from the projective method described above ( as verified below for @xmath16 ) .",
    "the critical endpoint @xmath11 is such that , for @xmath253 , no negative eigenvalue is found , at any coupling @xmath9 , when the stability matrix is evaluated on the ( unique ) dmft solution .",
    "it should thus be noted that , in order to determine @xmath224 , it is not necessary to know _ both _ @xmath250 and",
    "@xmath251 : either one of them is in principle sufficient .",
    "the practical difficulty in performing this stability analysis at finite temperature is that : ( i ) it requires a knowledge of the finite - t solution of the dmft equations -or at least a reasonable approximation to it- and ( ii ) the two - particle correlator ( [ eq : knm ] ) must be evaluated for this solution .",
    "completing this program , for arbitrary orbital degeneracy , using numerical methods , is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , we would like to present here a simpler calculation which gives some insight in the dependence of @xmath250 ( and of @xmath227 ) on the orbital degeneracy @xmath0 .",
    "what we have done is to use the atomic limit as a very rough first approximation to the insulating solution .",
    "we have evaluated the 2-particle correlator @xmath254 and the stability matrix @xmath249 in this limit , for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "this can be directly implemented on the computer , using the spectral decomposition of @xmath254 onto atomic eigenstates ( some details are provided in appendix [ atomic_code ] ) .",
    "the stability matrix is then diagonalised numerically ( a truncation to a -large- number of matsubara frequencies is made ) , and we search for the line in the @xmath252 plane where a negative eigenvalue is first found .",
    "the result of this calculation ( for the half - filled case @xmath20 ) is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tc_atomic ] .",
    "there , the temperature below which a negative eigenvalue is found is plotted as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "we first observe that no instability is found above a critical value of @xmath9 , which does coincide with the value ( [ reduceducondition ] ) : @xmath255 estimated above from the projective method ( in the atomic approximation ) .",
    "this is a non - trivial consistency check on our calculations .",
    "secondly , we find that the instability lines for different values of the orbital degeneracy @xmath0 can all be collapsed on a single curve when both @xmath232 and @xmath9 are rescaled by @xmath256 .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that , in the atomic limit , only the two scales @xmath9 and @xmath232 enter the two - particle correlator @xmath254 ( _ not _",
    "@xmath257 ) , and that @xmath258 is of order @xmath259 , so that the instability criterion can be written ( from dimensionality considerations ) : @xmath260 .",
    "naturally , we do not expect the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : tc_atomic ] to be a quantitatively reliable determination of @xmath250 , because of the atomic approximation involved .",
    "in particular , we see that , instead of terminating at a critical endpoint @xmath224 , the instability line in fig .",
    "[ fig : tc_atomic ] bends back , yielding a stability window at small @xmath9 which is certainly a spurious aspect of the approximation .",
    "hence only the branch of the curve corresponding to larger values of @xmath9 has physical significance .",
    "it is tempting to conclude , from the the observed scaling with @xmath256 , that @xmath227 itself will grow in that manner as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "indeed , we note that recent qmc calculations by amadon and biermann  @xcite do show a marked increase of @xmath227 with @xmath0 , not inconsistent with a @xmath17 scaling",
    ". however , we do not consider this issue to be entirely settled : rather , this atomic estimate provides an _ upper bound _ on the growth of @xmath227 with @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , it neglects the presence of the quasiparticle resonance ( which is reduced but still present as temperature is raised close to @xmath227 ) .",
    "the resonance makes the solution less stable , so that the atomic calculation is likely to overestimate @xmath227 .",
    "combined with the above entropy argument ( which provides a lower bound ) , we conclude that @xmath228 is an increasing function of @xmath0 at moderate values of @xmath0 , which either saturates at large-@xmath0 or increases at most as @xmath17 .",
    "clearly , a more refined analysis of the above stability condition is required to settle this issue .     of eq .",
    "( [ eq : stabmatrix ] ) is evaluated in the atomic approximation .",
    "the various curves are for increasing number of orbitals ( @xmath261 ) , and an almost perfect scaling with @xmath262 and @xmath263 is found.,width=340 ]",
    "in this paper , we have studied the mott transition of the @xmath0-orbital hubbard model in the fully symmetric case .",
    "the physical picture is qualitatively the same as for @xmath34 , _",
    "i.e. _ a coexistence region exists between an insulating and a metallic solution within two distincts critical couplings @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we have shown that these critical couplings _ do not have the same dependence on the number of orbitals _ , as the latter becomes large : @xmath264 while @xmath21 .",
    "we have obtained an exact analytical determination of the critical value @xmath265 in this limit .",
    "these results explain the widening of the coexistence window @xmath19 $ ] observed in the numerical simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite , and more recently in @xcite .",
    "our findings also put the results of refs .",
    "@xcite in a new perspective , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "we have shown that , at large @xmath0 and close to the critical coupling @xmath2 , the scaling @xmath127 is appropriate , so that the separation of scale which is at the heart of the projective method becomes asymptotically exact .",
    "the low - energy physics close to @xmath2 is then well described by slave - boson like approximations .",
    "this is the case in particular for the quasi - particle peak in the spectral function , which is separated from hubbard bands by a large energy ( of order @xmath266 ) and is accurately described by the simple form ( [ eq : ldosfinal ] ) . in view of practical applications to electronic structure calculations with large orbital degeneracy ( e.g f - electron systems ) , it would be highly desirable to have also an analytical determination of the high - energy part of the spectral function in the large-@xmath0 limit ( or at least reasonable approximations to it ) .",
    "this is left for future investigations .",
    "another issue that we have only partly addressed is the finite - temperature aspects of these transitions .",
    "the whole finite - temperature coexistence region widens as @xmath0 is increased , and the critical temperature associated with the mott critical endpoint does increase with the number of orbitals at intermediate values of @xmath0 .",
    "the precise behaviour of @xmath228 at large @xmath0 deserves further studies however .",
    "we thank b. amadon and s. biermann for useful discussions , and for sharing with us their recent qmc numerical results for this model .",
    "this work was supported by the nsf under grant nsf dmr 0096462 and by the pics program of the cnrs ( under contract pics 1062 ) .",
    "in this appendix , we provide a detailed proof that the corrections in @xmath65 to the atomic limit ( @xmath91 ) do not modify the large-@xmath0 dependence of the critical couplings .",
    "this is done by an explicit investigation of the structure of these corrections .",
    "moreover , we show that for @xmath93 ( i.e when @xmath2 is considered ) , these corrections only produce subdominant terms which can be ignored at large-@xmath0 .      for our purpose ,",
    "the operator @xmath68 can be written : @xmath267 ^2 \\\\",
    "\\nonumber h_{{{{\\mathrm{h}}}}}^1 & = &   { v_{{{{\\mathrm{h}}}}}}\\sum_{\\sigma } \\sum_{k } { c_{k,\\sigma}^{\\dagger}}{d_{\\sigma}}+ { d_{\\sigma}^{\\dagger}}{c_{k,\\sigma}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    first let us consider the ground state energy @xmath73 .",
    "as the lower hubbard band @xmath62 is filled in @xmath268 , we prefer to remove the constant contribution @xmath269 , so that the zeroth order energy is @xmath270 .",
    "the next order term @xmath271 is zero by conservation of the total charge @xmath173 on the @xmath75-level , so we need to look at the second order contribution : @xmath272 since @xmath273 can only possess a charge @xmath274 ( resp .",
    "@xmath275 ) for the @xmath75-electron and a hole ( resp . particule ) excitation in the bath .",
    "clearly as @xmath55 is negative ( positive ) for @xmath276 ( @xmath61 ) , the denominators are of order @xmath0 ( since @xmath277 ) and @xmath278 is therefore scaling as @xmath217 at large @xmath0 .",
    "we would like to infer this to be true at all order in the developement in @xmath65 .",
    "one can easily classify into two categories the intermediate states that appear at order @xmath279 and beyond .",
    "there can either be a charge different form @xmath173 on the impurity ( as in the previous computation at order @xmath280 ) and then the denominator coming from this state provides ( at least ) a factor @xmath281 by the presence of the coulomb energy @xmath127 . or the impurity can be found in a charge @xmath173 state ( with possibly a reorganization of the spin configuration ) without a coulomb energy cost .",
    "however this state possesses also many particle - hole excitations in the bath , and this leads to a denominator which scales as the mott gap @xmath58 . for example",
    "let us consider such a ket generated at order @xmath279 , like @xmath282 .",
    "this particular state ( but the argument is general ) , contributes a factor @xmath283 where @xmath276 and @xmath284 .",
    "this quantity is always smaller than @xmath285 because the mott gap @xmath58 is also the gap of the @xmath286 electrons ( through the self - consistency ) . as the gap @xmath58",
    "is expected to be of order @xmath127 when @xmath9 is close to @xmath2 , each particle - hole excitation also provides a factor @xmath281 in the perturbative expansion .",
    "this is enough to conclude that , at a given order in perturbation theory , each of the denominator gives a factor @xmath281 that balance the combinatorial factor coming from the string of charge excitation on the impurity level .",
    "thus @xmath287 is at most of order 1 when @xmath0 is large .",
    "we finally need to compute @xmath288 at large @xmath0 .",
    "let us consider first the case @xmath289 , so that @xmath290 and @xmath291 will differ by only one spin flip @xmath292 .",
    "we can now calculate at the lowest order in @xmath65 the desired matrix element : @xmath293 with @xmath294 the contribution at order @xmath295 is therefore : @xmath296 because @xmath297 and @xmath298 .",
    "all terms coming at order @xmath65 cancel by conservation of the charge , so we examine now the next leading order for @xmath299 , @xmath300 , which is composed of three terms : one from the correction by @xmath65 to each of the two external kets , one from the development of the denominator in ( [ eq : gamma ] ) at order @xmath280 , and a mixed term ( between only one ket correction and the denominator developed at first order ) .",
    "let us examine the first of these second order contributions : @xmath301 is composed of charge @xmath302 excitations ( with energy @xmath303 ) and of particle - hole excitations in the bath with a charge @xmath173 on the impurity ( this has the energy @xmath304 ) .",
    "both energies scale like @xmath0 and contribute an overall factor @xmath305 to @xmath306 .",
    "there is also a combinatorial factor of order @xmath0 coming from the choice in the spin - excitation in @xmath307 , but there is none from the state @xmath308 as the spin configuration in @xmath309 is fixed by the one in @xmath310 .",
    "therefore @xmath311 .",
    "the same argument works for the two other contribution at order @xmath280 .",
    "more generally , at a given order @xmath189 in the development in @xmath65 , each of the @xmath312 denominators provides a factor of order @xmath281 , because there is a finite gap @xmath313 between the two hubbard bands @xcite .",
    "however the string of @xmath189 spin - flips generated by the @xmath314 terms only contributes to an overall combinatorial factor at most @xmath315 because one has to connect two fixed external configurations @xmath316 and @xmath317 .",
    "hence in the limit of large @xmath0 all terms after the first one are sub - dominant , so that : @xmath318 meaning that the atomic result for @xmath299 is exact in the large-@xmath0 limit _ when @xmath93_.    at this stage , we want to stress _ a posteriori _ that the hypotheses made in the preceding argument are consistent with this result . first it is correct to fix the chemical potential @xmath29 from the atomic limit ( @xmath91 ) , because perturbative corrections do not change the occupancy of the @xmath75-orbital , as can be checked from a direct expansion in @xmath65 of @xmath319 .",
    "finally the existence of a large mott gap @xmath320 can also be justified on the same grounds .",
    "when @xmath321 on the other hand , the perturbative series for @xmath299 does not appear to stop after the first contribution , showing that @xmath1 is affected by @xmath65 in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "it is however straightforward to follow the line of arguments given in section [ sub : limitatomicexact ] to see that each term in this development provides a leading contribution of order @xmath322 ( using @xmath323 ) .",
    "@xmath299 can not be computed exactly in that case , because @xmath324 is now a non trivial function of @xmath325 at @xmath176 .",
    "but this is enough to conclude that @xmath326 is of order @xmath327 at large @xmath0 when @xmath321 , so that the result @xmath328 holds .",
    "however , an exact evaluation of @xmath96 appears to be a difficult task , even at @xmath176 .",
