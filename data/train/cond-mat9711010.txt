    "prevalent scenarios @xcite concerning realistic spin glasses require that the nature of the spin glass order parameter ( i.e. , the parisi overlap distribution ) and the structure of the thermodynamic states from which it is obtained be highly complex ; see , for example , refs .  @xcite .",
    "this complexity is asserted to be a consequence of the existence of many competing pure states . in previous papers",
    "@xcite we showed that the standard picture of this complex structure ( including non - self - averaging of the thermodynamic overlap distribution function , ultrametricity of distances among all pure states for fixed coupling realization , etc . ) can not hold in any finite dimension .",
    "however , at the same time we presented ( as a logical possibility ) a _ nonstandard _ mean field picture in which some of these features appear in finite - dimensional spin glasses but in a more limited sense  i.e. , in large finite volumes with coupling - independent boundary conditions such as periodic . in this picture",
    ", only a _ subset _ of all the pure states appears in each finite - volume mixed state ( which varies with volume ) ; those pure states along with their weights and overlaps retain some mean field structure .    in this paper , however , we provide both heuristic and rigorous arguments that indicate the state and overlap structure in finite volumes must in fact be relatively simple .",
    "this is so even if there are many pure states overall .",
    "these arguments preclude the possibility of any type of mean field structure  even the nonstandard , limited type  for the spin glass phase in finite dimensions .",
    "although the arguments and conclusions of this paper are applicable to fairly general examples of disordered systems , we will focus on the edwards - anderson ( ea ) ising spin glass @xcite .",
    "when there are many pure ( infinite volume ) states @xmath2 , it has been generally believed @xcite that the finite volume gibbs state @xmath3 ( for a coupling configuration @xmath4 in the cube @xmath5 of side @xmath6 centered at the origin with , say , periodic boundary conditions ) is ( approximately ) a mixture of many pure states : @xmath7 and the finite volume overlap distribution @xmath8 is ( approximately ) the corresponding mixture of many @xmath0-functions : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the overlap between the pure states @xmath11 and @xmath12 : @xmath13    of course , if there is only a single pair of pure states ( related by a global spin flip ) as in the droplet / scaling picture of refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) , then for each @xmath6 , @xmath8 will simply approximate a sum of two @xmath0-functions at @xmath1 .",
    "we will argue here that _ the same conclusion is true for the finite - volume overlap distributions even when there are many pure states_. this is because @xmath3 will still be approximately a mixture of a _ single _ pair of pure states , although now the choice of the pair will depend upon @xmath6 .",
    "this scenario was previously proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite as a logical possibility that followed from the metastate approach introduced in those papers . here",
    "we will argue that it is the only _ reasonable _ possibility consistent with many pure states , and we will also present new scaling arguments that provide a physical basis for it and at the same time explain its relation to the earlier and simpler two state droplet / scaling picture",
    ".    it is important to note that in computing overlap distributions as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pl ] ) , the region in which the computation is done should be small compared to the overall size of the system  i.e. , the system boundaries should be far from the region of interest .",
    "the reasons for this were discussed at some length in the appendix to ref .",
    "@xcite , and will be returned to in section  [ sec : pure ] .",
    "this guarantees that one is focusing on the thermodynamic states of the system @xcite and avoiding extraneous finite size and boundary effects .    with this understanding ,",
    "our arguments indicate that the nonstandard sk picture , introduced by us previously as the only remaining viable mean - field - like picture , is not valid in any dimension . the reader may wish to glance ahead at section  [ sec : invariance ] in which this conclusion , one of the main results of the paper , is presented .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : meta ]",
    "we review the concept of metastates . in section  [ sec : finite ] we discuss previously proposed scenarios for the spin glass phase , including the newer chaotic pairs and nonstandard sk pictures . in section  [ sec : invariance ] we present the first of our main results , a theorem on the invariance of the metastate with respect to flip - related boundary conditions , and then discuss the consequences of the theorem .",
    "we will see why this result should be incompatible with any but the simplest spin glass ordering , and in particular how that argues against the nonstandard sk picture . in section  [ sec : scaling ] we will provide a scaling basis for the chaotic pairs picture , and present one possible physical scenario under which it would occur . in section  [ sec : pure ] we discuss , in light of our results , the question of why some numerical experiments appear to see a complicated overlap structure .",
    "we further discuss appropriate procedures for computing overlap structures in finite volumes as a means of extracting at least partial information on ordering in the low temperature phase .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "for specificity , we will focus on the edwards - anderson ( ea ) model @xcite which , on a cubic lattice in @xmath14 dimensions , is described by the hamiltonian @xmath15 where @xmath4 denotes the set of couplings @xmath16 and where the brackets indicate that the sum is over nearest - neighbor pairs only , with the sites @xmath17 .",
    "we will take the spins @xmath18 to be ising , i.e. , @xmath19 ; although this will affect the details of our discussion , it is unimportant for our main conclusions .",
    "the couplings @xmath16 are quenched , independent , identically distributed random variables ; throughout the paper we will assume their common distribution to be symmetric about zero ( and usually with the variance fixed to be one ) .",
    "the most common examples are the gaussian and @xmath20 distributions .",
    "the infinite - ranged version of the ea model was introduced by sherrington and kirkpatrick @xcite and is commonly referred to as the sk model .",
    "numerical studies of spin glass overlap structure in the ea model study finite volume cubes with ( usually ) periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "a crucial property of disordered systems with many competing states is that , although particular pure states may be picked out by a special choice of boundary conditions depending on the disorder realization , such boundary conditions are not relevant for comparison to either experiments on physical spin glasses or to numerical simulations . in all of these cases",
    "boundary conditions are chosen _ independently _ of the coupling realization .    in this paper",
    "we will therefore focus on either fixed or periodic boundary conditions ( and their flip - related b.c.s ; see section  [ sec : invariance ] ) chosen independently of the couplings . from a theoretical point of view , observable properties in this situation are amenable to analysis by means of the metastate approach @xcite .",
    "metastates enable us to relate the observed behavior of a system in large but finite volumes with its thermodynamic properties .",
    "this relation is relatively straightforward for systems with few pure states or for those whose states are related by well - understood symmetry transformations ; but in the presence of many pure states not related by any obvious transformations , this relation may be subtle and complex . in these cases",
    "the metastate approach may be highly useful .",
    "one reason for this is that , in the presence of many competing pure states , a sequence as @xmath21 of finite - volume gibbs measures on cubes @xmath5 with coupling - independent b.c.s will generally _ not _ converge to a single limiting thermodynamic state @xcite .",
    "we call this phenomenon _ chaotic size dependence _ ( csd ) . in the metastate approach ,",
    "we exploit the presence of csd by replacing the study of single thermodynamic states ( as is conventionally done ) with an _ ensemble _ of ( pure or mixed ) thermodynamic states .",
    "this approach , based on an analogy to chaotic dynamical systems , enables us to construct a limiting measure , but it is a measure on the thermodynamic states themselves .",
    "this ( infinite - volume ) measure contains far more information than any single thermodynamic state .",
    "it has a particular usefulness in the context of the study of finite volumes because it carries  among other things  the following information .",
    "suppose that there exist many thermodynamic states in some ( fixed ) dimension and at some ( fixed ) temperature .",
    "then ( for example ) the periodic b.c .",
    "metastate ( constructed from an infinite sequence of finite - volume gibbs measures on cubes with periodic boundary conditions ) tells us the likelihood of appearance of any specified thermodynamic state , pure or mixed , in a typical large volume .",
    "more precisely , it provides a probability measure for all possible @xmath22-point correlation functions contained in a box centered at the origin whose sides are sufficiently far from any of the boundaries so that finite size effects do not appreciably affect the result .",
    "details on the construction and properties of the metastate were given in previous papers @xcite .",
    "here we simply recount some central features .",
    "the histogram , or empirical distribution approach , is a type of microcanonical ensemble which considers at fixed @xmath4 a sequence of volumes with specified b.c .",
    ", such as periodic . the resulting sequence of finite - volume gibbs states @xmath23 each is given weight @xmath24 .",
    "this `` histogram '' of finite - volume gibbs states converges to some @xmath25 as @xmath26 .",
    "the ( periodic b.c .",
    ", in this example ) metastate @xmath25 is a probability measure on thermodynamic states @xmath27 at fixed @xmath4 , and specifies the fraction of cube sizes that the system spends in each different ( possibly mixed ) thermodynamic state @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "an alternative ( and earlier ) construction of the metastate , in which the randomness of the couplings is used directly to generate an ensemble of states , was provided by aizenman and wehr @xcite . in this approach",
    "one considers the limiting joint distribution @xmath28 as @xmath21 .",
    "technical details can be found in @xcite .",
    "it can be proved that there exists at least a @xmath4-independent subsequence of volumes along which the two approaches ( empirical distribution and aizenman - wehr ) yield the _ same _ limiting metastate @xcite .",
    "this will be important in what follows @xcite .",
    "occasionally a distinction is drawn between finite- and infinite - volume states ( see , for example , @xcite ) , where it is argued that the first is more physical and the second merely mathematical in nature . while we have shown @xcite that the relation between the two may be more subtle than previously realized  at least in the case where many competing states are present",
    " we also argue that the distinction drawn above is misleading . indeed , it should be clear from the discussion above that the metastate approach is specifically constructed to consider both finite and infinite volumes together and to unify the two cases . in the next section , guided by this approach , we review various allowable scenarios for the ea spin glass phase .",
    "of the possible scenarios for spin glasses at low temperature , the simplest is that spin - flip symmetry is not broken at positive temperatures in any dimension",
    ". this would be the case if there were no phase transition at all and the paramagnetic state persisted to arbitrarily low temperatures .",
    "it would also be the case if there _ were _ a phase transition but the ea order parameter @xmath29 ( corresponding to the self - overlap of a pure state , i.e. , @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qab ] ) ) remained zero .",
    "such a phase might have , e.g. , single - site magnetizations equalling zero at low temperatures but two - spin correlation functions decaying as a power law at large distances",
    ".    more likely , however , is that spin - flip symmetry _ is _ broken for @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite . in that case",
    "the simplest scenario for the low - temperature spin glass phase is the fisher - huse scaling / droplet picture @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in which a single pair of pure states is present . in that case , with periodic b.c.s , csd is absent , and the metastate is concentrated on a single mixed thermodynamic state , with each of the two pure states having weight @xmath33 .",
    "this picture seems internally consistent .",
    "we now consider possible many - state pictures . in the standard sk picture",
    ", there is an overlap distribution @xmath34 that exhibits non - self - averaging ( nsa ) even after the thermodynamic limit has been taken @xcite ; that is , it fluctuates with @xmath4 even though it is a thermodynamic quantity .",
    "other features of this picture include ultrametricity among _ all _ pure state overlaps and a continuous part of @xmath35 ( the average of @xmath34 over all @xmath4 ) between @xmath1 . for details ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "however , this standard sk picture _ can not _ hold ( in any dimension and at any temperature ) @xcite because the translation invariance of @xmath34 combined with the translation ergodicity of the underlying distribution of couplings implies that @xmath34 must be self - averaged @xcite .",
    "this problem with the standard sk picture might sound like a mere mathematical technicality  for which one might hope to find a technical solution .",
    "but in fact this picture has an inherent conceptual flaw ",
    "namely the basic problem that a single state @xmath36 is simply not a rich enough description of the @xmath21 behavior of a thermodynamic system where csd occurs .",
    "in such a picture , one is in effect replacing with a single state all of the information contained in an entire distribution of states , i.e. , the metastate .",
    "we now consider two nonstandard pictures , each of which arises naturally in the context of the metastate approach and the possible presence of csd .",
    "the first of these resembles the fisher - huse picture in finite volumes , but has a very different thermodynamic structure .",
    "it is a many - state picture , but unlike in the mean - field picture each large volume ( with periodic boundary conditions ) `` sees '' essentially only one pair of states at a time ( in section  [ sec : pure ] we discuss what it means for a finite volume to `` see '' a thermodynamic state , pure or mixed ) . in other words , for large @xmath6",
    ", one finds that @xmath37 where @xmath38 refers to the global spin - flip of pure state @xmath11 . here",
    ", the pure state pair ( of the infinitely many present ) appearing in finite volume depends chaotically on @xmath6 . unlike the droplet / scaling picture , this new possibility exhibits csd with periodic b.c.s . in this",
    "`` chaotic pairs '' picture the ( periodic b.c . ) metastate is dispersed over ( infinitely ) many @xmath27 s , of the form @xmath39 .",
    "the overlap distribution for each @xmath27 is the same : @xmath40 . like the fisher - huse picture",
    ", this scenario also seems internally consistent .",
    "it is interesting to note that a highly disordered spin glass model @xcite ( see also @xcite ) appears to display just this behavior in its ground state structure in sufficiently high dimension .",
    "the last picture we discuss is a nonstandard sk - like picture that resembles the standard sk picture in finite volumes , but has an altogether different thermodynamic structure .",
    "this picture , which also assumes infinitely many pure states , organizes them such that each @xmath41 .",
    "the metastate @xmath25 is dispersed over many such @xmath27 s , so that different @xmath27 s again appear in different volumes , leading to csd . unlike the chaotic pairs picture , each @xmath42 depends on @xmath27 ( because each @xmath27 is now itself a nontrivial mixture of infinitely many pure states ) .",
    "however , the ensemble of @xmath42 s ( like the single @xmath43 of the standard sk picture ) does _ not _ depend on @xmath4 ( again because of translation invariance / ergodicity ) .",
    "so the conventional meaning of nsa  thermodynamic quantities such as the overlap distribution depending on @xmath4  is replaced by a new notion : not dependence on @xmath4 but rather dependence on the state @xmath27 within the metastate for fixed @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , ultrametricity of overlaps among pure states may be present within individual @xmath27 s , but not for all of the pure states taken together .",
    "a more detailed description of this nonstandard sk picture is given in refs .",
    "@xcite .    given the results of @xcite ,",
    "the nonstandard sk picture is the only remaining viable mean - field - like picture .",
    "we have presented preliminary arguments ( based on the invariance of the ensemble of @xmath42 s with respect to @xmath4 ; we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) that already cast some doubt on its validity , by demonstrating that the nonstandard sk picture requires an enormous number of constraints to be simultaneously satisfied . in the next section we present further arguments",
    "that more strongly rule it out as a viable possibility .",
    "the main result of this section is a theorem on the invariance of the metastate @xmath25 with respect to boundary conditions that are flip - related .",
    "two ( sequences of ) b.c.s are flip - related if , for each finite @xmath6 , there is some subset of the boundary @xmath44 whose flip transforms one b.c .  for that @xmath6 into the other .",
    "an obvious example of flip - related boundary conditions are periodic and antiperiodic ; a second example is any two fixed boundary conditions , i.e. , where each spin on the boundary is specified .",
    "on the other hand , periodic and fixed b.c.s are not flip - related .    in the following theorem",
    "we continue to assume that the common distribution of the couplings @xmath16 is symmetric about zero , i.e. , that @xmath16 has the same distribution as @xmath45 , and that the external field is zero .",
    "_ theorem .",
    "_ consider two metastates constructed ( at fixed , arbitrary dimension and temperature , and using either the histogram method or the aizenman - wehr method ) using two different boundary conditions , with neither depending on @xmath46 , on an infinite ( @xmath47 ) sequence of cubes @xmath48 . if the two different sequences of boundary conditions are flip - related , then the two metastates are the same ( with probability one  i.e. , for almost every @xmath4 ) .    _",
    "_ we use the fact , discussed above , that along some @xmath4-independent subsequence of volumes both the histogram construction of metastates and the aizenman - wehr construction have a limit , and that limit is the same . because the aizenman - wehr construction averages over couplings `` at infinity '' ( for details , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , it rigorously follows ( using gauge transformation arguments like those used in the proof of theorem 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the two metastates must be the same .",
    "this is a striking result ( despite the brevity of the proof ) , with important physical consequences .",
    "it says , for example , that the periodic b.c .",
    "metastate @xmath25 must be the same as the _ antiperiodic _ b.c .",
    "in fact , if one were to choose ( independently of @xmath4 ) two _ arbitrary _ sequences of periodic and antiperiodic b.c.s , the metastates ( with probability one ) would _ still _ be identical . in other words , the metastate ( and corresponding overlap distributions constructed from it ) at fixed temperature and dimension is highly _ insensitive _ to boundary conditions .    to appreciate the implications of this ,",
    "consider the histogram construction of the metastate .",
    "the invariance of the metastate with respect to different sequences of periodic and antiperiodic b.c.s means that the frequency of appearance ( in finite volumes ) of various thermodynamic states is ( with probability one ) _",
    "independent _ of the choice of boundary conditions .",
    "moreover , this same invariance property holds ( with probability one ) among any two sequences of _ fixed _ boundary conditions ( and the fixed boundary condition of choice may even be allowed to vary arbitrarily along any single sequence of volumes ) !",
    "it follows that , with respect to changes of boundary conditions , the metastate is highly robust .    of course",
    ", the insensitivity of the metastate with respect to changes of boundary conditions would be unsurprising if there were only a single thermodynamic state ( e.g. , paramagnetic ) or a single pair of flip - related states as in the droplet picture .",
    "but it is difficult to see how our result can be reconciled with the presence of _ many _ thermodynamic states ; indeed , at first glance it would appear to rule them out .    nevertheless , we argue below that our theorem does _ not _ rule out the existence of many states , but clearly puts severe constraints on the form of the metastate ( and overlap distribution function , which also possesses this invariance property ) .",
    "our heuristic conclusion is that , in light of this strong invariance property , any metastate constructed via coupling - independent b.cs can support only a very simple structure . as a consequence",
    ", we will argue that this theorem effectively rules out the nonstandard sk picture .    to see that an _ uncountable _ set of pure states",
    "is not ruled out ( we will discuss countably infinite sets below ) , consider the highly disordered ground state model @xcite in high dimensions , which is believed to exhibit a version of the chaotic pairs picture with uncountably many states .",
    "our invariance theorem applies to this model also , and so ( e.g. ) the periodic and antiperiodic metastates must be the same , even though we might _ a priori _ expect them to be different . by what mechanism",
    "could this happen ?",
    "the most natural possibility is that both the periodic and antiperiodic b.c .",
    "metastates are the same as the free b.c .",
    "metastate @xcite in which all relative signs between the different trees in the invasion forest ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) are equally likely .",
    "that is , each of these metastates consists of a _ uniform distribution _ on the ground state pairs .",
    "given that , it does nt seem unreasonable that all sorts of different b.c.s should give rise to a similar uniform distribution .",
    "indeed , any fixed b.c .",
    "_ does _ give a uniform distribution on all _ single _ ground states @xcite .",
    "but this line of reasoning does appear to rule out the chaotic pairs picture with a _",
    "countable _ infinity of states . in that case",
    ", of course , one ca nt have a uniform distribution ( i.e. , all equal , positive weights within the metastate ) .",
    "so now suppose that for some @xmath4 the periodic b.c .",
    "metastate assigns , for example , probability .39 to one pair of pure states , .28 to another , and so on .",
    "in other words , with periodic b.c.s 39% of the finite cubes prefer pair number 1 , 28% prefer pair number 2 , etc .",
    "so pair number 1 is the overall `` winner '' ( among different finite volumes ) in the periodic b.c",
    ".  popularity vote .",
    "it now seems clear heuristically , though , that the popularity vote by _",
    "antiperiodic b.c.s_ should come out differently ; it is unreasonable to suppose that pair number 1 be preferred by 39% of the periodic b.c .",
    "cubes and at the same time by 39% of the antiperiodic b.c .",
    "the uniform distribution conclusion seems even more inevitable when one considers that analogous arguments also apply to pairs of arbitrarily chosen sequences of _ fixed _ boundary conditions .",
    "we conclude that consistency between our invariance theorem and the existence of ( uncountably ) many states requires , in some sense , an equal likelihood of the appearance ( in the metastate ) of all states , i.e. , some sort of uniform distribution on them .",
    "let us examine this further .",
    "we ve already noted that different sequences of volumes with fixed b.c.s  i.e. , all volumes having plus boundary conditions , all volumes having plus on some boundary faces and minus on others , all volumes with each boundary spin chosen by the flip of a fair coin , and so on  result in the same metastate .",
    "we note for future reference that the term `` chaotic pairs '' , which was chosen in reference to spin - symmetric b.c.s ( such as periodic ) should be replaced here by `` chaotic pure states '' ; i.e. , in this picture , the gibbs state in a typical large volume @xmath5 with fixed b.c.s will be ( approximately ) a single pure state that varies chaotically with @xmath6 .",
    "but we expect that the mixed state @xmath36 , which is the _ average _ over the metastate @xcite @xmath49 would be the same for periodic and fixed b.c.s .",
    "one can also think of this @xmath36 as the average thermodynamic state , @xmath50 , in the limit @xmath26 .",
    "now consider the mixed boundary condition in which _ every _ fixed b.c .",
    "on the boundary of each @xmath5 is given equal weight .",
    "if there are ( uncountably ) many pure states present , then in a typical large volume one would expect to see a gibbs state which approximates a continuous mixture over the pure states ( cf .",
    "possibility 3 or 4 discussed in ref .",
    "but we still expect that the average over the mixed b.c .",
    "metastate would be the same @xmath36 as for the fixed b.c .",
    "metastate , the periodic b.c .",
    "metastate , and so on .",
    "that is , the average over the metastate should be even more robust than the metastate itself , i.e. , it should be the same for metastates constructed through _ any _ two sequences of ( coupling - independent ) b.c.s , not just flip - related ones .",
    "although logically possible , it seems unreasonable that this last ( mixed b.c .",
    "with all fixed b.c.s given equal weight ) metastate , chosen from a maximally uniform mixture of boundary conditions , can have anything other than a uniform distribution over the pure states .",
    "but , as just pointed out , this distribution should be the same for this as for all the other metastates under discussion .",
    "( we caution the reader that , unlike the case of the strongly disordered model @xcite , we do not have a precise sense in which this distribution can be defined to be uniform .",
    "for that reason , this part of the argument must be regarded as heuristic . )    with these points in mind , we now turn to a discussion of the nonstandard sk picture , and other possible mixed state scenarios .",
    "the nonstandard sk picture requires ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : sum ] ) ) that the @xmath27 s appearing in the metastate be of the form @xmath51 , with at least some subset of the weights @xmath52 in each @xmath27 nonzero and unequal .",
    "we would then have a situation like the following . with periodic b.c.s , say , the fraction of @xmath53 s for which the finite volume gibbs state in @xmath54 puts ( e.g. ) at least 84% of its weight in one pair of pure states ( but with that pair not specified ) is 0.39 .",
    "but then it must also be the case that with antiperiodic b.c.s the fraction of volumes for which the finite volume gibbs state puts at least 84% of its weight in some unspecified pair is still exactly 0.39 !",
    "moreover , the same argument must apply to any `` cut '' one might care to make ; i.e. , one constructs the periodic b.c .",
    "metastate and finds that @xmath55 of all finite volumes have put @xmath56 of their weight in @xmath57 states , with @xmath57 depending on the ( arbitrary ) choice of @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    ". then this must be true also for all volumes with antiperiodic b.cs ; and similarly ( but possibly separately ) among all pairs of fixed b.c .",
    "states .",
    "once again , the only sensible way in which this could happen would be for the selection of states to be relatively insensitive ( in some global sense ) to the choice of boundary conditions , i.e. , for the b.c.s to choose the states in some `` democratic '' fashion without favoritism so that @xmath36 , the average over the metastate , should be some sort of uniform mixture of the pure states , as before .",
    "however , unlike in the chaotic pairs picture discussed earlier , we claim that this _ can not _ happen when the @xmath27 s are ( nontrivial ) mixed states .",
    "the reason for this is that the metastate has a strong covariance property @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in which the @xmath27 s must transform in a specified way under an arbitrary finite change in the coupling realization . under this finite change , the ensemble @xmath60 transforms ( as would any probability measure ) according to the change of variables @xmath61 . here , @xmath62 is the thermodynamic state with correlations @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the change in the hamiltonian .    under this change of variables , pure states remain pure and their overlaps do nt change .",
    "however , the weights which appear in each @xmath27 _ will _ in general change , as one would expect . to see this ,",
    "consider a particular @xmath27 having a discrete pure state decomposition @xmath65 with many nonzero weights @xmath66 .",
    "suppose that one chooses a particular coupling @xmath16 and imposes the transformation @xmath67 .",
    "then the weight @xmath68 ( within @xmath27 ) of the pure state @xmath11 will transform for each @xmath11 as @xmath69 where @xmath70    in either the droplet / scaling or the chaotic pairs picture , there are in each @xmath27 only two pure states ( depending on @xmath27 in chaotic pairs ) , each with weight @xmath33 . because all even correlations are the same in each pair of ( flip - related ) pure states , the transformation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : walpha ] ) leaves the weights unchanged .",
    "however , in nonstandard sk there exist pure states within each ( mixed ) @xmath27 with relative domain walls , so that they differ in at least some even correlation functions .",
    "but this then rules out that @xmath36 must always be a uniform mixture of the pure states , because a suitable change of couplings will shift the weights for each @xmath27 in such a way that the distribution over pure states of @xmath36 also shifts .",
    "( this reasoning can be made rigorous , but because other parts of the argument are heuristic , we omit a proof . )    in other words , we argued above that the invariance of the metastate with respect to boundary conditions left open , as the only reasonable possibility for the presence of many pure states , that @xmath36 , the average over the metastate , be some sort of uniform mixture over the pure states .",
    "this must be true for any @xmath4 ( with probability one ) , so the weight distribution over all pure states must also be invariant with respect to changes in @xmath4 .",
    "but this invariance is inconsistent with the transformation properties of the @xmath27 s with respect to finite changes in @xmath4 : if there are multiple pure states in the @xmath27 s , with the pure states in each @xmath27 not having the same even correlations ( i.e. , they have relative domain walls ) , then their relative weights must vary ( as expected ) with changes in the coupling realization .",
    "this leads to a contradiction , and therefore rules out not only nonstandard sk but any picture in which the @xmath27 s are a nontrivial mixture of pure states .",
    "our conclusion , based on the above combination of both rigorous results and heuristic arguments , is that the nonstandard sk picture can not be valid in any dimension and at any temperature .",
    "more generally , the many invariances of the spin glass metastate can not support _ any _ picture in which thermodynamic mixed states ( other than a single flip - related pair ) are seen in finite volumes .",
    "given that the only reasonable possibilities remaining ( that display broken spin flip symmetry ) are the droplet / scaling picture and the chaotic pairs picture , we conclude that the overlap distribution function @xmath71 @xmath72 can at most be a pair of @xmath0-functions at @xmath1 for each @xmath27 ; i.e. , in each finite volume the overlap between pure states that appear in that volume is just that pair of @xmath0-functions .",
    "this will be the case regardless of whether there is only a single pair or uncountably many pairs of pure states .",
    "we will discuss this further in section  [ sec : pure ] , but first we turn to another topic .    in the next section we present a simple scaling approach that provides both a plausibility argument and also a physical starting point for understanding the `` chaotic pairs '' many - state picture introduced in refs .",
    "it is important to note that this scaling picture is consistent with the fisher - huse droplet picture @xcite for appropriate values of the new scaling exponents , but for other values can give rise to a different thermodynamic picture .",
    "we have argued above that with periodic boundary conditions , one should see at most a single pair of flip - related pure states in a large volume .",
    "as already discussed , this leaves open the possibilities of either a single pure state ( e.g. , but not necessarily , a paramagnet ) , a single pair of pure states ( as in the droplet picture ) , or the chaotic pairs many - state picture discussed above .",
    "we now present a simple extension of earlier scaling / droplet arguments @xcite which is consistent with this last possibility , and also provides a possible scenario for the spatial structure of domain wall configurations among the ground states .",
    "the object here is to obtain estimates on the difference in energy or free energy between the lowest - lying state in a fixed volume and the next higher one .",
    "the appearance at nonzero temperature of multiple ( non - spin - flip related ) states in a single ( large ) volume requires that the energies of the lowest - lying states differ by order one . if , on the other hand , the `` minimal '' energy difference scales as some positive power of the system size , then one will see at most a single pair of states in any given box ( with spin - symmetric boundary conditions , such as periodic ) .    to analyze the appearance in finite volumes , and at very low temperature , of infinite volume pure states , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum ] ) , we will consider infinite volume _ ground _ states restricted to the cube of size @xmath6 , with a fixed boundary condition @xmath73 chosen independently of the couplings . in our analysis below",
    "we will treat the boundary spins as chosen randomly and independently of the couplings  but for a nonrandom fixed b.c .  such as plus , the same arguments go through with minor modifications .    although there may a priori be infinitely many infinite volume ground states , the number of distinct restrictions to the cube is finite and its logarithm should be of order @xmath74 for some @xmath75 . the scaling exponent @xmath75 ( with @xmath76 ) may be understood in another way : the minimum number of spins on the surface of the cube that differ between two infinite volume ground states , whose spins disagree at ( or near ) the origin @xcite , should scale as @xmath77",
    ". these two states should correspondingly differ in the bulk by a number of spins of ( at least ) order @xmath78 .",
    "if there exists only a single pair of flip - related ground states ( as argued in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , then @xmath79 . in the highly disordered spin glass model of refs .  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it appears that @xmath79 below eight dimensions while @xmath80 above eight dimensions .",
    "let us examine the exponent @xmath75 more closely .",
    "although _ a priori _ there seems to be no reason to exclude the possibility that @xmath81 , there are several arguments indicating otherwise .",
    "( note also that @xmath81 would saturate the possible growth rate of the number of distinguishable ground states in any finite volume since the logarithm of this number can not exceed order @xmath82 . )",
    "if @xmath81 , then spins living in regions between domain walls would exist in one - dimensional tube - like objects .",
    "it seems very unlikely that such tubes could be stable ; i.e. , eventually such a tube should encounter a fluctuation which destroys its structure .",
    "a second and somewhat different argument uses the fact that @xmath75 should be bounded from below by the exponent @xmath83 introduced by fisher and huse @xcite , which governs the minimal interface free energy between different pure states on a length scale @xmath6 ; i.e. , this minimal free energy is presumed to grow as @xmath84 .",
    "it is not difficult to see , then , that @xmath85 .",
    "however , it was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite that the inequality @xmath86 is necessary in order for spin flip symmetry to be broken at positive temperature . in what follows",
    "we therefore always assume that @xmath87 .    before considering the ea model itself ,",
    "we first treat the much simpler case of a homogeneous ising ferromagnet with fixed b.c.s chosen at random .",
    "first we consider the energy difference between the plus and minus ground states ( with interface ground states temporarily not considered ) . here",
    "there is no bulk energy difference , and @xmath79 . because of the randomness of the b.c .",
    ", the boundary energy difference is of order @xmath88 .",
    "the conclusion in this case @xcite ( see also @xcite ) is that the total energy difference is also @xmath88 and thus with random b.c.s one does not see a mixture of the plus and minus states but only one of them ( chosen by the sign of the boundary energy ) chaotically changing with @xmath6 .",
    "what about seeing interface states ? here , the appropriate bulk energy difference between the constant ground states and the interface states scales as @xmath82 ( with @xmath75 the same as before ) and so the bulk energy difference dominates the boundary energy difference . in this case",
    "the total energy difference between the homogeneous state and the lowest - lying interface state is of order @xmath82 . as a result ,",
    "all interface states are `` invisible '' in the random b.c .  finite volume ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "we now consider the ea ising spin glass from this point of view .",
    "that is , we consider the energies of the restrictions of all infinite volume ground states to the @xmath89 cube centered at the origin .",
    "as before , we divide the energy into a bulk and a boundary part , and ask how the energy difference between the lowest - energy and next - lowest - energy state scales with @xmath6 . consider the state @xmath90 with minimum total energy ( subject to the fixed boundary condition ) and the state of next lowest energy that differs from @xmath90 near the origin . by the definition of @xmath75 , the two states differ by at least @xmath78 spins in the bulk and by @xmath77 spins on the boundary .    to estimate the energy differences between low lying states",
    ", we will separately consider the boundary energy coming from the couplings between @xmath73 and the adjacent spins in the cube , and the bulk energy difference ( from the remainder of the finite volume hamiltonian ) .",
    "if there were no bulk energies to consider , then one might expect that two states which differ by @xmath77 spins on the boundary would typically differ by an overall energy of order @xmath88 .",
    "if this were indeed the case for the two lowest - lying states in almost any volume , then one would see only one state per volume ( for fixed boundary conditions ) .",
    "however , since one is doing a minimization problem which includes bulk energies as well , it is not at all obvious _ a priori _ that this will happen .",
    "in particular , there might be some delicate cancellation between bulk and boundary energies .",
    "we will now , however , present a specific scenario in which an explicit calculation shows that the lowest - lying states , in a volume with fixed boundary conditions chosen independently of the couplings , do indeed have an energy difference of order @xmath88 .",
    "this example is presented as a plausibility argument and demonstrates one way in which this can occur , but is not meant to imply that it can occur in _ only _ this way .",
    "consider then a scenario in which the spin at the origin belongs to a cluster , not intersected by _ any _ domain walls , whose intersection with the boundary as before is of size @xmath77 .",
    "we denote that cluster @xmath91 .",
    "suppose further that @xmath2 is a general infinite volume ground state , and that @xmath92 is the energy  including both the boundary and bulk components  of @xmath93 restricted to @xmath5 , the @xmath89 cube centered at the origin .",
    "the energy @xmath92 can therefore be written @xmath94 where the first term is the contribution from the spins in the cluster @xmath91 on the boundary @xmath44 , the second term is the surface energy contribution from all other boundary spins , and the final term is the energy contribution of the bulk spins .",
    "more precisely , @xmath44 is the set of sites @xmath58 inside @xmath5 with a nearest neighbor @xmath59 outside @xmath44 and @xmath95 is the boundary spin @xmath96 times @xmath16 . eq .",
    "( [ eq : el ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath97 where three new variables have been introduced : @xmath98 represents the sign of the spin at the origin in ground state @xmath11 , @xmath99 is ( approximately ) a gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance , and @xmath100 depends both on the bulk energy of @xmath11 and on the rest of the boundary spins ( i.e. , those not included in the first term ) .    in going from eq .",
    "( [ eq : el ] ) to ( [ eq : twoterms ] ) we used the fact that the boundary condition consists of fixed random spins , chosen independently of @xmath11 .",
    "the crucial observation is that the random variables @xmath99 , which arise from the random boundary conditions , are independent of the spectrum of the ( mostly ) bulk energies @xmath100 .",
    "we now show that , regardless of the number and distribution of the @xmath100 s as @xmath11 varies , there will be no strong cancellations between the two terms ( with probability close to one ) .",
    "consider the ground state whose energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : el ] ) is the minimum , and also the ground state which has the next higher energy , and is _ required _ to have a relative spin flip with respect to the lowest energy state at the origin .",
    "we then have @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the bulk plus remainder boundary energies of the two lowest - lying states with a relative spin flip at the origin .    since @xmath99 and @xmath104 are functions of _ disjoint _ sets of the random boundary spins , they are independent random variables .",
    "hence , variances add and the effect of @xmath104 on the random variable @xmath105 can only be to _ increase _ the spread of its distribution .",
    "this allows us to conclude that with probability close to one ( i.e. , for most choices of the boundary spins ) the expression on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) is of order ( at least ) @xmath106 , i.e. , of order @xmath88 .",
    "as long as @xmath107 , which is part of our scenario , this growth with @xmath6 in the spacing of the low - lying spectrum of ground states argues for the appearance at small positive temperature of only a single pure state in large finite volume gibbs states with fixed b.c.s ( that are independent of the couplings ) .    the above argument is instructive in several respects .",
    "it demonstrates that , given the condition that no domain wall separates the origin from the boundary of the box , there can be no miraculous `` conspiracy '' under which bulk and boundary energies cancel out to order one .",
    "it does require a strong condition , namely that all domain walls , in the union of all symmetric differences over all ground states , do not form any closed and bounded regions .",
    "as stated above , this is a _ sufficient _ condition for the scaling argument given above to work , but we see no reason at this point why it should be a _",
    "necessary _ condition in order for the conclusions to be valid .",
    "nevertheless , it provides one interesting scenario for the spatial structure of ground states and domain walls if many states should exist .",
    "interestingly , in the only example of which we re aware in which a finite dimensional spin glass apparently _ does _ possess many states in high dimensions  the highly disordered ground state model of refs .",
    "@xcite  exactly this structure occurs !",
    "these considerations provide a possibly fruitful avenue for future investigations .",
    "in this section we address what it actually means , in an operational sense , to `` see '' a pure state  which formally is an infinite volume object  inside a finite volume .",
    "we then use that analysis to answer a glaring question : if states and overlaps in finite volumes are restricted to , at most , a single pair of flip - related pure states and a pair of @xmath0-functions at @xmath1 , respectively , then what are the many numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) and experiments ( @xcite ) that appear to see a more complicated state and overlap structure actually seeing ?    our main point will be that pure state structure can and does manifest itself in finite volumes , and governs the physics at finite length scales .",
    "conversely , observations made in large , finite volumes must in turn reveal the thermodynamic structure and the nature of ordering of the system  if sufficient care is given to the analysis of those observations .",
    "indeed , were both the above statements not true , it would be difficult to see why the study of thermodynamics would be of any interest to physics .",
    "while the above assertions have long been noncontroversial for most statistical mechanical systems and models , there remains considerable confusion in the case of spin glasses @xcite .",
    "at least part of the problem is that reliance on the overlap structure alone can at best give only partial  and sometimes misleading  information on the thermodynamics of realistic spin glass models @xcite .",
    "a second problem is that , as we have emphasized in previous papers @xcite , the connection between finite- and infinite - volume behavior may be more complex and subtle in spin glasses than in simpler systems .",
    "an analysis of this connection thus deserves more thought than a simple attempt to sever the link altogether between the two behaviors ( as in appendix i of @xcite ) .",
    "so in this section we will expand on previous discussions @xcite to further clarify these issues .    a thermal state , whether pure or mixed , is completely specified by the set of all of its ( 1-point , 2-point , 3-point , @xmath108 ) correlation functions . in a finite volume",
    ", a state will manifest itself through the appearance of a particular set of such correlations . because boundary effects will invariably alter or distort ( compared to an infinite - volume state ) these correlations in some region",
    "( whose size will depend on the specifics of the hamiltonian , temperature , dimension , etc . )",
    ", one must always be careful to examine them in a volume small enough so that these `` distortion '' effects are negligible .",
    "in other words , the boundary should be sufficiently far from the region under examination so that an accurate picture of the thermodynamics can be obtained @xcite .",
    "so , for example , even in the paramagnetic state , one would measure nonzero magnetizations at interior sites in the vicinity of a boundary on which all spins are fixed ( e.g. , to be @xmath109 ) . as the boundary moves farther out",
    ", subsequent measurements at those same sites would find their magnetization tending to zero .",
    "it is not unusual , even for comparatively simple systems , for boundary effects to penetrate more deeply into the interior than a shallow `` boundary layer '' .",
    "consider the example of the two - dimensional uniform ising ferromagnet .",
    "it is known @xcite that this system has only two pure states  the translationally invariant positive and negative magnetization states  for all @xmath110 .",
    "suppose now that on a square of side @xmath6 one were to impose fixed boundary conditions such that all spins on the right half of the boundary are @xmath109 and all spins on the left are @xmath111 .",
    "this will impose a domain wall on the system , whose maximum ( and typical ) deviation ( from the vertical line passing through the origin ) will scale as @xmath112 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "so for all large @xmath6 the system gives the _ appearance _ of having a pure state with a domain wall @xcite ; indeed , the domain wall always stays quite far from the ( vertical ) boundaries . however , if one were to look at _ any _ fixed , finite region , then as the size @xmath6 of the square grows , the domain wall eventually moves outside the fixed region , and one would see only a mixture of the positive and negative translationally invariant states .",
    "the ( equal , in this case , as @xmath21 ) weights in the mixture correspond to the probabilities of the domain wall thermally fluctuating to the left or to the right of the fixed region .",
    "so in this example the domain wall is an artifact of the imposed boundary condition , and has nothing to do with any thermodynamic structure or low - temperature ordering properties of the system .",
    "moreover , consideration of the spin configurations over the entire square would lead to incorrect conclusions about the pure state structure .",
    "this illustrates our contention that _ in order to arrive at an accurate picture of the thermodynamic structure and the nature of ordering of a system , one must focus attention on a fixed `` window '' near the origin ( which may be arbitrarily large , but is small compared to the entire volume under consideration ) . _    this conclusion is especially important when evaluating , and drawing inferences from , overlap functions . a more detailed discussion is given in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite , to which we refer the reader ; here we will only reiterate an illuminating example due to van  enter @xcite , which in turn extends an earlier example due to huse and fisher @xcite . consider the overlap distribution of an ising antiferromagnet in two dimensions with periodic boundary conditions . for odd - sized squares the overlap is equivalent ( by the obvious gauge transformation ) to that of the ferromagnet with periodic boundary conditions , and for even - sized squares it is equivalent to that of the ferromagnet with antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "if the overlap distribution were computed in the _ full _ square , it would therefore oscillate between two different answers ( one a sum of two @xmath0-functions at plus or minus the square of @xmath113 , the spontaneous magnetization , and the other a continuous distribution between @xmath114 ) .",
    "on the other hand , computing overlaps in boxes which are much smaller than the system size would give rise in this example to a well - defined answer  i.e. , the two @xmath0-function overlap distribution  which provides a more accurate picture of the nature of ordering in this system .    with these remarks in mind",
    ", we now turn to the finite - dimensional ising ea spin glass .",
    "essentially all the simulations of which we are aware compute the overlap distribution in the _ entire _ box .",
    "boundary conditions are chosen independently of the couplings , and are usually periodic . given our conclusion that , under these circumstances , at most a pair of flip - related pure states will appear in almost any finite volume , we suspect that the overlaps computed over the entire box are observing domain wall effects arising solely from the imposed boundary conditions , rather than revealing the actual spin glass ordering .",
    "( this is the reason why in section  [ sec : scaling ] we looked only at states with relative domain walls in the vicinity of the origin . )    in other words , if overlap computations were measured in `` small '' windows far from any boundary , one should find only a pair of @xmath0-functions .",
    "one way to test this would be to fix a region at the origin , and do successive overlap computations in that fixed region for increasingly larger boxes with imposed periodic boundary conditions ; as the boundaries move farther away , the overlap distribution within the fixed region should tend toward a pair of @xmath0-functions @xcite .",
    "it is important to clear up one other misconception .",
    "it was asserted at the end of section  2 in ref .",
    "@xcite that `` after ref .",
    "@xcite one has to argue that the physics must change after some very large length scale ... in order to claim that the mean field limit is not a good starting point to study the realistic case of finite dimensional models ... '' .",
    "although , of course , this changeover may well occur , it is at least as likely that it does nt @xcite , and that nontrivial overlaps will be seen for all large @xmath6 ( as the uniform ferromagnet domain wall example illustrates ) .",
    "the real problem is in some sense the opposite : namely , that overlap computations are not being done in _ small _ enough regions to provide an accurate picture of spin glass ordering .",
    "in our previous papers @xcite , we showed that spin glasses may be more complex  in the relation between their behavior in finite and infinite volumes  than had previously been noted in the literature . in the present paper , we have presented arguments indicating that , in a different sense , spin glasses are more _ simple _ than had previously been claimed in much of the literature .",
    "our main conclusion is that , for realistic spin glass models such as ising edwards - anderson , any large finite volume ( with say spin - symmetric b.c.s , such as periodic , chosen independently of the couplings ) will display at most a single pair of flip - related pure states .",
    "this may correspond to either a single pair of pure states in total , as in the droplet / scaling picture @xcite , or to the `` chaotic pairs '' picture introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and elaborated upon in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this rules out the nonstandard sk picture also introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and elaborated upon in refs .",
    "@xcite . combined with our",
    "earlier result @xcite ruling out the standard sk picture , we conclude that _ the thermodynamic structure and the nature of spin glass ordering , whether in finite or infinite volumes , can not be mean - field - like in any dimension and at any temperature_.    the argument leading to this conclusion followed a theorem , presented in section  [ sec : invariance ] , that the metastate for fixed @xmath4 is invariant with respect to arbitrary choices of flip - related boundary conditions ( such as periodic and antiperiodic ) .",
    "it was then argued that only the simplest pure state ( and corresponding overlap ) structures could be so robust @xcite .",
    "the only reasonable scenario under which ( uncountably ) many states could then appear is that , statistically , the states are insensitive to the boundary conditions .",
    "that is , the metastates would be generated ( as in the highly disordered ground state model ) through some kind of random fair - coin - tossing process .",
    "we argued in section  [ sec : pure ] that overlap computations should be done in small interior boxes ( surrounded by much larger boxes where the boundary conditions are actually imposed ) in order to remove boundary effects and get a picture of spin glass ordering that is not misleading .",
    "we expect that ( with periodic b.c.s ) for those dimensions and temperatures where @xmath115 , this procedure would result in a single pair of @xmath0-functions at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we also presented in section  [ sec : scaling ] a scaling argument that shows how a `` chaotic pairs '' ( or chaotic pure states , under fixed b.c.s ) picture can arise .",
    "we provided an explicit calculation that supported this picture under the sufficient ( but not necessary ) condition that the union of domain walls between _ all _ pairs of pure states form no closed and bounded regions .",

    "<S> we present a combination of heuristic and rigorous arguments indicating that both the pure state structure and the overlap structure of realistic spin glasses should be relatively simple : in a large finite volume with coupling - independent boundary conditions , such as periodic , at most a pair of flip - related ( or the appropriate number of symmetry - related in the non - ising case ) states appear , and the parisi overlap distribution correspondingly exhibits at most a pair of @xmath0-functions at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this rules out the nonstandard sk picture introduced by us earlier , and when combined with our previous elimination of more standard versions of the mean field picture , argues against the possibility of even limited versions of mean field ordering in realistic spin glasses . </S>",
    "<S> if broken spin flip symmetry should occur , this leaves open two main possibilities for ordering in the spin glass phase : the droplet / scaling two - state picture , and the chaotic pairs many - state picture introduced by us earlier . </S>",
    "<S> we present scaling arguments which provide a possible physical basis for the latter picture , and discuss possible reasons behind numerical observations of more complicated overlap structures in finite volumes . </S>"
