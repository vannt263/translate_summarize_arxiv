    "in recent years there has been an extensive experimental and theoretical activity in the field of magnetoelectrics . the magnetoelectric effect ( me )",
    "was originally predicted by curie in 1894,@xcite and describes the induction of electric polarization @xmath2 by a magnetic field and , vice - versa , the induction of magnetization @xmath12 by an electric field @xmath13 .",
    "a phenomenological theory was developed by landau,@xcite who considered the invariants in the expansion of the free energy up to linear terms in the magnetic field . in this approach",
    ", symmetry considerations alone can fix the form of the coupling between @xmath2 and @xmath12.@xcite based on such symmetry arguments , dzyaloshinskii proposed the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) compound cr@xmath0o@xmath1 as a first candidate for the observation of the me effect.@xcite indeed , the electrically induced magnetization ( me@xmath14 ) in cr@xmath0o@xmath1 was observed experimentally for the first time by astrov,@xcite and soon after , rado and folen@xcite measured the the converse effect , i.e the magnetic - field induced electric polarization ( me@xmath7 ) .    despite the scarcity of compounds with cross - coupled magnetic and electric properties , which is related to the antagonistic requirements for the existence of",
    "both orders,@xcite the research in the field has grown enormously .",
    "since the discovery of me effects in cr@xmath0o@xmath1 , more than 100 magnetoelectric compounds have been discovered or synthesized.@xcite the motivation behind this activity stems from the novel and fundamental physical phenomena involved , but also for exciting potential applications , including me sensors and the electric control of magnetic memories without electric currents ( and thus joule heating).@xcite    at the center of interest have been the so - called multiferroics , which are materials possessing at least two switchable order parameters , such as electric polarization @xmath2 , magnetization @xmath12 , and strain.@xcite multiferroics show spontaneous me effects in addition to those induced by external fields . despite the coexistence of ferroelectricity and magnetism , very few multiferroic materials exhibit strong coupling between @xmath2 and @xmath12,@xcite and in most cases the coupling is rather weak .",
    "typical examples are the perovskites bimno@xmath1 and bifeo@xmath1 , where the ferroelectric transition temperature is much higher than the magnetic one.@xcite    a breakthrough in the field came with the discovery of the multiferroics tbmno@xmath1@xcite and tbmn@xmath0o@xmath15,@xcite where the ferroelectricity is directly driven by the spin order .",
    "the magnetic state in these compounds is either a spiral ( as in tbmno@xmath1,@xcite ni@xmath1v@xmath0o@xmath16,@xcite and mnwo@xmath17@xcite ) , or a collinear configuration ( as in ca@xmath1(comn)@xmath0o@xmath18@xcite ) . for the understanding of the me effects in these systems",
    ", there has been a number of proposed microscopic mechanisms ( such as the spin - current model,@xcite the exchange - striction model,@xcite and the electric - current cancelation model@xcite ) , in addition to landau - ginzburg phenomenological theories.@xcite    here we focus on the cubic magnetoelectric insulator cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1.@xcite this system crystallizes in the non - centrosymmetric space group _ _ p__2@xmath193,@xcite which allows for piezoelectricity and piezomagnetism but not for a spontaneous polarization .",
    "the structure is a three - dimensional ( 3d ) array of distorted corner - sharing tetrahedra of copper spin @xmath20 ions .",
    "the unit cell consists of 16 copper ions which belong to two crystallographically inequivalent groups denoted here by cu@xmath21 and cu@xmath22 ( wyckoff positions 4@xmath23 and 12@xmath24 , respectively ) .",
    "each tetrahedron comprises three cu@xmath0 and one cu@xmath19 ion .",
    "polycrystalline samples of this compound were studied by bos _",
    "et al._,@xcite who reported a transition to a ferrimagnetic state at t@xmath25 k. based on neutron powder diffraction data , bos _ et al._@xcite proposed that in this state all cu@xmath0 moments prefer to align parallel to each other and anti - parallel to the cu@xmath19 moments",
    ". when all cu spins have their full moment , this 3up-1down state corresponds to a 1/2 magnetization plateau , which is realized for h@xmath261 koe.@xcite the 3up-1down nature of this plateau was later confirmed by high field ( 14 t ) @xmath27se nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr).@xcite    the presence of a finite me coupling in cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 is revealed by an anomaly in the dielectric constant,@xcite at the onset of the magnetically ordered state . at the same time , high resolution synchrotron x - ray powder diffraction data@xcite show that the system remains metrically cubic down to 10 k , with no anomalous change in the lattice constant through the magnetic transition .",
    "this is also supported by infrared@xcite and raman@xcite studies in single crystals .",
    "furthermore , the nmr study by belesi _",
    "et al._@xcite demonstrates that there is not any measurable structural distortion even in high magnetic fields.@xcite these findings strongly suggest that the dielectric constant anomaly is not related to any magnetostructural coupling or polar structural distortions,@xcite but is rather driven by the ( primary ) magnetic order parameter .",
    "the magnetism of cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 below the 1/2 magnetization plateau is very special . on the theoretical side",
    ", the reason can be understood from its non - centrosymmetric crystal structure that belongs to laue class t ( 23 ) . in cubic magnets from this class ,",
    "the magnetic ( free ) energy contains lifshitz - type invariants , which impair the homogeneity of the magnetic ordering and cause a continuous , helical twisting of the magnetic order parameter with a fixed sense of rotation , as first predicted by dzyaloshinskii.@xcite microscopically , the origin of these couplings relies on the weak ( relativistic ) dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) antisymmetric exchange that leads to a slight twisting of neighboring magnetic moments.@xcite    the best known cubic chiral helimagnets are the intermetallic compounds and alloys with the `` b20 '' structure , which belong also to the laue class t.@xcite in magnetic systems with this crystallographic structure , like mnsi,@xcite ( fe , co)si,@xcite , or fege,@xcite long - period transverse flat ferromagnetic helices are observed to form the magnetic ground state .",
    "currently , there is a surge of interest in these systems because complex topological spin textures composed of topologicical solitons called `` chiral skyrmions '' have been predicted to exist in these systems under certain additional conditions,@xcite and have been observed in thin films.@xcite furthermore , near the magnetic ordering transitions , a complex sequence of unusual magnetic textures and properties have been observed,@xcite which are usually referred to as the `` a - phase '' .    very recently , it has been found that the magnetically ordered ground - state of cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 is in fact a long - period helix with a pitch of about 50  nm.@xcite the magnetism has also been described as very similar to that of the b20 chiral ferromagnets , and the observation of field - driven skyrmion textures stabilized in thin film single crystals has been reported by lorentz - microscopy.@xcite    theoretically , the chiral long - period modulation is the expected behavior of a magnetic system with a simple vector order parameter that belongs to one of the crystallographic classes that allow for the existence of lifshitz - invariants .",
    "the basic spin - structure is dictated by the isotropic exchange , and can be well described by a collinear ferrimagnetic order with very large exchange fields of the order of 50 - 100  t.@xcite in fact , detailed microscopic calculations based on density - functional theory@xcite show that no magnetic frustration should be present in cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 , although the magnetic multi - sublattice structure appears to allow for geometric frustration .",
    "the weak relativistic dm interactions are a secondary effect that causes a long - period twisting of this primary ferrimagnetic order .",
    "this is in agreement with the symmetry analysis by gnezdilov _",
    "et al._,@xcite who argued that dm interactions must be important to understand the magnetism in cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the magnetoelectric insulator cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 should be understood as a chiral ferrimagnetic helimagnet , and its magnetization process in a field is that of the field - driven evolution of a chiral helix .    here",
    "we report an extensive magnetoelectric study on single crystals of cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 .",
    "our data demonstrate the me@xmath7 effect , as well as a finite magnetocapacitance ( mc ) which sets in at the onset of the magnetically ordered state ( @xmath3 k ) .",
    "we probe these effects in considerable detail as a function of temperature ( t ) and applied field @xmath4 .",
    "we also study the variation of @xmath2 and mc with respect to the relative orientations of @xmath4 with the crystallographic axes , as well as the relative orientation between magnetic and ac - electric @xmath13 fields ( for the mc measurements ) .",
    "our me data manifest a number of anomalies which signal magnetic phase transitions . from these anomalies",
    "we map out the magnetic phase diagram of the system in the h@xmath28-t plane , and demonstrate that there are at least two additional magnetic phases below the 1/2-plateau , the low - field and the intermediate - field phase .",
    "we show that in the intermediate phase the field dependence of the me@xmath7 data is fully consistent with the evolution of a chiral conical helix , whose propagation vector is along @xmath4 . in the low - field phase , the vanishing of the me response as h @xmath29 0 suggests a multi - domain structure of flat transverse helices , where the propagation vectors of the different helices are pinned along some preferred axes of the system .",
    "the transition between the low - field and the intermediate - field phase can then be ascribed to the complete alignment of these propagation vectors along @xmath4 .",
    "the above picture of two additional phases at low fields seems to be consistent up to t@xmath30 30 k. at higher temperatures , further anomalies are observed which suggest in particular a complex thermal reorientation of the anisotropy .",
    "we also find a very characteristic double - peak anomaly in the me@xmath7 effect in a very narrow ( 2k ) window close to @xmath31 , which might well be related to the possible presence of the `` a - phase '' mentioned above , which is typically expected close to @xmath31.@xcite    on the theory side , we present a landau - ginzburg phenomenological theory which captures both qualitatively and quantitative features of the me@xmath7 effect , in the intermediate and the 1/2-plateau phase .",
    "in particular , this theory explains the angular dependence of the me@xmath7 effect , as well as the robust sign change of the polarization p as we go from the intermediate to the 1/2-plateau phase .",
    "in addition , it provides strong evidence that the me effect in this compound can be attributed to an exchange striction mechanism which involves the symmetric portion of the anisotropic exchange .",
    "contrary to expectations , the influence of the dm coupling in the me effect is heavily diminished by the long - wavelength nature of the helimagnetism in cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 .",
    "the theory also predicts that apart from the uniform component of the electric polarization ( which is what we measure in the present experiments ) , there is also a spatially oscillating component ( on a mesoscopic scale ) that is naturally driven by the long - period helimagnetism in cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 .",
    "finally , a similar landau - ginzburg theory is also given for the mc measurements .",

    "these helices have their propagation directions along the easy axes of the cubic system , i.e. the magnetic moments are rotating in the plane normal to such an axis . since the single - ion magnetic anisotropy is absent for in the present s=1/2 compound , the leading anisotropy in this cubic system should be of the exchange type . depending on the sign of this anisotropic exchange ,",
    "the easy axes are along [ 111 ] or [ 100].@xcite the ground - state may form a thermodynamical multidomain state , composed of these helices , owing to magnetoelastic effects , similar to stable domain states in ordinary antiferromagnets .",
    "first - order magnetization processes transform this multidomain state into a single - domain of a conical helix that propagates in the direction of the applied field and displays a net magnetization.@xcite the details of this process depend on the orientation of the field with respect to the easy axes and can be hysteretic . as will be shown below by considering the possible me coupling terms in the phenomenological theory , for a cubic magnetoeletric helimagnet like cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 ,",
    "the conical helices display a net dielectric polarization , while the effect from the flat helices averages out .",
    "therefore , the magnetically driven reorientation process may proceed via an intermediate domain state that is composed of flat helices without a net dielectric polarization and the polarized field - driven conical helix . in that case",

    "contrary to expectations , the influence of the dm coupling in the me effect is heavily diminished due to the long - wavelength nature of the twist . instead , the me effect is driven by an exchange striction mechanism involving the symmetric portion of the exchange anisotropy , with three central features : ( i ) the uniform component of @xmath2 points along the vector @xmath8 ; ( ii ) its strength is proportional to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the longitudinal and @xmath11 is the transverse ( and spiraling ) component of the magnetic ordering .",
    "hence , the field dependence of p provides a clear signature of the evolution of a conical helix under a magnetic field ; and ( iii ) apart from its uniform component , the polarization @xmath2 has also a long - wavelength spatial component that is given by the pitch of the magnetic helices .",

    "<S> we present magnetodielectric measurements in single crystals of the cubic spin-1/2 compound cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 . a magnetic field - induced electric polarization </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath2 ) and a finite magnetocapacitance ( mc ) is observed at the onset of the magnetically ordered state ( @xmath3 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath2 and mc are explored in considerable detail as a function of temperature ( t ) , applied field @xmath4 , and relative field orientations with respect to the crystallographic axes . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetodielectric data show a number of anomalies which signal magnetic phase transitions , and allow to map out the phase diagram of the system in the @xmath5-t plane . below the 3up-1down collinear ferrimagnetic phase , we find two additional magnetic phases . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that these are related to the field - driven evolution of a long - period helical phase , which is stabilized by the chiral dzyalozinskii - moriya term @xmath6 that is present in this non - centrosymmetric compound . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a phenomenological landau - ginzburg theory for the me@xmath7 effect , which is in excellent agreement with experimental data , and shows three novel features : ( i ) the polarization @xmath2 has a uniform as well as a long - wavelength spatial component that is given by the pitch of the magnetic helices , ( ii ) the uniform component of @xmath2 points along the vector @xmath8 , and ( iii ) its strength is proportional to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the longitudinal and @xmath11 is the transverse ( and spiraling ) component of the magnetic ordering . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the field dependence of p provides a clear signature of the evolution of a conical helix under a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> a similar phenomenological theory is discussed for the mc . </S>"
