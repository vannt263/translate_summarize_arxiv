    "the acceleration of the rate of expansion of the universe , first discovered through the dimming of distant type ia supernovae @xcite , is being confirmed by various new cosmological tests .",
    "the cosmic microwave background measurements by the wilkinson microwave anisotropic probe ( wmap ) @xcite and the results from the large scale distribution of galaxies @xcite and galaxy clusters @xcite confirm that our universe is dominated by a fluid of negative pressure .",
    "the understanding of the accelerated expansion of the cosmos might result in a change of our description of gravity or in the identification of unknown components of the cosmos . since this is of utmost importance to fundamental physics , large sets of cosmological data and various procedures to analyze them are being examined .",
    "the correct identification of what composes the fluid of negative pressure or `` dark energy '' is one of the most challenging issues at the interface between particle physics and modern cosmology .",
    "detecting the acceleration with a probe that interacts differently from photons can provide a new insight into this puzzling issue .",
    "the only particles at our disposal that can be used for such a task are the diffuse supernova ( sn ) neutrinos emitted from core collapse ( cc ) sne .",
    "as discussed in more detail below , most of the massive stars in our universe ( with mass above about 5 - 8 solar masses ) end their lives with a violent collapse . during this collapse",
    "the massive stars release a huge flux of neutrinos .",
    "thus a continuous and isotropic flux of neutrinos from very far cc sne is expected to be present .",
    "it is commonly denoted as the diffuse sn neutrino flux or supernova relic neutrino ( srn ) flux .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the possibility that information on the parameters governing the accelerated expansion may be extracted by using measurements that do not solely rely on detection of luminous objects and the knowledge of their intensity .",
    "we propose that the observation of the srn , when combined with improved measurements of the past supernova explosion rate , may provide an independent source of information on the cosmological evolution parameters .",
    "future megaton ( mt ) water - cherenkov detectors ( such as uno  @xcite , hyper - kamiokande  @xcite or memphys  @xcite ) , if enriched by gadolinium - rich material ( see the gadzooks !",
    "proposal  @xcite ) , are capable of observing hundreds of supernova relic neutrinos ( srns ) per year .",
    "in addition we expect a significant improvement in the amount of data that will be available from the direct detection of cc sn explosions with future sn surveys like destiny  @xcite , dune  @xcite , jedi  @xcite , lsst  @xcite or snap  @xcite .",
    "this will yield a direct measurement of the sn cc rate as a function of redshift , @xmath0 , as opposed to an indirect estimate based on the cosmic star formation history ( sfh ) , which is subject to sizable uncertainties , if a flux - based sfh measurement is used here , the sensitivity to the cosmological parameters is lost . ] .",
    "our basic idea can be described as replacing the photons from type ia sne , standard(izable ) light candles , with neutrinos emitted from cc sne .",
    "the latter may roughly be viewed as  standard neutrino candles \" . unlike the case of photons from type ia sn , the detection of srns can not be correlated with individual cc events . only the integrated energy spectrum of neutrinos emitted from sne at various distances and directions will be available .",
    "thus , this signal by itself can not be used in order to extract information on cosmology since it measures an `` averaged '' flux of sn neutrinos coming from sources at various distances . however",
    ", when combined with a future measurement of the cc sne explosion rate , the neutrino signal does carry valuable cosmological information .",
    "let us schematically describe the basic elements of our method :    * future neutrino experiments will provide us with rather accurate information on the srn differential flux @xmath1 .",
    "* future direct observation of supernovae at different redshifts will provide us with an estimate for the cc supernova rate , @xmath2 . *",
    "the above observables both depend on the comoving cc supernova rate @xmath0 , but with a different dependence on cosmology .",
    "thus we can combine the above measurements to extract data on the cosmological evolution parameters . * the dependence on the star formation rate , known only to a rough accuracy , cancels when combining the two measurements .",
    "this large source of uncertainty drops out of our extraction of cosmological evolution parameters .    without understanding the related systematic uncertainties , however , extraction of useful information from such measurements is impossible . at this stage , with the present theoretical and experimental knowledge , it is not completely clear whether the above is a realistic task .",
    "below we present several aspects of our study in more details , in particular we describe how our proposal could work in practice for an optimal case study .",
    "next we discuss the various uncertainties involved , pointing out several directions that may help in decreasing them . to show how our proposal works , as a matter of principle",

    "demonstrate it in a simplified scenario .",
    "in section  [ snrate ] we focus on the core collapse sn rate .",
    "we discuss how it is measured at present and how the future sn observatories have the potential to reduce the related uncertainties , leading in the context of our proposal to a more sensitive cosmological probe .",
    "we also describe how we estimate the detection efficiency of a snap - like experiment in order to give a quantitative answer to the possibility of discrimination between ( i ) and ( ii ) . in section  [ neutrinos ]",
    "we discuss the future neutrino detectors ( mt cherenkov detectors enriched by gdcl@xmath10 and also , briefly , 100 kiloton ( kt ) liquid argon or scintillator detectors ) and discuss their ability to observe the sne diffuse neutrino flux .",
    "we also consider the uncertainties related to the flux and the spectra of neutrinos emitted from cc sne .",
    "we discuss the possibility of reducing some of the related unknowns with future observations of nearby sn explosions .",
    "we also present our final results , consisting of projections for future measurements which combine all of the above analyses . in section  [ summary ]",
    "we summarize our results and discuss the importance of our method for confirming and cross - checking our understanding of the cosmological expansion parameters .",
    "all of the known methods for probing cosmological parameters rely on the existence of standard rulers , related to a well understood physical quantity at some time in the history of our universe .",
    "this quantity is measured at later time and the way the quantity evolved with time gives a sensitive cosmological probe .",
    "one well known example is the angular size of the first peak in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) for which the standard ruler is the horizon size during the time of last scattering .",
    "the measurement of the location of the first peak allowed us to deduce that we live in a flat universe ( see _ e.g _ @xcite ) .",
    "other measurements related to large scale structure such as galaxy power spectrum mentioned above , yield a precise determination of the amount of dark matter .",
    "this is done via comparison of the size and the amplitude of the sub - horizon perturbations at the time of last scattering and today .",
    "the direct measurement of the dark energy / cosmological constant comes from luminosity distant measurements . in that case",
    "it is knowledge of the intrinsic luminosity of the type ia sne which plays the role of the standard ruler .",
    "the observed sn luminosity is being directly translated to a measurement of its distance as a function of redshift , which is very sensitive to the rate of the cosmological expansion .",
    "our method is similar to the one just described with some variations .",
    "the standard ruler comes from a combination of the `` known '' neutrino flux from cc sne and the future measurement of the sn explosion rate .    in order to see how our method works in practice , we assume that future neutrino detectors will provide a measurement of the srn differential flux vs. energy , @xmath11 .",
    "in addition sn observatories will provide the core - collapse sn explosion rate per unit redshift , @xmath12 .",
    "schematically the srn flux is given by ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath13 where , since a typical experiment has a threshold of roughly 10@xmath14mev , the dependence of the observed differential flux on @xmath15 for @xmath16 is very weak .",
    "the dependence on cosmological evolution parameters is via the volume factor @xmath17 and the flux factor @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the luminosity distance and @xmath20 , where @xmath21^{-1}\\:\\label{dtdz}\\ ] ] with @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the emitted neutrino spectra which can be approximated by a `` pinched '' fermi - dirac distribution ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "( [ dtdz ] ) and below we assume for simplicity a flat universe , @xmath26 .",
    "let us for simplicity assume at this level of discussion that the neutrino spectral parameters are well known .",
    "this is an idealized approximation , however it is not inconceivable that substantial progress may come from future experimental inputs and/or from future improvements in sn theory and simulations",
    ". furthermore , for concreteness we set the parameters of the sn explosion rate to their mean values . in this way",
    "the only unknown parameter is the dark energy parameter @xmath27 .",
    "we can use the observed rate , @xmath2 , to predict the neutrino flux via eq .",
    "( [ flux0 ] ) , by substituting the relation for the observed sn rate ( [ rsncou ] ) in the expression for the predicted flux ( [ flux0 ] ) : @xmath28 it is evident from ( [ flux1 ] ) that the inferred flux strongly depends on the luminosity distance and is therefore sensitive to the cosmological parameters .",
    "hence , by comparing prediction with observation , we can determine which cosmological model provides a better fit to the data .",
    "we first consider the case in which our universe is @xmath29cdm ( with @xmath30 ) .",
    "[ nulscdm](a ) we plot the observed neutrino flux ( via future neutrino observatories ) in green . in red ( blue )",

    "[ nulscdm](b ) we repeat the same procedure , but in the opposite case in which the universe is scdm , and hence @xmath17 is calculated accordingly . in both cases",
    "one can see that the curve of the predicted flux based on the correct cosmology tracks the observed one while the predicted flux based on the wrong cosmology deviates by a significant amount from the observations . in practice",
    "we expect the curves of the predicted flux will be replaced by histogram bins based on the observation of @xmath33(5000 ) cc sne and the observed flux will be based on the observation of @xmath33(1000 ) electron anti - neutrino events . up to now",

    "before considering the details of the direct observation of core collapse rate , we first compare the present and future methods of sn - rate determination and explain why we need a sn survey .",
    "our proposal relies on the fact that the cosmological parameters enters differently in the measurements of the supernova density and the differential neutrino flux . in this way",
    "the dependence on the largely unknown shape of the sn comoving rate cancels in the predicted neutrino flux . at the same time the latter remains rather sensitive to the cosmological parameters .",
    "the validity of the above statement depends on the experimental method by which @xmath0 is extracted . in the following we discuss the present and future methods for extraction of @xmath0 .",
    "we shall argue that future , more direct , measurements are what is required to make our proposal a possibility .",
    "the conventional observation of the sn rate relies on measurements of light emitted from galaxies , mostly in the uv ( see _ e.g _ @xcite for a recent compilation of the data ) .",
    "even though a lot of effort is dedicated to improve the precision of these measurement , @xmath34 still suffers from rather large uncertainties .",
    "furthermore the above measurements are not very useful for our proposal since the sensitivity to the cosmological parameters is lost when they are used in combination with the srn flux  @xcite . in the case of ( uv ) light measurements ,",
    "the comoving rate would be proportional to the observed flux , @xmath35 , according to the relation @xmath36 one clearly see that @xmath34 and the factors carrying the cosmological information enter exactly in the same combination as in eq .",
    "( [ flux0 ] ) .",
    "thus the predicted srn differential rate , in terms of the sn core collapse rate , is given by @xmath37 which is , to leading order , cosmology independent .",
    "methods which rely on comparison between light flux measurements and neutrino flux measurements are not useful , since the resulting dependence on cosmology is very weak .",
    "forthcoming sn observatories will have the power to record an @xmath38 cc sne per year ( see also  @xcite ) and will yield a significant improvement in the measurement of @xmath0  @xcite . in this case",
    "the extracted comoving sn rate is inferred by using eq .",
    "( [ rsn ] ) .",
    "one can repeat the above manipulations but in this case the cosmology does not cancel in the expression for the predicted srn differential flux .",
    "this can be easily understood since the counting of explosions is a measurement of density . when combined with a measurement of a flux",
    "the resulting expression is still cosmology dependent , as shown explicitly in  ( [ flux1 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the mere comparison of the sn rate indirectly inferred from measurements of sfh with the direct one contains some cosmological information , even without the need of measuring the flux of the srn .",
    "the problem with such an analysis is two - fold .",
    "first of all , the determination of sfh is not very precise and it is subject to large uncertainties .",
    "for instance the measurements of uv light are subject to large dust absorption factors ( so that large corrections must be applied in order that the uv and ir data agree  @xcite ) .",
    "thus the resulting uncertainties are large .",
    "secondly , one needs to assume that the sn explosion rate is directly proportional to the sfh [ see @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ rsn ] ) ] and the redshift dependence of the proportionality constant has to be modeled ( a constant is chosen as a first approximation ) .",
    "it is hard to see how this assumption will be independently tested and the proportionality coefficient accurately measured in the near future .",
    "the situation is different when using the neutrino signal .",
    "moreover , unlike in the case of the star formation rate , the physical mechanism of neutrino emission from cc sne is in principle better understood .",
    "clearly in terms of light spectra and emission the cc sne are much richer and show strong dependence on the progenitor type ( not to mention the open questions regarding the explosion mechanism ) .",
    "however , one should bear in mind that the photons carry away only 1% of the emitted energy while 99% of the energy is released in neutrinos .",
    "thus the above uncertainties affect neutrino emission in a less dramatic way .",
    "simulations and theoretical arguments seem to imply that , in terms of the neutrino flux , the cc sne are much more universal than in terms of the emitted light  @xcite .",
    "this is naturally expected since neutrino emission mostly depends on the physics of the collapsing iron core reaching the chandrasekhar mass , deep inside a huge star . very crudely",
    "the above picture was already confirmed by the observation of the 1987a sn neutrinos .",
    "clearly , the details of the observed spectra shows some puzzling features  @xcite which call for more data .",
    "we expect that in the future substantial theoretical and experimental progress will be made and the mass hierarchy .",
    "] to further improve the understanding of the emitted neutrino spectra .",
    "we shall now discuss in more detail the future observation of the core collapse supernova rate .",
    "our main aim is to extract the significance of our proposal . to do this",
    ", we need to estimate the core - collapse sn rate per red shift bin that a snap - like survey will observe .",
    "furthermore , in order to correctly assign the statistical uncertainties and estimate the systematics , we should have a reasonable idea regarding the detection efficiency and the sn light extinction .",
    "we would like also to check that our method , in a realistic case , remain fairly insensitive to the specific form of @xmath34 , as it was in the previous idealized case .",
    "the above issues are addressed in two steps as follows :    * we assumed two different comoving core collapse rates @xmath0 and for each one the expected explosions per red shift bin , @xmath2 , was computed in both the @xmath29cdm and scdm cosmologies .",
    "* we extracted the detection efficiencies and the dust extinction effects by using the snoc monte - carlo simulation package for high-@xmath40 supernova observations  @xcite .",
    "we applied a detection strategy and optical sensitivity as given in the snap specification .",
    "since the total acceptance depends on cosmology , this was done for the two underlying cosmologies .",
    "moreover we simulated samples of sne using different dust properties in order to estimate ( part of ) the systematic uncertainties .    with the above information at hand",
    ", we combined the two pieces of uncertainties into an overall uncertainty on the sn counts per redshift bin .",
    "this would later be combined with the projection for the srn spectral measurements in order to estimate the significance of our method .",
    "we shall now describe each of the above items in more detail .",
    "we start with step ( ii ) which is related to the estimation of snap acceptance .",
    "we used filters spanning from b to near - infrared ( nir ) , h - band .",
    "we required the following specifications for a full detection ( and tagging ) of a core collapse sn : one point on the light curve , 4 rest - frame days before the peak - luminosity in at least one filter band , and 10 points on the light curve in all the bands .",
    "we derived the efficiencies for two scanning strategies , a 4-day and an 8-day one , with limiting detection magnitudes of 25 and 28 respectively ( the 8-day search is deeper ) .",
    "for simplicity we only focused on detection of type - ii sne which accounts for roughly 80% of the total number of core collapse sne .",
    "for each 0.1 red shift bin , we simulate 1000 explosions so that the statistical uncertainties in estimating the efficiency are of @xmath33(3% ) and will be neglected in the total error .    to estimate the systematic uncertainties we only focus on the dependence upon dust properties .",
    "we extracted the central value of the efficiency by using a `` high '' dust model with selective extinction @xmath41 , a typical value for starburst galaxies .",
    "indeed recent observations suggest that a sizable number of cc sne are dust extincted .",
    "however we also repeated the analysis with two other dust models with lower and higher dust content ( with @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively ) .",
    "the spread of the efficiencies computed in these different models should give an idea of the size of systematic uncertainties introduced by dust ( as in snoc , we do not take into account any @xmath40-dependent dust evolution ) .",
    "given the recent progress in understanding dust properties of high redshift galaxies we can assume that our knowledge on dust extinction will be significantly improved in the next 10 - 15 years , and used to estimate better the efficiency . thus in the following we will use as an estimate of the systematic uncertainties on the efficiency the spread of the above models reduced by a factor of @xmath44 .",
    "another reason for the need to estimate the efficiency is that it depends on the underlying cosmology . as a first approximation one can think about it as @xmath45 and it decreases for high redshifts . as we will show below , the dependence on the cosmology in the predicted srn flux will be @xmath46 $ ] ( see eq .",
    "( [ flux2 ] ) ) and we therefore verified that the efficiency does not significantly reduce the sensitivity to the cosmological parameters . in fig .",

    "we have demonstrated that the observation of supernova relic neutrinos ( srns ) , when combined with improved measurements of the past supernovae explosion rate , has the potential to probe the expansion history of the universe .",
    "the cosmology dependence in our proposal enters through a weighted integral over red shift of the luminosity distance squared ( weighted by the supernova rate and the neutrino spectra ) , and hence differs from luminosity distance measurements of type ia supernova observations .    the prospect of probing fundamental cosmological parameters using a different probe other that photons is very exciting .",
    "such measurements open the possibility of sensitivity to unknown new physics that distinguish photons from other kind of particles .",
    "one such example is the case of photon - axion mixing  @xcite ( or more generally , mixing of photon with any other light particle ) where some of the original photon flux is converted to a flux of invisible particles .",
    "while it is known that the current data regarding the acceleration can not be solely explained by such an effect  @xcite , it can still be significantly affected by it  @xcite .",
    "for instance , it can drive the equation of state parameter , @xmath27 , to rather low values , below @xmath74 , or to high values , above @xmath75 .",
    "it is known that the supernova data alone allows for very low values of @xmath27 ( even values below @xmath76 are allowed ) since it is highly degenerate in the @xmath77 plane ( even though , with a larger sample and a wider redshift range , the supernovae data by themselves will be able to break this degeneracy ; see _ e.g. _ the recent release of snls  @xcite ) . in the future",
    "it will be very interesting to compare the constraints on @xmath27 from sne with other experimental results , to look for systematic biases or non - standard physics , especially since other surveys have started to probe @xmath27 as well ; see _ e.g. _ @xcite for a recent discussion .",
    "it is noted in that context that our signal , which is driven by the neutrino flux , is subject to very different kinds of systematic biases and is affected by very different kinds of new physics effects .",
    "we remark that the numerical closeness of the neutrino mass and the dark energy scale has recently attracted a lot of interest in the possibility that these two are related  @xcite .",
    "if this is indeed the case , it could be that the universe `` seen '' with neutrinos is very different from the one probed via photons  @xcite . in that sense ,",
    "even though our method can not compete with the precision of optical methods , it is complementary to the ones already proposed  @xcite .",
    "in the case where the above analysis will not reveal deviations from the expected results ( based on optical observation ) one can apply a similar analysis in order to improve our knowledge regarding the neutrino spectra .",
    "setting the cosmological parameters to their values obtained from the future global fit and combined these with the observed diffuse neutrino flux will allow one to extract the values of the parameters determining the sn neutrino energy spectra .",
    "we finally comment that our method does not rely on the construction of a dedicated new experiment but rather on combining data from experiments that are likely to be built for other reasons .",
