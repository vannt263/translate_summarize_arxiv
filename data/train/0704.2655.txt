    "the emission from these two species arises from a similar range of velocities , which has been interpreted as evidence for a common physical origin ( @xcite ) , particularly because the lower level of the sio @xmath2 maser lies at a similar energy above the ground state ( 1792  k ) as does the 658  ghz line . a scatter plot of the line width ( fwzi ) of these two masers in all 16 objects",

    "sma observations at 230  ghz continuum with a @xmath9 beam find the emission to be unresolved ( @xcite ) . proceeding with the likely assumption that the 658  ghz continuum emission is likewise compact with respect to the synthesized beam ( @xmath10 ) , we generated a continuum dataset using all the correlator chunks in usb except the one containing the maser line .",
    "we used that dataset to calibrate the antenna phases and amplitudes with a point source model , and applied the solutions to the spectral line data .",
    "a plot of the resulting amplitude vs. uv distance is shown in fig .  [ uvdist ] . there is no discernible drop in amplitude with distance , suggesting that the source remains unresolved at these angular scales .",
    "further evidence for this conclusion comes from the uv spectrum ( fig .",

    "@xcite used vy  cma to calibrate observations of the ultracompact hii region g240.31 + 0.07 , located less than @xmath12 away .",
    "the measured phase of the water maser emission was used to calibrate the temporal changes in atmospheric phase plus instrumental phase time while the unresolved stellar continuum emission ( @xmath13  jy ) was used to calibrate the amplitudes .",
    "the 658  ghz maser line has also been used to test the effectiveness of phase transfer between the 200 and 600  ghz bands on the sma .",
    "using observations of the star w  hydra on 28 jan 2005 , the antenna - based phase solutions for the 215  ghz sio maser emission and the 658  ghz h@xmath1o maser emission were compared over a period of several hours and shown to change in a ratio close to that expected theoretically ( @xcite ) . at sma , the usage of this technique is limited due to some remaining instrumental thermal drifts and phase jumps currently under investigation ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the phase transfer technique is expected to be relied upon heavily by alma ( @xcite ) , typically from band 3 ( 84 - 116  ghz ) where bright quasars are more numerous , to higher frequency bands where they are not ( @xcite ) .",
    "at the present time , the sma has the potential to observe the 658  ghz maser sources with a beamsize as small as @xmath14 , where it may begin to resolve the emission as a phase gradient in velocity .",
    "for example , 43  ghz vlbi observations of tx  cam show a ring of sio masers with a diameter of @xmath15 ( @xcite ) . after its launch in 2008 , the band 2 receiver ( @xcite ) of the heterodyne instrument for",

    "<S> discovered in 1995 at the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) , the vibrationally - excited water maser line at 658 ghz ( 455 micron ) is seen in oxygen - rich giant and supergiant stars . because this maser can be so strong ( up to thousands of janskys ) , it was very helpful during the commissioning phase of the highest frequency band ( 620 - 700 ghz ) of the submillimeter array ( sma ) interferometer . from late 2002 to early 2006 , brief attempts were made to search for emission from additional sources beyond the original cso survey . </S>",
    "<S> these efforts have expanded the source count from 10 to 16 . </S>",
    "<S> the maser emission appears to be quite compact spatially , as expected from theoretical considerations ; thus these objects can potentially be used as atmospheric phase calibrators . </S>",
    "<S> many of these objects also exhibit maser emission in the vibrationally - excited sio maser at 215 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> because both maser lines likely originate from a similar physical region , these objects can be used to test techniques of phase transfer calibration between millimeter and submillimeter bands . </S>",
    "<S> the 658 ghz masers will be important beacons to assess the performance of the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) in this challenging high - frequency band . </S>"
