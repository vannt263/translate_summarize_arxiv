    "the quest for a quantum theory of gravity produced a variety of approaches that include string theory , loop quantum gravity , spin foams , causal sets , and causal dynamical triangulations .",
    "the successful theory should provide a coherent structure that accommodates both classical relativity and quantum mechanics , show that the familiar physical phenomena on the flat spacetime background emerge in some appropriate limit and finally make predictions on the kind and magnitude of the departures from this picture .",
    "this final goal has not yet been achieved by any of the approaches , but each of these attempts has brought many insights and led to a better understanding of the problem s complexity .",
    "quantum causal histories ( qchs ) approach @xcite to the quantization of gravity is a background - independent formalism that satisfies many of the conditions that are argued for by the above models .",
    "the idea is to use a causal set to describe the casual structure while a quantum theory being introduced through the assignment of finite - dimensional hilbert spaces to the elementary events .",
    "originally motivated by quantum cosmology @xcite , and providing a description of the causal spin foam models @xcite , qchs make a direct contact with quantum computation and quantum information theory @xcite in general .",

    "next , we show that the only causal histories that are compatible with quantum mechanics are those that can be represented as quantum computational networks",

    ". an acausal set is a subset @xmath11 such that all events in it are spacelike separated from one another .",

    "even when the state of the loop is not determined uniquely , every imposition of the consistency condition reduces the dimensionality of the set of consistent states @xmath50 at least by 1 .",
    "hence , if we are ready to accept the lower dimensional set of the possible evolutions , a ctc can not have more that @xmath59 links with the chronology - respecting part of the graph , while if one insists on generic @xmath22 , there could be only a single link .",
    "we conclude the following . within the strict interpretation of the acausal surfaces , ctcs either prevent the introduction of quantum theory altogether , or lead to no ( observable ) changes by contributing an extra subspace to the ordinary chronology - respecting system . under the relaxed rules  la deutsch @xcite ,",
    "the demand of linearity of the dynamics leads to a decoupling of a chronology - respecting region and ctcs .",
    "if a non - linearity is accepted , then the ctc region does not carry independent degrees of freedom and only a certain amount of causal relations between the regions may be allowed .",

    "when one inquiries about possible reduced dynamics on it , that means following the evolution for all possible initial states on @xmath124 , while keeping the reduced state of the remaining subsystem @xmath125 and the correlations between the subsystems fixed",
    ". then the evolution of a @xmath126-dimensional state @xmath51 will be given by a linear , possibly non - cp , map .",
    "in particular @xcite , under the action of a unitary @xmath22 on an extended system , the reduced dynamics of @xmath51 is given by an affine map , with its linear part being a cp map and the traceless part related to the initial correlations between the system @xmath127 and the ancilla @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "more precisely , ( _ a)=_km_k_a m^_k+_ijlc_l , ij_ij_l , where the first expression on the rhs is a completely positive map @xmath129 that is written in kraus decomposition form , the coefficients @xmath130 depend on @xmath22 alone , and _ ij=(_ij-_i_j)/d_ad_b , [ corrtens ] is the correlation tensor @xcite , and the matrices @xmath131 are the generators of su@xmath132",
    ".    any cp map @xmath122 can be decomposed into a unital cp map @xmath133 and the constant term @xmath134",
    ". then if @xmath135 , the constant parts of the map cancel , and one is left with ( _ a)=_0 ( ) , i.e. , with a completely positive evolution .",
    "it should be noted that the requirement of unital evolution of the reduced subsystem imposes a simultaneous constraint on both allowed global unitaries @xmath22 and the initial states .",
    "choosing an acausal set is analogous to fixing a leaf in the foliation in the continuum case .",
    "on such a slice it is meaningful to define reduced density matrices , as in the previous section .",
    "however , an inverse procedure ( reconstructing @xmath136 from @xmath137 and @xmath138 is not unique . as it is seen from eq .",
    "( [ fano ] ) , an additional information on correlations is required .",
    "for example , in the two - qubit case a generic density matrix is specified by 15 real parameters , while the reduced density matrices specify only six of them . even for a pure state @xmath136",
    "there is more information in @xmath139 than just the degree of entanglement .",
    "all the maximally entangled states have @xmath140 , but are distinguished by different elements of @xmath139 .",
    "dynamics can help in reducing redundancy of the possible state reconstruction .",
    "in addition , change of lorentz frame that induces the change of ( semi - global ) foliations , is analogous to the choice of a different partition into acausal sets .",
    "if we consider an evolution of @xmath141 that is a subset of the acausal set @xmath15 into @xmath142 of the acausal set @xmath16 , which may be also taken as the subsets of the acausal sets @xmath143 and @xmath144 respectively , the reduced dynamics @xmath145 should be the same . given the reduced density matrices knowledge of the local evolution constrains their the possible embedding into the global states on @xmath23 and @xmath24 . to summarize the situation , the lorentzian structure of the space - time is defined through the definition of spacelike foliations of the causal history and how the quantum states living on these foliations are related by lorentz boosts .",
    "the quantum states associated to each spacelike hypersurface are not uniquely determined by the local information , i.e. , the reduced density matrices , but we need the global information contained in the correlations between these density matrices .",
    "these correlations are a priori induced by the precise dynamics ( unitarity operators ) on the causal set . at the end of the day ,",
    "more work is needed in order to be able to define precisely how the dynamics determines the action of lorentz transformations of quantum states on the causal set .",
    "this is left for future investigation .    to conclude ,",
    "we have discussed the quantum causal histories as introduced in @xcite .",
    "these are basically causal sets dressed with hilbert spaces ( on the nodes ) and ( completely positive ) operators on the arrows describing the evolution of the quantum states along the causal set . to start with ,",
    "we have addressed the issue of closed timelike loops and shown that they carry no relevant extra degrees of freedom .",
    "then we have noticed that the causal links of generic quantum causal histories are observer - dependent : they depend on the basis of measurements chosen by the observer .",
    "to get rid of this observer dependence , we must add causal links reflecting the way the dynamics entangle the various systems .",
    "moreover , restrictions on the measurement bases also restrict the allowed unitary evolutions . at this level",
    ", it appears more natural to switch to a dual picture where causal histories are described in terms of quantum computational networks ( quantum circuits ) : at the end of the day , these are the only causal histories that allow the introduction of quantum mechanics without imposing restrictions on the measurements .",
    "we have also discussed the requirement of complete positivity of the evolution operators .",
    "this is quite a restrictive requirement .",
    "however , it results from a standard posing of the initial - value problem and the assumption that the maximally mixed state remains such in the course of evolution . finally , we discussed the action of lorentz boosts on such quantum causal histories and explained that it involves understanding how the global quantum states can be deduced from the states ( reduced density matrices ) of the subsystems .",
    "this is a hard problem which involves understanding how the causal set dynamics creates correlations between the subsystems and which we leave as an open issue ."
