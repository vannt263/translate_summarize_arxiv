    "the amanda - ii neutrino detector located at south pole was constructed to search for astrophysical neutrinos .",
    "these neutrinos could originate from many different galactic and extragalactic candidate source types such as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , supernova remnants and microquasars .",
    "the detection of neutrinos is based on the observation of cherenkov light emitted by secondary muons produced in charged current neutrino interactions .",
    "this light is observed by photomultipliers deployed in the antarctic ice .",
    "their signals are used to reconstruct the direction and the energy of the primary neutrino .",
    "amanda - ii took data between 2000 and 2006 .",
    "the background of atmospheric muons is reduced by selecting only upward - going tracks in the detector , as only neutrinos are able to enter the detector from below .",
    "this restricts the field of view to the northern hemisphere .",
    "the data is filtered and processed to reject misreconstructed downward - going muon tracks @xcite .",
    "the final data sample contains 6144 neutrino induced events between a declination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with a purity of @xmath2 away from the horizon .",
    "the idea of this analysis is to search for deviations of the measured amanda - ii neutrino sky map from the expected event distribution for atmospheric neutrinos , which constitute the main part of the data sample @xcite .",
    "a method to study such anisotropies is a multipole analysis , which was also used to quantify the cosmic microwave background fluctuations .",
    "the analysis is based on the decomposition of an event distribution @xmath3 into spherical harmonics @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the zenith and azimuth of the spherical analysis coordinate system .",
    "the expansion coefficients are @xmath7 they provide information about the angular structure of the event distribution @xmath8 .",
    "the index @xmath9 corresponds to the scale of the angular structure @xmath10 while @xmath11 gives the orientation on the sphere .",
    "the expansion coefficients with @xmath12 depend only on the structure in the zenith direction of the analysis coordinate system .",
    "averaging over the orientation dependent @xmath13 yields the multipole moments @xmath14 they form an angular power spectrum characteristic for different input neutrino event distributions .",
    "the initial point of this analysis is the angular power spectrum of only atmospheric neutrino events .",
    "therefore , neutrino sky maps containing 6144 atmospheric neutrino events according to the bartol atmospheric neutrino flux model @xcite are simulated and numerically decomposed with the software package glesp @xcite .",
    "statistical fluctuations are considered by averaging over 1000 random sky maps , resulting in a mean @xmath15 and a statistical spread @xmath16 of each multipole moment .",
    "the same procedure is applied to simulated sky maps containing atmospheric and different amounts of signal neutrinos with a total event number of likewise 6144 events .",
    "the influence of the signal neutrinos on the angular power spectrum is studied in terms of the pulls @xmath17",
    "the different models for candidate neutrino sources investigated in this analysis are :    1 .   isotropically distributed point sources 2 .   a diffuse flux from fr - ii galaxies and blazars @xcite 3 .",
    "agn registered in the vron - cetty and vron ( vcv ) catalog @xcite 4 .",
    "galactic point sources such as supernova remnants or microquasars 5 .   cosmic rays interacting in the galactic plane .",
    "all simulated pointlike neutrino sources are characterized by a poissonian distributed source strength with mean @xmath18 and an energy spectrum @xmath19 . the relative angular detector acceptance depends on the neutrino energy and therefore on the spectral index of the simulated neutrino source .",
    "signal neutrinos are simulated according to this acceptance considering systematic fluctuations .",
    "the total number of signal neutrinos in a sky map of the northern hemisphere with @xmath20 simulated sources on the full - sky is therefore given by @xmath21 . additionally the angular resolution is taken into account .",
    "it dominates over the uncertainty between the neutrino and muon direction .",
    "the spectral index of pointlike sources is varied between @xmath22 . as the spectral index of atmospheric neutrinos is close to @xmath23 ,",
    "signal and backround neutrinos underlie different angular detector acceptances .",
    "thus , additionally to the clustering of events around the source directions also the shape of the total angular event distribution is used to identify a signature of signal neutrinos in the angular power spectrum @xcite .",
    "neutrinos from our galaxy disturb the atmospheric event distribution by their bunching within the galactic plane modeled by a gaussian band along the galactic equator .",
    "neutrinos produced in cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium of our galaxy are assumed to follow the @xmath24 primary energy spectrum .    a further topic ( model 6 ) that can be studied with a multipole analysis",
    "are neutrino oscillations .",
    "the survival probability of atmospheric muon neutrinos depends on the neutrino energy and the traveling length of the neutrino as well as the mixing angle @xmath25 and the squared mass difference @xmath26 .",
    "the traveling length can be expressed by the earth s radius and the zenith angle of the neutrino direction @xcite .",
    "thus , the neutrino oscillations disturb the angular event distribution of atmospheric neutrinos . with the assumption of @xmath27",
    "the squared mass difference remains for investigation . due to the relatively high energy threshold of @xmath28",
    "gev the effect is small .",
    "the deviations from a pure atmospheric angular power spectrum caused by signal neutrinos are studied by the pulls .",
    "these pulls are exemplarily shown in fig .",
    "[ sub_fig1 ] for the model of isotropic point sources .",
    "the behaviour of the pulls is characteristic for each signal model .",
    "different multipole moments carry different sensitivity to the neutrino signal . the absolute value of the pull increases linearly with the amount of signal neutrinos in the sky maps .",
    "each pull has a predefined sign .    the deviation of a particular sky map with multipole moments @xmath29 from the pure atmospheric expectation @xmath30 is quantified by a significance indicator @xmath31 defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 determines the considered multipole moments .",
    "the term in brackets is the pull between the particular sky map and the mean of the atmospheric expectation as defined in eq .",
    "[ pulls ] .",
    "the factors @xmath34 are defined to weight the pulls according to their expected sensitivity to the signal . for each neutrino signal model one dedicated set of weights @xmath35 is determined . due to the linear increase of the pulls with the signal strength the strength chosen to calculate @xmath36 is arbitrary .    the weight factors @xmath36 carry the expected sign of the pulls .",
    "sgn@xmath37 is the sign of the measured pull .",
    "thus , the @xmath31 calculated for the particular sky map is increased if the observed deviation has the direction expected for the signal model and reduced otherwise .",
    "due to the weighting of the pulls , the sensitivity becomes stable for high @xmath33 .",
    "a choice of @xmath38 is sufficient to provide best sensitivity to all investigated signal models .",
    "the @xmath31 of a sky map is interpreted physically by the use of confidence belts .",
    "therefore , 1000 sky maps for every signal strength within a certain range are simulated and the @xmath31-value for each sky map is calculated separately to obtain the @xmath31 distributions .",
    "the calculation of the average upper limit at 90% confidence level assuming zero - signal is used to estimate the sensitivity of the analysis to different astrophysical models apriori .",
    "as the multipole analysis is applied to a wide range of astrophysical topics , the trial factor of the analysis becomes important .",
    "the trial factor raises with each new set of weights used to evaluate the experimental data . for this reason",
    ", models with almost similar weights are combined to a common set of weights and only six sets are remaining .    if the signal signatures show up only in the zenith direction of the analysis coordinate system the expansion coefficients @xmath39 are more sensitive than the multipole moments @xmath29 .",
    "the reason is , that the expansion coefficients with @xmath40 are independent from the azimuth @xmath6 and contain the pure information about the zenith direction @xmath5 .",
    "a signal only depending on @xmath5 causes only statistical fluctuations but no physical information in the other expansion coefficients .",
    "therefore , the signal has only power in the @xmath41 .",
    "the analysis method stays exactly the same in these cases , except that all @xmath29 are replaced by the @xmath41 .",
    "this is related to the models of neutrinos from the galactic plane and from sources of the vcv catalog , which show north - south - symmetries of the neutrino signals in galactic and supergalactic coordinates , respectively . unlike the multipole moments @xmath29",
    ", the @xmath39 do not average over different orientations .",
    "therefore , the analysis of the @xmath39 strongly depends on the used coordinate system .",
    "an example for pulls of @xmath39 for the model of a diffuse neutrino flux from the galactic plane is shown in fig .",
    "[ sub_fig2 ] .",
    "the characteristic periodic behavior of the pulls is explained by the symmetry properties of the spherical harmonics .",
    "the experimental data is analyzed in two steps .",
    "first , the experimental data is tested for its compatibility with the pure atmospheric neutrino hypothesis .",
    "secondly , the experimental pulls are compared with the expectations for the different investigated neutrino models .    .",
    "expected pulls for typical model parameters of isotropic point sources are shown for comparison .",
    "the error bars symbolize the statistical fluctuation expected for an atmospheric neutrino sky map.,width=316 ]     in galactic coordinates .",
    "expected pulls for typical parameters of cosmic ray interactions with the galactic plane are shown for comparison .",
    "the error bars symbolize the statistical fluctuation expected for an atmospheric neutrino sky map.,width=316 ]    the pulls of the experimental data are shown for the multipole moments @xmath29 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and for the expansion coefficients @xmath39 in galactic coordinates in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . to compare the measured data with the expected event distribution , a @xmath31 is calculated for the multipole moments @xmath29 and the expansion coefficients @xmath39 for transformations into equatorial , galactic and supergalactic coordinates separately . as no signal model",
    "is tested @xmath42 is assumed . a comparison with the corresponding @xmath31 distributions results in the p - values giving the probability to obtain a @xmath31 which is at least as extreme as the measured one assuming that the pure atmospheric neutrino hypothesis is true ( table [ p - values ] ) .",
    "the statistical consistency of @xmath29 and @xmath39 in equatorial coordinates with the atmospheric expectation is marginal .",
    "rotating to inclined coordinate systems , e.g. galactic and supergalactic , the consistency improves .",
    "the deviation from the pure atmospheric expectation is not compatible with any of the signal models ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] for examples ) .",
    "the discrepancy may be attributed to uncertainties in the theoretical description of the atmospheric neutrino distribution , or to a contribution of unsimulated background of down - going muons mis - reconstructed as up - going , or to the modeling of properties of the amanda detector .",
    ".p - values for the compatibility of experimental data and pure atmospheric neutrino hypothesis . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the signal models are tested by calculating the @xmath31-values of the experimental data using the corresponding sign and weight factors . as the observed deviations do not fit any of the investigated signal models the physical model parameters are constrained .",
    "due to the observed systematic effects affecting mainly the multipole moments @xmath29 and the equatorial expansion coefficients @xmath39 no limits on the models analyzed in the corresponding coordinate systems ( models 1 , 2 and 6 ) are derived .",
    "the other models are less affected .",
    "the limits given below do not include these systematic effects .    a limit on the source strength assuming the vcv source distribution ( model 3 ) is calculated for those sources closer than 100 mpc to the earth . in this model",
    "all sources are expected to have the same strength and energy spectrum . for a typical spectral index of @xmath43 the average source flux",
    "is limited by the experimental data to a differential source flux of @xmath44 in the energy range between 1.6 tev and 1.7 pev .",
    "for the random galactic sources ( model 4 ) , the number of sources is constrained assuming the same source strength and energy spectrum for all sources as well . for a spectral index of @xmath43 ,",
    "the limit on the number of sources is set by amanda to @xmath45 assuming a source strength of @xmath46 or @xmath47 for sources with @xmath48 .",
    "for source fluxes in between the limit can be approximated by assuming linearity between @xmath20 and log@xmath49 .",
    "the differential flux limit obtained from the experimental data on the diffuse neutrino flux from cosmic ray interactions in the galactic plane ( model 5 ) is @xmath50 .",
    "this flux limit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] together with the results of two other amanda analyses and two theoretical flux predictions .",
    "the seven year multipole analysis provides currently the best limit .",
    "however , it is still not in reach of the theoretical predictions .",
    "it is shown that the multipole analysis is sensitive to a wide range of physical topics .",
    "its area of application is in particular the field of many weak sources in transition to diffuse fluxes . with the statistics of seven years of amanda data and improvements of the analysis technique the method",
    "is now restricted by systematic uncertainties in the atmospheric neutrino zenith distribution of the order of a few percent . transforming to coordinate systems less affected by the equatorial zenith angle such as the galactic and supergalactic system physical conclusions are still possible . a compatibility of the measurement with the background expectation of atmospheric neutrinos is observed .",
    "current efforts to better understand the observed systematics would allow an application of the multipole analysis on future high statistic icecube data .",
