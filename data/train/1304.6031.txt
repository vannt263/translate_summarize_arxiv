    "in the standard model of particle physics  ( sm ) , neutrinos are regarded as massless particles .",

    ", the yukawa coupling constants must be extremely small ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "since the coupling constant seems too different from the other yukawa coupling constants to regard it as natural , we might expect that neutrino masses are generated in a different mechanism .",

    "we consider extensions of the sm with new scalars ( in contrast with the seesaw models ) along the viewpoint `` higgs as a probe of new physics '' of this workshop . along my viewpoint `` neutrino as a guide to new physics '' , we investigate only leptophilic scalars which couple only with leptons among fermions because such scalars would contribute to mechanism of generating neutrino masses . in order to give predictions",
    ", it will not be preferred that two new particles appear in an interaction ( lepton``new fermion''``new scalar '' ) .",

    "the leptophilic scalars here are assumed to be light enough ( tev - scale ) to be produced at collider experiments . if the yukawa interaction relates to the neutrino mass matrix , the flavor structure of decays of the new scalar into leptons",

    "if the prediction is experimentally confirmed in the future , we would obtain information on the mechanism of the neutrino mass generation and on parameters ( e.g.  the lightest neutrino mass ) which can not be measured in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
