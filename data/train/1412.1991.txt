    "modern solvency and accounting rules ( solvency ii and ifrs ) require that expected policyholder behaviour is taken into account .",
    "this includes e.g. expected surrender and expected transcription into free policy ( paid - up policy ) .",
    "the expectation is supposed to take into account both the economic conditions under which the behaviour takes place as well as the extent to which intervention is to the benefit of the policyholder .",
    "the economic conditions and how beneficial it is for the policyholder to intervene may change over time .",
    "therefore , one should properly speak of dynamic behaviour models when formalizing these effects in the actuarial valuation formulas . changing economic conditions",
    "could e.g. be a changing level of interest rates , and one idea would be to let the intensity or probability of intervention depend on the current ( possibly stochastic ) level of interest rates .",
    "how beneficial an action is can be formalized by the gain from intervention .",
    "determining the gain may be a delicate issue since both intervening and not intervening opens up for new intervention options in the future that also have to be taken into account .",
    "e.g. , not to surrender typically opens up for surrendering later , and transcription into free policy changes the effect of the surrender option .",
    "this challenge calls for a recursive solution such that the gain is always measuring correctly the tendencies of intervening in the future .",
    "we disregard the economic condition by assuming deterministic interest rates and focus on the latter idea of a recursive formula to deal with the benefit of intervention .",
    "one motivation for this focus is that , perhaps , the external economic conditions are supposed to approximate to the internal benefit .",
    "there exists a range of approaches to modelling of behavioural risk .",
    "one extreme is to say that intervention occurs in a completely arbitrary way , like insurance risk .",
    "we hereby mean that we model the behaviour as independent of everything else in our model than the state of the policyholder and the time measured through calendar time , the policyholder s age , time since initiation , or time to ( deterministic ) retirement . specifically , the behaviour depends on neither the contract the policyholder holds nor the interest rate . with this approach",
    "it is tractable to study various aspects beyond just adding surrender to a survival model .",
    "buchardt et al .",
    "@xcite studied the formalistic interaction between semi - markov modelling of insurance risk and behavioural risk , including duration dependence of mortality and payments in the disability state and recognizing duration dependence of free policy payments .",
    "a simpler exposition is found in buchardt and mller @xcite .",
    "henriksen et al .",
    "@xcite also combine surrender and free policy options and study the impact on reserving from different simplifying assumptions about the dependence between insurance risk and behaviour risk .",
    "another extreme is to say that intervention occurs in a completely rational , optimal way .",
    "we hereby mean that the policyholder , who is assumed to have the same information as the insurance company has , intervenes according to a strategy that maximizes the value of the insurance contract .",
    "this approach was taken in steffensen @xcite , who derived general variational inequalities that characterize the reserve in case of a multi - state markov model for insurance risk and a multi - state model for behavioural risk . in the surrender case , this is known as american option pricing of surrender risk .",
    "other early references based on this approach to surrender risk are grosen and jrgensen @xcite and bacinello @xcite .    in between these extremes exist all different kinds of models where intervention is modelled by an intensity , but where the intensity not only depends on time but also some stochastic factors .",
    "the dependence on the interest rate appears obvious and is thoroughly examined by de giovanni @xcite , who calculate reserves by solving partial differential equations numerically .",
    "there exists a large amount of literature examining relevant explanatory variables but since these studies appear somewhat marginal to our approach we refer to eling and kiesenbauer @xcite and references therein for a comprehensive literature overview .    rather than letting the intensity depend on external factors",
    ", one could let the intensity depend on internal factors relevant to the specific policy . that could e.g. be to take the difference between the surrender value and ( some notion of the ) reserve as a measure of how beneficial an intervention is .",
    "if the reserve compared with the surrender value does not take future intervention options into account , the calculation can be split up in two standard exercises : first , calculate the reserve without intervention and then plug this reserve into the intensity for a calculation including surrender . if the reserve compared with the surrender value does take future intervention into account , the ( usually ) linear thiele differential equation characterizing the reserve becomes in general a non - linear differential equation .",
    "the non - linear term comes from the risk premium with respect to the surrender event that contains a non - linear function of the reserve itself .",
    "the rationale for this paper is to take a thorough look at this non - linear differential equation in order to motivate it , interpret it , generalize it , and solve it numerically .",
    "last but not least , we present a probabilistic proof of and clarify sufficient conditions for a convergence result that may seem intuitively clear : if the tendency to intervene tends to zero whenever the gain from intervention is negative and tends to infinity whenever the gain from intervention is positive , we reach in the limit at the reserve based on completely rational behaviour .",
    "we establish sufficient convergence of intensities to reach such a conclusion .",
    "thus , our approach to intervention option pricing has two purposes : first , it represents in itself a relevant approach in between the two extremes that , certainly , takes into account the extent to which intervention is to the benefit of the policyholder .",
    "second , for simple parametric forms of the intensity , our calculation approximates the largest possible liability .",
    "as such it can be used as a worst - case or stress calculation with respect to surrender risk .    the idea of approximating the maximum value by a series of solutions to differential equation has been known as the penalty method .",
    "in computational finance it has been used as an approximation method for american option pricing . in forsyth and vetzal",
    "@xcite the penalty method is compared with alternative techniques for pricing of the american put option . in gad and pedersen @xcite the modelling of non",
    "- rational option holder behaviour is studied in a way similar to what is done here .",
    "the contribution of the present paper is three - fold : first , we introduce , to the knowledge of the authors , for the first time the penalty method in intervention option pricing in insurance .",
    "second , we prove sufficient conditions for the convergence to hold .",
    "third , we do not only think of the intensity model as a means of approximating the largest value , but as a highly relevant approach to general intervention option pricing , useful in accounting and solvency .",
    "the approach balances arbitrariness and benefit in a simple form , and in some examples we catch the notion of rationality in one single parameter .",
    "consider a model with a policyholder who is either alive ( active ) or dead .",
    "we assume the state of the policyholder is governed by a state process with a deterministic , continuous death intensity , @xmath0 , see figure [ fig : ad ] .",
    "let @xmath1 be the process indicating whether the policyholder is alive , and let @xmath2 be the process counting the numbers of deaths of the policyholder .",

    "she pays a deterministic premium with continuous intensity @xmath4 until a terminal time , @xmath5 , as long as she is alive .",
    "if she is alive at time @xmath5 she receives a deterministic pension sum @xmath6 , and if she dies before then upon death she gets a deterministic death sum , @xmath7 .",

    "we now add to our model the possibility that the policyholder surrenders .",
    "that is , we add the possibility that the policyholder terminates her contract and instead receives a deterministic , continuous surrender value , @xmath17 .",
    "this can , e.g. , be added to the model by assuming that the policyholder at any time surrenders with some deterministic , continuous intensity , @xmath18 , see figure [ fig : ads1 ] .",

    "the reserve , @xmath20 , is continuously differentiable and solves the following thiele s differential equation , see e.g. @xcite , @xmath21with @xmath22 .    for @xmath23 to be continuously differentiable",
    "we need , in general , that @xmath24 is continuous as assumed above .",
    "however , what is really needed is that @xmath25 is continuous and this can be obtained even when @xmath26 is discontinuous and properly defined at the point where @xmath27",
    ".    the surrender value @xmath28 can be anything exogenously given .",
    "in practice it is , typically , a technical value of the same payment stream based on technical assumptions on interest rates and intensities that we denote by @xmath29 . in that case , the surrender value is the technical reserve @xmath30 that solves ( [ eq : thiele ] ) with @xmath31 replaced by @xmath29 .",
    "the forthcoming solvency ii regulations requires that the traditional modelling of surrender is revisited . in article 79 of the solvency ii directive",
    "it is stated that _ `` any assumptions made by insurance and reinsurance undertakings with respect to the likelihood that policyholders will exercise contractual options , including lapses and surrender , shall be realistic and based on current and credible information .",
    "the assumptions shall take account , either explicitly or implicitly , of the impact that future changes in financial and non - financial conditions may have on the exercise of those options''_. thus , we need to investigate and model what influences the policyholders choice to surrender and we need to be able to calculate the reserves in the more advanced models . in the present section",
    "we suggest a way to do this , and discuss our method .    in a more realistic model of surrender",
    "we want to be able to express both that surrender is likely influenced by how profitable it is , but also that it is still random . on one hand , we wish surrender to be influenced by how profitable it is , because surrender is a decision the policyholder makes .",
    "on the other hand we also have multiple reasons for surrender being random .",
    "randomness is natural because the policyholder most likely lacks information to decide what is profitable .",
    "even if she had all the information that the pension fund has and were able to use it , then her preferences may differ seemingly randomly from the model set up by the pension fund because of the policyholders personal preference and economical situation .",
    "she might shift her job and get an offer from a new pension fund or she might need cash for a divorce .",
    "we can obtain randomness in our model by keeping the surrender modelled by an intensity .",
    "further , we model that the policyholders decision depends on how profitable it is by letting the surrender intensity depend on how profitable it is for the policyholder to surrender .",
    "if she surrenders at time @xmath32 she gains @xmath17 , but she loses the rest of the contract including her right to exercise later .",
    "hence , she loses @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , we denote by @xmath34 her profit from surrendering at time @xmath32 .",
    "we would like the surrender intensity to be non - negative and increasing in this profit . at first glance",
    "this modelling seems to have a problem that the definition of the surrender intensity is circular .",
    "however , theorem [ thm : surde ] below gives sufficient conditions for this circular definition not to be a problem .",
    "[ thm : surde ] for some given non - negative function , @xmath35 , consider the following differential equation in the function @xmath36 : @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "suppose ( [ eq : thieleint1 ] ) has a unique solution , @xmath36 , and define a surrender intensity by @xmath39 .",
    "then @xmath36 is the reserve when the policyholder chooses to surrender at time @xmath40 with intensity @xmath19 .",
    "proof : the possible problem in this model is the circular definition of the surrender intensity .",
    "however , the existence and uniqueness of the solution to both ( [ eq : thieleg1 ] ) and ( [ eq : thieleint1 ] ) ensures that this does not become a problem .",
    "the process @xmath26 defined by @xmath41 is uniquely determined from ( [ eq : thieleint1 ] ) and the reserve is then uniquely determined from ( [ eq : thieleg1 ] ) .",
    "it follows from the definition of @xmath36 that @xmath36 solves ( [ eq : thieleg1 ] ) , and then from the uniqueness of the solution to ( [ eq : thieleg1 ] ) it follows that the reserve is given by @xmath36 .",
    "once we have decided on a policyholder with a specific policy and a function @xmath35 , and thereby also @xmath26 , then for this single policyholder , our model does not differ from a model with a deterministic time dependent surrender intensity as what we had in the classical model of ( [ eq : thieleg1 ] ) . however , when we use the model for pricing a portfolio of insurance contracts for a group of policyholders , then the model assigns different surrender intensities to each policyholder .",
    "thereby , the reserves in general become higher than if we had used a constant surrender intensity or a specific time dependent surrender intensity for the whole portfolio .",
    "the relation between the surrender intensity and the profitability may be chosen in many different ways .",
    "two examples we investigate are : @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 are constants . for equation ( [ eq : surintexp ] ) , @xmath44 tells about the overall tendency to surrender , whereas @xmath46 tells about how profitability creates deviations from this tendency . for equation ( [ eq : surintabs ] ) ,",
    "@xmath46 controls both . in both cases we speak of @xmath46 as the rationality parameter .",
    "other intensity functions can be chosen and one should choose a functional form which matches with data .",
    "the only mathematical requirement is that the function @xmath35 has to make it possible to use theorem [ thm : surde ] .",
    "one immediate drawback of our model is that we most often do not have an explicit solution for the differential equation ( [ eq : thieleint1 ] ) .",
    "this implies that we do not have an explicit expression for the reserve .",
    "however , we do have algorithms available for numerical solutions to ordinary differential equations .",
    "the idea of modelling behaviour by profit dependent intensities may be used for other applications as well .",
    "within life insurance the policyholder s choice to convert into free policy ( paid - up policy ) has some resemblance with the surrender choice .",
    "thereby we may find it reasonable to expand our model with the possibility of conversion into free policy in the same way as we added surrender .",
    "figure [ fig : adsf ] displays a simple model where @xmath47 denotes the intensity of conversion into free policy , @xmath48 denotes the intensity of surrender when active and @xmath49 denotes the intensity of surrender after converted into free policy . here",

    "now , we assume that the intensities are reserve dependent and given in the form @xmath59 then the reserves are given from the following differential equations : @xmath60 the only requirement is that the system of differential equations has a unique solution . however , the differential equations from above are heavy to work with , as we need to solve a new differential equation for each value of @xmath61 .",
    "when modelling the free policy option , this problem is usually overcome by introducing a scaling function , @xmath62 , that describes the reduction of payments as a result of the conversion to free policy .",

    "in the two previous sections we discussed our model with reserve dependent surrender and we found it being a reasonable model for predicting the dynamics of surrender .",
    "however , in the following section we discuss how the model may also be used for determining worst case reserves when the true dynamics of the surrender intensity is not known .",
    "this is because our model is a version of what in the literature is known as the penalty method , and a large rationality parameter gives us the worst case reserve .",
    "typically the technical reserve is paid out upon surrender ( potentially minus expenses ) . in that case , if we take maximum of the technical reserve and the market reserve calculated under the assumption of no surrender , then we get a worst case reserve of either surrendering immediately or never surrender .",
    "however , a surrender strategy somewhere in between the two extremes may result in a higher market reserve . for determining the worst case reserve",
