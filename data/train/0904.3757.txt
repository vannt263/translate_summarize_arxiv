    "laplacians arise in many different mathematical contexts ; three in particular that will interest us : manifolds , graphs and fractals .",
    "there are connections relating these different types of laplacians .",
    "manifold laplacians may be obtained as limits of graph laplacians for graphs arising from triangulations of the manifold ( @xcite ) .",
    "kigami s approach of construction laplacians on certain fractals , such as the sierpinski gasket ( sg ) , also involves taking limits of graph laplacians for graphs that approximate the fractal ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we present another connection , where we approximate the fractal from without by planar domains , and attempt to capture spectral information about the fractal laplacian from spectral information about the standard laplacian on the domains .",
    "thus we add an arrow to the diagram : @xmath0 \\ar[dr ] & \\\\ \\mbox{manifolds } \\ar@{.>}[rr ] & & \\mbox{fractals } } \\ ] ] we should point out that the probabilistic approach to constructing laplacians on fractals also involves approximating from without , but in that case it is the stochastic process generated by the laplacian that is approximated , so it is not clear how to obtain spectral information .",
    "we may describe our method succinctly as follows .",
    "suppose we have a self - similar fractal @xmath1 in the plane , determined by the identity @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a finite set of contractive similarities ( called an _ iterated function system , _ ifs ) .",
    "choose a bounded open set @xmath4 whose closure contains @xmath1 , and form the sequence of domains @xmath5 consider the standard laplacian @xmath6 on @xmath7 with neumann boundary conditions ( recall that such conditions make sense even for domains with rough boundary ) .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the eigenvalues in increasing order ( repeated in case of nontrivial multiplicity ) with eigenfunctions @xmath9 ( @xmath10 normalized ) .",
    "so @xmath11 of course @xmath12 with @xmath13 constant .",
    "we then hope to find a renormalization factor @xmath14 such that @xmath15 exists and @xmath16 exists .",
    "( we have to be careful in cases of nontrivial multiplicity , and we may have to adjust @xmath17 by a minus sign in general ) .",
    "if this is the case then we may simply define a self - adjoint operator @xmath6 on @xmath1 by @xmath18 of course we would also like to identify @xmath6 with a previously defined laplacian , if such is possible , or at least show that @xmath6 is a local operator satisfying some sort of self - similarity .",
    "this may seem like wishful thinking , but it is not implausible .",
    "after all , many other types of structures on fractals can be obtained as limits of structures on @xmath7 , so why not a laplacian ?",
    "after reading this paper , we hope the reader will agree that there is a lot of evidence that this method should work in many cases .",
    "we leave to the future the challenge of describing exactly when it works , and why .",
    "we note one great advantage of our method : it not only approximates the laplacian , but it gives information about the spectrum .",
    "other methods of constructing laplacians on fractals do not yield spectral information directly .",
    "of course , not all spectral information is immediately available . in particular ,",
    "asymptotic information must be lost , since we know from weyl s law that @xmath19 for each fixed @xmath20 , but for fractals laplacians this is not the case .",
    "this means , in particular , that the limit ( [ one4 ] ) is not uniform in @xmath21 . to get information about @xmath22 for large",
    "@xmath21 requires taking a large value for @xmath20 . in practice ,",
    "our numerical calculations get stuck around @xmath23 .",
    "so we only see an approximation to a segment at the bottom of the spectrum .",
    "but this is already enough to reveal aspects of the spectrum that are provable .",
    "briefly , if the fractal has a nontrivial finite group of symmetries , then every neumann eigenfunction can be miniaturized , and so there is an eigenvalue renormalization factor @xmath24 such that if @xmath25 is an eigenvalue then so is @xmath26 . the argument for this works for the approximating domains and also for a self - similar laplacian on the fractal .",
    "( in fact the argument could be presented on the fractal alone , so its validity is independent of the validity of the outer approximation method , but in fact it was discovered by examining the experimental data ! )    so what is the evidence for the validity of the outer approximation method ?",
    "first we show that it works for the case when @xmath1 is the unit interval ( embedded in the x - axis in the plane ) . in this case",
    "we can take @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "if we take @xmath4 to be the unit square , then we can compute the spectra of @xmath7 ( rectangles ) and verify everything by hand ( @xmath29 in this case ) .",
    "we do this in section [ secunit ] , where we also look at different choices of @xmath4 , producing sawtooth shaped domains , whose spectra are computed numerically .    in section [ secgasket ]",
    "we look at the case of sg , where the spectrum is known exactly . here",
    "we see numerically how the spectra of the approximating domains approaches the known spectra .",
    "this computation shows that the accuracy falls off rapidly as @xmath21 increases .",
    "we are also able to compare the eigenfunctions of the approximating domains with the known eigenfunctions on sg . in this case",
    "it is natural to take @xmath4 to be a triangle containing sg in its interior since this yields connected domains @xmath7 .",
    "we examine how the size of the overlap influences the spectra . after",
    "the work reported in section [ secgasket ] was completed , a different approach to outer approximation on sg was studied in @xcite . in particular , different methods for choosing approximating domains are used , and a whole family of different laplacians are studied .    in section [ secnonpcf ]",
    "we examine numerical data for some fractals for which very little had been known about the spectrum of the laplacian , and in some cases where even the existence of a laplacian is unknown .",
    "these examples fall outside of the postcritically finite ( pcf ) category defined in @xcite .",
    "the first example is the standard sierpinski carpet sc ( cut out the middle square in tic - tac - toe and iterate ) .",
    "here it is known that a self - similar laplacian exists @xcite , but the construction is indirect , and uniqueness is not known .",
    "( after this work was completed , uniqueness was established in @xcite . )",
    "but we also examine some nonsymmetric variants of sc for which the existence of a laplacian is unknown .",
    "we also examine a symmetric fractal , the octagasket , where existence of a laplacian is unknown . in all cases",
    "the spectra of the approximating regions appear to converge when appropriately renormalized .",
    "we can identify features of the spectrum , such as multiple eigenvalues , and eigenvalue renormalization factors @xmath24 , and we produce rough graphs of eigenfunctions on the fractal . in particular , there is no discernible difference between the behavior in the case of the standard sc and the other examples .    in section [ secmini ]",
    "we describe the miniaturization process that produces the eigenvalue renormalization factor . for this to work",
    "we need a dihedral group of symmetries of the fractal .",
    "we only deal with the examples at hand , but it is clear that it works quite generally ( we also explain how it works on the square ) . for the approximating regions ,",
    "this shows how @xmath30 shows up in the spectrum on @xmath31 ( the factor @xmath32 is not the same as @xmath24 ) .",
    "in section [ secranc ] we examine numerical data of randomly constructed variants of sc , where the existence of laplacians is unknown . to make these carpets , we modify the construction of sc .",
    "we fix the number of squares cut out at each recursive step , but we randomly determine which squares are removed . then , we achieve connected domains @xmath7 with a suitable change to the above algorithm and properly chosen parameters . here",
    "we again see convergence of normalized eigenvalues .",
    "these random carpets are related to the mandelbrot percolation process .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite , for example .    how do we compute the spectrum of the laplacian on the approximating domain ?",
    "we use a finite element method solver in matlab , matlab s own ` pdeeig ` function .",
    "to do this we only need to describe the geometry of the polygonal domain @xmath7",
    ". then we either choose a triangulation ( exclusive to section [ secranc ] ) or let matlab s triangulation functions ` decsg ` and ` initmesh ` produce a triangulation and then use piecewise linear splines in the finite element method .",
    "note that it would be preferable to use higher - order splines , at least piecewise cubic , since these increase accuracy dramatically for a fixed memory space and running time . as a concession ,",
    "all of our triangulations may be further refined with the ` refinemesh ` function .",
    "the advantage of automating the triangulation is that it saves a tremendous amount of work ; in particular it chooses nonregular triangulations that increase accuracy .",
    "the disadvantage is that the program usually does not pick a triangulation with the same symmetry as the domain .",
    "this means that the eigenspaces that have nontrivial multiplicity in the domain end up being split into clusters of eigenspaces with eigenvalues close but not quite equal . since a lot of the structure of the spectrum we are trying to observe has to do with multiplicities ,",
    "this forces us to make ad hoc judgements as to when we have close but unequal eigenvalues , versus multiple eigenvalues .",
    "why do we deal exclusively with neumann spectra ?",
    "the main reason is that neumann boundary conditions on the approximating domains appears to lead to neumann boundary conditions for the laplacian on the fractal in the case of the interval and sg , while at the same time dirichlet boundary conditions on the approximating domains do not lead to dirichlet boundary conditions for the laplacian on the fractal .",
    "for example , in the case of the interval you would need to use a mix of dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions on different portions of the boundary .",
    "it is not at all clear what to do for other fractals . indeed for sc",
    "it is not even clear what to choose for the boundary .",
    "the advantage of neumann boundary conditions is that one can dispense with all notions of boundary , and define eigenfunctions simply as stationary points of the rayleigh quotient with no boundary restrictions .",
    "all our programs , as well as further numerical data may be found on the websites ` www.math.cornell.edu/~thb9d ` [ and ` www.math.cornell.edu/~smh82 ` ] .",
    "finally , we note that @xcite have studied similar outer approximations in the context of quantum graphs .",
    "for the unit interval @xmath33 with the second derivative as laplacian , the neumann eigenfunctions are @xmath34 with eigenvalues @xmath35 . if we take @xmath4 to be the unit square , then @xmath7 is the rectangle @xmath36\\times[0,2^{-m}]$ ] , with neumann eigenfunctions @xmath37 and eigenvalues @xmath38 .",
    "if we restrict attention to a fixed bottom segment of the spectrum , we will see eigenvalues with @xmath39 just for @xmath20 large enough ( specifically , eigenvalues up to @xmath40 provided @xmath41 ) .",
    "so @xmath42 exactly for large enough @xmath20 .",
    "of course the corresponding eigenfunctions restricted to the interval give the exact eigenfunctions of the laplacian on the interval .",
    "note that for each @xmath20 there are many other eigenfunctions on @xmath7 ( those with @xmath43 ) , but they are `` blown away '' in the limit .",
    "a similar analysis holds if we start with @xmath4 equal to any rectangle with sides parallel to the axes .",
    "note that we do not have to renormalize the spectrum , or equivalently , we can take @xmath29 in ( [ one4 ] ) .",
    "we also note how other structures on @xmath33 may be approximated from corresponding structures on @xmath7 .",
    "for example , lebesgue measure on @xmath33 is the limit of lebesgue measure on @xmath7 suitably renormalized in the sense that @xmath44 if @xmath45 is continuous on @xmath4 ( the result is independent of the continuous extension @xmath45 to @xmath4 of @xmath46 on @xmath33 ) .",
    "a similar result holds for energy , provided we use the minimum energy extension . in other words , given @xmath47 ,",
    "let @xmath48 be the minimum energy function with @xmath49 .",
    "then @xmath50 in order to see this we expand @xmath51 in a fourier cosine series @xmath52 for which we have @xmath53 the minimum energy extension to @xmath7 is easily seen to be @xmath54 with @xmath55 then ( [ two2 ] ) follows from ( [ two4 ] ) and ( [ two6 ] ) . note that we obtain the same result if we use the simpler extension @xmath56 , although this extension does not minimize energy .",
    "( the energy minimizing extension must be harmonic on the interior and satisfy neumann boundary conditions on the portion of the boundary of @xmath7 disjoint from @xmath33 , and this explains ( [ two5 ] ) ) .",
    "we also have a bilinear version : let @xmath57 and @xmath58 if @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote the minimum energy extensions of @xmath51 and @xmath61 to @xmath7 , then @xmath62 we can use this to `` define '' a laplacian on @xmath33 via the weak formulation @xmath63 if @xmath61 vanishes at @xmath64 and @xmath65 . by the usual gauss - green formula @xmath66 and @xmath67 on all of @xmath68 except @xmath33 , where @xmath69 , so @xmath70 combining ( [ two9 ] ) , ( [ two10 ] ) and ( [ two12 ] ) yields at least formally @xmath71 we can verify this by differentiating ( [ two5 ] ) directly ( assuming @xmath51 is smooth enough ) to obtain @xmath72 and taking the limit to obtain @xmath73 and this is the same value for @xmath74 that we obtain by differentiating ( [ two3 ] ) directly .    for a less trivial example",
    "we need only to take a geometrically more interesting @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , let @xmath4 be a triangle with vertices @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 for some choice of positive parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "then @xmath7 is a sawtooth region with @xmath80 teeth , maximum height @xmath81 and overlaps of length @xmath82 .",
    "it is not feasible to compute the neumann spectrum of the @xmath7 exactly , so we use numerical methods . in tables",
    "[ tabletwo1 ] and [ tabletwo3 ] we present the eigenvalues for several choices of parameters and level @xmath83 ( we also vary the number of refinements used in the fem approximation ) .",
    "actually the computations are done for a similar image of @xmath7 so that the base is exactly @xmath33 , but this makes no difference in the limit .",
    "the evidence suggests that we get @xmath84 in the limit for some constant that depends on the parameters .    in tables [ tabletwo2 ] and [ tabletwo4 ] we present the same data , but we normalize by dividing @xmath85 by @xmath86 .",
    "this enables us to compare the normalized eigenvalues with the expected values @xmath87 .",
    "note that with level @xmath88 we see about a @xmath89 deviation already at @xmath90 .",
    "in figure [ figtwo1 ] we show some graphs of eigenfunctions on @xmath7 , that approximate eigenfunctions on @xmath33 . in figure [ figtwo2 ]",
    "we show the graph of an eigenfunction on @xmath91 that does not approximate an eigenfunction on @xmath33 .",
    "indeed , this eigenfunction appears to be almost localized to one of the teeth .",
    "this phenomenon is discussed in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know if we can define energy on @xmath33 via ( [ two2 ] ) for a sawtooth region approximation .",
    "indeed , we have no idea what the minimum energy extension looks like .",
    "there is yet another outer approximation approach to @xmath33 , in which we regard it as the bottom line in sg .",
    "so we take @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "then @xmath7 is a fractafold in the sense of @xcite consisting of @xmath80 cells of level @xmath20 along the bottom of sg .",
    "the bottom @xmath80 neumann eigenfunctions of the fractal laplacian on @xmath7 are obtained by the method of spectral decimation as follows .",
    "fix a parameter @xmath94 satisfying @xmath95 .",
    "let @xmath96 for @xmath97 denote the points along @xmath33 where the cells of @xmath7 intersect , and let @xmath98 for @xmath99 denote the top vertices of the cells ( so cell number @xmath100 has vertices @xmath101 ) .",
    "then @xmath102 restricted to these points is defined by @xmath103 one can check that for a graph laplacian @xmath104 on the graph @xmath105 we have @xmath106 with the appropriate neumann conditions at the boundary points @xmath107 .",
    "let @xmath108 and @xmath109 where @xmath110 denotes the n - fold composition .",
    "in particular , @xmath111 is a smooth function with @xmath112 and @xmath113",
    ". then the method of spectral decimation ( see @xcite for a detailed explanation ) says that @xmath102 may be extended to eigenfunctions of the fractal laplacian on @xmath7 with eigenvalue @xmath114 now observe that @xmath115 for large @xmath20 so @xmath116 of course @xmath117 is the correct eigenvalue for the eigenfunction @xmath118 on @xmath33 , which is clearly the limit of @xmath102 as @xmath119 .",
    "let @xmath120 denote the vertices of a unit length equilateral triangle in the plane , and let @xmath121 for @xmath122 .",
    "then sg is the invariant set for this ifs .",
    "we take @xmath4 to be the equilateral triangle dilated by a factor @xmath123 .",
    "then @xmath7 is a union of @xmath124 triangles of size @xmath125 that overlap in triangles of size @xmath126 .    in tables",
    "[ tablethree1 ] and [ tablethree2 ] we present the same data as in tables [ tabletwo1 ] through [ tabletwo4 ] for this example .",
    "the multiplicities and normalized eigenvalues agree with the known values for the neumann spectrum of the standard laplacian on sg @xcite .",
    "for example , the first six distinct normalized eigenvalues on sg are @xmath127 .",
    "so the numerical accuracy improves as we decrease @xmath78 but the error remains significant .",
    "( much better accuracy is achieved in @xcite ) . nevertheless , the qualitative features of the spectrum , including high multiplicities and large gaps , are already apparent . in figure [ figthree1 ]",
    "we show some graphs of eigenfunctions .",
    "actual graphs of dirichlet eigenfunctions on sg may be found in @xcite .    in this case",
    "we know the eigenfunction renormalization factor @xmath128 , so we expect @xmath129 in ( [ one4 ] ) .",
    "the data is not inconsistent with this expectation , but it is impossible to deduce these values from the data alone .",
    "we also look at the case @xmath130 , where the @xmath124 triangles in @xmath7 intersect at single points .",
    "thus the interior of @xmath7 consists of @xmath124 disjoint triangles , and if we interpret the neumann laplacian on @xmath7 in the usual way , the spectrum would just be @xmath124 copies of the spectrum of @xmath4 .",
    "this is nothing like the spectrum of sg , and also it is not what we get when we use the fem .",
    "the reason is that the spline space chosen consists of continuous functions , and this effectively couples the disjoint triangles at their junction points .",
    "effectively this means that we are not looking at the entire sobolev space @xmath131 , but only the subspace @xmath132 defined to be the closure of continuous functions in @xmath131 in the sobolev norm .",
    "in fact , functions in @xmath132 do not have to be continuous ( or even bounded ) , since @xmath133 does not embed in continuous functions on @xmath134 .",
    "they do have to satisfy some integral continuity condition ( see @xcite for analogous results for @xmath135 on a half - line ) .",
    "the conclusion is that the neumann eigenvalues ( and eigenfunctions ) that the fem approximates are the stationary values ( and associated functions ) for the rayleigh quotient @xmath136 for some @xmath137 .",
    "of course some of these eigenfunctions restrict to neumann eigenfunctions on each triangle in @xmath7 and are continuous functions at the junction points , but it is easy to see that there are not enough of these ( in fact the smallest such eigenvalue must be on the order of magnitude @xmath138 ) .",
    "we claim that all the other eigenfunctions have poles at some junction points .",
    "indeed , consider the restriction of an eigenfunction to a triangle . because it is a neumann eigenfunction",
    ", it must have vanishing normal derivatives along the side of the triangle .",
    "choose a vertex of the triangle and reflect the eigenfunction evenly six times around .",
    "this yields an eigenfunction in a deleted neighborhood of the vertex .",
    "the removable singularities theorem yields the following dichotomy : either the function is unbounded or it satisfies the eigenvalue equation at the vertex .",
    "if it satisfies the eigenvalue equation at all three vertices of the triangle , then the restriction to the triangle is a neumann eigenvalue , contrary to our assumption .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the singularities must be logarithmic poles .    with this in mind",
    ", we look at the eigenvalue data in tables [ tablethree3 ] and [ tablethree4 ] . in contrast to our preceding computations",
    ", we do not see an apparent convergence of eigenvalues on a fixed @xmath7 when we increase the refinement of the triangulation .",
    "in particular the numerical values in table [ tablethree4 ] are even better than the data in table [ tablethree2 ] . in other words , the poor approximations by the fem to the actual eigenvalues on @xmath7 yield",
    "very good approximations to the relative eigenvalues on sg .",
    "we can even extract rather decent estimates for @xmath129 from the data in table [ tablethree3 ] if we pair off corresponding refinements at different levels .",
    "for example , if we compute @xmath139 using 3 refinements on level 3 and 4 refinements on level 4 , the first six distinct eigenvalues yield ratios @xmath140 .",
    "of course the eigenfunctions on @xmath7 can not approximate the eigenfunctions on sg , since the latter are bounded .",
    "since we are already getting more information than we deserve , we might speculate that the eigenfunction approximation might be accurate in the complement of a small neighborhood of the junction points .",
    "our first example is the octagasket , generated by eight contractive homotheties with contraction ratio @xmath141 and fixed points @xmath142 the vertices of a regular octagon .",
    "then the consecutive images @xmath143 and @xmath144 intersect along a cantor set . as",
    "yet , there has been no construction of a self - similar laplacian on this fractal , although it is reasonable to expect the probabilistic methods in @xcite will work , given the high symmetry in this example .",
    "it is natural to approximate from without by taking @xmath4 to be the interior of the octagon with vertices @xmath142 .",
    "then @xmath7 consists of the interior of the union of @xmath145 octagons that meet along edges .    in table",
    "[ tablefour1 ] we give the eigenvalues on @xmath7 for @xmath146 along with level - to - level ratios , suggesting a renormalization factor of about @xmath147 . in table",
    "[ tablefour2 ] we normalize the eigenvalues by dividing by @xmath86 .",
    "this suggests an eigenvalue renormalization factor of about @xmath148 ( the table indicates when a new eigenvalue appears that is approximately @xmath149 for an earlier value of @xmath21 ) . in the next section",
    "we will explain why this happens .",
    "the tables show eigenvalues of multiplicities 1 and 2 , but no higher multiplicities .",
    "the @xmath150 symmetry forces multiplicity 2 , since there are three irreducible representations of dimension 2 .",
    "there are a number of close coincidences ( for example 910.5058 and 910.8645 , each with multiplicity 2 ) , but not close enough to be regarded as the same , in our judgement .",
    "there is some evidence of large gaps in the spectrum , for example ( 66.45202,122.0411 ) , ( 162.1709,223.2267 ) and ( 253.6123,336.1848 ) .",
    "however , there is not enough data to guess whether or not there are infinitely many gaps ( @xmath151 for fixed @xmath78 ) . in figure [ figfour1 ] we display the graphs of some eigenfunctions , and in figure [ figfour2 ] we show the weyl ratios .    the weyl ratio is defined to be @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the eigenvalue counting function , and @xmath154 is its approximate growth rate . we determine @xmath155 experimentally as the slope of the line of best fit to a log - log plot of @xmath156 .",
    "the weyl ratio gives a nice `` snapshot '' of the spectrum .",

    "we will give an explanation of this behavior .",

    "the @xmath166 carpet has @xmath160 symmetry and it is known that a self - similar laplacian exists .",

    "this shows that @xmath176 is also a neumann eigenfunction , and indeed @xmath180 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath48 is an odd eigenfunction , then define @xmath181 by @xmath182 again @xmath183 because @xmath48 is odd , so @xmath181 is also a neumann eigenfunction , and again @xmath184 .",
    "we call @xmath176 or @xmath181 the miniaturization of @xmath48 .",
    "note that the representation type of the miniaturization is always even .",
    "the eigenvalue of @xmath176 or @xmath181 is always 4 times the eigenvalue of @xmath48 .",
    "thus @xmath185 is an eigenvalue renormalization factor .",
    "( of course @xmath33 has other eigenvalue renormalization factors , namely any square integer , but such luxuries do not generalize to other fractals ) .",
    "now consider a self - similar fractal with a finite group of symmetries @xmath186 , and suppose the laplacian is @xmath186 invariant",
    ". then each eigenspace splits according to the irreducible representations of @xmath186 .",
    "we seek to find a set of recipes , analogous to ( [ five1 ] ) and ( [ five2 ] ) , to miniaturize eigenfunctions according to the corresponding irreducible representations of @xmath186 .",
    "in fact , our goal is to obtain recipes that make sense on the fractal and also on the outer approximating domains . in the latter case",
    "the miniaturization of an eigenfunction on @xmath7 will be an eigenfunction on @xmath31 .",
    "it is by no means clear that this goal is always attainable .",
    "we will show explicitly that it is possible for sc , the @xmath166 carpet , and the octagasket . in the first two examples the symmetry group is @xmath160 ( the dihedral symmetry group of the square ) , and in the last example it is @xmath150 .",
    "in contrast to the interval , the representation type of the miniaturized eigenfunctions is the same as the original one .",
    "the referee has pointed out that it is also possible to explain miniaturization on carpets using local reflection maps introduced in @xcite and @xcite ( see also definition @xmath187 in @xcite ) .",
    "we mention in passing that a version of miniaturization is valid for sg , but the recipes are more complicated . in particular , the multiplicities increase .",
    "this is part of the story of spectral decimation ( see @xcite for a description ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clear how to extend the recipes for the approximating domains @xmath7 with a positive @xmath78 overlap , although they are presumably valid in the zero overlap case .",
    "the symmetry group @xmath160 has five irreducible representations .",
    "let @xmath188 and @xmath189 denote the reflections about the horizontal and vertical axes in @xmath160 , and @xmath190 and @xmath191 denote the two diagonal reflections .",
    "the four one - dimensional representations @xmath161 , and @xmath162 are characterized by parity with respect to these reflections .",
    "( strictly speaking , we describe functions that transform according to the representations , rather than the abstract representations , since we are interested in eigenfunctions that transform according to representations ) .",
    "functions transforming according to @xmath192 are even with respect to all reflections , and those transforming according to @xmath162 are odd with respect to all reflections .",
    "the @xmath193 functions are odd with respect to @xmath188 and @xmath189 and even with respect to @xmath190 and @xmath191 , while for @xmath194 the reverse holds .",
    "now suppose @xmath48 is a neumann eigenfunction on @xmath7 of @xmath192 or @xmath194 type .",
    "define the miniaturization @xmath195 for either the sc or @xmath166 carpet . on the other hand , for an eigenfunction of @xmath193 or @xmath162",
    "type define @xmath196 where we alternate the choice of @xmath197 on neighboring cells ( see figure[figfive1 ] ) . because of the even or odd parity of @xmath48 with respect to the reflections @xmath188 and @xmath189 , the miniaturized functions are continuous along the boundaries of the cells of order one .",
    "since @xmath48 satisfies neumann boundary conditions , it follows that @xmath176 or @xmath181 satisfy matching conditions along these boundaries , hence they are neumann eigenfunctions on @xmath198 , and the eigenvalue is multiplied by @xmath199 where @xmath25 denotes the contraction ratio of the @xmath200 mappings ( so @xmath201 for sc and @xmath202 for the @xmath166 carpet ) . note that on the @xmath166 carpet , the miniaturized eigenfunction has the same representation type as @xmath48 , while on sc , @xmath176 preserves representation type while @xmath181 maps @xmath193 to @xmath192 and @xmath162 to @xmath194 .",
    "cc & +   + &    there is also a two - dimensional representation of @xmath160 , that we denote by 2 .",
    "the representation space is spanned by functions @xmath48 and @xmath203 satisfying @xmath204 and @xmath205 , @xmath206 .",
    "the miniaturized functions @xmath207 and @xmath208 are shown in figure [ figfive2 ] .",
    "once again we see that @xmath207 and @xmath208 are neumann eigenfunctions on @xmath31 with eigenvalue multiplied by @xmath199 , and the pair transform according to the representation 2 .",
    "what does this tell us about the neumann spectrum on the corresponding fractal ?",
    "if we believe ( [ one4 ] ) then there will be an eigenvalue renormalization factor @xmath209 .",
    "for every eigenvalue @xmath22 , there will be an eigenvalue equal to @xmath149 with equal multiplicity , and the corresponding eigenfunctions will be miniaturizations as illustrated .",
    "cc & +   + & +   + &    but in fact we can run the same miniaturization argument directly on the fractal . indeed , in both cases we know that there exists a laplacian @xmath6 on the fractal satisfying a self - similar identity @xmath210 for a certain constant @xmath24 .",
    "then the miniaturization recipes given above create eigenfunctions with eigenvalue multiplied by @xmath24 .",
    "this is true independent of the validity of the outer approximation method .",
    "incidentally , the miniaturization recipes given above extend easily to any @xmath160 symmetric carpet type fractal .    in our last example ,",
    "the octagasket , the symmetry group is @xmath150 .",
    "here we have four one - dimensional representations .",
    "since @xmath211 we may sort the reflections in @xmath150 into those that are in @xmath160 and those that are not . the representation @xmath192 is described by functions even with respect to all reflections , and @xmath162 by all functions odd with respect to all reflections .",
    "similarly , @xmath193 functions are odd with respect to @xmath160 reflections and even with respect to all other reflections , while for @xmath194 functions the situation is reversed .",
    "the miniaturizations @xmath176 ( for @xmath192 or @xmath193 eigenfunctions ) and @xmath181 ( for @xmath194 or @xmath162 eigenfunctions ) are again given by ( [ five3 ] ) and ( [ five4 ] ) , where the @xmath197 signs alternate along the eight small octagons .",
    "we note that the representation type is preserved under miniaturization .",
    "cc & +   + &    cc & +   + &    in this case there are three two - dimensional representations , denoted @xmath212 . in terms of complex valued functions on the circle , @xmath213 is spanned by @xmath214 , @xmath215 is spanned by @xmath216 , and @xmath217 is spanned by @xmath218 . if @xmath219 denote any consecutive points on an eight element orbit of @xmath150 , then @xmath213 functions satisfy @xmath220 @xmath215 functions satisfy @xmath221 and @xmath217 functions satisfy @xmath222 the @xmath213 and @xmath217 representations have the property that restricted to @xmath160 they become the 2 representation .",
    "so if @xmath223 are the basis described above , the miniaturization @xmath224 are given in figure [ figfive3 ] .",
    "on the other hand , the restriction of @xmath215 to @xmath160 splits into a direct sum of a @xmath193 and a @xmath194 representation .",
    "so we can choose a basis @xmath223 such that @xmath225 and @xmath226 , and the miniaturization @xmath227 is given in figure [ figfive4 ] .",
    "again the representation type is preserved under miniaturization .",
    "some types of miniaturization on the pentagasket are described in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath228 , @xmath229 , we partition the unit square into a grid of @xmath94 by @xmath94 smaller , equally sized squares of width @xmath230 .",
    "we then randomly remove @xmath100 of these smaller squares , where @xmath100 is a small positive integer , and the result is our level 1 domain @xmath231 . to produce @xmath91 , we partition each square of width @xmath230 into a grid of @xmath94 by @xmath94 equally sized squares of width @xmath232 , and we then randomly remove @xmath20 squares of width @xmath232 from each square of width @xmath230 . iterating this process yields a sequence of nested compact domains @xmath233 where @xmath7 is a union of squares of side length @xmath234 . matlab s `",
    "rand('state ' ) ` function , a modified version of marsaglia s subtract - with - borrow algorithm , makes our random choices .",
    "the number generator s state is set according to the exact date and time of the computation , so that the generator s own state is essentially randomly determined . also , to shorten fem computation time we triangulate @xmath7 with the four sides and two diagonals of each square of side length @xmath234 .",
    "the problem we find with our fem eigenvalue problem on these domains is connectivity . how can we guarantee that each @xmath7 has only one path component",
    "also , if two squares are disjoint except at a common vertex , with no other squares in a neighborhood of that vertex , how can we avoid the problem we saw in section [ secgasket ] ?",
    "recall that in this case , the spline space of our finite element solver couples these squares at the common vertex . for simplicity",
    "we resolve both questions by choosing small @xmath100 and altering the above algorithm so that this coupling problem is avoided , as follows .",
    "when we pass from @xmath7 to @xmath31 we partition a square of side length @xmath234 into squares of side length @xmath235 and delete @xmath100 of the smaller squares randomly .",
    "we then check if this deletion process has produced the above coupling problem .",
    "if it has , then we go back and try again ; otherwise , we move on to the next @xmath236 level square , and so on .",
    "for @xmath100 small enough , the algorithm terminates .",
    "figure [ figsix1 ] shows a typical result of the above algorithm .",
    "notice that we have only one path component .",
    "now , we study our spectral information with the eigenvalue counting function @xmath239 , where @xmath156 is the number of nonnegative eigenvalues less than or equal to @xmath157 .",
    "then , we examine the weyl ratio @xmath240 where @xmath154 is an approximate asymptotic bound for @xmath156 , i.e. we choose @xmath241 so that @xmath242 in accordance with the experimental data .",
    "so , finding @xmath155 corresponds to finding the slope of a linear approximation of @xmath156 on a log - log plot .",
    "in fact , since we are dealing with domains in the plane , the weyl asymptotic law implies that @xmath243 is the correct value as @xmath244 .",
    "the point is that we truncate our computations well before we reach the region where this asymptotic behavior is approximated , so we observe values of @xmath155 considerably smaller than @xmath65 .    in our first example , we let @xmath237 and @xmath245 and run our algorithm up to level @xmath246 to get @xmath247 , where @xmath248 is the upper left carpet in figure [ figsix2 ] . from this initial carpet , we can restart our algorithm three separate times , beginning at @xmath249 once for each @xmath250 .",
    "we then end the algorithm again at level @xmath246 and we call the resulting ( level @xmath246 ) carpet which was started at @xmath249 the bifurcation of @xmath248 at level @xmath251 .",
    "the carpets are shown in figure [ figsix2 ] and the eigenvalue data in tables [ tablesix1 ] and [ tablesix2 ] .",
    "next , we let @xmath237 and @xmath252 and do the same bifurcation study .",
    "the carpets are shown in figure [ figsix4 ] and the eigenvalue data in tables [ tablesix3 ] and [ tablesix4 ] .",
    "finally , we fix @xmath237 and vary @xmath100 on different levels so that at level @xmath65 we set @xmath245 , at level @xmath253 we set @xmath252 , etc . a similar procedure for gaskets rather than carpets is discussed in @xcite . our sequence of @xmath100 values for the carpet in figure [ figsix6 ] is @xmath254 .",
    "the eigenvalue data appears in tables [ tablesix5 ] and [ tablesix6 ] .",
    "the level - to - level eigenvalue ratios in table [ tablesix5 ] appear to roughly alternate between the same ratios in tables [ tablesix3 ] and [ tablesix1 ] .",
    "this is the strongest evidence that the geometry of the domain at different scales is reflected in the spectrum of the laplacian .",
    "such a correlation is more striking in @xcite , but the fractals there have a more coherent structure",
    ".    the weyl ratios of our first example ( where @xmath237 and @xmath245 ) appear in figure [ figsix3 ] .",
    "we now look closely at the agreement of the graph of the original carpet to each individual bifurcation .",
    "we see that the original agrees with the bifurcation at level @xmath246 up to about @xmath255 , the original agrees with that at level @xmath256 up to around @xmath257 , and it agrees with the level @xmath253 bifurcation up to about @xmath258 . in our second example ( where @xmath237 and @xmath259 ) we find the weyl ratios in figure [ figsix5 ] .",
    "we do the same comparison .",
    "the original agrees with the the level @xmath246 bifurcation to around @xmath260 , it agrees with the level @xmath256 one up to approximately @xmath261 , and it agrees with the level @xmath253 bifurcation to approximately @xmath262 . in other words ,",
    "the added detail at finer resolutions has only a minimal effect on some initial segment of the spectrum .",
    "this is consistent with results in @xcite .",
    "our final example s weyl ratios ( where @xmath237 and @xmath254 ) are found in figure [ figsix7 ] .    for further comparison of the weyl ratios ,",
    "we show those from another trial with @xmath237 and @xmath245 , and those from another trial where @xmath237 and @xmath252 .",
    "the carpets for the new @xmath237 , @xmath245 trial appear in figure [ figsix8 ] with weyl ratios in figure [ figsix9 ] , while the carpets for the new @xmath237 , @xmath252 trial appear in figure [ figsix10 ] with weyl ratios in figure [ figsix11 ] .",
    "it is clear that different random choices in the construction make a big difference in the spectrum .",
    "we leave to the future the problem of formulating precise conjectures concerning the spectra of different random carpets .",
