    "the puzzlingly large perturbations in the outer hi disk of our galaxy ( levine , blitz & heiles 06 ) may be due to an interaction with a dwarf galaxy ( chakrabarti & blitz 09 ; henceforth cb09 ) .",
    "underlying the search for this culprit is the hope that one could in principle infer characteristics of the galactic potential and sub - structure from a dynamical analysis of observed perturbations in the gas or stellar disk of the milky way , i.e , galactoseismology .",
    "we recently presented evidence of an excess of variables with periods greater than 3 days , and in particular clustered cepheid candidates at @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( chakrabarti et al .",
    "2015 ; henceforth c15 ) from the analysis of @xmath6-band light curves from the vvv survey ( saito et al .",
    "2012 ) . using the @xmath6-band period - luminosity relation of type",
    "i cepheids ( matsunaga et al .",
    "2013 ) , and the cardelli et al .",
    "( 1998 ) extinction law , we derived an average distance of @xmath1 90 kpc from the galactic center , which is close to the current predicted distance of the perturbing dwarf galaxy .    without both light curves and spectroscopic observations ,",
    "it is difficult to understand the nature of variable stars and their dynamical relation to our galaxy . here , we present preliminary results from @xmath10-band spectroscopic observations of three cepheid candidates identified from the analysis of @xmath6-band light curves from the vvv survey .",
    "the average heliocentric radial velocity of these sources is @xmath1 156 km / s , which is large and distinct from the galactic stellar disk ( yanny et al . 2003 ; bond et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "we address the recent claims by pietrukowicz et al .",
    "( 2015 ; henceforth p15 ) that these sources are cool spotted stars , and the broader claims that classification of variables from near - ir light curves is problematic , and that there is no evidence for a dwarf galaxy in this part of the sky",
    ". given that the period of one of these sources has been confirmed by ogle , the main false positive are spotted stars that can mimic the @xmath6-band light curves of cepheids .",
    "however , spotted stars would be part of the galactic stellar disk , while the observed spectra indicate that these objects are moving with a large ( and similar ) radial velocity , which is much larger than that of typical disk stars .",
    "moreover , the distance of these sources as derived from the period - luminosity relation in the @xmath6-band and at @xmath4 are comparable .",
    "our own ongoing i - band photometry indicates variability on roughly the same scale as the period derived from the @xmath6-band light curves .",
    "the @xmath5-band fourier parameters of one of these sources ( p15 ; figure 5 in that paper ) , while not lying in the main part of the distribution of fourier parameters , shows some overlap with smc cepheids , as would be expected for cepheids in a low - metallicity environment . thus , the possibility that this source is a classical cepheid should not be dismissed . finally , the @xmath11 excess of variables in this part of the sky ( c15 ) is difficult to explain without invoking a gravitationally bound structure .",
    "the classification of variable stars using near - ir light curves ( matsunaga et al . 2011 ; 2013 ; angeloni et al . 2014 ) is indeed a relatively new endeavor . while the traditional approach has been to classify variable stars in the optical or @xmath5-band ( soszynski et al .",
    "2011 ) and obtain a few epochs of near - ir photometry to lower the uncertainty on the distance ( feast et al .",
    "2014 ) , the challenge of classifying sources that are faint in the optical bands motivates the development of templates in the near - infrared ( angeloni et al . 2014",
    "; inno et al .",
    "2015 ) , as well as other innovative approaches of multi - color classification with relatively few epochs ( sesar et al . 2012 ) .",
    "light curves of cepheids in the near - ir are nearly sinusoidal ( matsunaga et al .",
    "2012 ) , while light curves in the @xmath5-band tend to show more features ( soszynski et al .",
    "2011 ) , allowing easier classification .",
    "but even with @xmath5-band light curves , the classification is not always accurate .",
    "only five of the thirty - two cepheid candidates identified by soszynski et al .",
    "( 2011 ) were spectroscopically confirmed by feast et al .",
    "( 2014 ) ( while the others are not type i cepheids or else their identification as classical cepheids is uncertain ) .",
    "given the relative paucity of data in the near - ir , it is reasonable to proceed initially with light curves ( with a moderate number of epochs ) and subsequently obtain spectroscopic data , especially for sources close to the galactic plane .",
    "studying galactic structure and sub - structure close to the plane is also a new field .",
    "young cepheid variables ( or a metal - rich component ) are unexpected in models of the galactic halo , especially in the outer halo .",
    "however , gas accretion or infall of gas - rich dwarf galaxies may well produce an yet undiscovered population of type i cepheids in the outer galaxy .",
    "bullock & johnston s ( 2005 ) cosmologically motivated models of the stellar halo suggest that while most of the satellite accretion occurred early in the milky way s past , there may have been some recent accretion events .",
    "-band light curves of the cepheid candidates of the ( top ) p = 5.69d source , ( middle ) p = 4.923d source , and ( bottom ) p = 4.9d source [ f : sources ] ]      as in c15 , we derive the periods of the sources presented in table 1 using the lomb - scargle algorithm and retain only sources that have a significance level greater than 90-th percentile ( klein et al .",
    "2014 ) , and periods greater than three days and @xmath12 mag .",
    "we then perform a parametric bootstrap assuming a gaussian distribution of errors and at this stage only retain sources where the mean of the period distribution minus the standard deviation exceeds three days .",
    "finally , we compute the fourier parameters of the sources and visually inspect the light curves .",
    "the finding charts and @xmath6-band light curves of the three cepheid candidates that we obtained spectroscopic observations of are shown in figure 1 .",
    "our selection of cepheid candidates differs from c15 in one significant way .",
    "in addition to the criteria used by c15 , here we require that at least 90 % of the @xmath6-band vvv photometric observations are classified as `` stellar '' , i.e. have flag = -1 ( saito et al .",
    "2012 ) ; spurious variables may be identified if this flag is not required .",
    "this may be the reason why two of the sources listed in c15 ( the p = 3.42d and the p = 4.19d ) were misidentified as variables .",
    "only one of the sources in this paper was earlier presented in c15 ( the p = 5.69d source ) .",
    "our own ongoing @xmath5-band photometry confirms the variablity of the three sources in this paper on the same temporal scale as the period determined from the @xmath6-band light curves .",
    "the sources we present here have spectroscopic observations , as well as @xmath5-band photometry ( on average @xmath1 10 epochs ) , @xmath6-band light curves , and 3.6 @xmath7 fluxes .",
    "there are other cepheid candidates in this part of the sky that we were unable to obtain spectroscopic observations of ; the stars discussed in this paper do not represent a complete sample of cepheid candidates in this part of the sky .",

    "the ( small ) variability ( scowcroft et al . 2011 ) relative to the observed flux also contributes an uncertainty that is comparable to the photometric error .",
    "we calculate the uncertainty on the distance by adding in quadrature the uncertainties due to these terms .",
    "the distance error derived from the @xmath6-band for the p = 4.923d source is formally comparable to the distance itself .",
    "this source is the one that is closest to the plane , and even in the @xmath6-band , the extinction values vary significantly . for this source",

    "our ongoing @xmath5-band observations indicate that the p = 5.69d and p=4.9d sources show variability on the same scale as the period determined from @xmath6-band light curves , but at the moment we can not compute fourier parameters in the @xmath5-band due to the small number of epochs and large photometric errors .",

    "the p = 4.9d source was also observed on wifes with an effective exposure time of 4000 sec .",

    "the @xmath10-band spectra of cepheids ( and of other f stars ) show stronger brackett series lines and weaker metal lines ( meyer et al .",
    "1998 ; rayner et al . 2009 ) relative to cooler stars .",
    "in particular , the spectra of m dwarfs are distinct from the spectra of cepheids , while the spectra of cool giants have some correspondence with the spectra of hot supergiant stars .",
    "the @xmath21 of the spectra obtained on gemini s f2 of these three stars are @xmath22 respectively .",

    "the higher @xmath21 f2 spectrum also shows the 16 - 4 ( 1.556@xmath23 ) and 15 - 4 ( 1.57@xmath23 ) transitions . figure [ f : spectra ] ( b ) shows the spectra of the p = 4.923d and p = 4.9d source .",
    "the clearest lines for the p = 4.923d source are the 14 - 4 and 10 - 4 ( 1.734@xmath23 ) transitions , while for the p = 4.9d source the 10 - 4 transition appears to be visible .",
    "due to the relatively low @xmath21 of these spectra and strong telluric lines that overlap with the brackett lines ( especially in the longer half of the @xmath10-band ) , not all the brackett lines can be identified . to determine the effect of the @xmath21 on the radial velocity , we added noise and degraded the spectrum of the gcc - a cepheid and found that even at @xmath24 few , the inferred velocity remained unchanged .",
    "we use a @xmath25 fitting routine in conjunction with cross - correlation to determine the best - fit velocity and the uncertainty in the velocity .",
    "our procedure for determining radial velocities is similar to matsunaga et al .",
    "( 2015 ; henceforth m15 ) who obtained @xmath10-band spectroscopic observations of classical cepheids towards the galactic center .",
    "they have addressed two of the significant challenges in interpreting @xmath10-band spectra , namely the presence of telluric features in this part of the spectrum , and the relative lack of near - ir radial velocity templates . to address the first issue",
    ", they incorporate the telluric features in the synthetic template spectra developed by kurucz ( 1993 ) ( by multiplying the telluric spectrum with the template ) .",
    "the model spectrum is shifted by a trial redshift and compared with the target spectrum .",
    "finally , the target spectrum is assigned the redshift that minimizes the @xmath25 between the shifted model spectrum and the target spectrum .",
    "cepheid pulsations can affect the radial velocities by tens of km / s ( pejcha & kochanek 2012 ) , and we correct for the pulsation using radial velocity templates at the phase determined from the @xmath0-band light curves . we adopt the radial velocity templates used by m15 , namely the infrared photometry and radial velocities compiled by groenewegen ( 2013 ) . for delta cep , which has a period similar to the stars we consider here , the typical pulsation amplitude is @xmath1 20 km / s ( barnes et al . 1987 ) .",
    "for the synthetic spectra , we use the following parameters : @xmath26 and @xmath27 . to account for the telluric lines ,",
    "the synthetic templates incorporate the telluric lines following earlier work in m15 .",
    "we also compare to observed templates from the infrared template factory ( irtf ; rayner et al .",
    "2009 ) , as well as our own observation of gcc - a .",
    "we consider the errors in the spectrum and use a @xmath25 fitting routine in conjunction with cross - correlation to derive the uncertainties on the radial velocity ( following earlier work in bhalerao et al .",
    "2012 and the implementation in the idl routine getvel.pro ) .",
    "the heliocentric velocity that we determine for the three stars is @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , after correcting for phase using known templates for the radial velocity of cepheids ( groenewegen 2013 ; barnes et al .",
    "1987 ) , as well as comparison with our own observation of gcc - a on fire .",
    "an alternate approach is to mask regions of high sky contamination and perform a cross - correlation , which yields values that are roughly comparable .",
    "the f2 spectrum of the p = 4.9d source is quite low s / n",
    ". the wifes observation of the p = 4.9d source produced @xmath1 10 counts per pixel , and there appear to be calcium triplet lines that would correspond to the lines at 8498 @xmath31 and 8542 @xmath31 ( redshifted by @xmath1 200 km / s ) as shown in figure [ f : spectra ] ( c ) ; however , the redshifted line that would correspond to the 8662 @xmath31 line is not visible ( the latter is in a forest of emission lines ) . due to the low s / n in both the f2 and wifes observations for the p = 4.9d source ,",
    "our radial velocity measurement for this source is particularly uncertain .",
    "in this initial study , we were only able to procure spectroscopic observations of three sources .",
    "the excess of @xmath32d variables in this part of the sky found by c15 is still present when we use the criteria stated in this paper , and future work should attempt to obtain radial velocities of other cepheid candidates . in a forthcoming paper , we discuss the excess in the @xmath6 , @xmath33 cmd when we extinction correct and subtract out a background field , which is consistent with the location of red - clump stars at @xmath1 80 kpc .      the sky , the velocity from the hi map is negative ( kalberla et al . 2005 ) , and from models of the stellar disk ( e.g. besancon et al . 2003 ) is @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we conclude that , while the identification of these stars as type i cepheids may not be certain , these are halo stars , and not part of the galactic disk . interestingly , the average radial velocity is roughly consistent with the predictions from earlier dynamical models ( cb09 ) .",
    "this interaction also produces structures in the stellar disk reminiscent of the monoceros ring ( newberg et al .",
    "2002 ) , raising the question if the structures in the gas disk and the monoceros ring are connected .",
