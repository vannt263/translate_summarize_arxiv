    "solar flares are the biggest explosion in the solar system where magnetic field energy stored in the active region corona is rapidly released through magnetic reconnection process @xcite . during flares , coronal plasma",
    "is sometimes ejected out into the interplanetary space ( coronal mass ejections ; cmes ) @xcite .",
    "significant portion of active region magnetic field energy released during flares is converted to the kinetic energy of cmes @xcite . the resultant plasma and magnetic field structures detected at 1 au",
    "are called interplanetary cmes ( icmes)@xcite . when helical magnetic field of icme ejecta ( magnetic cloud ) or draped magnetic field in the interplanetary sheath ahead of magnetic cloud have strong southward component , geomagnetic storms occur @xcite .",
    "energetic protons are accelerated both at cme - driven shocks and flare site @xcite . in the case of shock acceleration mechanism ,",
    "the efficiency of particle acceleration depends on shock mach number and its normal direction , and particles are known to be most efficiently accelerated when the shocks are quasi - parallel @xcite .",
    "accelerated particles arrive at earth when earth is magnetically well connected to the shock front ( solar proton event ; spe ) .",
    "shock acceleration mechanism is generally thought to be dominant of the two , but extremely high energy protons ( with energy @xmath15 gev ) accelerated at the flare site right after the flare onset are discussed to be responsible for the prompt component of ground level enhancement ( gle ) events @xcite .",
    "large spes are often associated with large solar flares or fast cmes @xcite .",
    "the largest spe after 1970 in terms of @xmath16 10 mev proton peak flux occurred on 4 august 1972 .",
    "the estimated @xmath16 10 mev proton peak flux is higher than @xmath17 pfu ( particle flux unit ; particles sr@xmath18 @xmath19 s@xmath18 ) @xcite .",
    "modern extreme events that occurred on 23 july 2012 recorded the peak @xmath16 10 mev proton flux of @xmath20 pfu observed with stereo - a space craft when interplanetary shock wave passed the space craft @xcite .",
    "cmes and spes are the two main drivers of hazardous space weather outcomes such as potential radiation hazards for space astronauts , geomagnetic storms and telecommunication failures @xcite . on the other hand , fast cmes and intense energetic protons",
    "might have had important influence on ancient terrestrial environment through chemical processes in the terrestrial atmosphere @xcite .",
    "young stars ( like our ancient sun ) which rotate very rapidly are known to frequently produce superflares ( 10-@xmath21 times more energetic flares than the largest solar flares ever observed ) possibly due to its active dynamo .",
    "recent observation by kepler satellite revealed that some solar - type stars with rotation period longer than 10 days can also produce superflares though not very frequent @xcite .",
    "the most widely used index of solar flare magnitude is soft x - ray ( sxr ) peak flux monitored by goes satellite in 1 - 8@xmath22passband .",
    "the proportionality between hard x - ray ( hxr ) fluence and sxr peak flux of indivisual flares is known as neupert effect , and it is thought to be a casual index of released magnetic field energy during flares @xcite .",
    "the solar flares are known to follow the frequency distribution of power - law form in terms of sxr peak flux @xcite .",
    "the largest ever solar flare observed in x - ray that occurred on 4 november 2003 saturated the _ goes _ x - ray detector in 1 - 8@xmath22passband .",
    "the estimated flare class by linear extrapolation is x28 , while x - ray class estimation based on ionosphereic response resulted in x@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "evidence of a spike of carbon-14 isotope between 774 - 775 is discovered from tree rings indicative of huge solar energetic particle event driven by solar superflares @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated maximum flare energy to be of order @xmath24 erg ( flare of @xmath15x1,000 class ) based on observed maximum magnetic field strength in a sunspot and largest ar size .",
    "they estimated maximum cme speed associated with such a largest class of flares to be 7,200 km s@xmath18 assuming the cme mass to be of order @xmath25 g @xcite .",
    "there are studies on statistical relations among flare sxr peak flux observed with",
    "_ goes _ ( @xmath3 ) , cme speed near the sun ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath26 mev proton peak number flux ( @xmath1 ) from various datasets .",
    "@xmath1 is known to be correlated both with @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite . from 19 spes occurred during maximum to minimum of solar cycle 23 , @xcite reported statistical relation , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "also , the correlation coefficients of @xmath3 and @xmath2 for events during 1996 - 2007 and gle events are reported to be 0.37 and 0.50 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the correlation between @xmath3 and kinetic energy of cme ( @xmath29 with @xmath10 being cme mass estimated from coronagraph observations ) are also reported @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we analyzed the statistical relations among cme speed , peak energetic proton flux and flare sxr peak flux from a single list of events , i.e. 110 spes recorded from 1996 to 2014 whose peak proton flux in the e @xmath30 channel of goes satellite exceeded 10 pfu .",
    "we derive scaling relations among cme speed , energetic proton flux and flare sxr peak flux on the basis of simple assumptions and compared with observation .",
    "finally , we estimate how fast cmes will be , and how intense proton flux will come during possible solar superflare events based on the combination of the scaling relations and observation .",
    "a total of 143 major spes were recorded from 1996 to 2014 whose peak proton flux in the e @xmath30 channel of _ goes _ satellite exceeded 10 pfu .",
    "the events are listed in cdaw major sep event list page . for 110 out of 143 spes ,",
    "both flare sxr peak flux and cme speeds near the sun accompanied with the spes are determined with x - ray sensor on board the _ goes _ satellite and large angle and spectrometric coronagraph ( lasco ; brueckner et al .",
    "1995 ) on board the solar and heliospheric observatory ( _ soho _ ; domingo et al .",
    "1995 ) , respectively . for 80 out of these 110 spes ,",
    "the mass of accompanied cmes are also determined with lasco . the estimated speed and mass of cmes",
    "are obtained from cdaw data center cme catalog @xcite , which is also available online .",
    "we study statistical relation among @xmath3 and @xmath1 during 110 major spes recorded between 1996 and 2014 .",
    "most cmes , namely 92 out of 110 , were halo ones .",
    "a halo cme is an expanding plasma of cme that appears to form a halo of enhanced brightness completely surrounding the occulting disk when observed with a coronagraph @xcite .",
    "the estimation of speed and mass of halo cmes by coronagraph observations generally contains large uncertainty .",
    "we neglect the uncertainty of speed and mass estimation based on coronagraph observations throughout the analysis .    in figure 1 , we show correlation plot of @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "a regression line is drawn as a solid line to fit the log - log data plot .",
    "we used ordinary least squares ( ols ) bisector method for linear regressions hereafter , which is suitable for the discussion of underlying functional relation between two quantities @xcite .",
    "the correlation coefficient was @xmath31 , and the linear regression fit gives @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "5 out of 110 spes had @xmath1 larger than @xmath21 pfu , and 4 out of the five were associated with x class flares .",
    "@xmath1 also correlates with @xmath2 in our data set(figure 2 ) .",
    "we note here that throughout the paper , the cme speed @xmath2 refers to the estimated speed of cme near the sun based on observation with _",
    "the average cme speed of all the 110 events was 1566 km  s@xmath18 , and the average cme speed of 5 most intense spes was 2016 km  s@xmath18 .",
    "the correlation coefficient between @xmath1 and @xmath2 for our dataset was @xmath34 , and the linear regression result gives @xmath35 with @xmath9 .",
    "the event with @xmath36 1860 pfu and @xmath37882 km  s@xmath18 shown as unfilled circle in figure 2 seems to be an outlier , and the analysis without the event makes the correlation coefficient a little bit higher and the slope a little steeper , namely , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the event shown as unfilled circle was associated with an x7.1 class solar flare , and the cme was a halo one .",
    "figure 3 shows correlation plot between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the correlation coefficient was 0.42 , and the linear regression result gives @xmath4 with @xmath7 . in 80 spes out of 110 analyzed here ,",
    "cme mass @xmath10 is also estimated .",
    "correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath3 in the 80 spes was very poor with @xmath40 , possibly due to large uncertainty in mass estimation of halo cmes .",
    "we try to express cme mass ( @xmath10 ) , cme speed ( @xmath2 ) and energetic proton peak flux ( @xmath41 ) as a power - law form of total released energy during flares ( @xmath11 ) based on three simple physical assumptions .",
    "first , we assume the cme mass is the sum of the mass within gravitationally stratified active region ( ar ) corona , @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the density at the base of the ar corona , the length scale of flaring ar and the pressure scale hight , respectively .",
    "we implicitly assumed ar corona size @xmath45 is much larger than the coronal scale height @xmath44 , which is suitable for large ar where large flares can occur .",
    "next , we assume cme kinetic energy is proportional to the total energy released during the flare , which is also a constant fraction @xmath46 of ar magnetic field energy @xcite , @xmath47 where @xmath11 and @xmath48 are the total released energy during flares and cme kinetic energy respectively .",
    "@xmath49 is the active region magnetic field strength .",
    "typical magnetic field strength of sunspots is of the order of @xmath50 g.    the first and second assumptions ( equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ) lead to the following relations .",
    "@xmath51 @xmath52    @xcite studied cme / flare pairs observed with lasco and _ goes _ occurred from 1996 to 2006 and found the statistical relationship @xmath53 .",
    "@xcite further discussed the statistical relation of cme mass @xmath10 and energy released in the form of sxr during flares @xmath54 of the form @xmath55 , where @xmath56 in cgs units , and @xmath57 .",
    "such observations seem to be consistent with our scaling relation of @xmath12 . very interestingly , such scaling relation between @xmath10 and @xmath3",
    "obtained from solar flare statistics is consistent with mega - flare observation on young t tauri star implying the scaling relation holds in a very wide energy range , that is more than 10 orders of magnitude in flare energy @xcite .",
    "we then try to relate energetic proton peak flux @xmath1 with flare energy @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the total kinetic energy of solar energetic protons @xmath58 is proportional to flare energy , and the duration of proton flux enhancement is determined by cme propagation timescale @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60    from equation ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) we express @xmath41 as follows .",
    "@xmath61 in the derivation , we neglect the proton energy spectral variation depending on flare magnitude .    the scaling relation ( 6 )",
    "@xmath62 is plotted as a dashed line in figure 2 and compared with the observed correlation .",
    "the linear regression fit in double logarithmic space was @xmath35 with @xmath63 which has a slightly smaller slope compared to ( 6 ) .",
    "in this section , we compare the scaling relations derived above with observational statistical relations , and try to estimate how fast cme and how intense proton flux will result in the case of solar superflares .",
    "@xcite discussed that kinetic energy of cme is comparable with flare energy , namely @xmath64 .    figure 4 shows the correlation between cme kinetic energy estimated from lasco observation by @xmath65 and flare sxr peak flux @xmath3 associated with 80 major spes with cme mass estimation.the correlation coefficient was @xmath66 and the linear regression with ols bisector method results in @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "in order to estimate the upper - limit of cme speed and energetic proton flux in response to sxr class of solar flares , we try to relate @xmath2 and @xmath1 with @xmath3 by assuming @xmath3 is roughly proportional to total released energy during flares , namely @xmath69 .    based on this assumption , @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "are respectively scaled with @xmath3 as @xmath70 @xmath71    scaling relations ( 7 ) and ( 8) are shown as dashed lines in figures 3 and 1 , respectively .",
    "the dashed lines are positioned in each plots so that they pass through the upper - left - most spe , in order that we can discuss the upper limit of cme speed ( @xmath72 ) and proton flux ( @xmath73 ) in response to @xmath3 .",
    "explicit formulas are as follows , @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 km s@xmath18 , @xmath77 pfu and @xmath3 is normalized in unit of 1 w m@xmath78 .",
    "compared with linear regression fits , namely , @xmath4 and @xmath32 with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , the derived scaling relations had gentler slopes of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "we note that in figures 3 and 1 , the scaling relations ( 7 ) and ( 8) seem consistent with the line of the upper limit of observed @xmath2 and @xmath1 with respect to @xmath3 .    from equation ( 9 ) , the upper limit of @xmath2 for x10 , x100 and x1000 solar flares will be @xmath81 km  s@xmath18 , @xmath82 km  s@xmath18 and @xmath83 km  s@xmath18 , respectively ( figure 5 ( a ) ) . from equation",
    "( 10 ) , the upper limit of @xmath1 for x10 , x100 and x1000 solar flares will be @xmath84 pfu , @xmath85 pfu and @xmath86 pfu , respectively ( figure 5 ( b ) ) .",
    "in this paper we studied cme properties and energetic proton flux associated with possible superflares on the sun .",
    "the scaling relations expressing @xmath10 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 in terms of @xmath11 derived from simple assumptions are not inconsistent with statistical relations from solar observation . on the basis of the analysis above",
    ", we expect cmes associated with superflares to be fast and heavy , which will have a huge impact on space weather @xcite .",
    "huge geomagnetic storms are initiated by magnetic reconnection between injected southward magnetic field of icmes @xmath87 and earth s northward magnetic field @xcite . when icme magnetic field is northward ,",
    "no geomagnetic storms occur @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of geomagnetic storms is mainly determined by solar wind westward electric field @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is icme speed near earth@xcite .",
    "the upperlimit of the magnetic field strength of magnetic cloud @xmath90 is estimated by the balance of magnetic pressure and dynamic pressure as @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are density and speed of the solar wind near earth . if we assume typical value range of solar wind proton number density at 1 au , namely , @xmath94",
    "@xmath95 @xcite , @xmath90 is estimated as @xmath96 nt .",
    "this is consistent with observationally known fact that magnetic clouds with higher peak speed ( @xmath97 ) also possess stronger core magnetic field ( @xmath98 ) , with observational statistical relation @xmath99 nt @xcite .",
    "the upper limit of westward electric field @xmath100 is estimated as @xmath101 .",
    "cmes are decelerated during their propagation in the interplanetary space @xcite , sweeping up the interplanetary plasma on their path .",
    "we expect from conservation of momentum that if a cme ejecta is heavy enough ( comparable to or heavier than the mass scraped up on its path ) , the cme will not be decelerated much . fast and heavy icmes with southward magnetic field associated with solar superflares would cause extreme geomagnetic storms .",
    "extreme increase of radiation levels in space associated with solar superflares also result in the increase of radiation at the flight altitude and sometimes at the sea level ( ground level enhancement ; gle ) through airshower formation in earth s atmosphere .",
    "the radiation levels in earth atmosphere depend on high energy component of energetic proton flux in space .",
    "for example , gles are mainly caused by energetic protons injected to the top of the atmospheric layer whose energy is higher than @xmath102 gev .",
    "the maximum energy of energetic protons associated with solar flares are known to be less than several gev .",
    "we estimate the maximum possible energy of energetic protons accelerated at cme - driven shocks .",
    "if we apply hillas limit @xcite , we get the estimation of proton maximum energy as @xmath103 gev @xmath104 , where @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the upstream magnetic field strength in unit of 0.1 g , shock propagation speed in unit of 3000 km s@xmath18 and length scale of acceleration site in unit of the solar radius , respectively .",
    "if we assume @xmath45 is independent of flare energy , we obtain , @xmath108 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume protons with highest energies are accelerated by the electric voltage generated by magnetic reconnection at flare site , we obtain @xmath109 gev @xmath110 , where @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the active region magnetic field strength in unit of 100 g , plasma inflow speed in unit of 100 km s@xmath18 and length scale of the flaring active region in unit of 0.1 solar radius , respectively .",
    "generally , magnetic reconnection rate @xmath114 is independent of flare magnitude @xcite . applying equation ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) , we obtain @xmath115 . x1000",
    "class flare , for example , may produce 10 gev protons which result in drastic increase of radiation level in earth atmospheric layer .    in the derivation of scaling relation ( 6 ) , we assumed the relation @xmath59 , where l is the active region size .",
    "if we use constant length scale @xmath116 in place of @xmath45 , the scaling relation would change to @xmath117 .",
    "this might be the case if the particles are accelerated at the shock front in the interplanetary space where physical quantities do not depend on active region size .",
