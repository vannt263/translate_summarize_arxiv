    "<S> the suppression of high-@xmath0 particles in heavy ion collisions was one of the key discoveries at the relativistic heavy ion collider . </S>",
    "<S> this is usually parameterized by the average rate of momentum - transfer squared to this particle , @xmath1 . here </S>",
    "<S> we argue that measurements of identified particles at high @xmath0 can lead to complementary information about the medium . </S>",
    "<S> the leading particle of a jet can change its identity through interactions with the medium . </S>",
    "<S> tracing such flavor conversions could allow us to constrain the mean free path . here </S>",
    "<S> we review the basic concepts of flavor conversions and discuss applications to particle ratios and elliptic flow . </S>",
    "<S> we make a prediction that strangeness is enhanced at high @xmath0 at rhic energies while its elliptic flow is suppressed .    for the past decade </S>",
    "<S> high momentum particles and jets have been used to probe the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase created at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy loss of a fast parton suffered in the medium carries information about the typical momentum transfer @xmath2 along the path , more precisely about the transport coefficient @xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have recently argued that the mean free path @xmath4 of a fast parton could be determined separately by measuring the change in hadro - chemistry induced by the medium @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we discuss a model based on conversions of the leading particle of a jet . </S>",
    "<S> just as partons can lose energy through collisions and induced radiation , they can scatter through channels in which the identity of the fastest parton in the initial and final state are not the same . </S>",
    "<S> examples are binary collisions like @xmath5 or @xmath6 which can lead to conversions of quarks into gluons and vice versa . here </S>",
    "<S> the first parton on each side has a large momentum ( the leading jet parton ) and the second parton in the initial state is a thermal parton from the quark gluon plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of flavor conversions depends on the mean free path @xmath4 of fast partons .    </S>",
    "<S> conversions between quarks and gluons should obscure their different color factors coupling them to the medium . instead of a relative factor 9/4 in @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> only an average color factor should be observable in a long enough medium . </S>",
    "<S> it was pointed out that a larger quenching for gluons could be reflected in more suppression of protons compared to pions given the preference of gluon to proton fragmentation in modern fragmentation functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> jet conversions should soften this effect and increase the proton to pion ration in central collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] shows the ratio of nuclear modification factors @xmath7 for protons and pions with and without conversions between quarks and gluons taken into account @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , flavor conversions lead to less proton suppression .    </S>",
    "<S> conversions had also been discussed before for photons and dileptons . </S>",
    "<S> fast quarks and gluons can create real or virtual photons through compton and annihilation processes with the medium , @xmath8 , @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been realized over the years that this process can make a large contribution to the overall yield of photons or dileptons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] also shows the nuclear modification factor for direct photons with and without jet conversions into photons from the computation described in @xcite together with data from phenix .    </S>",
    "<S> most recently we predicted an enhancement of strange hadrons from jet conversions at rhic energies . </S>",
    "<S> this is driven by a strong chemical gradient between the jet sample at rhic and the quark gluon plasma . </S>",
    "<S> while strangeness is equilibrated in the latter , it contributes only a small fraction ( @xmath10 ) to the former . </S>",
    "<S> elastic channels like @xmath11 and in particular kick - out reactions like @xmath12 can lead to an enrichment of strangeness in the jet sample . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , for a sufficiently long medium the jet sample would be driven toward chemical equilibrium through interactions with the chemically equilibrated medium . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] shows the expected nuclear modification factor for neutral kaons at rhic . for the perturbative elastic rates chosen in @xcite with a @xmath13 factor of 4 we see a clear enhancement extending above 10 gev/@xmath14 .     for neutral kaons with and without conversion processes </S>",
    "<S> allowed . </S>",
    "<S> the strangeness in the jet sample is driven towards equilibrium by coupling it chemically to the quark gluon plasma.,width=264 ]    we have also checked the effect of conversions on heavy quark production @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find any significant yields of charm or bottom quarks at high @xmath0 from these processes . the same is true even at lhc energies . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that thresholds and low center of mass energies suppress pair production in interactions of jets with the medium , and kick - out reactions suffer from small heavy quark densities in the medium to begin with . even for charm at lhc </S>",
    "<S> we do not expect chemical equilibration and there is no large chemical gradient between heavy quarks in jets and the medium .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also studied the effect of flavor conversions on the azimuthal asymmetry @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> it was first pointed out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that photons from jet - medium interactions should be more abundantly produced in the direction where the medium is thicker , leading to a negative contribution to @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite for comprehensive calculations of photon elliptic flow . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to realize that this mechanism is generally true for all particles produced in jet - medium interactions @xcite . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> we expect it to hold for additional strange hadrons produced at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] shows the effect of flavor conversions on the azimuthal asymmetry @xmath15 of up , down and strange quarks as well as gluons . </S>",
    "<S> as predicted , conversions make light quarks and gluons behave similarly while there is a significant decrease in the @xmath15 of strange quarks due to the additional large yield with a negative contribution . </S>",
    "<S> note that the total @xmath15 is determined from summing up all sources of particles both with positive and negative @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] shows the resulting azimuthal asymmetry @xmath15 that we expect for kaons at rhic @xcite .    in summary , we have shown that jet conversions can lead to measurable signatures in hadron production at high @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we predict an enhancement of strange hadrons at high @xmath0 at rhic and a suppression of their azimuthal asymmetry coefficient @xmath15 . </S>"
