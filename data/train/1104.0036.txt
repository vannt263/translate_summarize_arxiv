    "horseshoes and tadpoles comprise the two classical solutions to the special case of coorbital motion in the context of the restricted three - body problem . both types of motion",
    "have been studied extensively , both analytically and numerically , partly due to their wide applicability to quasi - stable configurations in the real solar system .",
    "horseshoe - type orbits appear to be less prevalent than tadpoles , owing perhaps to their different stability properties .",
    "an often - cited example of objects horseshoeing with each other are the saturnian satellites janus and epimetheus .",
    "in addition , numerical integrations of the motion of near - earth asteroids ( neas ) 54509 yorp and 2002 aa29 show that they are currently horseshoeing with the earth @xcite .",
    "confirmation of the status of nea 2001 go2 as the third earth horseshoe will have to await further refinement of its orbit @xcite .",
    "the libration periods and lifetimes of these earth horseshoes are typically a few hundred and several thousand years respectively .    here",
    "we demonstrate the horseshoe dynamics of a newly discovered nea , 2010 so16 .",
    "we find that , in contrast to the previous cases , the lifetime of horseshoe libration between 2010 so16 and the earth is substantially higher , of order @xmath1 years .",
    "we attribute this to two factors : its low eccentricity , moderate inclination orbit and its energy state deep into the horseshoe regime .",
    "we discuss the issue of its origin and briefly comment on the possible existence of additional objects of this type .",
    ".orbital elements of 2010 so16 at jd2455400.5 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     there are currently 3 near - earth asteroids known to follow horseshoe trajectories with respect to the earth ( table  [ other ] ; also * ? ? ?",
    "of those , 2002 aa29 is the most similar to 2010 so16 , mainly due to its low eccentricity and moderate inclination .",
    "its value of @xmath2 implies a likely size of a few tens of metres .",
    "hence , it is an order of magnitude smaller than so16 .",
    "the orbital eccentricities of 54509 yorp and 2001 go2 allow close encounters with the earth .",
    "these do not necessarily eject the asteroids from the co - orbital resonance but instead they effect their transition into another mode of libration or circulation .",
    "this state is shared by other objects in so - called compound and/or transition orbits such as 3753 cruithne , the first of its class to be recognised as such @xcite .",
    "the opening angles @xmath3 of go2 and 54509 are wider than those of so16 implying an energy state deeper into the horseshoe domain",
    ". however , the contribution of their higher eccentricities in eq .  [ gc2 ] places them closer to the transition regime ( see panel ( d ) of fig  [ hlong ] ) than so16 and accounts , at least in part , for their shorter lifetimes - a few times @xmath4 yr - as horseshoe companions of the earth .",
    "the existence of this long - lived horseshoe raises the twin questions of its origin and whether objects in similar orbits are yet to be found .",
    "the object s earth - like orbit makes a direct or indirect origin in the main belt an unlikely , although not impossible , proposition @xcite .",
    "another plausible source is the earth - moon system . @xcite",
    "have suggested that 54509 may have originated within the earth - moon system .",
    "so16 s current orbit does not provide such a direct dynamical pathway to the earth - moon system as in that case , although the situation is likely to change within a timescale of several times @xmath1 yr .",
    "a third possibility is that the object originated near the asteroid - earth - sun l4 or l5 equilibrium point as a tadpole librator .",
    "@xcite showed that earth tadpoles can persist for @xmath5 yr in both high ( @xmath6 ) and low ( @xmath7 ) inclination orbits and at typical eccentricities of @xmath8 . extrapolating their results to @xmath9 yr timescales",
    ", they found it conceivable that a small fraction of a postulated initial population of earth tadpoles can survive to the present . in order for this scenario to apply to so16",
    ", it must have been a tadpole until very recently .",
    "however , the work of @xcite does not take into account the action of the yarkovsky effect , which mobilises the semimajor axes of neas at typical rates of @xmath10 au @xmath11 ( chesley et al , ast .",
    "comets met .",
    "conf . , 2008 ) . as the radial half - width of earth",
    "s tadpole region is @xmath12 au @xcite , it may be difficult for so16 to survive as a tadpole companion of the earth for more than a few times @xmath13 yr .",
    "on the other hand , a study of the stability of trojans of mars has shown that the yarkovsky acceleration does not necessarily destabilise large trojan companions of the planets @xcite and this result may also apply here . in any case ,",
    "observational determination of the asteroid s basic properties - size , spectral class and spin state - will be extremely useful in clarifying the situation .",
    "subject to the successful determination of said parameters , so16 may be a suitable test target for the direct detection of the yarkovsky acceleration as an object a few hundred metres across that makes frequent close encounters with the earth during the next decade @xcite .    finally ,",
    "regarding the possibility of existence of other bodies in similar orbits , the case for earth - based reconnaissance of the trojan regions of the earth has already been made @xcite .",
    "for relatively bright targets such as so16 , the main limiting factor is likely to be the minimum solar elongation that can be reached by an observational survey . as typical horseshoe libration periods",
    "are of order hundreds of years , completing the census of large ( @xmath14 ) terrestrial horseshoe or tadpole companions would likely require a space - based platform in a heliocentric orbit interior to the earth s .",
