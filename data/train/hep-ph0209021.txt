    "in the last years there has been a revival of interest in models where the ordinary four dimensional standard model ( sm ) arises as a low energy effective theory of models living in five or more dimensions , with the extra dimensions compactified . @xcite .",
    "such models arise naturally in string scenarios , and merit a serious study , mainly because of the plethora of theoretical and phenomenological ideas associated with them , and the flexibility they offer for realizing new , previously impossible , field - theoretic constructions .",
    "models with compact extra dimensions are in general not renormalizable , and one should regard them as low - energy manifestations of some more fundamental theory .",
    "the effects of the extra dimensions are communicated to the four dimensional world through the presence of infinite towers of kk modes , which modify qualitatively the behavior of the low - energy theory . in particular , the non - renormalizability of the theory is found when summing the infinite tower of kk states .",
    "tthe size of the extra dimensions can be surprisingly large without contradicting present experimental data ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "this opens the door to the possibility of testing these models in the near future .",
    "most importantly , the lowest kk states , if light enough , could be produced in the next generation of accelerators .",
    "@xmath5 phenomenology can provide important generic tests for new physics ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for example , the present experimental value of @xmath3 , @xmath6 is perfectly compatible with the standard model @xcite , which predicts @xmath7 .",
    "deviation due to new physics must be accomodated in this small window , a fact which furnishes non - trivial constraints on the possible models .    in the sm the most important corrections are those enhanced by the large top - quark mass in @xmath0 and @xmath8 mixing @xcite , and @xmath9 parameter . in this talk",
    "we will show that , due to this same enhancement , one may derive valuable information on the size of the extra dimension(s ) , through the study of the one - loop contributions of the kk modes to the processes @xmath10 and @xmath8 mixing @xcite .",
    "the effective @xmath11 vertex is usually parametrized as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are , respectively , the left and right chirality projectors . at one loop ,",
    "the dominant corrections amount to shifts in the coupling @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "thus , we will write @xmath17 which contains the sm tree level contribution , the sm one - loop contributions @xmath18 , and the contributions coming from new physics @xmath19 , and similarly for the right - handed couplings @xmath20 . however , in general , @xmath16 obtains sub - dominant corrections only ( not proportional to the top quark mass ) , in both the sm and new physics .",
    "the dominant sm contribution comes from the goldstone boson diagrams running in the loop ( see fig .  [ figure1 ] ) and reads @xmath21     the leading contribution in the sm case , width=188 ]    a shift in the @xmath22 couplings gives a shift in @xmath23 ( here @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 gives the shift in @xmath28 due to vertex corrections coming from new physics , @xmath29 . here",
    ", quantities with the superscript `` sm '' represent standard model quantities including complete radiative corrections .",
    "note that non - vertex corrections are universal for all quarks and cancel in the ratio @xmath3 .",
    "extra dimensions may or may not be accessible to all known fields , depending on the specifics of the underlying , more fundamental theory . here",
    "we consider the simplest generalization of the sm , the so - called 5dsm , with fermions living in four dimensions , and gauge bosons and a single scalar doublet propagating in five dimensions @xcite .",
    "the relevant pieces of the five dimensional lagrangian are ( @xmath30 are four dimensional indices and @xmath31 are five dimensional ones ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the @xmath34 higgs doublet which lives in five dimensions . @xmath35 and",
    "@xmath36 are the standard left - handed quark doublet and right - handed singlet , respectively , which live in four dimensions ( brane ) ; this is enforced by the presence of the @xmath37 .",
    "we assume that @xmath38 is compactified on an orbifold @xmath39 .",
    "fields even under the @xmath40 symmetry have zero modes and are present in the low energy theory , whereas fields that are odd have only kk modes and disappear from the low energy spectrum .",
    "one chooses the higgs doublet to be even under the aforementioned symmetry in order to have the standard higgs boson .",
    "fourier - expanding the higgs field as @xmath41 substituting in the fifth dimensional lagrangian , and integrating on the fifth component , we obtain the following four dimensional lagrangian for the kk modes @xmath42 : @xmath43 the additional factor @xmath44 comes from the normalization of the zero mode in the fourier series .    as in the sm case ,",
    "the dominant contributions to @xmath0 for large @xmath45 come from the diagram fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] where charged kk modes are running in the loop .",
    "the zero mode provides just the standard model contribution due to the exchange of the goldstone boson while the exchange of the kk modes of the charged components of the higgs doublet will give an extra contribution .",
    "since the coupling is universal summing all these contributions amounts to replacing the propagator of the goldstone boson ( in the euclidean ) @xmath46 this effective propagator reduces for small @xmath47 to the standard goldstone propagator .",
    "however , for large @xmath47 it goes as @xmath48 , which means that the ultraviolet behavior of this theory is worse than in the sm by one power of @xmath47 .",
    "even though this propagator provides a convergent result for this particular diagram , its soft high energy behaviour will trigger eventually the non - renormalizability of the theory .    adding the kk modes we obtain @xmath49 where @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the ratio of the non - standard / standard integrals .",
    "expanding for small @xmath52 we obtain @xmath53 where @xmath54 is just the derivative of the riemman zeta function .",
    "contributions from the kk towers of gauge bosons running in the loop are not enhanced by the top quark mass and are suppressed by factors @xmath55 with respect to the contribution considered .",
    "although such contributions are important for obtaining the standard model value @xcite at the required precision , they can be neglected when estimating bounds on new physics .",
    "one finds @xmath56 ; since @xmath57 is always larger than 1 , translating this result into an upper bound on @xmath58 is subtle . for this purpose",
    "we used the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite and found the 95% cl limit of @xmath59 , which , after evaluation of the integral of eq.([eq : integral ] ) , translates into an upper bound on @xmath52 , yielding @xmath60 .",
    "this amounts to a lower bound @xmath61 on the compactifications scale @xmath62 , which is comparable to those obtained from tree level processes @xcite .     the kk tower corresponding to the higgs doublet living in 5-d , width=188 ]",
    "scenarios where all sm fields live in higher dimensions have also been considered ( see for example @xcite ) ; we will refer to this type of extra dimension(s ) as `` universal '' . from the phenomenological point of view , the most characteristic feature of such theories is the conservation of the kk number at each elementary interaction vertex @xcite . as a result , and",
    "contrary to what happens in the non - universal case , the coupling of any excited ( massive ) kk mode to two zero modes is prohibited .",
    "this fact alters profoundly their production possibilities : using normal ( zero - mode ) particles as initial sates , such modes can not be resonantly produced , nor can a single kk mode appear in the final states , but must be _ pair - produced_. in addition , the conservation of the kk number leads to the appearance of heavy stable ( charged and neutral ) particles , which may pose cosmological complications ( e.g. nucleosynthesis ) @xcite ; however , one - loop effects may overcome such problems @xcite .",
    "it turns out that in the universal case the process @xmath63 furnishes a less stringent bound compared to the non - universal one @xcite .",
    "the main difference now is that in the relevant feynman graph one should sum over _ all _ particles inside the loop , fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "the end result of the calculation is a lower bound for @xmath64 of about 300 gev .",
    "the sum goes over all particle in the loop which live in 5-d , width=188 ]",
    "in the sm , the mixing between the @xmath67 meson and its anti - particle is also completely dominated by the top - quark contribution .",
    "the explicit @xmath45 dependence of the box diagrams is given by the loop function @xcite @xmath68 \\ ; , \\qquad x_{t}\\equiv \\frac{m^{2}_{t}}{m_{w}^{2}},\\ ] ] which contains the hard @xmath69 term , i.e. @xmath70 , induced by the longitudinal @xmath71 exchanges .",
    "the same function controls the top ",
    "quark contribution to the @xmath72-@xmath73 mixing parameter @xmath74 .",
    "the measured top - quark mass , @xmath75  gev , implies @xmath76 .",
    "returning to the 5dsm model considered in section 3 , the kk modes of the charged components of the doublet also contribute to the box diagram of fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] . the total dominant contribution ,",
    "sm plus kk modes , can be obtained by substituting the sm scalar propagator by the effective one of eq .",
    "( [ effprop ] ) .",
    "however , since this modified propagator behaves as @xmath77 for large @xmath78 , and therefore , the insertion of two propagators of this type turns the box diagram into uv divergent .",
    "we write the correction to @xmath79 as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is again the ratio of the non - standard to standard box integrals , i.e. @xmath82 it is clearly divergent for @xmath83 .    to evaluate @xmath84 we cut off the integral at @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is related to the scale at which new physics enters to regulate the five dimensional theory .",
    "in particular , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we obtain @xmath89 for moderate values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 the new physics correction is only about @xmath92 . for more extreme values ( for instance @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) ,",
    "the corresponding contribution to @xmath81 is about @xmath95 .",
    "notice also that the presence of diagrams with gauge boson kk modes could modify the bounds on @xmath4 by a factor of about 20% . however , given the uncertainty in the calculation of the box diagrams due to the dependence on the scale @xmath96 estimating such effects seems superfluous",
    ". the important point , however , is that the contribution from extra dimensions to the function @xmath79 is always positive .",
    "we can use the measured @xmath97-@xmath98 mixing to infer the experimental value of @xmath79 and set a limit on @xmath99 . the explicit dependence on the quark ",
    "mixing parameters can be resolved by combining the constraints from @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in ref .",
    "@xcite a complete analysis of the allowed values for @xmath79 was performed by varying all parameters in their allowed regions .",
    "the final outcome of such an analysis is that @xmath79 could take values within a rather large interval , namely @xmath103 .",
    "since most of the errors come from uncertainties in theoretical calculations , it is rather difficult to assign confidence levels to the bounds quoted above .",
    "the lower limit is very stable under changes of parameters , while the upper limit could be modified by a factor of 2 by simply doubling some of the errors .    given that the standard model value for @xmath79 is @xmath104 , _ positive _ contributions can be comfortably accommodated , whereas negative contributions are more constrained .",
    "as we have seen , extra dimensions result in _ positive _ contributions to @xmath79 ; in fact one can obtain values that could approach the upper limit of @xmath79 only for rather small values of the compactification scale @xmath4 and large values of the scale of new physics , @xmath105 .",
    "it seems therefore that , at present , the above bounds do not provide good limits on @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "if future experiments combined with theoretical improvements were to furnish a value for @xmath79 exceeding that of the sm , our analysis shows that such a discrepancy could easily be accommodated in models with large extra dimensions .    in conclusions",
    ", we have seen that the existing results from the processes @xmath10 and @xmath8 mixing can furnish valuable lower bounds on the size of the possible extra dimenions .",
    "these bonds are model - dependent , varying between 0.3 gev to 1 tev , a fact which corroborates the expectation that the corresponding kk states should be well within the reach of the lhc .",
