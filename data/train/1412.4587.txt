    "the present work deals with the generalized surface quasi - geostrophic equation ( gsqg ) arising in fluid dynamics and which describes the evolution of the potential temperature @xmath1 by the transport equation :    @xmath2    here @xmath3 refers to the velocity field , @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a real parameter taken in @xmath60,2[$ ] .",
    "the singular operator @xmath7 is of convolution type and defined by , @xmath8 with @xmath9 where @xmath10 stands for the gamma function .",
    "this model was proposed by crdoba et al . in @xcite as an interpolation between euler equations and the surface quasi - geostrophic model ( sqg ) corresponding to @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the sqg equation was used by juckes @xcite and held et al .",
    "@xcite to describe the atmosphere circulation near the tropopause .",
    "it was also used by lapeyre and klein @xcite to track the ocean dynamics in the upper layers .",
    "we note that there is a strong mathematical and physical analogy with the three - dimensional incompressible euler equations ; see @xcite for details .    in the last few years",
    "there has been a growing interest in the mathematical study of these active scalar equations .",
    "special attention has been paid to the local well - posedness of classical solutions which can be performed in various functional spaces .",
    "for instance , this was implemented in the framework of sobolev spaces @xcite by using the commutator theory .",
    "wether or not these solutions are global in time is an open problem except for euler equations @xmath11 .",
    "the second restriction with the gsqg equation concerns the construction of yudovich solutions  known to exist globally in time for euler equations @xcite  which are not at all clear even locally in time .",
    "the main difficulty is due to the velocity which is in general singular and scales below the lipschitz class .",
    "nonetheless one can say more about this issue for some special class of concentrated vortices .",
    "more precisely , when the initial datum has a vortex patch structure , that is , @xmath13 is the characteristic function of a bounded simply connected smooth domain @xmath14 , then there is a unique local solution in the patch form @xmath15 in this case , the boundary motion of the domain @xmath16 is described by the contour dynamics formulation ; see the papers @xcite .",
    "the global persistence of the boundary regularity is only known for @xmath11 according to chemin s result @xcite ; for another proof see the paper of bertozzi and constantin @xcite .",
    "notice that for @xmath17 the numerical experiments carried out in @xcite provide strong evidence for the singularity formation in finite time .",
    "let us mention that the contour dynamics equation remains locally well - posed when the domain of the initial patch is assumed to be multi - connected meaning that the boundary is composed with finite number of disjoint smooth jordan curves .",
    "the main concern of this work is to explore analytically and numerically some special vortex patches called v - states ; they correspond to patches which do not change their shapes during the motion .",
    "the emphasis will be put on the v - states subject to uniform rotation around their center of mass , that is , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 stands for the planar rotation with center @xmath20 and angle @xmath21 the parameter @xmath22 is called the angular velocity of the rotating domain . along the chapter",
    "we call these structures rotating patches or simply v - states .",
    "their existence is of great interest for at least two reasons : first they provide non trivial initial data with global existence , and second this might explain the emergence of some ordered structures in the geophysical flows . this study has been conducted first for the two - dimensional euler equations ( @xmath11 ) a long time ago and a number of analytical and numerical studies are known in the literature . the first result in this setting goes back to kirchhoff @xcite who discovered that an ellipse of semi - axes @xmath23 and @xmath24 rotates uniformly with the angular velocity @xmath25 ; see for instance the references and @xcite . till",
    "now this is the only known explicit v - states ; however the existence of implicit examples was established about one century later .",
    "in fact , deem and zabusky @xcite gave numerical evidence of the existence of the v - states with @xmath26-fold symmetry for each integer @xmath27 ; remark that the case @xmath28 coincides with kirchhoff s ellipses .",
    "to fix the terminology , a planar domain is said @xmath26-fold symmetric if it has the same group invariance of a regular polygon with @xmath26 sides .",
    "note that at each frequency @xmath26 these v - states can be seen as a continuous deformation of the disc with respect to to the angular velocity .",
    "an analytical proof of this fact was given few years later by burbea in @xcite .",
    "his approach consists in writing a stationary problem in the frame of the patch with the conformal mapping of the domain and to look for the non trivial solutions by using the technique of the bifurcation theory .",
    "quite recently , in burbea s approach was revisited with more details and explanations .",
    "the boundary regularity of the v - states was also studied and it was shown to be of class @xmath29 and convex close to the disc .",
    "we mention that explicit vortex solutions similar to the ellipses are discovered in the literature for the incompressible euler equations in the presence of an external shear flow ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "a general review about vortex dynamics can be found in the    with regard to the existence of the simply connected v - states for the ( gsqg ) it has been discussed very recently in the papers @xcite . in @xcite , it was shown that the ellipses can not rotate for any @xmath30 and to the authors best knowledge no explicit example is known in the literature . lately , in @xcite the last two authors proved the analogous of burbea s result and showed the existence of the @xmath26-folds rotating patches for @xmath310,1[$ ] .",
    "in addition , the bifurcation from the unit disc occurs at the angular velocities , @xmath32 where @xmath10 denotes the usual gamma function.the remaining case @xmath33 has been explored and solved by castro , crdoba and gmez - serrano in @xcite .",
    "they also show that the v - states are @xmath29 and convex close to the discs . to complete these works we discussed in this work ( which is forwarded in ) some numerical experiments concerning these v - states and their limiting structures when we go to the end of each branch ; new behaviors",
    "will be observed compared to the numerical experiments achieved for euler    we want in this chapter to learn more about the v - states but with different topological structure compared to the preceding discussion .",
    "more precisely , we propose to scrutinize rotating patches with only one hole , also called doubly connected v - states .",
    "recall that a patch @xmath34 is said to be doubly connected if the domain @xmath35 , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 being two simply connected bounded domains satisfying @xmath38 this structure is preserved for euler system globally in time but known to be for short time when @xmath00,1[$ ] see @xcite .",
    "we notice that compared to the simply connected case the boundaries evolve through extra nonlinear terms coming from the interaction between the boundaries and therefore the existence of the v - states is relatively more complicate to analyze .",
    "this problem is not well studied from the analytical point of view and recent progress has been made for euler equations in the papers @xcite . in @xcite , the authers proved the existence of explicit v - states similar to kirchhoff ellipses seems to be out of reach .",
    "indeed , it was stated that if one of the boundaries of the v - state is a circle then necessarily the other one should be also a circle . moreover ,",
    "if the inner curve is an ellipse then there is no rotation at all .",
    "another closely related subject is to deal with some vortex magnitude @xmath39 inside the domain @xmath37 and try to find explicit rotating patches .",
    "this was done by flierl and polvani @xcite who proved that confocal ellipses rotate uniformly provided some compatibility relations are satisfied between the parameter @xmath39 and the semi - axes of the ellipses .",
    "we note that another approach based upon complex analysis tools with a complete discussion can be found    now , from the equations we may easily conclude that the annulus is a stationary doubly connected patch , and therefore it rotates with any angular velocity @xmath22 . from this obvious fact",
    ", one can wonder wether or not the bifurcation to nontrivial v - states still happens as for the simply connected case .",
    "this has been recently investigated in @xcite for euler equations following basically burbea s approach but with more involved calculations . it was shown that for @xmath40 and @xmath26 being an integer satisfying the inequality @xmath41 then there exist two curves of non - annular @xmath26-fold doubly connected patches bifurcating from the annulus @xmath42 at different eigenvalues @xmath43 given explicitly by the formula @xmath44 ^ 2-b^{2m}}.\\ ] ] now we come to the main contribution of the current work .",
    "we propose to study the doubly connected v - states for the gsqg model when @xmath00,1[$ ] . before stating our result we need to make some notation .",
    "we define @xmath45 and @xmath46 where @xmath47 refers to bessel function of the first kind .",
    "our result reads as follows .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath48 and @xmath490,1[$ ] ; there exists @xmath50 with the following property : + for each @xmath51 there exists two curves of @xmath26-fold doubly connected @xmath52-states that bifurcate from the annulus @xmath53 at the angular velocities @xmath54 with @xmath55 ^ 2 - 4b^2\\lambda_{m}^2(b).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ rmw1 ]    1 .",
    "the number @xmath56 is the smallest integer such that @xmath57 this restriction appears in the spectral study of the linearized operator and gives only sufficient condition for the existence of the v - states .",
    "2 .   as we shall see later in lemma [ lem1 ] , for @xmath11 we find the result of euler equations established in @xcite and the condition @xmath58 is in accordance with that given by @xmath59 3 .",
    "we can check by using the strict monotonicity of @xmath60 that for any @xmath61 @xmath62 consequently the corresponding bifurcating curves generate close to the annulus non trivial clockwise doubly connected v - states .",
    "this fact is completely new compared to what we know for euler equations or for the simply connected case where the bifurcation occurs at positive angular velocities .",
    "the numerical experiments discussed in section @xmath63 reveal the existence of non radial stationary patches for the generalized quasi - geostrophic equations and it would be very interesting to establish this fact analytically . in a connected subject , we point out that the last author has shown quite recently in @xcite that for euler equations clockwise convex v - states reduce to the discs .",
    "now we shall sketch the proof of theorem [ main ] which is mainly based upon the bifurcation theory via crandall - rabinowitz s theorem . the first step is to write down the analytical equations of the boundaries of the v - states .",
    "this can be done for example through the conformal parametrization of the domains @xmath36 and @xmath37 : we denote by @xmath64 the conformal mappings possessing the following structure , @xmath65 we assume in addition that the fourier coefficients are real which means that we look only for the v - states which are symmetric with respect to the real axis . moreover using the subordination principle",
    "we deduce that @xmath660,1[$ ] ; the parameter @xmath24 coincides with the small radius of the annulus that we slightly perturb . as we shall see later in section [ sec12 ] ,",
    "the conformal mappings are subject to two coupled nonlinear equations defined as follows : for @xmath67 @xmath68 with @xmath69 in order to apply the bifurcation theory we should understand the structure of the linearized operator around the trivial solution @xmath70 , corresponding to the annulus with radii @xmath24 and @xmath71 , and identify the range of @xmath72 where this operator has a one - dimensional kernel .",
    "the computations of the linear operator @xmath73 with @xmath74 in terms of its fourier coefficients are long and tricky .",
    "they are connected to the hypergeometric functions @xmath75 simply denoted by @xmath76 throughout this chapter . to find compact formula we use at several steps some algebraic identities described by the contiguous function relations - .",
    "similarly to the euler equations @xcite the linearized operator acts as a matrix fourier multiplier .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath77 we obtain the formula , @xmath78 where the matrix @xmath79 is given for @xmath80 by @xmath81 therefore the values of @xmath22 associated to non trivial kernels are the solutions of a second - degree polynomial , @xmath82 this can be solved when the discriminant @xmath83 introduced in theorem [ main ] is positive .",
    "the computations of the dimension of the kernel are more complicate than the cases raised before in the references @xcite .",
    "the matter reduces to count the following discrete set @xmath84 note that in @xcite this set has only one element and therefore the kernel is one - dimensional .",
    "this follows from the monotonicity of the `` nonlinear eigenvalues '' sequence @xmath85 which is not very hard to get due to the explicit polynomial structure of the coefficients of the analogous polynomial to .",
    "unfortunately , in the current situation this structure is broken because the matrix coefficients of @xmath86 are related to bessel functions .",
    "therefore the monotonicity of the eigenvalues is more subtle and will require more refined analysis .",
    "this subject will be discussed later with ample details in the subsection [ subsec12 ] . to achieve the spectral study and check the complete assumptions of crandall - rabinowitz s theorem it remains to prove the transversality assumption and check that the image is of co - dimension one .",
    "this will be done in section [ sec45 ] in a straightforward way and without serious difficulties .",
    "we also mention that the transversality assumption is obtained only when the discriminant @xmath87 meaning that there is no crossing roots for the equation .",
    "the proof of the bifurcation will be achieved in section [ sec45 ] .",
    "next , we shall make few comments about the statement of the main theorem .",
    "@xmath88 for the sqg equation corresponding to @xmath12 the situation is more delicate due to some logarithmic loss . the simply connected case has been achieved recently in @xcite by using hilbert spaces where we take into account this loss .",
    "the same approach could lead to the existence of the doubly - connected v - states for the ( sqg ) equation .",
    "for the spectral study , the linearized operator can be obtained as a limit of when @xmath5 goes to @xmath89 more precisely , we get    @xmath90    where the matrix @xmath79 is given for @xmath80 by @xmath91 with @xmath92    @xmath93 the boundary of the v - states belongs to hlder space @xmath94 . for euler equations corresponding to @xmath11 ,",
    "we get better result in the simply connected geometry as it was shown the boundary is @xmath29 and convex when the v - states are close to the circle .",
    "the proof in this particular case uses in a deep way the algebraic structure of the kernel according to some recurrence formulae .",
    "the extension of this result to @xmath00,2[$ ] was done in @xcite .",
    "we expect that the latter approach could be also adapted to the model for the doubly connected case .",
    "@xmath95 in the setting of the vortex patches the global existence with smooth boundaries is not known for @xmath310,2[$ ] .",
    "the simply connected v - states discussed in @xcite offer a first class of global solutions which are periodic in time .",
    "we find here a second class of global solutions which are the doubly connected v - states .",
    "the remainder of the chapter is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we shall write down the boundary equations through the conformal parametrization . in",
    "we shall introduce and review some background material on the bifurcation theory and gauss hypergeometric functions . in section @xmath96 , we will study the regularity of the nonlinear functionals involved in the boundary equations . in section",

    "in fact , especially for @xmath907 , incipient hooks are clearly visible .",

    "it is possible to still continue the bifurcation curve , although the results are to be taken with prudence , because higher spatial resolution is needed .",

    "as we have seen , the procedure to find doubly - connected @xmath26-fold @xmath52-states is very similar in the vortex patch and in the quasi - geostrophic problems .",

    "indeed , unlike in the vortex patch problem , where we had just two parameters @xmath24 and @xmath22 , we have now a third parameter @xmath5 .",

    "the hypergeometric function @xmath599 is commonly implemented in most scientific packages ; for instance , in matlab , @xmath997 can be evaluated by means of the command ` hypergeom([a , b ] , c , z ) ` , so we can find the only value @xmath994 satisfying efficiently and with the greatest possible accuracy , by means a simple bisection technique . in figure",
    "[ f : alphab0 ] , we have plotted @xmath994 against 200 different values of @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath998 , and @xmath999 . observe that @xmath994 tends very quickly to @xmath71 ; for example , @xmath1000 . on the other hand , @xmath1001 , which is coherent with the vortex patch problem , where there is no lower bound for @xmath24 .",
    "however , we have discovered in our numerical experiments that is not sharp .",
    "indeed , we have been able to find @xmath52-states with @xmath24 much smaller than @xmath994 . in all the numerical experiments in this section ,",
    "we take @xmath1002 nodes . in figure [ f : vstate1holealpha0_9b0_2omegas ] , we have plotted @xmath52-states corresponding to @xmath907 and @xmath1003 , where @xmath1004 . on the left - hand side ,",
    "we have started to bifurcate from @xmath1005 .",
    "observe that @xmath967 is practically a circumference , for all @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath52-state corresponding to @xmath1006 , in black , is practically a circular annulus , whereas the outer boundary of the @xmath52-state corresponding to @xmath1007 , in red , has a marked star shape . for @xmath22",
    "slightly smaller than @xmath1007 , the numerical experiments become instable . on the right - hand side , we have started to bifurcate from @xmath1008 .",
    "the most remarkable fact is that @xmath22 is always negative , i.e , the @xmath52-states rotate clockwise , which is an important difference with respect to the vortex patch problem . on the other hand , @xmath966 is practically a circumference , for all @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath52-state corresponding to @xmath1009 , in black , is practically a circular annulus , whereas the inner boundary of the @xmath52-state corresponding to @xmath1010 , in red , has a marked star shape .",

    "figure [ f : vstate1holealpha0_9b0_2omegas ] shows the obvious parallelism with @xcite in the vortex patch problem : as @xmath24 becomes smaller , bifurcating at @xmath1011 yields doubly - connected @xmath52-states closer and closer to simply - connected @xmath52-states ; whereas , bifurcating at @xmath1012 yields double - connected @xmath52-states closer and closer to the unit circumference .",
    "this explains why there are two bifurcation values of @xmath22 in the doubly - connected case , and just one single bifurcation value of @xmath22 in the simply - connected case . nonetheless ,",
    "unlike what would have happened in the vortex patch problem , the @xmath52-states corresponding to @xmath1007 and to @xmath1010 seem to have developed no singularity .",
    "again , as in the simply - connected case , the explanation is given by the loss of monotonicity in the bifurcation curves of @xmath1013 and @xmath1014 in with respect to @xmath22 , plotted in figure [ f : bifurcation1hole ] , which predicts the existence of saddle - node bifurcation points .",
    "observe also that , when we bifurcate from @xmath1015 , @xmath1013 clearly dominates ; whereas , when we bifurcate from @xmath1016 , @xmath1017 dominates and @xmath1013 is of the order of @xmath1018 .",
    "this confirms our previous observations .       following the procedure explained in the simply - connected case ( where we set @xmath928 , @xmath1019^{1/2}$ ] , and so on ) ,",
    "we have continued the bifurcation curves at @xmath1020 , and @xmath1021 , until @xmath1022 and @xmath1023 , respectively , as is shown in figure [ f : bifurcation1holeupdated ] .",
    "it is still possible to go a bit further , but , in order not to lose accuracy , a larger number of nodes is convenient .",
    "the pieces of curve beyond the saddle - node bifurcation points are shown in thicker stroke .       in figure",

    "are evident .",
    "it would be interested to calculate which kind of limiting @xmath52-states develops .",
    "finally , whether the lower bound restriction for @xmath24 can be ignored completely or not is another relevant question .",
    "another relevant fact is the possibility to find examples where @xmath52-states exist for all @xmath1025 $ ] ; such situation was also found in the vortex patch problem .",
    "we have considered , for instance , @xmath1026 , @xmath893 , and @xmath1027 , with @xmath1028 and @xmath1029 .",
    "observe that @xmath1030 , so we are violating the restriction on @xmath994 again .",

    "let us finish this section by mentioning the existence of stationary doubly - connected @xmath52-states when @xmath904 , i.e. , @xmath52-states with @xmath1035 .",
    "like the examples with @xmath1036 shown above , they have no particularity from a numerical point of view , yet they are a completely new phenomenon with respect to the vortex patch problem . to obtain them ,",
