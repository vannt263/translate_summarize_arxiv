    "collisions of nuclei at high energies at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and , soon , at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) create a fireball with local energy densities well above 1 gev/@xmath3 . at those densities ,",
    "quarks and gluons form a deconfined quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "in some of the collisions , high momentum partons in the initial nuclear wave functions scatter off each other and propagate away from the collision axis .",
    "they form large momentum jets in the final state .",
    "these jets , and the hadrons fragmenting from them , can be used as hard probes of the fireball .",
    "the interactions of the scattered partons with quark gluon plasma lead to radiative energy loss and a significant suppression of the hadron yield at high transverse momentum @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "one of the key results from rhic was the confirmation of this jet quenching effect : hadrons with @xmath5 gev/@xmath6 are suppressed by about a factor 5 .",
    "in addition , an extinction of away - side jet correlations has been seen in a certain kinematic regime , further emphasizing the large opacity of quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "the study of quark gluon plasma has now moved into an era of quantitative assessments of experimental results .",
    "a simple question that we should be able to answer is that of an averaged value @xmath7 of the transport coefficient @xmath8 , the average squared momentum transfer @xmath9 of a high momentum parton per mean - free path @xmath10 .",
    "the averaging @xmath11 here refers to the many possible paths of a parton ( thus sampling different local @xmath1 along the trajectory in a cooling and expanding fireball ) , an average over parton species ( until we have means to reliably distinguish gluon and quark jets ) , and the average over many event geometries for a given centrality bin ( hard processes at rhic are rare and experimental results are event averaged ) .",
    "comparative studies using the mainstream energy loss models lead to a somewhat unsettled picture .",
    "bass et al .",
    "@xcite have reported a wide range of possible values for @xmath12 , the local initial value of @xmath1 at the center of a central collision , ranging from 2.3 gev@xmath13/fm to 18.5 gev@xmath13/fm depending on the energy loss model , and on how the local @xmath14 is modeled as a function of the local energy density or temperature at position @xmath15 and time @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , we have been cautioned by results that show that @xmath1 extracted from single and di - hadron nuclear suppression factors are not necessarily compatible , and that @xmath1 is sensitive to assumptions on pre - equilibrium quenching and the initial parton spectrum @xcite as well as radiative corrections to the hard process @xcite .",
    "clearly we have to discuss and constrain uncertainties in our modeling of jet quenching very carefully in order to arrive at reliable quantitative estimates . in this work",
    "we investigate the influence of inhomogeneities and fluctuations in the fireball on jet quenching observables .",
    "as mentioned above , experimental data are averages of observables over many events , where in each event jets are created and propagate through the underlying fireball .",
    "most calculations found in the literature on the other hand turn this process around and propagate jets through an idealized fireball which can be understood as an average over realistic fireballs .",
    "these smooth fireballs come in various degrees of sophistication , from a simple overlap of nuclear thickness functions in the transverse plane to the use of detailed maps from hydrodynamics calculations that take into account the proper expansion and cooling .",
    "however , even the latter are often based on averaged and hence idealized initial conditions .",
    "it has been realized before that event - by - event computations are crucial to understand some low-@xmath4 observables , e.g.  hydrodynamic elliptic flow @xcite .",
    "it is important to take into account that the overlap of two nuclei ( i ) is irregularly shaped , ( ii ) is generally not aligned with the naive geometrical reaction plane , and ( iii ) exhibits local fluctuations with hot spots and cooler regions .",
    "this leads to appreciable differences compared to computations using averaged , idealized fireballs .    here",
    "we investigate whether an event - by - event computation of jet quenching differs from one using an averaged event .",
    "if the answer is yes , an interesting question arises : is it possible to study some features of the spatial structure of fireballs with hard probes , despite the averaging over events ?",
    "in other words , is a true tomography feasible ?",
    "let us discuss some general expectations when we go from parton propagation through an averaged fireball to an average over propagation in many fireballs .",
    "first consider the limit of extreme quenching , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the typical size of the fireball and @xmath19 the momentum of the final state parton .",
    "all observed particles then come from the surface of the fireball .",
    "it is clear that we should expect more such particles from an inhomogeneous fireball compared to a smooth fireball with equal total energy , if @xmath1 is a fixed function of the fireball density .",
    "this is due to the larger effective surface area of an inhomogeneous fireball , see e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fig : events ] . hence the single and double particle nuclear modification factors",
    ", @xmath20 should increase for partons , and for hadrons fragmenting from them .",
    "we also expect the azimuthal anisotropy @xmath21 i.e.  the difference of parton emission out of the reaction plane and into the reaction plane , to decrease since the relative increase in surface should be larger on the out - of - plane side",
    ". please note that the number of collisions @xmath22 in the denominator is an averaged number estimated for the corresponding centrality bin .",
    "we will follow this procedure and will not divide by the number of collisions on an event - by - event basis . for completeness",
    "let us also give the definition for the nuclear modification factor of the two - particle correlation per trigger @xmath23 which we will use later .",
    "let us consider a more quantitative example .",
    "imagine energy loss @xmath24 along a parton trajectory determined by an expression of the general type @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the point of creation and the emission angle of the parton , @xmath28 the unit vector along the trajectory , and @xmath16 the time elapsed since creation of the parton .",
    "@xmath29 encodes the path - length dependence with linear or quadratic dependence corresponding to @xmath30 or @xmath31 resp . , and @xmath32 is a coefficient . @xmath33 encodes a local property of the fireball , akin to a density , which we do not specify further at this point .",
    "let @xmath34 be the probability for a parton to emerge from point @xmath26 .",
    "the relevant quantity to study is the energy loss weighted with the emission probability , @xmath35 .",
    "this quantity characterizes the suppression of single particle spectra for not too large quenching ( @xmath36 ) as we can infer from the following exercise for a power - law parton spectrum @xmath37 . expanding the expression @xmath38 in the final parton spectrum for small energy loss",
    "we can express the final spectrum as @xmath39 the energy loss model here is deterministic , but we do not expect major modifications of the following arguments if @xmath40 only gives an average value of a statistical process of scattering and gluon emission .",
    "now we consider the pair of densities @xmath41 , @xmath42 event - by - event by writing them as a sum of ensemble expectation values @xmath43 , @xmath44 and fluctuations @xmath45 , @xmath46 , resp .",
    "the ensemble average of the single particle suppression is given by @xmath47 the first term is the result from propagating through the averaged fireball , and we have omitted terms linear in fluctuations due to @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the last term contains the correction due to fluctuations @xmath50 we have introduced the correlation function @xmath51 between fluctuations of the position of hard collisions and the density of the bulk fireball .",
    "( [ eq : dnh ] ) is a rather general statement one can make about event - by - event fluctuations without imposing too many restrictions on the energy loss mechanism .",
    "our result indicates that the leading deviation due to fluctuations is given by correlations between the emission point of the jet and the fireball along its trajectory .     as a function of @xmath16 along two cuts extending radially from the point @xmath52 , 4 fm away from the reaction plane , in @xmath53 ( @xmath54 , solid line ) and @xmath55 direction ( @xmath56 , dashed line ) resp . ;",
    "calculated from 10,000 glissando au+au events with an average impact parameter @xmath57 fm . ]",
    "what constraints can be put on @xmath18 ?",
    "we expect fluctuations to be granular with a certain length scale @xmath58 ( e.g.  the nucleon diameter if @xmath59 is related to the density of nucleon - nucleon collisions and @xmath60 to the density of participant nucleons )",
    ". then @xmath18 must be positive for @xmath61 because on average the density of hard processes and the density of the soft , `` underlying '' event should be positively correlated . on the other hand , @xmath18 will turn negative on distance scales larger than @xmath58 because the total amount of matter in the transverse plane is conserved on average . in other words ,",
    "a hot spot of the fireball has to be compensated , on average , by less material around that spot .",
    "this is also the reason for the argument of a larger effective surface that we raised for the case of surface - dominated emission : clumping of density somewhere along the boundary of the fireball introduces `` holes '' elsewhere . in principle",
    "@xmath60 also carries an explicit dependence on the time @xmath16 elapsed  suppressed in the notation  since the fireball is evolving dynamically .",
    "we expect that relaxation phenomena or hydrodynamic evolution wash out the correlation function @xmath18 , although this might take several fm/@xmath6 by which time a large fraction of the observable jet strength has left the fireball .",
    "we check our qualitative expectations with an example shown in fig.[fig : rr ] .",
    "we provide two cuts through the correlation function of the densities of binary collisions , @xmath62 , calculated from the initial state simulation glissando @xcite .",
    "we discuss more details about glissando in the next section .",
    "we clearly see positive correlations with a radius @xmath63 fm as expected from fluctuations based on collisions of nucleons .",
    "the anti - correlation region extends all the way to the point where the nuclear overlap zone ends .    for the following it",
    "is useful to look at a simplistic parametrization for the correlation function @xmath18 which should be qualitatively true for a wide class of models .",
    "let us assume a non - spherical fireball with short and long axes @xmath64 and @xmath65 , resp . in a fluctuating fireball",
    "these are only expectation values , of course .",
    "let us further assume @xmath66 where @xmath67 and we neglect the dependence of @xmath18 on the center coordinate @xmath68 which should be a satisfying approximation for fireballs which are _ on average _ uniform ( i.e. @xmath69 and @xmath70 are smooth ) and large , ( i.e.  @xmath64 , @xmath71 ) .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath72 are positive numbers that characterize the correlation strength on distance scales @xmath58 and the anti - correlation strength on larger distances , resp .",
    "we note that @xmath18 should go to zero if the relative distance becomes too large which is not duly captured in the ansatz above .",
    "however this should not change the following interesting result on elliptic flow .",
    "first we note that @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the length of the parton trajectory in the fireball .",
    "we clearly see that the sign of the correction is determined by the competition between an increased suppression coming from more jets being emitted in regions with a denser fireball , and the decreased suppression around those regions .    while it is hard to predict the sign of @xmath75 even after integration over emission points @xmath26 without any further concrete assumptions we can make the following observation .",
    "let us use the difference of energy loss in- and out - of - plane as a proxy for @xmath2 . to be more precise",
    ", @xmath2 should be a monotonously rising function of @xmath76 under the assumptions made here the correction to this asymmetry due to fluctuations is @xmath77 for reasonable @xmath29 since @xmath78 .",
    "hence , the azimuthal anisotropy @xmath2 tends to be diminished in event - by - event calculations for a broad variety of energy loss models .",
    "basically there is more room for the anti - correlation in @xmath18 to decrease energy loss along the longer side of the fireball than along the narrow side .",
    "this is compatible with the argument we made in the case of extremely strong quenching and surface dominated emission , and it can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rr ] .",

    "in other words we are only sensitive to the time evolution of @xmath85 .",
    "however we can argue that the longitudinal expansion of the fireball will not change the transverse correlation function @xmath18 except for an overall scaling factor , and transverse expansion is building up from zero at early times , being not overly relevant for most measured jets .",

    "this residual signal of inhomogeneities can in principle be used for a true tomography which can measure the degree of initial fragmentation in the fireball .",

    "<S> high momentum jets and hadrons can be used as probes for the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) formed in nuclear collisions at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the influence of fluctuations in the fireball on jet quenching observables by comparing propagation of light quarks and gluons through averaged , smooth qgp fireballs with event - by - event jet quenching using realistic inhomogeneous fireballs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the transverse momentum and impact parameter dependence of the nuclear modification factor @xmath0 can be fit well in an event - by - event quenching scenario within experimental errors . </S>",
    "<S> however the transport coefficient @xmath1 extracted from fits to the measured nuclear modification factor @xmath0 in averaged fireballs underestimates the value from event - by - event calculations by up to 50% . on the other hand , after adjusting @xmath1 to fit @xmath0 in the event - by - event analysis we find residual deviations in the azimuthal asymmetry @xmath2 and in two - particle correlations , that provide a possible faint signature for a spatial tomography of the fireball . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss a correlation function that is a measure for spatial inhomogeneities in a collision and can be constrained from data . </S>"
