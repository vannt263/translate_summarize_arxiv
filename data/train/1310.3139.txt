    "production of charmonia , bound state of @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks , is an intense research activity , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the peculiar properties of some of the charmonium states , like their small size ( @xmath5 fm ) and strong binding energy ( several hundred mev ) , make them ideal probes of the strongly interacting deconfined matter , the so - called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , formed in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "alice ( a large ion collider experiment ) @xcite was designed to study heavy - ion collisions and the properties of the qgp .",
    "one of the signatures of the qgp formation is the so - called @xmath0  `` melting '' @xcite that results in a suppression of the @xmath0  in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the @xmath0  suppression can be quantified in terms of the nuclear modification factor : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the invariant yield of the @xmath0  measured in nucleus - nucleus ( a - a ) collisions , @xmath8 is the nuclear thickness function , @xmath9 is the @xmath0  cross - section in pp collisions at the same energy . if @xmath10 differs from unity nucleus - nucleus collisions can not be considered as a simple superposition of elementary nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "alice measured @xmath11 in pb - pb collisions at @xmath1  = 2.76 tev @xcite . the @xmath0  suppression observed in this measurement",
    "was well described in terms of hot nuclear matter effects ( related to qgp formation ) .",
    "however other effects , related to cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) are expected to play a role .",
    "they can be divided into three main groups :    * * initial state effects . *",
    "gluon shadowing @xcite ( or gluon saturation @xcite ) is an effect of depletion of low - momentum gluons in nuclei compared to protons .",
    "it is currently poorly constrained by data at lhc energy .",
    "* * nuclear absorption . * a @xmath0  , or a pre - resonant @xmath12 pair can be dissociated by interacting with cold nuclear matter @xcite . at the lhc , due to the large lorentz boost of the colliding nuclei at mid and forward rapidity in p-pb collisions",
    "the @xmath12 pair spends a very short time within cold nuclear matter . therefore such effect ( also known as nuclear absorption )",
    "is expected to be negligible . *",
    "* coherent parton energy loss @xcite .",
    "* it is related to the medium - induced radiative loss by the initial ( partons ) or final ( @xmath12 pair ) state .    to investigate the role of cnm effects and disentangle them from the hot nuclear matter effects in pb - pb collisions ,",
    "p - pb collisions were studied at the lhc at @xmath1  = 5.02 tev in 2013 .",
    "first results are already submitted for publication @xcite .",
    "the alice detector allows to study the @xmath0  production down to zero transverse momentum in two decay channels : dimuon at forward and dielectron at mid - rapidity . in this work",
    "we will concentrate on the dimuon channel , studied in the muon spectrometer @xcite with an acceptance @xmath13 . due to the lhc beam energy asymmetry the nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass system is shifted by @xmath14 in the direction of the proton beam with respect to the laboratory system .",
    "two configurations were adopted , obtained by inverting the direction of the two beams in the machine .",
    "the measurements of the @xmath0  production in alice were then performed in two different rapidity ranges : backward ( @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 ) and forward ( @xmath18@xmath16@xmath19 ) with an integrated luminosities of 5.81 @xmath20 0.19 nb@xmath21 and 5.03 @xmath20 0.18 nb@xmath21 , respectively .",
    "this analysis is based on the dimuon trigger selection , requiring a coincidence of minimum bias ( mb ) interaction with two opposite sign muon tracks detected in the trigger chambers of the muon spectrometer .",
    "the mb trigger efficiency for non - single - diffractive events is @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the dimuon trigger efficiency reaches @xmath23 for @xmath241.5 gev/@xmath3 . to reject single muons at the edge of the acceptance of spectrometer the condition of @xmath25",
    "was required .",
    "the raw @xmath0  yield was extracted by fitting the opposite - sign dimuon invariant mass spectrum by the sum of a background and a signal function .",
    "the numbers of @xmath0  and its systematic uncertainty were evaluated from different fits varying background , signal ( @xcite ) functions and the fitting range .",
    "the acceptance times efficiency ( @xmath26 ) was estimated using a pure @xmath0  signal monte - carlo simulation tuned on the real data kinematic distributions .",
    "the integrated values of @xmath26 are ( @xmath27)% and ( @xmath28)% for the backward and forward rapidity regions , respectively . the difference in the values results from different tracking efficiency in the two periods of data taking . in order to study the nuclear effects on the @xmath0  production in p - pb collisions ,",
    "the nuclear modification factor @xmath29 defined as ( [ eq : raa ] ) was used .",
    "given the fact that there are no measurements of @xmath9 at @xmath30 5.02 tev , an interpolation procedure was followed , based on the following steps :    * * energy interpolation : * existing alice pp results at @xmath31 and 7 tev ( covering @xmath32 in six bins ) were interpolated with empirical shapes ( linear , power law and exponential ) . * * rapidity interpolation / extrapolation : * due to the @xmath33-shift in p - pb , the results from the previous step were fitted with empirical shapes ( gaussian , polynomial ) to reach the desired @xmath33-coverage .",
    "the results of the procedure were validated by comparison with theoretical models : cem @xcite and actual fonll calculation for @xmath12 production @xcite .",
    "the values for @xmath9 scaled by the pb - nucleus mass number are shown in the left panel of fig.[sigma ] by a blue band representing the uncertainties estimated by this procedure .",
    "in addition to @xmath29 the forward - to - backward ratio @xmath34 , defined as : @xmath35 and independent on the pp reference cross section , was also studied .",
    "@xmath34 was measured in a narrower rapidity range ( @xmath36@xmath16@xmath37 ) than @xmath29 .",
    "the advantages of @xmath34 are that nuclear thickness function and @xmath9 cancel out in the ratio and therefore , a pp interpolation is not needed .",
    "however the overall statistics was reduced by 30% .",
    "the measured @xmath0  cross - sections in p - pb collisions at @xmath1  = 5.02 tev for the full statistics are shown in fig.[sigma ] differentially in @xmath33 ( left panel ) and in @xmath38 ( right panel ) . in the backward region the @xmath0  production is larger , and softer in @xmath38 . the nuclear modification factors @xmath29 integrated over @xmath39for the forward and backward rapidity ranges are :    @xmath29 ( @xmath40@xmath16@xmath41 ) = @xmath42    @xmath29 ( @xmath43@xmath16@xmath44)=@xmath45    the uncertainty is dominated by the pp interpolation and the tracking efficiency . in fig.[rpa ] the rapidity dependence of @xmath29 is presented . in the forward rapidity region the color glass condensate ( cgc)-based model underestimates the data while predictions of models including parton energy loss and/or shadowing are in fair agreement with the data .",
    "an integrated value of @xmath46 was measured . in fig.[rfb ]",
    "the results on @xmath34 are shown as a function of rapidity ( left ) and @xmath47 ( right ) .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath34 is dominated by the tracking efficiency . a model which includes shadowing as the only cnm effect slightly overestimates the data integrated over @xmath38 , while the inclusion of an energy loss component leads to a better agreement .",
    "a sizeable @xmath47 dependence of @xmath34 with a stronger suppression at low @xmath47 is measured .",
    "theoretical models including energy loss and shadowing show strong nuclear matter effects at low @xmath47 in fair agreement with the data .",
    "inclusive @xmath0  suppression was measured by alice in p - pb collisions at @xmath1  = 5.02 tev . the @xmath34 ( @xmath29 )",
    "were measured vs @xmath33 and @xmath39(vs @xmath33 ) and compared with theoretical models . within uncertainties , both the shadowing and",
    "the coherent energy loss approaches give a fair description of the data , while the cgc - inspired model underestimates the data .",
