    "the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) of may 8 , 1997 was a watershed event in the study of these intriguing objects .",
    "there were two major advances resulting from afterglow observations of : ( 1 ) the first unambiguous evidence that some grbs are a cosmological population was obtained with the detection of red - shifted metal lines in absorption against the optical afterglow ( metzger et al .",
    "the resulting lower limit on the distance , combined with the measured gamma - ray fluence , established an approximate energy scale for these events .",
    "( 2 ) the discovery of the first radio afterglow and the demonstration of relativistic expansion of the fireball ( frail et al .",
    "the latter was made possible by the observations of distinctive variations in the radio flux and attributed to interstellar scintillation ( goodman 1997 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that grbs now join quasars and galactic micro - quasars as sources for which superluminal motions have been inferred .",
    "the afterglow from grb 970508 was particularly bright and long - lived .",
    "indeed , to this date , this grb remains unusual in both these respects .",
    "consequently , astronomers carried out intensive observations of the afterglow across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "the principal motivation of the observations were to infer the fundamental parameters of the explosion : the total energy of the explosion ( @xmath7 ) , the distribution of the circumburst medium ( density , @xmath8 and possible radial dependence as would be the case if the explosion took place in a circumburst medium shaped by mass loss from the progenitor ) and the geometry of the afterglow ( sphere versus collimated flow or `` jets '' ) .",
    "of all the parameters listed above , @xmath7 is perhaps the most eagerly sought parameter .",
    "after all , in a manner similar to supernovae , it is @xmath7 which sets the scale for the entire grb phenomenon and thus it is a truly fundamental parameter of the explosion . with few exceptions ( katz & piran 1997 , brainerd 1998 ) most of the early estimates for @xmath7 ( waxman 1997 , wijers & galama 1999 , granot et al .",
    "1999 ) lie within a factor of three of @xmath9 erg .",
    "although their precise methodologies differ , all of these determinations use information gleaned from the early afterglow observations .",
    "unfortunately , the lorentz factor is large during the early phase and due to relativistic beaming the observer sees only solid angle @xmath10 of the emitting surface .",
    "thus the inferred energy is necessarily the `` isotropic equivalent '' value .",
    "however , if fireballs are jet sources ( as appears to be the case ) , such `` isotropic equivalent '' estimates are upper limits and in some cases can be gross upper limits ( e.g. grb 990510 , harrison et al .",
    "1999 )    radio observations are essentially immune from the geometry of the fireball and thus offer us the best method to infer @xmath7 since much of the radio afterglow is emitted at later epoch when @xmath11 is falling .",
    "indeed , over the duration of the radio emission , the emitting material typically becomes sub - relativistic .",
    "once the flow becomes sub - relativistic it will in due course also become spherical .",
    "thus observations of radio afterglows allow us the opportunity of inferring @xmath7 without the usual concerns of the geometry of the fireball .",
    "radio observations offer two additional advantages : ( 1 ) at x - ray and optical wavelengths , the afterglow emission rapidly enters the monotonic decaying regime within minutes to hours of the burst .",
    "unfortunately , at the current time , logistical difficulties prevent us from responding so rapidly to grb events .",
    "x - ray and optical afterglow observations are typically initiated hours after the burst .",
    "however , at radio wavelengths , the entire afterglow phenomenon is stretched in time .",
    "thus monitoring the radio afterglow observations allows us to see all the important transitions ( save the cooling transition ) which in turn provides key diagnostics to infer the fundamental parameters of the explosion .",
    "( 2 ) radio observations offer us , via interstellar scintillations , the only way to measure the tiny angular size ( few microarcseconds ) of grb afterglows .",
    "the measured size in turn allows us to verify the dynamics of the explosion .    in this paper",
    ", we present the complete radio light curves from the radio afterglow of  beginning 3.5 hrs after the burst and ending 450 d later when the source was no longer detectable .",
    "this is the third and final paper of an ambitious monitoring program that we initiated following the discovery of radio afterglow from . in the first paper ( frail et al .",
    "1997 ) we reported the discovery of the radio afterglow and the first 90 d of observations , and we interpreted the strong variations as being due to diffractive scintillation . in the second paper ( waxman , kulkarni &  frail 1998 ; hereafter , wkf98 ) we compared these observations to theoretical models and showed that the size estimated from diffractive scintillation was in excellent accord with that expected from hydrodynamical models . in the same paper we noted that the observed flux at late times ( @xmath12 d ) was well below that predicted by a spherical model and suggested that this deviation was most likely explained by a jet - like geometry for the fireball rather than a sphere .",
    "we suggested that @xmath7 would be significantly lower than the @xmath9 erg isotropic equivalent estimate from the early afterglow observations and the isotropic equivalent @xmath3-ray energy release and further suggested that the fireball would undergo a transition from relativistic to sub - relativistic expansion at @xmath0  d.    the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "the observations are summarized in  [ sec : observations ] . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] we present the basic results in the form of light curves in three bands , 8.46 ghz , 4.86 ghz and 1.43 ghz . in  [ sec : riss ] we note a transition of the variations in the light curve from the diffractive to the refractive regimes . in ",
    "[ sec : spherical ] we compare the data to the expectations from the simple adiabatic fireball model . in ",
    "[ sec : deviations ] we point out important deviations from model predictions and argue that the afterglow was not spherical but was a jet with an opening angle of about 30 degrees .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : sub - relativistic ] we propose a detailed sub - relativistic model which provides a satisfactory explanation to the very late time observations .",
    "the transition to non - relativistic regime allows us to carry out proper calorimetry of the explosion (  [ sec : calorimetry ] ) .",
    "except where noted , all observations reported here were obtained at the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",
    "the very first observation was made in the 1.4-ghz band , only 3.5 hrs after the initial gamma - ray detection of  ( costa et al .",
    "table 1 lists each observing session giving the starting date , the time elapsed since the burst , the 1.43 ghz flux density of  ( f@xmath13 ) and the vla configuration .",
    "the first detection of the source was made on 1997 may 13.96 ut at 8.46 ghz . except for the first week , it was customary to observe at 8.46 ghz and 4.86 ghz simultaneously , so we include them together in table 2 .",
    "all flux density measurements prior to 1997 august were previously compiled in frail et al .",
    "( 1997 ) but are listed here for completeness .",
    "calibration of the array phase was accomplished using extragalactic radio sources with well - known positions .",
    "j0410 + 769 was used primarily at 1.43 ghz while j0726 + 791 was the calibrator of choice for 4.86 ghz and 8.46 ghz .",
    "since these compact sources usually vary on time scales of a month or more , the absolute flux scale ( accurate to better than @xmath142% ) at each epoch for all frequencies was fixed with observations of 3c , 3c , and/or 3c .",
    "the off - line analysis of the vla data proceeded following standard practice using the aips data reduction package .",
    "when the radio afterglow from  was clearly detected , its flux density was measured by a gaussian fitting procedure which solves for the peak and integrated intensity , the source position and its angular size . when the source is weak ( @xmath15 ) and no reliable fit was possible , the peak flux density was measured from the image at the reported position of  ( taylor et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the error estimates in tables 1 and 2 are based on the thermal noise fluctuations in the final image and are estimated by calculating the rms fluctuations in a region free of any obvious radio sources . in the d - array and to some extent in the cs array ,",
    "where the resolution at 1.43 ghz is poor , the limiting sensitivity is not due to the receiver noise but to the contribution of unresolved , faint sources within the beam .",
    "this quantity varies from point to point in the sky but is of order 80 @xmath16jy for a 45  beam at 1.4 ghz ( condon et al .",
    "improperly cleaned sidelobes from the myriad sources in the d - array 1.43 ghz images constitute a further source of confusion .",
    "together these effects can amount to 100 @xmath16jy of uncertainty added in quadrature to the error estimates of the d - array measurements given in table 1 .    while the source confusion discussed above",
    "is negligible at 4.86 and 8.46 ghz , there is a second source of error in the largest array configurations ( a and b ) which can also be difficult to quantify .",
    "atmospheric phase instabilities occurring on a time scale shorter than or comparable to the cycle time between calibrator and source will `` scatter '' flux from  and may introduce slight position offsets .",
    "large and erratic excursions of the calibrator phase over the course of an observing run are a useful diagnostic to indicate when this is occurring .",
    "suspect data is revealed in off - line processing by sudden jumps in the flux density of the phase calibrator from its long - term average and a significant difference between the peak and integrated flux densities in the gaussian fits of the radio emission from . following these criteria it was necessary to discard data from only four epochs in 1997 ( sept .",

    "* late - time light curves . * in figure [ fig : ltcurve ] we show the entire light curve of all three frequencies at which  was monitored by the vla .",
    "the behavior of the radio light curves in the first few months has been discussed elsewhere ( frail et al .",
    "1997 , wkf98 ) ; galama et al .",
    "( 1998a , b ) and shepherd et al .",
    "( 1998 ) report a few additional points at low and high frequencies as well . for the sake of completeness",

    "have a mean flux density of 555@xmath14108 @xmath16jy and 630@xmath14107 @xmath16jy , respectively .",
    "the modulation indices ( defined as the ratio of the rms flux variations to the mean ) are modest ( 1520% ) and the variations are well correlated between the two frequencies .",
    "this is very different from the narrow bandwidth , short time scale fluctuations seen in the first month and attributed to diffractive interstellar scattering ( frail et al .",
    "we return to this point in  [ sec : riss ] .    the light curve at 1.43 ghz ( table 1 and figure  [ fig : ltcurve ] ) is markedly different than the other two . as noted elsewhere ( frail et al .  1997 ,",

    "1998a ) the 1.43 ghz flux density is initially weak ( 125 @xmath16jy ) .",
    "this can best be understood if the source is optically thick at 1.43 ghz ( katz & piran 1997 ) . near day 50",
    "the source brightens considerably . between 50 and 300 days",
    "its average flux density is 300 @xmath16jy but with considerable scatter .",
    "most of this scatter likely originates from source confusion , particularly in the more compact array configurations ( see  [ sec : observations ] ) .",
    "near day 90 the light curves at 8.46 ghz and 4.86 ghz begin a power - law decay ( figure  [ fig : decay ] ) , similar to that which occurred much earlier at optical and x - ray wavelengths ( pian et al .",

    "power - law fits to the light curves in figure [ fig : decay ] for @xmath17 d give values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( defined as @xmath20 ) .",

    "* many of the features in the high frequency light curves have analogs in the spectral domain .",
    "for example , the narrow bandwidth ( @xmath21 ghz ) diffractive scintillation seen by frail et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is best demonstrated in figure [ fig : cxespec ] by the large swings in the spectral slope @xmath22 ( defined as @xmath23 ) between 8.46 ghz and 4.86 ghz .",
    "the spectral index appears to settle down by day 35 and we interpret this to mean that the diffractive scintillation has died down . indeed",
    ", this is to be expected since only sources smaller than a critical size can undergo diffractive scintillation .",
    "thus at sufficiently late times , expansion will ensure that the source enters the refractive regime (  [ sec : riss ] ) .",
    "since refractive scintillation is broadband ( see  [ sec : riss ] ) we see the true radio spectrum of the afterglow past day 35 . excluding two outlier points ,",
    "the mean @xmath22 for 11 measurements between day 40 and day 85 is + 0.25@xmath140.04 ( figure  [ fig : cxespec ] ) .",
    "galama et al .",
    "( 1998b ) determined @xmath24 near day 12 .",
    "since their estimate is based on extrapolations of the radio flux density when the source was scintillating strongly , the value of @xmath22 given here should be a more accurate one .",
    "in addition , the transition of the light curve to a power - law decay has a corresponding change in the spectral index plot of figure [ fig : cxspec ] , where @xmath22 undergoes an abrupt drop from positive to negative values .",
    "the weighted mean @xmath22 from day 95 to day 310 is @xmath250.3 .",
    "a joint fit to the spectrum and high frequency light curves of the form @xmath26 for @xmath27 days yields more accurate values of @xmath28 and @xmath29    * evolution of the radio spectrum . * in figure",
    "[ fig : allspec ] we follow the evolution of the radio afterglow by plotting all radio frequencies at different time intervals .",
    "these spectral `` snapshots '' show that the spectrum initially rises with frequency , flattens and then finally exhibits a power - law slope which declines with frequency .",
    "in frail et al . ( 1997 ) , we attributed the observed strong variability in the 8.46 ghz and 4.86 ghz bands over the course of the first month , to diffractive scintillation .",
    "the primary evidence for this inference is the observed strong , rapid ( decorrelation time , @xmath30 hr ) variability which is uncorrelated at 8.46 ghz and 4.86 ghz .",
    "these two characteristics , strong and chromatic variability , are the hallmarks of diffractive scintillation ( rickett 1977 ) . in contrast , beyond day 30 the variations are not only milder but also correlated between the two frequencies ( see  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "we attribute these variations to `` refractive '' scintillation .",
    "diffractive scintillation is caused by interference between rays diffracted by small - scale irregularities in the ionized interstellar medium .",
    "the resulting interference is narrow band and highly variable ( with the modulation index approaching unity ) .",
    "diffractive scintillation occurs only when the source size is smaller than a characteristic size , the so - called `` diffractive '' angle .",
    "thus as the fireball expands we expect the diffractive scintillation to be quenched .",
    "however , as explained by goodman ( 1997 ) , focusing and defocusing of the wavefront by large scale inhomogeneities in the ionized interstellar medium will also result in scintillation , albeit at a reduced level on a longer time scale compared to diffractive variations .",
    "this `` refractive '' scintillation , unlike the earlier diffractive scintillation , is broad - band , and , most importantly , is much less sensitive to the size of the source .",
    "thus , not surprisingly , refractive variability has been seen in many sources , whereas only the most compact sources  pulsars and grb afterglows  show diffractive scintillation .",
    "the light curves in figure [ fig : ltcurve ] and [ fig : cxlight ] show that the expected transition from the diffractive to the refractive regime did take place .",
    "the flux variations decrease , but do not vanish , after the first month . during this period ,",
    "the modulation index ( defined as the ratio of the rms flux variations to the mean ) is more modest ( 1520% ) compared to the first month when the modulation index was about 80% .",
    "the change in the nature of the flux variations is also seen in the spectral index curve ( figure [ fig : cxespec ] ) . over the first month",
    ", the flux variations were uncorrelated between 4.86 ghz and 8.46 ghz ( decorrelation bandwidth , @xmath31  ghz ) , as best demonstrated by the large swings in the spectral slope @xmath22 whose values varied randomly between @xmath32 to + 1.6 from one day to the next ( figure [ fig : cxespec ] ) . starting around day 40",
    ", @xmath22 converges to a constant value .",
    "we identify these slow , broad - band low - amplitude flux variations as being due to refractive scintillation , with the expansion of  taking it through a transition from the diffractive to refractive regimes .    in principle ,",
    "an independent estimate of the angular size could be determined from the refractive scintillation , but our sampling of the light curve is not sufficient to accurately measure the refractive decorrelation time scale or the modulation index . nonetheless , as a check for consistency , we now estimate the expected modulation index and refractive time scales and compare the same to the observations .",
    "we use the angular size of the fireball inferred from the diffractive scintillations , @xmath33arcsec at @xmath34 weeks ( wkf98 ) , and extrapolate this size forward in time as @xmath35 to obtain a size of @xmath36arcsec at @xmath37 weeks . from this expected angular size , and using the formulation of goodman ( 1997 ) , we infer the refractive time scales to be between 10 and 20 hrs and the modulation indices of order 40% to 25% at these frequencies . these estimates are consistent with our admittedly meager data .",
    "as remarked in  [ sec : introduction ] the principal motivation for afterglow observations is to deduce the fundamental parameters of the explosion . to this end",
    ", we now compare the radio observations with the expectation of the simplest model , the spherical adiabatic model .",
    "other authors have carried out similar analyses but based only on early - time ( @xmath38  d ) multi - wavelength observations ( waxman 1997 , wijers &  galama 1999 , granot et al . 1999 ) .",
    "they found good agreement with the basic expectation of spherical adiabatic models .",
    "the first predictive afterglow models ( mszros & rees 1993 , paczyski & rhoads 1993 , katz 1994 , mszros & rees 1997 ) actually preceded the discovery of the afterglow emission and have survived with relatively little modification ( sari 1997 , vietri 1997 , waxman 1997 , wijers , rees & mszros 1997 ) . in its most basic form",
    "the cosmological fireball model is a spherical blast wave , expanding adiabatically into a homogeneous medium of density @xmath8 .",
    "a fixed fraction @xmath39 of the blast wave energy @xmath7 goes into accelerating a power - law distribution of electrons with energy slope @xmath40 ( where the number of electrons with lorentz factor @xmath3 is @xmath41 for @xmath42 ) . in the presence of a magnetic field , which itself is a fixed fraction @xmath43 of the energy density of the blast wave ,",
    "the electrons emit synchrotron radiation .",
    "the instantaneous synchrotron spectrum emitted by the electrons consists of four distinct spectral regimes and is given by sari , piran & narayan ( 1998 ) for the `` slow cooling '' case when the radiative cooling time for the majority of electrons with lorentz factor @xmath44 is large compared to the dynamical time :    @xmath45    there are three transition frequencies : @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "they correspond to ( 1 ) the synchrotron self - absorption frequency @xmath46 below which the source becomes optically thick , ( 2 ) the peak frequency @xmath47 where the spectrum peaks at a flux density of f@xmath49 and ( 3 ) the cooling frequency @xmath48 above which radiative losses steepen the observed spectrum . in time , as the blast wave interacts with the surrounding medium , the shape of the spectrum is preserved but the peak of the spectrum shifts to lower frequencies .",
    "the time - dependence of the three transition frequencies for an adiabatically expanding blast wave is given by @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 with @xmath53 for most of the the time over which the afterglow is detectable .",
    "in addition , f@xmath49 is expected to remain constant with frequency . describing the evolution of the radio flux density as f@xmath54 for @xmath55 ( i.e. the optically thin regime ) we expect to see a slow rise to f@xmath49 as @xmath56 for @xmath22=+1/3 , followed by a power - law decline going as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 when @xmath60 ; and @xmath61 steepening a further @xmath62 when @xmath63 .",
    "the observations presented in  [ sec : results ] show substantially all of the gross spectral and temporal behavior expected from this basic model . in detail",
    "we find the following agreements with the model .",
    "* low energy spectral index .",
    "* at early times synchrotron self - absorption is clearly detected ( figure  [ fig : allspec ] and shepherd et al .",

    "when the diffractive interstellar scintillation between 4.86 ghz and 8.46 ghz has quenched , the low energy regime of the synchrotron spectrum ( i.e. @xmath64 ) is revealed .",
    "the measured slope of + 0.25@xmath140.04 ( figure  [ fig : cxspec ] ) is close to the predicted asymptotic value of 1/3 .",
    "this slope is a generic prediction of relativistic shocks which accelerate electrons with a power - law distribution of energies and have sharp cutoffs at low energies ( katz 1994 ) .",
    "* temporal decay : indices and time scales . *",
    "the decay in the 8.46 ghz and 4.86 ghz light curves ( figure [ fig : decay ] ) begins near day 90 and can be most easily seen in the spectral index plot of figure [ fig : cxspec ] , where the spectral slope undergoes an abrupt change from positive to negative values corresponding to the regime @xmath65 .",
    "the corresponding light curves have a power - law decay with a temporal slope near @xmath32 , comparable to that inferred from optical and x - ray observations ( see table 4 ) .",
    "as expected , the decay of the light curve for the lower frequency of 1.43 ghz begins much later ( figure [ fig : ltcurve ] ) .",
    "we can compare the time scale for the onset of the decay with the predicted @xmath66 dependence for @xmath47 . in table 3",

    "in the previous section we found that the spherical adiabatic fireball model provided a satisfactory explanation for the observations at a gross level . however , on closer inspection there are several important differences between the radio afterglow of  and the model predictions .",

    "* non - constancy of peak flux . * another important prediction of the spherical , adiabatic model is the constancy of the peak flux density f@xmath49 with time .",

    "the radio @xmath61 is identical to the late - time optical value but the radio @xmath22 is more similar to the early optical estimates before @xmath48 moved through the optical band .",
    "the relativistic spherical model is the simplest afterglow model and as such has received considerable attention from observers . apart from the assumptions of constant @xmath39 , @xmath43 and acceleration to a power law spectrum ,",

    "hints of deviations from the expectations of the spherical model were already apparent in the wkf98 paper ( see [ sec : introduction ] ) .    in this section ,",
    "we first qualitatively expand on these two ideas and find that the four problems identified in the previous section can be satisfactorily explained by a model incorporating jets .",
    "an inevitable consequence of a jet geometry is early ( compared to spherical geometry ) transition to the non - relativistic regime .",

    "* a jet with an opening angle of @xmath84 behaves as if it were a conical section of a spherical fireball , and can not be distinguished by a distant observer from a spherical fireball , as long as the expansion lorentz factor is larger than the inverse of the opening angle , @xmath85 .",
    "once the jet decelerates to @xmath86 , it expands sideways , leading to a decrease in blast wave energy per unit solid angle , which results in a deviation from spherical fireball behavior .",
    "the decrease in energy per unit solid angle leads to a decrease with time of @xmath83 , and suppresses the @xmath56 flux increase expected in the spherical model at frequencies @xmath87 .",
    "thus a jet geometry provides a reasonable explanation for the flattening of the radio light curves and the lack of constancy of @xmath83 (  [ sec : deviations ] ) .",
    "we set @xmath88 , the epoch when the jet becomes apparent to the observer , as 25 d ( see figure 1 of wkf98 ; also discussion in  [ sec : deviations ] ) .",
    "the lorentz factor corresponding to this epoch is @xmath89 , or equivalent to a jet opening angle @xmath90 .",
    "it was shown in wkf98 that on a time scale of @xmath91 , where @xmath88 is the time at which the jet decelerates to @xmath92 , the fireball approaches spherical , sub - relativistic expansion . a simple argument to understand this is as follows .",
    "the time at which we see deviation from spherical symmetry is @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the radius at which @xmath95 .",
    "the transition to spherical symmetry occurs over time scale @xmath96 , i.e. @xmath97 .",
    "in addition , since the mass enclosed within a sphere of radius @xmath94 , @xmath98 , is comparable to the total jet energy @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the energy inferred under the assumption of spherical symmetry , the fireball becomes sub - relativistic as it approaches spherical symmetry .",

    "the behavior of the radio flux observed at @xmath107  d is consistent with this expectation since past day 100 ( approximately the transition to sub - relativistic regime ) we obtain @xmath108 and @xmath109 (  [ sec : results ] ) . if the afterglow was in the sub - relativistic regime",

    "the non - constancy of @xmath46 can be explained as follows .",
    "there are two consequences in the sub - relativistic model when @xmath47 falls below @xmath46 occurs ( see wkf98 and appendix [ sec : nrmodel ] ) .",
    "first , @xmath46 is no longer constant but evolves as @xmath115 .",

    "the peak flux then evolves as @xmath116 . by itself ,",
    "the observed decrease in @xmath46 is consistent with the expectations of the sub - relativistic model .",
    "however , since one expects a similar temporal evolution of @xmath46 for @xmath75 in the relativistic model , it should not be taken as strong evidence in favor of the transition to sub - relativistic expansion .    the above conclusions , the manifestation of a jet at @xmath117 d and the sub - relativistic transition at about epoch 100  d have been arrived at using extensive radio data presented in this paper .",
    "independent support for this can be obtained from the optical data . as noted by rhoads ( 1999 )",
    "the optical data can not be fitted by a single power law decay functional form .",
    "rhoads derives a minimum beaming angle of @xmath118 , a value in complete agreement with our own .",
    "the principal strength of the radio result is the photometric uniformity of the data  the data were obtained with one instrument , the vla , in a standard mode . in contrast , the optical data come from diverse sources and vexing cross - calibration issues still remain .    in our model",
    ", we would predict that the optical flux would steepen beyond @xmath88 . a sharp break , such as the one seen in the light curve of grb ( e.g. harrison et al .",

    "numerical and analytical studies which track the dynamical evolution of the beamed ejecta ( moderski , sikora , & bulik 1999 , wei & li 1999 ) find that unless the opening angle is very small or that lateral expansion is unimportant , a smooth and gradual transition is expected . in addition , past day 100 , our model would predict a further , slight steepening [ cf .",

    "the spectral change at @xmath131  d ( figure [ fig : cxspec ] ) implies that the peak frequency @xmath47 decreases through the frequency range of 8.46  ghz to 4.86  ghz at @xmath132  d , i.e. that @xmath133  ghz .",
    "however , it should be noted that since in our model the fireball at time @xmath134  d is in transition to sub - relativistic spherical expansion ( see below ) , significant deviation from the sub - relativistic model prediction is possible at @xmath134  d. thus , the determination of @xmath122 is only approximate ( see figure [ fig : ewmodel ] ) .",
    "our conclusions remain unchanged , however , even with a factor of a few change in @xmath122 ( see below ) .    the parameters @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 are determined ( see appendix [ sec : nrmodel ] ) by the four parameters , which completely specify a sub - relativistic fireball model : the strength @xmath135 of the magnetic field at @xmath136 , the minimum lorentz factor @xmath137 of the radiating electrons at @xmath136 , the ( time independent ) number density @xmath138 of the shocked plasma , and the shock radius @xmath139 at @xmath136 .",

    "we then constrain @xmath139 by requiring that the derived minimum energy of the radiating electrons and magnetic field does not exceed the thermal energy of the sub - relativistic fireball , given by the sedov - von neumann - taylor formulation .    using equation  ( [ eq : a ] )",

    "the thermal energy in a sedov - taylor solution constitutes approximately half the total energy .",
    "the energy in the shocked electrons and in magnetic field clearly can not exceed the thermal energy .",

    "thus , although radio observations provide only three constraints on the four model parameters , a self - consistent solution is obtained only for @xmath177 this implies that electrons and magnetic fields are close to equipartition , that the fireball energy is @xmath178 and that the ambient density is @xmath179    interstellar scintillations provide a direct and independent confirmation of the derived radius .",
    "as noted in wkf98 , the observations of scintillation yield a fireball radius , @xmath180 cm at @xmath181  d which compares favorably with that stated in equation [ eq : r_0 ] .",
    "furthermore , the shock radius derived in equation ( [ eq : r_0 ] ) implies a shock velocity @xmath182 thus , our model predicts relativistic to sub - relativistic transition at @xmath0  d  as was indeed inferred from the @xmath4 d data .",
    "we also note that , assuming jet expansion at @xmath183  d , the inferred fireball energy is @xmath184 erg , rather than the isotropic @xmath185 erg , and in excellent agreement with the value obtained using the @xmath127100  d data .",
    "based on these same radio data , chevalier & li ( 1999a ) have proposed a model in which the afterglow is produced by the expansion of a shock into a circumburst medium , shaped by the mass loss history of the massive progenitor star . in this `` wind '' model ,",
    "one expects the ambient density to be @xmath186 whereas the density is expected to be constant for an explosion in the typical interstellar medium .",
    "there is increasing support for such models , both in direct evidence linking supernovae with gamma - ray bursts ( galama et al .",

    "1999 , chevalier & li 1999b , frail et al .",
    "we find , however , that a wind model is inconsistent with  data .",

    "of particular importance , is the location and subsequent evolution of the cooling frequency at early times . for an electron power - law index @xmath187 , implied by early afterglow observations ( galama _ et al .",
    "_ 1998a , b ) and used by chevalier & li , the flux at frequencies above the peak frequency makes a transition in the wind model from a @xmath188 decline to @xmath189 , as the cooling frequency @xmath48 passes through the band ( with @xmath190 ) .",
    "in contrast , for the same value of @xmath40 , in the constant density model , the cooling frequency decreases in time ( as @xmath191 ) and the flux at frequencies above the peak frequency makes a transition in the wind model from a @xmath192 decline to @xmath188 .    early afterglow observations ( galama et al",
    ". 1998b ) yield two independent estimates of @xmath48 , the first at @xmath193  hz at @xmath194  d and another at @xmath195  hz at @xmath196  d. chevalier & li ( 1999a ) have questioned the identification of @xmath48 at @xmath194  d , since the optical light curve prior to this time deviates significantly from light curves of afterglow models which account for @xmath197  d data .",
    "however , the existence of @xmath48 dropping through the optical band on time scale of days following the burst can also be inferred from infra - red observations ( pian et al . 1998 , chary et al . 1998 ) at @xmath198  d. the galama et al .",
    "observations imply that @xmath48 _ decreased _ in frequency from 1.4 days to 12.1 days , in clear contradiction with expectations for the wind model .",
    "furthermore , since these observations imply that @xmath48 had passed through the optical bands in the first few weeks , in the wind model both the optical flux ( at @xmath199  d ) and the radio flux ( at @xmath107  d ) should decline as @xmath189 .",
    "such behavior is in contradiction with observations , which show a @xmath188 flux decline at both optical and radio frequencies ( note that the optical flux decline in the wind model can be modified to follow a @xmath188 power law by modifying model parameters to give @xmath200  hz , so as to have @xmath48 below the optical band .",
    "however , such choice would be inconsistent with the value of @xmath48 inferred from observations ) .",
    "moreover , for the energy and density required to account for @xmath201  d observations , @xmath202  erg and @xmath203 , the wind lorentz factor at @xmath134  d is @xmath204 ( the lorentz factor is only weakly dependent on @xmath205 and @xmath138 , and for the parameter choice of chevalier & li @xmath206 ) .",
    "thus , the fireball becomes sub - relativistic at @xmath107  d and the flux scaling with time , @xmath207 , which applies for @xmath208 , changes to the sub - relativistic scaling @xmath209 , making the discrepancy with the observed scaling even larger .",
    "second , let us consider the self - absorption frequency .",
    "our data clearly shows that the flux at 1.43  ghz is self absorbed up to at least @xmath134  d. the time dependence of the self absorption frequency in a wind model , @xmath210 , therefore implies that for this model to fit the late time radio data @xmath211  ghz is required ( indeed the self - absorption frequency for the parameters chosen in chevalier & li is @xmath212 ghz ) .",
    "this is in marked contradiction with the value inferred from the data , @xmath213  ghz ( note that this discrepancy in @xmath46 implies a factor of @xmath214 discrepancy between model and observations in the 1.43  ghz to 8.46  ghz flux ratio ) .",

    "the fireball is a wide - angle jet which gradually expands sideways and becomes a spherical sub - relativistic shell by about day 100 .",

    "the spherical model which explains the early afterglow quite nicely over - predicts the observed radio flux by day 25 .",
    "we had earlier proposed that this discrepancy could be explained by invoking a jet geometry for the fireball ( wkf98 ) . to our knowledge",
    "this was the first explicit suggestion for a jet in a grb .",
    "we argue that the jet starts significant sideways expansion at @xmath219  d , and that by day 100 , the fireball becomes essentially a spherically symmetric sub - relativistically expanding shell .",
    "the primary observational evidence supporting the transition to the sub - relativistic regime is relation between power law temporal and spectral indices , which is inconsistent with relativistic expansion , and consistent with sub - relativistic expansion .",
    "the radio observations presented here of the sub - relativistic phase of fireball expansion are unique . in this phase ,",
    "the geometry of the fireball is no longer an issue , and the fireball dynamics is described by the well known sedov - von neumann - taylor self - similar solution .",
    "thanks to the extensive radio data ( multi - band and long - term monitoring ) we are able to deduce three out of the four fundamental parameters of the synchrotron emitting fireball shell : @xmath135 , the magnetic field strengths ; @xmath8 , the ambient density ; @xmath139 , the radius of the shell ; and @xmath137 , the lorentz factor of the emitting electrons . leaving the radius as the free parameter we estimate the total energy of the emitting particles ( including the energy in magnetic fields ) .",
    "we then use the constraint that this energy must not exceed the thermal energy of the a sedov - von neumann - taylor expanding shell .",
    "this constraint then yields the size , and hence the total energy , of the expanding shell .",
    "we find the following : @xmath1 erg and @xmath220 @xmath221 .",
    "furthermore , we find that the electrons and magnetic field are close to equipartition with @xmath222 . confidence in this `` absolute '' calorimetry is obtained when we note that the inferred size of the shell is comparable to that measured from interstellar scintillations ( during the early phase ) . furthermore , our model for @xmath107  d predicts that the transition to sub - relativistic regime takes place at @xmath0 , as is indeed observed ( see above ) .    without any doubt , the most important result of this paper is the estimate of the total energy released in the explosion .",
    "this energy , @xmath1 erg is well below @xmath9 erg , determined from early afterglow observations and the isotropic @xmath3-ray energy release of @xmath218 erg .",

    "<S> the derived total energy , @xmath1 erg is well below the @xmath2 erg inferred under the assumption of spherical symmetry from @xmath3-ray and early afterglow observations . </S>",
    "<S> a natural consequence of this result , which can also account for deviations at @xmath4 days from the spherical relativistic fireball model predictions , is that the fireball was initially a wide - angle jet of opening angle @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis also allows to determine the energy fractions carried by electrons and magnetic field , and the density of ambient medium surrounding the fireball . </S>",
    "<S> we find that during the sub - relativistic expansion electrons and magnetic field are close to equipartition , and that the density of the ambient medium is @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred density rules out the possibility that the fireball expands into a strongly non - uniform medium , as would be expected , e.g. , in the case of a massive star progenitor .    </S>",
