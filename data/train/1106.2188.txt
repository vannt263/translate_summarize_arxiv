    "in a scenario dubbed `` chain inflation '' @xcite it was suggested that the dynamics of inflation may be dominated by a series ( chain ) of phase transitions , each induced by the quantum nucleation of bubbles ( tunneling events ) .",
    "provided that each phase transition occurs much less than one hubble time after the previous one , this scenario is free from the problem of `` old inflation '' @xcite that the space still in the previous phase continues to inflate and prevents the completion of a phase transition .",
    "the need for several phase transitions per hubble time , and the requirement that inflation persist for at least @xmath2 hubble times to solve the flatness and horizon problems , means that the scenario requires a potential with a large number of minima , tunneled through in sequence .",
    "this is a challenge for model building but not an insurmountable one .",
    "the density perturbations arising from chain inflation have been investigated in @xcite . a simplified model of chain inflation",
    "was proposed in @xcite . however , in these works either the density fluctuation has to be determined numerically , or features of standard slow roll inflation ( with vacuum fluctuations instead of fluctuations from tunneling ) are assumed in the calculation .",
    "thus an analytical calculation for the perturbation theory is still absent for chain inflation .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate three properties of chain inflation which seem not to have been addressed , and which are each troubling from the point of view of building realistic models .",
    "first , when the chain of tunneling events takes place in a single field direction , the collision of two bubble walls will trigger a nucleation of the next phase .",
    "second , the rate at which the field , responsible for the chain of phase transitions , moves along its potential is controlled by the rate of bubble nucleations .",
    "but since bubble nucleations are stochastic in nature , the fluctuations in the field value , which become curvature perturbations , are controlled by the poisson statistics of nucleation events .",
    "to meet current observational limits on curvature perturbations requires of order @xmath1 phase transitions per hubble time during the observable part of inflation , requiring a potential with of order @xmath3 or more local minima to tunnel through successively .",
    "the third problem is that it is challenging to provide a potential where the nucleation rate between minima is large enough to support chain inflation , in a field theory that remains valid to scales that are much higher than the mass of the field .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : setup - backgr - dynam ] , we set up our model and discuss the dynamics of bubble collisions which are essential to understanding the overall evolution of the inflaton . in section [ sec : evolution ]",
    "we compute the time dependence of the mean field which constitutes the homogeneous and isotropic background . in section [ sec : power - spectrum ] , we consider the density perturbations and we calculate the power spectrum analytically , showing that it takes a simple form .",
    "section [ sec : models ] investigates the simplest explicit realization of a chain inflation model and identifies a narrow region of parameter space in which it satisfies observational and internal consistency requirements . in section [ sec : non - gaussianities ] , we consider three- and higher - point correlations .",
    "we consider generalizations in section [ sec : generalizations ] and conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider a simple model of chain inflation , with a single scalar field whose potential is a combination of an oscillation and a slope .",
    "specifically , we consider @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a slowly varying potential and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are constants . a potential of this kind is illustrated in figure [ fig : potential ] . in practice",
    "the pertinent features of the potential are that each minimum is lower than the last , and that the nucleation rate between each pair of minima is approximately the same .",
    "we will also assume that the mean spacetime separation between nucleation events is large compared to the size of a bubble at nucleation .",
    "otherwise , a description in terms of bubble nucleations does not make sense .",
    "since nucleation events must in turn be common on the hubble scale , this ensures that the instanton method @xcite applies .",
    "we will also assume that most of the energy from the potential drop between minima goes into accelerating the bubble wall .",
    "unlike the case in @xcite , there is a chain of metastable vacua . as we now argue , in this case collisions of bubble walls trigger the subsequent phase nucleation .",
    "( this phenomenon has been previously discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) specifically , numbering the potential minima from high to low as @xmath8 , when an interface between minima 1 and 2 meets another interface between 1 and 2 , they pass through each other and become interfaces between minima 2 and 3 . to see why , note first that the walls become very relativistic and lorentz contract to much narrower than the `` natural '' width set by the mass ( second derivative of the potential ) .",
    "the process of walls crossing therefore occurs on length and time scales shorter than the natural scale in the potential .",
    "therefore it is controlled by the kinetic term .",
    "scalar field dynamics governed by only the kinetic term is free field theory , which is solved by the linear wave equation . according to the linear wave equation , when two interfaces meet , in which the field changes from value @xmath9 to value @xmath10 , they pass through each other , turning into interfaces where @xmath11 changes from @xmath10 to @xmath12 .",
    "this is precisely the same behavior as colliding kinks in the sine - gordon model .",
    "these remarks apply both in our case , and to the case of a potential with only two minima .",
    "when there are only two minima , the region between the bubble walls is displaced from the potential minimum and the field there oscillates , with a time scale set by the parameters of the potential .",
    "these oscillations exhaust the energy of the bubble walls , which slow and stop , completing the transition .",
    "but in our case , the new value of the field after the walls have crossed is again a minimum of the potential , and the field stays there . after passing each other ,",
    "the walls are again interfaces connecting a higher to a lower minimum , and they continue to accelerate .",
    "we have verified these statements by simulating wave interactions in 1 + 1 dimensional classical field theory using the potential from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sample - potential ] ) .",
    "some snapshots of the field configuration as two walls meet are provided in figure [ fig : collide ] as an illustration .",
    "collision of bubble walls .",
    "short - dashed lines show @xmath11 at two moments before the walls meet ; solid lines show @xmath11 at a series of times as the walls meet ; long dashes show two times after the walls have crossed .",
    "when the walls cross , they switch from connecting minima 1 and 2 , to connecting minima 2 and 3 . , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    since the bubble walls do not stop or dissipate their energy when they collide , no thermal radiation is created by bubble collisions .",
    "thus we do not need to worry about the perturbations and back - reaction from the radiation components created by the wall collisions . since energy in bubble walls redshifts like radiation , at rest , @xmath13 $ ] and then boosting by a large factor for a bubble moving near the speed of light .",
    "the diagonal part after boosting is @xmath14 $ ] from which it follows that the pressure is @xmath15 . ]",
    "they also do not come to dominate the energy density of the system .",
    "however , there is another complication of nucleation in a potential with multiple minima such as that given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sample - potential ] ) .",
    "when the `` slope '' is relatively large compared to the `` oscillation , '' quantified by the parameter @xmath16 , not all of the potential energy liberated by a bubble wall goes into accelerating the wall .",
    "some goes into creating ripples in the @xmath11 field , as illustrated in figure [ ripples ] , which shows moving bubble wall profiles for @xmath17 . solving the field equations for a single accelerating bubble wall using the potential of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sample - potential ] ) , we find that for @xmath18 these ripples grow large enough that they overshoot the next barrier and induce the next phase transition .",
    "this sets off a cascade in which @xmath11 `` runs away '' down the potential .",
    "so @xmath19 is required to ensure that bubble nucleations only induce a single phase transition and do not set off a catastrophic run down the potential .",
    "this puts a lower limit on the potential barrier relative to the potential drop between minima .",
    "( note that at @xmath20 the minima disappear ; so the limiting value of @xmath21 is quite close to where the potential becomes monotonic . )",
    "profile of a bubble wall , moving towards the right , for several values of @xmath21 the ratio of `` slope '' to `` oscillation '' heights in the potential .",
    "the larger the slope , the larger the `` ripples '' which appear behind the wall . for a critical value of @xmath21 just larger than the",
    "largest shown , the ripples nucleate the next transition.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    this requirement on the potential has consequences for the bubble nucleation action . applying the procedure of coleman _",
    "@xcite to find the nucleation action @xmath22 for the potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sample - potential ] ) ( without making any thin - wall approximation ) , we find the result depends only on @xmath21 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 , where the function @xmath25 is fit by @xmath26 on the interval @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , at the critical value @xmath28 , we find that @xmath29 .",
    "( for smaller values of @xmath21 , @xmath25 is even larger , so this represents the best case for getting a large tunneling rate . )",
    "the nucleation action can only be made small by choosing a large value for @xmath30 .",
    "but this quantity is also the maximal value of the fourth derivative of the potential .",
    "provided that the potential can be regarded as the effective potential of a canonically normalized scalar field in a four - dimensional quantum field theory , the potential is only stable against large loop corrections if @xmath31 is small enough , , defined at some physical scale @xmath32 , then the potential as measured at a more infrared scale @xmath33 will have a smaller value @xmath34 .",
    "the condition @xmath35 is therefore unavoidable if we demand that the theory _ exist _ at an energy scale a few times higher than the mass scale of the potential @xmath36 .",
    "] say , @xmath37 . imposing this condition",
    ", we find @xmath38 .",
    "this leads to a bubble nucleation rate @xmath39 which may be too small to allow the phase transitions to complete in a hubble time .",
    "we will see that this requirement makes it difficult , though not impossible , to find consistent models of chain inflation .",
    "we now proceed to study how the mean field @xmath40 evolves in chain inflation , which is quite different from the slow - roll dynamics of conventional inflation models .",

    "light cones are straight lines with slope @xmath43 .",
    "the tunneling rate can be written as a function of time as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the tunneling rate in comoving coordinates and conformal time , and @xmath46 is the tunneling rate in physical coordinates .",

    "therefore the scalar field value at a point @xmath48 is determined by a sum over all spontaneous nucleation events in the past light cone .",

    "unlike the case of perturbative quantum fluctuations from the vacuum , in chain inflation the perturbations come from light - cone shaped bubbles . thus one might worry about the gaussianity of the scenario .",

    "in this section we briefly discuss three generalizations of single - field chain inflation , namely the curvaton scenario , the multi - field case , and a noncanonical kinetic term .",
    "we start with the curvaton scenario , where there is a second field whose rolling ( or other dynamics ) dominates the change in the total energy density . in this case",

    "@xmath168 is related to the field fluctuation as @xmath174 .",
    "after the curvaton @xmath11 decays , @xmath175 becomes constant , thus @xmath86 is subsequently conserved .",
    "the power spectrum can be calculated similarly to the last section as @xmath176 since it is suppressed by @xmath177 , the original fluctuation in the @xmath11 field may be large .",
    "this reduces the number of minima needed in the @xmath11 potential , but at the same time it increases the non - gaussianity @xmath178 , which should be the best estimator for non - gaussianity , and is potentially observable .",
    "it is also interesting to generalize the simplest scenario to a multi - field case , where a chain of tunnelings can take place in more than one field direction .",
    "whenever successive tunnelings occur in orthogonal field - space directions , the collision of bubble walls will not trigger a new phase nucleation .    in this case , for a given nucleation rate @xmath46",
    ", an individual observer will undergo fewer phase transitions . specifically , the mean inter - bubble spacing is @xmath179 , the mean time between phase changes for a comoving observer is @xmath180 , and so the mean number of phase changes per hubble time is @xmath181 , not @xmath182 as we found for the single - field case .",
    "perturbations in this scenario remain correlated on scales shorter than the hubble scale .",
    "the reason is that , while individual bubble walls no longer propagate hubble scale distances , _ information _ about bubble nucleations still can . as an illustration ,",

    "but the probability that @xmath21 will encounter another phase change and get to @xmath184 is determined by the likelihood of a nucleation occurring in the shaded area in its past light cone .",
    "this region is larger , and hence the chance of a nucleation is larger , than the shaded area in @xmath121 s past light cone .",
    "therefore , unevennesses in the phase boundary allows regions which are `` behind '' to `` catch up , '' at least on sub - hubble scales .",
    "this means that perturbations from the stochastic nature of nucleations get averaged over roughly hubble - scale volumes .    however , on super - hubble scales no such communication is possible .",
    "therefore the progress of the field @xmath11 on super - hubble scales is still determined by the independent , poisson - distributed number of nucleations in the past light cone .",

    "we have not been able to evaluate the order-1 coefficient analytically in this case .",

    "( we are not enthusiastic enough about this generalization to do a full numerical solution of the bubbles . ) the most important constraints , those on the spectral index and the reheat temperature , are both relaxed since the spectral index bound goes like @xmath199 while the reheating bound has the form @xmath200 .",
    "we find that the minimum allowed value of @xmath125 decreases to @xmath201 for @xmath202 mev , and to @xmath203 for @xmath204 gev .",
    "the model remains rather strongly coupled , but less so than for a standard kinetic term .",
    "to conclude , we reconsidered models of chain inflation focusing on the single - field case , and giving what we consider to be the first correct derivation of the spectrum of fluctuations , taking into account their poisson nature as a result of the dynamics of bubble collisions .",
    "we showed that the power spectrum can be calculated analytically and that consistency with the size of density perturbations measured today requires @xmath1 tunnelings per hubble volume per e - fold .",
    "therefore single - field models of chain inflation need a potential with at least @xmath205 successive minima , a significant challenge for model building .",
    "the spectral tilt depends on details of the potential ; it can be either red or blue and need not be small .",
    "non - gaussianities in the model are small , of order unity .",
    "thermal contributions to the fluctuations are negligible in this scenario because the energy stored in bubble walls remains in them after they collide .",
    "a challenge for chain inflation is posed by a standard requirement of consistency for any field theory . under renormalization ,",
    "couplings run , and large couplings run very fast . in order to have any nonnegligible range of scales over which the theory remains valid , the effective coupling given by the fourth derivative of the potential must not be much larger than @xmath206 .",
    "we have shown that this requirement , together with constraints on the spectral index and reheating temperature , leaves only a small interval of parameter space that gives a large enough nucleation rate .",
    "on the other hand , the method used to calculate the power spectrum and non - gaussianity in this model may find application for cases where other discrete processes instead of a continuous process take over the role of quantum fluctuations during inflation  for example , if the scale of inflation is very high and physics becomes discrete near the planck scale .",
