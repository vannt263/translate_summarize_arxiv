    "the epoch of reionization ( hereafter , eor ) , which marks the end of the universe s ` dark ages ' , is one of the least explored epochs in cosmic evolution . currently , there are two main observational constraints on the eor .",
    "the first is the sudden jump in the lyman-@xmath2 optical depth in the gunn - peterson troughs @xcite observed in the sloan digital sky survey quasar spectra @xcite , marking a lower limit to the redshift at which the universe became completely ionized .",
    "the second constraint comes from the fifth year wmap satellite data on the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite which gives an integral constraint on the thomson optical depth experienced by the cmb photons since the eor .",
    "however , both of these observational methods provide limited information on the reionization process .",
    "the redshifted 21-cm hyperfine transition line of neutral hydrogen is the most promising and immediately accessible method for probing the intergalactic medium ( igm ) during reionization ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",

    ". measurements of the 21-cm signal can also help to constrain the cosmological parameters independently @xcite .",
    "future telescopes like lofar , mwa , 21cma and ska are being designed to study the redshifted 21-cm signal from the eor .",
    "a successful detection of this signal will help us derive the nature of the first sources and their impact on the surrounding igm .",
    "unfortunately however , the cosmological eor signal is contaminated by a slew of astrophysical and non - astrophysical components . typically , the contamination level is orders of magnitude larger than the cosmological 21-cm signal .",
    "thus , the primary challenge of the eor observations will be the accurate modelling of the various data components  foregrounds , instrumental response , ionospheric disturbances , to name a few  which is essential to develop a robust signal extraction scheme .    for the foregrounds ,",
    "there are currently no available data in the 115 - 180  mhz frequency range and 4 arcmin resolution at high galactic latitude that would allow accurate modelling of the lofar - eor foregrounds .",
    "therefore , one has to rely on the available relevant data and extrapolate , based on theoretical arguments , into the frequency range and resolution observed by lofar .",
    "however , recently @xcite used @xmath3 obervations with giant meter wave radio telescope to characterize the statistical properties  visibility correlation function  of the foregrounds .",
    "this paper focuses on simulating the galactic and extragalactic foregrounds that dominate the sky at frequencies of interest for the lofar - eor experiment ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) .",
    "the main foreground components are : galactic synchrotron emission from diffuse and localised sources , galactic thermal ( free - free ) emission and integrated emission from extragalactic sources ( like radio galaxies and clusters ) .",
    "the dominant component of the foregrounds is the galactic synchrotron emission ( @xmath670 per cent ) .",
    "the extragalactic emission contributes @xmath627 per cent and galactic free - free emission @xmath61 per cent @xcite .",
    "although the difference between the mean amplitude of the eor signal and the foregrounds is expected to be 4 - 5 orders of magnitude , an interferometer like lofar measures only the fluctuations which in this case are expected to be different by ` only ' three orders of magnitude .",
    "various authors have studied the foregrounds in the context the eor measurements . @xcite",
    "have studied the diffuse synchrotron and free - free emission from our galaxy and extragalactic sources ; @xcite and @xcite have considered emission from unresolved extragalactic sources at low radio frequencies ; and @xcite and @xcite studied the effect of free - free emission from extragalactic haloes . over the years , several methods have been explored to filter out the foregrounds .",
    "most of the methods rely on the relative smoothness in the frequency of the foregrounds , with respect to the signal @xcite .",
    "@xcite have studied the foregrounds for the eor experiment and their influence on the measurement of the 21-cm signal . in their multi - frequency analysis of the power spectra",
    ", they considered four types of foregrounds : galactic diffuse synchrotron emission ; galactic free - free emission ; extragalactic free - free emission ; and extragalactic point sources .",
    "they showed that foregrounds cleaning is aided by the large scale angular correlation , especially of the extragalactic point sources , which facilitates signal extraction to a level suitable for the eor experiments .",
    "the current study is part of the general effort undertaken by the lofar - eor key science project to produce simulated data cubes .",
    "the pipeline under construction will simulate the lofar - eor data cube that includes the simulated cosmological 21-cm signal , the galactic and extragalactic foregrounds , ionospheric effects , radio frequency interferences ( rfis ) and the instrumental response .",
    "these datacubes will be used to design the observational strategy and test our signal - processing methods .",
    "our main concern in this paper is the simulation of the galactic and extragalactic foregrounds .",
    "recently , a study by @xcite has been conducted along lines similar to parts of the current paper .",
    "the authors test a certain signal extraction algorithm on simulated foregrounds maps in which they take most of the relevant foregrounds into account .",
    "however , there are many important differences between the two papers .",
    "first , in the @xcite study the assumption for the noise level in the lofar - eor project , as well as the other experiments , is at least an order of magnitude too low .",
    "they assume 1 and 5  mk noise models whereas in reality the noise for the lofar - eor experiment is about 50  mk .",
    "they also present a simplified model of the galactic foregrounds that does not take into account all the spatial and frequency correlations of the galactic diffuse synchrotron emission and underestimates that of the galactic free - free emission , both of which are very important .",
    "in contrast to them , we also present polarized maps and introduce the lofar instrumental response and noise in a realistic manner .",
    "in the foregrounds simulations presented in this paper we choose a different approach from previous groups , since our main aim is to produce the simulations that will be part of the lofar - eor data pipeline . in this context our main aim is to produce foregrounds maps in the angular and frequency range of the lofar - eor experiment , i.e. 3d datacubes , and then use those simulations for testing the accuracy of removal of the foregrounds .",
    "section  [ sec : polarization ] outlines the importance of the polarized character of the foregrounds and how to model the stokes i , q , and u polarization maps of the galactic synchrotron emission .",
    "section  [ sec : inst ] presents simulated instrumental effects of the lofar telescope and their influence on the foregrounds maps , and section  [ sec : extraction ] discusses a method to extract the eor signal from the foregrounds .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion and outlook ( section  [ sec : discussion and outlook ] ) .",

    "we have assumed that the color temperature , @xmath29 , is equal to @xmath30 .",
    "the kinetic coupling term increases with the kinetic temperature , whereas the @xmath28 coupling term is due to the lyman-@xmath2 pumping , known also as the wouthuysen - field effect @xcite .",
    "the two coupling terms are dominant under different conditions and in principle could be used to distinguish between ionization sources , e.g. , between first stars , for which lyman-@xmath2 pumping is dominant , vs. first mini - quasars for which x - ray photons and therefore heating is dominant ( see e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",

    "the brightness temperature of the cosmological signal used in this study is produced from a dark - matter - only n - body simulation .",
    "this simulation is used to produce a cube of the cosmological signal , i.e. , the density as a function of right ascesion , declination , and redshift ( for more details see * ? ? ? * in preparation ) . although @xmath31 is calculated according to eq .",
    "[ eq : tspin ] , we assume that @xmath32 .",
    "the reason for this assumption is that towards the redshifts of interest for the experiment ( @xmath33612 ) , the abundance of ly@xmath2 photons in the universe is sufficient to couple @xmath34 to @xmath35 which is obviously much greater than @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "hence from eq .",
    "[ eq : tbright ] , @xmath36 follows the cosmological density and @xmath37 .",
    "we further assume that along each sight - line the neutral fraction follows the function @xmath38 , where @xmath39 for each pixel ( or line of sight ) is set to @xmath40 and where @xmath41 is the density contrast at redshift 10 .",
    "we used this approach to randomize the reionization histories along different lines of sight while preserving the spatial correlations of the cosmological signals . in principle , this randomization could be drawn out of a gaussian distribution function .",
    "redshift 10 here is an arbitrary choice .",
    "@xmath39 along each line of sight varies in accordance with the cosmological density along that line - of - sight at z=10 and has a variance of unity centred at 8.5 .",
    "[ fig : signal ] shows the signal data cube that we use in order to test our foregrounds filtering procedure .    .",

    "the upper panel shows the differential brightness temperature in a slice along the redshift / frequency direction and another spatial direction .",
    "the lower panel shows the brightness temperature as a function of redshift / frequency along a certain sight line ( the dashed line in the upper panel ) .",
    "the resolution along the frequency direction is @xmath43 .",
    "currently , a number of experiments ( e.g. , lofar , 21cma , mwa and ska ) are being designed to directly measure @xmath44 of the hi 21-cm hyperfine line and probe the physics of the reionization process by observing the neutral fraction of the igm as a function of redshift . in this study , we focus on predictions for lofar , but our conclusions could be easily applied to the other telescopes .    the lofar - eor key project plans to measure the brightness fluctuations in the frequency range of 115190  mhz , corresponding to redshift range 6 - 11.5 with spectral resolution of @xmath45 and angular resolution of about @xmath46  arcmin . a more detailed discription of the lofar array will be given later in the paper when the instrumental effects are discussed ( section  [ sec : inst ] ) .",
    "the galactic foregrounds have three main contributions .",
    "the first and largest component is the galactic diffuse synchrotron emission ( gdse ) , which is the dominant foreground component in the frequency range of the lofar - eor experiment .",
    "the second component is radio synchrotron emission from discrete sources , mostly supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "the third and last component is the free - free radio emission from diffuse ionized gas .",
    "this component is the weakest of the three , yet it still dominates over the cosmological component .",
    "moreover , it has a different spectral dependence , making it very imporant in testing the signal extraction schemes that we have . in this section",
    "we describe how we simulate the contribution of each of these components to the total intensity .",
    "the polarized intensity simulations are described later on .",
    "the gdse originates from the interaction between the free electrons in the interstellar medium and the galactic magnetic field .",
    "therefore the observed gdse intensity as a function of frequency , @xmath7 , depends on the number density of emitting electrons , @xmath47 , and the galactic magnetic field component perpendicular to the line of sight , @xmath48 : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the electron spectral energy distribution power law index @xcite .",
    "the intensity of the synchrotron emission as expressed in terms of the brightness temperature varies with position and frequency and its spectrum is close to a featureless power law @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the brightness temperature spectral index , related to @xmath50 by @xmath53 .",
    "observational data that are relevant to the lofar - eor project are scarce . @xcite",
    "have produced an all sky map of the total intensity of the gsde at low radio frequencies at 150  mhz with 5@xmath54 resolution .",
    "the other galactic survey relevant to the lofar - eor experiment is the 408  mhz survey of @xcite with a resolution of @xmath55 and of @xcite at @xmath56 with @xmath57 resolution . in the @xcite paper",
    "the authors also assume a smooth power law change in the intensity as a function of frequency which they calculate from their 1420  mhz and 408  mhz maps .    at high galactic latitudes the minimum brightness temperature of the gdse is about 20  k at 325  mhz with variations of the order of 2 per cent on scales from 530  arcmin across the sky @xcite .",
    "at the same galactic latitudes , the temperature spectral index @xmath52 of the gdse is about @xmath58 at 100  mhz and steepens towards higher frequencies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , the spectral index gradually changes with position on the sky .",
    "this change appears to be caused by a variation in the spectral index along the line of sight .",
    "an appropriate standard deviation in the power law index , @xmath59 , in the frequency range 100200  mhz appears to be of the order of @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "recent data , collected around a galaxy cluster abell 2255 using the wsrt telescope at 350  mhz , indicate that the rms of the brightness temperature at 3  arcmin resolution could be as low as 0.10.3  k ( pizzo and de bruyn , private communication ) .",
    "if extrapolated to 150  @xmath61 this result implies that the rms in that region could be 12  @xmath62 , which is an order of magnitude smaller than the low resolution data suggest .    for the purpose of this paper",
    "we assume that the gdse as a function of frequency is well approximated by a power law within the limited frequency range of 115180  mhz .",
    "this is a central assumption in our simulation which is consistent with the general trend shown by the available data , namely that the change in the frequency power law index is gradual .",
    "the values we choose for the power law index are based on the high galactic latitude regions in the @xcite and @xcite maps .",
    "the second assumption we make is that both the intensity and power law index of the gdse can be spatially modelled as gaussian random fields ( grfs ) . for the power spectrum of grfs",
    "we assume a power law with 2d index @xmath63 .",
    "the standard deviation of the grfs is normalized to 0.4 , assuming an angular scale corresponding roughly to the field of view ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the value adopted by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the angular power spectrum index @xmath2 , where @xmath65 , @xmath2 varies from @xmath66 to @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the harmonic number .",
    "in contrast to the previous authors @xcite who directly used the angular and frequency power spectrum of the gdse for their analysis , we simulate gdse in four dimensions ( three spatial and one frequency ) , produce maps at each frequency and then do our analysis on them .",
    "the four dimensional realisation approach has the added benefit of enabling us to account for the amplitude and temperature spectral index variations of the gdse along the line of sight ( @xmath69-coordinate ) .",
    "we obtain the final map of the gdse at each frequency , @xmath10 , by integrating the gdse amplitude ( @xmath70 ) along the z - coordinate : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the brightness temperature of the gdse as a function of position and frequency and @xmath73 is a normalization constant .",
    "@xmath70 is dimensionless and at each frequency is defined by power law : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the reference frequency at which the normalisation is done and @xmath76 is the temperature spectral index as a function of 3d position and frequency @xmath10 .",
    "the power law index @xmath52 has a weak frequency dependence , also as a power law .",

    "we have also explored the possibility that @xmath85 and @xmath52 are independent ; this has led to results very similar to the correlated case , and therefore we show only maps in which @xmath85 and @xmath52 are correlated .",
    "2 .   normalize the mean and standard deviation of @xmath77 by integrating along the @xmath69 direction and setting the mean and standard deviation of @xmath86 to match the observations ( the galactic surveys mentioned above ) . in other words we set the integration constant @xmath73 in eq .",

    "the amplitude , @xmath85 , of the gdse is normalized in the way described above to match @xmath89 @xcite , while @xmath52 is normalized at @xmath90 : @xmath91 @xcite .",

    "note that @xmath36 is still a very smooth function of frequency .",
    "supernova remnants are composed of expanding shells that have strong magnetic fields which are able to produce cosmic rays . as the particles escape the expanding shell , their energy decreases due to synchrotron cooling and we detect them at radio frequencies .",

    "however , the signal extraction scheme we apply only to the ` dirty ' maps that have been produced with a uniform uv coverage as a function of frequency and have no noise .",
    "this is due to the additional difficulties introduced by mixing of angular scales in the frequency direction .",
    "those issues will be discussed in a follow - up paper .",
    "in addition to the simulations of the total brightness temperature , the polarized galactic synchrotron emission maps are produced . here ,",
    "we follow a simple model that includes multiple faraday screens along the line of sight ( see figs .  [ fig : iplot ] & [ fig : qplot ] ) .",
    "the motivation behind these simulations is that improper polarization calibration could severely contaminate the eor signal , so future robust extraction algorithms have to take this into account .",
    "[ fig : angps ] shows the angular power spectra of the simulated eor signal ( dotted red line ) , simulated diffuse component of the foregrounds ( solid black line ) and three levels of noise ( blue lines ) at @xmath104 .",
    "the lines are drawn as the best fit to the coresponding points .",
    "the dashed blue line represents the level of the noise ( @xmath120 ) after one year of the lofar - eor experiment ( @xmath121h of total observing time ) with a single beam . for this case of",
    "instrumental noise and inclusion of realistic diffuse foregrounds we have shown that we are able to statistically detect the eor signal despite the small signal to noise ratio . however , the current observing plan of the lofar - eor experiment @xcite is to observe with five independent beams , which reduces the @xmath122 by a factor of @xmath123 ( dashed - dotted blue line ) . after four years of observations ( @xmath124h ) with five beams",
    "the @xmath122 is reduced by a factor of @xmath125 ( dashed - dotted - dotted blue line ) , which means that the signal to noise ratio is roughly 0.5 .",
    "finally we would like to emphasize that this paper is just a first step in testing and developing the analysis tools for the lofar - eor experiment .",
    "future papers will use the foregrounds simulations developed in this paper together with simulations of the eor signal ( * ? ? ? * in prep . ) , instrumental response ( * ? ? ? * in prep . ) , and other non - astrophysical effects ( e.g. ionosphere , rfis , ... ) in order to test all aspects of the pipeline in the lofar - eor experiment .",

    "<S> future high redshift 21-cm experiments will suffer from a high degree of contamination , due both to astrophysical foregrounds and to non - astrophysical and instrumental effects . in order to reliably extract the cosmological signal from the observed data , it is essential to understand very well all data components and their influence on the extracted signal . </S>",
    "<S> here we present simulated astrophysical foregrounds datacubes and discuss their possible statistical effects on the data . </S>",
    "<S> the foreground maps are produced assuming @xmath0 windows that match those expected to be observed by the lofar epoch - of - reionization ( eor ) key science project . </S>",
    "<S> we show that with the expected lofar - eor sky and receiver noise levels , which amount to @xmath1 at 150  mhz after 400 hours of total observing time , a simple polynomial fit allows a statistical reconstruction of the signal . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the polynomial fitting will work for maps with realistic yet idealised instrument response , i.e. , a response that includes only a uniform uv coverage as a function of frequency and ignores many other uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> polarized galactic synchrotron maps that include internal polarization and a number of faraday screens along the line of sight are also simulated . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of these stems from the fact that the lofar instrument , in common with all current interferometric eor experiments has an instrumentally polarized response .    </S>",
