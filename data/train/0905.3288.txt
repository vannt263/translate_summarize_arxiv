    "most plant cells grow by uniaxial expansion .",
    "establishing and maintaining this characteristic anisotropic growth mode requires regulatory mechanisms that are robust , and , in addition , sensitive to the cell geometry . a major role in this process",
    "is played by microtubules , highly dynamic filamentous protein aggregates that form one of the components of the cytoskeleton of all eukaryotic organisms ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , chapter 16 ) . in growing plant cells microtubules",
    "are confined to a thin layer of cytoplasm just inside the cell plasma membrane . here",
    "they form the so - called cortical array , an ordered structure formed by highly aligned ( bundles of ) microtubules oriented transversely to the growth direction @xcite .",
    "this structure is unique to plant cells and there is evidence that it controls the direction of cell expansion by guiding the mobile transmembrane protein complexes that deposit long cellulose microfibrils in the plant cell wall @xcite .",
    "these cellulose microfibrils are the main structural elements of the cell wall , which , for mechanical reasons , are also transversely oriented to the cell axis in growing cells @xcite .",
    "an _ in vivo _ image of the array and a schematic are shown in figure  [ fig_jan_ca ] .",
    "( a ) fluorescently labelled microtubules in a tobacco by-2 cell expressing gfp : tua6 .",

    "( b ) schematic representation of a plant cell cortical array . ]    _ in vivo _ imaging of microtubules labelled with fluorescent proteins in plant cells by several groups has shown how the cortical array is established both following cell division and after microtubule depolymerizing drug ( oryzalin ) treatment @xcite . in these studies microtubules are seen to nucleate at the cortex and then develop from an initially disorganized state into the transverse ordered array over a time period on the order of one hour .",
    "the nature of the self - organization process by which the specific spatial and orientational patterning of this cytoskeletal structure is achieved is as yet only partially understood and forms the subject of this work .",
    "an important aspect of the problem is the nature of localization of the microtubules to the cortical region .",
    "fluorescence recovery after photo - bleaching ( frap ) experiments by shaw et al.@xcite showed that the microtubules are fixed in space , so any apparent mobility of microtubules is due to ` treadmilling ' , the process of simultaneous polymerization at one end and depolymerization at the other end .",
    "so , cortical microtubules do not translate or rotate as a whole .",
    "the same authors also did not detect detachment or ( re)attachment of microtubules to the cell cortex , apart from some growing ends of single microtubules moving out of focus and found no evidence for motors working in the cortical array .",
    "these experiments indicate that the microtubules in the cortical array are fixed to the inside of the cell membrane .",
    "electron microscopy has also shown cross - bridges between cortical microtubules and the membrane @xcite .",
    "it is therefore widely assumed that there are linker proteins that anchor the microtubules through the plasma membrane to the rigid cell wall , although their molecular identity is under debate @xcite .",
    "since the cortical microtubules are effectively confined to a 2d surface , they can interact through ` collisions ' that occur when the polymerizing tip of a growing microtubule encounters a pre - existing microtubule .",
    "the resulting dynamical interaction events were first characterized by dixit and cyr @xcite in tobacco bright yellow-2 ( by-2 ) cells .",
    "they observed three different possible outcomes : ( i ) _ zippering _ : a growing microtubule bending towards the direction of the microtubule encountered , which occurs only when the angle of incidence is relatively small ( @xmath0 ) ( ii ) _ induced catastrophe _ : an initially growing microtubule switching to a shrinking state and retracting after the collision , an effect predominant at larger angles of incidence and ( iii ) _ cross - over _ : a growing microtubule ` slipping over ' the one encountered and continuing to grow in its original direction .",
    "there are clearly many coupled mechanisms at work in this complex biological system contributing to the assembly and maintenance of this microtubule cortical array structure .",
    "we are interested in understanding what are the main contributing factors and how their interplay leads to the observed orientational ordering . with this aim",
    "we develop a coarse - grained model , incorporating all the effects discussed above .",
    "our emphasis on the plant - specific biological mechanism of the ordering in the cortical array distinguishes our approach from earlier work .    over the years",
    ", various models for self - organization of cytoskeletal filaments ( and polar rods in general ) have been proposed @xcite , and the model by zumdieck et al .",
    "@xcite was applied to the plant cortex .",
    "however , in each of these models the filaments are assumed to have rotational and , in most cases , translational degrees of freedom .",
    "this is inconsistent with the fact that the plant cortical microtubules are stably anchored .",
    "inspired by the experimental results of dixit and cyr @xcite , baulin et al .",
    "@xcite were the first to report on a two dimensional dynamical system of treadmilling and colliding microtubules .",
    "their focus was on establishing the minimal interactions needed to generate dynamical alignment .",
    "using stochastic simulations they showed that a pausing mechanism , whereby a growing microtubule stalls against another microtubule until the latter moves away , can indeed lead to ordering .",
    "stalling , however , is not often observed in the cortical array .",
    "moreover their model lacks dynamic instabilities , i.e. catastrophes , both spontaneous and induced , and rescues , and employs a form of deterministic microtubule motion , which is arguably unrealistic in view of the observed dynamics .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we formulate our course - grained model starting from a description of the dynamics of individual microtubules .",
    "we then construct the continuity equations that couple the densities of growing , shrinking and inactive microtubule segments due to the intrinsic and collisional dynamics . in the steady state",
    "we can reduce the initial set of equations to four coupled non - linear integral equations .",
    "we then perform a dimensional analysis to identify the relevant control parameter of the system . in section",
    "iii we present the results of our model .",
    "we first solve the model analytically in the isotropic stationary state . using a bifurcation analysis",
    "we then determine the critical values of the control parameter at which the system develops ordered solutions .",
    "we interpret these results in terms of the physical parameters of microtubule segment length and mesh size .",
    "finally , we formulate a minimal model with realistic interaction parameters that we can solve numerically to obtain all stationary ordered solutions .",
    "we close by giving arguments for the stability of these solutions .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion section .",
    "an appendix outlines further details of the numerical solution technique employed .",
    "schematic representation of the model interaction .",
    "the microtubule of interest is drawn in black and other microtubules that it encounters are in grey .",
    "the active segments of the black microtubule have an arrow head indicating growth or shrinkage whereas inactive segments end in the junction with the following segment depicted by a dot .",
    "see also the description of the parameters in table [ tab : notationdim ] . ]    as described in the introduction we confine the configuration of the microtubules to a 2d plane .",
    "since collision - induced zippering events can cause microtubules to bend along the direction of preexisting ones , we divide each microtubule into distinct segments with a fixed orientation .",
    "we treat these segments as straight rigid rods .",
    "this is justifiable since the persistence length @xmath1 of microtubules is long ( @xmath2 ) compared to the average length of a microtubule ( @xmath3 ) and , as mentioned above , adhesion to the plasma membrane further inhibits thermal motion .",
    "microtubules are known to be dynamic in that they are continually growing or shrinking by ( de)polymerization .",
    "we use the standard two - state dynamic instability model of dogterom and leibler @xcite which assumes that each microtubule has a ` plus ' end , located on the final segment of each microtubule , that is either growing ( labelled by @xmath4 ) with speed @xmath5 or shrinking ( labelled by @xmath6 ) with speed @xmath7 .",
    "this plus end can switch stochastically from growing to shrinking ( a so - called ` catastrophe ' ) with rate @xmath8 , or from shrinking to growing ( a so - called ` rescue ' ) with rate @xmath9 in a process known as dynamic instability .",
    "we model the creation of new microtubules with a constant , homogeneous , isotropic nucleation rate @xmath10 in the plane of the 2d model . _ in vivo _",
    "nucleation appears to occur at the cortex and has been observed to occur in random orientations unattached to pre - existing microtubules @xcite .",
    "although microtubules have also been observed to nucleate from by @xmath11-tubulin complexes binding to pre - existing microtubules @xcite we ignore this possibility for simplicity s sake . by the same token we disregard the possibility of the shrinking of microtubules at their less active minus  end , leading to motion through the ` treadmilling ' mechanism @xcite .",
    "the initial segment of each microtubule therefore remains attached to the nucleation point in our model .",
    "we call the final segment of a microtubule , which contains the growing or shrinking tip , _ active _ and all the remaining ones , which do not change their length , _ inactive _ ( labelled by @xmath12 ) .",
    "a cartoon of an an individual microtubule according to these definitions is depicted in figure  [ fig : mtsegs ] .",
    "when a microtubule collides with another microtubule and experiences a zippering event , its active segment is converted into an inactive segment , and a new active segment is created alongside the encountered microtubule .",
    "the inverse can also occur : if the active segment shrinks to zero length , a previously inactive segment in another direction can be reactivated .",
    "an induced catastrophe event simply causes the growing active segment to become a shrinking one , as is the case for spontaneous catastrophes . finally , a crossover results in the growing active segment continuing to grow unperturbed .",
    "in figure [ fig : int ] we present the relative probabilities for zippering , induced catastrophes and crossovers as a result of collisions between microtubules , based on the data provided by dixit and cyr @xcite .",
    "we assume that there are no microtubule polarity effects , as they were not reported .",
    "the probabilities @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 for zippering , cross - overs and induced catastrophes respectively are therefore even functions of the angle difference @xmath16 defined by their values on the interval @xmath17 $ ] . in this article",
    "we will use only the following minimal set of properties , which are qualitatively supported by the data .",
    "firstly , zippering becomes less likely for increasing angle of incidence , and is effectively zero at @xmath18 , which is reasonable as the energy associated with bending the microtubule increases with angle .",
    "secondly , the probability for induced catastrophes monotonically increases with increasing angle of incidence , reaching a maximum at @xmath19 , consistent with observations that indicate that a microtubule which is hindered in its growth will undergo a catastrophe at a rate that depends inversely on its growth speed @xcite .",
    "probabilities for zippering , cross - overs and catastrophes as deduced from the observations of @xcite ( combined data from mbd - dsred and yfp - tua6 labelling ) .",
    "light grey shaded region : fraction of zippering events .",
    "dark grey shaded region : fraction of induced catastrophes .",
    "white region : fraction of crossovers .",
    "every data point is located at the centre of the corresponding bin , and the shaded regions have been extended to the boundaries using horizontal lines .",
    "the corresponding lowest order fourier coefficients of the interaction functions are : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( computed using numerical integration of the product of @xmath23 and a piecewise linear interpolation of the data ) . ]      [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     since there are many ( @xmath24 - @xmath25 ) microtubules , each of which can have multiple segments , in the cortical array of a typical interphase plant cell we treat the system using a coarse - grained description . in this approach , instead of individual microtubules",
    ", we consider local densities of microtubule segments . this approximation is reasonable",
    "as long as the length scale of an individual microtubule segment is small compared to the linear dimensions of the cell . from the outset",
    "we assume that the system is ( and remains ) spatially homogeneous , and we will eventually restrict ourselves to the steady - state solutions . in order to deal with the memory effect caused by the isotropic nucleation , followed by subsequent reorienting zippering events",
    ", we need to keep track of the segment number @xmath26 , which starts at @xmath27 for the segments connected to their nucleation site and increases by unity at each zippering event .",
    "our fundamental variables are therefore the areal number densities @xmath28 of segments in state @xmath29 with segment number @xmath26 having length @xmath30 and orientation @xmath31 ( measured from an arbitrary axis ) at time @xmath32 these densities obey a set of master equations that can symbolically be written as    [ eq : meall ] @xmath33    the flux terms @xmath34 couple the equations for the growing , shrinking and inactive segments and between different values of @xmath26 .",
    "equations must be supplemented by a set of boundary conditions for the growing segments at @xmath35 . for the initial segment ( @xmath36 )",
    "this reflects the isotropic nucleation of new microtubules , given by @xmath37 where @xmath10 is nucleation rate .",
    "for the subsequent segments @xmath38 , this ` nucleation ' of growing segments is the result of the zippering of segments with index @xmath39 . defining @xmath40 as the flux of @xmath26-segments with angle @xmath41 and length @xmath42 zippering into angle @xmath43 at time @xmath44 (",
    "this will be made explicit in equation ) , we obtain the boundary condition @xmath45 generally , this leads to a qualitatively different boundary condition for every value of @xmath26 .",
    "the model therefore consists of an infinite set of coupled equations , three for every value of @xmath26 .",
    "however , in section [ sec : steady ] we will show that in the steady state , this can be reduced to a finite set by summing over all segment indices @xmath26 . in the following ,",
    "we derive explicit expressions for each of the flux terms @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath49 in equation corresponds to the length increase of the growing segments . for segment growth in isolation , the length increase in a small time interval @xmath50",
    "is given by @xmath51 where @xmath5 is the growth velocity , and we have @xmath52 . by expanding the left hand term to",

    "so far , we have described the first three terms of equations and ( growth , shrinkage and dynamic instability terms ) .",
    "together , these fully describe a system of non - interacting microtubules , in which also the boundary condition vanishes due to the absence of zippering . in this special case",
    "we recover the well - known equations introduced by dogterom and leibler @xcite ( for @xmath36 ) .",
    "an interaction can occur when a growing active microtubule segment collides with another segment , irrespective of the latter s state and length .",
    "this prompts the definition of the total length density @xmath63 of all microtubule segments in direction @xmath31 at time @xmath44 , given by : @xmath64 the density of collisions of a microtubule segment growing in direction @xmath31 with other segments in direction @xmath65 is determined by the geometrical projection @xmath66 where the presence of the @xmath67 factor ensures the correct geometrical weighting reflecting the fact that parallel segments do not collide .",
    "when a collision occurs , one of the three possible events , induced catastrophe @xmath68 zippering @xmath69 or cross - over @xmath70 occurs , with probabilities @xmath71 @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",

    "the reactivation term @xmath80 corresponds to the flux of active microtubule segments , with segment number @xmath81 that , by shrinking to length zero , reactivate a previously inactive segment , effectively undoing a past zippering event and so create a new , shrinking , active segment with segment number @xmath82 the incoming flux of of such segments coming from a given direction @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 .",
    "the reactivation flux is given by @xmath85 where the unzippering  distribution@xmath86 gives the probability that the shrinking microtubule reactivates an inactive segment with orientation @xmath87 and length @xmath88 .",
    "this distribution will be determined below .",
    "a microtubule that has zippered will take a certain amount of time @xmath89 to undergo a catastrophe and return to the zippering location , where @xmath89 is a stochastic variable . the unzipppering flux from direction @xmath43 at time @xmath44 consists of microtubules that had zippered at a range of times @xmath90 and have now returned to the zippering location .",
    "this implicitly defines an _ originating time _",
    "distribution @xmath91 for the returning microtubules .",
    "furthermore , because the evolution of a microtubule between the zippering event and its return to the same location does not depend on the previous segments , the segment that is re - activated by a microtubule returning to the zippering position after a time @xmath89 should be selected proportional to the ` forward ' zippering flux at time @xmath92 .",
    "the forward flux @xmath93 of microtubules with length @xmath42 and angle @xmath41 zippering into angle @xmath43 is defined in accordance with equation as @xmath94 at each of the originating times @xmath90 , the distribution of microtubules that zipper into the direction @xmath43 with length @xmath88 and orientation @xmath87 is given by @xmath95 the probability distributions @xmath96 can be combined to determine the unzippering distribution @xmath97where we assume the system evolved from an initial condition at @xmath98 in which no microtubules were present .",
    "clearly all the complicated history dependence of the system is hidden in the originating time distribution . however , in the steady state situation we consider below , the time - dependence drops out and the details of this distribution become irrelevant .",

    "this , in combination with the results ( [ eq : balance ] ) , ( [ eq : expl ] ) and ( [ eq : ssnuci ] ) , yields the identity with @xmath117 we therefore need an independent argument to fix the densities of the inactive segments . to obtain this",

    "we restrict ourselves to the analysis of the first bifurcation point and the corresponding ordered solution branch . because the solutions on this branch already have the lowest symmetry permitted by the interaction functions , there are no further bifurcation points along this branch .",
    "generically @xcite , the branches of the initial pitchfork bifurcation are stable for a supercritical bifurcation ( branches bending towards higher values of @xmath157 ) and unstable for a subcritical bifurcation ( branches bending towards lower values of @xmath157 ) .",
    "in addition , turning points in the bifurcating branches generally correspond to an exchange of stability @xcite .",
    "this analysis allows us to assign stability indicators to the bifurcation diagrams in figure [ fig : results-1 ] , even in the absence of a detailed study of the time - dependent equations .",
    "based on biological observations , we have constructed a model for the orientational alignment of cortical microtubules .",
    "the model has a number of striking features .",
    "first of all , for a given set of induced catastrophe and zippering probabilities ( @xmath220 and @xmath267 ) , it allows us to identify a single dimensionless control parameter @xmath157 , which is fully determined by the nucleation rate and intrinsic dynamics of individual microtubules .",
    "this result by itself may turn out to be very useful in comparing different _ in vivo _ systems or the same system under different conditions or in different developmental stages . for increasing values of @xmath157 ,",
    "the isotropic stationary solutions to the model show an increase both in density and in abundance of interactions , as measured by the ratio of microtubule length to the mesh - size . secondly , the bifurcation point , i.e. the critical value of @xmath268 of the control parameter at which the system develops ordered stationary solutions from the isotropic state , is determined solely by the probability of collisions between microtubules that lead to an induced catastrophe .    indeed , from the numerical solutions of the minimal model introduced in section [ sec : minimalmodel ] it appears , perhaps surprisingly , that the co - alignment of microtubules due to zippering events , if anything , diminishes the degree of order .",
    "these results identify the `` weeding out '' of misaligned microtubules  by marking them for early removal by the induced switch to the shrinking state  as the driving force for the ordering process . finally , in spite of not being able to directly assess the stability of the solutions in the time - domain , we have provided arguments that stable ordered solutions are possible for the regime @xmath156 , i.e. where the length of individual microtubules is intrinsically bounded .    for @xmath269 ,",
    "individual microtubules have the tendency to grow unbounded , unless they are kept in check by catastrophic collisions .",
    "although ( locally ) stable solutions may exist for values of @xmath157 that are not too large , for every @xmath269 there exists a class of aligned ` runaway ' solutions with diverging densities .",
    "the computed ordered solutions , regardless of their stability , converge to a point with @xmath197 , for which the microtubules are perfectly aligned ( @xmath270 ) and the system is infinitely dense .",
    "the existence of this point can be understood by the fact that the alignment also serves to decrease the number of collisions , and in the limit of a perfectly aligned system , the ( relative ) number of collisions vanishes .",
    "how realistic is the model presented ? to answer this question we need to consider several known factors that have not been included .",
    "first of all , microtubules typically can de - attach from their nucleation sites and then perform so called treadmilling motion , whereby the minus - end shrinks at a more or less steady pace , which is small compared to both the growth- and the shrinking speed of the more active plus end . in the case that no zippering occurs at all it is relatively easy to show that the effect of treadmilling simply leads to a renormalization of the parameter @xmath157 and the interaction functions @xmath167 and @xmath168 , but leaving the qualitative behaviour of the model identical to the one discussed here .",
    "when zippering does occur , one expects the treadmilling to enhance the degree of ordering in an ordered state , as over time it `` eats - up '' the , by definition less ordered , initial segments of each microtubule .",
    "this effect is also consistent with the observation in figure 5c that in the case with zippering the active tips are on average more strongly aligned than the average segment .",
    "in fact , given that the comparison between figures [ fig : results-2]b and [ fig : results-2]c also shows that , all else being equal , zippering sharpens the orientational distribution of the active tips as compared to the case with no zippering , it is conceivable that the combination of zippering and treadmilling could lead to more strongly ordered systems for the same value of the control parameter .    next it is known that in vivo severing proteins , such as katanin are active in , and crucial to , the formation of the cortical array @xcite .",
    "although in principle the effect of severing proteins could be included in the model , it would present formidable problems in the analysis as well as introduce additional parameters into the model for which precise data is lacking .",
    "another effect that has not been taken into account explicitly is microtubule bundling . whenever a microtubule zippers alongside another segment , they form a parallel bundle @xcite",
    ". however , the coarse - grained nature of our model precludes the formation of bundles and only allows for alignment of the segments .",
    "this means that a microtubule that is growing in a different direction encounters each microtubule separately rather than as a single bundle .",
    "it is to be expected that the catastrophe and zippering rates stemming from @xmath271 individual collisions will be higher than those from a single collision with a bundle of @xmath271 microtubules .",
    "hence , in realistic systems the event rate is likely to be lower than that predicted by the model , or , in other words , corresponds to a lower value of the scaling parameter @xmath233 .",
    "bundles are also thought to be more than just adjacently aligned microtubules , because they may be stabilized through association with bundling proteins that could potentially decrease the catastrophe rate of individual microtubules within a bundle ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is a non - trivial effect that should be considered separately and is likely to lead to an increased tendency to form an ordered structure .",
    "finally , our model implicitly assumes that there is an infinite supply of free tubulin dimers available for incorporation into microtubules .",
    "although there is no definite experimental evidence for this , it is reasonable to assume that _ in vivo _ there is a limit to the size of the free tubulin pool .",
    "such a finite tubulin pool would have marked consequences for the behaviour of the model , because the growth speed , and possibly also the nucleation rate , are dependent on the amount of free tubulin , or equivalently the total density of microtubules @xmath272 .",
    "to a first approximation the growth speed is given by @xmath273 where @xmath274 the maximally attainable density when all tubulin is incorporated into microtubules .",
    "this allows for stable states to develop even when @xmath275 , because under this pool - size constraint the length of individual microtubules will always remain bounded , and the system will settle into a steady state with @xmath276 .",
    "this behaviour could provide a biologically motivated mechanism by which a solution with a particular density is selected .    to see whether our model , in spite of its approximate nature , makes sense in the light of the available data we first use the collision event probabilities obtained by dixit and cyr @xcite ( see figure [ fig : int ] ) to obtain an estimate for the bifurcation value of the control parameter of @xmath277 for the case of tobacco by-2 cells .",
    "an ordered phase of cortical microtubules should therefore be possible provided @xmath278 .",
    "given the available data on the microtubule instability parameters in this same system taken from dhonukshe et al.@xcite and vos et al .",
    "@xcite we would predict using the definition ( [ eq : gdefinition ] ) that this requires the nucleation rate of new microtubules to be larger than 0.05 min@xmath279m@xmath280 ( dhonukse ) and 0.01 min@xmath279 m@xmath280 ( vos ) respectively .",
    "both these estimates for a lower bound on the nucleation rate are reasonable as they imply the nucleation of order @xmath281 microtubules in the whole cortex over the course of the build - up towards full transverse order , comparable to the number that is observed .",
    "finally , we should point out that our model so far only addresses the question of what causes cortical microtubules to align with respect to each other .",
    "given that in growing plant cells the cortical array is invariably oriented transverse to the growth direction , the question of what determines the direction of the alignment axis with respect to the cell axes is as , if not more , important from a biological perspective .",
    "we hope to address this question , as well as the influence of some of the as yet neglected factors mentioned above , in future work .",
