    "along with the galactic center and galaxy clusters , the dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsph ) of the milky way have been identified as promising targets for indirect dark matter ( dm ) searches ( see e.g. @xcite ) . their low astrophysical background , high mass - to - light ratio , and proximity make them compelling targets @xcite .",
    "about twenty - five galactic dsphs were known as of early 2015 , and their observation by @xmath1-ray telescopes has thus far shown no significant emission , leading to stringent constraints on @xmath2 , the thermally - averaged dm annihilation cross - section @xcite .",
    "recently , imaging data from the dark energy survey has led to the discovery of nine new potential milky - way satellites in the southern sky @xcite .",
    "the nearest object , reticulum  ii ( ret  ii , @xmath3 kpc ) , is particularly intriguing , as evidence of @xmath1-ray emission has been detected in its direction using the public fermi - lat pass 7 data .",
    "@xcite determined the probability of background processes producing the observed ret  ii gamma - ray signal to be between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , depending on the background modelling .",
    "an analysis of the new objects published simultaneously by @xcite , based on the unreleased pass 8 data set , reported no significant detection , though the strongest hint was for ret  ii with @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite subsequently performed a similar analysis with public pass 7 data , finding a @xmath7 value of @xmath8 .    in any case , a robust determination of ret  ii s dm content is crucial in order to constrain particle nature of dm .",
    "reticulum  ii was found to be a dm - dominated dsph galaxy from the independent chemodynamical analyses of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . here , we reconstruct the dm annihilation and decay emission profiles of ret  ii from a spherical jeans analysis applied to stellar kinematic data obtained with the michigan / magellan fiber system ( m2fs ) @xcite .",
    "we use the optimized jeans analysis setup from @xcite , and compute the astrophysical @xmath0- and @xmath9-factors , for annihilating and decaying dm respectively , from the reconstructed dm density profiles .",
    "we cross - check our results by varying different ingredients of the analysis and evaluate the ranking of ret  ii among the most promising dsphs for dm indirect detection .",

    "this quantity depends on both the extent of the dm halo and the mass density distribution , and is essential for constraining the dm particle properties .",
