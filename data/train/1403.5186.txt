    "when the phase - amplitude ( ph - a ) method was first introduced by milne in 1930 @xcite , and then taken up by many authors , see ref .",
    "@xcite , the main motivation was the paucity of numerical mesh points required , compared to the calculation of the wave function itself .",
    "this is because both phase and amplitude functions are monotonic and slowly varying , as opposed to the wave function itself that can be highly oscillatory .",
    "this point was verified by many authors , in particular by calogero and ravenhall @xcite who state that the solution for the phase is more stable than the solution of the wave function . an additional argument in favor of the (",
    "ph - a ) representation is that it lends itself to analytic expressions to address particular problems .",
    "for example , the ph - a representation facilitates the incorporation of the effect of long range potentials @xcite , @xcite  or the calculation of resonances @xcite .",
    "it is also helpful in the quantum defect calculation of atomic wave functions @xcite , the calculation of gaunt factors @xcite , as well as the description of an electron with an ion embedded in a plasma @xcite , among others .",
    "the ph - a description of a carrier wave in radio or television also plays a significant rle in the compactification of the signal transmission in the field of information technology .",
    "an additional advantage of the ph - a representation is that it provides a method to improve the wkb approximation of a wave function , an important point since the wkb approximation @xcite has led , over the years , to a much improved understanding of the solution of the schrdinger eq .",
    "the ph - a representation consists in writing a wave function @xmath4 in the form @xmath5 , \\label{y sin}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the amplitude and @xmath7 is the phase , and @xmath8 the distance from the origin .",
    "if an overlap matrix element @xmath9 between two wave functions is required , then in the finite difference method of obtaining integrals , both @xmath10 and @xmath11 have to be calculated on a sufficiently fine mesh , which can be time consuming and prone to errors . however , the ph - a representation can provide an estimate of @xmath12 by decomposing the integrand of the overlap matrix element into a slowly oscillating ( s )  and a fast oscillating ( f ) part@xmath13 the decomposition makes use of a trigonometric identity for the product of two sine functions with the result@xmath14dr . \\label{if",
    "is}\\ ] ] the matrix element @xmath15 can be calculated on a small set of radial mesh points since the integrand oscillates slowly .",
    "further , since @xmath16 a rough estimate for @xmath12 is provided by @xmath15 alone . here @xmath17 is an overlap function that depends on the physics application envisaged .    in 1962",
    "seaton and peach @xcite presented an iterative scheme to solve milne s non - linear differential equation @xcite for the amplitude and phase .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to implement this iterative method by means of a spectral @xcite expansion of the amplitude in terms of chebyshev polynomials .",
    "a further purpose is to examine the accuracy of the resulting ph - a wave function by comparison with the direct solution of the schrdinger equation for the wave function , the latter also obtained by an accurate spectral integral equation method @xcite , denoted as @xmath18 in what follows .",
    "the combination of both objectives have not been presented previously .",
    "the great advantage of a spectral expansion is that the calculations utilize all the support points located in a given partition simultaneously , with the result that the errors are shared uniformly across the partition in the case of chebyshev expansions @xcite . for the present numerical examples the calculation is done in one great radial partition , extending from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , containing @xmath21 chebyshev support points . by contrast , other algorithms ( such as finite elements , finite differences , or the @xmath18 method described below ) have to divide such a large radial interval into a number of partitions , with the result that the error from one partition is propagated into the adjoining one , the last partition having the largest error @xcite .",
    "in addition , for calculations that require  the storage of many wave functions with high precision @xcite  the use of the ph - a representation can be very advantageous because the amount of storage required can be substantially smaller than what is needed for other algorithms .    in section ii the iterative method",
    "is explained , section iii contains details of the computational spectral method , section iv presents the results , including error estimates and suggestions for improvements , and finally the summary and conclusions are presented in section v.",

    "the driving term of this equation  is the known right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ siter ] ) , which is also expanded in terms of chebyshev polynomials .",
    "since the chebyshev polynomials are defined in the interval @xmath45 the quantities defined in the radial interval @xmath46 are mapped into the @xmath47variable by a linear transformation . according to the spectral methods the @xmath48- mesh points are the @xmath40 zeros of @xmath49 .",
    "the expansion cutoff value @xmath50 is set arbitrarily , but once chosen , the location and number of support points on the @xmath47axis is determined .",
    "extensive use is made of the clenshaw - curtis matrix method ( cc ) @xcite that relates the values of a function evaluated at the @xmath40 mesh - points to the expansion coefficients @xmath44 of that function , and vice - versa , by a simple known matrix @xcite relation .",
