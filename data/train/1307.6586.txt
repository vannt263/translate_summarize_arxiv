    "furthermore , modeling of multi - wavelength afterglow data allows us to constrain the densities and structure of massive star environments on parsec scales , as well as the energies of the explosions and the degree of ejecta collimation .    to use grbs as effective probes of star - formation in the re - ionization era ( @xmath10 ; @xcite ) ,",
    "it is important to understand whether there is any evolution in the properties of their progenitors with redshift .",

    "the uncertainties are statistical only and do not include the systematic uncertainties introduced by the interpolation , which are less than @xmath108 .    after obtaining nir fluxes at a common time ,",
    "we build a composite model for the afterglow sed .",
    "we use a sight - line - averaged model for the optical depth of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) as described by @xcite , accounting for ly@xmath72 absorption by neutral hydrogen along the line of sight and photoelectric absorption by intervening systems .",
    "we also include ly@xmath72 absorption by the host galaxy , for which we assume a column of @xmath109 , the mean value for grbs at @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the free parameters in our model are the redshift of the grb , the extinction along the line of sight within the host galaxy ( @xmath110 ) , and the spectral index ( @xmath111 ) of the afterglow sed , @xmath112 . in order to not bias our results , we assume a flat prior for the redshift and the extinction .",
    "we further use the distribution of extinction - corrected spectral slopes , @xmath113 from @xcite as a prior on @xmath111 .",
    "we use a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm to explore the parameter space , integrating the model over the filter bandpasses and computing the likelihood of the model by comparing the resulting fluxes with the observed values .",
    "details of our mcmc implementation are described in section [ text : mcmc ] .",
    "we find @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 mag , where the uncertainties correspond to @xmath49 credible intervals about the median .",
    "the parameters of the highest - likelihood model are @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119mag , consistent with the @xmath49 credible intervals derived from the posterior density functions ( table [ tab:120521c_sedfit ] ) .",
    "we note that the median values differ from the highest - likelihood values .",
    "this is a standard feature of monte carlo analyses whenever the likelihood function is asymmetric about the highest - likelihood point . in this case , this occurs because the extinction is constrained to be positive , resulting in a truncation of parameter space .",
    "the best - fit model and a model with the median parameters are plotted in figure [ fig:120521c_photoz ] , while the full posterior density function for the redshift is shown in figure [ fig:120521c_zhists ] .",
    "we can rule out a redshift of @xmath120 at @xmath121 confidence . the corresponding 99.7% confidence upper limit is @xmath122 .",
    "we note that this constraint on the redshift relies on the assumed prior for @xmath111 . using broad - band modeling",
    "we can locate the synchrotron break frequencies ( explained in the next section ) and thereby constrain @xmath111 independent of the redshift .",
    "therefore , in the subsequent multi - wavelength modeling we leave the redshift as a free parameter and fit for it along with the parameters of the explosion . for the optical and nir frequencies , we integrate the model over the filter bandpasses to take into account absorption by the intervening igm and the ism of the host galaxy .",
    "in the standard synchrotron model of grb afterglows , the spectral energy distribution consists of multiple power - law segments delineated by ` break - frequencies ' , namely the synchrotron cooling frequency ( @xmath123 ) , the typical synchrotron frequency ( @xmath124 ) , and the self - absorption frequency ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "the location and evolution of these break frequencies , and the overall normalization of the spectrum depend upon the physical parameters of the explosion : the energy ( @xmath126 ) , the circumburst density ( @xmath127 , or the normalized mass - loss rate in a wind environment , @xmath128 ) , the power - law index of the electron energy distribution ( @xmath129 ) , the fraction of the blastwave energy transferred to relativistic electrons ( @xmath130 ) and to the magnetic fields ( @xmath131 ) , and the half - angle of the collimated outflow ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "for further details of the synchrotron model , see @xcite .",
    "we have developed python software for broad - band modeling of grb afterglows .",
    "our software implements the full afterglow model with smoothly - connected power law segments presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth gs02 ) .",
    "the model includes synchrotron cooling and self - absorption for both ism and wind - like environments .",
    "the full treatment of the synchrotron model including local electron cooling results in five different spectral regimes with 11 definitions of the break frequencies , corresponding to different orderings of the synchrotron frequencies . depending on the circumburst density profile and the combination of physical parameters",
    ", the spectrum evolves from fast cooling ( @xmath133 ) to slow cooling ( @xmath134 ) , transitioning through the various spectral regimes ( figure 2 in gs02 ) .",
    "given a set of explosion parameters , we compute the location of each of the 11 break frequencies using the expressions in gs02 .",
    "owing to slightly different normalizations of the break frequencies between the five spectral regimes , a sharp transition from one spectrum to another sometimes introduces discontinuities in the light curves .",
    "this is exacerbated by the fact that the transition times between spectra are not uniquely defined ( see table 3 in gs02 ) . to overcome this and to establish a consistent framework , we add a linear combination of all spectra through which the spectrum evolves for a given set of physical parameters , with time - dependent weights .",
    "these weights are chosen such that each spectrum dominates in its own regime of validity , while allowing for the light curves to remain smooth when break frequencies cross each other at spectral transitions .",
    "a detailed description of our weighting scheme is provided in appendix [ text : weights ] .",
    "the hydrodynamics presented in gs02 assume spherical expansion . while this is a good approximation in the early phase of the afterglow evolution when the lorentz factor of the ejecta is @xmath135 and only a small fraction of the jet is visible to an observer on earth , deceleration of the jet to @xmath136 results in a steep decline in the observed flux density at all frequencies at later times .",
    "we account for this ` jet break ' by changing the evolution of the break frequencies after the break time , @xmath137 , using the prescription in @xcite , smoothing over the transition with a smoothing parameter for the jet break , the precise value having negligible impact on derived physical parameters . ]",
    "( for further discussion of the jet break based on numerical simulations , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "our software also accounts for possible contributions in the optical and nir from the host galaxy , as well as absorption and reddening of the afterglow light by dust in the host . for the former",
    ", we add the contribution of the host to the model afterglow light curve and fit for the flux density of the host in each waveband separately .",
    "for the latter , we use the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) extinction curve from @xcite and fit for the @xmath138-band extinction in the rest frame of the host galaxy .",
    "we use the optical @xmath138-band rather than @xmath139-band to normalize our model , since the extinction curves of @xcite are normalized in @xmath138-band .",
    "we find that using a large magellanic cloud extinction model does not significantly affect the derived value of @xmath140 and we therefore use the smc model throughout for consistency .",
    "we convert @xmath140 to @xmath110 using @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "radio observations can be strongly affected by scintillation , particularly at low frequencies ( below @xmath142ghz ) .",
    "we account for scintillation in our modeling by calculating the modulation index ( the expectation value of the rms fractional change in flux density ) in the direction of the source and adding the expected flux variation in quadrature to the measured uncertainty .",
    "the details of our method are described in appendix [ app : scintillation ] .",
    "we note that several observations , particularly those in the optical / nir , have high signal - to - noise ratios approaching @xmath143 , implying photometry precise to the @xmath144 level .",
    "however , the relative calibration of different instruments is generally not expected to be better than about @xmath145% .",
    "in addition , the synchrotron model is by its nature a simplification of a complex physical process and we therefore can not expect the model to accurately represent the data at the @xmath146 level . to account for this source of systematic uncertainty , we enforce a floor of @xmath55 on the reported uncertainties prior to fitting .    to determine the best - fit model , we compute the likelihood function using a gaussian error model .",
    "the likelihood function for a data set comprised of both detections and non - detections is given by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we determine the best - fit parameters by maximizing the likelihood function using sequential least squares programming tools available in the python scipy package @xcite .      to fully characterize the likelihood function over a broad range of parameter space and to obtain a bayesian estimate for the posterior density function of the free parameters ( leading to estimates for uncertainties in and correlations between the derived parameters ) , we carry out a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analysis using the python - based code emcee  @xcite . by implementing an affine - invariant mcmc ensemble sampler , emcee",
    "works well for both highly - anisotropic distributions , and distributions with localized regions of high likelihood @xcite .",
    "this is especially useful in high - dimensional problems such as the one presented here , where traditional mcmc methods spend large amounts of time exploring regions of parameter space with low likelihoods .",
    "mcmc analyses also allow us to uncover degeneracies in the model parameters , which are present whenever some of the properties of the synchrotron spectrum ( e.g. ,  @xmath125 ) are not well - constrained .",
    "we note that the parameters @xmath130  and @xmath131  are generally not expected to be larger than their equipartition values of @xmath158 .",
    "accordingly , we truncate the priors for these parameters at an upper bound of @xmath158 . in addition , we sometimes find degeneracies in the models that result in large probability mass being placed at extremely high energies @xmath159 and low densities @xmath160 .",
    "to keep the solutions bounded , we restrict the prior on the isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy to @xmath161 .    for our mcmc analysis , we set up between 100 and 10,000 markov chains ( depending on the complexity of the problem ) with parameters tightly clustered around the best - fit parameters determined using least squares minimization .",
    "we run the ensemble sampler until the average likelihood across the chains reaches a stable value and discard the initial period as ` burn - in ' .",
    "we plot the marginalized posterior density for all parameters and check for convergence by verifying that the distributions remain stable over the length of the chain following burn - in . since the distributions frequently exhibit long tails , we employ quantiles ( instead of the mean or mode ) to compute summary statistics and quote @xmath49 credible regions around the median .",
    "we also provide the values of the parameters corresponding to the highest likelihood ( `` best - fit '' ) solution for completeness . however , the parameter values comprising the `` best - fit '' solution need not ( and frequently do not ) individually correspond to the modes of their respective marginal probability density functions .",
    "we employ the model and fitting algorithm described in section [ text : modelling ] to determine the properties of grb  120521c .",
    "the x - ray light curve displays a steep decline before @xmath162d , followed by a plateau phase extending to 0.25d , neither of which can be described by the standard paradigm of the blandford - mckee model @xcite .",
    "such behavior is ubiquitous in the x - ray light curves of grbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is usually attributed to the high - latitude component of the prompt emission ( @xcite ) and energy injection ( @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "the models we employ only account for the emission from the afterglow blastwave shock , and we therefore only utilize x - ray data after 0.25d in the broad - band fit .    in addition , the @xmath58-band light curve exhibits a peak at @xmath163hr . with a flux density of @xmath164jy .",
    "if we interpret this peak as the passage of @xmath124  through the @xmath58-band , then @xmath124  should pass through 21.8ghz at @xmath165d ( evolving as @xmath166 , before a jet break ) or at the very earliest around @xmath167days ( evolving as @xmath168 , if we assume that a jet break occurred at @xmath169 hours ) .",

    "we now return to the peak in the @xmath58-band light curve at @xmath228hr , which can not be explained by the passage of the synchrotron peak frequency ( see section [ text : results ] ) .",
    "one possible explanation for this peak is that the blastwave encounters a density jump , causing a long - lasting optical flare .",
    "@xcite showed that the greatest change expected in an optical light curve due to a density jump is bounded at @xmath229 ( see also @xcite ) , whereas the temporal behavior of the @xmath58-band flux density indicates a change of @xmath230 .",
    "hence , the @xmath58-band light curve is unlikely to be the result of an inhomogeneous external medium .    another way to suppress the @xmath58-band flux before 8hr is through absorption by neutral hydrogen in the vicinity of the progenitor .",
    "this is an attractive explanation in this case because the @xmath58-band straddles the lyman break and the flux density in this band is therefore highly sensitive to small variations in the neutral hydrogen column along the line of sight . in particular ,",
    "if the neutral hydrogen column were to decline with time due to destruction by the blastwave or by photo - ionization , it would lead to the observed behavior of the rising @xmath58-band flux density .",
    "our first @xmath58-band detection is at @xmath227min in the rest - frame of the burst , corresponding to a distance of @xmath231au from the progenitor , while the @xmath58-band peak occurs at @xmath232hr in the rest frame , corresponding to a distance of @xmath2338 au .",
    "we find that an additional neutral hydrogen column of @xmath234 at @xmath235 would be sufficient to suppress the first @xmath58-band point to the observed flux level and the ionization of this column would therefore lead to the observed increase in flux . for a path length of @xmath236au",
    ", this column corresponds to a density of @xmath237 or a mass of about @xmath238@xmath239 ( assuming a spherical cloud ) . although the requisite mass is not very large , the inferred density is four orders of magnitude higher than a typical molecular cloud in the milky way @xcite",
    ". thus ionization of a large neutral hydrogen column along the line of sight is a feasible explanation for the rising @xmath58-band light curve only if the densities of molecular clouds at @xmath73 can be much greater than observed locally .",
    "another possible explanation for the initial rise in @xmath58-band is the injection of energy into the blastwave shock by slower - moving relativistic ejecta catching up with the decelerating blastwave . if the injection is rapid enough it could create a rising light curve at @xmath58-band , which would then be expected to break into a fading power - law if @xmath124  is located below @xmath58-band at the end of the injection phase .",
    "energy injection has been frequently invoked to explain the plateau phase of grb x - ray afterglows ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "the x - ray light curve of grb  120521c indeed shows such a plateau at 0.010.25d .    to test whether the x - ray and nir light curves can result from energy injection , we use our ism model as an anchor at @xmath240hr , after which it is the best - fit model to the multi - wavelength data set ( including the @xmath58-band and xrt observations ) .",
    "we then assume a period of energy injection between the start of the x - ray plateau at @xmath241d and @xmath242 and use a simple power - law prescription for the energy as a function of time , @xmath243 where @xmath244 is the total isotropic - equivalent blastwave kinetic energy after energy injection is complete .",
    "we note that the xrt light curve displays a steep decline before the plateau with @xmath245 at 90345s ( figure [ fig:120521c_multimodel_ism ] ) , which can not be explained by the afterglow forward shock and is likely related to the prompt emission ( see also section [ text : results ] ) .",
    "we therefore add an additional power - law component with a fixed slope of @xmath246 to the model x - ray light curve .",
    "we set @xmath247erg using our highest - likelihood model ( values in parentheses in table [ tab : bestfit ] ) and vary @xmath248 , @xmath249 , and @xmath242 to obtain a good match to the x - ray and @xmath58-band light curves .",
    "we find that in general we are able to model either the x - ray plateau or the @xmath58-band rise , but not both .",
    "our best simultaneous match to both light curves is shown in figure [ fig:120521c_enj ] with the parameters , @xmath250s , @xmath251s , and @xmath252 , corresponding to an increase in blastwave kinetic energy by a factor of @xmath253 over this period .",
    "although the resulting light curves do not match perfectly , energy injection provides the most plausible explanation for the @xmath58-band peak .",
    "finally , we note that there is some evidence for ` flickering ' in the form of statistically - significant scatter about the overall @xmath58-band rise ( figure [ fig:120521c_zlcfit ] ) , but the observations do not sample these rapid time - scale flux variations well enough to allow us to comment on the nature or source of the variability .",

    "the behavior of the various spectral power law segments of a synchrotron source as outlined in gs02 is strictly valid only when the various spectral break frequencies are located far apart .",
    "however , the break frequencies evolve as a function of time and can cross , leading to transitions from one spectral shape to another . since the normalizations of the light curves in gs02 was calculated in the asymptotic limit , spectral transitions ( that occur when break frequencies approach each other and cross ) lead to artificial discontinuities in the model light curves .",
    "we smooth over these glitches by adding together weighted combinations of all spectra that are accessible with the specified physical parameters ( see  5 of gs02 ) .",
    "for instance , in the ism model with @xmath127@xmath371@xmath131@xmath372 < 18 , we expect the afterglow to evolve in the order spectrum 5 @xmath373 1 @xmath373 2 .",
    "consequently in this example , we add together a combination of spectra 5 , 1 , and 2 with time - varying weights such that the appropriate spectrum presents the dominant contribution in the corresponding asymptotic limit , whereas at a spectral transition ( defined next ) , the two spectra on either side of the transition contribute equally .    for a transition from spectrum a to spectrum b",
    ", we define the transition time , @xmath374 as the geometric mean of the time when spectrum a ceases to be valid and the time when spectrum b first becomes valid . in the above example with the spectra evolving in the order 5 @xmath373 1 @xmath373 2 , there are two transition times , denoted as @xmath375 and @xmath376 , respectively .",
    "next , we construct weighting functions for each spectrum as follows .",
    "if a spectrum is valid in the range @xmath377 $ ] ( such as spectrum 5 in the example above ) , the weighting function ( @xmath378 for ` left ' ) is unity at early times , and falls as a power law near @xmath374 , being equal to @xmath379 at @xmath374 : @xmath380 where @xmath381 is an ad - hoc parameter that controls the smoothness of the transition .",
    "similarly , if a spectrum is valid in the range @xmath382 ( such as spectrum 2 in the example above ) , the weighting function ( @xmath383 for right ) rises as a power law at early times , is equal to @xmath379 at @xmath374 , and asymptotes to unity as @xmath384 : @xmath385    finally , for a spectrum that is bracketed by two transition times , @xmath386 $ ] ( such as spectrum 1 above ; note that this can be true of more that one spectrum ) , we define a weighting function , @xmath387 ( for ` mid ' ) : @xmath388    the compound spectrum at any instant , @xmath389 is then computed by adding together weighted contributions from all spectra allowed under the given set of physical parameters . for instance , in the above example , @xmath390    since these weighting functions are designed to evaluate to unity far away from a spectral transition and fall as a power law near transitions , the above expression evaluates to the correct spectral shapes in all asymptotic limits .",
    "the weighting functions for two adjoining spectra at the transition time are both equal to one half , so both neighboring spectra contribute equally at a spectral transition ; this results in smooth light curves at all frequencies even across spectral transitions .",
    "finally , we note that the index @xmath381 is an arbitrary choice ; we find that @xmath391 ( corresponding to weighting by hyperbolic tangent functions in log - space ) works well and yields smooth light curves near transitions , without significantly disturbing the spectrum away from transitions .",
    "radio emission from a grb afterglow traversing the milky way is susceptible to scintillation  scattering by inhomogeneities in the electron density distribution of the interstellar medium ( ism ) along the line of sight .",
    "the phenomenon is often modeled as being produced at a scattering screen located between the source and the observer .",
    "the screen produces a speckle pattern on the detection plane , resulting in a modulation of the flux as the observer moves through the speckles .",
    "the effect of scintillation decreases above a transition frequency , characteristic of the general direction of the line of sight through the galaxy ( typically around 10  ghz ) .",
    "the spectrum of the electron density inhomogeneities in the ism is well - characterized by the kolmogorov spectrum @xcite , @xmath392 where @xmath393 is the wave - vector and @xmath394 is a normalization constant that varies from place to place with the galaxy .",
    "the scattering measure is defined as the integral of @xmath394 from the observer to the scattering screen , @xmath395 @xcite used pulsar observations to build a model of the electron density distribution in the galaxy .",
    "we use their model , ne2001 , to determine the scattering measure and transition frequency along the line of sight to the grb .",
    "we then compute the distance to the scattering screen using the formula @xcite , @xmath396 the strength of the scattering can be quantified by a parameter , @xmath397 , defined as @xmath398 where @xmath399 is the observing frequency , with @xmath400 and @xmath401 corresponding to the weak and strong scattering regimes , respectively @xcite .",
    "having calculated @xmath397 , we follow the prescription of @xcite to compute the modulation index , @xmath402 , computing the source size from the formula in appendix a of @xcite . the expected scatter in the observed flux density due to scintillation",
    "is then given by @xmath403 where @xmath404 is the predicted flux density from the afterglow synchrotron model .",
    "we add this uncertainty in quadrature to the flux density uncertainty in each data point prior to performing likelihood analyses .",
    "grb  120521c exhibits excess radio emission at 21.8ghz at 1.15d compared to the best - fit forward shock ( fs ) model ( figure [ fig:120521c_multimodel_ism ] ) . in section [ text : results ] we suggested that this may be due to contribution from a reverse shock ( rs ) . here we discuss a self - consistent rs + fs model that accounts for this excess emission .",
    "we do not search all possible rs models exhaustively , since the excess emission is observed in only a single data point , but list a plausible model that accounts for the observations .",
    "we begin with a general discussion of the radio light curve of reverse shocks in an ism environment . in the standard afterglow model ,",
    "the reverse shock produces a synchrotron spectrum with a characteristic synchrotron frequency ( @xmath405 ) , cooling frequency ( @xmath406 ) , self - absorption frequency ( @xmath407 ) , and overall flux normalization ( @xmath408 ) . at the time",
    "the reverse shock traverses the ejecta , the deceleration time ( @xmath409 ) , these parameters are linked to those of the forward shock by the relations , @xmath410 , @xmath411 , and @xmath412 , where @xmath413 is the initial lorentz factor of the ejecta .",
    "we use the simplest model to explain the data for grb  120521c and assume that the ejecta are in the slow cooling regime ( @xmath414 ) after @xmath409 , although it is possible that the opposite is true in the initial afterglow phase . at low frequencies and early times the reverse shock emission",
    "is expected to be self - absorbed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the light curve therefore depends upon the relative ordering of @xmath405 , @xmath407 , and the observing frequency .",
    "we note that the 21.8ghz radio detection for grb  120521c at @xmath415d , with an excess flux density of @xmath416jy compared to the fs model , is preceded by a deeper non - detection at the same frequency at 0.15d . subtracting the fs contribution to the 21.8ghz flux density at 0.15d",
    ", we find an upper limit to the rs contribution at 0.15d of @xmath417jy .",
    "the light curve at 21.8ghz is thus clearly rising between 0.15 and 1.15d and falling thereafter , implying that it reached a peak some time between 0.15 and 1.15d and indicating that the putative rs component is self - absorbed at this frequency at 0.15d .",
    "regardless of the ordering of @xmath407  and @xmath405 , a peak in the 21.8ghz light curve must correspond to the passage of @xmath407through this frequency , since this is the only way to explain a late - time ( @xmath418 ) turn - over in a rs light curve .",
    "if we assume that @xmath405  @xmath419  @xmath407 , then @xmath405  must pass through 21.8ghz even later than the apparent peak of the 21.8ghz light curve at @xmath420d .",
    "our ism model indicates @xmath421  @xmath422hz at 1d , implying @xmath423 , which is too low .",
    "we therefore look for a self - consistent rs solution with @xmath405  @xmath172  @xmath407  at 0.15d . in this scenario , the light curve rises as @xmath424 prior to the passage of @xmath407 , and then declines as @xmath425 ( using @xmath426 , the median value estimated for the fs ) . from the upper limit at @xmath427d",
    "we can determine the earliest time at which @xmath407  can pass through @xmath202ghz .",

    "this method does not allow us to precisely locate @xmath405 , with the only constraint that it passes through 21.8ghz at @xmath432d .",

    "assuming that the deceleration time is of the order of @xmath438 , we arrive at an initial lorentz factor of @xmath439 for this grb , of the correct order of magnitude for grbs @xcite .",
