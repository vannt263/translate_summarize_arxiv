    "light - front tamm - dancoff method is a promising nonperturbative hamiltonian approach to quantum field theories  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the fock decomposition of the state vector , which schematically reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the total four - momentum of the physical system considered , @xmath2 represents a state with the fixed number @xmath3 of particles ( the @xmath3-body fock sector , @xmath4 ) , and the coefficients @xmath5 are relativistic wave functions ( or fock components ) .",
    "the interaction between constituents , generally speaking , does not conserve the number and type of particles , so that the state vector is a mixture of an infinite number of fock sectors .",
    "light - front dynamics ( lfd ) proposed by dirac  @xcite represents an effective formalism to calculate state vectors in fock space .",
    "lfd defines the state vector on a null plane , also known as a light front . in covariant notations ,",
    "this plane is given by the equation @xmath6{$\\cdot$}}x=0 $ ] , where @xmath7 is a null four - vector , @xmath8 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "it is traditional to choose the light front to be @xmath9 , corresponding to @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the state vector of a physical particle can be obtained by diagonalizing the light - front hamilton operator which is the minus - component of the four - momentum operator : @xmath11 the symbol `` hat '' hereafter indicates that the corresponding quantity is an operator .",
    "the standard lfd minus- , plus- , and transverse components of the four - momentum are , respectively , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the mass of the physical system considered .",
    "the eigenvector @xmath16 can be used to calculate observables , such , e.g. , as the electromagnetic form factors .",
    "the light - front tamm - dancoff method does not rely on the expansion in powers of coupling constants and thus is nonperturbative in nature .",
    "wave functions obtained in this process provide direct information on the structure of the system  @xcite .",
    "the light - front hamiltonian approach also enjoys some other advantages that makes it particularly appealing as an alternative method to nonperturbative lagrangian approaches such as lattice gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "in practical calculations however one can not retain the whole ( infinite ) set of the fock sectors and one has to truncate the fock decomposition of the state vector by omitting fock sectors which contain more than a finite number @xmath17 of constituents .",
    "we will refer to such an approximation as the fock space truncation of order @xmath17 , or , equivalently , the @xmath17-body truncation .",
    "in truncated fock space , the hamiltonian eigenvalue equation  ( [ eqn : hamiltonian_eigenvalue_equation ] ) reduces to a finite system of coupled linear integral equations for the wave functions @xmath18 .",
    "it is convenient to represent this equation in a diagrammatic form by using the lfd graph techniques  @xcite .",
    "fock space truncation means that one should neglect all diagrams containing more than @xmath17 particles in intermediate states .",
    "quantum field theory suffers from divergences , with no exception for lfd . as a consequence , they appear in the eigenvalue problem eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hamiltonian_eigenvalue_equation ] ) as well .",
    "regularization and renormalization have to be carried out wherein the bare coupling and bare masses , or the corresponding counterterms , are fixed via the physical coupling and physical masses .",
    "the divergences are then absorbed into the counterterms which are not observable . in nonperturbative approaches such as the light - front tamm - dancoff method ,",
    "the renormalization , of course , is also nonperturbative .",
    "a particular challenge faced in the light - front tamm - dancoff method is how to guarantee the exact cancellation of the divergences . in perturbation theory ,",
    "the divergences are canceled order - by - order in the coupling constant @xmath19 .",
    "if some perturbative diagrams of a certain order are absent , the cancellation of divergences of that order may be destroyed .",
    "such a situation takes place , when calculating the state vector in truncated fock space .",
    "indeed , the light - front tamm - dancoff method sums over an infinite number of diagrams with no more than @xmath17 intermediate particles , while all diagrams with @xmath20 and more intermediate particles are omitted .",
    "consider the perturbative expansion of any calculated observable .",
    "since the light - front tamm - dancoff method is nonperturbative , this expansion contains contributions of all orders in @xmath19 but not an exhaustive set in a given order ( say , in the order @xmath3 ) .",
    "the contributions of the order @xmath21 corresponding to @xmath20 and more intermediate particles are absent because of truncation ( do not confuse here the order @xmath3 of perturbative expansion with the fock space truncation of the order @xmath17 ) . starting with some finite order @xmath3 of perturbative expansion , we would see that divergences are not canceled , because a part of the divergent contributions related to the omitted diagrams is missed .",
    "the reason is that diagrams which are of the same order in @xmath19 may correspond to different fock sectors . since higher fock sectors are excluded from consideration , we inevitably omit a part of ( divergent ) contributions needed to cancel those coming from the fock sectors involved . as a consequence ,",
    "the cancellation of divergences may not occur when following the standard renormalization procedure .",
    "fock sector - dependent renormalization ( fsdr ) was proposed  @xcite and systematically developed  @xcite to address this issue . while in perturbation theory the counterterms are determined order - by - order in the coupling constant , in the fsdr scheme the counterterms are determined sector - by - sector in fock space expansion .",
    "that is , we first find the counterterms in the leading , e.g. , two - body , fock space truncation .",
    "they provide renormalization and cancellation of infinities in the leading fock sector . however , they are not sufficient to cancel infinities in the three - body ( next - to - leading ) sector truncation , as it contains both the two- and three - body intermediate states .",
    "the three - body intermediate states require new counterterms  the three - body counterterms , which are found from the renormalization performed within the three - body fock space truncation .",
    "the same procedure is continued in the four - body and higher order truncations .    strict mathematical proof that this procedure eliminates infinities is complicated by the nonperturbative nature of the equations and",
    "does not yet exist .",
    "however , the validity of fsdr is strongly supported by numerical calculations . for instance , in ref .  @xcite the fsdr scheme was applied to the coupling constant and fermion mass renormalization in the yukawa model up to the three - body ( one fermion plus two scalar bosons ) truncation .",
    "numerical calculations of renormalized observables demonstrated their good stability with the increase of the regularization parameters  the pauli - villars ( pv ) masses . in refs .",
    "@xcite , very good stability of calculated observables was found in the scalar yukawa model up to the four - body truncation ( one heavy scalar boson plus three light scalar bosons ) .",
    "these highly nontrivial numerical calculations provide good arguments in favor of fsdr as an effective method of nonperturbative renormalization and show a prospect for a broader range of its applications .",
    "recent studies of the scalar yukawa model  @xcite also give one more dimension of support for the light - front tamm - dancoff method equipped with the fsdr scheme .",
    "comparison of the electromagnetic form factors obtained successively within two- , three- , and four - body truncations shows their rather fast convergence with respect to the order of truncation .",
    "this result indicates that , at least in the given model , the four - body truncation almost saturates the state vector and the calculated value of the electromagnetic form factor is already close to the exact one .",
    "originally , the fsdr scheme was formulated on the basis of the `` true '' yukawa model with a spin-1/2 fermion  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , renormalization of a theory of particles with spin in lfd encounters many technical difficulties having no direct relation to fsdr ( more complicated spin structure of wave functions , appearance of additional counterterms depending on the light front orientation , sensitivity of results to the choice of regularization , etc . )",
    "the complexity of attendant mathematical derivations conceals , to some extent , the basic ideas of fsdr , which are rather general and applicable to a variety of realistic quantum field theories .",
    "for this reason , in the present paper we give a detailed exposition how to apply fsdr scheme in practice , using the scalar yukawa model in truncated fock space .",
    "this allows us to illustrate the fsdr method in a simple but nontrivial example .",
    "we will present in detail the solution of the scalar yukawa model in the two- and three - body truncations .",
    "another purpose of the paper concerns the following . according to the fsdr scheme , in recent studies of the scalar yukawa model  @xcite in the four - body truncation",
    ", the values of the bare coupling constant and the heavy boson mass counterterm from the three - body truncation were used .",
    "however , the details of their derivation were omitted .",
    "this paper serves to fill the gap .",
    "the bare coupling constant and the mass counterterm obtained below can also be used in the future for solving a relativistic bound state problem up to four - body truncation ( two heavy plus two light scalar bosons ) .",
    "note that the renormalized scalar yukawa model in the three - body truncation was also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , but without reference to fsdr .",
    "though such an approach led to acceptable results for the particular model and the particular order of truncation , it does not seem universal from the point of view of divergence cancellation , in contrast to fsdr .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in sec .",
    "[ sect2a ] with a brief description of the scalar yukawa model . in sec .",
    "[ sect2 ] a general equation for the state vector in lfd is formulated . in sec .",
    "[ sect3 ] we expose the main features of fsdr .",
    "solutions for the state vector in the scalar yukawa model are found in the two- and three - body truncations in secs .",
    "[ sec5 ] and  [ sec6 ] , respectively . in sec .",
    "[ ff ] we calculate an observable quantity  the scalar heavy boson electromagnetic form factor  in the two- and three - body truncations , successively . in sec .",
    "[ g03x ] we discuss the properties of the bare coupling constant determined by the renormalization .",
    "[ concl ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "we consider an electrically charged heavy scalar boson ( @xmath22 ) with the physical mass @xmath23 , dressed by lighter neutral scalar bosons ( @xmath24 ) with the physical mass @xmath25 . to mimic somehow real nucleon - pion physics , we tentatively assign them , respectively , the nucleon and pion masses matters , and we will suppress all units . ] , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and will call them scalar nucleon and scalar pion , omitting sometimes the word `` scalar '' , for shortness .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian reads @xmath28 where the bare coupling constant @xmath29 and the nucleon mass counterterm @xmath30 are renormalization constants to be determined by the renormalization procedure .",
    "we denote the physical coupling constant as @xmath19 which is found from typical scattering experiments , e.g. , by the analytic continuation of the measured two scalar nucleon elastic scattering amplitude , as a function of the momentum transfer square , to the scalar pion pole in the nonphysical kinematical region ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : scattering ] ) .    .",
    "in the vicinity of this pole the amplitude has the form @xmath31.,scaledwidth=15.0% ]    for convenience , we introduce a dimensionless coupling constant @xmath32 which appears as the coupling constant of the nonrelativistic yukawa potential @xmath33 between two scalar nucleons .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction is not explicitly included into the lagrangian  ( [ lagr ] ) because it is assumed much weaker than the interaction between scalar nucleons and pions .",
    "we will need it only for the calculation of the nucleon electromagnetic form factor , where it will be taken into account perturbatively .",
    "in contrast to the electromagnetic fine structure constant @xmath34 , the coupling constant @xmath35 is not implied to be small and no expansions in it are used .    to regularize the theory , we introduce a pv scalar pion field @xmath36 with a large mass @xmath37 .",
    "the pv pion field is enough to regularize rather weak ( logarithmic ) divergences which appear in the scalar yukawa model , i.e. , there is no need to introduce an analogous pv nucleon field .",
    "since pv fields have negative metric , the lagrangian becomes @xmath38 + \\sum_{j=0}^1 g_0\\chi^\\dagger \\chi \\varphi_j , \\label{lagrpv}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath39 denotes a type of particle : the values @xmath40 and @xmath41 correspond , respectively , to the physical and pv scalar pion fields , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "similar procedure was used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our main goal is to calculate the state vector @xmath16 of the scalar nucleon .",
    "then it can be used for calculating observables . the fock space generated by",
    "the lagrangian  ( [ lagr ] ) embraces all fock sectors composed of scalar nucleons , antinucleons , and pions .",
    "each fock sector contains one nucleon plus an arbitrary number of nucleon - antinucleon pairs plus arbitrary number of pions .",
    "it is known however that the contribution from the nucleon - antinucleon loops causes the instability of the vacuum  @xcite .",
    "we therefore truncate away all fock sectors with antinucleons and construct a truncated fock space from a set of fock sectors with one scalar nucleon and increasing number of scalar pions .",
    "this procedure , however , comes with a penalty , as we will discuss below .",
    "the introduction of pv scalar pions into the lagrangian  ( [ lagrpv ] ) extends the fock space , which impacts the rule of particle counting inside fock sectors .",
    "we postulate that pv scalar pions come to the theory on equal grounds with the physical ones .",
    "this means that any pion is counted as one particle , regardless to its type .",
    "the explicitly covariant form of lfd , as a more general approach mentioned in the introduction , has many technical advantages in comparison with its noncovariant forms @xcite . in particular",
    ", the four - vector @xmath7 serves as an indicator of possible dependence of calculated results on the light front orientation .",
    "this is especially important in approximate nonperturbative calculations , where such dependence may appear in calculated observables due to rotational symmetry breaking . for particles with spin",
    ", covariant lfd facilitates studying the spin structure of scattering amplitudes . in spite of these merits , for the case of scalar particles ,",
    "these different forms of lfd are almost equivalent , even from the technical point of view .",
    "for this reason , we will not distinguish them below and , retaining in some instances the four - vector @xmath7 in explicit form , we will assume that it has definite components @xmath44 .",
    "if so , we have @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath6{$\\cdot$}}a = a^+$ ] for an arbitrary four - vector @xmath48 .    in lfd",

    "we need the hamiltonian in the interaction representation , i.e. , that expressed through the free fields . for particles with spin or",
    "if the interaction depends on field derivatives the procedure may be , generally speaking , very nontrivial .",
    "the reason is that in lfd some of the equations of motion for field components are not dynamical equations but constraints .",
    "exclusion of the non - dynamical degrees of freedom give rise to specific ( contact ) terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "this point is explained in more detail in ref .",
    "fortunately , all that does not concern the case of scalar yukawa model we consider here , because each scalar field has only one component .",
    "if so , one can simply identify the hamiltonian with the interaction part of the lagrangian taken with the opposite sign : @xmath62 to avoid overload with notations , we do not show explicitly the contribution of pv particles .",

    "first , such a factorization in lfd takes place on the energy shell only , while in the feynman case it holds for the off - mass - shell vertex as well .",
