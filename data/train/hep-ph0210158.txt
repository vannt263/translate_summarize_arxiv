    "the quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) is one of the most interesting targets in the finite - temperature quark - hadron physics @xcite .",
    "currently , the qgp creation experiment is being performed in rhic project at bnl , and much progress in understanding the finite - temperature qcd is desired .",
    "historically , the instability of the hadron phase was first argued by hagedorn @xcite before the discovery of qcd .",
    "he pointed out the possibility of a phase transition at finite temperature , based on the string or the flux - tube picture of hadrons@xcite .",
    "after qcd was established as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction , this transition was recognized as the deconfinement phase transition to the qgp phase , where quarks and gluons are liberated with the restored chiral symmetry .",
    "the qcd phase transition has been studied using various infrared effective models of qcd such as the linear @xmath2 model@xcite , the nambu - jona - lasinio model@xcite , the dual ginzburg - landau theory@xcite and so on .    in order to study nonperturbative features of the qcd phase transition",
    ", the lattice qcd monte carlo calculation serves as a powerful tool directly based on qcd .",
    "it has been already extensively used to study the nature of the qcd phase transition . at the quenched level , su(3 )",
    "lattice qcd indicates the existence of the deconfinement phase transition of a weak first order at @xmath3 mev @xcite . on the other hand , in the presence of dynamical quarks",
    ", it indicates the chiral phase transition at @xmath4 mev for @xmath5 and @xmath6 mev for @xmath7 in the chiral limit @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we attempt to understand the physical implications of the recent lattice qcd results on the qcd phase transition , and point out an abnormal nature of the quenched qcd phase transition based on the statistical argument . in the actual calculation",
    ", we adopt the statistical approach to the qcd phase transition with the bag - model picture of hadrons @xcite .",
    "although it is a simply - minded phenomenological effective model , it can reproduce the critical temperature of the full - qcd phase transition `` amazingly '' well . in spite of this success ,",
    "this approach terribly overestimates the critical temperature in quenched qcd .",
    "we consider the essential cause of this overestimate , and point out a serious problem hidden in the qcd phase transition in a model - independent manner .",
    "the contents are organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec.full.qcd ] , we give a brief review of the statistical approach to the qcd phase transition with the bag - model picture of hadrons , and derive a phenomenological relation among the hadron masses , the hadron sizes and the critical temperature .",
    "we apply this relation to full qcd . in sect .",
    "[ sec.quench.qcd ] , we apply this relation to quenched qcd without dynamical quarks , and point out a serious problem on the critical temperature . in sect .",
    "[ sec.discussion ] , after the summary of the results , we attempt to clarify the essence of this problem , and discuss an abnormal nature of the deconfinement phase transition in quenched qcd .",
    "we investigate analytically the features of the qcd phase transition based on the statistical treatment with the bag - model picture of hadrons .",
    "we begin by deriving a phenomenological relation between the critical temperature @xmath8 and the properties of the hadrons , i.e. , the mass and the size . in the bag - model picture ,",
    "quarks and gluons are assumed to be confined inside a spherical bag . here , color confinement is simply taken into account through the bag - like intrinsic structure of hadrons . at low temperature ,",
    "only a small number of such bags are thermally excited , and the thermodynamic properties of the system are described in terms of these spatially isolated bags . with the increasing temperature , the number of the thermally excited bags increases .",
    "gradually , these bags begin to overlap one another , and they finally cover the whole space region at a critical temperature @xmath8 in this picture . above @xmath8 , since the volume of the outside disappears , the whole space is filled with liberated quarks and gluons , and the thermodynamic properties of the system is now governed by quarks and gluons . in this way , the qcd phase transition is described in terms of the overlaps of the thermally excited bags .",
    "such a physical interpretation of the qcd phase transition is called as the closed packing picture .",
    "to proceed , we define the spatial occupation ratio @xmath9 at temperature @xmath10 to be the ratio of the total volume of the spatial regions inside the thermally excited bags to the volume @xmath11 of the whole space region . in the closed packing picture of the qcd phase transition",
    ", @xmath9 plays the key role , which is estimated as @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the number at temperature @xmath10 , the degeneracy , the mass and the bag radius of the @xmath17-th elementary excitation , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath18 is defined by @xmath19 and its functional form is plotted against @xmath20 in fig .",
    "[ f - m - t ] . note that @xmath21 is a characteristic function to describe the thermal contribution of the boson with the mass @xmath22 at the temperature @xmath10 @xcite . for @xmath23",
    ", @xmath21 decreases exponentially with @xmath24 , and the thermal contribution is expected to become negligible .     in eq .",
    "( [ fmt ] ) plotted against @xmath25 . ]",
    "as mentioned before , in the closed packing picture , the phase transition takes place , when the thermally excited bags almost cover the whole space region .",
    "hence , the critical temperature @xmath8 is estimated by solving @xmath26    now , we investigate the phase transition in full qcd using the statistical approach . in full qcd , the lightest physical excitation is the pion , and all the other hadrons are rather heavy as @xmath27 , @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , the pion is considered to play the key role in describing the thermodynamic properties of full qcd below @xmath8 from the viewpoint of the statistical physics .",
    "hence , in most cases , only the pionic degrees of freedom are taken into account in the hadron phase in the argument of the full - qcd phase transition . by using the isospin degeneracy @xmath28 , the mass @xmath29 mev and the radius @xmath30 fm , we solve eq .",

    "considering its closeness to the full lattice qcd result with @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath33 mev , the statistical approach to the full - qcd phase transition seems to be rather good .",
    "we now consider the @xmath34-dependence of the critical temperature @xmath8 .",
    "note that , in the actual lattice qcd calculations , the pion mass is taken to be still rather heavy as @xmath35 mev for the technical reasons . from these data , the critical temperature @xmath8 in the chiral limit",
    "is obtained using the chiral extrapolation .",

    "the phase transition becomes just a cross - over for intermediate values of @xmath34 .",
    "hence , in ref.@xcite , the pseudo critical temperature is adopted as @xmath8 , which is determined from the peak positions of the susceptibilities of the polyakov loop and so on .    for the @xmath5 case , we plot , in fig .",

    "in spite of the absence of the dynamical quarks , quenched qcd provides various important nonperturbative features such as the color confinement and instantons .",
    "hence , to understand some of the nonperturbative natures of qcd , quenched qcd plays the primary role , serving as a simplified version of the complicated real problems . in this section ,",
    "we apply the statistical approach with the bag - model picture to quenched qcd in a similar manner done in the previous section .    due to the color confinement",
    ", only the color - singlet modes can appear as physical excitations , and such modes are called as glueballs in quenched qcd .",
    "the mass spectrum of the glueballs is known through the quenched lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "the lightest physical excitation is the @xmath61 glueball with @xmath62 gev . following the similar argument as in the full qcd case",
    ", the lowest @xmath61 glueball is expected to play the key role in describing the thermodynamic properties of quenched qcd in the confinement phase .",
    "hence , we first take into account only the @xmath61 glueball .",
    "as for the size @xmath63 of the scalar glueball , we note that there is no widely agreed value on it .",
    "we adopt a rather small value as @xmath64 0.4fm , which has been indicated by recent lattice qcd studies @xcite .",
    "we use the degeneracy @xmath65 , the mass @xmath66 mev @xcite , and @xmath67 fm as inputs .",

    "this large discrepancy would be a serious problem in the quenched qcd phase transition .    to seek a possible solution",
    ", we examine the case with a larger value of the glueball size @xmath63 , since there is no established value on @xmath63 .     plotted against the lowest @xmath61 glueball mass @xmath74 in the statistical approach assuming various glueball sizes as @xmath75 fm . the cross ( @xmath76 )",

    "however , such a drastic thermal swelling of the lowest scalar glueball was rejected by the recent lattice qcd studies @xcite , which states that the thermal glueball size is almost unchanged even near @xmath8 . in any case",
    ", the glueball size does not seem to provide the solution on this discrepancy .",
    "we may seek for the solution in the drastic pole - mass reduction of the @xmath61 glueball near the critical temperature as was suggested in ref.@xcite in the context of the dual ginzburg - landau theory . in fig .",
    "[ tc - mg ] , we see that , for the problem to be settled , the pole - mass reduction must be as significant as @xmath83 mev .",
    "however , in the recent lattice qcd calculations @xcite , it has been reported that the thermal @xmath61 glueball persists to hold a rather large pole - mass as @xmath84 mev .",
    "hence , we have to seek for another possibility by including the contribution of the excited - state glueballs .",
    "in addition to the lowest @xmath61 glueball with @xmath85 mev and @xmath67 fm , we consider the thermal contribution from the lowest @xmath86 glueball , which is the next lightest hadron in quenched qcd . we take @xmath87 , @xmath88 mev @xcite , @xmath89 fm .",

    "then , the spatial occupation ratio receives a correction as @xmath90 , and the correction amounts to @xmath91 at @xmath73 mev .",
    "the resulting critical temperature is given as @xmath92 mev , which is still too large .",
    "we note that the realistic glueball size would be more compact .",
    "however , if so , its contribution becomes more negligible .    besides these two low - lying glueballs",
    ", the following excited states are predicted in ref.@xcite as @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "we include all the contribution from these excited states , assuming the unknown glueball size as a typical hadron size , i.e. , @xmath106 fm .",
    "the correction by these excited states amounts to only @xmath107 at @xmath108 mev , and the resulting critical temperature is estimated as @xmath109 mev , which is again too large . in this way",
    ", we observe that the statistical approach does not work at all in quenched qcd .",
    "the direct cause of this failure is the extremely small statistical factor @xmath110 , which strongly suppresses the excitations of the glueballs . as a consequence",
    ", only a remarkably tiny fraction of the space region can be covered by the thermally excited bags of glueballs at @xmath73 mev , which can not be the driving force of the qcd phase transition .",
    "we have analytically studied the qcd phase transition based on the statistical treatment with the bag - model picture .",
    "we have derived a phenomenological relation among the critical temperature @xmath8 , the mass and the size of the low - lying hadrons .",
    "first , we have applied this relation to full qcd , and have compared the analytical results with the full lattice qcd results . in full qcd , we have found that this approach works amazingly well . as is expected , the pionic contribution seems to play the main role in determining the critical temperature , and the low - lying vector mesons are found to provide a small but non - negligible contribution .    unlike full qcd",
    ", we have found that the statistical approach terribly overestimates the critical temperature as @xmath69 mev in quenched qcd , and that only a tiny fraction of the space region is covered by the thermally excited bags of glueballs at @xmath111 280mev .",
    "we have considered the possibility of a swelling of the glueball size and reduction of the glueball mass near the critical temperature . however , both of these two have not provided us with the solution on the large discrepancy . in spite of including all the contributions from the 15 low - lying glueballs up to 5 gev predicted in quenched lattice qcd @xcite , the discrepancy remains to be still large .",
    "in other words , the number of the thermally - excited glueballs is still too small at @xmath112 280mev , even after so many glueball excited states are taken into account .",
    "the direct origin of this discrepancy is the strong suppression of the thermal excitation of glueballs due to the extremely small statistical factor as @xmath113 at @xmath73 mev even for the lightest glueball , which leads to the insufficient amount of the covered space by the thermally excited bags of glueballs .",
    "although several arguments given so far have been based on the bag - model picture , this problem itself has a quite general nature , which can go beyond the reliability of the model framework .",
    "we finally reformulate this problem in a model - independent general manner by considering the inter - particle distance @xmath114 instead of the bag size @xmath63 .",
    "note that the reliability of the statistical argument becomes improved in the dilute glueball gas limit .",
    "now , taking into account all the low - lying 15 glueball modes up to 5 gev predicted in quenched lattice qcd @xcite , we calculate the inter - particle distance @xmath114 of the glueballs based on only the statistical argument . at @xmath73 mev",
    ", the inter - particle distance is estimated as @xmath115 fm .",
    "it follows that the deconfinement phase transition takes place at @xmath111 280mev , when the glueball density becomes @xmath116 .",
    "remember that the theoretical estimates of the glueball size are rather small as @xmath117 fm @xcite .",
    "hence , this density seems to be rather dilute .",
    "since the long - range interaction among glueballs is mediated by the virtual one - glueball exchange process in quenched qcd , the interactions among glueballs are exponentially suppressed beyond its compton length @xmath118 fm .",
    "therefore , one can not expect the strong long - range interaction acting among the spatially - separated thermal glueballs .    in this way , it is quite difficult to imagine how such a too rare excitation of thermal glueballs can lead to the phase transition .",
    "we are thus arrive at the mystery .",
    "what is really the trigger or the driving force of the deconfinement phase transition in quenched qcd ? in order to understand the qcd phase transition , this problem should be seriously considered .",
