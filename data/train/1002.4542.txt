    "scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) has proven to be an invaluable tool for studying single molecules and their potential applications in nanoscale devices .",
    "in addition to measuring conductance properties , the electroluminescence spectrum , induced by the tunneling current can be studied.@xcite electroluminescence has been experimentally observed on clean metal surfaces,@xcite",
    "films,@xcite nanoparticles,@xcite and single molecules.@xcite additionally , electroluminescence has been observed in lithographically defined three - terminal cdse single - nanocrystal junctions.@xcite in the case of single molecules , the simultaneous measurement of the electrical and optical behavior has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of nanoscale junctions , and , through detailed analysis of the vibrational spectrum , to provide valuable insight into the conformational structure of single molecules in a junction.@xcite    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the measured and calculated quantum yield as a function of the bias voltage are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h2tbpp_qc ] .",
    "the difference in absolute magnitude between the measurement and the calculation is due to the unknown detection efficiency in the measurement , which is taken to be a 100  % in the calculation . in both the measurement and the calculation ,",
    "the quantum yield is zero until an excited state becomes available in the bias voltage window.@xcite it then increases until a maximum is reached when all vibrationally excited states have become available .",
    "as noted above , the quantum yield depends on @xmath0 , and not on @xmath1 .",
    "since going from positive to negative bias effectively means switching @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the maximum value of the quantum yield changes by a factor of @xmath2 , and is therefore directly proportional to the asymmetry in the electronic coupling .    in the measurement ,",
    "the quantum yield drops when the bias exceeds 3.5  v , which is attributed to damage to the molecules in ref .  .",
    "this can , however , also be explained by the appearance of another charge state in the bias window , which changes the quantum yield by a factor of @xmath3 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] ) . with approximately equal couplings to the source and drain ( @xmath4 ) ,",
    "the quantum yield is reduced by about 50% [ as is the case in fig .",
    "[ fig : h2tbpp_qc](b ) ] .",
    "however , with very asymmetric , couplings ( @xmath5 ) , as is the case in the measurement of qiu _",
    "et al._,@xcite the reduction is expected to be unobservable .     calculated current dependence of h@xmath6tbpp at positive and negative bias .",
    "the current is varied by changing the electronic coupling to the stm tip . ]",
    "dong _ _ et al.__@xcite do not report on the current dependence of the photon count.@xcite however , in the case of symmetric coupling , a linear dependence of the photon count on the current , by varying @xmath1 with the stm tip , is still expected at positive bias ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : h2tbpp_current ] ) . at negative bias , on the other hand",
    ", varying the position of the stm tip equals changing @xmath0 , resulting in a _ decrease _ in the photon count with increasing current , albeit at a lower rate .",
    "this is a direct result of the dependence of the quantum yield on @xmath0 via @xmath7 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] ) .",
    "high - energy part of the calculated electroluminescence spectrum of h@xmath6tbpp at 2.5  v as a function of the vibrational relaxation time .",
    "@xmath8  k for clarity , the other parameters are the same as in fig .  [",
    "fig : h2tbpp_spectrum](b ) .",
    "note the appearance of peaks at around 600  nm , to the left of the main peak , when the vibrational relaxation time becomes comparable to the electron transmission rate . ]",
    "since vibrational relaxation is several orders of magnitude faster than photo - emission ( which is on the order of 10@xmath9  s in the measurements and calculations under discussion ) , it is assumed in standard fluorescence measurements that the molecule is always in the vibrational ground state before emitting a photon , although at finite temperatures the lowest vibrational excitations can still be occupied , _",
    "e.g. _ , as observed in anti - stokes scattering . in transport measurements",
    ", however , even the higher vibrationally excited states are continuously repopulated by new electrons from the leads .",
    "when the electron transmission rate becomes on the order of the photo - emission rate , vibrational relaxation will not always take place before the electron leaves the excited state .",
    "it is therefore the ratio between the vibrational relaxation rate and the electron transmission rate , not just the photo - emission rate , that determines the emission spectrum .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : h2tbpp_relaxation ] , where we have plotted the high energy part of the emission spectrum of h@xmath6tbpp for different values of the vibrational relaxation time .",
    "peaks start appearing to the _ left _ of the main peak , _",
    "i.e. _ , at higher energies , as soon as the vibrational relaxation rate becomes comparable to the electron transmission rate ( at around 10@xmath10  s ) .",
    "this effect may be present in the electroluminescence spectrum measured by dong _ _ et al.__@xcite",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig : h2tbpp_spectrum](a ) ] , where such a peak can be seen at around 40  nm to the left of the main peak .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that a computationally efficient method  all calculations have been performed on commodity hardware  based on the rate - equation formalism is able to obtain good agreement with the measured electroluminescence spectra of two different porphyrin derivatives .",
    "we reproduce the bias voltage and current dependence of the spectra for both symmetric and asymmetric couplings and provide an explanation for the suppression of the quantum yield at high bias .",
    "although in the measurement of dong _ _ et al.__@xcite this suppression may have been caused by damage to molecules,@xcite a significant reduction in the quantum yield is expected in general for every ( nearly ) symmetrically coupled single - molecule junction in the sequential tunneling regime .",
    "in addition , we have shown that vibrational relaxation rates become important when they are comparable to the electron transmission rate , giving rise to peaks in the spectra at higher energies higher than the homo - lumo gap . however",
    ", a detailed study of this effect requires a more sophisticated model for vibrational relaxation , since a single relaxation time for all vibrational modes is only a sufficiently accurate approximation when relaxation is either much faster or much slower than all other rates .",
    "we thank ferry prins for discussions and chris verzijl for help with the calculations .",
