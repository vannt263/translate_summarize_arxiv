    "in physics , properties of a large system ( e.g. , the universe ) are typically inferred based on observations restricted to a small part of it ( namely the part which is accessible to our experiments ) . for example , based on experiments in a laboratory showing that a hydrogen atom absorbs radiation at a certain wavelength , we naturally conjecture that the same is true for all hydrogen atoms in the universe . in other words",
    ", we expect that a limited number of local experiments is sufficient to derive general physical laws .    ]    while this paradigm is crucial for the interpretation of experimental data , it is , however , generally impossible to provide experimental evidence in support of the paradigm itself .",
    "so , how else can it be justified ?",
    "what exactly are the underlying assumptions ? to answer these questions , we consider an abstract problem , in the following referred to as the _ tomography problem _ ( cf .   fig .",
    "[ fig : prob ] ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be @xmath1 subsystems of a large composite system and assume that individual experiments are performed on @xmath2 of the subsystems , @xmath3 , for @xmath4 .",
    "the goal is to infer the physical state of the remaining @xmath5 subsystems @xmath6 , based on this experimental data .",
    "note that the characteristics of the observed subsystems @xmath3 might , in general , be completely unrelated to the characteristics of @xmath6 , in which case the observation of the former does not give any information on the latter .",
    "hence , in order to achieve the above goal , one needs to make certain minimal assumptions on the structural properties of the overall system .    in this article , we demonstrate that , for non - relativistic quantum systems , the tomography problem can be solved under the sole assumption that the overall system is symmetric under permutations of the @xmath1 subsystems .",
    "more generally , we show that any symmetric system can be analysed in the same way as if its subsystems were independent and identical copies of each other|symmetry is thus sufficient to justify the paradigm of experimental physics described at the beginning .",
    "remarkably , symmetry of realistic systems often holds in general because of certain natural properties such as the indistinguishability of identical particles .",
    "the result thus has a wide range of applications .",
    "these include quantum information theory and cryptography , where it enables the generalisation of statements which previously have only been known to be true under certain independence assumptions .",
    "the physical state @xmath7 of an @xmath1-partite system is said to be _ independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "_ if its @xmath1 parts are identical copies of some _ prototype state _ @xmath8 , i.e. , formally , @xmath9.we adopt the density operator formalism which is commonly used in quantum mechanics .",
    "note that the formalism also applies to purely classical systems . in this case , all density operators are diagonal with respect to the same basis and can be interpreted as probability distributions . ]",
    "note that , by applying only individual measurements on a certain ( sufficiently large ) number of subsystems , the corresponding prototype @xmath8 can be estimated to any desired accuracy .",
    "the tomography problem described above ( cf .",
    "[ fig : prob ] ) can thus be solved under the assumption that the state of the system is i.i.d .",
    "this assumption , however , is mostly impossible to justify for realistic systems . in particular , there is no experiment on @xmath10 subsystems providing enough data to exclude the possibility that there exist correlations involving @xmath11 subsystems ( see also example  [ ex : loc ] below ) .    the state @xmath7 of an @xmath1-partite system is called _ symmetric _ if it is invariant under swappings of its subsystems , i.e. , formally @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is an arbitrary permutation ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : symm ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to say that the order in which the subsystems are represented mathematically is independent of their physical properties .",
    "note that any i.i.d .",
    "state is symmetric , whereas the opposite implication does generally not hold .",
    "moreover , for realistic systems , symmetry often follows from certain natural properties such as the indistinguishability of its subsystems .",
    "finally , in practical applications , symmetry can sometimes be _ enforced _ by randomly permuting the subsystems ( as illustrated below ) .    ]",
    "as discussed above , the i.i.d .",
    "property is strong enough to enable applications such as tomography .",
    "however , for real physical systems , it is often only possible to justify symmetry .",
    "this raises the question whether symmetry of a physical state still implies a certain similarity to i.i.d",
    ".  states .",

    "in particular , it has been shown that the statement above holds for any quantum system with finite - dimensional subsystems  @xcite as well as for certain systems with infinite - dimensional subsystems  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some of these results have been transformed via choi - jamiokowski isomorphism into statements about completely positive maps ( cpms ) , which are used to characterise a system s dynamics  @xcite .",

    "the representation theorem outlined in the previous section now implies that the same is still true approximately under the sole assumption that the system s state is symmetric .",
    "a similar reasoning applies to problems in information theory and , in particular , cryptography .",
    "a main challenge in these disciplines is to characterise the resources ( such as entanglement ) which are needed to perform certain tasks ( e.g. , teleportation ) . for this , it is often convenient ( and very common ) to consider resources which consist of many identical and independent parts or , more precisely , to assume that the states describing the resources satisfy the i.i.d .",
    "it is an immediate consequence of our representation theorem that this assumption can be relaxed to a symmetry assumption .",
    "this relaxation is crucial because , in many information - theoretic scenarios , it suffices to consider symmetric states in order to cover the most general case .",
    "in fact , symmetry of the states can often be enforced by applying randomly chosen permutations , as illustrated by the following example ( see also the appendix  [ app : ex ] for an additional example ) .",
    "as indicated above , the global representation theorem has various applications . as an example",
    ", we derive a generic result in quantum cryptography  @xcite .",
    "the result implies security of a large class of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) schemes against any attack allowed by the laws of quantum physics . generally speaking , qkd is the art of distributing a ( random ) secret key to two distant parties , using only communication over an insecure quantum channel as well as an authentic ( but public ) classical channel .",
    "typical qkd schemes consist of two subsequent phases  @xcite : in a _ distribution phase _ , one of the parties , traditionally called _",

    "[ fig : qkd ] ) .",

    ", alice and bob apply local measurements to their particles , resulting in a pair of correlated classical strings , called _ raw keys _ ; finally , depending on an estimate of the strength of correlation between their respective raw keys , alice and bob employ some purely classical procedures to transform them into identical secret keys .    ]    as an adversary might tamper with the particles sent over the ( insecure ) quantum channel , the joint state @xmath76 of the @xmath1 particle pairs held by alice and bob after the distribution phase is generally ( almost ) arbitrary . hence , to prove security of the scheme against general attacks , one has to show that the distillation phase works correctly whatever the state @xmath76 is . because the space of possible states @xmath76 is exponentially large in @xmath1 , this analysis is non - trivial and has only been possible for qkd protocols which satisfy certain specific requirements  @xcite .",
    "in fact , standard information - theoretic arguments are usually restricted to situations where the state @xmath76 is i.i.d .",
    ", i.e. , @xmath77 .",
    "this , however , is only guaranteed for so - called _ collective attacks _ , where the adversary is bound to apply the same operation separately to each of the particles sent over the channel  @xcite .    using the global representation theorem for symmetric states presented in this article",
    ", it can be shown that security of a qkd scheme against collective attacks implies security against arbitrary attacks ( where no restriction is imposed on the adversary ) .",
    "the argument is based on two observations : ( i )  the security of the distillation phase only depends on _ robust _ properties of the state @xmath76 of the @xmath1 particle pairs held by alice and bob after the distribution phase , i.e. , security is not affected by alterations of a small number of subsystems  @xcite .",
    "( ii )  if alice and bob both reorder their particles according to a common randomly chosen permutation then the resulting state of the particle pairs ( averaged over all possible permutations ) is _",
    "symmetric_. now , given a qkd scheme which is provably secure against collective attacks , observation  ( i ) implies that the same scheme is secure whenever the state @xmath76 has some @xmath10-partite part which is @xmath27-i.i.d . , where @xmath78 and @xmath28 .",
    "hence , by our representation theorem , it suffices to verify that @xmath76 is symmetric , which is the case because of observation  ( ii ) .",
    "we thus get the following result : if a qkd scheme is secure against collective attacks then the same scheme , equipped with an additional randomised permutation step inserted after the distribution phase , is secure against any attack allowed by the laws of quantum physics .",
    "we have presented a de finetti style representation theorem which connects two properties that the physical state of a multi - partite system can have : ( i ) _ symmetry : _ swappings of the subsystems leave the state unchanged ; ( ii ) _ i.i.d .",
    ": _ the individual parts of the state are identical and mutually independent .",
    "the theorem states that symmetry of a large system implies that the i.i.d .",
    "property approximately holds on almost the entire system .",
    "the i.i.d .",
    "property is often employed for the study of large systems , but can not usually be verified directly .",
    "in contrast , the symmetry property is , for example , implied by the indistinguishability of the subsystems or can be enforced by a random permutation . as the representation theorem connects these two properties , it has implications within various areas of physics ( as does de finetti s original theorem , which is used , e.g. , in mathematical physics and statistical mechanics  @xcite )",
    ". furthermore , the theorem has consequences for quantum information theory .",
    "for instance , as demonstrated above , it implies that the security of a qkd scheme against general attacks follows directly from its security against collective attacks ( which can be proved using standard information - theoretic arguments ) .    the connection between symmetric and i.i.d .",
    "states is of particular interest for foundational issues  @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , it implies that symmetry suffices to predict physical properties of a large quantum system given only data obtained from the observation of a limited number of subsystems .",
    "since the ability to make predictions is crucial in physics , one might go one step further and postulate that a similar statement should be true within any reasonable physical theory ( other than quantum mechanics ) .",
    "such a postulate would indeed restrict the space of possible theories .",
    "for example , within a theory where physical states are represented as vectors in a real hilbert space , even de finetti s original representation theorem can not hold  @xcite .",
