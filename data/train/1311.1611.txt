    "a useful approach in studies of galaxies is to look for any regularity or universality in the structure and then study astrophysical factors and/or principles responsible for it . regarding galaxy profiles , until now much attention has been paid to possibility of a universal density profile of galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is yet no reliable theoretical or numerical prediction on a universal mass profile of galaxies as existing models are flawed or incomplete and observational results on galactic mass profile are not converging well . on the observational side , there have been suggestions for approximately universal isothermal density profile @xmath17 for both spiral / disk galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) and early - type galaxies ( etgs ; e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , some recent results give a mean profile steeper - than - isothermal in etgs @xcite .",
    "moreover , the density slope @xmath18 may vary with radius in both spirals ( e.g.  @xcite ) and ellipticals ( e.g.  @xcite ) or with redshift @xcite , and the intrinsic galaxy - to - galaxy scatter is significant even within @xmath19 @xmath20 ( e.g.  @xcite ) . on the theoretical side , the classical isothermal model by @xcite has several problems including infinite mass , indefinitely growing entropy @xcite and non - transitive nature @xcite and the applicability and usefulness of equilibrium statistical mechanics to gravitationally - bound collisionless systems are still being investigated ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation in the halo are used to study how the pristine ( i.e.  primitive before galaxy formation ) halo is modified during the course of galaxy formation ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , physics involved in hydrodynamic simulations is so complex that a robust prediction on the mass profile is challenging . therefore , the case for a universal density profile of galaxies as a dynamical attractor or fixed point in dynamical evolution ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) appears weak at present .",
    "as first noticed by @xcite , n - body simulations of hierarchical cold dark matter ( cdm ) halo formation show that the combination @xmath21 of mass density @xmath22 and velocity dispersion ( vd ) @xmath23 of the pristine dm halo , which is called pseudo phase - space ( pps ) density because it has the dimension of the phase - space density ( or distribution function ) but is not a true measure of it ( e.g. , @xcite ) , is closer to universal than @xmath22 and can be well described by a scale - free power - law profile with slope @xmath24/ d\\ln r\\approx 1.9 $ ] over three orders of magnitude in radius ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it appears that @xmath21 rather than @xmath22 offers a more powerful route to the universal nature of pristine halos . in this context",
    ", significant efforts have been made to investigate the physical origin of the universality , scale - free nature and slope value of the @xmath21-profile ( e.g.  @xcite ) and their implication for the structure of pristine dm halos ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we examine mass and vd profiles of galaxies and their combination using sdss elliptical galaxies .",
    "it is argued that there exists a universal profile of pps density - like quantities in elliptical galaxies , akin to the universal pps density profile of pristine dm halos , with an intrinsic scatter smaller than the observed scatter of mass density profiles .",
    "we consider a sample of nearly spherical galaxies that allows a relatively straightforward analysis .",
    "the galaxy sample is drawn from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss : @xcite and references theirin ) and contains @xmath0 nearly spherical ( surface brightness ellipticity @xmath25 ) and disk - less ( disk mass is within the measurement error of the bulge mass ) galaxies at redshifts @xmath26 .",
    "each galaxy is assumed to be in a dynamical equilibrium state satisfying the spherical jeans equation @xcite given by @xmath27}{dr }   + 2 \\frac{\\beta(r)}{r } [ \\rho_{\\star}(r ) \\sigma_{\\rm \\star r}^2(r ) ] = - g \\frac{\\rho_{\\star}(r ) m(r)}{r^2 } , \\label{eq : jeans}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the volume stellar mass distribution , @xmath28 is the total mass within @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the radial stellar vd , and @xmath3 is the vd anisotropy given by @xmath31/   \\left [ 2 \\sigma_{\\rm \\star r}^2(r ) \\right]$ ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are tangential vds of stars in spherical coordinates . the jeans equation can be used to obtain a vd profile @xmath30 for an observationally inferred @xmath1 if @xmath34 and @xmath3 are known or specified .",
    "conversely , if a line - of - sight ( los ) vd profile @xmath35 is measured for some radial range , the jeans equation can be used to derive @xmath34 and @xmath3 along with @xmath30 for the observed radial range . without @xmath35 for sdss galaxies ,",
    "we take the former approach and consider a range of @xmath34 and @xmath3 . for dm distribution",
    "we consider both the case of no dm and assigning a generalized navarro - frenk - white ( gnfw ) halo @xmath36 using a wealth of empirical information , as in @xcite , including statistical distribution of losvd profiles within @xmath37 from well - studied etgs and statistical properties and relations of etgs and dm halos .",
    "we consider both constant anisotropy and radially varying anisotropy using a function of the form @xmath38 , which is a combination of two osipkov - merritt - type @xcite models but allows an extremum at a finite radius .",
    "we take anisotropy values randomly from an observed distribution described in section  2.7 of @xcite . for the case of radially varying anisotropy the mean anisotropy for @xmath39 and the anisotropy at infinity",
    "take a common value drawn from the observed distribution and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are assigned so that an extremum occurs within @xmath19 .",
    "radially varying anisotropies with an extremum ( or extrema ) within @xmath19 result often from dynamical modeling of etgs ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we also consider a small number of etgs of the coma cluster for which @xmath42 has been individually measured up to @xmath43 and thus @xmath34 and @xmath3 along with @xmath30 have been derived from the data @xcite .",
    "specifically , two - component axisymmetric galaxy models are used and a best - fit model is calculated through a maximum entropy implementation of schwarzschild s stellar orbit superposition technique fitting the observed losvd profile .",
    "the detailed modeling results are provided by j. thomas ( private communication ) .",
    "the coma sample consists of 15 etgs selected from 19 etgs @xcite .",
    "our criterion for this selection is that the mean of the radial ranges along the major and minor axes over which losvd profiles were observed extends beyond @xmath44 .",
    "seven of them ( gmp 144 , 282 , 1750 , 3510 , 3792 , 5279 and 5975 ) are ellipticals without significant disks .",
    "the rest are two ellipticals ( gmp 2440 , 3958 ) possessing significant disks and six lenticulars ( gmp 756 , 1176 , 1990 , 2417 , 3414 , and 4928 ) .",
    "the excluded galaxies are gmp 2921 , 3329 , 4822 and 5568 , three of which are cd / d galaxies . because streaming motion can be significant for lenticulars and ellipticals with non - negligible disks , we consider an average 1-dimensional second velocity moment given by @xmath45^{1/2 }   = \\left [ \\sigma_{\\rm \\star}^2(r)+\\frac{1}{3}\\bar{v}_{\\star\\phi}^2(r ) \\right]^{1/2 } , \\label{eq : vrms}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the net intrinsic rotation speed of stars at @xmath29 taking into account the inclination of each coma galaxy ( @xcite ; j. thomas , private communication ) .",
    "notice that @xmath47 if @xmath48 .",
    "if a quantity @xmath50 should follow a universal power - law profile at least for some radial range , then we expect a good correlation between slopes @xmath51 and @xmath52 for some radial range . here",
    "the exponent @xmath53 is unknown but a theoretically interesting value is @xmath54 for which the quantity has the dimension of phase space density . if we write @xmath55 , then we expect @xmath56 for some radial range . to test this hypothesis we calculate values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 and check if there is a correlation . for the sdss sample",
    "we consider a fixed radial range of @xmath59 as this range is most relevant for the modeling results @xcite .",
    "for the coma cluster sample we use the mean of the radial ranges of observed losvd profiles along the major and minor axes , which varies from galaxy to galaxy but is typically @xmath60 . for coma galaxies having net rotations @xmath4",
    "is replaced by @xmath61 ( equation  [ eq : vrms ] ) .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ slopeplane ] displays the correlation between @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "good correlations are found independently from both samples .",
    "the least - square fit relations are @xmath62 ( constant anisotropy ) , @xmath63 ( varying anisotropy ) for the sdss sample and @xmath64 for the coma sample .",
    "similar results are found even for the case of no dm [ i.e.  @xmath65 in which stars are self - gravitating .",
    "these results imply that a pps density - like combination with @xmath54 is expected to be ( close to ) universal with a power - law exponent of @xmath66 , which interestingly matches well the slope @xmath67 predicted by the classical self - similar spherical - infall model @xcite .",
    "the middle and right panels of figure  [ slopeplane ] display the distributions of @xmath68/d\\ln r$ ] against @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the slope @xmath12 is not correlated with either @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "this lack of correlation of @xmath12 is what would be expected if @xmath49 should be universal .",
    "the large number of galaxies in the sdss sample allows us to investigate how slopes are distributed as a function of various parameters .",
    "figure  [ slope_e ] displays the distributions of @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath12 against stellar mass @xmath69 , srsic @xcite index @xmath70 , effective radius @xmath19 , projected stellar mass density @xmath71 within @xmath19 and the host halo virial mass @xmath72 .",
    "only the results with constant anisotropies are displayed here but the case of varying anisotropy is qualitatively similar .",
    "it is evident that @xmath12 is little correlated with any galactic or halo parameter .",
    "in contrast @xmath57 varies systematically in particular with @xmath19 and @xmath73 .",
    "slope @xmath58 also exhibits some systematic trends but to a lesser degree .",
    "the mean and rms scatter of the slopes are : @xmath74 , @xmath75 ; @xmath76 , @xmath77 ; and , @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "remarkably , slope @xmath12 has much smaller scatter compared with @xmath57 as can be clearly seen in the histogram ( top left panel ) of figure  [ slope_e ] .",
    "the scatter of @xmath12 increases up to @xmath10@xmath80 for general etgs of any ellipticity for constant anisotropies and further increases by @xmath81@xmath82 for the adopted radially varying anisotropy .",
    "the scatter of @xmath12 can be increased even up to or beyond the scatter of @xmath57 by considering wildly varying anisotropies which however predict too large scatters of losvd profiles .",
    "the small scatter of @xmath12 is also suggested by the coma cluster sample for which we have : @xmath74 , @xmath83 ; @xmath84 , @xmath85 ; and , @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , it appears that @xmath49 ( or @xmath88 ) is closer to universal than @xmath11 at least within @xmath37 .",
    "figure  [ profs ] displays the predicted profiles up to @xmath89 based on the sdss sample . compared with @xmath11",
    "@xmath49 is much closer to a universal power - law profile .",
    "figure  [ profcoma ] displays the profiles of 15 coma cluster etgs directly constrained by the individually measured losvds .",
    "these profiles independently indicate that for ellipticals @xmath49 is closer to universal than @xmath11 .",
    "what is even more striking from the coma profiles is that all etgs including lenticulars appear to follow the universal profile when @xmath90 ( equation  [ eq : vrms ] ) rather than @xmath4 is used .    unlike @xmath49",
    ", the quantity @xmath91 does not exhibit a universality for a realistic galaxy embedded in a dm halo .",
    "the scatter of the slope @xmath92/d\\ln r$ ] is even larger than that of @xmath57 .",
    "this property is rooted in the fact that stellar motions ( dm motions as well ) are not self - gravitating but governed by the total mass distribution , as can be seen in equation  ( [ eq : jeans ] ) . in a pristine dm halo in which dm motions are governed by its own gravity the pps density @xmath93 exhibits a universality ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , in ` real ' dm halos hosting galaxies the pps density of dm particles @xmath94 is not universal or power - law as can be shown using our models .",
    "this property was also noticed in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "let us analyze the spherical jeans equation to see if the universality of @xmath49 can be a natural outcome of equilibrium .",
    "using equation  ( [ eq : jeans ] ) one can express a pps density - like quantity with the radial vd as follows : @xmath95}{d\\ln x}\\right ) , \\label{eq : jeansn}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 with an arbitrary reference radius @xmath100 ( see @xcite ) . in equation  ( [ eq : jeansn ] )",
    "the following symbols are used : @xmath101 with @xmath102 , and @xmath103 .    the last factor in the large parenthesis of the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : jeansn ] )",
    "is @xmath104 . in the numerator of the second factor of the right - hand side @xmath105 ( @xmath106 for @xmath107 assuming the srsic profile )",
    "is dominating as @xmath108 and @xmath109 in most cases .",
    "for some radial range , e.g.  @xmath110 , we may write @xmath111 to a good approximation . we may also write the universal pps density - like profile as @xmath112 . then we are left with @xmath113 .",
    "similarly , if we write @xmath114 for @xmath110 , we obtain @xmath115 .",
    "these relations can be used to predict a mean value @xmath116 by empirical values of @xmath117 or @xmath118 .",
    "they also imply that the intrinsic scatter of @xmath12 is comparable to that of @xmath58 but one half of that of @xmath57 .",
    "these predictions of the mean and the intrinsic scatter are consistent with the results from our galaxy models . however , as shown in the middle and right panels of figure  [ slopeplane ] these approximate relations are not obeyed by our galaxy models .",
    "our galaxy models show no correlation of @xmath12 with either @xmath58 or @xmath57 . therefore , although equilibrium can predict the mean and the scatter of the slope of @xmath49 , equilibrium itself can not generically explain its universal nature seen in our models . for simple galaxy models equilibrium demands correlations of @xmath12 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the seen universality free of such correlations implies that some other astrophysical factors and/or principles are at work in ( our models of ) real galaxies .    for",
    "a galaxy with net rotation one may assume that stars in a local volume centered at @xmath29 satisfy a virial equation @xmath119 ( similar to the equation for the whole galaxy ) where @xmath90 is given by equation  ( [ eq : vrms ] ) and @xmath120 is the gravitational potential .",
    "from this equation similar relations of @xmath12 with @xmath58 and @xmath57 can be obtained .",
    "a range of dm distribution and vd anisotropy in elliptical galaxies have been considered for investigating galaxy mass and vd profiles .",
    "the pps density - like combination @xmath49 ( or @xmath88 for general etgs ) appears to be closer to universal than @xmath11 . moreover , the universality of @xmath49 of ellipticals closely parallels the universality of the pps density of pristine dm halos ( e.g.  @xcite ) with the values of slope @xmath12 agreeing well .",
    "the pps density is known to be scale - free over three orders of magnitude in radius for n - body simulated halos .",
    "our galaxy models indicate a power - law profile of @xmath49 in the optical region , and extrapolation from our models suggests a scale - free profile over two orders of magnitude in radius .",
    "it appears then natural to suggest that the pps density - like quantity @xmath121 for any collisionless component @xmath122 in dynamical equilibrium follows a universal power - law profile at least for some radial range .",
    "examination of jeans ( or virial ) equation shows that equilibrium can predict @xmath123 giving a mean slope of @xmath124 for an empirical @xmath118 in the optical region .",
    "however , equilibrium can not generically predict a power - law profile or the lack of correlation of @xmath12 with galactic properties .",
    "what astrophysical factors and/or physical principles can be attributed to the shared universality of @xmath121 in n - body simulated pristine halos and our ellipticals ?",
    "total mass profiles have no similarity between them .",
    "moreover , the physical formation process is quite different .",
    "the pristine halo has formed through fast collapse , major and minor mergers , and accretion .",
    "only dissipationless processes are involved . on the other hand ,",
    "an etg is believed to form through merging of disk galaxies and/or pre - existing etgs . in the formation of the stellar",
    "disk dissipational physics plays the essential role and consequently the total density deviates from the nfw @xcite profile of the pristine halo and gets much steeper in the central region .",
    "the shared universality of @xmath121 despite large differences in mass profiles , structures and formation histories between pristine dm halos and etgs suggests that the universality is not an outcome of specific astrophysical factors but reflects a fundamental physical principle / nature governing collisionless systems . for coma cluster etgs maximum entropy models ignoring observed losvd profiles , as shown in the right - most panel of figure  [ profcoma ] ,",
    "resemble best - fit models in a statistical sense .",
    "this result is in line with the finding by @xcite that flattening of an etg by stellar anisotropy maximizes the entropy for a given density distribution .",
    "however , the relevance of maximum entropy principle for collisionless systems under gravity is not well understood at present .",
    "perhaps , dynamical mixing / relaxation may be responsible for the universality ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    while @xmath121 appears to be universal , total mass density @xmath11 ( not to mention the component density @xmath125 )",
    "is determined by other physics .",
    "for example , purely radial collapse scenario by @xcite gives @xmath126 while inclusion of non - radial motions can give a profile similar to the nfw ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in etgs baryonic physics is responsible for the steep profile @xmath127 with @xmath128 in the optical region .",
    "the author is indebted to jens thomas for providing him with unpublished results on coma cluster etgs and useful discussions .",
