    "the most sophisticated approach to high energy hadronic interactions is the so - called gribov - regge theory @xcite .",
    "this is an effective field theory , which allows multiple interactions to happen `` in parallel '' , with phenomenological objects called _ pomerons _ representing elementary interactions @xcite .",
    "using the general rules of field theory , one may express cross sections in terms of a couple of parameters characterizing the pomeron .",
    "a big disadvantage of grt implementations was so far the fact that cross sections and particle production are not calculated consistently : the fact that energy needs to be shared between many pomerons in case of multiple scattering is well taken into account when considering particle production ( in particular in monte carlo applications ) , but not for cross sections @xcite .",
    "another problem is that at high energies , one also needs a consistent approach to include both soft and hard processes .",
    "the latter are usually treated in the framework of the parton model , which only allows the calculation of inclusive cross sections .",
    "we consider now a new approach called parton - based gribov - regge theory , in order to solve the above - mentioned problems .",
    "we use both the language of pomerons ( as in gribov - regge theory ) in order to calculate probabilities ( and related to this : cross sections ) and the language of strings ( to treat particle production ) .",
    "but we treat these both aspects in a consistent fashion .",
    "this is the really new and attractive feature of our approach .",
    "the price to be paid are great technical difficulties which took us a couple of years to solve them .",
    "for all the details and applications of the corresponding monte carlo program nexus  3 see @xcite .",
    "we will discus the basic features of the new approach in a qualitative fashion .",
    "it is an effective theory based on effective elementary interactions .",
    "multiple interactions happen in parallel in proton - proton collisions .",
    "an elementary interaction is referred to as pomeron , and can be either elastic ( uncut pomeron ) or inelastic ( cut pomeron ) .",
    "the spectators of each proton form a remnant , see fig .",
    "[ allin1]a .    -0.5 cm",
    "-1.5 cm    -.5 cm    since a pomeron is finally identified with two strings , the pomeron aspect ( to obtain probabilities ) and the string aspect ( to obtain particles ) are treated in a completely consistent way .",
    "_ in both cases energy sharing is considered in a rigorous way , and in both cases all pomerons are identical . _    this theory provides also a consistent treatment for hard and soft processes : each pomeron can be expressed in terms of contributions of different types , soft , hard and semihard , cf .",
    "[ allin1]b .",
    "a hard pomeron stands for a hard interaction between valence quarks of initial hadrons .",
    "a semihard one stands for an interaction between sea quarks but in which a perturbative process involves in the middle .",
    "no perturbative process occures at all in soft pomeron .",
    "a pomeron is an elementary interaction . but",
    "those pomerons may interact with each other at high energy @xcite , then they give another type of interaction called _",
    "enhanced diagram_. there are many types of enhanced diagrams depending on the number of pomerons for each vertices and on the number of vertices . in our model , effective first order of triple and 4-pomeron vertices ( y and x diagrams see fig .",
    "[ allin1]c ) are enough to cure unitarity problem which occure at high energy without this kind of diagram @xcite .",
    "indeed , y - type diagrams are screening corrections which are negative contributions to the cross - section .",
    "x diagram is anti - screening .",
    "the inelastic contributions ( cut enhanced diagrams on fig .",
    "[ allin1]d ) of this diagrams contribute to the increase of the fluctuations in particle production .",
    "thanks to a monte carlo , first the collision configuration is determined : i.e. the number of each type of pomerons exchanged between the projectile and target is fixed and the initial energy is shared between the pomerons and the two remnants . then particle production is accounted from two kinds of sources , remnant decay and cut pomeron . a pomeron may be regarded as a two - layer ( soft ) parton ladder attached to projectile and target remnants through its two legs .",
    "each leg is a color singlet , of type q@xmath0 , qqq or @xmath0@xmath0@xmath0 from the sea , and then each cut pomeron is regarded as two strings , cf .",
    "[ nexus1]a .",
    "-1.cm    -.5",
    "cm    it is a natural idea to take quarks and antiquarks from the sea as string ends for soft pomeron in nexus , because an arbitary number of pomerons may be involved .",
    "in addition to this soft pomerons , hard and semihard pomerons are treated differently . to give a proper description of deep inelastic scattering data , hard and",
    "some of semihard pomerons are connected to the valance quarks of the hadron .",
    "thus , besides the three valence quarks , each remnant has additionally quarks and antiquarks to compensate the flavours of the string ends , as shown in fig .",
    "[ nexus1]c . according to its number of quarks and antiquarks and to the phase space",
    ", a remnant decays into mesons , antibaryons and baryons @xcite .",
    "therefore , from remnant decay , baryon production is favored due to the initial valence quarks and in particular produce strong leading particle effects ( two wings in the rapidity spectra ) for proton and @xmath1 .",
    "considering energy sharing , enhanced diagram and identical elementary interactions , a great number of particle distributions can be calculated within nexus  3 for any kind of hadronic and nuclear interaction @xcite . as an example , fig .",
    "[ proton ] depicts the rapidity spectra for proton and anti - proton production for 2 different energies .",
    "the different contributions for the particle production ( cut pomeron : dashed - dotted line , remnants : dashed line and dotted line ) show that the assimetry between baryon and anti - baryon production comes from the remnant contributions .",
    "proton and anti - proton rapidity spectra for na49 @xcite ( 158 gev lab ) ( top ) and rhic ( 200 gev cms ) ( bottom ) energies .",
    "the remnant contributions are the dashed and the dotted lines , the dashed - dotted line is the pomeron contribution and the full line is the sum . ]        at low energy ( 158 gev lab ) , nexus  is in good agreement with na49 data  @xcite . for rhic energy ( 200 gev cms ) , the prediction shows that the cut pomeron distribution becomes dominant at midrapidity even for the proton , which leads to reduce the assymetry in this region ( ratio closer to 1 ) .",
