    "i carry out a formal analysis of multiphoton absorption which is called simultaneous , if it is described by the proper quantum - electrodynamic expressions . if a rate equation approximation turns out to be satisfactory , i can also distinguish linked multiphoton absorption  which are rendered nonlinear by the decay of intermediate states  and",

    "<S> i classify multiphoton absorption into separable , linked , and simultaneous processes . </S>",
    "<S> the first and second types can be distinguished when the rate - equation approximation is valid whereas the third type refers to the case when the full quantum - electrodynamic description of multiphoton absorption is essential . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , i solve the rate equations without decay processes analytically which yields the linearity theorem of multiphoton absorption , i.e. , even if many photons are absorbed the interaction with the light field is linear and i have the case of separable multiphoton absorption . </S>",
    "<S> next i investigate a short - pulse approximation in which i first solve the rate equations without decay processes and then solve only rate equations for the ensuing decay . </S>",
    "<S> finally , i examine the full rate equations and derive a successive approximation of the underlying volterra integral equation leading to linked multiphoton absorption by the involved decay widths . </S>",
    "<S> the three methods are applied to a nitrogen atom in intense and ultrafast x  rays from free - electron lasers  ( fels ) . </S>",
    "<S> the linearity theorem barely approximates the results in the presence of decay processes . </S>",
    "<S> i find that the short - pulse approximation is suitable for lower charge states and for  @xmath0  xray  pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the successive approximation gives excellent agreement with the numerically - exact solution of the rate equations where , however , higher orders need to be taken into account .    , electronic mail ] </S>"
