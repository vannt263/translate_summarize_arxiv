    "since the discovery of cmb anisotropies by the cobe team ( smoot 1992 ) there has been rapid progress on the observational front , culminating with publication earlier this year of evidence for multiple acoustic peaks in the cmb power spectrum ( netterfield 2001 ; lee 2001 ; halverson 2001 ) .",
    "it has long been known that accurate measurements of the cmb anisotropies can be used to estimate parameters characterising the primordial fluctuations , the geometry of the universe and its matter content ( _ e.g. _ jungman etal 1996 ; bond , efstathiou & tegmark 1997 ; zaldarriaga , spergel & seljak 1997 ) .",
    "in fact , the most recent measurements paint a gratifyingly consistent picture compatible with the simplest models of inflation ( _ i.e. _ a spatially flat universe with scale - invariant adiabatic fluctuations ) .",
    "furthermore , the derived value of the baryon density @xmath2 appears to be consistent with the value @xmath3 inferred from primordial nucleosynthesis and deuterium abundance measurements from quasar absorption line spectra ( burles , nollett & turner 2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "it has also long been known that there are significant degeneracies amongst cosmological parameters estimated from cmb anisotropies , _",
    "i.e. _ parameter combinations exist that produce nearly identical cmb power spectra ( bond 1994 ; efstathiou & bond 1999 , hereafter eb99 ) .",
    "the best known is the _ geometrical degeneracy _ between the matter and vacuum energy densities , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the curvature @xmath6 .",
    "this degeneracy is almost exact and precludes reliable estimates of either @xmath5 or the hubble parameter @xmath7 from measurements of the cmb anisotropies alone .",
    "the existence of parameter degeneracies means that the best fitting parameters and their errors can be extremely sensitive to the chosen parameter set ( _ e.g. _ whether the universe is assumed to be spatially flat ) and to adopted ` prior distributions ' ( _ e.g. _ observational constraints on the hubble constant ) .",
    "this complicates the interpretation of cmb anisotropy parameter studies and the intercomparison of limits determined by different authors .",
    "almost all cmb parameter analyses ( with the noteable exception of the work of tegmark and collaborators , ( tegmark 1999 ; tegmark , zaldarriaga & hamilton , 2001 ; wang , tegmark & zaldarriaga , 2001 ) have ignored a tensor component ( see for example , lange 2001 ; jaffe 2001 ; de bernardis 2001 ; pryke 2001 ; stompor 2001 ) .",
    "this special case is certainly interesting because a wide class of inflationary models predict a negligible contribution from tensor modes .",
    "indeed it has been argued persuasively that the absence of tensor modes is generic to any model in which the inflaton potential is related to the higgs sector of a grand unified theory ( lyth 1997 ) .",
    "however , so little is known about inflation ( if indeed inflation occured ) that it may be dangerous to neglect a tensor mode , particularly if some cosmological parameters of interest are sensitive to tensor modes .",
    "in fact , in single - field inflation models the relative amplitudes of the tensor and scalar tensor modes ( @xmath8 ) and their spectral indices ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) are related to the inflaton potential and its first two derivatives ( _ e.g. _ see hoffman & turner 2001 for a recent discussion ) . in this class of model",
    "the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath9 is model dependent while the relation between @xmath9 and @xmath8 depends only on the validity of the slow - roll approximation .",
    "however , even the latter relation can be violated in multi - field inflationary models .",
    "these relations may also be violated in some superstring inspired models ( see _ e.g. _ lidsey , wands & copeland 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "examples of the latter include the pre - big bang model of veneziano and collaborators ( _ e.g. _ buonnono , damour & veneziano , 1999 ) which it is argued can lead to ` blue ' scalar spectral indices ( @xmath11 ) , and the ekpyrotic scenario ( khoury , ovrut , steinhardt & turok 2001 ) which produces a strongly blue tensor mode spectrum .",
    "the point of view taken in this paper is to define a minimal parameter set on the assumption that the primordial fluctuations are gaussian , adiabatic and featureless ( _ i.e. _ defined by power - law spectral indices ) .",
    "thus the minimal model is specified by @xmath12 parameters : four parameters specifying the amplitudes and spectral indices of scalar and tensor components ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath10 and @xmath9 , see section 2 for more precise definitions ) , four parameters defining the matter content and curvature of the universe ( @xmath2 , @xmath15 , @xmath5 , @xmath16 ) and a single parameter @xmath17 quantifying the optical depth to thomson scattering since the universe was reionized .",
    "however , as pointed out by eb99 , including a tensor component with no assumed constraints between the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath9 and @xmath14 introduces an new major degeneracy between cosmological parameters that we will call the _ tensor degeneracy _ in this paper .",
    "this degeneracy has a dramatic effect on the permitted ranges of some parameters , in particular the baryon and cold dark matter densities @xmath2 and @xmath15 .",
    "one approach to these degeneracies is to apply brute - force maximum likelihood analysis to a large parameter set ( see the papers by tegmark and collaborators ) . here",
    "we show that the observational data has now improved to the point that a simple principal component analysis of the fisher matrix defined by the data identifies the major degeneracy directions ( geometrical and tensor ) and provides a useful first approximation to the likelihood function . using the principal components it is easy to analyse the correlations between physical parameters introduced by the tensor degeneracy and to assess the effects of introducing external ( non - cmb ) constraints on the parameters .",
    "we use the compilation of band power estimates @xmath18 and their covariance matrix @xmath19 computed by wang ( 2001 , hereafter wtz01 ) from @xmath20 cmb anisotropy measurements .",
    "these band power estimates include a model for calibration and beam errors ( see wtz01 for further details ) . each band power estimate is related to the power spectrum @xmath21 of the cmb anisotropies by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the window function for each band power ( also computed by wtz01 ) .",
    "these band - power estimates are plotted in fig . 1 .",
    "also plotted in this figure is a fiducial model with the following parameters : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "these parameters provide an extremely good fit to the observations and are very close to the concordance values determined by wtz01 and the author from a full likelihood analysis .",
    "the addition of a small tensor component has little effect on the fit shown in fig . 1 , but is introduced to regularize the fisher matrix of equation ( [ 2.2 ] ) .",
    "3.0 truein    3.7 truein    given the covariance matrix of the observations , we can form the fisher matrix for the ( mean subtracted ) parameter set @xmath34 : @xmath35 in defining the parameter set @xmath36 , we use @xmath37 and @xmath38 rather than @xmath2 and @xmath15 and @xmath39 rather than @xmath16 .",
    "the latter expresses the geometrical degeneracy ( see eb99 ) , since if all parameters other than @xmath16 and @xmath5 are held fixed , the condition @xmath40 preserves the positions of the acoustic peaks for small variations of the parameters about those of the fiducial model .",
    "the normalization parameter @xmath13 is defined following eb99 so that @xmath41 is the mean band power ( @xmath42 ) of a model relative to that of the fiducial model plotted in fig .",
    "1 . with this definition",
    ", @xmath13 is observationally well constrained and is largely decoupled from variations in cosmology and the optical depth @xmath17 ( unlike measures of the amplitude related to low multipoles ) .",
    "the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath14 is defined so that @xmath43 . with these definitions",
    ", we can compute the fisher matrix ( [ 2.2 ] ) from derivatives of the power spectra @xmath44 and @xmath45 , as in standard analyses of parameter forecasting ( jungman 1996 , bond 1997 ) .",
    "alternatively , we could compute the hessian matrix by estimating second derivatives of the likelihood function around the maximum likelihood value either directly or by summing over first and second derivatives of @xmath46 . in most situationa using either the fisher and hessian matrixes should give closely similar results , and in fact , the second derivatives of @xmath46 are often ignored in order to stabilise numerical evaluations of the hessian ( see _ e.g. _ press 1992 ) .    having computed the fisher matrix , we diagonalise it ,",
    "@xmath47 the matrix @xmath48 defines a set of principal components , @xmath49 , _",
    "i.e. _ orthogonal linear combinations of the original parameters , @xmath50 such that the variance of the component @xmath51 is equal to @xmath52 .",

    "( the device used here , of varying low order principal components to produce degenerate pairs of models , was used by eb99 to investigate parameter degeneracies for the map and planck satellites . ) one model has @xmath86 and the other has @xmath87 .",
    "the models were intentionally chosen to have similar values of @xmath5 , consequently the high baryon density model has a low value of @xmath7 which one might argue is incompatible with independent measurements of the hubble constant ( freedman 2001 ) . however , our purpose here is to show how the constaints on @xmath2 derived from cmb anisotropies _ alone _ are weakened when tensor modes are included .",
    "the high and low baryon density models are compared to the data and to the fiducial model in fig .",
    "despite the very different parameter values , the models produce almost identical cmb power spectra by construction .",
    "the exact likelihood analysis ( fig .",
    "2b ) shows that the model with the high baryon density is compatible with the data at about the @xmath88 level . the low baryon density model is formally excluded by the data at a high level of significance ( @xmath89 ) because it fails to match the height of the first acoustic peak . this is a characteristic feature of models with a low baryon density",
    "nevertheless , the diagram is interesting because it shows that that the lower limits on @xmath2 are extremely sensitive to any residual systematic errors that might affect the peak heights ( see _ e.g. _ de bernardis 2001 , figure 1 ) .",
    "the reader might question the usefulness of the results presented in the previous section .",
    "firstly , the principal component analysis provides only an approximate description of the parameter degeneracies , whereas they emerge precisely from a brute force maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "secondly , models at the extreme ends of the ranges allowed by the tensor degeneracy have unusual parameters ( for example , the model with @xmath90 in fig .",
    "3b has a low hubble constant and a high value of the scalar spectral index ) and so are surely excluded by other observational constraints .",
    "we discuss each of these points in turn .      _",
    "( i ) effective dimensionality : _ the main use of the principal component analysis is to assess the effective dimensionality of the space of acceptable models within the multidimensional space defined by the physical parameters @xmath36 and to assess whether this effective dimensionality is sensitive to changes of the parameter set .",
    "for example , let us assume that we are interested in the values of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath15 .",
    "the principal component analysis tells us that most of the variance of these parameters is contributed by only two poorly constrained principal components .",
    "the values of these parameters are therefore affected by major parameter degeneracies which can only be removed by imposing external constraints or by performing a fundamentally different type of cmb exeperiment .",
    "for example , the effects of the tensor degeneracy on @xmath2 and @xmath15 can be broken by extending the cmb measurents to much higher multipoles ( see eb99 ) and/or by setting limits on a tensor component from an analysis of a b - type polarization pattern in the cmb ( see _ e.g. _ kamionkowski & jaffe , 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "_ ( ii ) complementary information : _ cmb parameter degeneracies can be broken by invoking complementary information .",
    "a well known example is the combination of type ia supernovae measurements with the cmb to break the geometrical degeneracy ( see _ e.g. _ de bernardis 2001 for a recent analysis ) . wtz01",
    "break the tensor degeneracy by combining the cmb data with a number of constraints including estimates of the power spectrum on small scales from observations of the ly@xmath91 forest ( croft 2001 ) and limits on the hubble constant from hst hubble key project ( freedman 2001 ) .",
    "the problem here is that it becomes progressively more difficult to assess whether parameter values are affected by systematic errors as more external constraints are applied , particularly if the external constraints involve complex observations and assumptions .",
    "( for example , how can we test empirically whether density fluctuations in the inter - galactic medium as traced by the ly@xmath91 forest match those of the dark matter ? ) . even if the parameter values are shown to remain consistent as external constraints are applied ,",
    "there is no guarantee that the final combined likelihood distribution will be accurate .",
    "ideally , we would like to apply as small a number of external constraints as possible using data sets with well controlled errors .",
    "the fisher matrix analysis of the previous section offers a guide as to which external constraints will be most effective at breaking degeneracies .",
    "the effects of external constraints can easily be assessed using the fisher matrix : let @xmath92 be the covariance matrix of the parameters @xmath36 from external constraints , then the covariance matrix after combining with the cmb is @xmath93 as menstioned in section 2 , the models plotted in fig .",
    "3 were chosen by construction to have similar values of @xmath5 , so it is clear that combining the cmb results with constraints on @xmath5 from type ia supernovae observations will have little effect on the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath15 .",
    "constraints on the hubble constant will be more effective in narrowing the range of allowed values of @xmath2 and @xmath15 . however , from fig .",
    "2 we can see that the tensor degeneracy exhibits a strong correlation between @xmath2 , @xmath15 , and the scalar spectral index @xmath10 .",
    "even a relatively poor constraint on the scalar spectral index will lead to a sharp tightening of the @xmath2 and @xmath15 error contours .",
    "( a constraint @xmath94 on the spectral index will narrow the error on the baryon density to @xmath95 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath96 . ) this suggests that the recent estimates of the galaxy power spectrum from the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( percival 2001 ) will be highly effective at breaking the tensor degeneracy , leading to tight constraints on the matter content of the universe .",
    "this is borne out by a detailed analysis presented in a companion paper ( efstathiou 2001 ) .",
