    ", a localized input evolves into either of these two stable solutions , depending on the initial amplitude .    while the pinned modes may be stable against small perturbations under the combined action of the self - defocusing nonlinearity ( @xmath329 ) and unsaturated nonlinear gain ( @xmath354 )",
    ", one may expect fragility of these states against finite - amplitude perturbations .",
    "it was found indeed that sufficiently strong perturbations destroy those modes @xcite .      in the case of the sf nonlinearity , @xmath328 ,",
    "the pinned - mode branches  are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , all of them being unstable without the cubic loss , i.e. , at @xmath354 . for the present parameters , all the solutions originate , in the linear limit , from the power - balance point @xmath355 .",
    "the localized modes remain stable even at very large values of @xmath194 .",
    "lastly , in the case of @xmath213 , when the nonlinearity is represented solely by the cubic gain or loss , all the localized states are unstable under the cubic gain , @xmath75 , and stable under the cubic loss , @xmath74 .",
    "this article presents a limited review of theoretical results obtained in recently studied 1d and 2d models , which predict a generic method for supporting stable spatial solitons in dissipative optical media , based on the use of the linear gain applied in narrow active segments ( hss ,  hot spots \" ) implanted into the lossy waveguide . in some cases",
    ", the unsaturated cubic localized gain may also support stable spatial solitons , which is a counter - intuitive finding . in view of the limited length of the article",
    ", it combined a review of the broad class of such models with a more detailed consideration of selected 1d models where exact or approximate analytical solutions for the dissipative solitons are available .",
    "naturally , the analytical solutions , in the combination with their numerical counterparts , provide a deeper understanding of the underlying physical models .",
    "a relevant issue for the further development of the topic is a possibility of the existence of _ asymmetric modes _ supported by symmetric double hss , i.e. , the analysis of the spontaneous symmetry breaking in this setting @xcite .",
    "thus far , such a result was not demonstrated in a clear form .",
    "another challenging extension may be a possibility of _ dragging _ a pinned 1d or 2d soliton by a hs _ moving _ across a lossy medium .",
