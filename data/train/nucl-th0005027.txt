    "the role played by the effects of final state interaction ( fsi ) in electro - disintegration processes is a very relevant issue , for they may in principle hinder the extraction of reliable information not only on nuclear structure , but also on fundamental hadronic properties in the medium , which could be obtained from different kinds of lepton scattering processes off nuclear targets .",
    "apart from the few - body systems at low energies , for which exact solutions of the schroedinger equation in the continuum are becoming to be available ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , the treatment of fsi effects in complex systems at intermediate and high energies still requires the use of several approximations .",
    "this concerns both the semi - inclusive processes @xmath3 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and the fully inclusive process @xmath4 , for which several methods have been proposed with conflicting results ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "most of these approaches rely on the use of the glauber multiple scattering theory , assuming that the struck nucleon , after @xmath5 absorption , is on shell and propagates in the medium with total energy @xmath6 ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the three - momentum transfer and the momentum of the struck nucleon before interaction , respectively ) . the latter assumption , which is a very reasonable one at @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the bjorken scaling variable  @xcite , @xmath11 the four - momentum transfer , and @xmath12 the nucleon mass )",
    ", could be questionable at higher or lower values of @xmath13 , where the struck nucleon , after @xmath5 absorption , is far off - shell ; moreover , even at high values of @xmath14 , the two nucleon relative energy might be not sufficiently high to justify the use of the glauber high energy approximation , so that a careful consideration of the two - nucleon kinematics is called for . as a matter of fact",
    ", it has been shown  @xcite that existing data on the inclusive electro - disintegration of the deuteron , @xmath15 @xcite , correspond , at @xmath16 , to a very low relative energy of the two nucleon final state even if @xmath17 is very large , and that they can be satisfactorily explained by using for the continuum state the solution of the non relativistic schroedinger equation .",
    "it is however clear that , given a fixed value of @xmath13 , if @xmath17 ( i.e. @xmath18 ) is further increased , inelastic processes could become operative and the schroedinger approach becomes inadequate . within these kinematical conditions ,",
    "i.e. at high relative energies of the @xmath19-pair in the continuum , the glauber approach has been frequently used to calculate fsi effects , which , however , requires several approximations in case of complex nuclei . in the deuteron case",
    ", fsi effects can be calculated exactly within both the schroedinger and the glauber approaches .",
    "it is just the aim of this paper to present the results of such a calculation for the inclusive electro - disintegration of the deuteron @xmath15 in the quasi - elastic region , i.e. at @xmath20 , or @xmath21 . in order to better display the effects of the fsi",
    ", our results will be presented not only in terms of cross sections , but also in terms of y - scaling functions@xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in chapter ii the basic formalism of inclusive processes within the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) is recalled ; the formalism pertaining to the treatment of the fsi within the schroedinger and the glauber approaches is illustrated in chapter iii ; the results of calculations are given in chapter iv ; the conclusions are drawn in chapter v.",
    "in this section the relevant formulae describing the inclusive cross section @xmath15 will be recalled . in the one photon exchange approximation , depicted in fig.[pict1 ] , the inclusive cross section reads as follows @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the initial and final eigenfunctions of the intrinsic nuclear hamiltonian , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the electromagnetic currents of the electron and the deuteron , respectively , and @xmath28 is a kinematical factor ( see below ) .",
    "the 4-momenta of the initial and final electrons in the laboratory system are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , the four momentum transfer is @xmath31 , and the orientation of the coordinate system is defined by @xmath32 .    at high energies",
    "the electron mass can be disregarded , so that @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the scattering angle .",
    "the following relations will be used in what follows : @xmath35 & & \\left | { \\bf   q}\\right| = \\left | q_z\\right| = \\sqrt{q^2+\\nu^2}. \\label{kin22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in pwia , depicted in fig .",
    "[ pict2 ] , the three - nucleon momenta in the deuteron , before interaction , are @xmath36 and , after interaction , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ; the relative and center of mass ( cm ) momenta are @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the pwia cross section in the lab system has the following form ( @xmath41 ) : @xmath42\\times\\nonumber \\\\&&\\phantom{{d^3 \\sigma \\over   d \\omega   d { \\cal e } ' } = \\int } \\left [ \\frac{m^2    d { \\bf p}_2 } { e_1'e_2 } \\delta ( m_d+\\nu -e_1'-e_2 ) \\right ] \\ n(|{\\bf p}| ) , \\label{pwia}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 refer to the longitudinal ( transverse ) part of the nucleon current operator , @xmath44 are the corresponding well - known kinematical factors @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the nucleon momentum distribution in the deuteron @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the non relativistic deuteron wave function , with the two nucleon relative co - ordinate given by @xmath49 .",
    "it is a common practice to express the cross section ( [ pwia ] ) in terms of the free electron - nucleon cross section for an on mass - shell nucleon , i.e. to extrapolate the rosenbluth cross section to the off - mass shell case @xcite .",
    "since energy conservation in the two cases is different ( whereas the three momentum conservation is the same ) the extrapolation unavoidably requires additional , _ ad hoc _ assumptions . in this paper",
    "we adopt the prescription of @xcite , according to which the hit nucleon is considered to be on - shell , i.e. with a four momentum equal to the one of a free nucleon , _ _ viz . _ _",
    "@xmath50 , and in ( [ pwia ] ) the replacement @xmath51 is done , so that @xmath52 ; by this way , the electromagnetic vertex of the nuclear tensor corresponds to that of a free nucleon , evaluated at the same @xmath53 , but at the transferred energy @xmath54 instead of @xmath55 , which means that the nucleon hadronic tensor has to be evaluated for @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "by such a procedure one obtains @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the extrapolated electron -nucleon cross section for an off - mass shell nucleon @xcite , @xmath60 , and the limits of integration , which are obtained from the energy conservation provided by the @xmath61- function , are as follows @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the mandelstam variable for the @xmath64 vertex @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the scaling variable according to @xcite @xmath67 when the value of @xmath14 becomes large enough , one has @xmath68 and the dependence of @xmath69 upon @xmath70 becomes very weak .",
    "in such a case eq .",

    "such an approximation , which has been carefully investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , turns out to be valid within few percents , provided @xmath76 .",
    "it is clear therefore , that at large values of @xmath14 the following quantity ( the _ non relativistic scaling function _ ) @xmath77 will be directly related to the longitudinal momentum distribution @xmath78 thus the condition for the occurrence of non relativistic @xmath66-scaling is that eq .",

    "in the calculation of the fsi , depicted in fig . [ pict3 ] , it is more convenient to perform calculations in the frame where the interacting @xmath19-pair in the final state is at rest .",

    "it is well known that the non relativistic deuteron momentum distributions calculated with different realistic potentials , _ viz . _",

    "the difference between the schroedinger and glauber results is strongly reduced at low values of @xmath66 ( @xmath9 ) , where , being the target nucleon almost free , the small - scattering - angle requirement necessary for the validity of the glauber approximation , is probably better fulfilled .    a common approximation , adopted by various authors in the glauber type calculation of the fsi , is to consider that at @xmath184 the asymptotic @xmath179 should be used .",

    "\\2 ) the glauber results overestimate the schroedinger results at low values of @xmath14 , and underestimate them at high values of @xmath14 .",
    "the reason for such a disagreement between the two approaches , which is particularly relevant at large values of @xmath21 ( large , negative values of @xmath66 ) , has to be ascribed to the fact that at @xmath21 , the direction of the ejected nucleon sizably differs from the direction of the momentum transfer .",

    "<S> the role of the final state interactions ( fsi ) in the inclusive quasi - elastic disintegration of the deuteron is investigated treating the two - nucleon final state within the exact continuum solutions of the non - relativistic schroedinger equation , as well as within the glauber multiple scattering approach . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that for values of the bjorken scaling variable @xmath0 both approaches provide similar results , unless the case @xmath1 , where they appreciably disagree . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that present experimental data , which are mostly limited to a region of four - momentum transfer ( @xmath2 ) where the center - of - mass energy of the final state is below the pion threshold production , can be satisfactorily reproduced by the approach based on the exact solution of the schroedinger equation and not by the glauber approach . </S>",
    "<S> it is also pointed out that the latter , unlike the former , does not satisfy the inelastic coulomb sum rule , the violation being of the order of about 20% .    </S>",
