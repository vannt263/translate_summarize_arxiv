    "quasar absorption line analysis is a powerful tool for studying the properties of different types of gas in the universe , including gas around quasars , disks and halos of intervening galaxies , and high velocity clouds .",
    "this paper focuses on the absorption line systems produced by five intervening galaxies along the line of sight toward the quasar pg  @xmath0 .",
    "the most difficult part of analyzing quasar absorption lines is connecting the velocity space absorption profiles that are observed in the quasar s spectrum with the physical properties of the gas that is creating the profile .",
    "in particular , trying to associate intervening absorption systems with particular types of structures in galaxies has proven to be difficult .",
    "two methods for making this association are imaging the field around the quasar and looking for galaxies at the same redshifts as the absorption systems , and indirectly comparing properties determined from the absorption profiles with physical properties and processes that are known to occur in galaxy halos and disks .",
    "there are difficulties with each , however .",
    "imaging a galaxy becomes practically impossible for large redshifts , dwarf galaxy hosts , or galaxies at small impact parameters from the quasar .",
    "on the other hand , velocity profiles can be very complicated , involving rotation , thermal components , gaseous expulsion , collisions , unresolved features , and unrelated absorption .",
    "the mg0.1emii  @xmath6 doublet is a key identification tool for absorption systems , due to its strength , @xmath7 doublet ratio , and location in the optical for moderate redshifts ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "absorbers can be divided into two different types : weak , with equivalent widths @xmath9 , and strong , with equivalent widths @xmath10 .",
    "the division of @xmath11   was historically chosen as an artifact of observational sensitivity @xcite , however it also may have some significance as the approximate transition point in the neutral hydrogen between optically thin and optically thick @xcite .",
    "weak systems can be further subdivided into two main categories .",
    "single cloud weak absorbers are isolated , narrow clouds with doppler parameters @xmath12   @xcite .",
    "multiple cloud weak absorbers are a collection of single , weak clouds within a narrow , related velocity range ( e.g. @xmath13  ) with a total equivalent width of @xmath9 .",
    "typically , strong absorbers are saturated , and weak ones are unsaturated , however there are important exceptions to this generalization .",
    "one example of such a case would be a multiple cloud system with a total equivalent width greater than @xmath11  ( and therefore classified as a strong system ) , which in actuality is a collection of unsaturated weak clouds . also , it should be noted that an unresolved weak cloud can be saturated while not being completely black in the core .",
    "this is a very important phenomenon to be aware of when modeling very narrow weak clouds , as it can strongly affect the modeling results @xcite .",
    "single cloud weak absorbers have properties consistent with small pockets or sheets of low ionization gas associated with highly - ionized extended gas structures , but most are not known to be associated with any intervening galaxy @xcite . one multiple cloud weak absorber has been hypothesized to be a superwind coming off of one or a pair of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "others are thought to be collections of weak clouds all belonging to the same host galaxy as extensions of the strong absorber population .    in the past",
    ", high resolution coverage of multiple ionic transitions enabled the modeling of physical conditions of quasar absorption line systems at low redshift @xcite .",
    "this paper is not the first to analyze intermediate redshift , @xmath14 , systems along the line of sight toward a quasar , however few other absorption systems at that redshift have been analyzed to the level of detail we present here .",
    "previous detailed studies that have used the same modeling method include @xcite , who modeled what they believe to be a double galaxy at redshift @xmath15 along the line of sight toward pg  @xmath16 , which had drastically different high ionization structure for each of the galaxies , and @xcite , who considered an absorption system at @xmath17 toward pg  @xmath18 which was deficient in , potentially due to a low metallicity or very high ionization broad absorption phase .",
    "several weak absorbers , single and multiple cloud , have been modeled in detail @xcite .",
    "we have also recently completed a similar study of six absorption systems along the pg  @xmath19 , pg  @xmath20 , and pg  @xmath21 lines of sight @xcite .",
    "each new system studied in such detail has added new insights into the mix of processes that determine gas structure formation .",
    "the number of detailed studies at @xmath14 has been limited because both high resolution and coverage of many different absorption species are required to accurately constrain a model .",
    "pg  @xmath0 is ideal for a study like this because it is bright in both the optical and uv , and it has five intervening absorbers in one high resolution spectrum .",
    "these systems were discussed in an earlier paper by @xcite , however they did not have the benefit of the high resolution uv coverage of many important transitions by the space telescope imaging spectrograph onboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst_/stis ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present photoionization and collisional ionization models of the subcomponents of the five intervening systems , also known as clouds , which were made to determine the physical properties of the gas , such as ionization parameter and metallicity .",
    "our model clouds were ionized by the haardt - madau extragalactic background radiation @xcite .",
    "the values for the ionization parameters of the clouds are used to separate them into distinct regimes called phases .",
    "these phases , characterized by the density of the gas , are broadly divided by the different types of ionization they exhibit : high , low , or very - low .",
    "many absorption line systems show multiple phases that overlap in velocity space , but have very distinct kinematic profiles .",
    "when many absorption species are available as constraints , applying models with overlapping phases of ionization to these multi - phase systems allows for very detailed models of the absorption lines to be created .",
    "we describe our data and processing techniques in   [ d&p ] .",
    "next , we describe in depth our method for modeling quasar absorption lines in   [ mtech ]",
    ". we then present our modeling results and a discussion of their significance in ",
    "[ results ] .",
    "note that in this section , we discuss each of the five systems in separate subsections .",
    "we summarize our results in   [ sum ] , and state our conclusions in   [ conc ] .",
    "spectra from the _ hst _ , the keck i telescope , and the palomar @xmath22inch telescope were used to constrain our models .",
    "the keck i high resolution spectrometer ( hires , @xcite ) spectrum covers a wavelength range of @xmath23   to @xmath24 , with a resolution of @xmath25 and a signal - to - noise of around @xmath26 per pixel .",
    "this spectrum was reduced in the standard way using iraf , as described in @xcite .",
    "the _ hst_/stis spectrum was obtained using the e230 m grating with a @xmath27 slit width , and a central wavelength of @xmath28 .",

    "a _ hst _ faint object spectrograph ( fos ) spectrum , obtained with the g190h grating , covers a wavelength range of @xmath33   to @xmath34 , and has a resolution of @xmath35 .",
    "this spectrum was reduced as part of the qso absorption line key project @xcite .",
    "this spectrum was obtained using the spectropolarimetry mode , with a @xmath36 aperture @xcite . only the line from the @xmath37 damped absorber ( dla ) was detected in this relatively noisy spectrum . because of this , we use it primarily as a constraint on the lyman limit breaks of our systems .",
    "the ground based spectrum covering the doublet for the @xmath38 and @xmath39 systems was taken from @xcite , who used the palomar @xmath22inch telescope .",
    "this spectrum has a resolution of @xmath40 .    to fit the stis spectrum ,",
    "the echelle orders were combined into one large file , and then broken up into a few large regions .",
    "the unabsorbed sections of continuum were chosen for each region , and variable order polynomials were fit to the continuum .",
    "the spectrum was then normalized with these polynomials in order to facilitate a search for absorption features .",
    "the hires spectrum was fit with legendre polynomials as described in churchill et  al .",
    "( 2000a ) ( and references therein ) .    because the g190h fos data covered the three lyman limit breaks almost exclusively",
    ", there were very few points that could be considered continuum , and so the continuum was generally assumed to be flat in the region redward of the @xmath39 lyman limit break , and extrapolated over the lyman limit breaks .",
    "the data from all the instruments that is relevant to constraining each of the five systems is presented in figures [ fig134]-[fig057 ] .",
    "tables [ ew134]-[ew057 ] present the equivalent widths or the @xmath41 equivalent width limits for the displayed transitions .      one potential candidate and one confirmed galaxy were found to be associated with absorption systems seen toward pg  @xmath0 by @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "both were imaged with broadband filters ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and nicmos ) which allowed for the determination of the rest frame _ b _ and _ k _ magnitudes .",

    "b - k _ of @xmath49 , and an impact parameter of @xmath50  kpc .",
    "this galaxy candidate is too close to the quasar to be able to be classified morphologically , though it has a very red color , meaning it could be an elliptical galaxy or a very red spiral galaxy .",
    "the confirmed galaxy at @xmath51 has a _ b _ luminosity of @xmath52 ( from @xcite , again using @xmath47 and @xmath53 ) , a _",
    "b - k _ of @xmath54 , and an impact parameter of @xmath55  kpc .",
    "the galaxy at @xmath51 is a face on , barred spiral ; approximately sba @xcite .",
    "there are three other galaxies within @xmath56  of the quasar which are potential candidates for the @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 absorption systems , all @xmath60 magnitudes fainter than the @xmath52 galaxy associated with the @xmath51 absorber @xcite . in particular , one galaxy candidate ,",
    "if at @xmath57 , would have an impact parameter of @xmath61  kpc ( using @xmath47 and @xmath53 , as in @xcite , for consistency ) , making it a likely candidate for the strong absorber .",
    "through the use of photoionization and collisional ionization models , we constrain the ionization conditions , metallicities , chemical compositions , and kinematic makeup of five systems along the line of sight toward pg  @xmath0 .",
    "these methods are the same as were employed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "for all five systems , we began our modeling by focusing on the absorption features in the keck i / hires data , since they had the highest signal - to - noise and resolution of the spectra available . for all but the primary component of the @xmath37 system , we used the mg0.1emii  @xmath6 transitions as a `` kinematic template '' .",
    "we found a minimum number of voigt profile components required to fit the observed structure of the kinematic template transition .",
    "for the @xmath37 system , we used the  @xmath62 to determine a kinematic template for fitting the primary component , since the profiles were saturated .    for our photoionization models",
    ", we used an ionizing background spectrum determined at the redshift of each system , based on the most current haardt - madau extragalactic background radiation spectrum available @xcite .",
    "the spectrum for each redshift was determined by linearly interpolating between the tabulated redshift values .",
    "we adopted a model ionizing spectrum that included contributions from star - forming galaxies ( with a relatively high escape fraction of @xmath56% ) as well as from quasars .",
    "the effect of absorption by the intervening ly@xmath63 forest clouds was also included .",
    "a quasar - only spectrum would be harder and would generally lead to stronger high ionization absorption .",
    "we discuss the effects of using such a spectrum in   [ spec ] .    in general",
    ", it was not possible to produce the observed absorption in all ionization stages , and at all velocities , from the original kinematic template . a minimum of one to three phases of gas were required to fit all transitions in a given system .",
    "each phase can be placed into one of four different regimes : low ionization , very - low ionization , high ionization , or a general `` other '' category .",
    "clouds are defined as falling in the low ionization regime if the ionization parameter , @xmath64 , ( defined as the ratio of the number density of ionizing photons to the number density of hydrogen ) is in the range @xmath65 . in this case , the majority of the absorption would arise from low ionization clouds .",
    "clouds in the very - low ionization regime , with @xmath66 , generally give rise to significant amounts of absorption from neutral species .",
    "high ionization clouds are defined as those with @xmath67 ; they may have detected , , and/or absorption , and may , in principle be photoionized or collisionally ionized .",
    "the `` other '' category consists of clouds that do not fall cleanly into one of these regimes , either because they fall in between regimes , because they are collisionally ionized , or because they can not be constrained well enough to be classified .",
    "the ionization fraction can be defined as the ratio of neutral to total hydrogen and for our models this can be read from tables  [ val134][val057 ] .",
    "the ionization fraction is closely related to @xmath68 , but there can be a dependence on metallicity .",
    "initially , we assumed that all of the observed was made in the same phase as the .",
    "we applied photoionization models to these clouds , adjusting the parameters to fit the observed , as well as the other lower - ionization transitions , such as , , , and , when these transitions were covered . for most of our systems , this method provided adequate models of the observed lower - ionization gas . to constrain a model of a system",
    ", we first used a minimum number of voigt profiles to fit the ( or as mentioned above for the @xmath37 system ) @xcite , giving us a column density and doppler parameter value for each component .",
    "we then used cloudy , version @xmath69 @xcite , with various values of ionization parameter and metallicity , to find expected column densities for the other observed transitions .",
    "the thermal doppler parameter for each chemical element was determined using the cloud temperature given by cloudy , and combined with the doppler parameter due to turbulence / bulk motion to obtain the total model doppler parameter for that element .",
    "the turbulence / bulk motion doppler parameter was calculated based on the observed doppler parameter for the kinematic template transition .",
    "synthetic line profiles based on the model column densities and doppler parameters were convolved with the line - spread functions of the appropriate spectrograph , creating models of the contribution of the low ionization phase to all observed transitions .",
    "we adjusted the ionization parameter and metallicity to fit the observed , , and profiles , and the available and/or lyman limit features . in many cases",
    ", these models consistently produced the other observed low ionization transitions ( e.g. , , and ) .",
    "we found for our `` best - fit '' models metallicities in the range of @xmath70 for the low ionization phase , while ionization parameters were in the range of @xmath71 .",
    "our criterion for a `` best - fit '' model was that the model adequately fit the largest number of transitions with the fewest number of components . in some cases , adjustments had to be made to the abundance patterns for the model to correctly match all the observed transitions .",
    "although we considered a strict @xmath72 statistic , we found that individual pixels ( which could be influenced by blends or correlated noise ) often dominate this value .",
    "a `` by - eye '' comparison of the models to the data generally produced ionization parameters and metallicities accurate to @xmath73  dex .",
    "this process was illustrated in fig .",
    "6 of @xcite .",
    "our `` best - fit '' models of contributions from the low ionization phase are superimposed ( as dashed curves ) on the data in figures [ fig134]-[fig057 ] .    in one case ( the @xmath37 system )",
    ", this method could not fit all of the observed transitions , calling for the addition of a very - low ionization phase . in three of the systems (",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath38 , and @xmath37 ) , higher ionization transitions , such as , , and , were also observed , but could not be produced adequately by the low ionization phase clouds ( see the dot - dash curves in figures [ fig134 ] , [ fig132 ] , and [ fig057 ] ) .",
    "this was sometimes due to constraints on the ionization parameter based on very - low and low ionization transitions , and sometimes due to distinct differences between the kinematic structure of the high and low ionization phase profiles .",
    "this called for the addition of a high ionization phase in these three cases . in three systems (",
    "@xmath57 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) , an -only cloud was needed to produce all the observed hydrogen absorption . in the first two cases ,",
    "these clouds were far removed in velocity space from the rest of the absorption features .      for the primary absorption region of the @xmath37 absorber",
    ", we were unable to use as a kinematic template to determine ionization parameters consistent with the other very - low and low ionization transitions ( for any assumed metallicity ) . at first",
    ", we believed this problem to be a result of ambiguity of the absorption strength , due to saturation .",
    "however , after exploring a wide range of voigt profile fits to the , we were unable to find any model that satisfactorily fit the observed , , and .",
    "we were able to reconcile this by adding a very - low ionization phase .",
    "the kinematic template for this phase was drawn from a voigt profile fit to the . using this template we tried to determine ionization parameters and metallicities that would produce the observed , , and absorption . over the full range of parameters , and were underproduced , and abundance pattern variations were considered . the addition of a very - low ionization phase and the optimal parameters given in the `` best fit '' model ( table [ val057 ] ) are consistent with the philosophy of minimizing the required abundance pattern adjustments .",
    "the contribution of the very - low ionization phase can be seen as the dotted line in figure [ fig057 ] .",
    "the low ionization phase for @xmath37 was then constrained by , , , 0.1emiii .",
    "it is possible that very - low ionization phases would exist in other systems , however they are not necessary to explain absorption in the observed transitions in those cases . if a very - low ionization phase did exist in one of the other systems , the parameters of its low ionization phase would have to be adjusted to compensate .",
    "after the very - low and low ionization transitions had been modeled , the , , and absorption of three systems ( @xmath39 , @xmath38 , and @xmath37 ) was still underproduced . in the case of the @xmath37 system ,",
    "the higher ionization absorption at the same velocity as the low ionization absorption ( at @xmath74 and @xmath75  ) could be produced by the low ionization phase .",
    "however , for the high ionization absorption observed at other velocities , as well as the absorption in the other two systems , the kinematic profiles of the high ionization absorption were so different from that of the underlying low ionization absorption that they could only be fit by adding a high ionization phase .",
    "in the case of the @xmath37 system , the high ionization phase was unconstrained , apart from the lack of production of low ionization transitions .",
    "for the @xmath38 and @xmath39 systems , this phase was constrained by , , and .    in principle",
    ", either photoionization or collisional ionization could determine the ionization balance for the high ionization phase of a given component .",
    "we were able to differentiate between systems that required collisional ionization models and those that could be consistent with photoionization models by comparing the different absorption patterns each creates .",
    "collisionally ionized clouds tend to produce a narrow range of ionized transitions ( e.g. or or , but never all three ) , whereas photoionized clouds tend to have broader ranges .",
    "our high ionization components are shown in the figures as the dot - dashed line .",
    "the significance of the lack of a high ionization phase in the @xmath57 and @xmath51 systems will be discussed in   [ dis104 ] and   [ dis072 ] .",
    "an illustration of how the parameters of high ionization components are typically constrained by our modeling technique was given in @xcite .",
    "since the high ionization gas is in the optically thin regime , the ionization parameter can be determined from the ratio of any two high ionization transitions , independent of metallicity .",
    "the metallicity is then constrained , for that ionization parameter , based upon the and transitions , particularly for our @xmath39 and @xmath38 systems .",
    "two of our systems , @xmath57 and @xmath38 , required an additional -only cloud to be added to fill out the observed profile . in both cases , the cloud was added to fill out the blueward wing of the profile , at @xmath76 for the @xmath57 system , and at @xmath77 for the @xmath38 system . in order to get a rough idea on how the excess absorption might be produced , we considered a simple single -only cloud model for each absorbers .",
    "the metallicities of these clouds were required to be low in order not to produce metal lines at the same velocities .",
    "the @xmath39 system also required an additional component , however this cloud was a broad absorber , covering the full velocity range of the system .",
    "it primarily produced the wings of the profile .",
    "a component was added to the @xmath57 system to fill out the  @xmath78 and absorption at @xmath79 .",
    "this helped produce much of the absorption in that velocity range , but a -only cloud was still required for this system , as discussed above .",
    "also , a collisionally ionized phase was added into the @xmath57 system in order to fit the excess absorption observed at a position of @xmath80  .",
    "although the  @xmath81 is blended from @xmath82  , the  @xmath83 matches the main spike of the  @xmath81 at @xmath84  , giving us reason to believe that at least that small part is a real feature .",
    "our reasons for choosing a collisionally ionized phase , as opposed to a photoionized phase , will be discussed in  [ res104 ] .",
    "we used an input spectrum which is an updated version of the spectrum presented in @xcite .",
    "we obtained the new spectrum from @xcite , which was an extragalactic background radiation spectrum from quasars , similar to the original , but with additional contributions from star forming galaxies with an escape fraction of @xmath56% .",
    "we chose to use this spectrum , as opposed to the older one , because our systems exist during an epoch of increased star formation ( @xmath85 ) so that we would expect some stellar contribution .",
    "the primary effect of using a qso - only spectrum is an increase in high ionization absorption contributed by the lower ionization clouds , which is a result of this spectrum being harder than the spectrum with star forming galaxies . as we discuss in   [ results ] , all of our models either produced too much high ionization absorption to begin with , or had the high ionization gas so far offset from the lower ionization gas that making more in the lower ionization phases would not adequately model the data .",
    "a more thorough study of the effects of varying the spectral shape on models of some other absorption systems is presented in @xcite .",
    "we now present our numerical constraints on the properties of the five systems we analyzed in the line of sight toward pg  @xmath0 .",
    "photoionization modeling was used to determine the range of acceptable ionization parameters ( @xmath68 ) and metallicites ( @xmath86 ) , when adequate constraints were available .",
    "collisional ionization was also considered and temperatures ( @xmath87 ) were constrained for possible collisional models .",

    "the tick marks in the figures indicate the locations of model clouds from the tables , as noted specifically in the figure captions .",
    "the redshifts given for each system are optical depth weighted mean values derived from the transitions observed by keck i / hires . because the lyman limit break due to the @xmath39 system affects the modeling of the @xmath38 system , we present results starting with the highest redshift system and ending with the lowest .",

    "the whole situation is suggestive of a group of galaxies with lines of sight at large impact parameter through the outskirts of the galaxies .",
    "this could be a hint of the galaxy type and environment of the @xmath38 system , for which we have no direct information .    however , not all is the same between system a and the @xmath38 absorber .",
    "system a has very strong absorption , whereas our system has so little that an abundance pattern adjustment is required to account for its deficiency . while there have been many papers which discuss strong nitrogen underabundances in dlas , many of those focus on systems with metallicites lower than our system ( @xmath188 compared to our @xmath182 @xcite ) .",
    "our system is apparently different from such dlas and from dwarf galaxies , which are also nitrogen deficient , but have low metallicity as well @xcite .",
    "this may suggest an enrichment scenario which is only primary , however coverage of oxygen transitions would be required to be able to determine this .",
    "a more interesting ( though speculative ) hypothesis is that our @xmath38 system and system a of @xcite represent the absorption features of the tidal tails and debris from interacting galaxies .",
    "due to multiple interactions in a group , material may be dispersed , with some regions collapsing to form star clusters , tidal dwarf galaxies and other gaseous concentrations .",
    "should our line of sight pass through such a region , pockets of higher density would be randomly crossed , giving absorption profiles with many smaller features , but no main feature . such a circumstance was suggested by the group environment known for the pg  @xmath16 absorbers @xcite , but in our case , there is much less supporting evidence .",
    "unless the line of sight fell along one of the tails , multiple interactions would be needed to produce the structures with a large spread in velocity . without an image",
    "deep enough to resolve the galaxy / galaxies associated with this absorber , we can not test this speculation .",
    "there is also a small amount of absorption observed for the @xmath189 cloud , which our models can not account for .",
    "this absorption can not be produced in the same phase as the , and can only be explained by an additional , very - low ionization phase at the same velocity .",

    "because of these extreme properties and because the determination of the lack of lyman limit break from the fos data was so uncertain , we consider an alternative model with @xmath247 .",

    "this system has many of the same properties as the @xmath222 system toward cso  @xmath248 presented by @xcite .",

    "the very - low ionization transitions , , , , and , also show some kinematic structure .",
    "therefore , we use the voigt profile fit to the  2853 , clouds @xmath90@xmath115 , as a starting point for the photoionization models . a very - low ionization phase , with @xmath262 , can be used to fit the and in cloud @xmath149 at @xmath263  , but it underproduces and . to adequately fit",

    "figure  [ fig057 ] shows the contribution of the very - low ionization phase ( clouds @xmath90@xmath115 ) to the , , and as a dotted line , showing the need for a low ionization phase .",
    "the low ionization phase was able to be constrained by the required production of the saturated transitions , but more importantly by the two 0.1emiii transitions . for simplicity",
    ", we assumed three components ( clouds @xmath90@xmath115 ) centered on the three very - low ionization phase components , and found a plausible fit to the  1527 profile with the minimum values of the column densities .",

    "the profile resulted in overproducing to a greater degree than was underproduced by the very - low phase , prompting us to vary the abundance of iron in that phase .",
    "because of saturation effects , specific values of constraints should be viewed with caution . for example , if the  1527 column densities were larger , then @xmath68 would be constrained to be higher .",
    "also , the model fits to the  1671 and mg0.1emii  @xmath6 are not consistent with the data , suggesting additional abundance parameter adjustments and/or a more complex phase structure . it may be possible to resolve this by adjusting the silicon abundance in the low ionization phase , however .",
    "nonetheless , the essential conclusion concerning the low ionization phase is that most of the absorption can not be produced by these same clouds .",
    "this is not true for regions of velocity coinciding with @xmath263 and @xmath269   clouds ( @xmath149 and @xmath115 ) : these can be adequately fit by the low ionization phase ; when the ionization parameter is constrained by and 0.1emiii , the is also consistently produced .",

    "we found that the metallicity in the very - low ionization phase was constrained to be @xmath272 , with a best fit at @xmath273 , which arises from the slight variations in absorption strengths between transitions caused by varying metallicity .",
    "this effect happens in the optically thick regime .",
    "due to the narrow range of the velocity distribution of the low ionization gas , we were unable to model the profile as multiple individual components , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "it seems more likely that the is dominated by a single cloud , or by a few clouds very close together in velocity space .",
    "a higher ionization phase is needed to produce the absorption in this system , for the main reason that the c0.1emiv  @xmath108 profiles have absorption lying at both higher and lower velocities than the low ionization profiles . since is the only high ionization transition covered , the only constraint on its ionization parameter is the non - detection of low ionization transitions at some velocities .",

    "these absorbers are about two - thirds as common as strong absorbers @xcite .",
