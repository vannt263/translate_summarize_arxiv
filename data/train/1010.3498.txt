    "giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) are main sites of star formation .",
    "there are approximately three thousand gmcs in our galaxy , with a size of 10 - 80 pc and a mass of 10@xmath11 - 5 @xmath3 10@xmath12 m@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "while only low - mass stars form in dark clouds @xcite , in gmcs both low - mass and high - mass stars form @xcite .",
    "there are many uncertain aspects of star formation in gmcs , such as the core mass function ( cmf ) , its link to the initial mass function ( imf ) , massive star formation , and cluster formation .",
    "hence , studies of star formation in gmcs are imperative to the comprehensive understanding of star formation .",
    "theoretical studies of massive star formation and cluster formation have proposed that external effects on molecular clouds , such as ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation from hii regions , supernova remnants ( snrs ) , molecular outflows , and cloud - cloud collisions are required to trigger the massive - star @xcite and cluster formation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is proposed that the shape of the cmf could also be affected by the presence of those external effects @xcite .",
    "hence , it is essential to unveil the global picture of those external effects on molecular gas in gmcs .",
    "it is , however , not yet clear how ubiquitous those external effects and the triggered star formation in gmcs are .",
    "unbiased and extensive mapping observations of gmcs in molecular and dust continuum emission , covering an entire gmc and resolving individual cores with a typical size of @xmath5 0.1 pc , and the comparison with the images at other wavelengths , are required to approach the global picture of star formation in gmcs .",
    "the orion - a gmc , with an extent of @xmath5 @xmath14 ( corresponding to @xmath5 72 pc ) in the southern part of orion constellation , is the nearest ( @xmath15= 400 pc ; @xcite ) gmc and one of the well studied regions in star formation studies @xcite .",
    "many authors have proposed that the orion - a gmc is externally affected , both at small ( @xmath5 0.1 pc ) and large scales ( @xmath5 several @xmath3 10 pc ) , by molecular outflow , ionizing radiation , snrs , and stellar winds generated by the orion ob association , from its morphological structure , velocity structure , and the stellar ages @xcite .",
    "ob stars embedded in the orion - a gmc form the hii region , m 42 , 43 , and ngc 1977 @xcite .",
    "molecular outflows driven from omc-2/fir 3 and fir 6c interact with the surrounding dense cores , which triggers gravitational instabilities in the dense cores and the next generation star formation @xcite .",
    "these facts imply that the orion - a gmc is one of the most suitable gmcs for an unbiased extensive study of triggered star formation .    with the advent of multi - beam receivers at millimeter wavelengths , wide - field mapping observations over several square degrees at an angular resolution of several @xmath3 10@xmath7",
    "are now feasible . in this paper",
    ", we present a wide , sensitive 1.1-mm dust - continuum and @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 ) line imaging of the northern part of the orion a gmc with the aztec camera mounted on the aste telescope and bears mounted on the nobeyama ( nro ) 45-m telescope , respectively .",
    "the aim of this paper is to reveal the overall structure of the orion - a gmc from a cloud ( @xmath16 10 pc ) to a core scale ( @xmath17 0.1 pc ) with the wide coverage and high sensitivity , and specifically , to unveil the global picture of the external triggers of star formation in the gmc from the comparison with the near - infrared ( nir ) and mid - infrared ( mir ) images .",
    "the detailed physical processes of individual triggered star formation will be discussed in the forthcoming papers .",
    "the 1.1 mm dust - continuum emission is optically thin and traces the total mass of molecular gas in cores and envelopes @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 ) emission traces low - density gas ( @xmath17 10@xmath18 @xmath19 ) and is usually optically thick and easily thermalized .",
    "hence , the @xmath0co emission traces global structures of gmcs , and the peak intensities of the @xmath0co emission at the emission ridge often reflect kinetic temperature of molecular gas .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the nro 45-m and aztec / aste observations are described . in section 3 , we present results of the aztec 1.1 mm continuum and the nro @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 ) mapping of the orion - a gmc . in section 4",
    ", we focus on the possible external triggers of the star formation in the orion - a gmc .",
    "first , we describe the possibility that the entire orion - a gmc is influenced over @xmath5 several @xmath3 10 pc scale by the external effect .",
    "then , we show the region irradiated by the uv radiation from ob stars embedded in the orion - a gmc over a few pc - scale . in section 5 , we summarize this paper .",
    "from october to december 2008 , we carried out 1.1 mm dust - continuum observations toward the @xmath20 @xmath3 @xmath21 region in the northern part of the orion a molecular cloud with the aztec camera @xcite equipped in the aste 10 m telescope @xcite located at pampa la bola ( altitude = 4800 m ) , chile",
    ". the weather conditions during our observing period were moderate and the typical opacity at 225 ghz was in the range of 0.1 - 0.2 .",
    "the aztec camera mounted on the aste telescope is an 144-element bolometric camera tuned to operate in the 1.1 mm atmospheric window , and provides an angular resolution of 28@xmath7 in full width at half maximum ( fwhm)@xcite .",
    "observations were performed in the raster scan mode toward a pair of 100@xmath22 @xmath3 100@xmath22 fields , centered on ( @xmath23,@xmath24)=(@xmath25 ) and ( @xmath26 ) . each field",
    "was observed several times with azimuth and elevation scans .",
    "the separation among scans was adopted to be 117@xmath7 , which is a quarter of the aztec field of view ( fov;@xmath5 @xmath27 ) .",
    "a scanning speed of the telescope was 250@xmath7 sec@xmath6 . totally 30 individual maps in the entire field with an integration time of 26 minutes were taken , and those maps were averaged to produce the final map with the total integration time of 26 minutes @xmath3 30 maps = 13 hours .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked every 2 hours by observing a quasar 0539 - 057 over a 4 @xmath3 4 arcmin@xmath28 region .",
    "the derived pointing offsets were linearly interpolated along the time sequence and the interpolated pointing offset was applied to each target map .",
    "the pointing uncertainty of the aztec map is estimated to be better than 2@xmath7 .",
    "we observed uranus as a flux calibrator twice per night . by observing uranus with each aztec detector element",
    ", we measured the flux conversion factor ( fcf ) from the optical loading value ( in watts ) to the source flux ( in jy beam@xmath6 ) for each detector element . the principal component analysis ( pca , @xcite ) cleaning method",
    "was applied to remove the atmospheric noise .",
    "details of the flux calibration are described by @xcite and @xcite . since the pca method does not have sensitivity to extended sources",
    ", we apply the iterative mapping method ( fruit , @xcite ) to recover the extended components .",

    "we describe the performance of fruit in appendix 1 .      from december 2007 to may 2008 , we carried out @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 ; 115.271204 ghz ) line observations toward the @xmath29 @xmath3 @xmath30 region in the northern part of the orion a molecular cloud with the 25-element focal plane receiver bears equipped in the 45 m telescope at nro . at 115 ghz",

    ", we used 25 sets of 1024 channel auto - correlators ( acs ) which have the bandwidth of 32 mhz and the frequency resolution of 37.8 khz @xcite .",
    "the frequency resolution corresponds to the velocity resolution of @xmath5 0.1 km s@xmath6 at 115 ghz . during the observations , the system noise temperatures were in the range between 250 and 500 k in a double sideband .",
    "the standard chopper wheel method @xcite was used to convert the output signal into the antenna temperature @xmath32 ( k ) , corrected for the atmospheric attenuation .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked every 1.5 hours by observing a sio maser source , ori - kl , and was better than 3@xmath7 during the whole observing period . to correct the gain variation among the 25 beams of the bears",
    ", we used calibration data obtained from the observations toward orion irc 2 using another sis receiver , s100 , with a single sideband ( ssb ) filter and acousto - optical spectrometers ( aoss ) as a back end .",

    "previous observations of the northern part of the orion a molecular cloud in dust - continuum emissions at 850 @xmath10 m @xcite , 1.2 mm @xcite , and 1.3 mm @xcite have revealed an `` integral - shape '' filamentary feature from the south to the north of ori - kl ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 = @xmath36 ) , where the northern end , region surrounding ori - kl , and the southern region of ori - kl in the integral - shape filament are called omc-2/3 , omc-1 , and omc-4 , respectively .",
    "the global feature seen in our 1.1 mm dust - continuum map is consistent with that found in the previous observations , that is , the integral - shape filament along the north - south direction ( named as `` integral - shape filament '' in figure [ aztec2 ] ) . the central orion - kl region has been masked out , because around the ori - kl region the continuum emission is too bright to be reconstructed as an accurate structure with the aztec observing and data - reduction technique ( see appendix 1 ) .",
    "our mapping area extends @xmath5 @xmath37 along the eastern and the western directions centered on the integral - shape filament , and is wider than that of the previous observations . as a result ,",

    "our high - sensitivity ( @xmath5 9 mjy ) 1.1 mm continuum observations have revealed the presence of another filamentary structure ( named as `` new filament '' in figure [ aztec2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , a continuum feature extending almost perpendicular to the integral - shape filament centered on mms 9 ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 = @xmath38 ) was detected clearly at a signal to noise ratio of @xmath16 50 @xmath35 , although this feature was not clearly seen in the previous studies ( named as `` east - west extension '' in figure [ aztec2 ] ) . in the most eastern side of this structure , a cavity - like structure with a size of 0.4 pc was found at a central position of @xmath23 , @xmath24 = @xmath39 ( named as `` cavity - shape '' in figure [ aztec2 ] ) .",
    "the distribution of the 1.1 mm dust - continuum emission around the hii region , m 43 , which is excited by a b0.5 star , nu ori ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 = @xmath40 ) @xcite , shows a shell - like structure with a size of @xmath5 0.5 pc ( named as `` shell '' in figure [ aztec2 ] ) . toward the south of m 42 ( omc-4 region )",

    "this filament is known as one of photo - dominated regions ( pdrs ) from the cn line observations @xcite and is named as `` dark lane south filament '' ( dlsf , named as `` dlsf '' in figure [ aztec2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , toward the opposite side of dlsf with respect to the integral - shape filament there is another filamentary structure with a size of @xmath5 3 pc , which is bending at the middle ( named as `` bending structure '' in figure [ aztec2 ] ) .    in the southmost region",
    "where an active cluster - forming region of l 1641 n @xcite resides , four filamentary structures with a size of @xmath5 0.5 - 2.0 pc are seen aligned almost in parallel ( named as `` paralleled filament '' in figure [ aztec2 ] ) .",
    "figure [ co_alla ] and [ co_allb ] show the total integrated and the peak intensity maps of the @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 ) emission in the northern part of the orion a molecular cloud , respectively .",
    "the main feature seen in these maps is the same as that in the 1.1 mm continuum map , namely , integral - shape filament . at the eastern edge of the integral - shape filament",
    "there appears a sharp emission contrast while at the western edge the emission intensity decreases gradually .",
    "hereafter we call the sharp emission contrast at the eastern edge of the integral - shape filament `` co front '' ( see figure [ co_allc ] ) . in the total integrated intensity map the brightest point at the center corresponds to the location of ori - kl . toward the south - east of ori - kl",
    "there appears a bar - like feature with a length of @xmath5 0.6 pc , which is more evident in the peak intensity map .",

    "similarly to co front , there is a sharp emission contrast at the western side of dlsf .",
    "in addition to these filamentary features , a @xmath0co emission extending to the east from orion - kl and a diffuse co emission at the west of the integral - shape filament are seen .",

    "the central velocity of dlsf ( @xmath5 7 km s@xmath6 ) is also different from that of the integral - shape filament . hence , dlsf is likely to be kinematically distinct from the main cloud component . in the velocity range of 12 to 16 km",

    "figure [ co_allb ] shows the velocity dispersion map of the @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 ) emission . the velocity dispersion map shows the increase of the velocity dispersion toward the east of co front in the omc-2/3 region ( see figure [ co_allc ] ) .",

    "recent laboratory experiments have shown that pahs are produced on the dust grains irradiated by the fuv radiation @xcite .",
    "hence , presence of the strong 8 @xmath10 m emission suggests presence of the fuv radiation from hii regions .",
    "while the 1.1 mm and the @xmath0co images show the distribution of the molecular gas , the 2mass and the 8@xmath10 m images show three bright nebulae , m 42 , m 43 , and ngc 1977 .",

    "the 8 @xmath10 m , 1.1 mm , and the @xmath0co emissions show the systematic distributions along the direction to the hii region ; the 8 @xmath10 m emission distributes on the northern part of the 1.1 mm dust - continuum condensation , while the @xmath0co emission distributes on the southern part of the 1.1 mm dust - continuum condensation .",
    "one of the first findings in our extensive @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 ) emission observations of the northern part of the orion a molecular cloud is the presence of the diffuse co component over the entire eastern region of the integral - shape filament .",
    "figure [ diffuse ] highlights the total integrated intensity map of the diffuse co component with respect to the peak intensity map at the omc-2/3 region , and figure [ ra_pv ] shows position - velocity ( p - v ) diagrams whose cut lines are along the ra direction shown in figure [ diffuse ] . in the p - v diagrams ,",
    "the central velocity of the diffuse co component is 5 - 6 km s@xmath6 , while that of the main component is 11 - 12 km s@xmath6 .",
    "these two velocity components appear to be connected at co front , raising the @xmath0co velocity dispersion at co front .",
    "figure [ int ] shows peak intensity profiles whose cut lines are the same as that of the p - v diagrams in figure [ ra_pv ] .",
    "while the peak intensity of the diffuse co component is around 4 - 7 k at @xmath9 , that of the main cloud component exceeds 50 k , and hence there is an abrupt increase of the @xmath0co peak intensity at co front .",
    "in contrast , toward the western outskirts of the main cloud component the @xmath0co peak intensity decreases gradually ( see figure [ co_alla ] - [ co_allc ] ) .",
    "these peculiar features extend over the entire co front as can be seen in figures [ co_alla ] - [ co_channel ] , although toward the southern part of co front the difference of the central velocities becomes smaller .",
    "the reason why the velocity difference between the diffuse co component and the main cloud component becomes less clear is the large scale velocity gradient of the main cloud component ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "there are two possible interpretations on the origin of the diffuse co component ; one is the trail of the main cloud component moving away from the galactic plane and the other is the pre - existing surrounding diffuse gas swept up by neighboring external sources .",
    "@xcite has suggested these two possibilities on the origin of the diffuse co component in the east of the l 1641 n region .",
    "it is , however , difficult to explain the difference of the central velocity between the diffuse co component and the main cloud component and the abrupt increase of the @xmath0co peak intensity by the former interpretation .",
    "we consider that the `` l - shaped '' feature of the diffuse co component in the p - v diagrams and the abrupt increase of the @xmath0co peak intensity imply presence of the interaction between the diffuse co component and the main cloud component @xcite , and that the diffuse co component is being accumulated on to the surface of the main cloud component at co front .",
    "in fact , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have suggested that ori ob 1a and ori ob 1b , @xmath5 100 pc away from the orion a molecular cloud , affect the orion a molecular cloud and disturb the morphology and kinematics of the cloud , respectively .",
    "these ob stars are the possible sources to sweep up the pre - existing diffuse material toward the direction to the main cloud component .",
    "our observational results favor the proposal by @xcite , since ori ob 1b locates in the east of the orion a molecular cloud and the diffuse",
    "co component also distributes toward the same direction from the orion a molecular cloud .",
    "the collision of the diffuse co component with the main cloud component might trigger the next star formation in the cloud @xcite .      in the last section ,",
    "we suggest the possibility that the diffuse co component is swept up by ori ob 1b and interacts with the entire orion a molecular cloud . in this section",
    ", we focus on more local effects in a few pc - scale , namely , the hii regions embedded in the orion a molecular cloud . as well as the external sources away from the cloud , newly born ob stars embedded in the cloud can also influence on the structure , chemistry , thermal balance , and the star formation in the cloud @xcite .",
    "there are several ob stars ( such as @xmath47@xmath48 ori c and nu ori ) and hii regions in our mapping area of the orion a molecular cloud and these sources are likely to affect star formation in the orion a molecular cloud .",
    "as shown in  3.3 , we found that there are systematic differences of the distribution among the @xmath0co , 1.1 mm , and the 8 @xmath10 m emissions and that the 8 @xmath10 m , 1.1 mm , and the @xmath0co emissions are distributed as a function of the distance from the ob stars .",
    "the most clear example is in dlsf irradiated by @xmath47@xmath48 ori c , and the intensity profiles as a function of the distance from @xmath47@xmath48 ori c are shown in figure [ int_profile ] .",
    "the presence of the strong 8 @xmath10 m emission suggests the fuv radiation from the hii regions . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath0co molecules are dissociated by the fuv radiation , since the energy of fuv ( 6 ev - 13.6 ev ) is high enough to dissociate @xmath0co molecules with an dissociative energy of 11.4 ev .",
    "hence , the @xmath0co emission does not distribute at the near side of the exciting star .",
    "the 1.1 mm emission traces both the cold and warm dusts .",
    "hence , the systematic distributions of the 8 @xmath10 m , 1.1 mm , and the @xmath0co emissions can be explained by the pdr model @xcite .",
    "in fact , toward dlsf and m 43 , where the systematic distributions of the @xmath0co , 1.1 mm , and the 8 @xmath10 m emissions are seen , the observations of the cn line , one of the excellent tracers for pdr , suggest the presence of pdr .",
    "region a - d , relatively isolated dusty condensations , also exhibit the systematic distributions of the @xmath0co , 1.1 mm , and the 8 @xmath10 m emissions along the direction to the exciting sources .",
    "these isolated condensations are likely to be pre - existing molecular cloud cores .",
    "when an expanding hii region interacts with a pre - existing molecular cloud core , the strong uv radiation will compress the core .",
    "this compression could induce the gravitational collapse of the core @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that the dusty condensations of region a - d are affected by the uv radiation from the ob stars .",
    "moreover , the dusty condensation of region b is associated with the spitzer 24 @xmath10 m sources , suggesting the presence of the star formation .",
    "we have carried out extensive mapping observations of the northern part of the orion a molecular cloud in the 1.1 mm dust - continuum emission with the aztec camera equipped in the aste telescope and in the @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 ) emission with the bears receiver equipped in the nro 45 m telescope .",
    "the main results of our wide - field ( @xmath53 ) and high - sensitivity ( @xmath5 9 mjy beam@xmath6 ) observations are summarized as follows ;    1 .    we have found new features of the 1.1 mm dust - continuum emission in addition to the previously known integral - shape filament . in the omc-2/3 region , a new dusty filamentary structure is detected toward the east of the integral - shape filament .",
    "a dusty shell - like structure around the hii region , m 43 , and a filamentary structure associated with dlsf are detected . in the southmost region where an active cluster - forming region of l",
    "1641 n is located , four filamentary structures with a size of @xmath5 0.5 - 2.0 pc are seen aligned almost in parallel . 2 .    in the @xmath0co ( @xmath1=10 )",
    "line observations , we found diffuse co component over the entire eastern region of the integral - shape filament .",
    "the peak intensity profiles from the diffuse co component to the integrals - shape filament show an abrupt increase at the border line ( co front ) and the p - v diagrams show the sudden velocity change from 5 - 6 km s@xmath6 to 11- 12 km s@xmath6 .",
    "we suggest that these peculiar features of the diffuse co component show that the diffuse material swept up by orion ob 1b , @xmath5100 pc away from the orion a molecular cloud , is being accumulated onto the surface of the integral - shape filament .",
    "comparisons among the @xmath0co , 1.1 mm , and the 8 @xmath10 m emission distribution in m 43 , dlsf , and region a - d have revealed that the 8 @xmath10 m , 1.1 mm , and the @xmath0co emissions are located sequentially as a function of the distance from the neighboring ob stars .",
    "these results suggest the presence of the pdrs around m 43 , dlsf , and region a - d , excited by the nu ori , @xmath47@xmath48 ori c , and @xmath47@xmath48 ori c , respectively .",
    "in particular , the dusty condensation of region b is associated with a spitzer 24 @xmath10 m source , suggesting the presence of the star formation .",
    "region a - d are possible site of star formation triggered by the pdrs .",

    "in this appendix , we present our imaging simulation with artifact gaussian sources as input models , in order to test the performance of the aztec data reduction .      the aztec data set is reduced by using the available aztec data reduction pipeline written in idl and developed by the university of massachusetts according to guidelines in @xcite .",
    "this pipeline includes the despiking , atmosphere removal , and optimal filtering .",
    "the despiking which is removal of the cosmic ray is , however , not applied to orion data reduction to avoid the removal of source emission , since the emission in the orion region is too strong .",
    "principal components analysis ( pca ) cleaning method is applied for removal of the atmospheric noise in this pipeline .",
    "finally , the 30 individual maps were coadded .",
    "this data reduction pipeline has , however , been optimized for the identification of point sources .",
    "the pca cleaning removes the astronomical signals in the case that the emission has an extended structure , since the signals which are a good correlation among each element are regarded as the atmospheric components and are removed .",
    "hence , the flux and size of the extended sources are underestimated . in order to recover the extended features in the orion map which is subtracted by the pca cleaning",
