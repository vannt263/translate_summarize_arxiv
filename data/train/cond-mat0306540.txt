    "in previous two papers @xcite , @xcite we defined and analyzed random processes with continuous time parameter describing the evolution of special trees consisting of _ living and dead nodes _ connected by _ lines_. it seems to be appropriate to repeat briefly the characteristic features of the evolution process .",
    "the initial state @xmath3 of the tree corresponds to a single living node called _ root _ which at the end of its life is capable of producing @xmath4 new living nodes , and after that it becomes immediately dead .",
    "if @xmath5 then the new nodes are promptly connected to the dead node and each of them _ independently of the others _ can evolve further like a root .",
    "the random evolution of trees with continuous time parameter has not been investigated intensively recently .",
    "the main interest since the late 1990s has been focussed on the study of non - equilibrium networks @xcite occurring in common real world . the evolution mechanism of trees with living and dead nodes may be useful in some of biological systems where the branching processes are dominant .    in what follows , we will use notations applied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it seems to be useful to cite the basic definitions .",
    "the probability to find the number @xmath0 of living nodes produced by one dying precursor equal to @xmath6 was denoted by @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "is the set of non - negative integers . ] for the generating function as well as the expectation value and the variance of @xmath0 we used the following notations : @xmath9 where @xmath10_{z=1 } , \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; j = 1 , 2 , \\ldots\\ ] ] are _ factorial moments _ of @xmath0 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the time dependence of the random evolution is determined almost completely by the expectation value @xmath11 . in accordance to this",
    "the evolution was called subcritical if @xmath12 , critical if @xmath13 and supercritical if @xmath14 .    in the further considerations we are going to use four distributions for the random variable @xmath0 . as shown in @xcite the equations derived for the first and the second moments of the number of nodes are _ independent of the detailed structure of the distribution of @xmath0 _ provided that the moments @xmath11 and @xmath15 are finite .",
    "we called distributions of this type for @xmath0 _ arbitrary _ and used the symbol @xmath16 for its notation . in many cases it seems to be enough to apply the truncated distribution of @xmath0 .",
    "if the possible values of the random variable @xmath0 are @xmath17 and @xmath18 with probabilities @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , then in the previous paper @xcite the distributions of this type were denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "many times it is expedient to assume distributions to be completely determined by one parameter . as known the geometric and poisson distributions are such distributions . in paper",
    "@xcite we used the symbols @xmath22 and @xmath23 to identify these distributions .",
    "the distribution function of the lifetime @xmath24 of a living node will be supposed to be exponential , i.e. @xmath25 . in order to characterize the tree evolution two non - negative integer valued random functions @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    "are introduced : @xmath26 is the number of living nodes , while @xmath27 is that of dead nodes at @xmath28 .",
    "the total number of nodes at @xmath29 is denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "clearly , the nodes can be sorted into groups according to _ the number of outgoing lines_. following the notation in @xcite the number of nodes with @xmath31 outgoing lines at time instant @xmath29 is denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "a node not having outgoing line is called _ end - node_. it is obvious that an end - node is either live or dead .",
    "therefore , the number of end - nodes @xmath33 can be written as a sum of numbers of living and dead end - nodes , i.e. @xmath34 . since all living nodes are end - nodes @xmath35 can be replaced by @xmath26 .",
    "the total number of dead nodes @xmath27 is given by @xmath36 .",
    "in this paper we are dealing with properties of @xmath37 and @xmath38 when @xmath39 .",
    "we will call the random trees arising from a single root after elapsing infinite time _",
    "stationary_.    in section @xmath18 the basic properties of probability distributions of the number of nodes , living and end - nodes are investigated when @xmath39 .",
    "special attention is paid in section @xmath40 to the effect of distribution law of the number of outgoing lines .",
    "three different distributions of @xmath0 are investigated . in order to simplify the notation ,",
    "indices referring to different distributions of @xmath0 are usually omitted in formulas .",
    "finally , the characteristic properties of stationary random trees are summarized in section @xmath41 .",
    "let us introduce the notion of _ tree size _ which is nothing else but the total number of nodes @xmath30 at time moment @xmath28 .",
    "we want to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the tree size , i.e. the behavior of the random function @xmath30 when @xmath42 .",
    "we say the _ limit random variable _",
    "@xmath43 exists in the sense that the relation : @xmath44 is true for all positive integers @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the initial state of the tree .",
    "a randomly evolving tree is called _",
    "`` very old '' _ when @xmath45 , and a very old tree , as mentioned already , will be named _",

    "it seems to be important to investigate _ how the living nodes behave _ in very old , i.e. stationary trees .",
    "intuitively one can say that stationary trees arising in subcritical evolution do not contain living nodes and they have finite average size . at the same time",
    ", it seems to be quite obvious that stationary trees originating in supercritical evolution could have living nodes with non - zero probability , i.e. they are entities of _ `` eternal life''_.    in order to give more precise answer the generating function of the random variable @xmath89 should be derived .",

    "if @xmath51 , then besides @xmath95 equation ( [ 6 ] ) has another fixed point given by @xmath96 $ ] , hence the probability @xmath97 should be larger than zero .",
    "in other words , a supercritical stationary tree may evolve infinitely with certain non - zero probability .   of subcritical stationary trees",
