    "over the last few decades there is a growing interest in radiative heat - waves , specifically for high energy density physics ( hedp ) experiments  @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "a source of x - ray heats the boundary of a target , and a radiative heat wave propagates through the target s material . if the problem contains more than a few mean free paths , local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) and diffusion approximation can be assumed . when the heat - wave propagation is faster than the speed of sound ( supersonic case ) , it is described using only the radiative transfer equation  @xcite .",
    "when the heat front propagates slower than the speed of sound ( subsonic case ) , hydrodynamic motion of the matter becomes important .",
    "the high pressure of the heated matter causes ablation behind the heat front , thus the density is low near the rear boundary , and high near the ablation front .",
    "this ablation pressure generates a strong shock wave which propagates from the heat front forward .",
    "we call the former region  ablation region \" and the latter  shock region \" .",
    "subsonic heat waves are important in modeling inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) indirect - drive experiments  @xcite , specifically in the interior of the high - z optically thick hohlraum walls .",
    "the heat wave problem was first stated by marshak  @xcite , who proposed self - similar solutions for the supersonic case .",
    "subsonic case solutions were investigated by many authors  @xcite .",
    "most of the solutions focused on the ablation region alone , since the full problem ( including the shock region ) is not self - similar for the general case .",
    "early simple approximations offered taking a constant ablation pressure in the shock regime  @xcite .",
    "however , these approximations may yield large errors , especially if the yielding ablation pressure is far from being constant , such as the case of constant temperature boundary condition .",
    "recently , shussman and heizler proposed a semi - analytic model to describe both ablation and shock regions  @xcite . the solution is composed of two different self - similar solutions , one for each region .",
    "the two solutions are patched together at the heat front .",
    "the model was compared to full numerical simulations ( which used the same single ideal gas eos ) of subsonic radiative heat wave in au , and found to fit the simulations to within @xmath0 in the heat region and @xmath1 in the shock region .    however , the semi - analytic model ( and the simulations ) used the same eos for both the ablation and shock regions . using a single ideal - gas for the eos ( which is fitted for the ablation regime as in  @xcite ) may cause large errors when describing the shock region , since the temperatures and densities vary widely between the ablation region and the shock region",
    ". this can be shown by comparing the semi - analytic solution to a numerical simulation with an eos tables .    in this work",
    ", we propose a correction for the semi - analytic model to well describe the shock region .",
    "we use the fact that the solution is composed of two self - similar solutions , and therefore there is no need to use only one eos for both solutions . in order to conserve the self - similar nature of each solution",
    ", we assume ideal gas eos , but choose a different ideal gas parameter @xmath2 for each region .",
    "this method is therefore equivalent to using a binary - eos with piecewise temperature dependency .",
    "we examine this differentiation caused by using the binary - eos to an exact sesame table  @xcite .",

    "we present the results of simulations using a single eos , compared to using a sesame table eos , and show that large errors are obtained by using a single eos for both regions .",
    "thus , we stress the importance of using a different eos for each region . in sec .",

    "[ discussion ] .",
    "in the section we briefly repeat the methodology of obtaining and patching two self - similar solutions in order to describe the whole solution ( for details see  @xcite ) .",
    "the ablation region is solved using a time - dependent temperature boundary condition , in a manner similar to  @xcite , and the shock region is solved using a time - dependent pressure boundary condition .",

    "these results emphasize the importance of using a correct eos in each physical ( temperature and density ) regime of the problem .",

    "in the @xmath78ev regime , the eos can fits reasonably to ideal gas with a single @xmath79 . on the other hand ,",
    "the eos for shock region temperatures ( @xmath80 , highly dependent on the boundary conditions in the ablation region ) , varies significantly .",
    "thus , restricted to a single @xmath66-value of the eos in shock regime , @xmath58 , one must fit the value for a narrow thermodynamic range of the eos .",
    "the specific boundary condition sets the temperature criterion , which sets the relevant temperature range of the eos .    for the case of boundary condition with @xmath47ev ,",
    "the temperature in the shock region is about @xmath81ev . for these temperatures ,",
    "the best fit value of the eos to an ideal gas is @xmath82 ( with a large variance of@xmath83 , due to the highly - dependency of the eos in the shock regime , that may cause errors in describing the full physical behavior ) .",
    "thus , we shall use the self - similar model with @xmath79 in the ablation region and @xmath82 in the shock region .",

    "both the model and the binary-@xmath66 calculation reproduce the table results to within @xmath86 .",
    "the lower agreement is because the density is most sensitive to the numerical value of the parameter in ideal gas eos .",
    "thus , the binary-@xmath66 model predicts the solution of the shock region much better than a single eos model ( see again fig .",
    "[ motiv1 ] ) . the temperature profile for the same boundary condition",
    "are presented in fig .",
    "[ temp](a ) . in the ablation region , the agreement is within @xmath0 , while in the shock region , the agreement is within @xmath86 , which is of course similar to the agreement of the density profile .    for higher ablation temperatures , higher",

    "for example , in the temperature regime of nif experiments  @xcite ( @xmath87ev ) the expected shock temperature is of about @xmath88ev . for these higher temperatures , sesame tables ( and eos in general )",
    "fit much better to ideal gas eos because the high internal energy is larger compared to solid lattice interactions .",
    "we therefore expect the binary-@xmath66 model to better predict the full simulation results in higher temperatures .",
    "a best fit of the eos for temperatures of @xmath88ev , yields @xmath89 , and thus the appropriate eos to be used in the binary-@xmath66 simulation is : @xmath90    in figs .",

    ", we can see the binary-@xmath66 simulation fit the sesame table simulation better for the higher temperature ( within @xmath92 for the density profile ) .",
    "it is important to note that because the temperatures and densities of the shock region change with time , also the best fit value of @xmath58 changes .",
    "therefore , comparing the hydrodynamic profiles obtained by the model at a single time @xmath46nsec is not enough . for testing our model as a function of the time , in fig .",
    "[ shock_front ] we present the shock front @xmath71 as a function of time for different @xmath38 .",
    "it can be seen that the self - similar model yields the correct time dependency of the shock front position for all the times . in @xmath47ev ,",
    "the maximal deviation is about @xmath92 , while in @xmath93ev , the maximal deviation is lower ( about @xmath68 ) , as expected and explained before .",
    "comparing these values of errors to the single @xmath66 value ( fig .",
    "[ motiv2 ] ) of factor of 2 in the shock front , emphasis the use of binary-@xmath66 self - similar solutions .",
    "in this work , we used the fact that the semi - analytic solution of  @xcite is composed of two separate self - similar solutions , each one valid in a different region of the physical problem , in order to use a different eos for each region while maintaining the self - similarity of the problem .",
    "this model was tested for au thin foils .",
    "we showed that using the naive approximation that the eos is the same in both regions of a single @xmath66-value of eos causes large errors in describing the shock region ( compared to a similar calculation with a sesame table ) , both in the hydrodynamic profiles and in and the shock position . using a binary-@xmath66 eos where the value @xmath58 in the shock region is best fit to sesame table , yields a much better prediction of the physical solution of the shock region .",
    "we checked the model for several temperatures , all in the relevant range of hedp experiments , and found that the model is applicable for designing , analyzing and understanding most hedp experiments .",
    "the model is especially useful for understanding and designing experiments in which the shock is important , such as eos experiments or subsonic heat wave experiments .",
