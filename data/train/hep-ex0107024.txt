    "in the last years there has been a revival of interest in the lowest - lying scalar mesons with masses below 1 gev which has motivated the experimental effort going on with the kloe detector@xcite at da@xmath0ne@xcite the frascati @xmath1-factory , where these resonances can be studied in detail in @xmath1 radiative decays .",
    "the 1 gev region is an interesting and challenging domain : on one side it is far below the perturbative qcd regime , on the other side strict chiral perturbation theory is not expected to make reliable predictions at these energy values where resonance effects can show up .",
    "this region has thus become an important test ground both for analyses based both on qcd sum - rules@xcite and for effective chiral models@xcite .",
    "the controversial nature of the @xmath3(980 ) , @xmath5(980)@xcite and the poor knowledge of their properties adds further interest to this 1 gev energy region : along the years several proposal have been suggested concerning the constitution of these scalars as complex qqqq states@xcite , kk molecules@xcite or ordinary qq mesons@xcite . a precise measurement of br(@xmath23 ) , br(@xmath13 ) and of the ratio of these branching ratios can help in better establishing the nature of these mesons@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe the preliminary results on the decays @xmath23 , @xmath245@xmath4 from the analysis of 17 pb@xmath2 , corresponding to about 50 millions of @xmath1 decays , from the data sample collected by kloe in the year 2000 .",
    "a peculiar aspect of these decays is that both the branching ratio and the resonance mass shape depend strongly on the meson structure .",
    "therefore , the analysis follows a scheme independent as much as possible on the model implemented in the montecarlo .",
    "the events are characterized by the presence of five prompt photons , i.e. photons coming from the interaction point ( i.p . ) of da@xmath0ne .",
    "these photons are detected as energy deposits in the calorimeter that satisfy the condition @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the arrival time , @xmath27 is the distance of the cluster from the i.p . and @xmath28 is the speed of light .",
    "we define a photon to be `` prompt '' if @xmath29@xcite .",
    "an acceptance angular region corresponding to the polar angle interval 21@xmath30159@xmath31 is defined for the prompt photons , in order to exclude the blind region around the beam - pipe .",
    "the processes that mainly contribute to the five photon final state are the following :    * @xmath32 * @xmath33 * @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) * @xmath36 ( @xmath35 )    and the non resonant ones :    * e@xmath37e@xmath38 * e@xmath37e@xmath39 ( @xmath35 )    also the three and seven photon final states    * @xmath40 * @xmath41 * e@xmath37e@xmath42 * @xmath43    have to be taken into account , because they can simulate five photon events due to machine background and cluster splitting or merging of close photons and loss of soft photons .",
    "the analyses described in this paper make use of a constrained fit ensuring kinematic closure of the events .",
    "the free parameters of the fit are : the three coordinates ( x , y , z ) of the impact point on the calorimeter , the energy and the time of flight for each photon coming from the i.p . , the two energies of the beams and the three coordinates of the position of the i.p .. the analysis procedure adopted is the following :    1 .   fully neutral events with exactly five prompt photons are selected ; 2 .",
    "the kinematic fit is applied on these events a first time with the constraints of the total energy and momentum conservation and satisfying @xmath25 for each prompt photon ; 3 .",
    "the photon pairing is performed looking for the best combination , by minimizing the appropriate @xmath44 for each of the following hypotheses : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the kinematic fit is applied again to each of the best combination constraining also the invariant masses of the photon pairs assigned to @xmath50 and @xmath51 , without any assumption on the @xmath3 and @xmath5 mass .",
    "the main background channels , with the expected signal to background ( s / b ) ratio obtained from @xcite , are listed in tab .  [",
    "tab : eff_fon ] . after applying the first kinematic fit ,",
    "the best photon combination producing the two @xmath53 pairs with @xmath50 mass is searched for with the additional condition @xmath54 mev ( the expected @xmath3 mass region ) . according to our simulation ,",
    "this procedure correctly assigns photons in 95% of the cases .",
    "the analysis cuts to select @xmath32 events are :    1 .   @xmath55 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath56 cut on the reconstructed @xmath50 s mass ( the output of the first kinematic fit , without mass constraints , is used ) ; 3 .",
    "@xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the angle between the primary photon and the pion s flight direction in the @xmath59 rest frame .",
    "this cut is performed to reduce the @xmath60 and @xmath61 backgrounds ; 4 .",
    "@xmath62 and a @xmath63 cut on the reconstructed @xmath64 mass to veto @xmath65 ; 5 .",
    "@xmath66 mev and @xmath67 for the two most energetic photons to reject @xmath68 ; 6 .",
    "@xmath63 cut on the radiative photon energy ( @xmath69 mev ) to reject @xmath70 .",
    "in order to evaluate the analysis efficiency as a function of @xmath71 , the generated @xmath3 mass has been divided into 20 mev bins .",
    "the total variation of the efficiency does not exceed @xmath72 of the mean value , which is reported in tab .",
    "[ tab : eff_fon ] together with the efficiencies for the background channels .",
    ".s / b ratios and analysis efficiencies for the @xmath32 decay and related background . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     c ( c ) +   +    since the @xmath33 events populate the same region of the scatter plot of fig.[psi ] as the signal , this contamination should be reduced by using different variables .",
    "the choosen ones are shown in the scatter plot of fig.[elliptic ] : the difference between the @xmath44 of the second fit in the hypotheses @xmath45 and @xmath46 and the reconstructed @xmath51 mass . the accepted region is defined by @xmath733 plus the internal part of the ellipse .",
    "last contamination that has to be reduced is @xmath43 . in fig.[erad].a",
    "is reported the invariant mass of the two photons associated to the @xmath51 ; the comparison with the mc shows that the background events mainly populate the tails of the distribution . a two standard deviation cut",
    "is then applied to reduce the @xmath74 contamination .",
    "the final efficiencies are reported in tab.[rates ] .    at the end of the selection procedure",
    "666 events survive .",
    "the expected number of background events is 253@xmath711 mainly due to @xmath33 and @xmath43 .",
    "the invariant mass of @xmath75 is shown in fig.[a0spectrum ] , together with the cos@xmath76 distribution for the non associated photon .",
    "the corresponding branching ratio is : @xmath77 the systematic error is still under study ; according to preliminary evaluations it should not exceed 10% .",
    "this result is in agreement , within the errors , with the values published by the vepp-2 m experiments@xcite and with the kloe result of the analysis of the 1999 statistics@xcite .",
    "the branching ratio ( [ a0result ] ) includes the @xmath36 contribution .",
    "if the interference of this process with @xmath34 is negligible@xcite , one can subtract the @xmath78 contribution . to evaluate the number of expected @xmath78 events ,",
    "the average of the very recent measurements of the br(@xmath79 ) performed by the two vepp-2 m experiments@xcite has been used .",
    "this average value turns out to be br(@xmath79)=(3.0@xmath70.3)@xmath910@xmath80 ( which is different from the pdg value@xcite br(@xmath79)=(2.4@xmath70.9)@xmath910@xmath80 ) , from which follows an expected number of 86@xmath79 @xmath81 events .",
    "after the subtraction one obtains : @xmath82",
    "from the results described in the previous sections a preliminary estimate of the ratio of the two branching ratios can be obtained .",
    "assuming that @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the dominant decay modes of respectively @xmath3 and @xmath5 and using the values of eqs.([f0result ] ) and ( [ a0subtracted ] ) , one obtains ( with br(@xmath23)=3br(@xmath32 ) ) : @xmath83 in reasonable agreement with the prediction given in @xcite .",
    "events with five prompt photon have been selected from a sample of 17 pb@xmath2 of the data collected by kloe in 2000 , corresponding to about 50 millions of @xmath1 meson produced . from the analysis of the @xmath45 channel",
