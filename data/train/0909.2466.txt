    "many products in our daily life contain soft matters ( e.g. , polymeric liquids , colloidal dispersion , and liquid crystals ) .",
    "soft matters involve complex internal degrees of freedom , such as orientation of molecules , dispersed particles , and phase - separated structure , and they exhibit peculiar flow behaviors coupled to the micro - scale dynamics , e.g. , visco - elastic flow , shear thinning or thickening , and flow - induced phase transition .",
    "investigation of the complicated flow behaviors of soft matters are of great importance in various science and engineering fields , such as fluid mechanics , materials science , biological science , mechanical engineering , and chemical engineering .",
    "to predict the flow behaviors of soft matters by computer simulation is challenging from both an academic and a practical point of view .",
    "the difficulty in simulating soft - matter flows also is also due to the complicated couplings between the microscopic dynamics of internal degrees of freedom and macroscopic flow behaviors . in the present paper ,",
    "we demonstrate that multiscale modeling is a promising candidate for soft - matter simulations .",
    "we solve the complicated visco - elastic flow behaviors of polymer melt by using a multiscale hybrid simulation method .",
    "usually , when computer simulations of polymer melt flows are performed , either computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) or molecular dynamics ( md ) are employed . in the case of cfd , mechanical properties of fluids",
    "must be modeled mathematically in advance as a form of `` constitutive relationship '' to be used in simulations .",
    "cfd is thus valid only for the cases in which mechanical properties of fluids are not too complex .",
    "polymer melts , however , have very complicated mechanical properties in general . in the case of md simulation , in contrast , fluids consist of huge numbers of molecules of arbitrary shapes . in principle , md simulation is thus applicable for any flows of any complex fluids .",
    "however , the drawback here is that enormous computational time is required to resolve the dynamics of all the constituent molecules .",
    "hence , md simulation is not yet applicable to problems which concern large - scale motions far beyond molecular size , as is done in the present paper . in order to overcome the weaknesses of the individual methods ,",
    "we have developed a multi - scale simulation method that combines md and cfd .    in our hybrid simulation method ,",
    "the macroscopic flow behaviors are solved using a cfd scheme , but , instead of using any constitutive equations , a local stress is calculated by using a non - equilibrium md simulation associated with each lattice node of the cfd simulation . the basic idea of this type of hybrid simulation method",
    "was first proposed by e and engquist@xcite , where the heterogeneous multiscale method ( hmm ) is presented as a general methodology for the efficient numerical computation of problems with multiscale problems .",
    "the hmm has also been applied to the simulations of complex fluids.@xcite the equation - free multiscale computation proposed by kevrekidis _",
    "et al_. is also based on a similar idea and has been applied to various problems.@xcite de _ et al_. have developed a hybrid method , which is called scale bridging method in their paper , that can correctly reproduce the memory effect of a polymeric liquid and demonstrate the non - linear visco - elastic behaviors of polymeric liquid between oscillating plates.@xcite the methodology of the present hybrid simulation is the same as that of the scale bridging method .",
    "the present hybrid method is also similar to the connffesit approach@xcite in that the macroscopic local stresses are obtained from the configurations of polymer molecules . in the present method , however , we couple a cfd simulation with an md simulation which involves full interactions of each molecule rather than the stochastic dynamics of single model polymers lacking any direct interactions between molecules .",
    "thus the present method can reproduce flow behaviors caused by the many - body effect , which is quite important , especially in the glassy polymers . in previous work@xcite , we investigated the efficiency and accuracy of the hybrid method .",
    "we also clarified the property of noise arising in the hybrid method by comparing the results of the hybrid method with those from fluctuating hydrodynamics .",
    "in addition , we analyzed the complicated rheological properties of a supercooled polymer melt in the viscous diffusion layer arising over the rapidly oscillating plate by using the scale bridging method .    in the present paper , various flow behaviors of polymer melts between the parallel plates",
    "are simulated using the scale bridging method .",
    "creep motion under a constant shear stress and its recovery motion in the stress - free state , pressure - driven flows , and flows in rapidly oscillating plates are investigated . in the creep / recovery simulation , the evident elastic motion of polymer melt is demonstrated . the result",
    "is also compared with that from a model constitutive relation . for pressure - driven flow ,",
    "the velocity profiles of melts with various temperatures and pressure gradients are demonstrated .",
    "the shear - thinning behaviors of melts are also investigated . in the problem of oscillating plates , the viscous boundary layer arising over the oscillating plate and rheological properties of the boundary layer are investigated for various temperatures , frequencies of the plate , and amplitudes of strain of the system .",
    "the parameter sets used in the present paper are different from those used in the previous paper@xcite ; in the previous paper , the amplitude of velocity of the plate is specified as a parameter instead of the amplitude of strain of the system in the present paper .    for the problems of pressure - driven flow and oscillating plates , the velocity profiles are quite non - uniform between the plates , and two different characteristic length scales appear in each problem that must be resolved :",
    "one is that of a polymer chain , which is the scale of the md simulation , and the other is that of the flow behaviors of the melt , e.g. , the width between the plates or the thickness of boundary layer arising over the oscillating plate , which is the scale of the cfd simulation .",
    "these problems constitute important applications of multiscale modeling ; it is quite difficult to solve each problem by using a full md simulation because the width of the plates and thickness of the boundary layer are much larger than the size of a polymer chain .    in the following text ,",

    "the complicated mechanical properties depending on the microscopic configurations of polymer chains for which it is difficult to construct the model constitutive relation are also correctly involved in the cfd simulation , since the microscopic motions of polymers are resolved in the md simulations associated with each mesh node of the cfd calculation according to the local flow field .",
    "hence , the present hybrid method is expected to be applicable both to problems for the large - scale flows which are out of range of the md simulation , and the complex flows , which do not have any known model constitutive relations .",

    "thus 256 md cells with @xmath230 are associated with each node of the slits .",
    "the parallelization algorithm is applied to the process to calculate local stresses by md simulation .",
    "hence , in the parallel computations with @xmath227 cpus , each cpu is assigned to the calculations of ( 256/@xmath227 ) local stresses at each time step of the cfd .",
    "figure [ fig12 ] shows the result of the benchmarks .",
    "the parallel computations are performed nearly ideal until the number of cpu @xmath227is one - hundred twenty - eight , @xmath231 .",
    "the efficiency of parallel computation @xmath232 defined by @xmath233 , where @xmath226 is the computational time for @xmath227 parallelization , is more than 99% up to @xmath231 and 90% for @xmath234 .",
    "parallelization efficiency decreases a bit at @xmath227=256 in the present benchmark since cfd calculation and communication between cpus increases relative to the total computation .",
    "however , for the simulations of large - scale and slow dynamics , we can improve the parallelization efficiency even for a large number of cpus by setting the slit size and time - step size of the cfd calculation , @xmath80 and @xmath48 , large while keeping the ratios @xmath81 and @xmath235 constant ( because the ratio of cfd calculation computation time to the total time decreases . ) although the total computation time dose indeed increases , the efficiency of the hybrid simulation compared to the full md simulation does not change .",

    "we are involved with only one - dimensional problems .",

    "many novel simulation methods have been proposed.@xcite incorporating the present hybrid technique into well - established simulation methods for the visco - elastic flows represents an important direction for future research .",
