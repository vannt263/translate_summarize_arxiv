    "based on n - body simulations of cosmological large - scale structure formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a significant ( 3050% ) fraction of baryons are thought to reside in a ` warm - hot ' gaseous phase ( @xmath3  k ) , which is hard to detect with the instruments currently in operation .",
    "this warm - hot gas , whose density is @xmath4@xmath5 , is called the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) .",
    "firm detection of the whim is important because it is the most promising candidate for the `` missing baryons '' ; i.e. , it is thought to explain the discrepancy between the baryon density observed in the local universe @xcite and that in the distant universe @xcite or that calculated from the observed fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "although @xmath6 of the baryons has been resolved as the whim in the temperature range @xmath7  k through absorption features observed with _ fuse _ and _ hst _",
    "@xcite , more baryons are thought to reside in a hotter phase at @xmath8  k. the whim of this temperature may be detected via emission or absorption lines from highly ionized elements in x - ray spectra , such as and .    despite many observations",
    "so far , the existence of the whim in the hotter phase is not yet confirmed .",
    "studies of the whim using absorption lines only lead to one disputed detection toward mkn  421 @xcite , a result which was not confirmed later and was thus questioned @xcite .",
    "possible detections of emission from the whim have been reported in cluster outskirts , as a soft x - ray ( @xmath9  kev ) excess containing and lines .",
    "the origin of o line emission is , however , controversial due to strong galactic and solar system foreground emission , which has a spectral shape similar to the whim .",
    "in particular , x - rays induced by solar wind charge exchange ( swcx ) could produce serious contamination because of its high variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "note that there has been no detection of redshifted emission lines from the whim so far .",
    "the most prominent thermal soft excess ever reported is in the coma outskirts , especially in the coma-11 field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fbh03 ) .",
    "fbh03 also observed spatial variation within the coma outskirts ; coma-7 shows roughly five times smaller intensity than coma-11 .",
    "not only o lines , but also an euv excess @xcite and marginal detection of emission and absorption lines ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter t07 ) are reported in the coma outskirts .",
    "these results may support the existence of the whim .",
    "we observed the coma-11 and coma-7 fields with the xis @xcite onboard _",
    "@xcite , in order to make clear the origin of the excess .",
    "the xis is an ideal instrument to study the emission lines from the whim , because it does not show a large low - energy tail in the pulse - height distribution function , even in the very soft ( @xmath10 ) band .",
    "we assume a hubble constant of 70 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 or @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",

    "this did not improve the fit . to obtain robust upper limits of line intensities ,",
    "we consider systematic uncertainties in calibration : the centroid energy ( @xmath58  ev ) , the energy resolution ( 1080  ev fwhm ) , energy scale ( @xmath59  ev ) , and the contamination thickness ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 upper limits we obtained for , , , and are 1.4 , 2.7 , 0.5 , and 0.9  lu for coma-11 and 2.6 , 3.7 , 1.2 , and 1.1  lu for coma-7 , respectively .",

    "then , and @xmath1 upper limits are 2.8 and 2.9  lu for coma-11 and 3.5 and 3.9  lu for coma-7 , respectively .",
    "we measured the spectra of coma-11 and coma-7 with the suzaku xis .",
    "the spectra were fitted with a single thin thermal plasma model and the emission from the whim was not confirmed .",
    "here we compare our results with previous _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "we do not discuss the lower energy excess ( @xmath64  kev ) observed with rosat and euve , because the xis is not sensitive in the energy .",
    "fbh03 observed coma-11 and coma-7 with _ xmm - newton_. the and intensity measured in fbh03 are @xmath65 and @xmath66 lu in coma-11 , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 lu in coma-7 , respectively .",
    "the intensities of coma-7 in fbh03 are consistent with our _ suzaku _ observation , while those of coma-11 are discrepant at the @xmath69 level .",
    "the best - fit icm temperature and abundance in coma-11 are also inconsistent .",
    "even if we fixed the temperature and abundance to the best - fit values of fbh03 , the discrepancies of the o line intensities remain as large .",
    "the o intensities observed with _",
    "suzaku _ are similar to those of coma-7 ; we did not confirm the spatial variation .",
    "t07 measured , and emission line intensities with _ xmm - newton _ in the field of x com and four background fields whose distance from ngc  4874 is 46.2162.7  arcmin .",
    "the intensities of , and lines measured by t07 are @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72  lu in the x com field and @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , in the ( averaged ) background fields , respectively .",
    "the values of the x com field shown above contain contributions of the background emission .",
    "the intensities of the x com field are consistent within 90% confidence range with those of the coma-11 and coma-7 measured in this work , and those of the background field of t07 are also consistent with those of comabkg .",
    "the origin of the large discrepancy in coma-11 o intensities between this work and fbh03 could be contamination by swcx emission .",
    "the solar wind proton flux observed with ace ( advanced composition explorer ) showed flares both during coma-11 observation of fbh03 ( 2.5@xmath76 ) and during comabkg observation of this work ( 1.5@xmath76 ) as shown in figure  [ fig - solarwind ] . both are @xmath77 times larger than the quiescent state around each observation time .",
    "hence , two possibilities should be considered : o intensities of coma-11 in fbh03 are overestimated , or those of comabkg in this work are overestimated and thus those of coma-11 in this work are underestimated . however , the latter case is not likely because the o - line intensities are consistent with or even smaller than t07 measurements of background fields around the coma cluster .",
    "there is no indication of the geocoronal swcx emission ; the first point in the line of sight ( los ) where the geomagnetic field started open was always higher than 10 times earth radiustsyganenko / modeling.html ) , with cdaweb solar - wind parameters ( http://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/cdaweb/sp_phys/ ) ] @xcite , and there was no variation in the and flux during the comabkg observation .",
    "the heliospheric swcx emission could be weak since it is faint at solar minimum on the high ecliptic lattitude line of sight",
    ". moreover , even in the case that the comabkg observation was heavily contaminated with the swcx emission , the @xmath1 upper limits of coma-11 and intensity would be no larger than 4.8  lu and 3.5  lu , respectively , which are still lower than values of fbh03 .",
    "these values are calculated by assuming the lower limits of and intensities as the lhb contribution without any mwh contribution , measured toward a molecular cloud mbm  12 ( 3.5  lu and 0  lu , respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , it is more likely that the fbh03 observation suffered heliospheric swcx contamination , since a similar solar wind flare during _ xmm - newton _ observation of the hubble deep field north increased the and flux by @xmath78 and @xmath79 lu , respectively . the solar cycle at the observations , the position of the earth and the los , which also affects the x - ray flux induced by swcx , are similar between the two observations .",
    "note that the observation of fbh03 was performed at solar maximum , while our observation was at solar minimum .",
    "the field - to - field variation of and flux reported by fbh03 might also be due to the variation of the swcx flux .",
