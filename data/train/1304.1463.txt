    "the study of water wave is one of the oldest branches of hydrodynamics .",
    "it can be dated back to the year 1687 when newton did an experiment with u - tube and got the result `` the frequency of deep - water waves must be proportional to the inverse of the square root of the wave length '' .",
    "as reviewed by craik ( 2004 ) , the classical wave theories were mainly developed by the scientists from france , germany and britain in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries . among all of them ,",
    "the representative works are given by airy ( 1845 ) for linear wave , stokes ( 1847 ) for nonlinear wave , gerstner ( 1802 ) for cycloid wave and earnshaw ( 1847 ) for solitary wave .",
    "after that time , the progresses are under the existing framework and on the wave - breaking investigation ( banner , 1993 ) , the wind - wave growing mechanism ( phillips , 1957 ; miles , 1957 ; janssen , 2009 ) , the wave - spectrum construction ( phillips , 1977 ; wen and yu , 1984 ) together with its applications in numerical ocean - wave forecast ( cavaleri et al , 2007 ; mitsuyasu , 2002 ) .",
    "one can also refer to the special issue `` ocean surface waves '' of _ ocean modeling _",
    ", vol.70 ( 2013 ) for the latest developments on these aspects .",
    "the present article aims at constructing a new model other than those given by airy , stokes and gerstner . as for the solitary wave on shallow water given by earnshaw ,",
    "it is beyond the topic of periodic wave in deep water and is omitted here .",
    "the default form of water wave is the so - called `` gravity wave '' on the ocean surface .    to carry out the new modeling",
    ", it needs some reviews on the classical wave models .",
    "the classical linear wave theory in nowadays textbooks , such as those by andersen and frigaard ( 2011 ) , soloviev and lukas(2006 ) and dean and dalrymple ( 1991 ) , mostly follows from the model of airy ( 1845 ) .",
    "as the problem concerned , the default model should be the inviscid and incompressible navier - stokes equations .",
    "but the solving of these equations involves in determining the upper surface boundary condition which is just the wave to look for ( stewart , 2005 ) .",
    "this nonlinear characteristic makes the problem insoluble in essence .",
    "so , the classical results for surface waves are merely some kind of approximations and the linear wave is the simplest one .",
    "in fact , even the trigonometric wave forms themselves are some kind of conjectures . here",
    "the cartesian coordinate system is adopted and only the 2-dimensional case is concerned . the origin is chosen at the motionless water level with @xmath0 and @xmath1 pointing to the propagating direction and the upward direction separately .    on the assumption that the amplitude @xmath2 is infinitely small relative to the wave - length @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , that is , @xmath5 and the upper boundary can be almostly seen as a fixed flat surface , there is a linear approximation for the problem . at this time",
    ", the surface traveling wave can be conjectured in the simplest trigonometric form : @xmath6 for the deep - water case with irrotational hypothesis on the flow , the solving of the simplified navier - stokes equations yields depth - dependent profiles for the wave and pressure : @xmath7   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] together with a relation : @xmath8 which is known as the `` dissipation relation '' . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the constant air pressure on the surface and the water density . here",
    "we have omitted the horizontal and vertical velocities @xmath11 and @xmath12 which can be also outputted from the solving process .    by aid of dissipation relation ,",
    "the wave - speed is derived to be @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the period which is related to frequency by @xmath15 .",
    "this formula indicates that a wave with lower frequency or lower wave - number should travel faster .    besides the limitation @xmath16",
    ", there is another shortcoming for the linear wave model : _ it does not break and its theory is not suitable for wave - breaking problem_.      in case @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is not infinitely small , there is a finite - amplitude stokes wave model owing to stokes ( 1847 ) . for this case ,",
    "the surface wave and dispersion relation for the deep - water case is approximated by the asymptotic expansion technique : @xmath19gk   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath20 ( soloviev and lukas , 2006 ; wen and yu , 1984 ; stewart , 2005 ) .",
    "the corresponding pressure profile can be approximated by : @xmath21 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    relative to the linear wave , the stokes wave looses the request on the wave steepness @xmath17 and it yields three brand - new results : ( 1 ) it accords well with the actual one which has sharp crests and flat troughs ; ( 3 ) the asymmetry of crest and trough lifts the equilibrium to the height @xmath22 higher than the motionless water level ; ( 3 ) the particle s trajectory is not a closed circle , the water body has a mean drifting velocity ( known as `` stokes drift '' ) : @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the water depth with a negative sign .",
    "the surface stokes drift accords with the case @xmath25 .    for a too big steepness @xmath26 which accords with a too sharp crest",
    "the stokes wave may break down ( massel , 2007 ) .",
    "so it is suitable for wave - breaking problem and the criteria given by stokes are seen as classical ones nowadays .",
    "the shortcoming lies in the irrotational - flow hypothesis .      on the assumption that the particle s trajectory is a circle , gerstner ( 1802 ) found a rotational cycloid wave ( known as `` gerstner wave '' ) .",
    "it is an exact solution of lagrangian form in deep water ( soloviev and lukas , 2006 ) : @xmath27 z(x_0 , z_0 , t)=z_0-ae^{kz_0}\\sin(kx_0-\\omega t ) , \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath28 denotes the equilibrium of the water particle which can be seen as a location shift from that for initial time @xmath29 in the strict lagrangian frame .",
    "we note that , for convenience of comparison with the following new model , a translation is done on the phase angle by @xmath30 .",
    "to ensure the pressure at the free surface @xmath31 be a constant ( the dynamic boundary condition ) , it requires a dispersion relation @xmath32 same to the linear wave . for this case , the water pressure should satisfy ( wen and yu , 1984 ) : @xmath33 which has noting to do with the variables @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    "that is , the water pressure is merely in the depth - dependent form @xmath36 and does not change during the process of wave motion .",
    "it is very special .",
    "our common sense is that : to support the @xmath35-periodic wave motion , the pressure should also vary in a @xmath35-periodic manner , such as in eqns.(1.3 ) and ( 1.8 ) .",
    "relative to the stokes wave , its advantages lie in the concise expression and the abandon of irrotational hypothesis . to some extent",
    ", it accords better with the actual one which has sharp crests and flat troughs . however , its descriptive power is limited , after all , not all waves have circular particle trajectories . to accord with the physics ,",
    "it need reforming .",
    "from the previous analysis we know the traditional approaches given by airy , stokes and gerstner take the conjectured wave forms as the preconditions or approximate it with asymptotic expansion technique .",
    "what is more , the water pressures are given as corollaries in the last .",
    "here we take an inverse approach to do it .",
    "let the wave model be the object , the conjecture is done on the pressure .    to make modeling here we follow the fundamental assumptions adopted by the classical models : ( 1 ) the fluid is inviscid and incompressible ;",
    "( 2 ) the effect of surface tension is neglectable ; ( 3 ) the particle at the water surface always maintains at it during the reciprocating process ; ( 4 ) the water is deep relative to the concerned wave .",
    "take one water particle as the research object , we describe it by lagrangian coordinates @xmath37 .",
    "its motion satisfies the equations ( price , 2006 ) : @xmath38 here @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the simple denotations of the accelerations @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "it requires the knowledge of water pressure .      for a hydrostatic case , in case",
    "the density can be seen as a constant , the water pressure @xmath43 increases linearly along with the water - layer thickness @xmath44 , that is , @xmath45 .",
    "when the fluid is flowing with a wave motion designated by @xmath31 on the upper surface , the water pressure roughly obeys this rule with @xmath46,\\ ] ] this is the so - called `` quasi - hydrostatic approximation '' usually adopted in physical oceanography ( stewart , 2005 ) .",
    "as the problem concerned , if this kind of approximation is adopted , then it follows from eqn.(2.1 ) that @xmath47 .",
    "this means the vertical velocity almost keep unchanged .",
    "it is impossible !",
    "the common sense is that the vertical velocities at the crest and the trough are all zero but those at the mean level are not zero .    besides the quasi - hydrostatic approximation",
    "there is another case , might as well , call it by `` gravitational approximation '' .",
    "as analyzed in the previous section , if the gravity is the main restoring force for the wave motion , then there should be @xmath48 as the particle at the crest part .",
    "for this case , @xmath49 .",
    "this means there is no relative vertical force between two arbitrary water layers .",
    "hence , the horizontal pressure gradient force due to the slant water body is empty which leads to @xmath50 .",
    "this is also a strange case .    as analyzed above , the `` quasi - hydrostatic approximation '' and the `` gravitational approximation ''",
    "are two extreme cases : the vertical pressure gradient force is too strong for the first case and too weak for the second case . with this understanding ,",
    "we conjecture the pressure in an eclectic way .",
    "notice that the water pressures ( eqns.(1.3 ) and ( 1.8 ) ) for the linear wave and stokes wave are deduced from the navier - stokes equations , their forms should be more objective and have more reference values .",
    "enlightened by these we estimate the pressure by @xmath51.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression is a modified version with @xmath24 substituting @xmath1 in the exponential function . for this case ,",
    "the free surface @xmath31 with equilibrium at @xmath25 accords well with the dynamic boundary condition @xmath52 .",
    "we note that the incorporating of @xmath24 here is permitted .",
    "in fact , under the lagrangian frame , the functions @xmath53 and @xmath43 can be all expressed by the variables @xmath54 and @xmath35 . yet , under the euler frame whose variables are @xmath53 and @xmath35 , it is strange to incorporate @xmath24 into eqns.(1.3 ) and ( 1.8 ) .",
    "it is a reasonable hypothesis that , during the moving process , a small cubic water body keeps its shape from @xmath55 to @xmath56 ( price , 2006 ) .",
    "for this case , @xmath57 it follows from eqns.(2.1 ) , ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) that @xmath58 _ these mean the horizontal motion is due to the pressure - gradient force caused by the slant water body and the vertical motion is due to the variation of the surface elevation ( can be understood as the variation in the previous period , it squeezes the water body and leads to new vertical motion ) . _",
    "to simply the horizontal acceleration , we take the wave slope @xmath59 as a parameter and denote @xmath60 the average of its absolute value over a wave - length respect to the fixed time @xmath29 , that is , @xmath61 here the position of wave trough is set on @xmath62 .",
    "we note that @xmath60 is the real wave steepness ( wave slope ) , it relates to the common one @xmath17 by @xmath63 .    with this simplicity , the horizontal acceleration can be further approximated by @xmath64 -\\delta g e^{kz_0 } , \\;\\quad { \\partial\\xi}/{\\partial x}>0 .",

    "we consider the surface wave which accords with @xmath25 .",
    "notice that it is a synthesis of transversal wave and longitudinal wave , with the aid of the deduced accelerations , we decompose the motion into the vertical part and horizontal part and model them separately .    to be simple",

    "we note that the effect of current is left out . in case @xmath76",
    "there should be a discussion on the wave - current interaction .",
    "to describe the vertical motion distinctly we divide it into three stages : ( 1 ) from the zero - level to the crest ; ( 2 ) from the crest to the trough ; ( 3 ) from the trough to the zero - level .    in view of eqn.(2.9 )",
    "the upward velocity of the first stage satisfies @xmath77 its corresponding displacement is @xmath78ds     = w_0 t-\\frac{\\pi}{3t}\\delta g t^3 .",

    "for example , if the observed amplitude and slope are @xmath84 m and @xmath85 , then its period is about @xmath86s .",
    "this is a wind wave . as for the swell ,",
    "only if the wave steepness is as low as @xmath87 , its period can attain @xmath88s ( ardhuin et al , 2009 ) .",
    "certainly , notice that @xmath89 and @xmath15 , this formula can be transformed to the form of dissipation relation : @xmath90    with the help of eqn.(2.9 ) , we repeat the above deduction process on the other two stages and get a combined displacement of piecewise cubic - polynomial form : @xmath91\\\\[2 mm ]    \\pi \\delta g ( t/2-t ) [ t/16-(t/2-t)^2/{3 t } ] ,   \\enskip t\\in [ t/4 , 3t/4],\\\\[2 mm ]      \\pi \\delta g ( t - t ) [ t/16-(t - t)^2/{3 t } ] ,     \\quad t\\in [ 3t/4 , t ] .",

    "so the maximum amplitude is @xmath96 the other three stages can be considered in the same way .",
    "the final displacement relative to the equilibrium at @xmath97 is in the form of piecewise quadratic - polynomial : @xmath98\\\\[2 mm ]   3a/\\pi-\\delta g ( t - t/2)^2/2 ,   \\quad t\\in [ t/4 , 3t/4],\\\\[2 mm ]    -3a/\\pi + \\delta g(t - t)^2/2 ,   \\quad t\\in [ 3t/4 , t ] .",

    "each time the phase angle is corrected by a periodic one with magnitude @xmath130 .    in addition , due to the horizontal motion of the surface particle , the asymptotic expansion technique for stokes wave is awkward in approximating the free surface @xmath31 .",
    "but in fact , the second - order approximation of our nested form is enough to reflect the crest - trough asymmetry .",
    "the study of the physical and dynamical characteristics of gravity waves on the sea surface while they break and the subsequent foam activity and formation of drop - spray clouds are amongst the major problems facing modern satellite oceanology , physics of the ocean - atmosphere interaction , and oceanic engineering ( sharkov , 2007 ) .",
    "the breaking phenomenon is usually associated with steep waves at the sea surface . to divide from the research objects , there are two classes of criteria for wave - breaking : the first is related to the characteristic of the surface elevation and the second is related to observations of air entrainment , whitecaps or ambient noise . here",
    "only the first class is concerned .",
    "more than one hundred years ago , stokes had brought forth a finite - amplitude wave theory and established a set of criteria for wave - breaking ( massel , 2007 ) : + _ ( a ) the particle s velocity at the wave crest @xmath131 equals to the wave speed @xmath132 [ ] ; + ( b ) the wave crest attains a sharp point with an angle of @xmath133 , that is , the upper wave part accords with a mean slant angle @xmath134 [ ] ; + ( c ) the wave steepness in terms of @xmath135 approximates @xmath136 , here @xmath137 stand for the wave height [ ] ; + ( d ) the particle s acceleration at the crest estimated under the polar - coordinate frame is @xmath138 , here @xmath139 is the gravity acceleration [ ] .",
    "_    these four criteria are seen as classical ones nowadays . among all of them ,",
    "the kinematic criterion is the fundamental one which accords with the fact : _ this position represents the stagnation point of the fluid - particle s streamline relative to the wave form_. downstream from this point , fluid particles tend to escape from the water surface .",
    "they can either be ejected into air to become droplets or curl down to trap air into water .",
    "the other three criteria are merely limiting approximations to the steepest wave with a preset velocity potential of polar - coordinate form @xmath140 in the crest region , where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the coefficients to be evaluated .",
    "certainly , the different choices of velocity potential with different simplicities of the equations imply the different criteria and the successors have given a variety of modifications for them .",
    "for example , in 1977 longuet - higgins modified the slant angle and the acceleration criterions to be @xmath143 and @xmath144 ( massel , 2007 ) .",
    "essentially , the stokes wave can not be directly used for wave - breaking investigation due the form @xmath31 .",
    "so the indirect approach is adopted .",
    "however , the wave of lagrangian form @xmath145 can be directly used due to the advantage of reflecting the particle s horizontal motion . in the following",
    "we abandon the velocity - potential approach and restudy this problem with the newly derived model . to make comparison between the piecewise polynomial form and the trigonometric form , we see the first one with lower smoothness is more preferable , after all , the wave with a too sharp crest is not smooth .",
    "relative to the linear wave @xmath146 and the stokes wave in eqns.(1.6 ) ( its equilibrium is adjusted to @xmath147 with adding @xmath148 ) , the new model has more distinct physical meaning and it accords better with the actual one which has a sharp crest and a flat trough ( see _ figure 4 _ ) . in fact , this asymmetry roots in the horizontal displacement of the surface particle .",
    "according to eqn.(3.3 ) , in one wavelength @xmath3 the crest part and the trough part possess lengths @xmath149 separately .",
    "so , a bigger @xmath60 implies a sharper crest and this characteristic can be used to forecast the wave - breaking .",
    "notice that the kinematic criterion given by stokes is a generally accepted one , we take it as a theoretical basis and give further deduction .",
    "we note here that the kinematic criterion can not be directly used since it involves in determining the wave speed and surface - particle s velocity at the wave crest .      on the one hand",
    ", it follows from the modeling process that the surface particle at the wave crest possesses a zero vertical velocity and a maximum horizontal velocity : @xmath150 here the formula ( 2.13 ) for @xmath14 is used . on the other hand , it follows from eqn.(4.2 ) that @xmath151 .",
    "to meet the kinematic criterion it requires @xmath152 which leads to @xmath153 this is a steepness type of criterion which is higher than the one given by stokes since , at this time , the critical case reads @xmath154 .",
    "the above steepness type of criterion can be also transformed to the angle type .",
    "notice that the wave steepness @xmath155 is actually the averaged wave slope , these two type are equivalent to each other .",
    "hence , the steepest wave should possess a mean slant angle : @xmath156 which is slightly lower than @xmath157 and @xmath158 given by stokes and longuet - higgins , respectively .    in case",
    "the asymmetry property is considered , the crest part should possess a critical wave slope @xmath159 which results in @xmath160 .",
    "_ this indicates that a wave with front angle bigger than @xmath161 must break .",
    "_ it has more guiding significance than the mean one , after all , more often than not the superposition of two non - breaking wave may result in a breaking crest ( see _ figure 7 _ ) which can not be well scaled by other approaches .",
    "as for the trough part , the critical slope should be @xmath162 which accords with a slant angle @xmath163 .",
    "we note that the acceleration criterion is not preferred for our model .",
    "the reason is that , the horizontal acceleration of the surface particle has no definition at the crest . before the particle attains the crest it is @xmath93 and after the crest it turns to @xmath164 .",
    "but their magnitudes @xmath165 approximate @xmath166 given by stokes .",
    "besides the horizontal acceleration , there is also a vertical one with @xmath167 at the crest .",
    "if the wave of trigonometric form is adopted , the higher - order smoothness of it may postpone the occurrence of wave - breaking .",
    "it follows from eqn.(5.1 ) that @xmath168 which yields a maximum horizontal velocity at the crest with @xmath97 and @xmath169 : @xmath170 to ensure @xmath152 it only requires @xmath171 which accords with a critical mean - slope angle @xmath172 . for this case ,",
    "the critical front slope and front angle are @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "relative to @xmath161 derived from the original form , to approximate the wave with trigonometric function may result in an error @xmath175 to the critical front angle .",
    "certainly , the original piecewise polynomial form is also an approximation to the actual wave .",
    "these results are left to be checked by observations .",
    "it follows from the previous section that @xmath176 is the theoretical critical mean - slope .",
    "so in case @xmath177 the wave should break and on the contrary it does nt . in the following we check it by numerical approach .",
    "firstly , we make a simulation on the effect of wave slope .",
    "it follows from _ figure 5 _ that a bigger wave slope accords with a sharper crest . from the sub - figure",
    "we see the breaking characteristic is very obvious in case @xmath178 ( indicated by the small curl at the crest ) .",
    "in fact , the breaking has already occurred just bigger than @xmath179 . to find the exact critical value of @xmath60 it needs zooming in the crest part . from _ figure 6 _",
    "we see the breaking does not occur for the case @xmath180 ( @xmath181 ) and does surely occur at @xmath182 .",
    "this test indicates that @xmath176 is indeed a critical mean - slope . in another word",
    ", the critical front slope should be @xmath183 and it can be taken as a feasible wave - breaking criterion .",
    "the numerical results in _ figure 5 _ also imply the smaller the wave slope the closer the curve to the sinusoidal one .",
    "this reflects the consistency of the new model and the linear model .",
    "in addition , the breaking criteria @xmath184 for the trigonometric form can be also tested in the same way .",
    "_ figure 7 _ shows the superposition of two waves .",
    "it is easy to see from that the superimposed wave has many breaking crests , though these are the non - breaking ones with @xmath85 and @xmath185 separately .",
    "beside the advantages mentioned in _ section 6.2 _ , there is still a shortcoming for this new model : its particle trajectory is a closed one . to keep up with the stokes wave",
    ", it should be able to reflect the wave drift . in the following ,",
    "we improve the model by substituting the mean - slope @xmath60 with two local slopes for the crest and trough parts defined in _ section6.2.1 _ : @xmath186 notice that this change mainly affects the horizontal motion and there is little influence on the vertical one , we pay our attention to the horizontal remodeling .    for this case , the horizontal acceleration in eqn.(2.7 ) is substituted by @xmath187 -\\delta^ * g e^{kz_0 } , \\quad z>0,\\ ; { \\partial\\xi}/{\\partial x}>0,\\\\[2 mm ] -\\delta _ * g e^{kz_0 } , \\quad z<0,\\ ; { \\partial\\xi}/{\\partial x}>0,\\\\[2 mm ] \\delta _ * g e^{kz_0 } , \\quad z<0,\\ ; { \\partial\\xi}/{\\partial x}<0 . \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to repeat the deduction process in _ section 2.3 _ it yields a reformed traveling wave ( ): @xmath188,\\\\[2 mm ] x_0+\\alpha_1-\\beta_1\\left(\\theta-\\pi\\right)^2,\\enskip \\theta\\in[\\pi/2,\\pi],\\\\[2 mm ] x_0+\\alpha_1-\\beta_2\\left(\\theta-\\pi\\right)^2,\\enskip \\theta\\in[\\pi,3\\pi/2],\\\\[2 mm ] x_0-\\sigma_2+\\beta_2 ( \\theta-2\\pi)^2,\\;\\ ; \\theta\\in[3\\pi/2,2\\pi ] ,   \\end{array }     \\right.\\\\   & & z(x_0,t)=\\left\\ {   \\begin{array}{ll }   -\\beta_0 \\theta(\\gamma-\\theta^2)/3,\\quad\\theta\\in[0 , \\pi/2],\\\\[2 mm ]   \\beta_0(\\theta-\\pi)[\\gamma-(\\theta-\\pi)^2]/3,\\;\\;\\theta\\in[\\pi/2,3\\pi/2],\\\\[2 mm ] -\\beta_0(\\theta-2\\pi)[\\gamma-(\\theta-2\\pi)^2]/3,\\;\\theta\\in[3\\pi/2,2\\pi ]   \\end{array }     \\right .",

    "for simplicity , the improved trigonometric forms in eqn.(7.5 ) and ( 7.6 ) are used here .",
    "it follows from _ figure 8 _ that the particle s trajectory is no longer a closed one and there is a distinct drift .",
    "in fact , for a particle with equilibrium at depth @xmath24 , on each period @xmath14 its drift distance is @xmath200 .",
    "so the drift velocity is : @xmath201 which only relies on @xmath202 and @xmath24 .",
    "relative to the stokes drift @xmath203 ( @xmath204 stands for the wave speed in its own frame ) , the newly derived one yields a much lower wave drift ( @xmath205 m/s for @xmath206 ) whose magnitude is more rational ( see _ figure 9 _ ) .",
    "the surface drift estimated by stokes ( @xmath207 m/s for @xmath208 ) is too strong to meet the common sense .",
    "it is rare to observe a current of several - knots at sea , not to say the drift for the particle s trajectory .",
    "by modeling approach we have deduced a new model for the ocean surface wave which differs from the classical ones given by airy ( the linear wave model ) , stokes ( the nonlinear wave model ) and gerstner ( the cycloid wave model ) .",
    "the corresponding dissipation relation is @xmath209 in terms of amplitude @xmath2 and slope @xmath60 , the wave parameters can be rewritten as @xmath210 these kind of relations have more guiding significants for the field observations .",
    "the new understandings on wave mechanism are as follows : + _ ( 1 ) a wave with bigger amplitude or smaller slope should travel faster ( the common sense is that : lower frequency or lower wave - number implies faster ) ; + ( 2 ) the critical mean - slope and front - slope for wave - breaking are @xmath176 and @xmath183 which accord with slant angles @xmath211 and @xmath161 separately ( stokes s front angle is @xmath157 ) ; + ( 3 ) the new formula indicates that the magnitude of wave drift should be smaller than that of the known stokes drift . _      in case the wave is under a developing process , the first relation can give a well guidance to its variation .",
    "that is to say , along with the increasing of amplitude @xmath2 , its period increases in a clear way with @xmath212 .",
    "it follows from _ figure 10 _ that if the wave amplitude is increased from @xmath213 m to @xmath214 m then the corresponding period should increase from @xmath215s to @xmath216s provided that the slope maintains unchanged with @xmath217 .",
    "the first formula can be also used in a reverse way .",
    "notice that the amplitude is @xmath218 , we can express the wave energy ( the factor @xmath219 is dropped ) by @xmath220 therefore , the energy relies not only on the frequency but also on the steepness , that is , @xmath221 .",
    "this theoretical result is helpful for improving the existing wave - spectrum theories whose main usages are to find the relations between @xmath222 and @xmath2 by considering the stochastic ocean surface as a superposition of a series of linear waves .",
    "this formula is close to the theoretical zakharov - filonenko spectrum with @xmath223 ( cavaleri et al , 2007 ) ; the empirical pierson - moscowitz and jonswap spectrums with @xmath224 ( janssen , 2009 ) and the empirical neumann spectrum with @xmath225 ( wen and yu , 1984 ) . certainly , to reconstruct the wave - spectrum theory needs investigating the distribution of wave - slope @xmath60 at sea .",
    "it requires further research .",
    "there is a necessity to compare the new model with the classical ones .",
    "as the modeling approach concerned , the traditional ones given by airy , stokes and gerstner take the conjectured wave forms as the preconditions or approximate it with asymptotic expansion technique .",
    "what is more , the unknown water pressures are given as corollaries in the last .",
    "our approach is an inverse one : the conjecture is done on the pressure , to deduce the wave form is taken as an object .",
    "the new idea is to consider the local lagrangian motion of the surface particle with newton s second law .    the new model is originally developed in a piecewise polynomial form which has distinct physical meaning .",
    "it accords well with the actual one which has a sharp crest and a flat trough .",
    "its approximated trigonometric form is very close to the gerstner wave ; its approximated free - surface form takes the linear wave as a limiting case ; the nested fashion for the free - surface form is superior to the asymptotic expansion technique adopted by the stokes wave . in addition , the improved model can also reflect the wave drift and its magnitude is more rational than the one given by stokes .",
