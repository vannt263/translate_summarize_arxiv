    "optical studies of stellar populations in external galaxies beyond the virgo cluster are limited to investigations based on the integrated light of the stars in smaller or larger parts of the galaxies .",
    "radial gradients can be studied , but the individual stars can not be resolved with present day instrumentation .",
    "the interpretation of the observations therefore relies on models of the stellar populations .",
    "since baade ( 1944 ) introduced the idea of stellar populations in external galaxies broad band colors have been used for observational studies as well as modeling of stellar populations ( e.g. , tinsley & gunn 1976 ; aaronson et al .",

    "line strengths for galaxies have been measured in this system by , e.g. , gorgas , efstathiou & aragn - salamanca ( 1990 ) , worthey , faber & gonzles ( 1992 ) , davidge ( 1992 ) , davies , sadler & peletier ( 1993 ) , carollo , danziger & buson ( 1993 ) , fisher , franx & illingworth ( 1995 , 1996 ) and vazdekis et al .",
    "( 1996ab ) .",
    "recent stellar population models have made predictions of the line indices in the lick / ids system , the broad band colors and the mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratio for single stellar populations ( buzzoni , gariboldi & mantegazza 1992 ; worthey 1994 ; buzzoni , mantegazza & gariboldi 1994 ; vazdekis et al .",
    "1996a ; bressan , chiosi & tantalo 1996 ) .",
    "these models are static models in the sense that the aim is not to model the evolution of a stellar system , but to predict the observables for one stellar population with a given age , metallicity and initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "worthey and bressan et al .",
    "use a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf , while buzzoni et al .  and vazdekis et al .",
    "present models for several imfs .",
    "most of the available models use solar abundance ratios , specifically [ mg / fe]=0 .",
    "current static models with [ mg / fe]=0 fail to reproduce the observed flat relation between the magnesium index @xmath1 and the iron index @xmath2 found for elliptical galaxies ( worthey et al .",
    "1992 ; buzzoni et al .",
    "weiss et al .  (",
    "1995 ) studied the effect of a non - solar [ mg / fe ] and estimated that bright elliptical galaxies have [ mg / fe ] in the interval + 0.3 to + 0.7 .",
    "some authors have investigated the possibility of fitting evolutionary models to the stellar populations in elliptical galaxies .",
    "even though beyond the scope of this paper , we note that the main problem is to create sufficiently enriched and old populations of stars that will fit the red colors and strong line indices characteristic for elliptical galaxies .",
    "vazdekis et al .",
    "( 1996ab ) find that some process is needed to supply a strong enrichment early in the evolution of the galaxies .",
    "they argue that a time variable imf may be feasible .",
    "bressan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) use an infall model to fit line index data from gonzles ( 1993 ) and uv data from burstein et al .",
    "( 1988a ) .",
    "models of single stellar populations can be used to interpret the measured line indices and broad band colors in the sense that the `` best fitting '' model gives an estimate of the luminosity weighted mean age , mean metallicity and mean imf of the current stellar populations .",
    "one of the problems with this technique is the degeneracy of the effects from variations in age and in metallicity . in general broad band colors",
    "can not be used to disentangle age and metallicity effects ( aaronson et al .",
    "1978 ; worthey 1994 ) .",
    "the possible presence of dust in e and s0 galaxies adds further confusion to the interpretation of broad band colors ( e.g. , silva & elston 1994 ) .",
    "many of the spectral indices defined in the lick / ids system suffer from the same degeneracy regarding age and metallicity .",
    "worthey ( 1994 ) argues that @xmath7 together with one of the magnesium indices can be used to break the degeneracy , since @xmath7 is more sensitive to age than the magnesium indices . in later studies jones & worthey ( 1995 ) and worthey , trager & faber ( 1995 ) use higher order balmer lines together with several indices for heavier elements to estimate mean ages and metallicities for a sample of e galaxies",
    "the current models are not in agreement with regard to the predicted near - infrared broad band colors .",
    "peletier & balcells ( 1996 ) find that near - infrared colors to some extent can be used to solve the age / metallicity degeneracy problem for e galaxies , while worthey ( 1994 ) does not find near - infrared colors useful for breaking the degeneracy .",
    "the main cause of the differences in the near - infrared colors is due to differences in the adopted models for the stellar evolution ( charlot , worthey & bressan 1996 ) .",
    "none of the techniques for breaking the age / metallicity degeneracy takes variations in the abundance ratio [ mg / fe ] into account .",
    "ideally one wants to use the observables ( the line indices , the velocity dispersion , the m / l ratio , etc . ) to derive physical parameters like the mean age , the mean abundances of various heavy elements , and the mean imf for the stellar populations presently observed . in this context",
    "it should also be addressed what the fraction of dark matter is in the galaxies .",
    "if the fraction of dark matter is not the same in all e and s0 galaxies , this may give variations in the m / l ratio that are not reflected in the observed line indices .",
    "in this paper spectroscopic data are analyzed for a large sample of cluster e and s0 galaxies .",
    "we concentrate on centrally measured indices aperture corrected to a standard size aperture .",
    "the aim is to establish empirical relations between the observables ( the velocity dispersion ; the line indices @xmath1 , @xmath7 and @xmath2 ; the m / l ratio ; and the mass ) .",
    "the underlying physical questions are ( a ) whether the mix of stellar populations is determined by the velocity dispersion ( or alternatively the mass ) , ( b ) which influence the cluster environment has , and ( c ) if the m / l ratio is determined by the stellar populations .",
    "the data are also compared to predictions from models of single stellar populations and the expected variations in the observables due to changes in the age , the abundances , the imf , and the fraction of dark matter are discussed .",
    "there are several studies of the @xmath1-@xmath4 relation for large samples of e and s0 galaxies ( burstein et al .  1988b ; guzmn et al .",
    "1992 ; bender , burstein & faber 1993 ; jrgensen , franx & kjrgaard 1996 , hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "relations that also involve @xmath7 and @xmath2 have previously only been studied for relatively small samples of galaxies ( e.g. , gorgas et al .",
    "1990 ; worthey et al .",
    "1992 ; davies et al .  1993 ; gonzles 1993 ; worthey 1994 ; fisher et al .  1995 , 1996 ) , though relations for a larger sample of e galaxies are shown by burstein et al .",

    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "sect .  2 briefly describes the samples of galaxies .",
    "the determination of the line indices is covered by sect .  3 and the appendix .",
    "4 has the empirical point of view .",
    "linear relations between the available observables are established .",
    "it is also tested how the relations depend on the cluster environment . in sect .",
    "5 the data are compared with model predictions from stellar population models .",
    "the conclusions are summarized and discussed in sect .",
    "6 .    unless otherwise noted the relations established in this paper are determined by minimization of the sum of the absolute residuals perpendicular to the relations , and the zero points are derived as the median zero points .",
    "this fitting technique has the advantage that it is rather insensitive to a few outliers , and that it treats the coordinates in a symmetric way .",
    "the uncertainties of the coefficients are derived by a bootstrap procedure .",
    "see also paper ii for a discussion of this fitting technique .",
    "the indices mgb and @xmath1 are strongly correlated .",
    "for the 161 e and s0 galaxies with both indices available we find @xmath11 with an rms scatter of 0.019 , see figure [ fig - transmg ] . for @xmath1 in the interval 0.20.35",
    "the relation is in agreement with the relation for e galaxies shown by burstein et al .",
    "this relation is overplotted on figure [ fig - transmg ] .",
    "two galaxies with uncertainty on logmgb larger than 0.08 were excluded from the fit .",
    "the relation has no significant intrinsic scatter .",
    "the relation was therefore used to derive @xmath1 from the measured mgb for those 37 galaxies where @xmath1 could not be measured because parts of the continuum bands for that index were outside the observed wavelength range .",
    "there is , as expected , a strong correlation between the indices @xmath12 and @xmath1 .",
    "we find the following relation for e and s0 galaxies @xmath13 with an rms scatter of 0.015 .",
    "the derived relation is very similar to the relation for e galaxies shown by burstein et al .",
    "the relation has no significant intrinsic scatter .",
