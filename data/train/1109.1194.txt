    "granulation was first observed by @xcite on the sun , and is widely known as the surface signature of convection , where bright cells of ascending hot gas are visible as the granules and the darker descending cool gas are the so - called `` intergranular lanes '' .",
    "these solar granules have typical sizes of about 1 mm .",
    "the study of granulation is tightly related to the analysis of convection quantities , being the most important manifestation of convection at the surface of the sun in terms of energy .",
    "other phenomena related to convection are the acoustic ( p - mode ) oscillations that reveal the internal structure of the sun .",
    "these oscillations are stochastically excited in the convective atmosphere .",
    "red giants are cool , bright , and evolved stars .",
    "they have a surface gravity , log @xmath5 , between 2 and 4 and an effective temperature , @xmath6 , in the range @xmath0  4000 to @xmath0  6000k , as defined by @xcite . for these stars ,",
    "the mass is roughly in the range 0.7 to 4@xmath9 and log(@xmath10 ) varies from 0.3 to 3 .",
    "they are interesting not only because they provide constraints on distance , age , and chemical evolution of stars , galaxies , and the extragalactic medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but they also serve as laboratories for studying convection , granulation and p - mode oscillations . as in the sun ,",
    "the inefficient , super - adiabatic convection in the upper few pressure scale - heights is host to sonic , turbulent flows that stochastically excite sound waves  these stochastic oscillations are also known as solar - like oscillations .",
    "the unambiguous detection of non - radial oscillations in red giants @xcite from photometric time series of several hundreds of red giants obtained with the corot satellite ( baglin et al .",
    "2006 ) was a significant step forward in red - giant seismology .",
    "these observations also allowed to study p - mode global parameters and their scaling laws , to estimate their masses and radii , and to even retrieve evidence of sharp features in their internal structure from , for instance , the second ionization zone of helium .",
    "the launch of nasa s _ kepler mission _",
    "@xcite in march 2009 , took the next big step in asteroseismology .",
    "the _ kepler _ field of view is 105 square degrees in the direction of cygnus and lyra and the filter of the photometer ranges from 4300 to 8800 , with a broad peak at 5900 . in total about 150000 stars",
    "are observed with high - precision photometry throughout the nominal lifetime ( 3.5 years ) of the mission . while for @xmath017000 red giants",
    "only a few months of data have been released to the public domain , , around 1500 red giants with time series longer than a year are at our disposal within the _ kepler _ asteroseismic science consortium ( kasc ) .",
    "we thus have exquisite data for studying not only the acoustic modes and their dependence on stellar parameters , but we can also , for the first time , study properties of surface convection of a large sample of red giants . the observations and data",
    "processing that we have used are described in section  [ sect : obs ] .    when studying the p modes of stars , granulation is normally considered a `` noise '' term and referred to as  background \" . in the present paper , however , we use this background signal to investigate the surface manifestation of convection and the source of p - mode excitation . in section  [",
    "sect : granparm ] different methods used to extract characteristic granulation parameters from the power spectra are described and compared . in section  [",
    "sect : scalings ] we investigate the correlations between granulation properties , stellar parameters ( mass , radius , surface gravity and @xmath6 ) and the frequency of maximum power , @xmath4 .    from a modeling point of view , convection can be treated either by 1d analytical models , or by 2 or 3d hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "the three most employed analytical models of convection are : the mixing - length theory ( mlt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , non - local mlt formulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the canuto and mazzitelli model ( cm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all of these formulations of convection are employed in stellar - structure modeling , but have severe shortcomings in the surface layers , where most of the approximations they are built on , break down .",
    "in addition to these shortcomings , the free parameters of the analytical models suffer from large uncertainties . as a result ,",
    "the analytical models have only limited predictive power .",
    "none of the analytical models deal with granulation and estimates of sizes , contrasts and flow speeds rely on a number of additional assumptions .",
    "contrary to 1d analytical models , realistic numerical simulations of convection are based on the quantum mechanics of the equation of state and opacities and the fundamental physics of radiative transfer and hydrodynamics . however , the simulations are also limited by the available computational power and hence employ various approximations to make them tractable .",
    "most of these approximations , such as the effect of a limited numerical resolution can be quantified .",
    "although 2d simulations can be run at much higher resolution , the topology of convection is fundamentally altered by the lack of a third dimension , and the properties of the 2d simulations can not be directly related to observations of stars .",
    "since the top boundary of convective envelopes occurs in the photosphere , a realistic treatment of radiative transfer is also necessary when the aim is to produce simulations that can be directly compared to observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the surface layers are , of course , the very layers we observe , which is the reason why we turn to more realistic , 3d convection simulations for guidance in the interpretation of the _ kepler _ observations .",
    "previously , used 3d red giant simulations for abundance analysis for [ fe / h ] = 0 to -3 , using the same code and atomic physics as presented here @xcite .",
    "they find metallicity effects on the granulation with increased size of the granules for increased metallicity values .",
    "some 3d radiative - hydrodynamics simulations are also done for subgiant stars @xcite . compared",
    "their 3d radiative - hydrodynamics simulation carried out with co@xmath11bold code with the corot observations of the f - type dwarf , hd  49933 .",
    "they found a significant over - estimation of the theoretical signal by a factor of two to three in total power .    in this work ,",
    "we use the simulations performed with the @xcite code and compare them to observations of @xmath0  1000 red giants .",
    "the simulations are introduced in section  5 , where we also explain the synthetic _ kepler _ data of these simulations and compare the results of the simulations with the observations .",
    "in the present investigation we used _ kepler _ observations of red giants showing solar - like oscillations , which were pre - selected for asteroseismic or astrometric purposes before launch of the spacecraft .",
    "while the asteroseismic sample is composed of subsamples with different selection criteria , the astrometric sample , which consists of the majority of our total sample , has been selected coherently .",
    "these @xmath01000 stars are selected to be 1 ) as distant as possible , to ensure small parallaxes and proper motions , 2 ) as bright as possible , but with very small chances of saturating the detector in any season , 3 ) located in fields as uncrowded as possible , and 4 ) uniformly distributed over the focal plane and not close to the edge of a ccd .",
    "this resulted in the following criteria :    * @xmath6  @xmath12  5400  k * @xmath13  @xmath12  3.8 ( c.g.s . ) * 11.0  mag  @xmath12  _ kepler _ magnitude  @xmath12  12.5  mag * crowding  @xmath14  0.95 ( i.e. very low probability of having light from another source )    @xmath6 and @xmath13 from the _ kepler input catalog _ ( kic , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been used .",
    "long - cadence ( @xmath029.4 minute sampling ) data of the first ten days ( q0 ) , the initial one - month roll ( q1 ) and each of the following three - month rolls ( q2 , q3 , q4 , and q5 ) have been used to obtain long time series of more than one year of data @xcite .",
    "we have used data processed as described in @xcite in which instrumental effects , such as satellite safe - mode events or attitude adjustments , have been removed .",
    "these effects can affect the high - frequency range when jumps happen in the light curve or the low - frequency range when a safe - mode event is observed .",
    "long - term variations have been preserved , which could contain signal of stellar origin , e.g. , granulation , but also from instrumental effects .",
    "the latter are filtered out with a procedure described below ( section  2.2 ) .    among the 1283 stars for which we have q012345 data , we have selected a sample of @xmath0  1000 red giants ( 900 to 1100 depending on the method used to analyze them ) , corresponding to the ones where different teams returned values in agreement for the mean large separation , @xmath15 , and the position of maximum power , @xmath4 .",
    "see and references therein for descriptions and comparisons of the different methods and results .      from the long - term variations preserved in the data @xcite , we need to remove the instrumental signal without affecting the granulation signal .",
    "we assume that the characteristic granulation time scale @xmath1 is of the same order as the time scale of the oscillations , as is the case for the sun . for red giants we therefore expect @xmath1 to be of the order of hours up to a few days for the largest stars of our sample .",
    "note that these equivalent time scales differ by roughly a factor of @xmath16 in the frequency domain as an e - folding time of @xmath17 in power equates to a position in the frequency domain of @xmath18 , while a wave of period @xmath19 has a frequency of @xmath20",
    ".    we have investigated effects of different high - pass filters used to remove the signature of signals with periods longer than the expected @xmath1 for red giants , which we assume to be ( partly ) due to instrumental effects .",
    "we tested different filter shapes and decided to use a triangular smooth as it introduces less ripples due to sharp edges compared to boxcar filters .",
    "additionally , we tested different filter widths of 10 , 20 , and 30 days .",
    "it showed that the wider filters result in increasingly different @xmath1 values obtained from the data , i.e. introducing a bias as well as additional scatter . from these results we concluded that a triangular smooth with a full width at half maximum of 10 days applied to an interpolated time series provides most robust results .",
    "note that the filter with a width of 10 days limits our sensitivity of @xmath1 to periods @xmath1210 days , which is sufficiently long to study the granulation in red giants under the aforementioned assumption that these are of the order of hours up to a few days .",
    "granulation parameters were first modeled in the sun by @xcite .",
    "he approximated the autocovariance of the time evolution of the granulation by an exponential decay function with a characteristic time @xmath1 .",
    "this results in a power spectrum with a lorentzian profile : @xmath21 in which @xmath22 is the total power of the signal at frequency @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the characteristic amplitude of the granulation and @xmath25 is a positive parameter characterizing the slope of the decay .",
    "we also define the amplitude of the granulation power , @xmath26 .",
    "this approach has been successfully applied to the solar measurements by several instruments in both velocity and intensity .",
    "other signals such as mesogranulation , supergranulation and active regions can be modeled with similar functions , and act at much longer time scales .",
    "we note here that it is mentioned in @xcite that the declining slopes of the functions may well be different from two .",
    "different modified harvey functions have indeed been used by for instance , @xcite , @xcite , , and in several methods used in this work , which are explained below in more detail . the use of values different from @xmath27 were established empirically , but the physical meaning of the function with @xmath25=2 has not been deeply investigated previously .    recalling that the autocorrelation of a signal is nothing but the fourier transform of its power spectrum , we can easily investigate the influence of @xmath25 on the autocorrelation function ( acf ) of the temporal signal of the granulation component .",
    "we note that , for a given @xmath17 , an increasing value for @xmath25 indicates an increase in the temporal correlation . for @xmath27 ,",
    "the acf is obviously an exponential function decaying over a time scale @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath25 tends to zero , the power spectrum becomes flatter and flatter , i.e. tends to white noise .",
    "the acf does then decrease faster and faster , and tends to a dirac function , typical for the acf of white noise . with increasing @xmath25 ,",
    "the acf broadens and converges to the sinc function for @xmath28 . to be able to compare characteristic time scales @xmath17 obtained with different @xmath25 values or",
    "even with different expressions of the granulation spectrum , we define an effective time scale @xmath29 as the e - folding time of the acf . for @xmath27",
    ", we thus recover @xmath30 . in the following",
    ", we will study @xmath3 instead of @xmath1 to correctly account for slopes that differ from two .",
    "six teams have fitted the granulation background of the red giants and the values of the parameters have been compared to check the validity of the results .",
    "for all the methods explained below , except can , the fit is performed by not taking into account the frequency region in which the solar - like oscillations are present .",
    "can fits the p - mode bump together with the background .",
    "the methods are all summarized in tables  [ tbl-1 ] and [ tbl-1_1 ] .",
    "the oct method fits the background of the power density spectrum ( pds ) using one harvey - like model :    @xmath31    the initial input parameters are [ @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 = [ @xmath36 , 0.01 , 2 , noise ] , in which @xmath36 is the maximum power of the binned power spectrum ( bins vary with frequency and are 2@xmath37 wide ) , and noise is the minimum power of the binned power spectrum .",
    "all four parameters are left free in the non - linear least - squares fit .",
    "when 100 iterations are done , the model with the lowest @xmath38 is chosen .",
    "the standard deviations of the fitted parameters are used as the uncertainties .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the method adopted by syd ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) consists of fitting the background with two modified harvey functions @xcite :    @xmath39    with @xmath40 the root mean square ( rms ) intensity in power density .",
    "@xmath41 corresponds to the granulation time scale and @xmath42 might correspond to another feature with no physical meaning so far.this method uses a levenberg - markward least - squares algorithm to fit the background and to estimate @xmath40 and @xmath43 .",
    "the initial guess value for the granulation time scale is scaled from the sun using the relation @xmath44 , where @xmath4 is the frequency of maximum oscillation power and is determined before the background model is fitted . to stabilize the fit , only frequencies in the power spectrum lower than 2@xmath4",
    "are used for fitting the granulation component .",
    "this fit is performed on a binned pds , leading to a gaussian distribution of the points in the power spectrum .",
    "monte - carlo simulations are used to estimate uncertainties on the fitted parameters . for each simulation ,",
    "a synthetic spectrum is generated by drawing random values following a @xmath38 distribution with two degree of freedom ( d.o.f . ) and repeating the fitting procedure described above .",
    "the uncertainties are taken as the standard deviations of the distributions derived from typically 1000 simulations .",
    "the can method uses three harvey - like functions to model the stellar background signal and a gaussian to account for the additional power due to p - mode oscillations :    @xmath45    with the condition @xmath46 , where the indices indicate consecutive background components .",

    "kepler_. the results of each method listed above are shown and all of them",
    "provide the same qualitative results around the break of the granulation profile with small differences at very low frequency or at very high frequency .",
    "we note that one method can work well for one star while another method might work better for another star .",
    "figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show the results of @xmath3 and @xmath2 for the methods described in section 3.1 . for the methods where more than one harvey - like function was fitted , the one with the smallest time scale has been interpreted as belonging to the granulation for the syd method and the middle time scale was used for the can method .",
    "the trends in the results from different methods are consistent , although they are not always the same .",
    "interestingly the correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath2 as shown in figure  [ fig4 ] is more coherent for the different methods .",
    "this could indicate a degeneracy in the fitted parameters coming from the use of different methods with different free parameters , models , data , number of components as it can be seen in figure  [ fig0 ] .",
    "however for a given method , the results and the trends are consistent . for the different methods , the average uncertainties on 1/@xmath3 are 3% , 9% , 9% , 1% , and 6% for a2z , can , syd , oct , and cor respectively .",
    "some of these uncertainties ( in particular for a2z , oct and cor ) seem rather small and might be underestimated so we assume that the uncertainty should rather be around 10% . if we look at the dispersion between the methods for a given @xmath4 , 1/@xmath3 varies by @xmath0  30% around the average value . the dispersion between the stars",
    "can be related to the different metallicities of the stars .",
    "one thing that is apparent is the existence of a `` jump '' in the @xmath1 results at @xmath4  @xmath040  @xmath61hz for two of the methods using a single power law , an initial guess for @xmath1 independent of @xmath4 and @xmath25 as a free parameter .",
    "this second branch is most likely due to the fact that the fit converges to a second feature in the power spectrum .",
    "the absence of the second branch in the results of dlb ( guess of @xmath1 independent of @xmath4 but fixed @xmath25 ) indicates that the convergence is at least partly due to the fact that @xmath25 is a free parameter .",
    "we also performed tests with different initial guesses for @xmath1 ( again independent of @xmath4 ) and that reduces the second branch but the fit does not converge for high values of @xmath4 . additionally , to investigate further the number of components , we performed tests with one method , a2z in this case , in which we fitted either one or two harvey components with several initial parameters to investigate how these affect the results ( see the appendix for more details ) .",
    "it appears that by using two harvey - like functions , we obtain only one branch instead of two branches ( see discussion in section 6 ) . for all of these reasons",
    ", we think that on the one hand , the minimization algorithm of the fit could go to a local minimum instead of a global minimum , which can lead to the second branch . on the other hand",
    ", this second branch could be related to the initial guesses , for which we converge to a background component with lower @xmath1 , which is likely to be something different from granulation . from the fact that the second branch also shows a strong correlation with @xmath4",
    ", we expect it to be of stellar origin and it could correspond for instance to a phenomenon similar to bright points or stellar spots whose appearance is modulated by the stellar rotation .",
    "as the results of the methods are qualitatively similar , we use one method for the representations of our results in the remainder of this work .",
    "from some basic physical assumptions , it is possible to predict the behavior of granulation with respect to stellar parameters . as argued by @xcite and",
    ", the convection cells travel a vertical distance that is proportional to the pressure scale height , @xmath62 , at a speed that is approximately proportional to the sound speed , @xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the characteristic time scale of the granulation can be expressed as @xmath66 , where @xmath5 is surface gravity , @xmath6 is effective temperature , @xmath67 is stellar radius , and @xmath68 is stellar mass .",
    "this result indicates that we should expect longer characteristic granulation time scales on larger stars , i.e. stars with lower surface gravity .",
    "support for the argument is given by the 3d simulations by @xcite carried out with the @xcite code .",
    "these simulations indicate that red giants have granulation cells that are roughly 15  @xmath62 wide .",
    "the proportinality of the horizontal size of a granule , @xmath69 to the pressure scale height , @xmath62 , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implies the following : @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the linear size of the granules is inversely proportional to the gravity , and since @xmath6 and the mass of the star vary less than the radii of red giants , it indicates that the size of the granules should increase with the radius of the star .    for the number of granules on the surface , @xmath71 , we derive the following : @xmath72 .",
    "this indicates that the number of granulation cells decreases with increasing stellar radius or equivalently decreasing surface gravity .",
    "so , large stars have a relatively small number of large granulation cells on their surfaces compared to smaller stars with a relatively higher number of smaller cells .",
    "these results are in line with earlier work by e.g. @xcite .",
    "evidence for large granulation features has been observed on red supergiants such as betelgeuse using interferometry ( for a review see @xcite , for recent observations see and for their interpretation with 3d simulations , see ; @xcite ) . we can test this hypothesis here also for red giants .    as already pointed out by the original harvey models ,",
    "the power of the granulation @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath73 , @xmath24 being the rms intensity fluctuation .",
    "the proportionality with @xmath1 also means that @xmath74 , i.e. fewer larger cells result in higher granulation power , and thus each cell has a larger influence on the total luminosity fluctuations of the star , and hence a larger influence on its variability .",
    "this has some similarity with the oscillations , i.e. the amplitudes of oscillation modes also increase with lower @xmath4 .    in figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we fitted a power law for each parameter and for each method .",
    "the values of the slopes are listed in table  [ tbl-2 ] . by taking the results of all the methods together , we find that @xmath7 while @xmath8 , which is close to the relation derived above ( @xmath75 ) and with the relations obtained by ( @xmath76 )",
    ". finally , it also agrees with analytical models of convection where a coefficient @xmath77 is found for the @xmath1-@xmath4 relation ( r. samadi private communication ) .",
    "given that both p modes and granulation are driven by convection , this correlation is not surprising .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the variation of @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "the fit of a power law ( see table  [ tbl-2 ] ) gives a slope of 2.18 for all the methods together , which agrees with the scaling laws .",
    "it is interesting to study the variation of the ratio between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which is proportional to the variance of the intensity variations .",
    "this quantity varies as a function of log @xmath5 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig3 ] , where we used the granulation parameters obtained by a2z as an example , but this tendency is qualitatively similar for the other methods .",
    "stars that have smaller log @xmath5 , thus larger radii present a higher intensity contrast compared to stars with a higher log @xmath5 .",
    "this anti - correlation between @xmath78 and log @xmath5 seen in figure  [ fig3 ] is mostly due to the fact that @xmath2 scales with @xmath79 , which arises from the averaging of fluctuations over many ( unresolved ) granules , diminishing the power for large @xmath71 , i.e , having fewer granules leads to less averaging over the stellar surface and the effect on luminosity from each granule is higher .",
    "we investigate the dependence of the granulation parameters of the red - giant stars with stellar fundamental parameters r , m , @xmath6 , and lo @xmath5 .",
    "these parameters have been computed with the method described by using 13 months long time series for a sample of 1035 red giants .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows how @xmath3 computed with method can varies with @xmath67 , @xmath13 , @xmath68 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the results from the can method are shown here because this method provides results of a large sample of stars . as predicted from scaling relations ( see section 4.1 , @xmath80 ) for bigger stars ,",
    "the granulation time scales are larger and we can fit a power law showing the correlation between @xmath3 and r as @xmath81 .",
    "this is also consistent with the predicted anti - correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath13 .",
    "correlations of granulation parameters with mass and radius are not as tight as with @xmath82 , since the latter is the underlying independent variable ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the correlation with @xmath6 seems much less tight than with @xmath13 .",
    "however , the plot of @xmath3 vs. @xmath6 is dominated by stellar evolution effects and hence shows a similar behavior as seen in the h - r diagram ( figure  [ fig8 ] ) including the spread in points intrinsically linked to the distribution of stars in the h - r diagram .",
    "from the fact that @xmath83 , we would expect similar correlations for the granulation power .",
    "these are indeed observed and shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "we note a bump around 10@xmath84 , log @xmath5 = 2.5 and @xmath6 = 4700  k in figures  [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "it corresponds to the so - called red clump , corresponding to red giants that have gone through a helium flash and are now in their he - core burning phase . in the plot showing @xmath3 as a function of @xmath6 , we also clearly see the red - giant branch",
    ".      having a large number of red giants that are at different stages of their evolution allows us to study the distribution of the granulation parameters in this part of the h - r diagram .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig8 ] shows the distribution of @xmath85 in our sample of red giants . as previously ,",
    "the values of @xmath6 and @xmath86 have been computed as described by . for stars with increasing luminosity , @xmath85 decreases ,",
    "thus @xmath3 is larger , which also correlates with larger granulation cells .",
    "there is a large concentration of points at log@xmath87  1.7 .",
    "these stars belong to the red clump .",
    "the distribution of the granulation power , @xmath2 , is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "we note that low - luminosity stars have low @xmath2 values , which is once again similar to what we observe for the mode amplitudes .",
    "this is not surprising as the p modes are excited in the convection zone so the same order of magnitude of energy would be involved in both granulation and p - mode excitation .",
    "this is in agreement with the study of the height - to - background - ratio by @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite , @xcite , and detected for the first time mixed modes in the red giants .",
    "they showed that the period spacings between the mixed modes make it possible to distinguish between stars ascending the red - giant branch , i.e. , h - shell burning stars and stars in the red clump , i.e. , he - core burning stars . using this information",
    ", we investigated whether the stars show differences in granulation parameters related to their evolutionary phase .",
    "due to the uncertainties in the granulation parameters a firm conclusion can not yet been drawn , although some indications of different granulation parameters with evolutionary state are present .",
    "it is at least clear that the red - clump stars have granulation values in a specific range , and the red - giant branch stars have their values spread over a larger range .",
    "it is not surprising as the structure of red - clump stars is very similar , which would lead to similar granulation characteristics .",
    "to help us interpret the _ kepler _ observations , we have turned to 3d hydrodynamic simulations of convection in stellar surface layers .",
    "these simulations , described in more detail in @xcite , were constructed for direct comparison with observations and are therefore based on the state - of - the - art atomic physics .",
    "the thermodynamics is provided by tables of the so - called mhd equation of state ( eos ) @xcite , which is based on explicit accounting for all excited states in all ions of the 16 most abundant elements , and a physical model of the ( non - ideal ) effect of interactions between particles .",
    "the opacities are based on the marcs stellar atmosphere package @xcite , but with several updates of the opacity sources and line - opacities from the atlas stellar atmosphere package @xcite , as detailed in @xcite .",
    "the three main processes governing the surface layers ( i.e. , what we can observe ) of late type stars are hydrodynamics , thermodynamics and radiative transfer .",
    "these processes interact in very complicated ways , hence the need for realistic first - principles simulations .",
    "the surface layers ( by definition ) straddle the photospheric transition from the optically deep interior and the optically thin atmosphere , which means the radiative transfer can not be treated in any known approximation .",
    "the full wavelength and ray - direction dependent problem has to be considered and the simulations are based on the opacity binning formulation introduced by @xcite .",
    "the simulations are each performed on a grid of @xmath88 points , spanning about 13 pressure scale - heights in the vertical direction ( with 7 below the photosphere ) and reaching up to an optical depth of @xmath89 .",
    "the horizontal extent primarily scales with gravity , with only a slight increase with @xmath6 and is large enough to cover about 10 major granules .",
    "each simulation was relaxed to a statistically steady state , with no systematic drifts in fluxes or mean structure over time .",
    "surplus energy was extracted by artificially damping radial p modes during the relaxation .",
    "after this relaxation , production runs were carried out , covering at least 10 periods of the fundamental p mode .",
    "the resonant modes of the box ( the bottom is a node ) are excited and damped by the convection in the box and saturate at an amplitude given by the balance between the damping and driving . with these fairly short time - series ranging from 14h55 for the coolest subgiant to 5d 17h30 for the hottest giant , we see two to three radial modes and similar for the non - radial modes that has the box - width as horizontal wavelength .",
    "all 37 simulations of the grid were performed for solar metallicity as in @xcite with he and fe adjusted to mimick @xcite and cover the zero - age main - sequence from @xmath90300k to 6900k and up to giants of @xmath91 between @xmath92000k and 4200k .",
    "our sample of 1035 _ kepler _ red giants is spanned by seven of the 37 simulations of the grid . about 11% of the stars , however , fall outside the simulation grid and are therefore not included in the comparisons of section  [ sect : granchar ] .",
    "similar simulations that are not part of the grid , have been widely applied to solar and stellar observations .",
    "a study of solar fei and ii lines by @xcite showed remarkable agreement with the shape , asymmetry and wavelength - shift ( without adjustable parameters to match these profiles to the observations ) .",
    "note that 1d solar atmosphere models can not reproduce these observations .",
    "a similar analysis was carried out for procyon with a similar level of success .",
    "this agreement with detailed line - shapes , leads to a recognition of the nii blend with the [ o]i line , leading to agreement between the oxygen abundances from [ o]i and oi - lines @xcite .",
    "the center - to - limb variation of na- and o - lines in the sun also matches observations @xcite .",
    "even earlier simulations could reproduce the observed sizes , shapes and contrast of granules @xcite and @xcite showed how the stratification change from a realistic 3d convective atmosphere accounts for most of the so - called _ surface term _ in helioseismology . together , these disparate observational tests probe a large range of depths in the atmosphere of the simulation , giving us confidence that they are a better representation of stellar atmospheres than are 1d models . hence , the 3d simulations have a larger predictive power .      for each simulation",
    ", radiative transfer was performed for the full set of wavelengths in the opacity distribution functions ( odfs ) .",
    "the odfs that were used are defined for 1100 wavelength regions , with 12 points in each of these distribution functions .",
    "we have artificially assigned wavelengths to these 12 points within their respective wavelength regions , in a way that gives them the appropriate integration weight .",
    "the resulting spectra are saw - tooth shaped with 20 wide bins in the optical .",
    "this is obviously not adequate for monochromatic studies , but this wavelength re - ordering of opacity on a 20 - scale , has very little effect on broad - band colors .",
    "figure  [ figodf ] shows such an odf spectrum together with the _ kepler _ filter . having computed complete spectra for each snapshot of each simulation , and for eight @xmath61-angles ( @xmath93 of the position angle on the stellar disk ) and four azimuthal @xmath94-angles",
    ", we then proceeded to average over @xmath94 and convolve with the transmission curve of the _ kepler _ filter .",
    "this results in _ kepler _ intensities as function of @xmath61-angle and time , @xmath95 .",
    "the subsequent transformation from specific intensities , to power spectra of observable fluxes , was performed as described by @xcite and later described in great detail by @xcite . following the derivations of @xcite we write @xmath96    where @xmath97 is the horizontal extent of the simulation domain",
    ", @xmath98 is the fourier transform of @xmath99 , @xmath100 indicates the complex conjugate , @xmath67 is the radius of the star and @xmath101 is the number of simulation domains that fit over the visible half of the stellar surface .",
    "division by the _ kepler _ flux of the simulation , @xmath102 , provides for the relative power spectra of the flux in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpower ] ) .",
    "the weights , @xmath103 , and angles , @xmath104 , of the angular quadrature are chosen according to the method of @xcite , which gives an optimal set of quadrature points , with the vertical direction included .",
    "the @xmath94-angles that have index @xmath105 , are equidistant and therefore have weights @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath107 is the power of intensity in a particular direction , @xmath104 and @xmath108 .",
    "the power of the simulation domain is diluted by the factor @xmath101 to account for the averaging out of uncorrelated convective fluctuations from different parts of the stellar disk .",
    "the underlying assumption of this formulation is that patches on the stellar surface , more than the distance @xmath97 apart are uncorrelated .",
    "the simulations are dimensioned such that they each contain about a dozen major granules at any one time , and the assumption is therefore reasonable .",
    "the time series of the simulations are unfortunately not long enough to sub - divide the time series in order to perform ensemble averaging to reduce the noise .",
    "instead we performed a running gaussian smoothing of the power spectra and these are then fitted with a harvey - like model . in the fitting process",
    "we also allow for a white noise component , and the two strongest p modes . due to the rather short time",
    "series , these modes are very broad , and we fit them with gaussian profiles .",
    "only two or three modes are visible in each simulation , and they are constrained to have a node at the bottom of the simulation box , which means they do nt correspond to real eigenmodes of the star .",
    "their frequencies , however , are still within the p - mode bump of real stars .      having fitted the granulation power spectra of the simulations of the grid to the generalized harvey function of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we now have three granulation parameters as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath13 .",
    "for comparison with the red giants studied in this paper , we therefore interpolated these parameters between the simulations , to the red giants based on their atmospheric parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath13 .",
    "since the simulation grid is irregular , we used linear interpolation on a delaunay triangulation of the grid @xcite .",
    "top panels of figures  [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] show how @xmath3 of the simulations varies with @xmath6 and log @xmath5 .",
    "the simulations have the same trend as the observations .",
    "we observe very tight correlations between @xmath3 and log @xmath5 . in the correlation between the granulation parameters and @xmath6 ( figure  [ fig9 ] )",
    "the stellar evolution effects are again dominant ( see also section 4.2 ) and these figures show similar structure as seen in the h - r diagrams in figure  [ fig8 ] . for @xmath3 , the agreement between the observations and the simulations is better than a factor 2 .",
    "we also compared @xmath2 from the simulations and the observations ( bottom panels of figures  [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] ) and we note a discrepancy of an order of magnitude .",
    "for @xmath0  1000 red giants we studied 13 months of data obtained by the _ kepler",
    "_ mission .",
    "these data were processed in order to reduce the instrumental effects while keeping as much information as possible to preserve the granulation signal .    * six * teams fitted the power spectra with different methods based on a harvey model to estimate the granulation parameters .",
    "we first checked that the values obtained by the different methods were in general agreement .",
    "we notice that two branches appear for two of the methods that fitted only one harvey model . in these cases ,",
    "the methods are likely to fit for another feature present in the data .",
    "judging from the correlation of the second branch with @xmath4 , we think this signal could also be of stellar origin .",
    "the comparison of the results of the red giants with the values we have for the sun , suggests that the second branch would correspond to some high - frequency phenomena , such as bright points .",
    "we regard a further investigation of this matter beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we found that the granulation time scale is proportional to @xmath109 , while the granulation power is proportional to @xmath110 , which agrees with theoretical scaling laws . from these results ,",
    "we can use @xmath4 as an initial guess for @xmath1 to fit the background .",
    "we also showed that stars with larger radii have larger granules to the extent that their surfaces are covered by a smaller total number of granules .",
    "our study of the granulation power of red giants shows that larger stars present larger intensity fluctuations .",
    "part of the reason for this is the smaller total number of granules covering the surface of larger stars , and hence less averaging out of fluctuations , compared to a star with many more ( unresolved ) granules .",
    "we also found that stars in the red clump have very similar values of granulation parameters .    finally , we compared 3d simulations with our red giants sample and the granulation time scale is consistent with the observations in terms of trend with less than a factor of 2 difference .",
    "the fact that for the observations and simulations , we have some dispersion in the plot @xmath3 vs. log @xmath5 can be due to several factors : 1 ) different stars having different metallicity ( while our simulations have solar metallicity ) , 2 ) the instrumental noise that might have not been completely removed after the data processing , and 3 ) the radius is not necessarily determined with a sufficient accuracy for the interpolation of the simulations .",
    "the magnetic activity can also have an impact and could change the estimation of the granulation time scale by some factor , leading to different values of @xmath3 for stars that have similar @xmath4 .",

    "we did a few tests with one of the methods used in this work ( namely a2z ) to investigate the impact of the initial guess of the slope , @xmath25 , for the following values : [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] on six different red giants , ranging in @xmath4 between 40 and 100  @xmath61hz .",
    "to quantitatively compare the fits , we computed @xmath38 values as the mean value of the difference between the background fit and the heavily smoothed pds .",
    "the best fits for the stars with @xmath111 40  @xmath61hz were obtained for a slope of 2 and 3 , with @xmath38 values ranging from 0.7 to 3.7 , while for other values ( 1 , 4 , and 5 ) , we could not reproduce the knee of the harvey model and obtained only a straight line with a slope ( see figure  [ fig11 ] ) . for stars with @xmath112 40  @xmath61hz , the best fit is found for an initial guess of 3 , 4 , and 5 for the slope with @xmath38 values around 0.2 .",
    "we also noticed that by fixing the value of the white noise parameter the results were the same except in the case of a slope lower than 3 .",
    "it seems that by assuming a slope too large and by adding a constrain on the white noise component , the background fit becomes less reliable .",
    "then we added a gaussian to the fit to incorporate the p - mode bump .",
    "these values were close to the ones obtained by not taking into account the bump of the oscillation modes .",
    "we also checked how the fit converged when we decreased the initial guess of 1/@xmath1 to 10  @xmath61hz .",
    "though the code does not converge for high values of @xmath4 , the second branch starts to disappear for @xmath113hz .",
    "we fitted two harvey - like models using different initial values for time scale of the second harvey model : 2 , 5 , 10 and 15  @xmath61hz .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath4 , the code could converge or not .",
    "for all the stars , a result for the fit could be obtained when the time scale value of the second model was 5 or 2  @xmath61hz . for these stars , the @xmath38 between the fit and the pds is smaller when the guess of the first slope is smaller than 3 and when we do not fix the value of the white noise parameter ( around 3.6 compared to 7.5 ) .",
    "we compared the dispersion of the values of @xmath3 and of @xmath2 with the uncertainties for the fits that reproduced the knee of the granulation and found that the dispersion is related to the way we fit the background .",
    "depending on the initial guess of 1/@xmath1 , we find that @xmath3 and @xmath2 vary by @xmath0  5% around the value found by the reference fit .",
    "the uncertainties on these values are a @xmath0  6 - 10% around the value found by the reference fit .",
    "we conclude that the dispersion of these parameters with the initial guess of 1/@xmath1 is of the same order of magnitude as the uncertainty .",
    "we also performed some tests on 700 red giants by fitting two harvey - like models without the white noise component and with a guess for the second @xmath17 of 300  @xmath61hz .",
    "for these tests , a triangular smooth over 30 days was used to have enough points for the second harvey like model . in figure",
    "[ fig12 ] , we can notice that for these cases , @xmath3 is larger compared to the case where we use only one harvey model .",
    "as we fit two harvey - like models , the code compensates the presence of the second component by increasing the value of @xmath3 . beside",
    "we find the same value of @xmath114 in the relation @xmath3=@xmath115 whether we fit one or two harvey - like function while the second branch below 40  @xmath61hz starts to disappear and to merge with the first one when we fit two harvey - like functions .",
    "finally , we checked that the granulation signature in the pds was not a result of observing some harmonics of the p - mode bump .",
    "we removed the p modes from the pds by applying a pre - whitening and fitted the background with oct .",
    "we obtained the same values for the granulation characteristics confirming that there was no reflection effect .                 .",
    "the `` lines '' seen in this spectrum are therefore not actual spectral lines , but 1100 `` giant '' lines , each quantifying the distribution of opacity in the wavelength interval of each line ( of about 20 in the optical ) .",

    "<S> the granulation pattern that we observe on the surface of the sun is due to hot plasma from the interior rising to the photosphere where it cools down , and descends back into the interior at the edges of granules . </S>",
    "<S> this is the visible manifestation of convection taking place in the outer part of the solar convection zone . </S>",
    "<S> because red giants have deeper convection zones and more extended atmospheres than the sun , we can not a priori assume that granulation in red giants is a scaled version of solar granulation . </S>",
    "<S> until now , neither observations nor 1d analytical convection models could put constraints on granulation in red giants . </S>",
    "<S> however , thanks to asteroseismology , this study can now be performed . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting parameters yield physical information about the granulation . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze @xmath0  1000 red giants that have been observed by _ kepler _ during 13 months . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the power spectra with harvey - like profiles to retrieve the characteristics of the granulation ( time scale @xmath1 and power @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce a new time scale , @xmath3 , which takes into account that different slopes are used in the harvey functions . </S>",
    "<S> we search for a correlation between these parameters and the global acoustic - mode parameter ( the position of maximum power , @xmath4 ) as well as with stellar parameters ( mass , radius , surface gravity ( log @xmath5 ) and effective temperature ( @xmath6 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which is consistent with the theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the granulation time scales of stars that belong to the red clump have similar values while the time scales of stars in the red - giant branch are spread in a wider range . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that realistic 3d simulations of the surface convection in stars , spanning the ( @xmath6 , log @xmath5)-range of our sample of red giants , match the _ kepler _ observations well in terms of trends . </S>"
