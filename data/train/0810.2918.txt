    "superradiance from a bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) offers the possibility to study the novel physics associated with cooperative scattering of light in ultracold atomic systems .",
    "a series of experiments  @xcite and related theories  @xcite have sparked the related interest in the quantum information  @xcite , collective instability  @xcite , high precision measurement  @xcite , and coherent atom optics  @xcite .    in a typical bec superradiant",
    "experiment , the pattern of recoiling atoms by absorption image method reflects the atomic momentum spectroscopy or momentum distribution  @xcite , where the moving atoms and the static bec form a matter wave grating . at the same time , the scattering optical spectroscopy shows the gain process with time  @xcite . to enhance the scattering light signal ,",
    "the optical cavity is applied in the similar experimental setting which usually called collective atomic recoil lasing ( carl )  @xcite , where the atoms are forced to maintain in the density grating by the optical lattice in the cavity .",
    "different from the above case , here we consider the scattering superradiance from an array of becs .",
    "optical lattices ( ol ) , created by pairs of off - resonance counter - propagating laser beams , offer new opportunities to investigate quantum information processing and strongly correlated quantum matter  @xcite .",
    "the periodical potential in an optical lattice forms an atomic density grating , hence to study the superradiance in this array the coherence of atom both inner site and between sites need to be considered .",
    "therefore superradiance has the potential to become a method to detect the coherence of atoms in an optical potential .",
    "this is different from the interaction of light and bec in an ol trap without the atoms recoiling  @xcite , where the inter sites atomic coherence was considered and the inner site coherence is neglected .    to study the superradiance in an optical lattice , there are several problems to be considered with regard to the theory about the superradiance from bec  @xcite .",
    "first the frequency of optical lattice , usually several @xmath0 , is much larger than that of the magnetic trap ( tens to hundreds @xmath1 ) where the effects of trap is usually neglected for its frequency is much smaller than the recoil frequency .",
    "secondly , we need to calculate the gain in the special emission angle . in the case of a magnetic trap , the atomic cloud experiences the maximum gain when the mode is along its long axis . and",
    "it can also be understood by that the direction is selected for the least width of momentum to get the maximum gain  @xcite . the long axis and the least width of momentum , these two directions are the same in a magnetic trap , but not necessarily true in an ol trap .",
    "lastly but important , since the light scattering depends on the coherence of different sites , the interference of scattered light results in amplification at some specific frequency and suppression at the others",
    ". it could provide us a method to obtain the information of the atoms in ol . the density grating formed by optical lattice and the grating formed by moving and static atoms give two criterions for the optical amplification .",
    "hence , similar to the coherent - enhanced imaging where raman superradiance is used to probe the spatial coherence of bec in a magnetic trap  @xcite , the scattering spectroscopy reflects the cooperative radiation of atoms inner - site and inter - sites .",
    "-axis , with m sites . the pumping laser is propagating along @xmath2-axis . and in the @xmath3 plain , the length in the @xmath4-direction is bigger than that in the @xmath5-direction . , width=226 ]    we consider the model that the atomic cloud is prepared in an optical lattice , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the optical lattice is placed along the @xmath5-axis with @xmath6-sites centered at origin .",
    "the lattice constant is @xmath7 , the length of condensate is @xmath8 , and the pumping laser incident with wave vector @xmath9 propagates along its short axis @xmath2 .    in order to investigate the superradiant gain",
    ", we adiabatically eliminate the excited state for the far - off resonant pump laser and use the rotating wave approximation .",
    "therefore the effective hamiltonian about the coupling between the atomic and electromagnetic fields can be written as  @xcite @xmath10 where the @xmath11\\hat\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$ ] is the atomic hamiltonian , for the classical potential of ol is @xmath12 with the lattice depth @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the hamiltonian of photon , and the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is atomic field operator , and @xmath17 is the annihilation operator for a photon in mode @xmath18 in the frame rotating at the pump frequency @xmath19 . here the photon energy @xmath20 the operator @xmath21 refers to the recoiling atom wave function which scatters the @xmath22 mode light , @xmath23 is the ground - state wave - function of the condensate with the chemical potential @xmath24 . when the ol potential is weak enough",
    ", we could deal this case as in a magnetic trap@xcite . and",
    "when it is extremely strong , we are able to approximate the potential as the spatial replication of harmonic trap @xmath25 , then decompose the operator to the eigenstate of the trap that @xmath26 and we define the coefficient @xmath27 @xmath28 is the eigenfunction of @xmath29-th level of the trap , and the @xmath30 is the poission distribution with parameter @xmath31 , here @xmath32 is the recoiling frequency .",
    "considering the first - order side modes , then the interaction hamiltonian becomes @xmath33,\\ ] ] with @xmath34\\ ] ] is the fourier transform of the ground state density distribution centered at @xmath35 .",
    "as the experiment shows that there are just several side modes dominate the whole scattering process , and in order to simplify this problem , we just take one side mode @xmath36 into consideration . under the born - markov approximation , the optical field",
    "could be obtained that @xmath37 inserting ( [ bevo ] ) into the dynamic equation of atomic field , @xmath38/i\\hbar$ ] , we obtain its evolution equation @xmath39 with the bec s gain with the @xmath36-th mode as @xmath40 where we assumed that @xmath41 is isotropic in the @xmath42 plane . the first term on the _ r.h.s . _ of eq.([cqevo ] )",
    "is the gain from the condensate .",
    "the second term is the quantum fluctuation , which has been discussed in @xcite and does not affect the superradiant behavior in long time , and we just take it as an initial seed .",
    "the last term on the _ r.h.s .",
    "( [ cqevo ] ) is the energy term .    in order to compare the two cases of pumping the condensate with and without the external potential , we need to discuss equation ( [ cqevo ] ) by the mean - field approximation , replacing the field operator @xmath43 by a c - number @xmath44 . by transformation @xmath45 ,",
    "the equation ( [ cqevo ] ) becomes @xmath46 for the case that potential is turned off when pumping the condensate by the laser , we assume that there is just only one level @xmath29 satisfying the condition @xmath47 , with eigenenergy @xmath48 , and for the else @xmath49 . thus on the _ r.h.s .",
    "_ of the equation ( [ cpevo ] ) the phase factor @xmath50 is always equal to one . and this form is consistent with the equation ( 8) in  @xcite .",
    "the gain of atomic number is therefore @xmath51 . for the case",
    "that the external potential exists , the parameters @xmath52 are centered at @xmath53 and have a standard deviation @xmath54 , and we just need to consider these @xmath55 trap levels that make @xmath56 . and",
    "the phase factor @xmath50 is different for different levels .",
    "these factors could be approximated by calculating the average phase difference @xmath57 in a during time @xmath58 .",
    "thus the different phases in different levels lead to that the sum in the _ r.h.s .",
    "_ of equation ( [ cpevo ] ) is smaller than the case that they are the same phase , in the previous case .",
    "this results in the gain loss , given by @xmath59    a typical value of the gain is @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which is close to the frequency of the atom in the optical lattice trap .",
    "thus when the @xmath63 is large enough to dephase the coherence of condensate and side mode , the gain of light is suppressed .",
    "since the effect of the trap is just a shift in the gain , in the below we mainly discuss the gain without the trap @xmath51 .",
    "now we consider the case that the pump beam immediately incidents after switching off the potential , so the external trapping potential could be neglected .",
    "the wave function of ground state for the @xmath64-th site is the wannier function @xmath65 , which is approximated by the gaussian function @xmath66 with the half width of the wave function @xmath67 in @xmath68 direction @xmath69 .",
    "thus the ground - state wave - function in the optical lattice is given by @xmath70 , where the @xmath71 is the normalization factor .",
    "for one site , we assume @xmath72 , the maximum gain is the @xmath4 direction because the photon could experience the most atomic amplification  @xcite . here , we need to carefully discuss the gain for the whole atomic cloud .",
    "since the @xmath6 sites are placed along @xmath5-axis and centered at origin with lattice spacing @xmath73 , then the atomic density can be expressed as @xmath74,\\ ] ] where the first term on the _ r.h.s .",
    "_ describes the atomic density of site @xmath64 .",
    "the second term is the overlapping between neighboring sites , which is considered only when the wavefunction of one site is wide enough to overlap its neighbors .",
    "the fourier transformation of the density at @xmath75 is @xmath76.\\ ] ]    , and in dash dotted line for @xmath77.,width=302 ]    we proceed to calculate the superradiant gain in ( [ gq ] ) .",
    "the factor in @xmath78 , @xmath79 , as shown in solid line of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] gives the density profile a sampling , which means that the @xmath78 is not zero in regions with half width @xmath80 and these regions separating @xmath81 from each other .",
    "moreover , the factor of @xmath82 , @xmath83 , is centered at @xmath84 and spreads in @xmath85 direction , which is significant in the region @xmath86 .",
    "the gaussian factor of @xmath78 is the dashed and dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , which shows that it is wider when the width in the single site wave function is smaller .",
    "we assume that @xmath87 , @xmath88 , which means that the atomic momentum is narrow enough that all its components could contribute to the optical amplification  @xcite . and in the region of @xmath78 where the gaussian factor is significant",
    ", we can approximate the surface of the sphere @xmath89 as a plane tangent to the sphere , and the integral in ( [ gq ] ) is equivalent to be the integral on this plane .",
    "so the integral when @xmath90 , where @xmath91 , is a unit direction in the @xmath42 plane .",
    "here we mainly consider the maximum gain of light in two extreme directions , @xmath92 corresponding to the @xmath4 direction , and @xmath93 for @xmath5 direction . for @xmath93 ,",
    "the gain is @xmath94 where @xmath95,\\ ] ] is related to the normalization factor @xmath96 , the width in @xmath2-direction @xmath97 and the factor @xmath98 $ ] which reflects the coherence of neighboring sites .",
    "eq.([gx ] ) shows that the gain @xmath99 is proportional to the number of site squared @xmath100 , which is the result of cooperative radiation .    because the non - zero region of @xmath101-function in ( [ gq ] ) is a plane parallel to the @xmath102 plane when @xmath103 , the profile width of @xmath104 will affect the result of @xmath105 .",
    "hence , we need to discuss two condition @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "for the case that @xmath106 , @xmath108 has @xmath109 side bands , after summing all these side bands whose half width is @xmath110 , we get the superradiant gain given by @xmath111 for the case that @xmath112 , there is just one non - zero region of @xmath78 , thus , the superradiant gain is @xmath113 in both cases , the gain @xmath114 is proportional to @xmath6 , due to the incoherent sum of different sites .    when @xmath106 , the gain ratio for the two extreme direction is that @xmath115 which is the aspect ratio , consistent with the theory without ol trap . when @xmath116 , the gain ratio becomes @xmath117 which is the effective length ratio in this two directions .",
    "it should be noted that this theory is sound under the condition that @xmath118 .",
    "a typical value is @xmath119 , hence @xmath120 .",
    "if we need the gain in @xmath4 direction larger than that in @xmath5 direction , we need @xmath121 , which is hard to be realized in experiment .",
    "thus the radiation usually takes place in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "in the previous section , we understand that the gain of light is usually propagating along the @xmath5-axis . considering @xmath122 in the @xmath5-direction , for the different @xmath22",
    "the gain can be expressed as @xmath123\\frac{\\sin^{2 }    \\frac{ma_0(k_0+q)}{2}}{\\sin^{2}\\frac{a_0(k_0+q)}{2}}.\\ ] ]    in this equation , we know that the maximum gains emerge at @xmath124 . in other words ,",
    "the gain has maximum around @xmath125 with separation @xmath81 .    , in @xmath5 direction for the @xmath126 ( a ) and @xmath127 ( b ) .",
    "the gain has satellites when the width of single site wave function is large . when it is narrow , the satellites disappear . here ,",
    "@xmath128.,width=264 ]    the spectroscopy of different width of single site wave function is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . as shown in subfigure ( a ) , when @xmath112 , there is only one peak in the gain .",
    "subfigure ( b ) shows that when the @xmath129 , there are side bands .",
    "the radiant light has side bands when the wave functions of neighboring sites are not overlapped .",
    "the reason is that atoms in different sites are pumping by the same phase light and become to the same phase dipole .",
    "the radiant light which is propagating along the lattice has a phase difference in neighboring sites , @xmath130 .",
    "thus radiant lights with different frequencies will have different gains by the averaging over the whole lattice .",
    "the constructive interference will single out the frequency component satisfying the condition @xmath131 to amplify , and other components will be suppressed due to the destructive interference of @xmath6 sites .",
    "direction versus the one site wave packet width . here ,",
    "@xmath128.,width=264 ]    for the larger width of single site wave function , the gain of side bands is smaller .",
    "thus by measuring the side band gain could give us a method to obtain the information about the width @xmath132 .",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows the ratio of maximum gain to the second maximum gain versus @xmath132 . by the spectroscopical measuring",
    ", we could obtain the information of the width of wave packet , which is relevant to the potential quantum phase transition .",
    "in the bec superradiant experiment  @xcite , a photon is scattered by one atom in the bec , and this atom acquires the recoil momentum . the moving atoms and the static bec form a matter wave grating , which enhances the same direction scattering . due to the mode competition , the highly directional emissions of light travel along the long axis of the condensate .",
    "the stability of the relative phase between different atomic matter waves determines the coherence time of the matter wave . on the other hand , in the coherent atomic recoil lasing ( carl )",
    ", the situation is changed by the presence of the cavity , the coherence is preserved as the relative phase of the cavity light - fields , and it is independent of the atomic motion while given by the cavity linewidth .",
    "different to these experimental scheme , here we extend the theory of superradiance of bec  @xcite to the case of in ol trap . in this trap ,",
    "an array of atoms from the optical lattice form a density grating , and the superradiance gain are calculated in the quantum theory . in this theory , we consider inner - site and inter - site coherence of atoms .",
    "only the scattering light satisfy the condition that @xmath133 will be singled out to be amplified and the other components will be suppressed in different extent .",
    "together with the grating formed by the static and moving condensate , both gratings give frequency selection rules .",
    "it is similar to a diode laser with internal and external cavities .",
    "only the light is resonant to both cavities will be amplified .",
    "the motion of recoiling atom in the high - frequency ol trap will dissipate the coherence resulting in a loss of the optical gain proportional to @xmath134 . in the magnetic trap ,",
    "the trap frequency is smaller , and the loss can be neglected .",
    "it can inhibit the collective radiation when the trap frequency is high enough . by calculating the ratio of optical gain in the two extreme direction",
    ", we show that the gain is proportional to the length that the light travels in the condensate .    depending on the lattice depth , the wave function for one site overlap differently with its neighboring sites .",
    "when the ol potential is low enough , the wave functions of neighboring sites fully overlap , just like a condensate in the magnetic trap . when the ol potential is high enough ,",
    "the wave functions of neighboring sites are separated .",
    "the different overlap results in the different scattering spectroscopy .",
    "thus the spectroscopy provides us with a new method to detect the coherence of different sites .",
    "this spectroscopy method offers much more precision than the absorption image method .",
    "moreover , unlike the time - of - flight method , which is usually used to detect quantum phase transition  @xcite , the spectroscopy method is a non - destructive method .",
    "more understanding of this mechanism can help to understand the self - organization , especially how the long - range order arise in the self - synchronization process .",
