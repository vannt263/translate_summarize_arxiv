    "<S> the particles are injected into the leftmost lattice site with the probability @xmath0 if the target site is empty . </S>",
    "<S> they are also extracted from the rightmost lattice site with the probability @xmath1 if it is already occupied . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that in the bulk of the lattice a particle at a given site @xmath2 deterministically move to the site @xmath3 provided that it is not occupied by other particles , which means that double occupation is prohibited . </S>",
    "<S> + in this paper we consider the asep with open boundaries in the sublattice - parallel update @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we are looking for a two - dimensional walk model which shares similar critical properties with the asep . </S>",

    "<S> the density of particles on the lattice have exponential behaviors while on the coexistence line it is linear because of considering a superposition of shocks with unbiased random walk dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> + in @xcite the author has rigorously shown that the steady - state of the asep in a sublattice - parallel update can be obtained using a matrix product method recently reviewed in @xcite . according to this method </S>",

    "<S> the random walker never takes two consecutive steps in the ne direction along the path ; however , it can take two consecutive steps in the se direction only once during the journey . in this case the random walker moves along a path which crosses the horizontal axis only once . </S>",

    "<S> the fugacity @xmath21 to all other steps .    in order to find the weight of a given path one can simply multiply the fugacities of different steps of the path . the partition function of this system can be easily calculated and one finds : @xmath62 in which : @xmath63 the first term in ( [ z3 ] ) does not play any important role in the critical behavior of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the second term in ( [ z3 ] ) , which is given explicitly in ( [ z4 ] ) , can be reinterpreted as the partition function of a two - dimensional walk model on a diagonally rotated square lattice ; however , one should assign the fugacities to the contact points ( instead of the steps ) in a different way . </S>",
    "<S> we assign a fugacity @xmath64 to each contact point @xmath57 for an even @xmath2 and a fugacity @xmath65 to each contact point @xmath57 for an odd @xmath2 if the contact point is above the horizontal axis . </S>",
    "<S> we also assign a fugacity @xmath66 to each contact point @xmath57 for an even @xmath2 and a fugacity @xmath67 to each contact point @xmath57 for an odd @xmath2 if the contact point is below the horizontal axis . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> we do not assign any fugacity to the contact points with the horizontal axis if they come from the first upward step or the first downward step . </S>",

    "<S> the only nonzero matrix elements are : @xmath80 all other matrix elements are zero . now using ( [ trans ] ) </S>",
    "<S> one can easily construct the transfer matrices in the above mentioned basis : @xmath81 and the vectors @xmath82 and @xmath83 are : @xmath84 before going any farther let us investigate the asymptotic behavior of the partition function of the one - transit walk model given in ( [ z4 ] ) in the large-@xmath85 limit . </S>",
    "<S> it can be easily seen that in the large-@xmath85 limit the partition function shows two different behaviors depending on whether @xmath86 or @xmath87 which results in two different phases . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the phase diagram of the walk model depends only on @xmath88 and @xmath89 and not the four independent fugacities . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that for the case @xmath86 most of the contacts with the horizontal axis will be from below while in the case @xmath87 they will be from above . on the coexistence line where @xmath90 the number of contacts both from above and below the horizontal axis will vary linearly along the horizontal axis . </S>",
    "<S> + at this point we show that how the partition function of the walk model ( [ z4 ] ) is related to that of the asep given in ( [ z1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it will also leads us to understand how the physical quantities in these systems are related . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that : @xmath91 now the following similarity transformation connects the two above mentioned systems : @xmath92 in which : @xmath93 it is also necessary to have the following relations : @xmath94 provided that @xmath95 and @xmath96 satisfy ( [ conditions1 ] ) which is achievable since @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are free to be chosen . </S>",
    "<S> it is now easy to check that the partition functions of the two systems in different descriptions given by ( [ z1 ] ) , ( [ z2 ] ) and ( [ z4 ] ) are equal . </S>",
    "<S> + let us now investigate how the physical quantities in the walk model are related to those in the asep . </S>",
    "<S> we start with the probability of finding a contact at the lattice site @xmath57 for an even @xmath2 from above @xmath100 or below @xmath101 the horizontal axis which is given by the following expressions : @xmath102 in which @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the contact operators at the lattice site @xmath57 from above and below the horizontal axis , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> using the matrix representations ( [ rep1 ] ) and ( [ rep2 ] ) , it is easy to calculate the expressions ( [ contacts1 ] ) and ( [ contacts2 ] ) analytically . + one can also calculate the probability of finding a contact at the lattice site @xmath57 for an odd @xmath2 from above @xmath105 or below @xmath106 the horizontal axis which is given by the following expressions : @xmath107 the contact operators @xmath108 and @xmath109 have the same definitions mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> + now we show that how the density of the particles in the asep is related to the probabilities of contacts given in ( [ contacts1])-([contacts4 ] ) . according to the matrix product formalism the density of the particles in an even site @xmath110 ( @xmath2 even ) in the asep in the sublattice - parallel update </S>",
    "<S> is given by : @xmath111 using ( [ st ] ) , ( [ contacts1 ] ) and ( [ contacts2 ] ) and after some straightforward calculations it turns out that ( [ evenden ] ) can be written as : @xmath112 on the other hand , in the same system and using the matrix product formalism the density of the particles in an odd site @xmath110 ( @xmath2 odd ) is given by : @xmath113 using ( [ st ] ) , ( [ contacts3 ] ) and ( [ contacts4 ] ) it is not difficult to show that ( [ oddden ] ) can be written as : @xmath114 in @xcite the authors have already studied both the phase diagram and also the behaviors of ( [ deneven ] ) and ( [ denodd ] ) in the large-@xmath85 limit ; therefore , we do not repeat their results here and the reader can directly refer to those references . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a description of the phase diagram of the same system based on the traveling shocks has been done in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in this paper we aimed to show that the steady - state of the asep with open boundaries in a sublattice - parallel update can be described using a two - dimensional walk model . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that the partition functions of these models are equal by properly defining the fugacities assigned to the steps ( or the contact points ) of the random walker . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the probability of finding a particles at a given lattice site in the asep is connected to the probability that the dyck path touches the horizontal axis at that point . </S>",
