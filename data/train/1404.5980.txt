    "the classical theory of force - free motions of rigid particle systems has a long history in connection with investigation in mathematics and mechanics . from the differential calculus , in the case of translational particle motions in euclidean space ( newton axioms of mechanics ) , to the riemann geometry .",
    "hence , the definition of geodesics has immediately concerned with force - free particle motions on surfaces .",
    "the introduction of riemannian manifolds and the geometry of their geodesics were motivated by the mechanics of constrained particle systems . in the last few years",
    ", the study of force - free motion systems on riemannian manifolds of constant sectional curvature has attracted the interest of several authors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in particular ,",
    "in @xcite the authors define the notion of a pendulum on a surface of constant gaussian curvature @xmath0 and they study the motion of a mass at a fixed distance from a pivot .",
    "so , a pendulum problem on a surface of constant curvature is defined as a pivot point and a mass connected to that point by a rigid massless rod of fixed length @xmath1 .",
    "it is assumed that the pivot is constrained to move along some fixed curve with prescribed motion .",
    "the rod provides the only force on the mass in order to keep the mass at the fixed distance from the pivot .",
    "no torque is applied to the rod , ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in @xcite",
    "it is studied the pendulum problem when the pivot moves along a geodesic path , and the space is a surface of constant ( not zero ) curvature .",
    "it is considered the surface immersed in @xmath2 or @xmath3 and it is obtained the differential motion equation by newtonian procedure doing a laborious calculation . moreover , the cases @xmath4 and @xmath5 are necessary to come from different forms .    in this work",
    ", we deal with the pendulum problem from an analytic point of view .",
    "this procedure allows approach simultaneously the cases of positive and negative curvature and also of zero curvature ( as a limit case ) , with very simple computations .",
    "the key of our study is a lagragian approach , which has a 1-dimensional configuration space .",
    "as adirect consequence the internal curvature force is conservative and its potential function is easily calculated .",
    "moreover , this method can be used to another related problems , as the elastic pendulum , or the quantum pendulum .",
    "mainly , this work concerns the case in which the pivot moves along a geodesic .",
    "let @xmath6 be the angle between the rod and the motion direction of the pivot .",
    "we will assume the following convention :    if the constant curvature of the space is @xmath4 ,    @xmath7    if the constant curvature of the space is @xmath5 ,    @xmath8    the main result is the following :    using the previous result and geometric arguments , we obtain the motion equation of the system when the pivot accelerates along a geodesic ( see section 4 ) .",
    "further developements are discussed in section 5 .",
    "it is well known that a complete , simply - connected riemannian @xmath9-manifold with constant sectional curvature is isometric to one of model spaces @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath12 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath13 be the 2-dimensional sphere of radius @xmath14 , endowed with the metric induced from @xmath15 , where @xmath16    consider the coordinate system @xmath17 in @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , being    @xmath21    in this coordinate system the metric is given by @xmath22    and the non - zero christoffel symbols are @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "let s consider also the hyperbolic plane @xmath25 , where @xmath26    and @xmath27 is the induced metric from the lorentz - minkowski spacetime @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath28 be the coordinate system in @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where    @xmath32    the metric is given by    @xmath33    and the non - zero christoffel symbols are @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "firstly , we deal with the rigid pendulum problem in the case that the pivot moves along a geodesic of its space , with constant speed . we will do analogously the study for @xmath4 and @xmath5 .      note that in the case @xmath4 we must require that @xmath36 to guarantee that the mass and the rod are on the same side of the geodesic line .",
    "suppose that the pivot moves along the geodesic @xmath37 with constant speed .",
    "let s take a reference associated to the pivot .",
    "denote by @xmath6 the angle between the rigid rod and the direction of pivot motion .",
    "the lagrangian of the system has two components , on the one hand , the kinetic energy of the mass @xmath38 , and on the other hand , the potential energy @xmath39 , which is due to the curvature of space , i.e. , @xmath40 if the space is flat .",
    "consider the isosceles geodesic triangle formed in an infinitesimal temporal interval , by the rod and the arc @xmath41 traced by the mass ( fig .",
    "2 ) .",
    "the sine theorem for spherical geometry allows us to write @xmath42    thus @xmath43    therefore , if the particle has mass @xmath44 , the kinetic energy is given by    @xmath45      consider the coordinate system @xmath17 with the metric @xmath46 and suppose that the pivot moves along the geodesic @xmath37 with constant speed @xmath47 . obtain us the mass acceleration due to the curvature , so suppose that the mass moves along the curve    @xmath48    its acceleration is given by @xmath49    as consequence , the external force that we must be to apply on the rod will be @xmath50 and the curvature potential energy @xmath39 satisfies @xmath51 , where @xmath52 . hence ,    @xmath53    where we have taken @xmath54 as origin energy . again , using the sine theorem ( fig .",
    "3 ) we obtain        @xmath55    thus    @xmath56    now , we can enunciate the following theorem ,    suppose that the pivot of pendulum moves with constant speed @xmath47 along a geodesic on a surface with constant curvature @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath57 the angle at the time @xmath58 between the rigid rod and the direction of pivot motion .",
    "then the lagrangian of the system is    @xmath59    therefore , the motion differential equation is given by    @xmath60    if we do @xmath61 , @xmath62    and    @xmath63    obtaining the lagrangian function of the pendulum moving in the euclidean plane , when the pivot moves along a straigh line with constant speed .",
    "consider us now , the pivot moving along the geodesic @xmath64 , with constant speed @xmath47 .",
    "analogously to the spherical case , we take a reference joint with the pivot and we denote @xmath6 the angle between the rigid rod and the direction of pivot motion .    if we consider the isosceles hyperbolic differential triangle ( fig .",
    "2 ) , and making use of the corresponding theorems of the hyperbolic geometry , we can to conclude that the kinetic energy of the system is given by    @xmath65      reasoning as the in spherical case , we consider that the pivot moves along the geodesic @xmath64 . if the mass moves along the curve    @xmath66    we can to calculate the curvature potential function ,    @xmath67    where we have taken @xmath68 as origin energy . again , using the sine theorem in the hyperbolic case , we obtain @xmath69    thus ,    @xmath70    suppose that the pivot of the pendulum moves with constant speed @xmath47 along a geodesic on a surface with constant curvature @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath57 the angle at the time @xmath58 between the rigid rod and the direction of pivot motion .",
    "then the lagrangian of the system is given by    @xmath71    therefore , the motion differential equation is    @xmath72    with our convention , we can to enunciate ( compare with @xcite , theorem a ) :    suppose that the pivot of pendulum moves with constant speed @xmath47 along a geodesic on a surface with constant curvature @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath57 the angle at the time @xmath58 between the rigid rod and the direction of pivot motion .",
    "then the lagrangian of the system is given by @xmath73    therefore , the motion differential equation is    @xmath74    suppose @xmath4 and consider the motion equation ( [ motion1 ] ) . making the change @xmath75 , we obtain the differential equation    @xmath76    which is the equation of planar pendulum of length @xmath77 in euclidean space subject to a constant gravitational field of magnitude @xmath78 .",
    "its stable and unstable equilibria at @xmath79 and @xmath80 , correspond to the stable @xmath81 and unstable @xmath82 equilibria of the pendulum on the spherical surface .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath5 , making @xmath83 in the motion equation ( [ motion ] ) , we obtain , in similar form , that @xmath82 is stable equilibria and @xmath81 is unstable equilibria .",
    "moreover , it is well known that the equation ( [ planar ] ) can be exactly solved in term of a elliptic integral of first kind ( see @xcite , for instance ) , which can not be evaluated in a closed form .    a first approximation to this problem in arbitrary constant curvature is given for small oscillations around the stable equilibria points of this physical system .",
    "that is , for small @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and the equation of motion is approximated by    @xmath86 observe that the previous equation represents a simple harmonic oscillator of frequence @xmath87 .      since the hamiltonian function @xmath88 is time",
    "independent , it is an integral on phase space and it represents the system energy . using the standard notation @xmath89 in the phase space , we can write    @xmath90    the legendre transformations allow us to give    @xmath91    moreover , it is easy to see that @xmath88 is constant if and only if    @xmath92    is constant ( compare with ( * ? ? ? * prop .",
    "suppose now that the pivot moves along a geodesic path with lineal acceleration @xmath93 .",
    "we come to compute the acceleration induced by the accelerated pivot at the mass making use of a geometric argument .",
    "we follow the following steps :    \\a ) translate to the mass the pivot acceleration @xmath93 .",
    "\\b ) transform this acceleration in angular acceleration between the rod and the geodesic path traced by the pivot .",
    "\\c ) project on the orthogonal direction to the rod .",
    "indeed , consider the geodesic triangle of the figure 4 .",
    "the translated acceleration to the mass is given by @xmath94    and the angular acceleration by @xmath95    finally , in order to project , it is enough to multiply by @xmath96 @xmath97    on another hand , taking into account the previous triangle , from the pythagoras and cosine theorem in non - euclidean geometries , we have @xmath98    thus @xmath99 . as a consequence ,",
    "the searched acceleration is    @xmath100    so , we prove in a different approach the result ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem d ) )    assume that the pivot moves with speed @xmath101 along a geodesic on a surface with constant curvature @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath57 the angle that the rigid rod makes with the direction of the motion of the pivot .",
    "then the pendulum satisfies the differential equation @xmath102    where @xmath103",
    "as a first application , consider us the case of a pendulum whose pivot moves along a geodesic on a surface of constant curvature with constant speed @xmath47 and whose rod is elastic .",
    "let @xmath104 be the elastic constant of the rod , let @xmath1 be the length of the rod and let @xmath105 be the elongation of the rod at the time @xmath58 .",
    "our analytical approach allows us to initiate the study of dynamical system in similar form as the rigid case .",
    "so , it is not difficult to see that its lagrangian function is given by    @xmath106    secondly , we will make an approximation to the quantum system .",
    "denote @xmath107 .",
    "then , ( [ hamiltonian ] ) can be written , for @xmath108 , in terms of @xmath6 and @xmath109 as @xmath110 observe that the same expression , up an additive term , is obtained for @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , a suitable time independient schrodinger equation for this system can be described as    @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a complex function representing the wave function of the mass particle in this physical system .",
    "observe that it is expected that the energy should take quantized values .",
    "in fact , if it is assumed that @xmath113 is confined in a region where @xmath6 is close to @xmath68 , the previous equation , in this first approximation , corresponds to the quantum harmonic oscillator , whose energy is found to be @xmath114 observe that , within this simplification , in the quantum of energy , @xmath115 , appears the speed of the rod and the curvature of the ambient space .",
