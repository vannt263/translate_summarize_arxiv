    "note that condition ( iii ) is in terms of the @xmath12-variables only : we do _ not _ assume that the index set @xmath108 has a `` geometric '' structure and that the @xmath12-variables are `` computed '' from the @xmath130-variables in a `` translation - invariant '' way with respect to that structure ( and the structure of @xmath2 ) .",
    "the goal of our paper is to show that the main result in @xcite , although its proof heavily uses inequalities concerning independent random variables , can be extended to an interesting class of dependent first - passage percolation models . in the setup of the above conditions ( i ) ,",
    "( ii ) , ( iii ) , ( i@xmath135 ) and ( iv ) , we have aimed to obtain fairly general theorems [ mainthm ] and [ mainthm-0 ] , without becoming too general ( which would give rise to so many extra technicalities that the main line of argument would be obscured ) . for instance , from the proofs it will be clear that there is a kind of `` trade - off '' between conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) : one may simultaneously strengthen the first and weaken the second condition .    also , if the bound in condition ( i@xmath135 ) is replaced by a polynomial bound with sufficiently high degree , theorem [ mainthm-0 ] would still hold ( but more explanation would be needed in section [ proof - mainthm-0 ] ) . since the main motivation for adding this theorem to theorem [ mainthm ] is to handle the interesting ising sign - change model studied by higuchi and zhang [ for which we know that condition ( i@xmath135 ) holds ] we have not replaced condition ( i@xmath135 ) by a weaker condition .",
    "in @xcite , the notion `` nice finitary representation '' has been introduced in the context of two - dimensional random fields .",
    "see conditions ( i)(iv ) in section 2 of that paper . in section 2",
    "( see in particular theorem  2.3 in that paper ) , it is shown that the ising model with @xmath64 has such a representation .",
    "( see also @xcite . )",
    "the key ideas and ingredients are exact simulation by coupling from the past ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , and a well - known result by martinelli and olivieri @xcite that under a natural dynamics ( single - site updates ; gibbs sampler ) the system has exponential convergence to the ising distribution .",
    "the random variables used to execute these updates are taken as the @xmath130-variables in the definition of a representation .    condition ( ii ) in @xcite is somewhat weaker than our current condition ( i ) .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite ( see the arguments between theorems 2.3 and 2.4 in @xcite ) , the above mentioned exponential convergence shows that the ising model satisfies an even stronger bound , namely condition ( i@xmath135 ) in our paper .    condition ( iii ) in @xcite corresponds with our condition ( ii ) , and condition  ( iv ) in @xcite is stronger than our condition ( iii ) .    in @xcite , only the two - dimensional case is treated ( because the applications are to percolation models where typical two - dimensional methods are used ) but its arguments concerning `` nice finitary representations '' for the ising model extend immediately to higher dimensions .    from the above considerations",
    ", it follows that the ising models in the statement of our theorem [ thm - ising ] indeed have a representation satisfying our conditions ( i)(iii ) .",
    "application of theorem [ mainthm ] now gives theorem [ thm - ising ] .",
    "the argument is very similar to that in the proof of theorem [ thm - ising ] .",
    "therefore , we only mention the points that need extra attention .    as in the proof of theorem [ thm - ising ] ,",
    "the role of the @xmath130-variables in section [ sect - main - result ] is played by the i.i.d .",
    "random variables driving a single - site update scheme ( gibbs sampler ) . in theorem",
    "[ thm - ising ] , a form of exponential convergence for the gibbs sampler was used .",
    "this exponential convergence came from a result in @xcite . in the current situation ,",
    "the exponential convergence is , as shown in proposition 2.1 in @xcite , a  consequence of the hn condition .",
    "this exponential convergence implies ( again , as in the case of theorem [ thm - ising ] ) condition ( i ) [ and , in fact , the stronger condition ( i@xmath135 ) ] in section [ sect - main - result ] .",
    "condition ( iii ) is obvious , and condition ( ii ) follows easily ( as in the proof of theorem [ thm - ising ] ) from the general setup of the gibbs sampler .",
    "so , again , we now apply theorem [ mainthm ] to obtain theorem [ thm - hn ] .      since @xmath43 , the collection @xmath102 , has ( as pointed out in the proof of theorem [ thm - ising ] ) a representation satisfying conditions ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "in fact , as noted in the proof of theorem [ thm - ising ] , it even satisfies the stronger form ( i@xmath135 ) of condition ( i ) .",

    "the fact that ( iv ) is satisfied follows immediately from lemma 6 [ and ( 1.9 ) ] in @xcite .",
