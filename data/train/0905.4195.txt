    "simulations over the last few years have accumulated strong evidence that gluonic dynamics indeed leads to the formation of a flux tube between test quark and antiquark ( @xmath1 ) in the vacuum of yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "this implies a linearly rising potential between quark and antiquark in the qcd vacuum and thus leads to quark confinement . at large @xmath1 separations",
    ", this flux tube is expected to behave like a string .",
    "open bosonic string descriptions of the dynamics of this flux tube have been attempted for a long time @xcite . using the nambu - goto ( ng ) action , first _ alvarez _",
    "@xcite ( in the limit @xmath2 ) and later _ arvis _",
    "@xcite obtained the energy states of the flux tube as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the string tension , @xmath5 the quark - antiquark separation and @xmath6 the number of space - time dimensions .",
    "a closed string description was proposed by polchinski and strominger ( ps ) @xcite where they suggested how effective string theory with vanishing conformal anomaly could be formulated in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "the spectrum of the string using the ps prescription has been computed in @xcite . to order @xmath7",
    "it has been found that the spectrum is universal ( depends only on the number of space - time dimensions and the string tension ) , and to this order it coincides with the ng spectrum . for a calculation of the closed string spectrum on the lattice see @xcite .",
    "using symmetry properties of the polyakov loop correlation function , lscher and weisz ( lw ) showed that any effective string picture posseses an open - closed duality property @xcite .",
    "they also showed that demanding this duality constrains the possible string spectra and in particular forbids @xmath8 terms in the effective string action . in the lw formulation",
    "too , the spectrum is consistent with the ng spectrum . in 3-dimensions",
    "it is exactly the same and in 4-dimensions one undetermined parameter remains which can of course assume the ng value .",
    "the ng partition function itself respects open - closed duality .",
    "predictions from these theories can be tested by comparing them to results coming from simulations of pure yang - mills theories .    in this letter we will present a new scheme for measuring observables in simulations of pure yang - mills theories . using this scheme we will accurately measure observables in 3-dimensional @xmath9 lattice gauge theory and try to extract the excitation spectrum of the flux tube . for earlier studies of the qcd",
    "string spectra using different schemes in both 3- and 4-dimensions for several gauge theories , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "to probe the properties of the flux tube formed between test quark and antiquark , the two observables in pure yang - mills theories are the polyakov loop correlation function and spatio - temporal wilson loops . while polyakov loop correlation functions project very strongly onto the ground state , wilson loops are much more sensitive to the excited states of the flux tube and in addition allows one to couple more strongly to a particular state while suppressing the others , by appropriate choice of the spatial parts of the loop",
    "it is therefore the observable of choice if one wants to study the excitation spectrum of the flux tube .      in 3-dimensions ,",
    "the states of the oscillating string can be classified by charge - conjugation and parity properties @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "choosing the spatial parts of the wilson loops as shown in figure [ fig1 ] , the @xmath10 projectors are given by the superpositions @xmath11 where @xmath12 stands for even or odd states under @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "although in each of the @xmath10 channels , there are an infinite number of states , we are going to look only at the ground states and will label these channels as @xmath15 respectively . the wilson loop projecting onto a channel @xmath16",
    "has the spectral representation @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the energies of the states in a given channel . using wilson loops with different temporal extents ,",
    "one obtains the energies and energy differences at leading order as    @xmath19 & = & e_{n } ( r ) + \\frac{1}{t_{b}-t_{a } } \\ : \\alpha_{n}(r ) \\ : e^ { - \\delta_{n}(r ) \\ : t_{a } } \\ : \\left ( 1 - e^ { - \\delta_{n}(r ) \\ : ( t_{b } - t_{a } ) } \\right ) \\\\   \\label{eq2.13 } - \\frac{1}{t_{b}-t_{a } } \\ : \\ln \\left [ \\frac { w_{n } ( r , t_{b } ) \\ : w_{m } ( r , t_{a } ) } { w_{n } ( r , t_{a } ) \\ : w_{m } ( r , t_{b } ) } \\right ] & = & \\delta e_{nm}(r ) + \\frac{1}{t_{b}-t_{a } } \\ : \\alpha_{n}(r ) \\ : e^ { - \\delta_{n}(r ) \\ : t_{a } } \\ : \\left ( 1 - e^ { - \\delta_{n}(r ) \\ : ( t_{b } - t_{a } ) } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 . in the following",
    ", the values obtained from the lhs of eqns.([eq2.12 ] ) and ( [ eq2.13 ] ) will be called nave values and be denoted by @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the quantities @xmath23 and @xmath24 will be called corrected values .",
    "they , along with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , are obtained as fit parameters .",

    "string like behavior of the flux tube is expected to occur at large @xmath1 separations .",
    "the wilson loops we measure must therefore extend to large enough @xmath5 values .",
    "also we see from equations ( [ eq2.12 ] ) and ( [ eq2.13 ] ) that to reduce the contaminations due to other states we must either go to large values of @xmath29 or tune @xmath30 to small values by appropriate choice of the basis states . the latter method has been followed in @xcite where asymmetric lattices with small temporal extents were used .",
    "the former method requires accurate measurements of expectation values of large wilson loops , made possible recently by the multilevel algorithm , proposed in @xcite .",
    "this method has been used in @xcite to accurately measure the ground state properties of the flux tube . here",
    "we will try to combine both methods by using a slight variant of the multilevel algorithm .    in the multilevel algorithm ,",
    "intermediate averages are computed for the temporal links by updating certain sub - lattices with the sources on the spatial links of the boundaries of these sub - lattices .",
    "the boundaries are held fixed during the sub - lattice updates .",
    "we now put the sources on space - like surfaces in the middle of a sub - lattice of thickness @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the lattice spacing .",
    "two temporal links are attached to the two ends of the source which terminates on the space - like surfaces that are fixed during the sub - lattice updates ( see fig.[staplefig ] ) .",
    "the advantage is that the sub - lattice updates reduces fluctuations of the sources as well as fluctuations of the temporal links .",
    "moreover , in addition to using multihit on the temporal links , we can now use multihit on the spatial links as well . for further details see @xcite and references therein . adopting the notation in @xcite",
    ", we now define the expectation value of the wilson loop by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the operator of fig.[staplefig ] and @xmath35 indicates sub - lattice averaged quantities .",
    "the only difference from @xcite is that now we have @xmath36 instead of @xmath37 .",
    "a similar method was used in @xcite to measure the static potential and observe string breaking in the adjoint representation .    in most parts of the calculations , the operators @xmath38 ( figure [ fig1 ] top ;",
    "see also @xcite ) are good enough for a reliable signal . however , for the second excited state beyond @xmath39 the error reduction was not sufficient and we had to use another set of operators @xmath40 , ( figure [ fig1 ] bottom ) with a stronger coupling to that particular excited state",
    ". we will henceforth refer to the two sets as set @xmath41 and set @xmath42 , respectively . to check the error reduction with the new set of operators we performed 460 measurements at @xmath39 with spatial extents @xmath43 using the simulation parameters shown in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the resulting relative errors of @xmath44 are also tabulated there .",
    "the values for the nave energies using both sets are plotted in figure [ imprsorfig ] . for comparison",
    "we also plot @xmath45 , which was calculated from @xmath46 , in the same region .",
    "it is clearly seen that not only do the nave values of set @xmath42 already coincide with the corrected values of set @xmath41 , they also have much smaller error bars .",
    "set @xmath42 therefore significantly improves the signal for the state @xmath47 .",
    "there are several parameters for the algorithm , that have to be tuned properly in order to achieve the maximal error reduction . for the temporal links we follow the same procedure as outlined in @xcite .",
    "in addition we now have another parameter which is the number of updates ( @xmath48 ) for the sub - lattices containing the spatial operators .",
    "we found it beneficial for the excited states to have quite a large number of such sub - lattice updates .",
    "since there are only two such sub - lattices for every loop this does not increase the cost of the simulation very much .",
    "table [ tab1 ] contains the resulting optimized run parameters and we refer to @xcite for details of the optimization .",
    ".*left : * parameters of the testruns to compare the operators . *",
    "right : * relative error of @xmath44 in % for operator sets @xmath41 and @xmath42 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we use the groundstate to determine the string tension and fix an additive constant @xmath49 , appearing in the potential , by fitting to the form @xcite : @xmath50 the results of the fits are shown in table [ tab4 ] , where also the values from @xcite are shown for comparison .",
    "we see that all results agree well within error bars .",
    "also @xmath4 and @xmath49 from both operator sets agree with each other .    in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "the results for the total energies are shown against @xmath51 , together with the predictions of the ng spectrum .",
    "the energies are rescaled such that @xmath52 .",
    "the results for the groundstate are completely in agreement with the ng predictions . in this case only the curve of the full spectrum is shown since deviations at different orders of the expansion are not visible on this scale .    for the excited states we were only able to obtain corrected results over a limited range of @xmath5 , except for @xmath53 at @xmath39 where we have results over the full range .",
    "we see that the corrected values for @xmath39 follow the nambu curves quite well . in the region where we are able to obtain corrected energies for all values of @xmath54 , we see good agreement between the different @xmath54 values . at smaller values of @xmath5 where the difference between the ng , lo and nlo curves are visible",
    ", the data seems to favor the ng curve .      .",
    "* bottom : * results for the difference @xmath55 .",
    "the mapping of the curves and the points is the same as in the plot for the total energies.,title=\"fig : \" ] . *",
    "bottom : * results for the difference @xmath55 .",
    "the mapping of the curves and the points is the same as in the plot for the total energies.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we now turn to the energy differences which are more sensitive to subleading properties of the flux tube .",
    "in addition they have the advantage that the constant @xmath49 does not contribute .",
    "the results for the energy differences @xmath56 and @xmath55 are shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "we were able to obtain corrected values using eq.([eq2.13 ] ) only for @xmath56 at @xmath39 .",
    "that data set seems to follow the ng curves quite nicely . for @xmath55 ,",
    "our best estimates are the nave values from eq.([eq2.13 ] ) with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "nevertheless we expect very little systematic effects in these results as the physical temporal extents for these loops are @xmath59 1fm .",
    "again we see that the ng curve is favored by the data .    for @xmath56 at @xmath60 and 12.5 ,",
    "our best estimates come from the difference @xmath61 with the errors being calculated in quadrature .",
    "even though this gives larger error bars , especially at @xmath62 , we see that both data sets are consistent with @xmath39 values .    for @xmath55 at @xmath60 and 12.5 ,",
    "the physical temporal extents of the loops are not large enough that the higher order corrections , unaccounted for in equations ( [ eq2.12 ] ) and ( [ eq2.13 ] ) , are negligible .",
    "nevertheless , at @xmath60 , where it was possible at least partly to take into account the corrections , we see the trend of the data is to follow the ng curve . for @xmath62 , where even that was not possible , the data contains systematic errors and we have not plotted it .",
    "in this letter we have looked at a variant of the multi - level error reduction scheme suitable for studying the excited states of the qcd flux tube . using this scheme",
    "we have looked at the excited states of the flux tube at three different couplings for @xmath0 separations between 0.5 and 1.7 fm .    compared to measurements with the older method @xcite",
    ", we have seen very significant improvements due to the new measurement process .",
    "it has been possible to increase the range of @xmath5 by more than 50% .",
    "since the error in @xmath63 grows roughly proportional to @xmath64 , this would be very hard to achieve by increasing computing power alone .",
    "compared to @xcite , the errors on @xmath65 and @xmath56 have been reduced by a factor between 2 and 3 in the overlapping range of @xmath5 .",
    "this would also be very hard to achieve by increasing statistics alone .",
    "both of these observations clearly demonstrate the superiority of the new measurement process over the older one . moreover using the older method we did not have a signal for the second excited state whereas we do have a reasonable measurement now at least for one @xmath54 value .",
    "our results seem to indicate that in this scheme , with our basis , upto the values of @xmath5 we have considered , one needs temporal extents of about 1 fm to make sure that the corrections due to the higher states are well under control . wherever this criterion has been met",
    ", we have seen that the data follows the ng curve .",
    "the corrected data sets for different @xmath54 values seem to fall on top of each other indicating that there is very little effect due to finite lattice spacing . as such it seems to be much more important to go to larger temporal extents than finer lattices .",
    "unfortunately our data is still not good enough to distinguish between ng , lw and ps type string theories as that would require a sensitivity at the level of @xmath66 .",
    "deviations from the ng predictions at higher orders have recently been reported in @xcite for gauge duals of random percolation problems .",
    "this was our first attempt to show how to combine the two powerful techniques of multi - level error reduction and sophisticated sources for wilson loops . using this we have been able to go to much larger values of @xmath5 and @xmath29 than was possible before . for ruling out different string models",
    ", the error bars will have to be reduced by at least an order of magnitude . that at the moment looks like a project for the future .",
    "the simulations were distributed over three different computational facilities , namely the computing resources of the westflische wilhelms - universitt mnster ( organized with the condor system @xcite ) , where this study was started , the teraflop linux cluster kabru at imsc , chennai and the linux cluster lc2 at the zdv of the johannes gutenberg - universitt mainz .",
    "we are indebted to the institutes for these facilities .",
    "we would also like to thank p. weisz and h. wittig for useful discussions on finite size effects for wilson loops .",
