    "the description of pion production in nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath2 ) interactions near threshold is a traditional problem in hadron physics . in recent times",
    "the interest in it was renewed , due to a wealth of precise experimental data : @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite . on the theoretical side",
    ", the availability of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) allowed the problem to be tackled in a systematic manner .",
    "however , in spite of all the effort made , a satisfactory picture is still not available .",
    "there are two classes of interactions involved in this process , associated with either nucleon correlations or the emission of the external pion . in the procedure developed by koltun and reitan @xcite , these interactions",
    "are encompassed in wave functions and interaction kernels . the former correspond to solutions of the schrdinger equation with realistic potentials , whereas the latter are described by models based on feynman diagrams .    in the discussion of the production kernel ,",
    "one usually distinguishes between long and short range contributions .",
    "the former are shown in fig.[fig.1 ] , where the first diagram represents the impulse approximation and the second , the pion rescattering term .",
    "these two processes were considered by koltun and reitan @xcite in their description of the @xmath11 channel , but the corresponding cross section proved to underestimate recent data @xcite by a factor 5 @xcite .",
    "the rescattering term used in that work came from on shell @xmath0 amplitudes , whereas the pion exchanged in diagram 1b is off - shell .",
    "models which take pion virtuality into account enhances the cross section and tend to reduce underprediction @xcite .",
    "heavy baryon chpt calculations @xcite also stressed the importance of this rescattering term at leading order .",
    "however , in these works the rescattering and impulse terms came out with opposite signs and the net result was again smaller than in phenomenological calculations @xcite .",
    "hence other mechanisms are needed to improve the description .",
    "the next natural step concerns shorter range interactions , especially those involving two pions .",
    "the treatment of uncorrelated two - pion exchange is rather complex and , in the case of pion production , this part of the interaction has been described by effective heavy meson exchanges .",
    "their contributions correspond to the last diagram of fig.[fig.1 ] , known as z - graph , since positive frequency nucleon propagation , already included in the wave function , is subtracted .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 mesons , either explicitly @xcite or into a general axial current density @xcite gave rise to good fits to the @xmath8 cross section at threshold .",
    "however , the study of relativistic effects in @xmath11 production @xcite demonstrated that z - graph effects are small and hence heavy mesons in chpt @xcite do not give rise to the required increase in cross sections .",
    "extension to other channels ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , with inclusion of nucleon resonances @xcite also did not improve the situation .",
    "[ h ]    fig1.eps    some time ago , coon , pea and riska @xcite produced a three - body potential based on the exchanges of a pion and a scalar meson , which proved to be able to reduce the gap between theory and experiment for the binding energy of trinuclei .",
    "later on , we derived an equivalent result , using a non - linear lagrangian , which included an effective chiral scalar meson coupled to nucleons @xcite . in that work ,",
    "the effective field was designed to simulate the two pion exchange potential .",
    "we stress that the exchange of two uncorrelated pions , formulated in the framework of chiral symmetry and including delta degrees of freedom , explains quite well the tail of the scalar - isoscalar nucleon - nucleon potential @xcite and there is no need at all for a true scalar meson to describe that channel . on the other hand ,",
    "the treatment of uncorrelated two pion exchange requires the calculation of many feynman diagrams and , in problems where one is more concerned with simplicity than with fine details , it may be useful to replace all processes associated with the scalar - isoscalar channel by a single effective field . in this conceptual framework ,",
    "our lagrangian gave rise to a strong pion - scalar - nucleon contact interaction , that corresponds to the kernel for the reaction @xmath1 due to the exchange of two pions .",
    "this kernel was then applied to the @xmath11 and @xmath15 production channels and theoretical results were found to be comparable to the experimental ones @xcite .",
    "recently , calculations based on both relativistic @xcite and heavy baryon chpt @xcite dealt with such a transition operator and large contributions were again found , involving several cancellations .",
    "the purpose of the present work is two fold . in sec.ii",
    ", we discuss the relationship between the actual tail of the two - pion exchange potential and that provided by an effective scalar meson .",
    "the pion - production kernel is considered in sec.iii and , in order to determine the role of chiral cancellations , we study the leading term , constructed by means of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 subamplitudes .",
    "our results are indeed based on a partial cancellation , involving three large factors .",
    "we also find that , at large internucleon distances , the kernel has the same spatial dependence as the central @xmath2 potential and hence , in sec.iv , we produce expressions relating these interactions directly .",
    "finally , in sec.v we present a summary and conclusions .",
    "the two - pion exchange potential ( tpep ) is closely related to @xmath0 scattering .",
    "the isoscalar amplitude for the process @xmath19 is represented in fig.[fig.2 ] and given by@xmath20^{(1)}\\;[t^{+}]^{(2)}}{(k^{2}-\\mu^{2})\\,(k^{\\prime\\,2}% -\\mu^{2})}\\ ; , \\label{c1}%\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the isospin symmetric part of amplitude for the process @xmath22 and @xmath23 .

    "this function is related to the @xmath0 @xmath12-term and may , if one wishes , be parametrized as an effective scalar meson exchange .",
    "however , the coupling of this state to nucleons vanishes in the chiral limit and hence this scalar meson does not correspond to that present in the linear @xmath12-model .",
    "we have also obtained a two - pion - exchange kernel for the process @xmath1 , that can be applied in both three body forces and pion production in @xmath2 scattering .",
    "the complete calculation of this kernel would require the evaluation of a large number of diagrams .",
    "thus , in order to estimate the dominant contribution at large @xmath2 distances , we have used just the leading contributions to the subamplitudes @xmath75 and @xmath18 , in the framework of chiral symmetry . the simplified result so obtained involves a cancellation between contact - three - pion and pion - pole vertices .",
    "the latter may also be associated with an off - shell intermediate @xmath0 amplitude and has been include into the tucson - melbourne @xcite two - pion exchange three nucleon potential .",
    "this means that this force does include a term describing a two - pion exchange between a pair of nucleons .",
    "thus , the use of an on - shell @xmath0 amplitude gives rise to a less ambiguous definition of the two - pion exchange three body force @xcite .    at large distances",
    ", the kernel is closely related to the two - pion exchange scalar isoscalar @xmath2 potential .",
    "indeed , in the case of three body forces , we could show that the kernel and the potential have the same spatial dependence .",
    "for threshold pion - production , this relationship is also approximately valid .",
    "these results led us to produce expressions that relate directly the kernel to the potential . using the extreme numerical values for @xmath31 found in the literature , namely 3.68 @xcite and 6.74 @xcite , in eq.([a3 ] ) , one has@xmath124",
    "or@xmath125    these results are quite close to the kernel obtained by ourselves sometime ago @xcite , given by @xmath126 in the case of a models based on effective scalar - isoscalar mesons .. ] this allows one to consider the relationship between the kernel and the potential to be a rather general one .",
    "the reason for this generality springs from the old insight by nambu @xcite and weinberg @xcite that , for generic states @xmath127 and @xmath128 , the leading contributions to the process @xmath129 are obtained by inserting the pion , with gradient coupling , into the external lines of the process @xmath130 .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that we may expect the contributions from the kernel @xmath120 to be large . in order to see this , note that momentum conservation allows one to write @xmath131 and , in the case of threshold pion production , in configuration space one has @xmath132          we thank bira van kolck and carlos a. da rocha for useful conversations .",
