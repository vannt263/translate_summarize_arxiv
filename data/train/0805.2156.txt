    "it is interesting to try to understand if one or more of the pillars of modern physics may be violated by a theory that gives approximately the same experimental results as ordinary relativistic quantum field theory for experiments that are presently accessible .",
    "one such pillar is causality .",
    "theories that are not causal appear , at first glance , to be fraught with paradoxical behavior that renders them inconsistent . in the late 1960 s lee and",
    "wick  @xcite,@xcite proposed an extension of quantum electrodynamics where the pauli - villars regulator is treated as a finite mass scale . in this theory",
    "the fourier transform of the gauge field two - point function has massive `` lee - wick photon '' poles with wrong sign residues .",
    "it is easy to show that this theory is equivalent to a higher derivative theory .",
    "naively such theories are unstable and not unitary .",
    "lee and wick and cutkoski , landshoff , olive and polkinghorne  @xcite gave rules ( the `` lw '' and `` clop prescriptions '' ) for calculating perturbative scattering amplitudes in this higher derivative theory that , for a wide class of feynman diagrams , overcame these difficulties yielding lorentz invariant and unitary scattering amplitudes .",
    "however lee - wick electrodynamics is not causal for microscopic time scales .",
    "their ideas provide a framework for studying acausal theories where the acausality is only detectable in experiments that can access very high energies and/or very short time scales  @xcite .    in recent papers we extended the work of lee and wick to non - abelian gauge theories and argued that they can solve the hierarchy puzzle  @xcite . even if the ideas of lee and wick are not relevant for the hierarchy puzzle it is worth exploring the physics of acausal theories and examining their consistency .",
    "previous work has some limitations .",
    "while the lw and clop prescriptions have been shown to give lorentz invariant scattering amplitudes in a large class of feynman graphs , it is not known whether this is true to all orders in perturbation theory",
    ". moreover , there are serious obstacles to a non - perturbative path integral formulation for the lee - wick theory with a clop prescription  @xcite .",
    "other formulations with prescriptions different from clop s can have a non - perturbative path - integral formulation @xcite , but these have yet to be shown to give a lorentz invariant s matrix@xcite .",
    "perhaps there is some subtle obstacle that prevents the construction of non - trivial lee - wick theories that have a unitary and lorentz invariant @xmath2 matrix to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "we will argue that this is not the case since in large @xmath1 the lee - wick @xmath3 model provides an example of an acausal theory that has a unitary and lorentz invariant @xmath2 matrix .",
    "the leading behavior at large @xmath1 of the scattering amplitudes in the @xmath3 scalar model can be calculated  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the lee - wick version of this theory and argue that at large @xmath1 the scattering matrix is unitary and lorentz invariant .",
    "if the theory has unitary time evolution there will be no paradoxes in experiments that involve normal scalars in the prepared initial state and the observed final state .",
    "after all , for any initial state there are various possible orthogonal final states and the probability for each of them occurring sums to unity .",
    "this theory has unconventional acausal effects , some of which we illustrate with explicit calculations , but that does not mean it is inconsistent .    if a lee - wick extension of the standard model is relevant for the hierarchy puzzle then the acausal effects can be studied indirectly in high energy accelerator experiments through unusual interference effects associated with a lee - wick resonance @xcite , like the wrong sign of the phase shift of the resonant scattering amplitude .",
    "however , there is no compelling reason that acausal effects should occur at the weak scale ; perhaps low energy supersymmetry or a warped extra dimension provide the solution to the hierarchy puzzle .",
    "there are constraints on the masses of the lee - wick resonances from precision electroweak physics .",
    "these are quite strong because integrating out the lee - wick resonances gives tree level contributions to the oblique parameters @xmath2 and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that acausal effects , of the type we are studying in this paper , arise from the extension of the standard model to include a quantized theory of gravity .",
    "string theory is an extension of the standard model that includes a consistent quantum theory of gravity .",
    "at the present time it is widely accepted that string theory is realized in nature .",
    "this is because of a lack of alternatives and because , even though string theory is highly constrained , it has compactifications with enough light degrees of freedom to accommodate the known standard model physics as well as gravity .",
    "however , there is no experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that string theory is realized in nature .",
    "therefore , even if string theory is incompatible with the type of acausality we are studying , it seems worth keeping an open mind on this issue and contemplating the possibility that acausal effects occurring on time scales of order the planck time may arise from the extension of the standard model to include quantum gravity .    in @xcite it was argued that gravitational radiative corrections can induce higher derivative terms of the lee - wick type . in @xcite",
    "a lee - wick theory of gravity was considered .    in the auxiliary field formulation of the @xmath3 model at large @xmath1 the only loop diagrams that enter the calculation of scattering amplitudes",
    "is the one - loop 1pi auxiliary field self - energy . in the lee - wick extension of the @xmath3 model",
    "this feynman diagram can be treated using the lw and clop prescriptions .",
    "hence this theory has a unitary and lorentz invariant @xmath2 matrix at large @xmath1 and this toy model provides a convenient laboratory to study the physics of acausal theories . in this paper",
    "we explore the lee - wick @xmath3 model .",
    "we show by explicit calculation that the two particle scattering amplitudes satisfy the optical theorem , argue that the @xmath2 matrix is unitary and calculate the acausal behavior that arises in some experiments .",
    "higher derivative versions of the @xmath3 model at large @xmath1 have been studied before @xcite and the question of unitarity is taken up by liu in ref .",
    "our investigations differ in several respects .",
    "the prescription that liu uses differs from clop s prescription . in ref .",
    "@xcite terms of order @xmath5 are added to the lagrangian , arranged so that _ at tree level _",
    "there is a complex pair of poles in propagators .",
    "the imaginary part of these poles is not associated with a decay width . in our model only terms of order @xmath6 are added to the lagrangian so that at tree level the two poles in the propagator are at real and positive values of @xmath7 .",
    "it is interactions that turn the wrong residue pole into a complete `` di - pole , '' and the imaginary part is dictated by the physical width . finally , liu s proof of unitarity is indirect while we demonstrate unitarity by direct calculation .",
    "we start our discussion by entertaining the question , how does one go about testing causality or looking for causality violation in a theory that gives only an @xmath2 matrix ?",
    "one may wonder if this is possible at all since formally the @xmath2 matrix relates states of the infinite past to those in the infinite future .",
    "intuitively it is clear that this is no impediment : we may prepare two localized wave packets in the infinite past to travel toward each other and set up detectors to look for the outcome of their collision . moreover , if both the distances traveled by the prepared wave - packets to the collision point and the distances from this point to the detectors are truly macroscopic , then there is an @xmath2 matrix description of this process . clearly , information on the position and timing of first detection of collision products can then give information on the causal behavior of the interaction .",
    "this section formalizes these statements mathematically . in theories with normal causal behavior , a resonant collision that takes place at some space - time point , @xmath8 , results in the production of outgoing stable particles that appear to arise from a second space - time point , @xmath9 .",
    "this second point occurs later in time ( @xmath10 ) and is typically separated from the collision point by proper time of the order of @xmath11 , the inverse of the width of the resonance .",
    "the distribution is a decaying exponential .",
    "this is encapsulated in eq .",
    ", in which the separation between the two points is @xmath12 .",
    "the situation is quite different for resonant collisions through a lee - wick resonance . here",
    "the detected particles appear to come from @xmath9 which occurs earlier than @xmath8 in time ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the points are still separated by proper time of the order of @xmath11 , still distributed as an exponential that decays away from @xmath8 .",
    "this is the content of the final equation in this chapter , eq .  .",
    "we have been careful to state that the collision `` appears to '' take place at @xmath9 .",
    "the measurement is made a long time after and a long distance from the collision region . within the quantum mechanical @xmath2 matrix formalism",
    "there is no means by which we can investigate , nor is there meaning to , the question of precisely where or when the collision takes place .",
    "this observation is important in understanding the interpretation of the results in the case where the collision goes through a lee - wick resonance , where normal causal behavior is violated .",
    "we prepare from stable particles of mass @xmath14 an initial state consisting of two wave packets traveling towards each other from far away .",
    "they are initially localized about spacetime points @xmath15 and @xmath16 which we can assume are space - like separated , @xmath17 and have large negative time components ( we imagine the interaction will take place at around zero time ) .",
    "so we take @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath14 is the mass of the particles .",
    "since they will have to travel a long distance to the interaction point we also take @xmath20 .. by restoring planck s constant , @xmath21 , we see that a simpler , equivalent assumption is that we analyze the kinematics in the semiclassical limit .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the exact scattering amplitude is used in this section , that is , no approximation for the scattering need be made in discussing time dependence in a scattering experiment . ]",
    "we also want the wave packets to have specific momenta .",
    "that is , their fourier transforms are localized about @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "of course , the momenta have to point towards each other so that there is a collision .",
    "the collision occurs at a point @xmath8 such that @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the proper time along the world line of the particle from the start point to the interaction point .",
    "so we take for the initial state @xmath26 with @xmath27 concentrated about @xmath28 , and the fourier transform @xmath29 concentrated about @xmath30 with @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is a real scalar field that , when acting on the vacuum , creates a stable particle of mass @xmath14 .",
    "similarly , we will set up two detectors for the outgoing particles that each record only at a particular point in space at a specific time , that is , at spacetime points @xmath33 .",
    "these points can also be taken as space - like separated and at late times and large distances , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "and we want to absorb specific momenta , @xmath36 .",
    "if the outgoing particles emerge from a point @xmath9 then @xmath37    so we take for the final state @xmath38 with @xmath39 concentrated about @xmath28 , and their fourier transforms concentrated at @xmath40 .",
    "consider now the amplitude for the state @xmath41 to evolve into the state @xmath42    since we have initial points that are space - like separated the order of the fields at @xmath43 and @xmath44 is irrelevant and the same goes for the fields at @xmath45 and @xmath46 . also the fields at @xmath47 have later times than those at @xmath48 .",
    "so we can replace the product of fields above by the time ordered product , which is just the 4-point green function , @xmath49|0\\rangle = \\int \\prod_{i}\\frac{d^4k_i}{(2\\pi)^4 } \\frac{d^4k_i^{\\prime}}{(2\\pi)^4}e^{i ( k_1\\cdot x_1 + k_2\\cdot x_2- k_1^{\\prime}\\cdot x_1^{\\prime}- k_1^{\\prime}\\cdot x_1^{\\prime})}(2\\pi)^4\\delta^{(4 ) } ( k_1+k_2-k_1^{\\prime}-k_2^{\\prime } )   \\\\",

    ". we will consider cases where the amputated 4-point function @xmath50 is the sum of three terms which depend respectively on the mandelstam variables , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . at large separation @xmath54",
    "the amplitude @xmath55 will be negligible except when there is a narrow @xmath51-channel resonance in the 4-point function .",
    "this is clear if we use customary causal intuition , that a narrow resonance can be thought of as a long lived unstable particle produced at @xmath8 decaying _ later _ at @xmath9 , but mathematically it is true even when the resonance `` decays '' at @xmath9 _ before _",
    "therefore to examine the leading dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath56 , for large @xmath54 , only the term that depends on @xmath57 is important and we drop the other pieces .",
    "we denote this term by @xmath58 .",
    "now , multiplying the above by @xmath59 we get @xmath60 where we have introduced @xmath61 and @xmath62    the integral in can be broken into two single particle integrals by representing the delta function as an integral , @xmath63    where @xmath64    we now estimate @xmath65 . to this end notice",
    "that each component of @xmath66 is much larger in magnitude than @xmath67 , by assumption .",
    "we will compute for @xmath68 and come back later to see that the integral in the last line of has support localized around @xmath69 . rewrite @xmath65 by exponentiating the propagator , using the @xmath70 of the normal particle propagator @xmath71    we do first the @xmath72 integration by the method of stationary phase .. ] the condition that the phase be stationary is @xmath73 which implies that @xmath74 so we get    @xmath75    now do the @xmath51-integration also using stationary phase .",
    "the condition is @xmath76_{s = s_i}=0\\ ] ] which implies that @xmath77 and leads to @xmath78    we now put the pieces together .",
    "first , putting the result for @xmath65 above into @xmath79 as given in we have @xmath80    let s investigate this function . using stationary phase , which is justified because we can think of @xmath81 or @xmath14 as large , or equivalently , because we can take @xmath82 , we see that the stationary phase condition gives @xmath83 with @xmath84 satisfying @xmath85 the second and third terms are just the arguments of the functions @xmath86 , which , we recall , have localized support .",
    "so the function @xmath79 is non - zero only for @xmath87 which implies the support is at @xmath88 moreover , we know how to solve for @xmath84 in the region where the integral has support : by eq .",
    "we see that @xmath89 , the point where the interaction takes place .",
    "we conclude then that @xmath90 where @xmath91 is smooth as @xmath82 ; the remaining factor does contain an exponential involving @xmath92 , namely @xmath93 , however this is @xmath81-independent . ] and has support localized at @xmath94 .",
    "note that we are absorbing the phase factor , @xmath95 , into the definition of @xmath91 .",
    "similarly , we conclude that @xmath96 with @xmath97 smooth and with support localized at @xmath98 .    using this information on the structure of @xmath79 and @xmath99 in we have @xmath100",
    "eventually we will calculate the @xmath12 dependence of @xmath55 for large @xmath101 in the lee - wick @xmath3 model . before considering the @xmath3 model its instructive to consider some simpler examples .      here",

    "the free field propagator for the normal scalar takes the usual form @xmath148 , however , the free field propagator for the lee - wick field , @xmath149 , is @xmath150 which differs by an overall minus sign from a conventional scalar of mass @xmath128 . that minus sign means that the propagator that one gets from summing lee - wick self energy insertions develops a complex pole at @xmath151 .",
    "note that this is has positive imaginary part .",
    "since the propagator remains real and regular on a segment of the real axis ( below the two normal particle cut ) , the propagator satisfies green s reflection principle , @xmath152 .",

    "we shall use this form of the propagator to compute the @xmath196 self - energy even though the corrections due to the width are formally subdominant in the @xmath212 expansion .",
    "the subdominant corrections modify the analytic structure and it is this modification that allows the theory to be unitary .",
    "the poles present in the lee - wick propagator are in unusual locations in the complex @xmath7 plane , so we must take care to define the contour of integration in feynman graphs appropriately .",
    "we must understand how to define expressions such as @xmath274 where @xmath275 and @xmath276 may be complex masses , either in the upper or lower half plane of the feynman integration .",
    "let us consider the @xmath277 integral .",
    "the integrand has four poles .",
    "two of the poles are located at @xmath278 the location of the other two poles depends on the value of the external four momentum @xmath81 . for time - like @xmath81",
    "we can go to a frame where @xmath169 and these two poles are located at , @xmath279    the contour lee and wick suggested is such that , once the green s functions are computed by fourier transform from momentum space to space - time , there is no exponential growth in time , and can be described as follows .",
    "consider the position of the poles as a function of the coupling @xmath213 present in the theory . at @xmath280",
    "the widths vanish , so @xmath275 and @xmath276 are real masses .",
    "then the contour is defined to be the usual feynman contour . as @xmath213 increases away from zero",
    "the lee - wick particles become unstable , the poles on the real line become complex pairs of poles that move away from the real axis .",
    "the lee - wick prescription is to deform the contour , as @xmath213 increases from zero , so that the complex poles do not cross the contour ; a pole which was initially below the contour remains below the contour , for example .     plane .",

    "the heavy line denotes the cuts on the real axis starting at @xmath284 .",
    "the contour of integration is deformed as the interactions are turned on and the lw poles move into the complex plane so that the complex poles do not cross the contour.,width=288 ]    if the external momentum is in the unphysical region this prescription is unambiguous .",
    "for example , for the integral in , one can start with @xmath285 .",
    "as the momentum is varied ( for fixed , non - zero @xmath213 ) poles may cross a contour .",
    "however , the integral can still be defined by deforming the contour so as to avoid the pole .",
    "this leads to a well - defined contour unless poles pinch it .",
    "the pinching occurs when a pole in eq .",
    "coincides with one in eq .  , and signals the presence of a singularity , usually a branch cut , in the integral @xmath286 ( as a function of @xmath81 ) .",

    "the self - energy @xmath200 is unambiguously defined and lorentz invariant , and may be computed using standard methods . in particular , the contour we have chosen allows us to wick - rotate the integral in eq .   and in all feynman integrals we will encounter . in the following",
    ", we will compute the integrals in dimensional regularization and discard the divergent pieces that are proportional to @xmath293 in addition to the finite pieces involving the logarithm of @xmath294 and eulers constant . in the lee - wick o(n ) model they cancel , since the theory is finite by naive power counting in the higher derivative formulation .",

    "we define @xmath295 as before .",
    "there are various graphs contributing .",
    "the graph involving only the normal particles reproduces the self - energy in the normal @xmath3 model , eq .  .",
    "to simplify the notation , we define a function @xmath296 discarding the divergent piece that is proportional to @xmath293 and the finite constant pieces involving the logarithm of @xmath297 and euler s constant we find @xmath298 it is easy to verify that the only candidate singularity of @xmath299 , as a function of the complex variable @xmath300 , is a branch cut with branch point at @xmath301 .",

    "previously , in our discussion of unitarity of scattering in the normal @xmath3 model , we argued that the only allowed final state at leading order is the two particle final state .",

    "the remaining parts of the integrand can then be interpreted as the amplitude to create the intermediate lee - wick particle plus one of the final state normal particles .",
    "the amplitude to create the intermediate state is given up to sign by eq .  .",
