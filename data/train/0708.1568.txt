    "standard derivative pricing theory is based on the assumption of frictionless and perfectly liquid markets . in particular",
    ", it is assumed that all investors are _ small _ relative to the market so that they can buy arbitrarily large quantities of the underlying assets without affecting its price ( perfectly liquid markets ) .",
    "given the scale of hedging activities on many financial markets this is clearly unrealistic .",
    "hence in recent years a number of approaches for dealing with market illiquidity in the pricing and the hedging of derivative securities have been developed .",
    "the financial framework that is being used differs substantially between model classes .",
    "however , as shown in section  [ sec : illiquid .- markets ] below , in all models derivative prices can be characterized by fully nonlinear versions of the standard parabolic black - scholes pde . moreover",
    ", these nonlinear black - scholes equations have a very similar structure .",
    "this makes these nonlinear black - scholes equations a useful reference point for studying derivative asset analysis under market illiquidity . in sections  3",
    "we therefore study scaling properties and compute explicit solutions for a typical fully nonlinear black - scholes equation ; section  4 is devoted to studying properties of solutions and sensitivities with respect to model parameters .",
    "the relevant literature is discussed in the body of the paper .",
    "in order to motivate the subsequent analysis we present a brief synopsis of three different frameworks for modeling illiquid markets .",
    "we group them under the labels a)_transaction - cost models _ ; b ) _ reduced - form sde - models _ ; c ) _ reaction - function _ or _ equilibrium models_. in particular , we show that the value function of a certain type of selffinancing strategies ( so called _ markovian _ strategies ) must be a solution of a fully nonlinear version of the standard black - scholes equation . in all models there will be two assets , a risk - free money - market account @xmath0 which is perfectly liquid and a risky and illiquid asset @xmath1 ( the stock ) . without loss of generality , we use the money market account as numeraire ; hence @xmath2 , and interest rates can be taken equal to zero .    *",
    "( quadratic ) transaction - cost models . *",
    "the predominant model in this class has been put forward by cetin , jarrow and protter @xcite . in this model",
    "there is a _",
    "fundamental _ stock price process @xmath3 following geometric brownian motion , @xmath4 for constants @xmath5 , @xmath6 and a standard brownian motion @xmath7 .",
    "the _ transaction price _ to be paid at time @xmath8 for trading @xmath9 shares is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a liquidity parameter .",
    "intuitively , in the model ( [ eq : transaction - price ] ) a trader has to pay a spread whose size relative to the fundamental price , @xmath12 , depends on the amount @xmath9 which is traded . as shown by @xcite , this leads to transaction costs which are proportional to the _ quadratic variation _ of the stock trading strategy . in order to formulate this statement",
    "more precisely we consider a selffinancing trading strategy @xmath13 giving the number of stocks and the position in the money market for predictable stochastic processes @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the _ value _ of this strategy at time @xmath8 equals @xmath16 .",
    "consider now a _",

    "i.e. a trading strategy of the form @xmath17 for a smooth function @xmath18 . in this case",
    "@xmath14 is a semimartingale with quadratic variation given by @xmath19_t = \\int_0^t \\left ( \\phi_s(s , s^0_s ) \\sigma s_s^0 \\right)^2 ds \\,;\\ ] ] see for instance chapter  2 of @xcite .",
    "then theorem a3 of @xcite yields the following dynamics of @xmath20 @xmath21_t =           \\phi(t , s_t^0 ) ds_t^0 - \\rho s_t^0 \\left ( \\phi_s(t , s^0_t ) \\sigma s_t^0\\right ) ^2 dt.\\ ] ] note that according to ( [ eq : vt - protter ] ) , the market impact of the large trader leads to an extra transaction - cost term of size @xmath22_s $ ] in the wealth dynamics .",
    "suppose now that @xmath23 and @xmath18 are smooth functions such that @xmath24 gives the value of a selffinancing trading strategy with stock position @xmath25 . according to the it formula , the process @xmath26 has dynamics @xmath27 comparing this with ( [ eq : vt - protter ] ) , using the uniqueness of semimartingale decompositions it is immediate that @xmath23 must satisfy the pde @xmath28 and that moreover @xmath29 .",
    "the last relation gives @xmath30 , so that we obtain the following nonlinear pde for @xmath23 @xmath31 when pricing a derivative security with maturity date @xmath32 and payoff @xmath33 for some function @xmath34 we have to add the terminal condition @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "for instance , in case of a european call option with strike price @xmath37 we have @xmath38 .",
    "note that the original paper @xcite goes further in the analysis of quadratic transaction cost models . to begin with",
    ", a general framework is proposed that contains ( [ eq : transaction - price ] ) as special ( but typical ) case .",
    "moreover , conditions for absence of arbitrage for a general class of trading strategies - containing markovian trading strategies as special case - are given , and a notion of approximative market completeness is studied .",
    "* reduced - form sde models .",
    "* under this modeling approach it is assumed that investors are _ large traders _ in the sense that their trading activity affects equilibrium stock prices .",
    "more precisely , given a liquidity parameter @xmath39 and a semimartingale @xmath14 representing the stock trading strategy of a given trader , it is assumed that the stock price satisfies the sde @xmath40 the intuitive interpretation is as follows given that the investor buys ( sells ) stock ( @xmath41 ) the stock price is pushed ( downward ) upward by @xmath42 ; the strength of this price impact depends on the parameter @xmath11 .",
    "note that for @xmath43 the asset price simply follows a black - scholes model with reference volatility @xmath44 .",
    "the model ( [ eq : price - sde - model ] ) is studied among others in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .    in the sequel",
    "we denote the asset price process which results if a large uses a particular trading strategy @xmath14 by @xmath45 .",
    "suppose as before that the trading strategy is markovian , i.e.  of the form @xmath46 for a smooth function @xmath18 .",
    "applying the it formula to ( [ eq : price - sde - model ] ) shows that @xmath47 is an it process with dynamics @xmath48 with _ adjusted volatility _ given by @xmath49 see for instance @xcite for details . in the model  ( [ eq : price - sde - model ] ) , a portfolio with stock trading strategy @xmath14 and value @xmath50 is termed _ selffinancing _ , if satisfies the equation @xmath51 .",
    "note that the form of the strategy @xmath14 affects the dynamics of @xmath1 ; this _ feedback effect _ will give rise to nonlinearities in the wealth dynamics as we now show .",

    "as before , applying the it formula to the process @xmath54 yields @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , @xmath23 must satisfy the relation @xmath56 . using ( [ eq : adjusted - vol-1 ] ) and the relation @xmath57 we thus obtain the following fully nonlinear pde for @xmath58 @xmath59 again , for pricing derivative securities a terminal condition corresponding to the particular payoff at hand needs to be added .",
    "* equilibrium or reaction - function models .",
    "* here the model primitive is a smooth _ reaction function _ @xmath60 that gives the equilibrium stock price @xmath61 at time @xmath8 as function of some fundamental value @xmath62 and the stock position of a large trader .",
    "a reaction function can be seen as reduced - form representation of an economic equilibrium model , such as the models proposed in @xcite , @xcite or @xcite . in these models",
    "there are two types of traders in the market : ordinary investors and a large investor .",
    "the overall supply of the stock is normalized to one .",
    "the normalized stock demand of the ordinary investors at time @xmath8 is modelled as a function @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the proposed price of the stock .",
    "the normalized stock demand of the large investor is written the form @xmath65 ; @xmath66 is a parameter that measures the size of the trader s position relative to the total supply of the stock .",
    "the equilibrium price @xmath61 is then determined by the market clearing condition @xmath67 under suitable assumptions on @xmath68 equation ( [ eq : equilibrium ] ) admits a unique solution , hence @xmath61 can be expressed as a function @xmath60 of @xmath62 and @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath69 . for instance we have in @xcite @xmath70 ; the model used in @xcite and @xcite leads to the reaction function @xmath71 the reaction - function approach is also used in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "now we turn to the characterization of selffinancing hedging strategies in reaction - function models . throughout",
    "we assume that the fundamental - value process @xmath72 follows a geometric brownian motion with volatility @xmath44 ( see ( [ eq : bs - model ] ) ) . moreover , we assume that the reaction function is of the form @xmath73 for some increasing function @xmath74 .",
    "this holds for the specific examples introduced above and , more generally , for any model where @xmath75 for a strictly increasing function @xmath76 with suitable range .",
    "assuming as before that the normalized trading strategy of the large trader is of the form @xmath77 for a smooth function @xmath18 we get from it s formula , since @xmath78 , @xmath79 the precise form of @xmath80 is irrelevant for our purposes . rearranging and integrating the expression @xmath81 over both sides of this equation gives the following dynamics of @xmath1 : @xmath82    a very general analysis of the dynamics of selffinancing strategies in reaction - function models ( and generalizations thereof ) using the _ it - wentzell formula _ can be found in @xcite .",
    "a similar reasoning as in the case of the reduced - form sde models now gives the following pde for the value function @xmath58 of a selffinancing strategy @xmath83 in particular , for @xmath84 we have @xmath85 and ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - psi ] ) reduces to equation ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - sde ] ) ; for @xmath86 as in @xcite , @xcite , we get the pde @xmath87    * nonlinear black - scholes equations .",
    "* the nonlinear pdes ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - protter ] ) , ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - sde ] ) , ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - psi ] ) and ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - sircar ] ) are all of the form @xmath88 where @xmath89 . since @xmath11 is often considered to be small , it is of interest to replace @xmath90 with its first order taylor approximation around @xmath91 .",
    "it is immediately seen that for the equations ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - sde ] ) and ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - sircar ] ) this linearization is given by @xmath92 replacing @xmath90 with this first order taylor approximation in ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - sde ] ) and ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - sircar ] ) thus immediately leads to the pde ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - protter ] ) .",
    "note that ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - general ] ) is a fully nonlinear equation in the sense that the coefficient of the highest derivative is a nonlinear function of this derivative .",
    "a similar feature can be observed for the limiting price in certain transaction cost models under a proper rescaling of transaction cost and trading frequency ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "nonlinear pdes for incomplete markets obtained via exponential utility indifference hedging such as @xcite or @xcite on the other hand are quasi - linear equations in the sense that the highest derivative @xmath93 enters the equation in a linear way , similar to the well - known reaction - diffusion equations arising in physics or chemistry . from an analytical point of view",
    "the nonlinearities arising in both cases are quite different . in the latter quasi - linear case",
    "we have to do with a regular perturbation of the classical black - scholes ( bs ) equation but in the case ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - psi ] ) we have to do with singular perturbation , meaning that the highest derivative is included in the perturbation @xcite . in case of a regular perturbation it is typical to look for a representation of a solutions to a quasi - linear equation in the form @xmath94 for many forms of nonlinearities the uniform convergence as @xmath95 of the expansions of type ( [ as ] ) can be established . if the perturbation is of the singular type , the asymptotic expansion of type ( [ as ] ) typically breaks down for some @xmath96 and some @xmath97 .",
    "it can as well happens that the definition domain for the solutions of type ( [ as ] ) include just one point or that it is empty .",
    "it is very important to obtain explicit solutions for such models because in these case we can not hope to get good approximations for solutions by expansions of the type ( [ as ] ) in the whole region .",
    "our goal in this section is to investigate the nonlinear black - scholes equation ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - sde ] ) using analytical methods .",
    "as we have just seen , this equation is typical for the nonlinearities arising in pricing equations for derivatives in illiquid markets in general . ) and ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - sircar ] ) as well ; see @xcite for details . ] using the symmetry group and its invariants the partial differential equation ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - sde ] ) can be reduced in special cases to ordinary differential equations .",
    "in @xcite a special family of invariant solutions to the equation ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - sde ] ) was studied ; in particular , the explicit solutions were used as test case for various numerical methods . in the present paper",
    "we study _ all _ invariant solutions to equation ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - sde ] ) .      in order to describe the symmetry group of ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - sde ] ) we use results from bordag  @xcite . in that paper the slightly more general equation @xmath98 with a continuous function @xmath99",
    "is studied ( note that for @xmath100 this equation reduces to ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - sde ] ) ) and the following theorem was proved .",

    "as we will see later , the solutions found in @xcite for the case @xmath107 can be used to obtain the complete set of invariant solutions to equation ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - sde ] ) .",
    "for @xmath108 with @xmath109 we can use ( [ strsp ] ) to obtain a new independent invariant variable @xmath110 and ( [ utrosp ] ) to obtain a new dependent variable @xmath90 ; these variables are given by @xmath111 using these variables we can reduce the partial differential equation ( [ uravlam ] ) to the ordinary differential equation @xmath112 where @xmath113 it is a straightforward consequence of theorem  [ symteor ] that these are the only nontrivial invariant variables .",
    "in the sequel we will determine explicit solutions for ( [ speck1 ] ) for the case @xmath114 which corresponds to the original equation ( [ eq : nonlinear - bs - sde ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ speck1 ] ) with @xmath114 and @xmath115 are related to each other .",
    "note however , that the relation between the corresponding solutions is not so straightforward , because ( [ speck1 ] ) is nonlinear and we need real valued solutions . hence the results from @xcite - where ( [ speck1 ] ) was studied for the case @xmath115 - do not carry over directly to the present case @xmath114 , so that a detailed analysis of the case @xmath114 is necessary .    to find families of invariant solution we introduce a new dependent variable @xmath116",
    "if we assume that the denominator of the equation ( [ speck1 ] ) is different from zero , we can multiply both terms of equation ( [ speck1 ] ) by the denominator of the second term and obtain @xmath117 we denote the left hand side of this equation by @xmath118 .",
