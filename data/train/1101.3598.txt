    "the little higgs theory is proposed as an elegant solution to the hierarchy problem of the standard model ( sm ) and is now an important candidate of new physics @xcite . among various little higgs models , the littlest higgs ( lh ) model @xcite is the simplest but phenomenologically viable model , which incorporates all essential ingredients of the little higgs theory .",
    "unfortunately , this economic model suffers from severe constraints from the precisely measured electroweak data , and one has to tune finely its parameters to survive the constraints @xcite .",
    "to avoid this problem , a new discrete symmetry called t - parity was introduced and the resulting model is referred to as the littlest higgs model with t - parity ( lht ) @xcite . in the lht model ,",
    "all dangerous contributions to the electroweak data are loop suppressed , and consequently wide regions of its parameter space are consistent with the data even when the breaking scale of the t - parity , @xmath2 , is as low as @xmath3 gev @xcite . on the other hand , to implement the t - parity one has to introduce a mirror fermion ( t - odd quark / lepton ) for each sm fermion . in general , the mass matrix for the mirror quarks / leptons is not proportional to that of their sm counterparts , and due to the misalignment of the mass matrix , neutral flavor changing ( fc ) interactions between the two types of fermions may naturally appear , which will induce flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes for both quarks and leptons at loop level @xcite . since these processes are highly suppressed in the sm , they can be utilized to probe new physics and any observation of them will undoubtedly imply the existence of new physics .    since the observation of the neutrino oscillation , searching for the lfv signals at colliders has attracted more and more attention @xcite .",
    "the lfv production processes , such as @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath1 , have been studied in r - parity conversing mssm @xcite , r - parity violating mssm @xcite and tc2 model @xcite .",
    "these study indicates that the production rates can be several order larger than those in the sm and may reach the sensitivity of future experiments .",
    "we note that , in the lht the fc interaction can also induce the production processes , and compared the lfv decays such as @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 studied in the lht model @xcite with the decays in other new physics models @xcite , we infer that the production rate is not suppressed in comparison with the predictions of the other model .",
    "this encourages us to study the production processes in detail . among different production processes , we are more interested in @xmath0 ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) occurred at the proposed international linear collider ( ilc ) since the ilc provides rather clean environment to probe these processes .    this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly review the lht model . in section iii and iv , we show the details of our calculation of the production rates and present numerical results respectively .",
    "finally , a short conclusion is drawn in section v.",
    "in this sector , we briefly recapitulate the structure of the lht model and define the conventions of our notation . a detailed description of the model can be found in @xcite .    basically speaking , the lht model is a non - linear sigma model describing the spontaneous breaking of a global @xmath10 down to a global @xmath11 .",
    "this symmetry breaking takes place at the scale @xmath12 ( tev ) , and along with this breaking , there arise 14 goldstone bosons which are described by the  pion\"matrix @xmath13 among the goldstone bosons , the fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 are eaten by the new t - odd heavy gauge bosons @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . as a result , these gauge bosons acquire masses which up to @xmath19 are given by @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 denoting the sm @xmath23 and @xmath24 gauge couplings respectively and @xmath25 being the electroweak breaking scale .",
    "quite similarly , the fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 are eaten by the sm gauge bosons ( t - even ) after the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the masses of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 bosons are then given by @xmath30 note in the lht model , the neutral gauge boson @xmath18 is the lightest t - odd particle , and due to the conservation of t - parity , it is stable and thus can act as an dark matter candidate @xcite .    in order to implement the t - parity , each sm fermion must be accompanied by its mirror fermion .",
    "the particle content of the lht then includes the t - even fermions , such as the sm quarks , leptons and an additional heavy quark @xmath31 , and their mirror fermions . in this paper , we denote the mirror leptons by @xmath32 with their masses given by @xcite @xmath33 obviously , neglecting the @xmath19 correction to @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is generation index ) , the mirror neutrino and the mirror lepton in the same generation are degenerated in mass .    in a similar way to what happens for the sm fermions , the mirror sector has weak mixing parameterized by unitary mixing matrices , i.e. @xmath36 , @xmath37 for mirror leptons and @xmath38 , @xmath39 for mirror quarks which satisfy the following physical constraints : @xmath40 these mirror mixing matrices imply flavor violating interactions between sm fermions and mirror fermions that are mediated by the heavy gauge boson @xmath41 , @xmath16 and @xmath18",
    "the relevant feynman rules are given in @xcite .",
    "in the lht model . ]",
    "we have mentioned that the interaction between the mirror lepton and the sm lepton , such as @xmath43 and @xmath44 , can induce lfv interactions at loop level .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] for @xmath45 and @xmath46 vertexes . unlike the previous studies where the unitary gauge were used in the calculation @xcite",
    ", we use feynman gauge to obtain our results , and that is why we also plot the diagrams involving the goldstone bosons @xmath15 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 in fig.[fig : fig1 ] .",
    "we once compared our results for the decay @xmath49 with @xcite and found we can reproduce fig .  4 of this literature .",
    "note in the lht , the t - odd scalar triplet @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ goldstone ] ) can also contribute to the lfv vertex by the @xmath51 interaction .",
    "however , since such interaction is suppressed by @xmath52 , we can neglect its contribution at the leading order of @xmath53 expansion .",
    "the feynman diagrams for the production @xmath54 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] with the black square denoting the loop - induced @xmath55 vertex . one important difference of the @xmath56 vertex in @xmath57 and in @xmath58 is both the leptons are on - shell for @xmath57 , while either @xmath59 or @xmath60 is off - shell for @xmath61 . in order to simplify calculation ,",
    "we d better use an universal form of the @xmath46 vertex which is valid for the both cases .",
    "this is possible as suggested by @xcite . in our calculation , we use the method in @xcite to get the effective @xmath62 vertex and present their expressions in detail in appendix a. we numerically check the rates of the production processes are free of ultraviolet divergence .",
    "we use the code looptools @xcite to calculate the loop functions appeared in the effective vertexes .     in the lht model with the black squares denoting the effective @xmath62 vertex introduced in @xcite .",
    "diagrams with the two photon lines crossed are not shown for @xmath63 . ]      with the aid of the effective @xmath62 vertex , one can write down the amplitude of @xmath64 by a straightforward calculation of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) : @xmath65 with @xmath66u_{e^{-}}(p_{1}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) is the effective @xmath69(@xmath70 ) vertex which depends on the lepton momenta @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "similarly , the amplitude of @xmath61 is given by @xmath75    for the @xmath76 collision at the ilc , the photon beams are generated by the backward compton scattering of incident electron- and laser - beams just before the interaction point .",
    "the events number is obtained by convoluting the cross section with the photon beam luminosity distribution . for @xmath76 collider the events number",
    "is obtained by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the photon beam luminosity distribution and @xmath79 , with @xmath80 being the energy - square of @xmath81 collision , is defined as the effective cross section of @xmath82 . in optimum case",
    ", @xmath83 can be written as @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the energy spectrum of the back - scattered photon for unpolarized initial electron and laser photon beams given by @xmath86 the definitions of parameters @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 can be found in @xcite . in our numerical calculation",
    ", we choose @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "before we end this section , we emphasize two advantages of @xmath93 collision over the @xmath94 collision of the ilc in probing the lfv interaction .",
    "one is for the process",
    "@xmath95 , it occurs only via s - channel , so its rate is suppressed by the photon propagator and the @xmath28 propagator . while for @xmath96 , there is no such suppression .",
    "the other is the @xmath76 collision provides a cleaner environment than the @xmath81 collision , so is well suited to probe new physics .",
    "in our calculations , we neglect terms proportional to @xmath97 in the new gauge boson masses and also in the relevant feynman rules . we take the sm parameters as @xcite : @xmath98 among the lht parameters , we must specify the breaking scale @xmath2 , the mirror lepton masses as well as the matrix @xmath99 .",
    "we choose @xmath100 gev and @xmath101 gev as two representative cases , and as shown in @xcite , these two cases are consistent with precision electroweak data . about the mirror lepton masses , we fix @xmath102 gev , and vary @xmath103 in the range of @xmath104 gev for @xmath105 gev and @xmath106 gev for @xmath107 gev .",
    "we set @xmath108 ( or equally @xmath109 ) , and like @xcite did , determine the elements of @xmath110 from the neutrino experiments @xcite with the three majorana phases in @xmath110 taken to be zero . from the results of @xcite , one can learn that our choice of the lht parameters satisfies the constraint from @xmath111 and the rare decays @xmath112 . by the way , in calculating the rates for @xmath113 we require @xmath114 and @xmath115 gev @xcite .",
    "+    our results are summarized in fig .",
    "3 with different @xmath116 states considered . from this figure , one can get three conclusions .",
    "the first is the production rates of @xmath0 monotonously increase with @xmath117 becoming larger .",
    "this is because these processes proceed in a way quite similar to the gim mechanism of the sm , so the more significant the mass splitting between the mirror leptons is , the larger the rates become .",
    "the second is the rate for @xmath1 is several orders larger than that of @xmath64 .",
    "the reason is , as we mentioned before , that the process @xmath118 is s - channel suppressed , while the process @xmath1 gets contribution from u - channel and t - channel and there is no such suppression .",
    "the last is among the lfv processes , the rate for @xmath119 final state is much smaller than that for @xmath120 or @xmath121 state .",
    "this is because the processes with @xmath119 final state are stringently constrained by the decay @xmath122 .",
    "+    since the production rates for @xmath123 are significantly larger than the other production rates , we now discuss their observability at the ilc . for @xmath124 ,",
    "its main backgrounds come from @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 . in order to enhance the ratio of the signal to the background , one usually adds the following cuts in monte carlo simulation @xcite : @xmath114 and @xmath128gev . with these cuts ,",
    "the rates for the background processes at @xmath129= 500gev are @xmath130 fb for @xmath131 , @xmath132 fb for @xmath133 , and @xmath134 fb for @xmath127 respectively ( see table 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that to get a @xmath135 observing sensitivity with @xmath136 fb@xmath137 integrated luminosity @xcite , the production rate for @xmath138 must be larger than @xmath139 fb @xcite .",
    "compared this value with the results in fig .  3",
    ", one can learn that the process @xmath140 may be observable in broad regions of the lht parameter space .",
    "with regard to @xmath141 , since its production rate may be several times larger than that for @xmath142 while the background rates are same , one can conclude that @xmath141 is more powerful in probing the lht model .    for the sake of providing more information of the ilc in probing the lht model",
    ", we also show the rates of @xmath0 as the function of center - of - mass energy of the ilc @xmath129 in fig .",
    "we see that with the increase of @xmath129 , the production rates become smaller which is similar to the behaviors of the supersymmetric models @xcite .",
    "we also list the theoretical predictions of the production rates in the optimum case of different models in table i. from this table , one can learn that , due to enhanced coupling strength , the production rates in the lht and tc2 model can be significantly larger than that in r - parity violating mssm .",
    "so the processes of @xmath1 may be utilized to distinguish new physics models .",
    ".the theoretical predictions of the rates for @xmath143 at @xmath144 gev in the optimum case of different models .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the lht model , the interactions between the mirror leptons and the sm leptons induce the lfv processes at loop level .",
    "we study the lfv productions @xmath0 at the ilc , and find that , compared with the sm predictions , the production rates in the lht can be greatly enhanced . in particular , the production rates for @xmath145 and for @xmath146 can reach 1 fb and @xmath147 fb respectively in optimum case , which fall within the 3@xmath148 observing sensitivity of the ilc .",
    "therefore , these lfv production process at the ilc may be utilized to probe the lht model .",
