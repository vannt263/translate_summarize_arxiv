    "the quantum measurement postulate is one of the most intriguing and historically controversial pieces of quantum mechanics .",
    "it usually appears as a separate postulate , as it introduces a non - unitary time evolution .    on the other hand , at least in principle , qubit and detector",
    "can be described by a coupled manybody hamiltonian and thus the measurement process can be investigated using the established tools of quantum mechanics of open systems . even though this does not lead to a solution of the fundamental measurement paradox , such research gives insight into the _ physics _ of quantum measurement @xcite .",
    "this basic question has also gained practical relevance and has become a field of experimental physics in the context of quantum computing .",
    "specifically , superconducting qubits have been proposed as building block of a scalable quantum computer @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the detector is based on the same technology  small , underdamped josephson junctions  as the device whose state is to be detected .",
    "thus these circuits are an ideal test - bed to investigate the physics of quantum measurement . implementing a measurement which is fast and reliable , with a high",
    "( single - shot ) resolution and high visibility is a topic of central importance to the practical implementation of these devices .",
    "the basic textbook version of a quantum measurement is based on von neumann s postulate @xcite .",
    "the state of the system is projected onto the eigenstate of the observable being measured corresponding to the eigenvalue being observed .",
    "this is not the only possible quantum measurement and has been generalized to the idea of a positive operator - valued measure @xcite .    from the microscopic , hamiltonian - based perspective",
    ", intensive research has been done on the measurement of small signals , which originated in the theory of gravitational wave detection @xcite .",
    "the main challenge has been to identify how signals below the limitations of the uncertainty relation of the detector can be measured - a regime in which the detector response is also strictly linear .",
    "this work has resulted in the notion of a quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement  @xcite , which is the closest to a microscopic formulation of a von neumann measurement .",
    "this result has been generalized to many other systems , prominently atomic physics , and also found its way to the superconducting qubits literature . here , the analogy of a tiny signal is the limit of weak coupling between qubit and detector .",
    "another body of work @xcite takes a more general starting point and discusses the relevance of pointer state and environment induced superselection .",
    "the measurement techniques used in superconducting qubits are covering many of the mentioned situations .",
    "weak measurements can be performed using single electron transistors .",
    "based on weak measurement theory , this is well understood ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) but only of limited use for superconducting qubits .",
    "there the measurements are far from projective , their resolution is in practice rather limited and the whole process is very slow . in the case of qubit ,",
    "the task is _ not _ to amplify an arbitrarily weak signals , but to discriminate two states in the best possible way .",
    "if the detector can be decoupled from the qubit when no measurement needs to be performed , this discrimination may involve strong qubit - detector coupling @xcite .",
    "an opposite , generic approach is to perform a switching measurement  the detector switches out of a metastable state depending on the state of qubit .",
    "switching is a highly nonlinear phenomenon , so this type of detection is far from the weak measurement scenario . in most of the early generic setup ,",
    "this process is a switching of a superconducting device , e.g. a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) , from the superconducting to the dissipative state @xcite .",
    "this technique goes a long way , and some experiments have proven that the switching type of readout can achieve high contrast @xcite .",
    "it has the drawback that it is not a projective readout and during the switching process hot quasiparticles with a long relaxation time are created .",
    "this limits the time between the consecutive measurements .",
    "parts of this technique are well understood , such as the switching histogram @xcite , the pre - measurement backaction @xcite , and the influence of the shunt impedance to the squid @xcite , but there is no full and single theory of this process on the same level of detail as the weak measurement theory .",
    "recent developments of detection schemes have lead to vast improvements based on two innovations : instead of directly measuring a certain observable pertaining to a qubit state , one uses a pointer system , and measures one of its observables influenced by the state of the qubit .",
    "the observation is usually materialized in the frequency shift of an appropriate resonator , whose response to an external excitation links to the measurement outcome @xcite .",
    "these measurements offer good sensitivity , high visibility @xcite , and fast repetition rates .",
    "they also allow to keep the qubit at a well - defined operation point , although not always the optimum one .",
    "in many cases , the resonators in use are nonlinear  based on josephson junctions .",
    "thus , at stronger excitation , generic nonlinear effects can be exploited .",
    "these nonlinear effects go up to switching , which in contrast to the critical current switching is between two dissipationless states @xcite . due to this performance and versatility , these devices also offer an ideal example for investigating the crossover between weak and strong measurements and the role of nonlinearity .    analyzing the properties of quantum measurement",
    "is an application of open quantum systems theory : the backaction contains a variant of projection which can be viewed in an ensemble as dephasing .",
    "the resolution is determined by the behavior of the detector under the influence of the qubit viewed as an environment . for open quantum systems ,",
    "a number of tools have been developed .",
    "most of them , prominently born and born - markov master equations ( see e.g.   @xcite and references therein for a recent review ) assume weak coupling between qubit and environment and are hence a priori unsuitable for studying strong qubit - detector coupling .",
    "tools for stronger coupling have been developed @xcite but are largely restricted to harmonic oscillator baths and hence unsuitable to treat the generally nonlinear physics of the systems of interest .",
    "the lindblad equation @xcite is claimed to be valid up to strong coupling , however , due to its strong markovian assumption it is unsuitable for strongly coupled superconducting systems .",
    "in this paper we present a theoretical tool allowing to describe dispersive measurements involving nonlinearities .",
    "the tool is developed alongside the example of the experimental setup studied in ref .",
    "it is based on the complex environments approach similar to what is used in cavity qed @xcite but also in condensed - matter open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the idea is to introduce the potentially strongly and nonlinearly coupled component of the detector as part of the quantum system and only treat the weakly coupled part as an environment . in other words , we single out one prominent degree of freedom of the detector from the rest and treat it on equal footing with the qubit .",
    "this `` special treatment '' of one environmental degree of freedom is an essential point of this approach because it allows us to describe the dynamics of a qubit coupled arbitrarily strong to a non - markovian environment . on the other hand",
    "it enhances the dimension of the hilbert space to be captured .",
    "this technical complication can be handled using a phase space representation of the extra degree of freedom  in our example , a harmonic oscillator .    in section [ section_model ]",
    "we derive the model hamiltonian motivated by ref .  @xcite . for this hamiltonian",
    "we derive in section [ section_method ] a master equation and present a phase space method which enables us to analyze the dynamics of an infinite level system . in section [ section_results ] we demonstrate that our method enables to extract informations about the measurement process of the qubit , such as dephasing and measurement time and also present three different measurement protocols .",
    "we consider a simplified version of the experiment described in ref .",
    "the circuit consists of a flux qubit drawn in the single junction version , the surrounding squid loop , an ac source , and a shunt resistor , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ circuit ] .",
    "we note here that we later approximate the qubit as a two - level system .",
    "the qubit used in the actual experiment contains three junctions .",
    "an analogous but less transparent derivation would , after performing the two - state approximation , lead to the same model , parameterized by the two - state hamiltonian , the circulating current , and the mutual inductance , in an identical way @xcite .    , capacitance @xmath0 and inductance @xmath1 ) inductively coupled to a squid with two identical junctions ( phases @xmath2 , capacitance @xmath3 ) and inductance @xmath4 .",
    "the squid is driven by an ac bias @xmath5 and the voltage drop is measured by a voltmeter with internal resistance @xmath6 . the total flux through the qubit loop is @xmath7 and through the squid is @xmath8 .",
    "]    the measurement process is started by switching on the ac source and monitoring the amplitude and/or phase of the voltage drop across the resistor .",
    "the squid acts as an oscillator whose resonance frequency depends on the state of the qubit . when the measurement is started , the qubit entangles with the resonator an shifts its frequency .",
    "the value of the oscillator frequency relative to the frequency of the ac driving current determines the amplitude and phase of the voltage drop across the resistor .",
    "the detector ( voltmeter ) contains an internal resistor .",
    "this is a dissipative element connecting the quantum mechanical system ( qubit + squid ) to the macroscopic observer .",
    "the resistor is needed for performing the measurement , defined as the transfer of quantum information encoded in a superposition of states to classical information encoded in the probabilities with which the the voltmeter shows certain values , e.g.  voltage amplitude or phase .",
    "note that practically this resistor may be the distributed impedance of the coaxial line connected to the chip .    in this section",
    "we derive an effective hamiltonian for this system .",
    "our starting point is a set of current conservation equations for the circuit of fig .",
    "[ circuit ] .",
    "the total magnetic fluxes through the squid and the qubit loops can be divided into screening @xmath9 fluxes produced through circulating currents and external @xmath10 fluxes from outside sources @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "generally , ampere s law for a system of current loops can be represented in matrix form @xmath13 which can be inverted @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mutual inductance and @xmath16 is the determinant of the inductance matrix @xmath17 .",
    "the circulating current through the squid loop is given by the difference of the currents through the two branches @xmath18 and the bias current is @xmath19 .",
    "the fluxoid quantization @xcite in the two loops reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the magnetic flux quantum for a superconductor . to obtain the equations of motion for the phases",
    "@xmath22 with @xmath23 we start from the current conservation in each node .",
    "@xmath24 here we assume that the two junctions have identical critical currents .",
    "this symmetry , as will be discussed below , has the consequence that at zero bias current through the squid , the qubit will be isolated from its environment . in experiment",
    ", the two squid junction will of course not be identical .",
    "for an asymmetric squid the qubit can be protected from environmental noise @xcite by applying an appropriate dc bias .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ matrix_currents ] ) and ( [ branch12 ] ) for the circulating current , we obtain @xmath25 considering the analogy between josephson junctions and inductors we introduce the josephson inductance @xmath26 and rewrite eq .",

    "( [ circs2 ] ) , ( [ bias ] ) , and ( [ circq ] ) , we observe that @xmath35 , the phase drop across the squid , serves as a pointer : it couples to the qubit degree of freedom @xmath36 and is read out by the classical observer , which appears in the classical equation of motion ( [ bias ] ) as a dissipative term . without bias",
    "current @xmath37 , the classical solution for this degree of freedom becomes @xmath38 independent of the internal degree of freedom @xmath39 and the qubit .",
    "it follows that , in the absence of @xmath40 , there is no coupling between the quantum mechanical system and the environment , as the pointer is decoupled from the observer .",
    "we start the derivation of the system hamiltonian suppressing the dissipative term in eq .",
    "( [ bias ] ) .",
    "it will be later reintroduced in the form of an oscillator bath .",
    "starting from the equations of motion ( [ circs2 ] ) , ( [ bias ] ) , and ( [ circq ] ) , for @xmath41 and @xmath36 we first determine the lagrangian such that @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we introduce the canonically conjugate momenta @xmath44 and @xmath45 and finally derive the hamiltonian using @xmath46 .",
    "this leads to @xmath47 now we proceed to simplify this hamiltonian using the assumptions that @xmath48 , which applies to small squids as the ones used for qubit readout , and that the driving strength is small enough to remain in the harmonic part of the potential @xmath49 . using the latter assumption , we can expand the potential energies to second order around the minimum and obtain two coupled harmonic oscillators ( @xmath35 and @xmath39 ) with greatly different frequencies .",
    "@xmath39 evolves in a much narrower potential ( @xmath50 ) than that of @xmath35 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "therefore we can perform an adiabatic approximation and substitute @xmath39 through its average position .",
    "we obtain the following potential for the remaining degree of freedom @xmath35 @xmath52 in the next step , we perform the two - state approximation of the qubit along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , reducing its dynamics to the two lowest energy eigenstates .",
    "this space is spanned by wave functions centered around two values @xmath53 ( @xmath36 either in the left or the right well of the potential ) .",
    "while the manipulation of the qubit is usually performed at the optimum working point @xcite , the readout can and should be performed in quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement i.e.  in the pure dephasing limit .",
    "this reduces the qubit hamiltonian to @xmath54 . we allow for a significant off - diagonal term @xmath55 to have acted in the past in order to prepare superpositions of eigenstates of @xmath56 .",
    "physically , this situation is achieved by either making one of the qubit junctions tunable , or imposing a huge energy bias to the qubit .",
    "we note here that if , opposed to the case we will discuss in the following , the measurement interaction would not commute with the qubit hamiltonian , a full analysis in terms of quantum measurement theory would be required .",
    "similar to refs .",
    "@xcite the action on the system given by each measurement result would need to be determined in order to quantify the information that the observer can obtain about the initial state of the qubit , as well as the state following the measurement .",
    "after these approximations the qubit - squid hamiltonian reads @xmath57 where @xmath58 corresponds to the external degree of freedom of the squid @xmath35 and @xmath59 originates in the ac driving by a classical field .",
    "the conversion of the parameters to circuit - related quantities can be found in appendix [ apcirc ] .",
    "here @xmath60 is the quadratic frequency shift ( qfs ) .",
    "an important property of this hamiltonian is the absence of the commonly used linear coupling between the two - level system and the harmonic oscillator  @xcite . in our case",
    "the qubit couples to the squared coordinate of the oscillator , which leads to a qubit dependent change in the frequency of the harmonic oscillator instead of the shift of the potential minimum .",
    "because of the coupling to the driven oscillator the qubit energy splitting becomes time - dependent @xmath61 .    to model the dissipation introduced by the resistor",
    "we follow the standard caldeira - leggett approach @xcite and include an oscillator bath to our hamiltonian @xmath62 with @xmath63 @xcite where @xmath64 is the heaviside step function and @xmath65 $ ] the photon loss rate .",
    "the cut - off frequency @xmath66 is physically motivated by the high frequency filter introduced by the capacitors .",
    "our goal is to analyze the resolution and measurement time and investigate the backaction on the qubit .",
    "the former requires tracing over the qubit and discuss the dynamics of the pointer variable of the detector , the latter requires tracing over the detector degrees of freedom .",
    "it is well established how to do this in principle exactly @xcite when the qubit couples to a gaussian variable of the detector ( i.e.  sum of quadratures of the environmental coordinates ) . a method to map a damped harmonic oscillator to bath of uncoupled oscillators with a modified spectral density",
    "@xcite also exists . in our case ,",
    "due to the quadratic coupling between the qubit and the damped oscillator ( [ sysh ] ) , any such normal - mode transform does not lead to the usual gaussian model and thus can not use many of the methods developed for the spin - boson model .",
    "there are several approaches to dealing with this challenge .",
    "as long as the coupling is weak , @xmath67 , one can still linearize the detector dynamics and make a gaussian approximation as it was done in ref .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , weak coupling decoherence theory as reviewed e.g.  in refs .",
    "@xcite builds on two - point correlators and can not distinguish gaussian from non - gaussian environments .    in this work",
    "we describe arbitrarily large couplings between qubit and oscillator going beyond the gaussian approximation .",

    "as long as @xmath37 there is no direct coupling between the qubit and the oscillator in the second order approximation and thus no coupling to the environment .",
    "therefore , at @xmath102 , before one turns on the ac driving , the harmonic oscillator has the frequency @xmath103 independent of the qubit .",

    "resonance the splitting of the peaks is increased by stronger driving .",
    "the discrimination time discussed here is not to be confused with the physical measurement time . in particular , the discrimination time remains finite even at vanishing @xmath68 and when the off - diagonal elements of the full density matrix in qubit space ( [ densityqubit ] ) still have finite norm at this time .",
    "the discrimination time is the time it takes to imprint the qubit state into the oscillator dynamics .",
    "for completing the measurement the oscillator itself needs to be observed by the heat bath and , as a consequence of that observation , the full density matrix will collapse further .",
    "we note that in this kind of sample - and - hold measurement , the qubit spends only the discrimination time in contact with the environment .",
    "keeping the discrimination time short may be of advantage in limiting bit flip errors during detection .",
    "we do not further describe such error processes in this paper .",
    "as a technical limitation , it should be remembered that our theory is based on a markov approximation for the oscillator - bath coupling , hence it is not reliable for discrimination times lower than the bath correlation time .      in this section , we are going to take this idea to the next level and analyze a measurement protocol that is based on extremely short qubit - detector interaction . in refs .",
    "@xcite has been shown that one can measure several field observables through infinitesimal - time probing of the internal states of the coupled qubit . in this section ,",
    "we apply the same idea to the opposite setting .",
    "we show that the information about the state of the qubit is encoded in the expectation value of the momentum of our oscillator at only one point in time , leading to a fast weak measurement scheme .",

    "moreover , it is sufficient to measure the expectation value of momentum , and not the first time derivative .",
    "the reason for this is the oscillator evolution , mediated by the interaction with the qubit , into a state with finite expectation value @xmath204 , in other words the system is automatically creating its own measurement favorable `` initial '' condition .",
    "this is visible in eq .",
    "( [ createinitial ] ) where the part of the signal proportional @xmath205 increases like @xmath206 which , for short times is slower than @xmath93 , as it would be in the case where the favorable initial condition already exists .",

    "again , the read out of the oscillator in the end will be a separate issue and ultimately take a time @xmath207 .    on the other hand , in order to establish the expectation value with sufficient accuracy ,",
    "this scheme requires a large ensemble average . according to the central limit theorem",

    "this reflects the tradeoff between the number of measurements and the signal strength @xmath215 which provides the information about the qubit .      in order to complete the study of the measurement protocols presented in the previous section , we need insight into the measurement bakaction on the qubit .",
    "since we are studying the qnd hamiltonian ( [ sysh ] ) , the qubit decoherence consists only of dephasing .",

    "only the contribution of driving is shown .",
    "we have substracted from each curve the initial value of @xmath220 at @xmath242 .",
    "we observe that the decoherence rate must be of the form @xmath244 for both the weak and strong coupling regime .",
    "this was to be expected since the qubit couples to the squared coordinate which ( at least in the classical case ) is proportional to @xmath245 . in both regimes ,",
    "the driving leads to a contribution to the dephasing rate that is proportional to @xmath68 because the driving leads to classical motion relative to the heat bath , which is fixed in the @xmath58-coordinate space .",
    "this motion enhances the effect of the bath the stronger the friction coefficient @xmath68 is .",
    "consequently , even if in the undriven case the dephasing rate scales as @xmath246 , strong driving can in principle cross it over to a decay rate @xmath247 .",
    "this cross - over from @xmath246 to @xmath68 inside the wqoc regime happens at either _ very _ strong driving or when the driving @xmath180 frequency approaches one of the system resonances @xmath248 .",
    "the dependence on the driving frequency has also been analyzed in fig .",
    "[ antrieb ] . here",
    "we observe two peaks at @xmath249 and @xmath250 . at @xmath251",
    "the classical driven and _",
    "un_damped trajectory @xmath83 diverges . in terms of the calculation",
    "this means that the floquet modes are not well - defined when the driving frequency is at resonance with the harmonic oscillator  we have a continuum instead .",
    "physically this means that at @xmath102 our oscillator has the frequency @xmath103 because it has not yet `` seen '' the qubit , and we are driving it at resonance , and by amplifying the oscillations of @xmath252 which is subject to noise we amplify the noise seen by the qubit .",
    "the dephasing rate is also expected to diverge .",
    "the peaks at @xmath249and @xmath250 show the same effect after the qubit and the oscillator become entangled .",
    "the dephasing rate drops again for large driving frequencies to the value obtained in the case without driving .      in this section",
    "we analyze the measurement times necessary for the measurement protocols described in sections [ ltss ] and [ stss ] and compare them with the dephasing times of the qubit obtained for the same parameters .      for the long time measurement protocol ( section [ ltss ] )",

    "as one can see for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ comp ] , in the wqoc regime the measurement time is longer than the dephasig time .",
    "their difference decreases as we increase @xmath60 due to the onset of the strong coupling plateau in the dephasing rate , approaching the quantum limit where the measurement time becomes comparable to the dephasing time .",
    "note that , for superstrong coupling either between qubit and oscillator or between oscillator and bath , corrections of the order @xmath259 of the dephasing rate gain importance .",
    "these corrections are not treated in our born approximation . therefore the regions where the dephasing rate becomes lower than the measurement rate , in violation with the quantum limitation of ref .",
    "@xcite , should be regarded as a limitation of our approximation .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ comp ] shows the dephasing and measurement times as function of @xmath68 .",
    "again we observe improvement of the ratio of measurement and dephasing time as we increase @xmath60 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the tunning of @xmath68 should be easier to achieve experimentally , we also see that , at given @xmath60 one can make use of the phase purcell effect , which reduces the dephasing rate as @xmath246 while the measurement rate increases like @xmath68 .",
    "this goes along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite where it has been shown that strong @xmath68 implies wqoc , i.e. phase purcell effect .",
    "as already mentioned , for the short time , single shot measurement strong , close to resonance driving is needed for the rapid separation of the peaks . while the discrimination time is not very sensitive to the change of @xmath68 , we observe in fig .",
    "[ shorttime ] that one needs relatively strong coupling ( @xmath260 ) for the discrimination time to become shorter than the decoherence time .",
    "the picture of the dephasing rate is also qualitatively different from the case without driving or with far off - resonant driving , since for @xmath261 , @xmath249 becomes resonant with the driving frequency . in this region",
    "our numerical calculation also becomes unstable .",
    "nevertheless , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ shorttime ] , the dephasing rate is proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "thus , by reducing the damping of the oscillator , one can extend the domain of values of @xmath60 where the measurement can be performed .     and filled symbols : @xmath262 . here",

    "[ probability ] will never be well enough separated to allow a single shot measurement .    in this protocol what we call `` discrimination time '' is actually the time when the system becomes measurable , i.e. one can in principle extract from a single measurement the needed information about the qubit ( and consequently collapse the wave function ) .",
    "we do not further describe this collapse here .",
    "we have presented a phase space theory of the measurement and measurement backaction on a qubit coupled to a dispersive detector .",
    "we have studied the qubit coupled to an complex environment ( weakly damped harmonic oscillator ) with a quadratic coupling , which does not have to be weak .",
    "we solved the problem by considering the prominent degree of freedom of the environment , i.e. the main oscillator as part of the quantum mechanical system and explicitly solving its dynamics . only at the end of the calculation we traced over this last degree of freedom of the environment in order to obtain the qubit dynamics .",
    "we presented three measurement protocols and compared the measurement and decoherence times .",
    "the protocol of section [ ltss ] requires long measurement time , such that the measurement can only be preformed in strong coupling regime , with far off - resonant driving .",
    "the protocol of section [ stss ] has the advantage of short discrimination times compared with the dephasing time , requires strong qubit - oscillator coupling and also close to resonance driving .",
    "both this protocols can be performed as single shot measurement , and thus may be useful as a readout method for the scalable architecture with long range coupling using superconducting flux qubits @xcite .",
    "the quasi - instantaneous measurement protocol of section [ instantan ] has the advantage of the shortest possible discrimination time and no restriction for the qubit - oscillator coupling , with the drawback that one needs to repeat the measurement a large number of times to obtain the momentum expectation value .",
    "we expect our results , with minor adaptations , to be applicable to various cavity systems , e.g. quantum dot or atom - based quantum optical schemes @xcite .",
