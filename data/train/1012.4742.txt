    "this physical situation can be described by the following initial - boundary value problem for heat equation : @xmath1 here @xmath0  the _ heat conductor _  is a bounded domain in the euclidean space @xmath2 @xmath3 with lipschitz boundary and @xmath4 denotes the normalized temperature of the conductor at a point @xmath5 and time @xmath6    a _ hot spot _",

    "the former is somehow reminiscent of the proof of the maximum principle of alexandrov , bakelmann and pucci and of some ideas contained in @xcite , concerning properties of solutions of the monge - amp ` ere equation .",
    "the estimates obtained in this way are applicable to any open bounded set , not necessarily convex .",

    "when @xmath24 is convex , more explicit bounds can be derived ; for instance , the following one relates the distance of @xmath26 from @xmath20 to the inradius and the diameter : @xmath42 where again @xmath43 is a constant depending only on @xmath40 ( see theorem [ th : conv ] for its expression ) .",
    "we point out that the so called _ santal point _ of @xmath24 always satisfies , hence this can also be used to locate such a point ( see section [ sec : polar ] and remark [ santalo ] ) .",
