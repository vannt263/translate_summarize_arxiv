    "investigation of the very early period of the universe requires quantum treatment of gravity  @xcite .",
    "however , because we do not have the complete theory of quantum gravity yet in hand , simplified models with reduced dynamical degrees of freedom have been investigated to understand nature of canonical quantum gravity .",
    "this approach is the mini - superspace quantum cosmology ( a general review of quantum cosmology is given by @xcite ) .",
    "a quantum state of the model is represented by the wave function of the universe , which satisfies the wheeler - dewitt ( wd ) equation derived from the procedure of canonical quantization @xcite .",
    "the wave function of the universe is represented as the path integral by summing over histories of the universe @xcite .    to obtain the wave function of the universe",
    ", we must impose boundary conditions of the wd equation . in the context of the quantum cosmology",
    ", there are two major candidates for the boundary condition , the tunneling proposal by vilenkin @xcite and the no - boundary boundary condition proposal by hartle and hawking @xcite .",
    "the former is given by the wave function only consisting of the outgoing mode at the asymptotic future of mini - superspace , and is analogous to the tunneling wave function in quantum mechanics .",
    "the latter is given by the path integral over euclidean non - singular compact geometries with no - boundary .",
    "the path integral representation of the wave function provides important notions such as analytic continuation of integration contours , complex action and complex euclidean solutions called the fuzzy instantons @xcite .",
    "they play important rolls when we consider semi - classical evaluation of the wave function of the universe based on the saddle point method @xcite .",
    "a choice of the path integral contour corresponds to specifying a boundary condition of the wd equation @xcite . to predict the classical universe using quantum cosmology , we must derive a probability for classical observables from the wave function of the universe .",
    "the number of e - foldings of inflation is often used as a predictable observable and recent observational restriction requires this number must be greater than about 60 .",
    "the amount of e - foldings predicted by quantum cosmology depends on models and boundary conditions .",
    "thus , the main issue in quantum cosmology is to determine which type of boundary conditions are preferable to explain observational results .",
    "recent applications of quantum cosmology to various cosmological models are studied in papers @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we apply a numerical method to obtain predictions from wave functions of the universe .",
    "the main idea of our research is to represent boundary conditions of the wave function using exact solutions of the wd equation with a constant scalar field potential .",
    "this makes our problem of determining boundary conditions as the parameter estimation in space of boundary conditions .",
    "we aim to obtain a probability distribution of boundary conditions under the constraint of sufficient e - foldings of the inflation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce a mini - superspace model and review derivaton of the probability for classical universes from the wave function of the universe . in section iii , we introduce a parametrization of boundary conditions and define the probability for boundary conditions . details of our numerical simulations and their results",
    "are explained in section iv .",
    "section v is devoted to summary and conclusion .",
    "we use the unit in which @xmath0 throughout the paper .",

    "dynamical variables are the scale factor @xmath13 and the inflaton field @xmath14 .",
    "we represent them as coordinates of configuration space @xmath15 this configuration space is called mini - superspace .",

    "it yields the wheeler - dewitt equation @xmath23\\psi(q,\\phi)=0,\\quad v(\\phi)\\equiv   \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{\\mu^2}{2}\\phi^2.\\label{eq : wdwq0}\\ ] ] in terms of @xmath24 , @xmath25\\psi(q)=0,\\quad      u=-\\frac{1}{2}+qv ,      \\label{eq : wdwq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is a metric of mini - superspace .",
    "the wave function @xmath22 on mini - superspace is called the wave function of the universe .",
    "although there is an operator ordering ambiguity in the quantization procedure , we choose the ordering which yields the equation ( [ eq : wdwq0 ] ) in our analysis .",
    "the wave function @xmath27 can also be expressed by the path integral with respect to @xmath24 and @xmath6 : @xmath28 } , \\quad   s[n(\\lambda),q^a(\\lambda)]=\\int_0 ^ 1d\\lambda\\,\\mathcal{l}[n(t),q^a(t)].\\ ] ] here , @xmath29 is a boundary value of @xmath24 on the final spacelike hypersurface @xmath30 .",
    "the path integral representation of the wave function satisfies eq .",
    "@xcite . in our approach to the quantum cosmology , we mainly focus on solving ( [ eq : wdwq0 ] ) as a differential equation but the path integral representation plays an important roll in characterizing boundary conditions for the wave function .        to extract predictions for the classical universe from the wave function , it must be expressed as the semi - classical form , which means the wave function behaves as the wkb solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wdwq0 ] ) .",
    "we perform the wkb expansion of the wave function as @xmath31 for convergence of the path integral representation of the wave function , the contour of the path integral must be analytically continued in the complex plane .",
    "thus , @xmath32 and @xmath33 would generally become complex functions .",
    "we write @xmath32 as @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are real functions .",
    "we call @xmath37 as a pre - factor and @xmath38 as a phase of the wave function .    inserting into the wd equation",
    ", we obtain a set of semi - classical equations for @xmath39 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "now , we consider a condition of the wave function to provide predictions for the classical universe . in the classical regime ,",
    "the phase of the wave function must satisfies the hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "this implies that the equation corresponds to the hamilton - jacobi equation in the classical regime .",
    "namely , @xmath42 should reduce to the classical hamiltona - jacobi equation @xmath43 thus @xmath35 and @xmath36 should satisfy the condition @xmath44 this inequality is called the `` classicality '' condition  @xcite . to predict the evolution of classical universes from the wave function , @xmath45 and @xmath33 must satisfy ( [ eq : order1])-([eq : classic ] ) and we expect that the probability can be obtained in the region of mini - superspace where the classicality condition is satisfied .    in the path integral representation of the wave function",
    ", there are more than one saddle point of the action in general .",
    "thus , the semi - classical wave function is given by superposition of wkb components associated with different saddle points : @xmath46 it is possible to obtain a desirable probability measure for the classical universe using this expression of the wkb wave function .",
    "now let us consider how to define probability from the wave function .",
    "introducing probability from the wave function of the universe is not straightforward because the wd equation is the klein - gordon type and its conserved charge is not positive definite .",
    "however , by considering the classicality condition , it is possible to introduce a suitable probability measure and we can define the conditional probability giving predictions for observables . for the wave function @xmath27 satisfying the wd equation , we have the following conserved current in mini - superspace @xmath47 in the classical region where the wave function has the wkb form , we can obtain the positive definite probability measure from @xmath48 . for each wkb components of the wave function",
    ", we define @xmath49 they are conserved independently in the classical region @xmath50 . from the hamilton - jacobi equation , we can assign the canonical momentum in the classical region @xmath51 here , we focus only on the components with @xmath52 . from @xmath53 ,",
    "these components correspond to expanding universes .",
    "thus , we can introduce a conserved current corresponding to expanding universes as @xmath54 let us consider a surface @xmath55 in mini - superspace which is spacelike with respect to the metric @xmath56 and has a unit normal @xmath57 .",
    "we require the classicality condition is satisfied on this surface .",
    "then the relative probability @xmath58 of classical histories passing through this surface is given by the component of the conserved current along the normal if it is positive . in the leading order in @xmath59 ,",
    "this is @xmath60 where @xmath61 means differentiation along the normal vector @xmath57 . as a point on @xmath55",
    "is specified by the value of the scalar field , @xmath62 provides the probability for the inflaton field to realize a value @xmath7 on @xmath55 .",
    "we can derive a probability for observables from the probability measure @xmath63 .",
    "it can be given as the conditional probability @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a subset of the hypersurface @xmath55 defined by some theoretical constraints and @xmath66 is a subset of @xmath65 defined by restricting @xmath65 using observational constraints . by using the relation ,",
    "we can obtain classical trajectories starting from @xmath55 .",
    "namely , the probability measure on @xmath55 with the classicality condition gives probability distribution of initial data @xmath67 for the classical equation of motion . in our analysis , the number of e - foldings @xmath68 is adopted as an observable because this variable quantifies the inflationary models to explain the horizon and the flatness problems .",
    "@xmath68 is defined by @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the beginning time of inflation and @xmath71 denotes the end time of inflation . in our analysis",
    ", we define @xmath71 as the end time of inflation driven by the scalar field potential .",
    "the number of e - foldings @xmath68 is determined by the initial data and it is possible to translate the probability measure for @xmath7 on @xmath55 to the probability measure for @xmath72 .    to introduce the conditional probability , we define an interval @xmath65 as @xmath73 $ ] where @xmath74 is the lower bound of the interval and @xmath75 is the value of the inflaton field corresponding to the planck energy density @xmath76",
    ". then an interval @xmath77 is defined as @xmath78 $ ] where @xmath79 corresponds to the number of e - foldings @xmath80 consistent with observations .",
    "accordingly , the conditional probability to predict the universe with sufficient inflation becomes @xmath81 we denote this probability as @xmath82 the expectation value of @xmath68 can be calculated as @xmath83 these probability and expectation value depend not only on cosmological models but also on boundary conditions of the wave function . as we have already commented in the introduction ,",
    "there are two well known proposals for the boundary condition of the wave function .",
    "one of them is `` no - boundary boundary condition proposal '' by hartle and hawking ( hh ) , the other one is `` tunneling proposal '' by vilenkin ( v ) .",
    "they predict different evolution of universe ; ( hh ) prefers small value of @xmath68 , on the other hands , ( v ) prefers large value of @xmath68 . by calculating and comparing @xmath84 for given models and",
    "given boundary conditions , we can evaluate what type of models and boundary conditions are more suitable to explain observation of our universe .",
    "when we have some restriction on our models of inflationary universe from observations , we can investigate a probability which states preferable type of boundary conditions .",
    "it is possible to express this probability using bayes theorem : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a probability for @xmath87 under @xmath36 happened . here",
    ", @xmath87 is some candidate of a boundary condition of the wave function labeled by index @xmath88 , and @xmath36 means the universe with sufficient inflation , namely , @xmath89 .",
    "thus , @xmath86 denotes the probability for @xmath87 under the sufficiently inflated universe . on the contrary ,",
    "@xmath90 in the right hand side is the probability for sufficient inflation under the boundary condition @xmath87 and is equivalent to @xmath84 defined in the previous section @xmath91 as we do not have any information on the prior probability @xmath92 , we assume that it is uniformly distributed . to represent different boundary conditions , we will introduce two parameters @xmath93 in .",
    "the probability for the parameters @xmath93 is given by @xmath94    when we solve the wd equation , we have to impose some boundary condition ( in other words , initial condition ) on the wave function . for this purpose ,",
    "we use exact solutions of the wd equation which are obtained when the scalar field potential @xmath95 is constant .",
    "based on the path integral representation of the wave function , for the constant scalar field potential case , the wave function corresponding to the no - boundary ( hartle - hawking ) and the tunneling ( vilenkin ) type boundary conditions are expressed as  @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 with @xmath98 for large values of the scale factor ( classical region ) , @xmath99 is superposition of expanding and contracting universes with amplitude @xmath100 which prefers small values of the potential . on the other hand , @xmath101 represents an expanding universe with amplitude @xmath102 which prefers large values of the potential .",
    "we can express more general type of wave functions introducing two real parameters @xmath93 which represent boundary conditions of the wave function @xmath103 introduced parameters @xmath93 distinguish boundary conditions of the wave function ( table  [ ta : wave ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : parabc ] ) .",

    "[ fig : p_ab_mu ] ) , @xmath108 has large values on lines @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "these two lines correspond to the wave functions @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath108 has small values on the line @xmath113 , corresponding to @xmath114 and @xmath99 .",
    "consequently , @xmath101 is more preferable than @xmath99 to realize large e - foldings , and this result is the same as one predicted by the wave functions for a constant scalar field potential .",
    "in contrast to that , in the case of @xmath115 ( right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : p_ab_mu ] ) , @xmath108 has large values only around the point @xmath116 , which corresponds to the boundary wave function @xmath111 .",
    "this behavior is significantly different from the case of @xmath107 ( see table  [ ta : pab ] ) .",
    "superiority of @xmath101 to @xmath99 holds both @xmath107 and @xmath115 models .",
    "we expect our results with parameter @xmath107 and @xmath115 are typical ones and @xmath108 with @xmath117 behaves similar to @xmath107 case and @xmath108 with @xmath118 behaves similar to @xmath115 case .",
    "in this paper , we considered boundary conditions for the wave function of the universe which lead to sufficient e - foldings of inflation .",
    "for this purpose , we adopted the exact solutions of the wd equation with a constant scalar field potential as the boundary condition of the wave function , and solved the wd equation numerically .",
    "this boundary condition is parametrized with two real parameters and includes both the tunneling and the no - boundary boundary conditions .",
    "we obtained the probability distribution function for these parameters under the condition of sufficient e - foldings of inflation .",
    "the parameters with large value of this probability determines the boundary condition of the wave function which predicts sufficient e - foldings of inflation .",
    "we found that the probability distribution of boundary conditions has two different behavior depending on the value of model parameter @xmath8 .    for small values of @xmath8 ,",
    "the cosmological constant dominates and the inflaton field asymptotically approaches to zero without oscillation . in this case ,",
    "@xmath7 dependence of the wave function is not so strong and the obtained wave function reproduces behavior of exact wave functions with a constant scalar field potential .",
    "hence the probability of boundary conditions has large values for @xmath119 and small values for @xmath120 .",
    "thus , boundary conditions @xmath119 are preferable to realize sufficient period of inflation and superiority among them is small .",
    "this behavior of the probability of boundary conditios can be expected from behavior of wave functions for a constant scalar field potential . on the other hand , for large values of @xmath8 , the slow roll inflation",
    "is followed by oscillation of the inflaton field . in this case , the derivative term of @xmath7 in the wd equation can not be neglected and wave functions have large values about @xmath121 for any boundary conditions . owing to this behavior of the wave function , the probability of boundary conditions has large value about @xmath111 ( superiority of @xmath122 over @xmath123 is kept as before ) .",
    "thus , realistic inflationary models followed by oscillation of inflaton field select the boundary condition @xmath111 .    as an extention of analysis presented in this paper ,",
    "it is also possible to discuss probability for values of the model parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the probability distribution of boundary conditions has a sharp peak for the model with large @xmath8 and selects a specific boundary condition .",
    "this implies that a suitable boundary condition is automatically chosen for large values of @xmath8 ( small values of the cosmological constant ) . if we assume that the probability of boundary conditions select an unique boundary condition , the parameter @xmath8 must acquire large value ( the cosmological constant must be small ) . to confirm this expectation , we should analyse behaviour of the probability of boundary conditions for wider range of the parameter @xmath8 and we will report on this subject in a separate publication .    we would like to thank meguru komada for introducing us basic concept of bayesian inference .",
