    "in recent years , significant progress has been made in understanding the semiclassical basis of universality in quantum chaos . in a sequence of steps",
    "@xcite , the theory of action correlations and periodic orbits has advanced to a stage , where the full information stored in the spectral correlation functions of random matrix theory ( rmt ) has become accessible by semiclassical methods .",
    "an important element in this development has been the establishment of a cross - link between semiclassics and the so - called zero dimensional sigma model ( which in turn had long been known  @xcite to be in one - to - one correspondence to rmt ) : under conditions of global hyperbolicity and for low energies ( energies lower than the inverse @xmath1 of the so - called ehrenfest time , @xmath2 ) , individual contributions to the semiclassical expansion of spectral correlation functions become fully universal in that they depend on combinatorics and topology of the underlying orbit correlations , but not on system specific details .",
    "each such term has a corresponding contribution to the loop expansion of the zero dimensional sigma model around one of its saddle points . from a certain perspective , the semiclassical analysis of spectral correlations has , thus , been tantamount to a reduction of the full microscopic information stored in the green functions of an individual chaotic system down to the core data encapsulated in the zero dimensional sigma model .    in this paper , we discuss an alternative reduction scheme , which is similar in spirit , but methodologically different .",
    "our starting point will be the observation that the zero dimensional @xmath0-model affords an alternative interpretation , viz . as the globally uniform mean field limit of the ballistic @xmath0-model .",
    "the ballistic @xmath0-model in its variant considered here is an effective field theory of chaotic systems , obtained from a microscopic parent theory  @xcite by projection onto the sector of fields fluctuating on length scales @xmath3 .",
    "we will present various arguments to the effect that this projection captures the essential physics of the problem .",
    "the resulting effective field theory is defined on shells of conserved energy in classical phase space .",
    "its dynamics is controlled by the  equally classical  liouville operator .",
    "quantum mechanics enters the theory through a feature known as non - commutativity. in practice , non - commutativity implies that points in phase space can be defined only up to a maximal resolution set by the planck cell .",
    "( notice that the typical linear extensions of planck cells are of @xmath4 , much bigger than the cutoff length of the theory . ) below we will explore the conspiracy of classical hyperbolicity and planck cell resolution in the long time dynamics of chaotic systems .    specifically , we will show that a perturbative expansion of the model leads to structures that are remarkably similar , if not equivalent , to those arising in periodic orbit theory : taking the first quantum correction to the spectral correlation function ( the sieber - richter term  @xcite ) as an example , we will recover information on the phase space available to individual families of periodic orbits , and the corresponding action correlations .",
    "the actual integrals describing these corrections turn out to be identical to those of periodic orbit theory .",
    "this finding suggests a quantitative identification of the feynman diagrams of the theory with the action - correlated orbit pairs of semiclassical analysis ( however , an extension of the calculation to higher orders in perturbation theory , necessary to substantiate this claim , is beyond the scope of the present paper . )    going beyond perturbation theory , we will demonstrate that for correlation energies smaller than the inverse of the ehrenfest time non - uniform fluctuations in phase space are effectively suppressed .",
    "the resulting theory of uniform fluctuations ( viz . the zero dimensional @xmath0-model ) predicts universal behavior , in agreement with the predictions of rmt .",
    "field theory thus provides a comparatively simple way of understanding the basis of the bohigas - gianonni - schmid  @xcite universality hypothesis , alternative to the explicit summation over infinite hierarchies of periodic orbits  @xcite .",
    "the computational efficiency of the mean field plus fluctuations approach to universality arguably represents the most important advantage of the present formalism .",

    "[ sec : universal - limit ] and [ sec : pert - equiv - semicl ] , repsectively , we explore the field theory approach to universality , and the connections to periodic orbit theory .",
