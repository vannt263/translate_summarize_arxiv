    "the recently released data of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) confirmed the earlier cobe - dmr s observation about the deficiency in fluctuation power at the largest angular scales  @xcite .",

    "it implies that the initial density perturbations are significantly suppressed on scales equal to or larger than the hubble radius .",
    "models of structure formation with a cut - off power spectrum of perturbation on large scales provide a better fit to the cmb temperature fluctuations .",
    "the most likely cut - off wavelength derived from the wmap data  @xcite actually is the same as that determined by the cobe - dmr  @xcite .",
    "the super - horizon suppression is difficult to make compatible with models which produce pure adiabatic ( isentropic ) perturbations .",
    "however , it might be explained if the perturbations are hybrid .",
    "the different behavior of adiabatic and isocurvature ( entropic ) perturbations around the horizon scale can be used to construct power spectra with a super - horizon suppression .",
    "the wmap data show not only a possible non - zero fraction of isocurvature fluctuations in the primordial density perturbations , also the correlation between the adiabatic and the isocurvature components  @xcite . these results then turn into the constraints on the multi - component inflationary models , as the initial perturbations generated from these models are principally hybrid  @xcite .",
    "the double and multi - field models have been extensively studied in this context  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will investigate the hybrid perturbations created by an inflation with thermal dissipation , the warm inflation scenario  @xcite . in the scheme of the thermal dissipative inflation",
    "the universe contains a scalar field and a thermal bath during the inflation era .",
    "the two components are coupled via the thermal dissipation .",
    "in addition to fitting the amplitude and the power law index of the power spectrum given by the cobe data  @xcite , the thermal dissipative inflation leads to a super - horizon suppression of the perturbations by a factor @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been found that the warm inflation of a spontaneous symmetry breaking potential with strong dissipation is capable of accommodating a running spectral index @xmath10 of the primordial perturbations , and generally yields @xmath11 on large scales and @xmath12 on small scales  @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is to study the fractional power of the isocurvature perturbations , as well as the cross correlation between the adiabatic and the isocurvature fluctuations in the thermal dissipative inflationary model .",
    "in contrast to a single or a double field inflations , the evolution of the universe in the thermal dissipative inflation does not need a stage of non - thermal post - inflationary reheating .",
    "as long as the damping coefficent @xmath3 satisfies the criterion given in  @xcite , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , and @xmath4 stand for the planck energy , the energy scale , and the hubble expansion of the inflaton respectively , the dissipation is effective enough to make the temperature of the radiation component increase continuously during the inflationary epoch .",
    "the universe would eventually enter the radiation - dominated phase when the temperature is high enough so that the radiation component prevails .",
    "since the evolution of entropy only depends upon the thermal dissipative process during inflation , the entropic perturbations are not contaminated by the entropy production in the reheating stage .",
    "therefore , the primordial hybrid perturbations induced by the thermal dissipation can be calculated unambiguously .",
    "the dynamical background of the thermal dissipative inflation model has been investigated within the framework of quantum field theory .",
    "it has been shown that the dissipation may amount to the coupling of the inflaton to a large number of particle species  @xcite . in this sense , the two - field model and the thermal dissipation model can be considered as two extremes among multi - component inflations .",
    "the former adds one more field to the single inflaton , while the later has a large number of additional fields .",
    "the adiabatic and the isocurvature perturbations in the thermal dissipative model have been estimated in @xcite . yet",
    ", these calculations are not immune from the problems induced by gauge issues which are crucial for thermal dissipative perturbations  @xcite . in particular when interactions between the inflaton and the thermal bath are substantial",
    ", the commonly used adiabatic / isocurvature decomposition is not gauge - independent on the ground of super - horizon .",
    "therefore , we must take a full relativistic treatment to analyze the evolution of the hybrid perturbations generated in the thermal dissipative inflation",
    ". moreover , the fluctuations of the radiation component have not been carefully considered in previous works .",
    "although the energy fluctuations of the radiation component are always less than that of the inflaton field , they are not negligible in examining the relative phase between the adiabatic and the isocurvature perturbations .",

    "ii we introduce the thermal dissipative inflationary model in relativistic covariant form .",
    "the initial adiabatic - to - isocurvature ratio is given in  iii .",
    "iv presents a full relativistic calculation on the super - horizon evolution of adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations .",
    "the numerical result of the spectrum of the adiabatic - to - isocurvature ratio is also given in ",
    "we then summarize our findings in  v. the appendices provide the necessary details of the relativistic theory of linear perturbations .",
    "we consider a universe consisting of a scalar inflaton field @xmath15 , and a radiation component which mimics the thermal bath . the total energy - momentum tensor is @xmath16 where subscripts @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively for the scalar field and the radiation , and the latin indices run from 1 to 4 .",

    "the lagrangian is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a self - interaction potential .",

    "the total energy - momentum conservation of the system is governed by @xmath44 the interactions between the @xmath15 field and the thermal bath are characterized by the force vectors defined as @xmath45 obviously , we have @xmath46    the interaction term @xmath47",

    "numerical solutions to ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) have shown the smooth transition  @xcite .",
    "this feature is critical for calculating the primordial entropic fluctuations because the initial perturbations will be unaffected by the large scale post - inflationary entropic process , such as the reheating .",
    "the initial perturbations of the @xmath15 field is calculated by the linearly perturbed field equation upon the space - time background ( 15 ) . because the primordial fluctuations are produced well within the hubble radius",

    "in super - horizon regions , physical quantities should be expressed in a gauge - independent fashion .",
    "however , the adiabatic / isocurvature decomposition of perturbations shown in the last section are not gauge - independent , i.e. either eqs.(40 ) or ( 41 ) are not gauge invariant variables . as usual  @xcite",

    "as shown in appendix c , a gauge invariant ( gi ) variable @xmath136 can be defined as @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the perturbed variable of 3-space curvature [ see eq .",

    "instead , one should decompose the super hubble perturbations into the adiabatic and the modified isocurvature modes .",
    "the initial condition and the evolution of the modified entropic perturbation outside the horizon can then be described unambiguously by the equations of @xmath140 in the ucg .",

    "this is largely due to the coexistence of two components , the radiation and the @xmath15 field , during the inflationary epoch .",
    "the evolution of the density perturbation of radiation and that of the @xmath15 field on scales larger than horizon are governed by different equations ( d3 ) and ( d7 ) .",
