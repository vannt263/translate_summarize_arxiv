    "we are investigating whether or not interacting but not yet merging galaxies have heightened star formation properties . in our spitzer spirals , bridges , and tails interacting galaxy study ( @xcite ) ,",
    "we have compiled a sample of interacting galaxies selected from the arp atlas of peculiar galaxies @xcite .",
    "we have previously presented a detailed study of one of these galaxies , arp 107 , in @xcite . in the current proceeding",
    "we investigate a second system , the interacting pair arp 82 ( ngc 2535/6 ) @xcite .",
    "we have obtained uv , visible , and ir images of arp 82 from galex , sara , and spitzer telescopes respectively .",
    "figure 1 displays various images of arp 82 .",
    "the top left is a galex far - uv image with the 26 clumps identified .",
    "the northern galaxy is ngc 2535 and southern galaxy is ngc 2536 .",
    "the top right image in figure 1 is arp 82 in the spitzer irac 3.6 @xmath0 m band with h@xmath1 contours from the sara telescope .",
    "the bottom left image in figure 1 is arp 82 in the spitzer irac 8 @xmath0 m band with sara h@xmath1 contours .",
    "the tail is more prominent in the uv than in the ir while the center is much less prominent .",
    "note that there are fuv and 8 @xmath0 m clumps in the tail region that are not seen in h@xmath1 .",
    "the star forming regions at 8 @xmath0 m and in the fuv are more prominent than at 3.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "the bottom right image in figure 1 is a snapshot of a smooth particle hydrodynamics model of the gas in red and old stars in blue .",
    "this image shows arp 82 about 1 gyr after the initial closest approach .",
    "the dotted curve shows the companion s passage .",
    "the orbit is nearly planar .",
    "the long duration is needed to allow particles to propagate out to the large distances observed .",
    "four individual plots are seen in figure 2 .",
    "the top left plots the galex fuv / nuv distribution .",
    "a starburst99 @xcite stellar population synthesis model reddened with e(b - v)=0.0(blue ) , 0.2(green ) , and 0.6(red ) mag according to the @xcite reddening law is shown at the top of the histogram .",
    "selected ages are marked .",
    "the top axis is in magnitudes .",
    "most of the clumps have an e(b - v ) between 0.2 and 0.6 mag and ages @xmath2 myr while a few clumps may be @xmath3 myr .",
    "we have determined the star formation rate ( sfr ) for the clumps using two independent methods .",
    "first , we estimated them from the l(ir ) using the calibration in @xcite .",
    "the clumps have a total sfr@xmath4 of @xmath5 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 .",
    "second , we estimated the sfr from the l@xmath8(fuv ) using the uv sfr calibration in @xcite .",
    "the total sfr@xmath9 of the clumps is @xmath10 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 , in good agreement with the sfr@xmath4 .",
    "no reddening correction has been applied to the l@xmath8(fuv ) .",
    "the top right plot in figure 2 shows the star formation rate ( sfr ) versus distance from ngc 2536 .",
    "the red symbols are the sfr determined from l(ir ) and the blue symbols are the sfr determined from l@xmath8(fuv ) .",
    "the open boxes represent clumps in ngc 2536 , x s represent clumps in the bridge region , stars represent clumps in the spiral ( ngc 2535 ) region , and filled boxes represent clumps in the tail region .",
    "the top axis is in arcseconds .    from this figure",
    "it can be seen that the sfr is greatest in the spiral region of ngc 2535 and in ngc 2536 , with much less star formation in the bridge and tail regions .",
    "it can also be seen that the sfr s of clumps in the bridge and tail regions have much better agreement than do the sfr s of clumps in ngc 2536 and the spiral regions . in most cases",
    "the sfr@xmath9 is greater than the sfr@xmath4 .",
    "if an extinction correction were applied to the l@xmath8(fuv ) the sfr@xmath9 would be greater and the agreement with sfr@xmath4 would be worse .",
    "the clumps in the bridge and tail regions account for about 7% of the total clump sfr@xmath4 , while the 2 clumps in the small companion , ngc 2536 , and the 2 largest clumps in the spiral region of ngc 2535 ( # 13 and # 16 ) make up about 42% of the total clump sfr@xmath4 .",
    "the sfr@xmath4 of the entire arp 82 system is 1.2 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 , while the entire system sfr@xmath9 is 2.7 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 .",
    "the total clump sfr@xmath4 accounts for about 36% of the entire system sfr@xmath4 .",
    "the bottom left graph in figure 2 plots the irac [ 4.5]@xmath11[5.8 ] vs [ 3.6]@xmath11[4.5 ] colors of the clumps .",
    "the data symbols are the same as above .",
    "also included in this figure are the predicted irac colors for interstellar dust @xcite , the sloan digitized sky survey quasars in the spitzer wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ) elais n1 field @xcite , and the colors of m iii stars from m. cohen ( 2005 , private communication ) and field stars from @xcite .",
    "the quasars have redshifts between 0.5 and 3.65 ; since their spectral energy distributions are power laws , their infrared colors do not vary much with redshift . from these figures",
    ", it can be seen that clumps # 23 and # 26 have colors consistent with those of quasars and field stars respectively and may not be part of arp 82 .",
    "most of the clumps have [ 4.5]@xmath11[5.8 ] colors between those of the ism and stars , indicating contributions from both to this color .",
    "clumps # 24 and # 25 , which are in the northern tail , have colors similar to those of ism ( but with large uncertainties ) .",
    "thus these appear to be very young star formation regions with little underlying old stellar population .",
    "the bottom right graph in figure 2 plots the irac [ 4.5]@xmath11[5.8 ] color vs distance from ngc 2536 . the data symbols and horizontal axis",
    "are the same as above . from this plot",
    "it can be seen that clumps in the bridge and tail regions seem to have different relative ages than those in the spiral region .",
    "the [ 4.5]@xmath11[5.8 ] colors are generally very red ( i.e. , very ` starbursty ' ) , except for the two low s / n clumps in the tail , # 23 and # 26 .",
    "this work is based in part on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under contract with nasa .",
    "galex is a nasa small explorer mission , developed in cooperation with the centre national detudes spatiales of france and the korean ministry of science and technology .",
