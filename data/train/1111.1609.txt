    "in symbolic dynamics one studies subshifts of the so - called full shift over a finite alphabet @xmath0 ; the latter is the @xmath1-action given by the left shift @xmath2 on the set of infinite sequences with values in @xmath0 and a subshift is the restriction of this dynamical system to a closed shift invariant subspace @xmath3 . among the fields of interest",
    "are the combinatorial properties of such subshifts .",
    "the most prominent combinatorial properties occurring in the literature are recurrence and its stronger variant linear recurrence , repulsiveness which is equivalent to bounded powers ( also referred to as power freeness ) , richness , and various forms of complexity .",
    "such combinatorial properties often correspond to properties of the dynamical system and hence of the @xmath4-algebras @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",

    "a series of works has been devoted to metric spaces @xcite or more specifically to fractals @xcite and cantor sets @xcite .",
    "in particular , for ultrametric cantor sets the work of pearson & bellissard @xcite can be regarded as a mile stone .",
    "they introduced and emphasized the importance of choice functions .    in recent work @xcite , two of the authors proposed a modification of pearson & bellissard s triple obtaining in particular a characterization of the combinatorial property of bounded powers for subshifts with a unique right - special word per length .",
    "a subshift has bounded powers if its sequences do not contain arbitrarily high powers of words , _",
    "i.e. _ there is an integer @xmath10 such that @xmath11-fold repetitions @xmath12 of a word @xmath13 can not occur for @xmath14 .",
    "note that linearly recurrent subshifts , which are commonly regarded as highly ordered @xcite , share this property .",
    "a subshift has a unique right - special word per length if , for each @xmath11 , there exists a unique word of length @xmath11 which can be extended to the right in more than one way to a word of length @xmath15 .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to generalize this characterization of bounded powers to the whole class of minimal and aperiodic subshifts .",
    "the essential ingredient in the construction of @xcite is a family of graphs which approximate the subshift : its vertices are dense and its edges encode adjacencies .",
    "each graph gives rise to spectral triple and its associated connes distance , and taking extrema over the family yields two metrics on the subshift space .",
    "the result is then that the subshift has bounded powers if and only if the two metrics are lipschitz equivalent . the generalization to all subshifts given in the present work",
    "is based on the use of _ a priori _ different approximation graphs .",
    "these are obtained by trading right - special words , which played a decisive role for the old graphs , against what we call here _",
    "privileged words_.    privileged words are iterated complete first returns to letters of the alphabet .",

    "i.e.  without any knowledge of the abstract theory .",
    "this is the case here and so we present our construction _ ad hoc _ and add a final section in which we explain the spectral triples underlying it .",

    "we explain bounded powers and repulsiveness , we introduce _ privileged words _ and explain their relation to palindromes ( proposition  [ pf11.prop-icr ] ) , and define subshifts of _ almost finite ranks_.    section  [ pf11.sect-treegraph ] is devoted to the construction of the approximation graphs . for that we first recall the definition of the _ tree of words _",
