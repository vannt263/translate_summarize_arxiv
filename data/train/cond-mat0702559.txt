    "the heavy fermion materials have been one of the most challenging problems for the condensed matter community in the last three decades .",
    "the physics of these systems is dominated by the competition of many interactions , manifesting in a variety of phases@xcite .",
    "close to the zero - temperature transition between two such phases the materials typically show non - fermi liquid behavior on a large temperature range .",
    "this behavior has been often attributed to an underlying quantum critical point ( qcp ) .    in a subclass of these materials ( including cecu@xmath1au@xmath2 , ybrh@xmath3si@xmath3 and ce@xmath4in@xmath5 , with @xmath4=ir , co , rh ) it is possible to drive the system from an antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase to a paramagnetic ( pm ) phase by suppressing continuously the nel temperature via application of pressure , magnetic field or doping . the conventional spin - density wave ( sdw )",
    "theory of a qcp@xcite disagrees with the experimental evidence in many of these materials@xcite .",
    "this has triggered a renewed interest in microscopic descriptions of the heavy fermion state and its possible instabilities to ordered states . more generally , not only the critical point but also the formation of the heavy fermion state in the regime where the rkky interactions are sizeable requires nontrivial techniques for its microscopic description @xcite .",
    "heavy fermion materials can be modeled by the periodic anderson model which describes a wide conduction band of @xmath6 electrons and a narrow band of @xmath0 electrons which is strongly correlated and hybridized with the @xmath6 electrons .",
    "doniach@xcite established that for large hybridization the @xmath0 electrons combine with the conduction electrons to form a heavy fermi liquid , while for small hybridization the @xmath0 moments order magnetically and hence do not undergo the kondo effect .",
    "thus , changes in the hybridization not only lead to the appearance of magnetic long range order but introduce also a change in the electronic structure referred to as @xmath7 decoupling or kondo breakdown ( kb ) .",
    "namely , for large values of the hybridization the quasiparticles are composites of @xmath0 electrons and conduction @xmath8 electrons with a fermi surface which obeys luttinger theorem , counting both the @xmath0 and @xmath8 electrons . for small hybridization",
    "the @xmath0 electrons decouple from the conduction electron quasiparticles , and the fermi surface contains only the latter .",
    "the decoupling between the @xmath0 and @xmath8 electrons can be viewed as an orbitally selective mott transition , and has been studied with single site dmft@xcite and slave boson techniques@xcite . as stressed in @xcite , a precise formulation of kb requires the elimination of antiferromagnetic long range order which breaks the translational symmetry of the original lattice .",
    "so far this has been achieved by studying models with disorder within dmft@xcite , or by modifying the symmetry group of the spin from su(2 ) to su(n)@xcite . for earlier studies of the kb using slave bosons",
    "see @xcite .",
    "single site extended dmft of various models have been carried out .",
    "for the anderson lattice model@xcite , the kb and the onset of af should be viewed as distinct instabilities which occur at two different values of the rkky coupling ( relative to the kondo coupling ) .",
    "the same situation occurs in the field theory approach of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , extended dmft studies of a kondo lattice model , in which the conduction electron band is constrained so as to prevent its magnetic polarization , reveal that the kb and the onset of magnetism take place at the same point in the phase diagram@xcite .",
    "see however ref.@xcite .",
    "justification for the study of this model is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "in dmft based approaches the breakdown of fermi liquid theory at the transition is understood in terms of local physics .",
    "in other works the same breakdown is explained in terms of the coupling of the electrons to the long wave length fluctuations of an emergent gauge field@xcite and to the kondo order parameter fluctuations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we handle the competition between magnetism and formation of a heavy pm state in an unbiased way using cellular dynamical mean field theory ( cdmft)@xcite .",
    "this approach improves the treatment of non - local correlations over single - site dmft considering a cluster of sites and providing a self - consistency condition on the cluster action .",
    "all the correlations whose range is contained within the cluster are then treated beyond a simple mean - field level . in this paper",
    "we consider a cluster of two sites embedded in a three dimensional lattice , which is the minimal unit able to capture the competition between pm and af correlations .",
    "a similar approach was introduced in an earlier publication@xcite based on a quantum monte carlo impurity solver , but that study was limited to large temperatures and small values of @xmath9 .",
    "we overcome this limitation by using exact diagonalization ( ed ) as an impurity solver@xcite .",
    "this solver gives access to the ground state properties of the system with a finite energy resolution ( typically 0.005 of the bandwidth in our case ) .",
    "in the theory of the mott transition , the investigation of the pm insulating phase has been very fruitful and allowed an understanding of the finite temperature state , above the magnetic order in many compounds .",
    "we pursue a similar approach to the periodic anderson model by investigating both the magnetic and a `` parent compound '' pm state , to understand better the character of the electronic structure .",
    "this allows us to describe the magnetic state as a result of an additional instability of the pm state .",
    "we show that a phase transition separates the heavy fermion paramagnetic phase from an antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "approaching the transition from the paramagnetic side the fermi liquid is strongly renormalized .",
    "an analysis of the mean field pm solution into the af phase reveals an orbitally selective mott decoupling and localization of the @xmath0-electrons . within the resolution of our method ,",
    "the antiferromagnetic transition and the decoupling of the @xmath0 and @xmath8 electrons take place for the same value of the hybridization . through a comparison with a wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) calculation",
    ", we further relate the nature of the transition to the proximity of the system in the parameter space to the quantum critical point of the two - impurity kondo model ( 2ikm)@xcite .",

    "the three - dimensional periodic anderson model hamiltonian is @xmath10 where @xmath11 creates a conduction band electron at site @xmath12 with spin @xmath13 and @xmath14 does the same for the localized orbitals .",
    "the conduction electron bandwidth @xmath15 sets the energy unit .    in the large @xmath16 limit the model maps onto the kondo lattice model , where each @xmath0 orbital is replaced by a spin @xmath17",
    "which is kondo - coupled to the local conduction electrons with a coupling @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the conduction electron density of states at the chemical potential .",
    "it is also possible to define two energy scales in the problem .",
    "the first is the single - impurity kondo temperature @xmath20 .",
    "it is not known a priori how the `` lattice '' kondo energy is related to @xmath21 .",
    "the second scale is set by the magnetic interactions .",
    "these are not contained explicitly in this hamiltonian , but an effective rkky coupling is generated in fourth order perturbation theory in @xmath22 ( second order in the kondo coupling , @xmath23 ) .",
    "the rkky coupling oscillates in real space with a period that is related to the bare conduction band fermi momentum , ranging from antiferromagnetic at half filling to ferromagnetic in the limit of an empty band .",
    "a comparison of these two energy scales allows to understand the qualitative features of the phase diagram of the model@xcite .",
    "the ratio between kondo temperature and rkky interaction is an increasing function of @xmath22 , hence for small @xmath22 we will find a phase in which the magnetic fluctuations dominate giving rise to an ordered state , while for large @xmath22 the kondo effect dominates and the @xmath0 moments are screened by the conduction electrons .    at half filling the kondo screening of the moments by the conduction electrons results in an insulator with a gap induced by the hybridization .",
    "in this paper we are interested in metallic heavy fermions , and we restrict ourselves to study the system away from half filling .    in the path integral",
    "formalism the conduction band can be integrated out in the action and replaced by an effective long - range retarded hopping for @xmath0 electrons .",
    "after these manipulations the lagrangian of the system is @xmath24 where the effect of the conduction band is absorbed in the weiss field @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    in cdmft",
    "the original three - dimensional lattice is now tiled with a superlattice of clusters and an effective anderson impurity action is derived for a single cluster .",
    "finally a self - consistency condition relates the cluster green s function to the local green s function of the superlattice .",
    "the self - consistency is more easily written as a matrix form @xmath27 @xmath28^{-1}\\ ] ] where spin index has been suppressed to simplify the notation .",
    "it is very important to notice that in the large @xmath16 limit the impurity action becomes equivalent to the action of a two impurity kondo model away from particle - hole ( p - h ) symmetry . at p - h symmetry",
    "this model is known to have a qcp separating a kondo screened phase from a phase in which the impurities are decoupled from the conduction band@xcite . away from p - h symmetry",
    "the qcp is not accessible but still influences the physics in an intermediate energy range@xcite .    in order to solve the cluster - impurity problem we employ ed . in this method",
    "the cluster action is recast in the form of an anderson impurity hamiltonian where the continuous degrees of freedom of the free electron bath are parametrized by a finite number @xmath29 of sites : @xmath30    in this representation the hybridization - function @xmath31 , related to the non interacting impurity green s function @xmath32 of the cluster impurity problem , becomes @xmath33 where the indices @xmath34 represent the cluster sites . in the figures presented in this work we used 8 sites in the bath , but the results have been tested in few points using 10 sites .",
    "the ground state and green s functions of this hamiltonian are determined via the lanczos procedure and the self - consistency equation in turns allows to derive a new set of bath parameters .",
    "the self - consistency condition is used to determine the @xmath35 function on a finite mesh of points @xmath36 .",
    "this implies a finite resolution in frequency .",
    "we used @xmath37 .",
    "the process is iterated until convergence is reached . to study the interplay of antiferromagnetism and kondo screening we restrict the study to the metallic regime close to half - filling where the rkky interaction is predominantly antiferromagnetic .",
    "this is achieved by fixing the values @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 throughout the paper .",
    "being a mean field theory , dmft gives the possibility to selectively allow some instabilities and forbid others .",
    "thus we will allow the development of af order and study the realistic material phase diagram .",
    "however we will also force the system to remain in a pm state to study the `` normal state '' underlying the af phase .",
    "this will prove important to study the kb point and to understand the origin of the transitions in the system .",
    "we compute the staggered magnetization @xmath41 as a function of @xmath22 ( fig.[magn ] ) .     and average of the quasiparticle residue @xmath42 eigenvalues for the af ( both for majority and minority spin ) and pm solutions as a function of @xmath22 .",

    "[ magn],width=302 ]    for small @xmath22 the rkky interaction is dominating and the solution describes an af state with a magnetization close to one . in the opposite limit of large @xmath22 , where the kondo screening is more effective , the system is a pm metal .",
    "increasing @xmath22 in the af phase , the magnetization decreases smoothly and approaches zero at a value @xmath43 where a phase transition occurs . above this critical value",
    "the system becomes paramagnetic .",
    "the value of @xmath44 at the transition jumps from @xmath45 for @xmath46 to @xmath47 for @xmath48 and in between the convergence becomes extremely slow .",
    "the numerical accuracy does not allow us to exclude a weakly first order transition scenario , although in this case the coexistence region would be very small .    to clarify the nature of the transition we investigate the cluster quasiparticle residue @xmath49 ( in this case , a matrix in spin and cluster indices ) .",
    "the af three - dimensional sdw theory predicts that antiferromagnetism develops from a well defined fermi liquid state and hence a finite quasiparticle residue @xmath42 at the transition . on the contrary kb scenarios",
    "predict that @xmath42 goes to zero at the transition . in fig .",
    "[ magn ] we plot the @xmath50 eigenvalues . in the af",
    "phase the two curves correspond to minority and majority species . in the pm phase we plot only the average of the eigenvalues since the difference is not appreciable on the scale of the plot . in both phases",
    "the eigenvalues of the @xmath50 matrix decrease as we approach the transition . precisely at the transition one eigenvalue goes to zero , suggesting that the kb is indeed the correct scenario in this model .    approaching the transition from the pm phase by reducing @xmath22 , we observe a strong reduction of the @xmath50 eigenvalues leading to a large effective mass enhancement .",
    "this result suggests that increasing the correlations by decreasing @xmath22 from the pm side , the fermi liquid becomes heavier and heavier , and eventually it is more favorable to get rid of the entropy by developing af long range order .",
    "the fundamental difference with the sdw picture is that here the mechanism responsible for the instability is short - ranged in space .",
    "the cluster self - energies are in fact approximately local on the pm side of the transition .",
    "this may lead to think that the results are essentially similar to a single site dmft solution of the periodic anderson model .",
    "however there are essential differences . indeed , even setting the off - diagonal self - energy @xmath51",
    "the cdmft self - consistency equations do not reduce to the corresponding single - site dmft equations . to demonstrate this we compare in the inset of fig.[magn ] the ratio between the lattice kondo temperature obtained through the relation @xmath52 and the corresponding single - impurity energy @xmath21 in the two cases .",
    "while the dmft result gives a smooth and finite @xmath53 across @xmath54 , in cdmft @xmath53 appears to approach a zero value at the transition .",
    "we take advantage now of the possibility of suppressing the af long range order to study the normal pm solution in the af phase . for @xmath55",
    "this solution is obviously unstable to antiferromagnetism and it corresponds physically to a highly frustrated system .",

    "the two hubbard bands are outside the energy range .",
    "[ spectral_function],width=302 ]    the analysis of the spectral function along the two solutions ( allowing and forbidding magnetic ordering , fig.[spectral_function ] ) reveals that the transition takes place also in absence of antiferromagnetism .",
    "namely , at small v , a phase with no spectral weight at the fermi level is realized in both cases .",
    "the kondo peak present in the pm phase disappears in going across the transition , leaving behind a pseudogap , and the @xmath0 electrons effectively decouple from the conduction band , at least within the energy resolution of our calculations .",
    "the transition is an orbitally selective mott transition for the @xmath0 band .",
    "this implies that the @xmath0 electrons do not contribute to the fermi surface for @xmath55 .",
    "this is in marked contrast with the paramagnetic single site dmft solution where there is only a fermi liquid kondo screened phase and no sign of such a transition or of a pseudogapped phase .",
    "notice also that in the cdmft treatment the @xmath0 transfer of spectral weight takes place from the fermi level to its immediate vicinity as the hybridization is reduced .",
    "this should be contrasted with the single site dmft description of the mott transition in the hubbard model where the spectral weight is transferred from the fermi level directly to the hubbard bands at much higher energies .",
    ", width=302 ]    to clarify the mott character of the transition we plot in fig.[sigma_even_odd ] the imaginary frequency behavior of the two @xmath56-eigenvalues within the pm solution , named respectively @xmath57 and @xmath58 . approaching the transition from the pm",
    "phase the slope at zero frequency of both eigenvalues increases , signaling the growth of the effective mass in the fermi liquid . at the transition the even eigenvalue develops a divergence signaling the end of the fermi liquid description and the beginning of the mott insulating phase .",
    "the odd eigenvalue has a similar divergence at a lower value of the hybridization as shown in the inset .",
    "a qualitative understanding of this behavior can be proposed considering that @xmath59 and @xmath60 represent in a loose sense the lattice self - energy calculated around momenta @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "hence the mott transition corresponds to the first appearance of a surface poles in the self - energy around the origin of the brillouin zone .",
    "decreasing further the hybridization the surface of poles moves towards the corner of the zone and finally disappears for @xmath63 .",
    "while for @xmath64 the self - energy was approximately local , in the pm solution the development of magnetism for @xmath65 is replaced by a dramatic increase of non - local correlations as shown in fig.[sigma12 ] , where we plot the real part of @xmath66 at the lowest available frequency in the imaginary axis .",

    "the vertical dashed line marks the transition . for comparison with the pm case the nrg results ( without self - consistency ) .",
    "[ sigma12],width=302 ]    the behavior of @xmath53 , of the spectral function and of the off - diagonal self - energy near the transition is very similar to the corresponding behavior found in the 2ikm close to its qcp@xcite . to establish this connection we used wilson s numerical renormalization group to solve the impurity model underlying the self - consistency in the pm case for the same set of parameters .",
    "the difference with the ed calculation is that we used a constant density of states for the nrg bath , so the results are non self - consistent",
    ". the results are nevertheless qualitatively similar .",
    "the main difference between the results of the two calculations is that the transition found in cdmft is replaced in nrg by a crossover .",
    "we ascribe this effect to the lack of a self - consistent bath in the nrg calculation . in fig.[sigma12 ] we compare the non local correlations , finding a very good agreement .",
    "other features like the pseudogap formation around @xmath54 are also reproduced .",
    "the similarity of these two results suggests that most of the physics relevant to the lattice is already captured at the level of the two impurity problem . in this case",
    "the onset of magnetism in the lattice model can be understood as arising from the vicinity to the impurity qcp .",
    "indeed at the 2ikm critical point there are three relevant operators that correspond to possible symmetry breaking instabilities .",
    "susceptibilities in the antiferromagnetic , superconducting and p - h symmetry breaking channels are diverging at the impurity qcp . since p - h symmetry",
    "is already broken in the lattice system , only the other two instabilities are left to provide a way to quench the residual entropy associated to the qcp . in this work",
    "we did not consider the superconducting instability but we expect it to play a relevant role ( and possibly compete with antiferromagnetism ) depending on the specific details of the band structure of the realistic material .",
    "notice however several important differences with the picture of local quantum criticality of ref.@xcite .",
    "the reference system describing the physics of the lattice model requires a cluster of two sites , rather than one , embedded in a medium .",
    "the critical point of this two impurity model , has two relevant directions corresponding to varying the hybridization and breaking p - h symmetry .",
    "so the impurity model without the self - consistency condition has a multicritical point rather than a critical point .",
    "generic problems , as the one considered in this paper , are p - h asymmetric , and therefore in these cases the two impurity qcp is not reachable .",
    "however the analysis of the nrg low - energy spectrum confirms that in going from one side to the other of the crossover ( correspondingly , from one side to the other of the transition in the cdmft case ) the system evolves from a state in which the impurities are screened by the conduction electrons ( for large @xmath22 ) to a state in which the impurities take advantage of the rkky interaction to form a singlet and decouple from the conduction band ( for small @xmath22 ) .",
    "hence the low - energy picture for @xmath55 is that of a conduction band asymptotically decoupled from a collection of spins arranged in singlets . in the lattice model",
    "the self - consistency condition transforms the crossover of the impurity model into a true phase transition .    following the paramagnetic solution we can also observe a violation of the luttinger theorem for @xmath55 in the form of a mismatch between the number of particles and the volume of the fermi surface .",
    "this is clear from the plot of the number of @xmath8 and @xmath0 electrons per site as a function of @xmath22 ( fig .",
    "[ densities ] ) . in the pm phase both the conduction and the @xmath0 bands are doped ( @xmath67 ) . in this case",
    "the fermi surface has a volume equal to the doping @xmath68 .",
    "the total occupation is not constant because we fixed the chemical potential rather than the density .",
    "for @xmath55 the occupation in both bands becomes essentially constant , implying that @xmath22 is no more effective . in this regime the only contribution to the fermi surface comes from the @xmath8 electrons which , being non - interacting and decoupled from the @xmath0 band , have a fermi surface with volume @xmath69 .",
    "these results once again support the orbitally selective mott transition picture of the kb @xcite .",
    "namely , an @xmath0-like fluid that becomes incompressible beyond the kb point .     and",

    "we reconstruct the rotational and translational lattice symmetry , broken by the cluster - tiling procedure , by periodization of the cumulants @xcite .",
    "this scheme is more appropriate when correlations are stronger . indeed",

    "these results are representative for the whole af phase down to small value of @xmath22 .",
    "the striking difference with respect to the pm phase is the big rearrangement of the spectral weight : now the occupied region is centered around the @xmath77 point .",
    "this result implies a sudden jump across the antiferromagnetic transition in all the properties connected with the topology of the fermi surface and it is consistent with the experimental observation of a discontinuous behavior of the hall coefficient@xcite and of the de haas - van alphen frequencies@xcite .",

    "<S> non local correlations become important and result in significant changes in the photoemission spectra and the de haas - van alphen frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the transition involves considerable @xmath0 spectral weight transfer from the fermi level to its immediate vicinity , rather than to the hubbard bands as in single site dmft . </S>"
