    "regeneration of neutral kaons is an excellent tool to study kaon - nuclear scattering @xcite and of crucial importance to experiments measuring cp violation in the kaon system @xcite . in the latter context",
    ", cplear @xcite has determined the kaon regeneration amplitude on @xmath1 in the energy range between 0.56 and 0.9  gev . in the present paper",
    "we explore the consequence of these data for strong - interaction physics analyzing the kaon - carbon scattering amplitude in the classical framework of forward dispersion relations ( fdr ) using in addition all the available information on @xmath2 scattering : of @xmath0 content , to which the analysis applies . ] the kaon regeneration on carbon @xcite , total cross sections @xcite , near forward differential cross sections @xcite , and the scattering length from kaonic atoms @xcite . for high energies , we use the regge model which is well supported experimentally @xcite . for the low energy application presented here",
    "this last aspect is not important .",
    "the energy range of the cplear experiment is however well suited to obtain information on the strong - interaction physics occurring below the elastic threshold , often termed the unphysical region .",
    "our results indicate that previous evaluations of fdrs have to be revised entirely in this region . due to the new data situation",
    ", the net contribution from the unphysical region turns out to be much smaller and a simple coherent sum of elementary @xmath3 amplitudes is inadequate and even has the wrong sign as will be discussed below .",
    "we define the regeneration amplitude as the difference between the nuclear amplitudes of forward scattering of @xmath4  and @xmath5  on @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total laboratory energy of the kaon .",
    "note that this definition , which we choose for compatibility with earlier evaluations of fdr ( an alternative definition with an extra factor @xmath9 in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "[ eqfm ] is also used in the literature ) , has the opposite sign when compared to the @xmath10 of our earlier regeneration analysis @xcite .",
    "table  1 summarizes all experimental efforts to determine the regeneration amplitude in carbon .",
    "most regeneration experiments determined modulus and phase of @xmath11 from @xmath12@xmath13  decay rates behind a regenerator @xcite .",
    "two groups @xcite also obtained a phase measurement from the time - dependent charge - asymmetry in semileptonic decays , thus independent of the cp violation phase @xmath14 .",
    "owing to the isospin symmetry of the @xmath15  nucleus , @xmath16  data may be used to extract information on the regeneration amplitude , if charge invariance is assumed : @xmath17 then , with the use of the optical theorem , the difference between the total cross sections of @xmath18  and @xmath19is a measure of the imaginary part of @xmath11 @xcite ( table  2 ) .",
    "one of these experiments @xcite also derived values for the real part from a measurement of the differential cross section @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath18@xmath6  scattering length , @xmath21 , extracted @xcite from x - ray transition data obtained with kaonic carbon @xcite may be regarded as a measurement of the @xmath4  scattering amplitude near zero kinetic energy",
    ". the corresponding amplitude for @xmath5 , having no inelastic channels open below threshold , must be purely real such that @xmath22 .",
    "where appropriate , the results have been adapted to the current world averages for the neutral kaon parameters , such as @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "it is important to note that some of these averages , in particular @xmath14 , are themselves influenced by regeneration measurements so that care must be taken when employing them to correct these very measurements .",
    "such feedback effects , however , were found to be very small and may be neglected in our analysis .",
    "the corrected data are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ figmodule] [ figre ] , separately for measurements of modulus , phase , imaginary and real part of @xmath11 . figure  [ figim ] reveals a conspicuous systematic disagreement between the total cross section results of ref .",
    "@xcite and the data of the other three experiments at the same energies .",
    "we exclude the data published in ref .",
    "@xcite from our fit , imaginary parts as well as real parts , as the latter directly depend on the former . for",
    "their impact see section  [ fitres ] .",
    "in the framework of local relativistic field theories , analyticity of the amplitude has been proven to follow from local causality and it is therefore very natural to assume it as well for kaon scattering off nuclei .",
    "we use an unsubtracted dispersion relation as it is readily derived for antisymmetric amplitudes @xcite .",
    "since the precision of the data does not allow fitting several pole terms , they are represented by a single effective pole : @xmath26 where @xmath8 denotes the total laboratory energy of the kaon and @xmath27 stands for principal value .",
    "the effective pole term contains two parameters , position @xmath28 and residue @xmath29 .",
    "the lowest inelastic threshold @xmath30 mev corresponds to @xmath31 system at zero energy , see fig .",
    "[ figdiag]a .",
    "the integration over the imaginary part starts at @xmath32 and extends all the way to infinity ( the physical region of @xmath5  and @xmath4scattering on @xmath6  corresponds to @xmath33 ) . to carry out the integration , a parameterization of @xmath34",
    "is needed over this range .",
    "guided by the data and theoretical expectations , we have chosen the following parameterization :    * the regge model with one pole trajectory exchange @xcite is applied at energies above a certain energy @xmath35 , giving @xmath36 ) .",

    "we parameterize it for simplicity as a gaussian on a background , the shape of which we describe by the same simple power law as employed at high energies , but with a different exponent : @xmath40 )        + c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2 }         \\left[\\frac{\\omega-\\omega_\\mathrm{res}}{\\sigma }                                              \\right]^2\\right )      \\label{imfbgpeak}\\ ] ] the transition energy @xmath35 follows from @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 if the function @xmath45 is to be continuous . in the fit",
    ", we will vary @xmath35 in place of @xmath44 as a free parameter . *",
    "the sensitivity of the cplear data to the imaginary part of the regeneration amplitude is not sufficient for a parameter fit in the energy range below the first total cross section measurements in the 850 mev region . following refs . @xcite and @xcite , we simply assume an essentially linear increase of @xmath34 from the physical threshold to 830 mev total laboratory energy , in accordance with the data . * at the physical threshold , we fix @xmath34 to the value corresponding to the measured @xmath18@xmath6  scattering length .",
    "the small error on this measurement is negligible in this analysis . *",
    "virtually nothing is known about @xmath46 below the elastic threshold , except that it must vanish at @xmath32 , the beginning of the cut .",
    "we find that any smooth and small contribution from the integral between @xmath32 and @xmath47 in ( [ dr ] ) is compatible with the experimental information , so that we may assume a linear behavior for this energy range as well .",
    "this gives a total of nine parameters to be determined in the fit .",
    "all of these parameters result from the interpolation of the data except for the effective pole , which represents the unphysical region below the elastic threshold .",
    "it turns out , however , that our evaluations are quite insensitive to the pole position @xmath28",
    ". we therefore fix it to the position of the @xmath48  pole , given by the total energy needed to form a @xmath15@xmath49 resonance , @xmath50 which gives @xmath51 172.3 mev .",
    "further parameters are needed for experimental reasons . as is evident from fig .",
    "[ figmodule ] , there are systematic shifts in the normalization of the moduli measured by the high energy experiments ( parameter @xmath42 ) whereas there is good agreement on the slope parameter @xmath41 . to prevent the systematic normalization uncertainties from affecting the result on @xmath41 , we allow for three additional correction factors , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the brookhaven @xcite , serpukhov @xcite and fermilab @xcite experiments , respectively , to be determined together with the other parameters in the fit .",
    "since the later fermilab publication  @xcite does not contain individual data points but only the value of @xmath41 resulting from their analysis , we directly employ this value in our fit .",
    "we now vary the 11 parameters defined in the preceding section and compare at each data point the prediction for the real part from ( [ dr ] ) with the experiment .",
    "correlations between different measured quantities are taken into account where they have been reported , in particular the strong correlations between our own measurements of imaginary and real parts @xcite .",
    "uncertainties in the kaon beam energy are neglected throughout .",
    "the weighted deviations are then summed up to a @xmath55 in the usual way .",
    "minimization of this @xmath55 therefore reflects both the measured imaginary and real parts of the amplitude and yields the following parameters ( @xmath56 for 127 degrees of freedom ) : @xmath57    n_\\mathrm{car }       & = & 0.96    \\pm   0.02                    \\\\    n_\\mathrm{alb }       & = & 1.22    \\pm   0.07                    \\\\    n_\\mathrm{roe }       & = & 1.07    \\pm   0.03                    \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the resulting fit functions are shown in figs .",
    "[ figmodule][figre ] , together with an optical model calculation @xcite .",
    "the results in the near - threshold region are only weakly sensitive to the uncertainty in the high energy region . in particular , the total contribution of the regge asymptotics ( [ eqregge ] ) from @xmath58 to the value @xmath59 is about 0.9 fm , with the estimated error being less than 0.1  fm .    in order to discuss the physics below the elastic threshold we introduce the discrepancy function @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 represents the dispersion integral ( eq .",
    "[ dr ] ) from the physical region in @xmath62 we use a linear parameterization of @xmath45 for @xmath63 as described in section  [ drp ] .",
    "its contribution to @xmath64 is negligible in the energy range of cplear data . ] ( @xmath65 ) . if the unphysical region is well represented in the physical region by the effective pole assumed in eq .",
    "[ dr ] then the quantity @xmath66 should be independent of the energy and equal to the effective residue , @xmath67 in fig .",
    "[ figdelta ] we show @xmath68 for @xmath28 from eq .  [ pole ] corresponding to a @xmath15@xmath49 system .",
    "the function @xmath68 is not sensitive to the exact pole position and fig .",
    "[ figdelta ] shows no energy dependence which confirms the validity of the effective pole ansatz .",
    "the effective residue turns out to be small and negative while previous attempts to determine it from fdr led to large and positive values : @xmath69 the main reason for this is that both of these earlier analyses completely relied on the data of ref .",
    "@xcite which we have discarded in view of their incompatibility with all other experiments .",
    "given the large error bars of these data , their inclusion into our fit hardly changes the pole residue but increases the @xmath55 to 197.6 for now 133 degrees of freedom . without the cplear data for the real part , we would get a large positive residue of order of @xmath70 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ figdelta ] , consistent with the earlier analysis @xcite .",
    "our main result therefore is that the residue is small . in our analysis",
    "even its negativity is stable against considerable variations of a smooth background in the unphysical region and against variations of the imaginary part in the physical region below 830  mev .",
    "however , since the contribution of the effective pole is not large where the real parts are measured by cplear , @xmath71 gev , the sign is less certain than the magnitude .    from first principles the sign of the residue",
    "is directly related to the parity of the system of the particles exchanged @xcite . for the elementary @xmath16@xmath72  scattering ,",
    "hyperon exchange leads to a positive residue ( similar to @xmath73@xmath74  scattering ) . hence if the unphysical region for @xmath75@xmath15  scattering were dominated by the superposition of elementary hyperon exchange of fig .",
    "[ figdiag]a , a positive residue would be expected .",
    "if , however , an additional pion in a relative s - wave is exchanged ( fig .",
    "[ figdiag]b ) or if the hyperon in fig .",
    "[ figdiag]a is in p - wave relative to the spectator nucleons , then the opposite parity results and the residue is negative .",
    "our analysis clearly indicates that there are large cancellations between these contributions with different parities since the residue is stably small .",
    "the smallness of the effective residue is actually very gratifying since the earlier results @xcite claiming a large and positive residue are very hard to understand .",
    "as was already noticed by dumbrajs @xcite , the impulse approximation has no chance to work .",
    "he observed that the measured imaginary part ( total cross section ) at low energies are much smaller than the impulse approximation while the result for the effective residue ( [ effresvalue]c ) is about 50% larger than the sum of the elementary residues for @xmath76 and @xmath77 exchanges .",
    "the value ( [ effresvalue]b ) from @xcite is even bigger .",
    "our result ( [ effresvalue]a ) therefore solves a long standing puzzle .",
    "the threshold region deserves some comment . in view of the large and repulsive @xmath18@xmath6  scattering length @xcite",
    "we have also used the near threshold parameterization of @xcite where this feature is related to a narrow peak in the imaginary part below threshold , see fig .",
    "3 . this local structure near threshold does not affect our parameters for the effective pole , as we have checked .",
    "our evaluation gives for the real part of the regeneration amplitude at threshold @xmath78fm .",
    "using the real part of the @xmath79 scattering length @xmath80fm from ref.@xcite we obtain the real part of the @xmath81 scattering length @xmath82fm .",
    "the value of @xmath83 should be considered as an estimate : it is sensitive to the parameterization of @xmath45 near the elastic threshold because of a steep energy dependence of @xmath84 ( see fig.[figre ] ) . for comparison , using an optical model , we obtain @xmath85fm .",
    "obviously there is a partial cancellation between the contributions from @xmath18  and @xmath19  for @xmath11 since both scattering lengths are repulsive .",
    "while these findings are interesting for the discussion of scattering lengths and the detailed behavior of the amplitudes near threshold , these local structures are irrelevant for our discussion of the effective pole which is dominated by much larger energy scales ( the energy range of the cplear experiment ) .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that the combined information on the @xmath86 and @xmath87 amplitudes is very well described by a forward dispersion relation containing only a small effective pole contribution from the subthreshold region , consistent with theoretical expectations .",
    "earlier evaluations claiming a large contribution from the unphysical region can be excluded on the basis of the measured regeneration amplitude from cplear in combination with the information on this reaction from all other consistent experimental data .",
    "these results are of relevance in the analysis of nuclear scattering and of cp - violation experiments at low energy @xcite .",
