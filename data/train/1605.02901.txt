    "this allows the use of a weak probe beam while keeping the signal high compared to detection noise .",
    "we estimate that for our scheme the number of scattered photons per atom can be small enough ( @xmath0 150 photons ) such that single site detection could be realized without additional cooling .",

    "in conclusion , we propose a holographic scheme for site - resolved detection of a 2d gas of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "we have discussed the method for the example of 50 lithium atoms in a square optical lattice , but it will also work for larger sample sizes , other atomic elements , or other lattice geometries .",
    "the method features a high detection fidelity ( @xmath167 ) even for a low number of scattered photons per atom ( @xmath168 ) in the presence of detection noise .",
    "jhd would like to thank jrgen eschner for an interesting discussion on photon scattering .",
    "the authors thank all the members of the institut fr quantenmaterie .",
    "this work was supported by the german research foundation dfg within the sfb / trr21 ."

    "<S> fourier transformation of the recorded intensity pattern reconstructs the atomic distribution in the lattice with single - site resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the holographic detection method requires only a few hundred scattered photons per atom in order to achieve a high reconstruction fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , additional cooling during detection might not be necessary even for light atomic elements such as lithium . </S>"
