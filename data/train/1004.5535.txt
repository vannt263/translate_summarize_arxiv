    "accurately determining the thermodynamic state of the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) out to large radii in galaxy clusters is critical for understanding the link between the total cluster mass and x - ray observables . for over a decade , observations of the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( tsze , hereafter simply sz ; sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 ) have been considered as a promising complement to x - ray observations for modeling the icm in galaxy clusters , yet only recently has it been possible to make meaningful de - projections of gas temperature and density profiles using sze imaging data from multi - pixel bolometer arrays . the apex - sz experiment ( dobbs et al .",
