    "a wide variety of electrostatic and electromagnetic oscillatory modes are known to propagate in unmagnetized and magnetized plasmas @xcite . since more than a decade ago , it has been pointed out , and is now well established , that the presence of heavy charged dust particulates in a plasma may strongly modify the dispersion properties of the known low - frequency modes , and may also introduce novel waves @xcite .",
    "for instance , inclusion of the dust particle dynamics in an unmagnetized dusty plasma gives rise to the dust - acoustic waves @xcite , while the modification of the plasma constituents charge balance is responsible for the dust ion - acoustic waves @xcite , characterized by an increased phase speed in comparison with the acoustic speed in an electron - ion plasma without dust . in a magnetized dusty plasma , a variety of new modes",
