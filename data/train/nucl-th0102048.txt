    "in recent years , a series of accurate calculations of @xmath0 scattering observables below the deuteron breakup threshold ( dbt ) by using the kohn variational principle ( kvp ) have been reported  @xcite .",
    "the resulting elastic @xmath1 phase shifts were found to be in strict agreement with those determined via accurate solutions of the faddeev equations ( fe )  @xcite .",
    "the interest in this reaction has been revived consequently on the observation of large disagreements between theoretical predictions and experimental data for the @xmath2 and @xmath1 @xmath3 and @xmath4 polarization observables  @xcite .",
    "since the solution of the @xmath0 schroedinger equation can be obtained with high precision , the disagreements can be traced back to the current models for the nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( nn ) and three  nucleon ( 3n ) interactions .",
    "therefore , the detailed studies of this process can be used to get information on the microscopic nuclear interaction .",
    "above the dbt , the fe have been accurately solved for the @xmath1 reaction ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . for reactions where there are more than one charged particles in the final state ,",
    "the proper inclusion of the coulomb interaction is a difficult problem . on the other hand ,",
    "the proton induced breakup reaction is more easily studied experimentally , and in fact , there is a large amount of high precision @xmath2 scattering data available .",
    "it should be noticed that the effect of the coulomb potential can be rather sizeable for various polarization observables , in particular at small scattering angles .",
    "it is therefore of relevance to obtain accurate theoretical estimates of the observables of this reaction .    at present , different approaches are applied to calculating the @xmath2 elastic observables above the dbt .",
    "the method used in refs .",
    "@xcite consists of separating the long  range from the short  range coulomb effects .",
    "then , the fe in momentum space are solved by taking into account only the short  range part of the coulomb potential , whilst the long  range contribution is included by `` renormalizing '' the solutions found .",
    "this method has been pursued for applications in both atomic systems and @xmath2 scattering at @xmath5 mev  @xcite .",
    "in other approaches , the fe are solved using the coulomb - sturmian - space representation  @xcite , or by directly solving the fe in configuration space  @xcite .",
    "the kvp was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite to treat breakup reactions without considering the case of two or more charged particles in the final state . in the past it has been used mainly for studying atomic processes ( in particular , the scattering of electrons or positrons by hydrogen atoms ) . above the ionization threshold",
    "the direct application of the kvp has however encountered various problems related to the infinite number of two  body bound states between particles of opposite charge and to the complexity of the boundary conditions to be satisfied  @xcite .",
    "various alternative formulations have then been studied and the associated difficulties analyzed  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we reconsider the direct formulation of the kvp for calculating the _ elastic _",
    "part of the s  matrix of a @xmath2 collision above the dbt .",
    "in such a process there is no problem relating to two  body excited bound states .",
    "the long  range coulomb interaction between the two protons introduces a distortion in the description of the asymptotic three - nucleon outgoing wave .",
    "we have proved the validity of such a principle , considering trial wave functions which satisfy `` simplified '' boundary conditions allowing for practical applications , even when using realistic nuclear interactions .",

    "different asymptotic regions has been introduced for different values of the hyperspherical variables ( @xmath362 ) and the solution of the faddeev - noble equations has been studied in each case .",
    "it was found that certain asymptotic configurations in the @xmath363 system have negligible probability .",
    "for example , the breakup w.f .",
    "vanishes in region @xmath364 when particles @xmath365 are protons or when they are in a relative state with angular momentum @xmath366 , independently of the fact that they form a @xmath367 or an @xmath368 pair .",
    "the transition from the solution in region @xmath369 to these vanishing solutions has been studied .",
    "moreover , it was explicitly shown that the use of `` approximate '' terms in the asymptotic logarithmic distortion of the breakup wave function does not influence the formal derivation and the practical application of the principle .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath370 is in any region a smooth function ( as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : summ ] ) .",
    "thus it is not very critical to try to reproduce it with some approximate method like an expansion over hh functions .",
    "the hyperspherical basis has been found to be a rather natural one to describe the asymptotic behavior of the wave function describing scattering above the dbt , including also the long  range coulomb interaction .",
    "in fact , the equations to be solved have a very simple structure in terms of @xmath113 in the asymptotic region and , accordingly , analytical solutions can be obtained . in practical applications",

    "appropriate values of the matching radius @xmath372 have been found to be in the range of @xmath373 fm .",
    "the convergence of the quantities of interest is the usual problem which one has to face when applying a variational procedure . in two preceding papers  @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the convergence of the elastic observables can be achieved with the same precision as below dbt .",
    "realistic nn and 3n interactions can be used to calculate the observables in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 case , so meaningful comparisons with experimental data can be performed . in the present work a detailed discussion of the problem related to possible inaccuracies introduced from an approximate description of the outgoing breakup waves",
    "was presented , including a numerical example .    in conclusion ,",
    "the kvp provide a formalism from which it is possible to obtain reliable and fully  converged results for the elastic part of the @xmath2 s  matrix at energies above the dbt even with the inclusion of the long range coulomb interaction .",
