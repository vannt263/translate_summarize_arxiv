    "in 2003 brown et al . ( 2004 ) discovered distant solar system object sedna whose orbit defied all dynamical models that existed at that time .",
    "sedna resides in an area of phase space that was previously thought to have been unoccupied .",
    "effectively its orbit is dynamically isolated from the rest of the solar system . with a semi - major axis of only 533  au",
    ", its orbit is nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than that of a typical oort cloud object , but at the same time is also much larger than that of most kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) . with a perihelion distance of 76",
    "au well beyond the orbit of neptune , dynamical interaction between neptune and sedna is limited to precession . with an aphelion of @xmath21000 au , sedna is too close to the sun to feel the effects of passing stars and galactic tides in the present - day solar neighbourhood that act on classical oort cloud objects .",
    "the only viable mechanism to place sedna on its current orbit is through a gravitational force that was active at some time earlier in the history of the solar system .",
    "several formation scenarios have been put forth to explain sedna s extreme orbit and the population of objects on similar orbits predicted to exist as a result ( for the purposes of this paper we refer to this population as the inner oort cloud ; ioc ) : an encounter of a solar mass star passing at about 500 - 1000  au from the sun at low velocity ( morbidelli & levison 2004 , keyon & bromley 2004 ) , gravitational scattering by a distant planetary - sized solar companion ( gomes et al .",
    "2006 , gladman & chan , 2006 ) , solar migration in the galaxy during an episode of intense planetesimal scattering ( kaib et al . 2011 ) , gravitational scattering produced by multiple stellar encounters while the sun was residing in an embedded cluster ( brasser et al .",
    "2006 , brasser et al . 2012 ) or an open cluster ( kaib & quinn , 2008 ) .",
    "with sedna alone it is impossible to distinguish between the formation mechanisms . in the past decade , it has been difficult to further refine the sedna formation models and the dynamical history of the outer solar system because no other objects in the ioc region with perihelia greater than 70 au , had been found .",
    "the situation has recently changed with the discovery of 2012 vp113 , a distant object with perihelion distance @xmath380  au and semi - major axis of only @xmath4270  au ( trujillo & sheppard , 2014 ) . like sedna",
    ", 2012 vp113 does not dynamically interact with neptune and the same arguments pertain to its origin as those of sedna . though the discovery of 2012 vp113 confirms the existence of the ioc , with only two confirmed members it is still not possible to uniquely identify the ioc formation mechanism .",
    "dynamically the orbits of 2012 vp113 and sedna have a clear origin distinct from the kuiper belt and scattered disc ( sd ; duncan & levison , 1997 ) as part of the ioc , but what about the formation of other distant bodies closer to sun than sedna and 2012 vp113 with perihelia detached from neptune often referred to as ` detached ' kbos ( gladman et al 2008 ) ?",
    "these objects reside on orbits with typically much lower semi - major axes ( @xmath2225 - 400  au ) and perihelia ( between 44  au and 49  au ) than sedna and 2012 vp113 ( gladman et al . 2002 ) . for this paper",
    "we define this detached population as orbits with semi - major axis @xmath5  au and @xmath6  au .",
    "the orbital elements of all known detached kbos to date are listed in table  [ iocesd ] .",
    "do these detached kbos also belong to the ioc or are they instead emplaced by neptune as part of the kuiper belt s extended scattered disc ( esd ; gladman et al .",
    "we define an esd object as a detached kbo not in resonance with neptune . at present",
    "it is unclear where the boundary lies between the esd and the ioc .    dynamical simulations by gomes et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and lykawka & mukai ( 2007 ) show that high - order mean motion resonances with neptune , coupled with the kozai mechanism ( kozai , 1962 ) in these resonances , can produce an esd .",
    "objects can become permanently trapped in the esd during neptune s outward migration when they reach low eccentricity because they pop out of the resonance , thereafter no longer interacting with neptune ( gomes , 2011 )",
    ". gomes et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and lykawka & mukai ( 2007 ) show that the combined resonance - kozai mechanism operates for objects with semi - major axis @xmath7  au , and the maximum perihelion distance is typically 60  au . therefore it is most likely that any object with @xmath8  au and @xmath9  au belongs to the esd , but objects with semi - major axis @xmath10  au and perihelion distance @xmath11  au could have a different dynamical origin and are most likely part of the ioc in which both sedna and 2012 vp113 belong .",
    "objects with @xmath12  au and @xmath13  au would also be classified as belonging to the ioc . from these criteria",
    "the origin of 2000 cr105 ( gladman et al . , 2002 ) , 2004 vn112 ( becker et al . , 2008 ) , and 2010 gb174 ( chen et al",
    ". , 2013 ) is less clear : they could be part of the ioc i.e. they were placed on their current orbits during the early stages of the solar system and evolved very little since , or they could be part of the esd and were placed there during giant planet migration when they interacted with neptune .",
    "the current studies presented above are based on the assumption there were only four giant planets ( two gas giants and two ice giants ) present in the outer solar system during planetesimal driven migration .",
    "recent modelling ( batygin et al . 2010 , nesvorn 2011 , nesvorn & morbidelli 2012 ) find that a five - planet scenario ( two gas giant planets and three ice giants ) , where one of the ice giants is subsequently ejected by jupiter , can also reproduce the present day orbits of the giant planets in the solar system . in the past several years",
    ", there has been growing evidence that the five - planet scenario may provide a better match to the architecture of the outer solar system ( batygin et al .",
    "2012 , nesvorn & morbidelli 2012 , brasser & lee 2014 ) . during the ejection process",
    ", the third ice giant may have spent on the order of a few tens of thousands of years on an eccentric orbit with a semi - major axis greater than 50  au before finally exiting the solar system .",
    "although this time is relatively short compared to the age of the solar system , it may still be sufficient for secular resonances to act on the orbits of sd objects and ioc objects . to date",
    "no study has been performed that determined the influence of the fifth planet on the sd and ioc .",
    "the discovery of 2012 vp113 has fostered a need to re - examine the distinction between the ioc and the esd and the boundary where these two populations are distinguishable in terms of the cluster birth scenario .",
    "this re - examination should occur in the framework of both four and five planet models .",
    "though the embedded cluster ioc model does not present a unique solution to sedna s origin , it does predict a unique series of orbital distributions that can be tested and constrained by observations . the majority of the other proposed scenarios have a rather low probability of occurrence , while most stars form in embedded star clusters ( lada & lada , 2003 ) . additionally , with the recent discovery of a possible solar sibling ( ramrez et al . ,",
    "2014 ) , the star cluster birth becomes more viable .",
    "in this paper we aim to quantify which objects belong to the ioc and which ones are part of the esd , issue a few criteria for observers to immediately classify an object as belonging to the ioc , identify which objects serve as a crucial test for the embedded cluster model of sedna s formation , and simultaneously focus recovery efforts on these objects .",
    "we shall focus mostly on using the established four planet models of levison et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and brasser & morbidelli ( 2013 ) and then examine the influence of the fifth planet .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in the section 2",
    "we summarize the embedded cluster birth formation model for the ioc .",

    "sedna s proximity to the sun and detached orbit led to the suggestions that it could be part of the inner oort cloud ( ioc ) ( hills , 1981 ) .",
    "this suggestion led brasser et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to study the origin of sedna while the sun was still in its embedded birth cluster .",
    "their motivation rested on the suggestion that most stars form in embedded star clusters ( lada & lada , 2003 ) .",
    "more recently ramrez et al.(2014 ) have spectroscopically identified the first candidate solar sibling strengthening the argument that the sun was likely born in a stellar cluster .",
    "brasser et al . (",
    "2006 ) performed numerical simulations of jupiter and saturn scattering planetesimals in their vicinity , which at large distances were then subjected to stellar encounters and tidal forces from the cluster .",
    "they concluded that sedna would be at the inner edge of the oort cloud if the central density of the cluster peaked at 10000 solar masses per cubic parsec ( @xmath15  pc@xmath16 ) .",
    "schwamb et al .",
    "( 2010 ) compared their palomar observations of distant solar system objects with perihelia @xmath17  au , and compared them to the models of brasser et al .",
    "they only considered objects with @xmath17  au to minimise the probability of dynamical interaction with neptune .",
    "they concluded that the cluster with central density 10000 @xmath15  pc@xmath16 was the most consistent with their data , where sedna was situated close to the inner edge of the ioc , ruling out with high confidence a model with central density 10@xmath18  @xmath15  pc@xmath16 ( where sedna was closer to the central part of the ioc ) .    even though the brasser et al .",
    "( 2006 ) models demonstrated the feasibility of producing sedna and the ioc while the sun was in its birth cluster , it contained several approximations and dynamical shortcomings . employing a much more sophisticated computer code and a more realistic model and initial conditions for the star cluster , brasser et al .",
    "( 2012 ) reassessed the formation of the inner oort cloud in an embedded star cluster .",
    "they used two types of central potential for the cluster : the hernquist potential ( hernquist , 1990 ) and the plummer potential ( plummer , 1911 ) .",
    "the former is more centrally condensed than the other .",
    "they also varied the number of stars in each cluster , ranging from 50 to 1000 , the central concentration , and embedded gas lifetime .",
    "table  [ cluster ] presents a summary of the various parameters and their values .",
    "brasser et al .",
    "( 2012 ) concluded that the production of sedna was a generic outcome and that all cluster models that were tested in that work fit the observations of schwamb et al .",
    "trujillo & sheppard ( 2014 ) combine their survey results with that of schwamb et al ( 2010 ) , testing an orbital distribution similar to that produced by the brasser et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and brasser et al .",
    "( 2012 ) cluster birth scenario .",
    "they find that the discovery of sedna and 2012 vp113 is consistent with stellar cluster produced population if sedna and 2012 vp113 are at the starting edge of the orbital distribution .",

    "at present it is unclear what is the extent of the esd , and , assuming a cluster birth scenario , where the boundary lies between the esd and the ioc . to answer this we need to know how the dynamical evolution of the ioc and the sd shaped their current populations .",
    "we use numerical simulations subjecting the ioc and sd to giant planet migration and evolve the populations over the remaining age of the solar system including the effects of passing stars and galactic tides in the current solar environment .      for direct comparison , we make use of the same four - planet migration history for both the ioc and sd simulations .",
    "we emphasise that we do not distinguish between early or late giant planet migration , but only use the fact that the giant planets did migrate .",
    "we have used the recipe for giant planet evolution described in levison et al .",
    "more precisely , we re - enact the evolution shown in their run a in which , at the end of the phase of mutual close encounters among the planets , neptune s semi - major axis is @xmath19  au and its eccentricity is @xmath20 .",
    "uranus s semi - major axis and eccentricity are @xmath21  au and @xmath22 .",
    "the mutual inclination of both planets is approximately 1@xmath14 .",
    "jupiter remains at 5  au , saturn stays at 9.5  au .",
    "uranus migrates from 17  au to nearly 19  au while neptune migrates outwards to settle close to 31  au .",
    "the evolution of the planets is shown in fig .",
    "we want to emphasize that the real evolution of the planets can not be traced , so that we do not expect that the evolution we consider is exactly right .",
    "however , the evolution of run a leads to final planetary orbits very similar to the current ones and shows a high compatibility with the currently known orbital structure of the kuiper belt ( levison et al . ,",
    "hence we argue the evolution above is representative of what could have happened in reality , though with the caveat that this case was most likely a maximum planetary eccentricity case and therefore more likely to emplace detached objects further out from neptune s current orbit .      for the ioc",
    ", we took as initial conditions the orbits of ioc objects from brasser et al .",
    "we combined the end results for all number of stars but we kept the other parameters fixed .",
    "these orbits of the ioc objects are taken at the epoch the sun left the cluster and thus they underwent no subsequent evolution .",
    "we performed sixteen simulations , eight for iocs formed during star clusters modelled using the more centrally concentrated hernquist potential ( hernquist , 1990 ) , and another eight using the less concentrated plummer models ( plummer , 1911 ) .",
    "the different runs for each potential are for various values of the central concentration and gas removal time .",
    "we lumped together the iocs for different number of stars in the cluster since the structure of the ioc appeared insensitive to the cluster size ( brasser et al . , 2012 ) .",
    "this resulted in sixteen different simulations ( 2 potentials , 2 concentrations and 2 gas lifetimes ) .    to determine where the inner edge of the ioc resides we need to subject the ioc to giant planet migration .",
    "the outward migration of neptune , together with a possible high - eccentricity phase , could eliminate any ioc objects with perihelia up to about 40  au , and possibly higher .",
    "these simulations are intended to determine the minimum semi - major axis and perihelion distance where we can safely argue the object is part of the ioc rather than the esd .",
    "the ioc was composed of massless test particles whose orbital elements were used directly after the sun escaped the star cluster .",
    "the system of planets and test particles were numerically integrated for 200  myr with swift rmvs4 ( levison & duncan , 1994 ) .",
    "we included the influence of the galactic tide and passing stars .",
    "the tides were implemented using the method of levison et al .",
    "( 2001 ) with a galactic density of 0.1  @xmath23  pc@xmath16 ( holmberg & flynn , 2000 ) and galactic rotational velocity 30.5 km  s@xmath24  kpc@xmath24 ( mcmillan & binney , 2010 ) .",
    "the perturbations from passing stars were included as described in heisler et al .",
    "( 1987 ) with the stellar spectral data and velocity of garcia - sanchez et al .",
    "the time step was 0.4  yr . objects were removed from the simulation if they were farther than 2000  au from the sun , were unbound , hit a planet or came closer than 0.5  au from the sun .",
    "we deliberately removed any test particles farther than 2000  au from the sun because we are interested in the evolution of the innermost part of the ioc , where 2012 vp113 and sedna reside , and where the galactic tides are almost inactive .",
    "we found that particles farther than 2000  au underwent substantial evolution in their perihelion distance because of the galactic tide and they could contaminate the inner core of the ioc .",
    "this cutoff is somewhat closer than the 3000  au used by brasser & morbidelli ( 2013 ) but the results are virtually independent of it .",
    "after the migration of the planets , as described in section [ sec : migration ] , we continued our simulations for another 4  gyr .",
    "we kept the planets on their final orbits just after migration .",
    "this second set of simulations were performed with scatr ( kaib et al . , 2011 ) , which is a symplectically - correctedadaptive timestepping routine .",
    "it is based on swift s rmvs3 ( levison & duncan , 1994 ) .",
    "it has a speed advantage over swift s rmvs3 or mercury ( chambers , 1999 ) for objects far away from both the sun and the planets where the time step is increased .",
    "we set the boundary between the regions with short and long time step at 300  au from the sun ( kaib et al .",
    "closer than this distance the computations are performed in the heliocentric frame , like swift s rmvs3 , with a time step of 0.4  yr . farther than 300  au , the calculations are performed in the barycentric frame and we increased the time step to 50  yr .",
    "the error in the energy and angular momentum that is incurred every time an object crosses the boundary at 300  au is significantly reduced through the use of symplectic correctors ( wisdom et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "for the parameters we consider , the cumulative error in energy and angular momentum incurred over the age of the solar system is of the same order or smaller than that of swift s rmvs3 .",
    "the same galactic and stellar parameters as in the first set of simulations were used , and the same removal conditions .      for the creation , and subsequent evolution , of the esd",
    "we did not perform any new scattered disc simulations .",
    "we use the same definition of an sd object as brasser & morbidelli ( 2013 ) : an sd object is defined to have @xmath25  au and @xmath26 30  a. we examined the resulting orbital distributions produced in the sd simulations performed by brasser & morbidelli ( 2013 ) .",
    "the brasser & morbidelli ( 2013 ) simulations surpass those of gomes et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and lykawka & mukai ( 2007 ) in that they use a controlled migration evolution of the giant planets and contain many more test particles .",
    "we briefly summarise below the process brasser & morbidelli ( 2013 ) used to generate their sd and esd populations .",
    "brasser & morbidelli ( 2013 ) use the same initial conditions and giant planet migration as described in section [ sec : migration ] .",
    "after the planets had stopped migrating the remaining test particles were integrated with swift rmvs3 for another 3.8  gyr .",
    "they took the planets and comets at the end of the planetary migration phase and removed all comets that were further than 3000  au from the sun . to correctly simulate the evolution of the sd , and that of the centaurs and jupiter - family comets , the planets needed to be on their current orbits , or match these as closely as possible . at the end of their migration simulations uranus was too close to the sun",
    "therefore after the migration was completed , brasser & morbidelli ( 2013 ) ran a second migration stage where they artificially migrated uranus outwards by 0.25  au to its current orbit over a time scale of 5  myr while neptune remained in place .",
    "the final configuration matched the current positions and secular properties of the giant planets .",
    "for the ioc simulations described in section [ sec : ioc ] , migrating uranus to its current position was not needed since uranus influence is negligible on the orbits of even the closest ioc orbits .",
    "thus this extra piece of migration was skipped .",
    "after this second stage of migration the planets and sd objects were integrated for 4  gyr .",
    "brasser & morbidelli ( 2013 ) cloned remaining objects immediately after this second stage of giant planet migration , and again after 1  gyr and after 3.5  gyr , to keep enough objects alive for a variety of statistical purposes .",
    "cloning was achieved by adding a random deviation of @xmath27 radians to the comets mean anomaly , keeping all the other elements fixed .",
    "the time step was 0.4  yr . objects were removed from the simulation if they strayed further than 3000  au from the sun , or hit the sun or a planet .",
    "after 4  gyr the sd in the simulations of brasser & moribdelli ( 2013 ) typically contained 2000 comets .",
    "their typical efficiency of implanting material in the sd after 4  gyr was 0.6% , implying that they effectively integrated 280000 test particles per simulation , or about 1 million test particles in total .",
    "we shall make use of this in the next section .",
    "in this section the results from our numerical simulations are presented .",
    "we determined the extent and orbital structure of the sd and esd with the help of fig .",
    "the dots are the time - evolution in semi - major axis - perihelion space of all objects in the sd with @xmath28  au and @xmath5  au over the last 400  myr of the simulation .",
    "the bullets depict the location of 2000 cr105 , 2004 vn112 , 2010 gb174 , sedna and 2012 vp113 .",
    "it is clear that there are three distinct regions determined by the presence or absence of objects .",
    "these regions are :    * @xmath29  au and @xmath30  au * @xmath1  au and @xmath31  au * @xmath1  au and @xmath6  au    we shall discuss each of these below .",
    "in the first region there are a multitude of distinct narrow regions where objects can reach high perihelion at constant semi - major axis .",
    "these peaks correspond to mean - motion resonances with neptune coupled with the kozai effect ( gomes et al .",
    ", 2005 ; lykawka & mukai , 2007 ) .",
    "objects get trapped in resonance with neptune as the latter migrates outwards , and once the particles eccentricity decreases significantly they are released from the resonance and get stranded at high perihelion .",
    "this mechanism only operates up until @xmath32  au , roughly corresponding to the 1:24 resonance with neptune , in agreement with gomes et al . , 2005 and lykawka & mukai , 2007 .",
    "at larger semi - major axis the resonance trapping mechanism is ineffective ( as evident by the lack of peaks at higher semi - major axis ) .",
    "the second region is the sd .",
    "it appears planet migration and dynamical interaction beyond 250  au does not produce objects with @xmath6  au .",
    "the sharp upper limit in perihelion distance of the sd at large semi - major axis not entirely expected .",
    "earlier works ( gomes , 2011 ; gomes et al . , 2005",
    "; lykawka & mukai , 2007 ) often migrated neptune to its current position on a nearly circular orbit , without it going through a high - eccentricity phase .",
    "our evolution of the giant planets has neptune evolving through an eccentric phase for several million years .",
    "an eccentric planet disturbs small bodies in its vicinity much more efficiently because of secular eccentricity forcing .",
    "unfortunately this same forcing damps the eccentricity of the planet on a short time scale .",
    "since neptune s aphelion was temporarily beyond 40  au one would expect a signature of this to be evident in the sd , but this does not appear to be so .",
    "there are several reasons this could be the case .",
    "the first is that the high eccentricity phase of neptune lasts too short to scatter enough material out beyond 250  au at high aphelion .",
    "second , the eccentricity of neptune was not high enough to detach objects beyond 40  au .",
    "thus the structure of the sd and the sharp upper perihelion limit of 40  au appear to be a generic outcome after neptune s migration at low or moderate eccentricity .",
    "a very high eccentricity phase is ruled out by the current orbital structure of the kuiper belt ( batygin et al . , 2011 ) and",
    "such high eccentricity evolution of neptune is seldom seen in giant planet migration simulations ( brasser & lee , 2014 ) .    that brings us to the third region , @xmath1  au and @xmath6  au , which , in this plot , is as good as empty .",
    "giant planet migration and interaction with neptune does not fill this region as discussed above , so any objects that are found here must be part of the ioc .",
    "this includes 2004 vn112 and 2010 gb174 .",
    "but what about 2000 cr105 ? from the plot",
    "it is clear that 2000 cr105 is near a mean - motion resonances with neptune ( the 1:21 ) and thus it is possible that this object got placed on its current orbit during the epoch of giant planet migration , but it may also have been placed there early on by a close stellar encounter if the cluster model is correct . from the simulations of brasser & morbidelli ( 2013 )",
    "its origin remains inconclusive : it could be an esd object or ioc object .",
    "one may argue that the origin of 2004 vn112 and 2010 gb174 could be equally inconclusive , and that these objects could also have an esd origin , but that the simulations of brasser & morbidelli ( 2013 ) did not have enough resolution to determine their origin . for objects with",
    "@xmath1  au the steady - state perihelion distribution for sd objects after 4  gyr of evolution is approximately gaussian with mean @xmath33  au and standard deviation @xmath34  au and thus it is predicted that only 0.04% of objects have @xmath35  au , though we observed none .",
    "the cumulative distribution is displayed in fig .",

    "we tried to determine whether 2004 vn112 and 2010 gb174 could have an esd origin i.e. is it possible for sd objects to be pulled into resonances with neptune at @xmath36  au that raise their perihelion to 48  au ?",
    "since the simulations of brasser & morbidelli ( 2013 ) did not have the resolution to determine whether the combined effect of resonance trapping and kozai mechanism could operate at even larger semi - major axes , we ran an extra set of simulations , in which we placed 36000 test particles on orbits with semi - major axis uniformly between 250  au and 500  au and perihelion uniformly between 38  au and 41  au and inclination uniformly from 0 to 10@xmath14 . with this setup",
    "we have an order of magnitude more objects with @xmath1  au and @xmath37  au than the simulations of brasser & morbidelli ( 2013 ) .",
    "we ran these objects for 4  gyr with scatr with the giant planets on their current orbits , removing objects when they were farther than 2000  au from the sun , hit a planet or came closer than 0.5  au from the sun .",
    "ultimately we found no cases of objects attaining orbits with @xmath0  au and @xmath1  au .",
    "we did , however , discover a different pathway to create esd objects with @xmath38  au that we shall now discuss .    the top panel of fig .",
    "[ newpath ] shows the time - evolution in semi - major axis - perihelion space of all objects in the esd with @xmath39  au and @xmath1  au over the entire 4  gyr of one simulation .",
    "it is clear that some objects reach @xmath35  au when @xmath40  au but there are a few @xmath41  au .",
    "all of these objects have become detached from neptune through the action of the galactic tides but some have diffused back to a lower semi - major axis .",
    "the evolution of two of these particles are shown on the bottom two panels .",
    "one ends at @xmath42  au with @xmath43  au and another at @xmath44  au with @xmath45  au .",
    "however , we found no objects with @xmath0  au .    in summary , within this planetary migration framework our simulations and those of gomes et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , lykawka & mukai ( 2007 ) and brasser & morbidelli ( 2013 ) indicate that the upper limit of @xmath46  au for sd objects with @xmath47  au is real .",
    "therefore , we conclude that it is highly unlikely that 2004 vn112 and 2010 gb174 are esd objects and that they have an ioc origin .      here",
    "we tried to determine what happens to the ioc under the influence of four planet giant planet migration and subsequent evolution of the solar system .",
    "we subjected the ioc to the same evolution of giant planet migration , we ran sixteen simulations ( the free parameters are hernquist or plummer potential , gas removal time , central concentration ) and we focused on the inner core , which is defined as objects with semi - major axis @xmath48  au ; sedna and 2012 vp113 are within this region .",
    "the outcome of one simulation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ ioc ] , which came from a hernquist potential run , and it is representative for the outcome of all the other simulations .",
    "we depict the ioc in semi - major axis - perihelion space , as was done in brasser et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2012 ) .",
    "the black bullets denote the ioc before giant planet migration ; this is reminiscent of the state just after the sun had left the cluster .",
    "in contrast the red bullets denote the ioc after migration and subsequent evolution to the current age of the solar system .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the structure of the ioc remained virtually unchanged .",
    "indeed , for most objects the orbital energy and perihelion distance has barley evolved .",
    "we repeat that our starting ioc contained no objects with @xmath49  au .",
    "we anticipated that neptune s migration and the subsequent evolution would clear away any objects with original perihelion @xmath31  au , but when we computed the final perihelion distribution this turned out not to be the case .",
    "some objects underwent distant encounters with neptune and were subsequently scattered onto centaur orbits or ejected from the solar system , but most objects with @xmath50  au underwent little evolution . from this",
    "we conclude that , in this scenario for the migration of the giant planets , the inner core of the ioc i.e. the region inside 2000  au , remained intact and objects that were placed there in the early stages of the solar system are still there today .",
    "we summarise the findings of this study in fig .",
    "[ cr105 ] below .",
    "this is a three - panel plot highlighting the region where the origin of objects is somewhat ambiguous .",
    "we selected the region with semi - major axes between 200  au and 500  au and perihelion distances between 40  au and 50  au .",
    "the top panel depicts the inclination versus semi - major axis , the middle panel perihelion versus semi - major axis , and the bottom panel plots argument of perihelion versus semi - major axis .",
    "the triangles are ioc objects , the bullets are simulated esd objects from the simulations of brasser & morbidelli ( 2013 ) , while the open circles are real observed objects .",
    "we have plotted many more ioc objects as there are esd objects .",
    "this is intentional and reflects the relative probabilities of objects ending up in this region through an esd and ioc origin . for semi - major axes",
    "shorter than 250  au there are plenty of esd objects , including a few outliers beyond 350  au . however , when @xmath1  au no esd objects have @xmath0  au .",
    "the inclination of most esd objects is low , between 20@xmath14 and 30@xmath14 .",
    "it appears that the ioc objects have a prograde excess and most ioc objects have inclinations lower than 60@xmath14 .",
    "this is expected because the inclination distribution is not made isotropic by the galactic tide and passing stars , and the inner edge of the ioc is known to be flattened ( brasser et al . , 2006 , 2012 ;",
    "kaib & quinn , 2008 ) .      from the above results it appears that objects in the third region ( @xmath1  au",
    ", @xmath6  au ) should have an ioc origin rather than an sd one .",
    "we can verify this claim by calculating the probability of placing objects in this region based on our numerical simulations .",
    "we first discuss the sd .    from the simulations of brasser & morbidelli ( 2013 ) we determined that in steady state only 7.5% of sd objects have @xmath1  au .",
    "of these 0.15% have both @xmath1  au and @xmath37  au .",
    "our additional simulations show that approximately 0.2% of all simulated objects reached orbits with @xmath51  au and @xmath52  au . thus , in summary , the overall probability of producing objects with @xmath51  au and @xmath52  au is @xmath53 . combining the two and scaling by the total number of integrated particles",
    ", we calculate that the probability of producing objects with @xmath52  au and @xmath0  au by this mechanism is lower than @xmath54 , and is the reason we saw no such objects in our simulations .    for an ioc origin",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "the probability of placing an ioc object with @xmath52  au and @xmath0  au is approximately 0.1% , using a total ioc formation probability of 1.5% ( brasser et al . , 2012 ) . when we restrict ourselves to imposing that the perihelion distance @xmath51  au the probability is lowered to @xmath55 .",
    "this is at least an order of magnitude higher than an esd origin , and thus it is likely that almost all objects with @xmath1  au and @xmath35  au are ioc objects .",
    "we now turn our attention to the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ cr105 ] where we plotted the instantaneous argument of perihelion of real and simulated esd and ioc objects versus their semi - major axis .",
    "trujillo & sheppard ( 2014 ) suggested that esd and ioc objects displayed a grouping in @xmath56 around 0@xmath14 , and they attributed this to the influence of an unseen planet residing in the ioc .",
    "trujillo & sheppard ( 2014 ) included objects with semi - major axis @xmath29  au and perihelion @xmath31  au , which , as we have shown , are clearly dominated by interaction with neptune . indeed , we advocate that there are to date only four ioc objects discovered : sedna , 2004 vn112 , 2010 gb174 and 2012 vp113 .",
    "while it is true that all four of these objects have @xmath56 fairly close to 0@xmath14 , we do not think that these objects are sufficient in number to claim that the @xmath56 clustering is real or just a coincidence .",
    "in fact , with our current model of migration , we rule out such clustering being real for objects with @xmath1  au because they just undergo precession at a rate the scales as @xmath57 .",
    "the precession period of sedna is of the order of 1  gyr ( brasser et al . , 2006 ) and thus any initial grouping that was present when the sun left the star cluster is long gone . in summary , more objects are needed to confirm or deny whether this grouping in @xmath56 near 0@xmath14 is real .",
    "in the above sections we examined the influence of giant planet migration , using a four planet model ( see [ sec:4planet ] ) , on the esd and the ioc .",
    "we determined that the sd ends abruptly at @xmath58  au when @xmath1  au and that objects with @xmath1  au and @xmath6  au most likely have an ioc origin .",
    "does the five planet model change this picture ?",
    "an indication of the possible success or failure of the five planet model comes from gladman & chan ( 2006 ) , who reported that an earth - mass rogue planet scattering off neptune with a dynamical lifetime of 160  myr was able to lift the perihelion of many sd objects into the esd and ioc region .",
    "the time scale for doing so is approximately @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the secular time scale , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are the mass , perihelion distance and eccentricity of the rogue planet . for an earth mass planet with perihelion @xmath64  au and @xmath65 we have @xmath66  myr , comparable to the dynamical lifetime of the rogue .",
    "however , for an ice giant of neptune s mass scattering off jupiter , we have @xmath67 and @xmath68  myr . the typical dynamical lifetime of the ice giant on an eccentric orbit with perihelion near jupiter is about 50  kyr , an order of magnitude shorter , suggesting that the eccentric ice giant may not account for much influence on the sd and the ioc .    to test the influence of the fifth planet on the sd and the ioc we ran additional simulations .",
    "the initial conditions for the giant planets and the sd were taken from brasser & lee ( 2014 ) .",
    "the five planets were placed in the 3:2 , 3:2 , 4:3 , 4:3 resonant chain .",
    "the planetesimal disk consisted of 2000 planetesimals with a surface density that scales with heliocentric distance as @xmath69 .",
    "the planetesimals were included to damp the random velocities of the giant planets and to induce migration .",
    "the outer edge of the disk was always set at 30  au .",
    "the inner edge was @xmath70  au from the outermost ice giant and the total disc mass was 35@xmath71 .",
    "we generated a hundred different realisations of the same initial conditions by giving a random deviation of @xmath27  au to the semi - major axis of each planetesimal .",
    "the simulations were performed with the symba integrator ( duncan et al . , 1998 ) , with a time step of 0.35  yr .",
    "particles were removed farther than 2000  au from the sun , when they hit a planet or came closer than 1  au to the sun , and the planets evolution was output every 100  yr . the simulations ran for 500  myr .",
    "an example of the evolution that produces the current solar system rather well is depicted in fig .",
    "[ 5plevo ] .",
    "we analysed the evolution of the planets to determine how long the 5th planet crossed the kuiper belt and sd .",
    "we report that this is consistently shorter than 30  kyr . with this in mind we performed a further 100 simulations but this time we used 12000 with the same initial conditions as the runs described above .",
    "we then analysed the distribution of planetesimals in those simulations where the planets were within 10% of their current orbits .",
    "we did not care about the final eccentricities or secular architecture . in the end 23",
    "runs matched this constraint , so that we effectively integrate 276000 planetesimals .",
    "we analysed the cumulative perihelion distribution of all planetesimals with @xmath1  au and combined them into fig .",
    "[ 5plcumq ] .",
    "note that as in the 4-planet case there are no objects with @xmath72  au .",
    "gladman & chan ( 2006 ) were able to produce esd objects through the secular interaction of sd objects with their rogue planet .",
    "our results differ from theirs because the cumulative time the fifth planet spends on an eccentric orbit is much shorter than the secular time scale calculated above .",
    "we report that the ioc remains virtually unchanged - just like in the four planet case .",
    "the fifth planet did not place any of the 276000 planetesimals from the sd into the esd , thus the probability of the fifth planet lifting a planetesimal into the esd is lower than @xmath53 . in comparison ,",
    "in the previous section we determined that an ioc origin yields a probability that is an order of magnitude higher ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "after the fifth planet was ejected we recorded no objects with @xmath73  au .",
    "thus we conclude that the influence of an ejected fifth giant planet on the outer solar system during the ejection stage is negligible with the final orbital distribution of the ed and ioc virtually indistinguishable from the four planet model .",
    "in addition , this model can not explain the possible clustering in the argument of perihelion either .",
    "we have examined the inner oort cloud produced by a stellar cluster birth origin after including the impact of neptune s migration and the effects of the solar system s subsequent evolution over 4 billion years .",
    "we explored models with four and five giant planets .",
    "we also explored the extent of the esd , examining the origin of objects with semi - major axes and perihelion less than sedna and 2012 vp113 .",
    "we find that for a four - planet migration model an object can be classified as belonging to the ioc if it has a semi - major axis larger than 250  au and a perihelion beyond 45  au . for objects with perihelia detached from neptune , but lower semi - major axes ,",
    "their origin is ambiguous and can not be used to constrain the formation of the ioc .",
    "the five planet models do not change the outcome .",
    "further wide - field surveys and discoveries of new potential ioc objects with semi - major axes beyond 250  au are needed to further test this origin scenario .",
    "interestingly trujillo & sheppard ( 2014 ) find an apparent correlation of argument of perihelion for the two confirmed members of the ioc and detected kbos objects closer in to neptune .",
    "the question is what mechanism could be responsible for this argument of perihelion correlation because the orbits of objects in the ioc and esd undergo precession from neptune that does not automatically produce this orbital correlation . from simple dynamical",
    "modelling trujillo & sheppard ( 2014 ) suggest the apparent correlation could be the result of perturbations from an unseen planet",
    ". however , since in the framework of the planet migration model we employed it appears there are to date only four confirmed ioc members .",
    "more discoveries with @xmath0  au and @xmath1  au are needed to confirm or reject this clustering in the argument of perihelion .",
