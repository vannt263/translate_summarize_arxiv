    "self - consistent electromagnetic electromagnetic fields in spatially non - uniform plasmas represent one of the fundamental aspects of plasma physics with several implications both in microwave and laser based experiments . since the  70es extensive theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite investigations have been devoted to ponderomotive effects , particle acceleration , wavebreaking , resonant absorption in plasmas with density gradients .",
    "the problem is relevant for magnetized plasmas , as well , when bernstein waves are excited as a consequence of mode conversion close to the hybrid plasma resonances .",
    "recently , a renewed interest for electron bernstein wave physics has apperaed due to the possibility of implementing an attractive radiation emission diagnostic in fusion plasmas @xcite .",
    "then it is interesting to investigate the kinetic aspects of the propagation of electromagnetic as well as electrostatic fields in a non uniform plasma with arbitrary density and magnetic field scales , and electric field amplitudes .",
    "a 1d2v open boundary vlasov - ampere code has been implemented with the aim of achieving a more realistic investigation of the propagation of a finite amplitude signal in an inhomogeneous plasma , and it has been applied to study the propagation of an externally driven , localized charge density fluctuation in an unmagnetized plasma with an equilibrium spatially nonuniform density @xcite .",
    "previous analyses of magnetized plasmas @xcite , carried out in a slab geometry with periodic boundary conditions , have shown that strongly anisotropic distribution functions are produced both in the electron @xcite and in the ion @xcite populations during the interaction of plasma with an externally applied propagating electrostatic wave . in those cases",
    "the background plasma inhomogeneities could be modelled by varying the ratio of the pump frequency to the electron plasma frequency @xcite .    here , the propagation of the spatially localized finite amplitude electromagnetic perturbation in a homogeneous magnetized collisionless plasma is preliminarly investigated , the final aim being the study of electromagnetic fields propagating in a given equilibrium plasma configuration where both plasma density and magnetic field are inhomogeneous .",
    "the solution of the vlasov equation , coupled with the ampere equation , provides the electron distribution function and the electrostatic field in the whole spatial range @xmath0 , at any time .",
    "results are presented relevant to moderate amplitude electromagnetic field perturbations .",
    "let us consider a one dimensional magnetized plasma , localized in the region @xmath1 , homogeneous in the plane @xmath2 , with unperturbed density @xmath3 , and magnetic field @xmath4 the relevant dimensionless non relativistic vlasov equations take the form @xmath5 { { \\partial f_a}\\over{\\partial v_x } } - \\mu_a \\left [ e_y^{tot } - v_x b_z^{tot } \\right ] { { \\partial f_a}\\over{\\partial v_y } } = 0 , \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "normalized variables are defined as follows : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , @xmath13 , @xmath14 as a result , in our units , the normalized length scale is the electron skin depth @xmath15 , while the ( dimensionless ) electrostatic length scale , the debye length , is equal to the normalized thermal velocity , @xmath16 . in eq.([1 ] ) the components of the electric field are the sum of two parts @xmath17 , the consistent field , satisfying the maxwell equations , and the externally applied driving field , respectively .",
    "moreover , the magnetic field is also the sum of the constant background field and of the self - consistent field , @xmath18 .",
    "the self - consistent fields satisfy the maxwell equations : @xmath19 where the two relevant components of the current density are @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "finally , poisson equation ( used as a check in the code ) takes the form @xmath22 where the charge density is @xmath23 the driving electric field is modelled as @xmath24    where @xmath25 are constant amplitudes , @xmath26 $ ] is the position where the driving field acts ( usually , @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 is the pump frequency . the disturbance is switched on and off continuously , with a typical time scale @xmath29 .",
    "this model allows one to perturb the system at one boundary of the range @xmath30 $ ] either by an electromagnetic ( @xmath31 ) or by an electrostatic ( @xmath32 ) disturbance .",
    "the consistent polarization and wave vector are then defined by the kinetic plasma response , which comprises the nonlinear coupling between particle motion and fields contained in the vlasov eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "tests aimed at reproducing the wave - plasma interaction in the low - amplitude ( linear ) regime have been performed by injecting a `` pure '' electromagnetic wave ( i.e. @xmath33 ) at the left boundary , @xmath34 , with @xmath35 , or by exciting an electrostatic perturbation ( i.e. @xmath36 ) nearby the left boundary , @xmath37 , using a normalized amplitude @xmath38 . in all cases",
    "@xmath39 , which corresponds in dimensional units to @xmath40 . in dimensionless units",
    "the magnetic field is equal to the electron cyclotron frequency and the value @xmath41 has been chosen in all simulations .",
    "two values of the pump frequency have been considered : @xmath42 _ ( a ) _ and @xmath43 _",
    "( b)_. note that the upper hybrid frequency @xmath44 and the upper cutoff @xmath45 .",
    "according to the linear theory of cyclotron waves @xcite the cold branches of the dispersion relation of an extraordinary mode propagating perpendicularly to the magnetic field have a dimensionless wave vector @xmath46 and @xmath47 for two chosen frequencies , 2.1 and 0.95 , respectively . as it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the _ k_-spectra of the electric field manifest a sharp maximum around the corresponding wave vectors , together with other features at higher _ k _ s , independently of the method of excitation ( electrostatic or electromagnetic ) .",
    "moreover , since we are dealing with a hot plasma , we should expect also a component at higher _ k _ , due to the conversion of the incoming electromagnetic energy into electrostatic electron bernstein waves . in this respect",
    "the most interesting spectrum is that of case _",
    "( b ) _ , since the @xmath48 , where modes with @xmath49 should be excited .",
    "however , in this preliminary work where we deal with `` small '' amplitude external pumps and relatively short time of propagation , this effect is not seen . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot the longitudinal and transversal components of the electric field , first and second frame , respectively , in the case of an electromagnetic external driver of amplitude @xmath50 and frequency @xmath43 .",
    "we see that near the left boundary the energy is transferred to the electrostatic counterpart and then , after propagating to the right a few @xmath51 at @xmath52 , the amplitudes become nearly constant with @xmath53 , despite in we are in the limit @xmath54 where the electromagnetic ( applied ) field should dominate .",
    "we think that this is due to the warm plasma response . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we draw the isolines of the electron distribution function at @xmath55 in the ( @xmath56 ) phase space at fixed @xmath57 velocity , namely @xmath58 , first frame , and @xmath59 , second frame ( b ) .",
    "this figure shows the rotation of the particles around the magnetic field corresponding vortex like structures of typical size of the order of the selected @xmath57 value .    in the present analysis",
    "the value @xmath39 has been chosen , which corresponds to an electron temperature of @xmath60 .",
    "it is well known that in order to describe correctly the collisionless cyclotron waves propagating perpendicularly to the magnetic field , the velocity dependence of the electron mass should be considered .",
    "the propagation of cyclotron waves is however well described already by the non relativistic theory . moreover , for the frequency values which have been considered , that is @xmath42 and @xmath61 even in the relativistic case , no appreciable collisionless damping is expected .",
    "in this work the vlasov equation for electrons , coupled with the maxwell equations , has been numerically solved in an open plasma slab , where the source of the electromagnetic fields is localized at one of the two spatial boundaries .",
    "the magnetized plasma responses to both purely electromagnetic or electrostatic excitations , at small amplitudes , have been studied .",
    "the field disturbance is applied in the form of a purely transverse propagating em wave or , alternatively , as a purely es field .",
    "then , the injected em energy goes into the longitudinal and transverse components of the field , almost independently on the excitation details , and the wavevectors are generated consistently during the wave propagation .",
    "it is seen that , even in the case of a purely em excitation , a large fraction of the injected energy can go into the es field .",
    "one of us , fc , is glad to acknowledge the plasma physics institute ( ifp ) of milan for supporting in part the research activity on the kinetic study of electrostatic and electromagnetic waves propagation in a plasma .",
