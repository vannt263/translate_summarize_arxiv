    "we focus on collisions as they are expected to make significant modifications to the dynamics .",
    "the relation between the fraction of starlight absorbed by the dust and the collision timescale depends on the width and radius of the disk .",
    "a ring with radius @xmath2 , width @xmath3 , and optical depth normal to the disk plane , @xmath4 , has total surface area @xmath5 however at radius @xmath2 the starlight passes through a sphere of area @xmath6 . for low opacity systems the infrared opacity",
    "is related to the disk optical depth by @xmath7 we expect that the disk optical depth , @xmath4 , exceeds @xmath8 by a modest factor ( @xmath9 ) and that @xmath4 is the same order of magnitude as @xmath8 unless the ring is very narrow .",
    "the infrared opacity measurements allow us to crudely estimate the normal disk optical depth and so collision timescale in the disk , though when possible , direct imaging in the infrared can provide better measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "planets have been proposed to explain the morphology of a number of systems with dusty disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) , however most models do not take into account collisions between particles in the disk .",
    "the collision timescale , @xmath10 , for the smaller particles can be estimated from the optical depth , @xmath4 , normal to the disk plane , @xmath11 @xcite where @xmath12 is the mean motion at radius @xmath2 . as emphasized by @xcite , for most debris disks",
    "the collision timescale between particles is shorter than the poynting - robertson drag timescale and so collisions should be considered when interpreting the evolution and morphology of these disks .",
    "@xcite proposed that the steep inner edge of fomalhaut s disk might be due to the removal ( by the planet ) of particles scattered interior to the disk edge by collisions . while @xcite suggested that the chaotic zone near the corotation region is a likely location for disk truncation , this has yet to be tested by numerical simulations that incorporate both perturbations by a planet and collisions on a timescale consistent with that expected for debris disks .",
    "that is what we aim to do here .    for disk optical depths in the regime of debris disks , @xmath13 ,",
    "spiral density waves can not be driven at lindblad resonances ( @xcite ; this regime is also discussed in the context of planetary rings by @xcite ) .",
    "however collision induced angular momentum transfer causes a thin disk to diffuse radially and become wider .",
    "a particle ring has two characteristic timescales @xcite , the collision timescale , @xmath10 , that is related to the disk optical depth , and the diffusion timescale , @xmath14 , that depends on both the disk velocity dispersion and collision timescale .",
    "the radial evolution of an isolated particle ring can be described with a diffusion equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number density as a function of radius @xmath2 , ( e.g. , @xcite equation 48 and @xcite equation 11 ) .",
    "the diffusion coefficient , @xmath17 , depends on the collision timescale and velocity dispersion , @xmath18 , in the disk , @xmath19 this diffusion coefficient is similar to a viscosity and can be estimated by considering the mean free path and particle velocity differences set by the epicyclic amplitude ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as the collision time depends on the number density ,",

    "[ fig : rplotp3 ] , width=336 ]    in this paper we adopt a diffusive approach toward simulating the affect of collisions on a particle disk that resides near a planet .",
    "when the disk optical depth is low , many orbits pass between collisions . during this",
    "time particles can be integrated directly under the influence of only gravity .",
    "previous works simulating collisions adopt a statistical method for predicting when each particle suffers a collision and its affect ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or search for close approaches between particles and then compute momentum changes for both particles ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we adopt the first approach .",
    "we only perturb particles on a mean collision timescale and compute a perturbation to the particle s momentum .",
    "both the collision timescale and momentum perturbation are chosen independent of the particle distribution ( similar to the approach by @xcite ) .",
    "a more sophisticated simulation would allow the particle distribution to set both quantities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however this requires additional computational effort , either by computing close approaches carefully @xcite , letting the computed collisions depend on a numerical grid @xcite or integrating sufficient numbers of particles that the velocity distribution is well sampled @xcite .",
    "numerical integrations were carried out in the plane , using massless particles under the gravitational influence of only the star and a massive planet with zero eccentricity , @xmath25 , and semi - major axis , @xmath26 , using a conventional burlisch - stoer numerical scheme .",
    "initial particle mean anomalies and longitudes of perihelia were randomly chosen . in each simulation 1000 particles were integrated for @xmath27 planetary orbital periods .",
    "each particle suffers collisions with a mean collision rate set by the collision timescale .",
    "the parameter we use to describe the collision rate is the number of collisions per planet orbit , @xmath28 , for an individual particle ; @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is an planet orbital period .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 is related to the normal disk optical depth by @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "each planetary orbit the number of collisions is computed from the total number of particles in the simulation and the collision rate .",
    "the particles that receive collisions are chosen randomly from those integrated .",
    "these particles receive perturbations to their momentum at a randomly chosen time during the orbit .",
    "if a particle suffers a collision its radial velocity is adjusted to damp the energy , @xmath32 where @xmath33 . here",
    "we have set @xmath34 .",
    "had we not restricted our simulations to zero eccentricity planets we would have required the radial velocity perturbation to depend on the mean set by the distribution of particles . the tangential velocity is given a random kick @xmath35 where @xmath36 is chosen from a normal distribution with dispersion @xmath37 .    because the velocity perturbation at each collision , @xmath36 , is chosen from a normal distribution its expectation is zero .",
    "while total angular momentum should not drift rapidly , angular momentum is not conserved during the simulation .",
    "adjustment or redistribution of angular momentum following collisions would be required to conserve angular momentum ( e.g. , as explicitly described by @xcite ) .",
    "we do not chose to do this as we continually regenerate particles that have scattered outside the region of interest . to conserve angular momentum computational time",
    "would have been wasted integrating particles that diffuse away from the planet as well as toward it .",
    "our adopted procedure allows us to simulate a diffusive disk with minimal time spent integrating particles outside the region near the planet .",
    "particle initial semi - major axes were chosen to lie between 1.4 and 1.5 times the semi - major axis of the planet . this way the particles were allowed to diffuse from larger radius , approaching the planet .",
    "particles are removed from the simulation if they have a semi - major axis greater than 1.6 or less than 0.7 , have an eccentricity greater than 0.5 or are unbound and if they move closer to the planet than 1/10 of its hill radius .",
    "particles that are removed from the simulation are regenerated choosing their orbital parameters in the same way as the initial particles were chosen .",
    "this ensures that a constant number of particles is integrated at all times .",
    "the initial particle eccentricities were drawn from a rayleigh distribution with a mean eccentricity of @xmath38 that is chosen to match the velocity perturbation parameter , @xmath37 or @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the velocity of a particle undergoing circular motion at the radius of the planet .",
    "a particle in a nearly circular orbit with eccentricity @xmath41 has radial velocity component @xmath42 and tangential component @xmath43 . a distribution of particles with the same eccentricity and random mean longitudes and longitudes of periastron has radial dispersion @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this last expression accounts for the factor of @xmath46 in equation [ eqn : e_init ] .",
    "we describe and refer to simulations in terms of either the velocity perturbation , @xmath37 , or the mean initial particle eccentricity , @xmath38 , as they are directly related to one another .",
    "a steady state is reached after the disk has had time diffuse from the generation region ( at a radius of 1.4 - 1.5 ) to the particle removal region , near the planet s orbital radius .",
    "we checked that the radial velocity dispersion distant from the planet ( greater than @xmath47 ) is that expected from perturbations given to the tangential velocity perturbation at each collision or @xmath48 .",
    "this is consistent with a distribution of particles with a mean eccentricity of @xmath49 .",
    "because the radial velocity component is damped at each collision the mean particle eccentricity does not significantly increase past this value except near the planet .",
    "a density distribution is created from particle positions at the same time ( planet mean anomaly ) in each planetary orbit .",
    "we have added 1000 of these from different timesteps ( each at the same time in the planet s orbit ) to ensure that the density distributions are smooth and have a large dynamic range .",
    "we work in units of the planet s semi - major axis , @xmath50 , and orbital period .",
    "the mass of the planet is described in terms of its mass ratio , @xmath51 , the ratio of the planet mass to that of the central star .",
    "we describe the velocity perturbation @xmath37 in units of the velocity of a particle in a circular orbit , @xmath40 , or in terms of the associated initial particle eccentricity , @xmath38 .",
    "the simulations we discuss have parameters listed in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "we relate the simulation parameters to quantities that can be constrained by observations , the disk normal optical depth , @xmath4 , and the velocity dispersion that is related to the disk thickness .",
    "we have run simulations for three different planet mass ratios , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , two different collision rates , @xmath54 and @xmath55 collisions per particle per orbit corresponding to disk normal optical depths @xmath56 and @xmath57 and four different velocity perturbation sizes . in table",
    "[ tab : tab1 ] the velocity perturbation sizes are listed in terms of the initial mean eccentricity @xmath38 where @xmath58 and are related to the disk velocity dispersion by @xmath59 .    azimuthally averaged density profiles ( number density as a function of radius ) after equilibrium is reached are shown in figures [ fig : rplotp1 ] - [ fig : rplotc ] where each figure shows simulations with only one planet mass .",
    "a comparison of figure [ fig : rplotp1 ] - [ fig : rplotp3 ] suggests that the radius at which the particle number density drops is related to the planet mass .    in the collisionless",
    "restricted 3 body system there is an abrupt change in dynamics in the corotation region at a semi - major axis that we refer to as the boundary of the chaotic zone .",
    "the width of this zone has been measured numerically and predicted theoretically by predicting the semi - major axis at which the first order mean motion resonances overlap @xcite . in our figures we have with an arrow marked the chaotic zone boundary at a radius @xmath60 with the distance between the planet and chaotic zone @xmath61 @xcite for the different simulations .",
    "we see from the figures that this boundary is approximately the location at which the radial profiles suffer a drop near the planet , as would be expected from the change in the dynamics due to overlap of mean motion resonances @xcite .",
    "we note that the density drops before the chaotic zone boundary for the simulations with the most massive planets . the simulations with the most massive planet and the steepest profiles are also the ones that show the most structure . figures [ fig : c2gray ] and [ fig : f1gray ] display density distributions as a function of radius and angle for simulations c2 and f1 .",
    "we find for planet mass ratios equal to or below @xmath62 little structure is evident in the density distribution .",
    "however for a planet mass ratio of @xmath0 and low values of the velocity perturbation , structure at strong mean motion resonances such as the 3:2 and 3:4 resonance is present .",
    "when the resonances are strong trajectories can become planet orbit crossing .",
    "particles that diffuse into these regions are removed from the simulation causing structure in the surface density ( as seen in figure [ fig : f1gray ] ) and a reduction in the density profile at a radius larger than the chaotic zone boundary .",
    "this is likely to account for the density drop past the chaotic zone boundary evident in the profiles shown in figure [ fig : rplotp1 ] .",
    "number density as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath63 for simulation c2 with planet mass ratio @xmath64 .",

    "structure is seen in this disk associated with mean motion resonances .",
    "the 2:3 mean motion resonance is located at @xmath66 and the 3:4 mean motion resonances at 1.21 .",
    "both resonances are associated with structure in the disk .",
    ", width=336 ]    in figure [ fig : rplotr ] we show profiles for the 3 simulations with the same collision rate and perturbation but different planet masses and with radius rescaled by @xmath67 so that the @xmath68 and @xmath24 simulation chaotic zone boundaries lie on that for the @xmath23 simulation .",
    "in other words @xmath2 has been rescaled in this figure by a factor of @xmath69 . here",
    "we see that this radius does give an estimate for the radius at which a disk is likely to suffer a drop in density due to removal of particles by the planet .",
    "the rescaled profiles do not lie on top of each other ; the lower mass planet simulations have shallower profiles after rescaling .",
    "the disk slopes are not self similar after rescaling implying that the disk profile shape is not solely a function of the distance to the chaotic zone .",
    "the slope of the disk edge is dependent on the collision rate and perturbation size as well as the planet mass .",
    "in figures [ fig : rplotc ] , [ fig : rplotn ] , and [ fig : rplotd ] , we show profiles for the same number of collisions per orbit and collision velocity perturbation sizes but for different planet masses .",
    "the simulations shown in [ fig : rplotn ] have twice the velocity perturbation size and the same collision rate as those shown in [ fig : rplotc ] whereas those shown in [ fig : rplotd ] have the same velocity perturbation size but a tenth the number of collisions per orbit as those shown in [ fig : rplotc ] .",
    "we find that a larger change in the profile shape is caused by variation in the velocity perturbation parameter @xmath37 than variation by the same factor in the collision rate @xmath28 .",
    "so the chaotic zone boundaries for the three simulations line up .",
    "[ fig : rplotr ] , width=336 ]      we now discuss diffusive descriptions for the disk edge to better understand the parameters affecting the decrease in particle density near the planet .",
    "since the velocity dispersion is @xmath70 and @xmath71 we estimate that the diffusion coefficient ( equation [ eqn : diffusion ] ) is @xmath72 in units of the square of the planet semi - major axis divided by the rotation period , @xmath73    the diffusion equation for an isolated ring , equation [ eqn : diffusion ] , must be modified to include the effect of the planet . when a steady state is reached ( @xmath74 ) , a simple model is @xmath75 ( e.g. , @xcite ) where the right hand side represents the rate that particles are removed from radius @xmath2 because of perturbations from the planet .",
    "this term is expected to be a function of planet mass and distance to the planet but could also be a function of the particle velocity distribution or eccentricity distribution .",
    "we assume that there is only one important scale in the problem , the distance between the planet and the chaotic zone boundary , @xmath76 .",
    "we rewrite equation [ eqn : diffusionp ] with in terms of variable @xmath77 and assuming that the diffusion coefficient is independent of @xmath2 and @xmath20 , @xmath78 a simple form for the right hand side of equation [ eqn : diffusionp ] , describing removal of particles by the planet , would be @xmath79 when @xmath80 the solution @xmath81 with inverse scale length @xmath82 if @xmath83 , then @xmath84 is an airy function and if @xmath85 ( as might be expected from lifetime measurements in collisionless integrations ; @xcite ) the solution is a modified bessel function .",
    "these solutions also behave in an exponential manner with an inverse scale length that is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath86 .",
    "figures [ fig : rplotp1 ] - [ fig : rplotp3 ] , [ fig : rplotc ] - [ fig : rplotd ] show that the density profiles do approach an exponential form near the planet where the density gradient is steepest . in parameters related to our simulations",
    "we expect the inverse scale length @xmath87     , width=336 ]     but for simulations n1,n2,n3 .",

    "furthermore @xmath86 contains the unknown timescale , @xmath90 .",
    "the density decrement , @xmath89 , measured from the radial profiles , is plotted in figures [ fig : lsimsn2 ] and [ fig : lsimsn3 ] . as predicted by equation [ eqn : lexp ] ,",
    "our measured density decrement is consistent with a power law function of the simulation parameters . also as we expected @xmath89 increases with increasing planet mass ratio , and decreases with increasing collisions rate and velocity perturbation size . to measure the exponents",
    ", we have fit lines to the density decrements finding pretty good correspondence with the following function that is also plotted in figures [ fig : lsimsn2 ] and [ fig : lsimsn3 ] , @xmath91 this function implies that the inverse scale length @xmath92    a comparison between the measured scale length above ( equation [ eqn : lscale ] ) and the predicted by equation [ eqn : lexp ] reveals some inconsistencies .",
    "equation [ eqn : lexp ] implies that the length scale should be proportional to @xmath93 rather than @xmath94 as we find above .",
    "the above function measured @xmath86 combined with equation [ eqn : lexp ] would imply that @xmath95 in orbital periods .",
    "it is not clear why the removal timescale would increase with planet mass .",
    "had we used a larger scale for the distance than the distance to the chaotic zone boundary in equations [ eqn : case ] and [ eqn : lsqrt ] then the form of @xmath90 would have changed .",
    "it is expected that @xmath90 depends on the velocity perturbation size as we do expect the particle lifetime near the planet to depend on particle eccentricity , with shorter lifetimes or removal timescales at higher particles eccentricities .",
    "perhaps the particle lifetime depends on the collision rate because particles tend to diffuse to higher and higher eccentricity between collisions .",
    "our measured @xmath86 is not as strong a function of @xmath28 as predicted by equation [ eqn : lexp ] . a better theoretical model for both particle lifetime and diffusion",
    "is required to better match the measured exponents of equation [ eqn : lscale ] .",
    "the shallowest profiles displayed in figures [ fig : rplotp1 ] - [ fig : rplotp2 ] represent particle disks that have sufficiently high collision rates and velocity dispersions that a planet can not efficiently truncate the disk .",
    "it is interesting to apply our measured density decrement to estimate the minimum planet mass that can truncate a disk .",
    "we set a limit of @xmath96 ( corresponding to a density drop of 20 ) from the shallowest simulations and solve equation [ eqn : f1 ] to find the mass ratio of a planet that can not effectively truncate at disk of a particular collision rate and velocity dispersion . to truncate a low optical depth particle disk a planet must have mass ratio greater than @xmath97 or in quantities more directly related to observations @xmath98    the function ( equation [ eqn : mulim ] ) is plotted in figure [ fig : total ] for collision rates @xmath99 and @xmath55 collisions per orbit corresponding to disk optical depths @xmath56 and @xmath57 . instead of plotting this minimum mass ratio as a function of @xmath38 we plot as a function of velocity dispersion using @xmath100 .",
    "on this plot we also show a limit corresponding to the eccentricity of a particle that would allow a particle to cross from the chaos zone boundary to the planet s semi - major axis , or the limit @xmath101 .",
    "we refer to this limit on the plot as @xmath102 .",
    "it is interesting to compare our mass limit for disk truncation to that expected for an @xmath103 accretion disk .",
    "a gaps opens in a viscous accretion disk when the torque driven by spiral density waves excited by a planet exceeds viscous inflow or @xmath104 @xcite . here",
    "the inverse of the reynold s number , @xmath105 .",
    "we have plotted this function on figure [ fig : total ] for @xmath106 .",
    "a particle disk has effective viscosity set by the diffusion coefficient of equation [ eqn : dcoeff ] ( e.g. , @xcite ) , hence if our particle disks behaved similar to an accretion disk then this line ( shown as a thin dotted line in figure [ fig : total ] ) would like approximately on top of the dotted line for @xmath54 with @xmath107 .",
    "it is interesting that the disk truncation criterion scales with velocity dispersion in the same way as the accretion disk ; both require that the planet mass ratio exceed a constant times the square of the velocity dispersion .",
    "we find that a larger planet is required to open a gap in an accretion disk with equivalent viscosity to the diffusion coefficient in a low optical depth particle disk .",
    "this is somewhat counter - intuitive as spiral density waves excited by a planet carry angular momentum pushing material away from the planet and they can not be driven in a low optical depth particle disk . however collisions damp orbital eccentricity and high eccentricity orbits can be more quickly scattered by a planet .",
    "a lower mass planet might be able to truncate a particle disk because the long timescale between collisions allows particle eccentricities to grow near the planet .",
    "figure [ fig : total ] illustrates that for particle disks in the regime expected for debris disks , a neptune mass planet is sufficiently massive to truncate the disk , and if the velocity dispersion is low ( @xmath108 ) and the disk optical depth low , @xmath109 , an earth mass planet suffices .",
    "here we have not considered models with dust produced in resonance ( e.g. , @xcite ) but only allowed particles to diffuse inward toward resonances . in resonance ,",
    "certain angles with respect to the planet have longer removal timescales than others .",
    "effectively @xmath110 depends on the orbital elements of the particle distribution and the diffusion equation should be expanded to depend not on radius but all the orbital elements .",
    "individual resonances may play an important role setting the velocity dispersion disks near larger planets causing increased diffusion near the disk edge ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we expect additional complexity and structure if particles are produced trapped in resonance or if the system is not in a steady state .",
    "the simulations were run an average of @xmath111 orbits which is long compared to the age of some large debris disks .",
    "our integration times are long because we allowed particles to diffuse toward the planet from a moderately distant location and we ran each simulation sufficiently long to achieve a steady state .",
    "additional phenomena may be discovered in evolving systems .",
    "the simulations were carried out with a collision rate and associated collision induced velocity perturbation independent of position , however particles near the planet should have suffered fewer collisions because of the steep drop in density .",
    "particles in the disk edge should have also suffered larger velocity perturbations as the velocity dispersion increases nearing the planet .",
    "the velocity dispersion increase ( spanning a factor of a few for the largest planet ) is not as significant as the density decrease nearing the planet ( spanning orders of magnitude for the largest planet simulations ) .",
    "a more accurate simulation probably would have a steeper disk edge due to the decrease in collision rate near the planet and would have required longer to achieve equilibrium as a consequence .",
    "here we have adopted a diffusive approach toward simulating particle disks and neglected the role of the particle size distribution . if collisions are destructive then diffusion caused by collisions can still take place .",
    "however each diffusive step involves a destructive collision producing smaller bodies and these in turn have a shorter collision timescale .",
    "we imagine an effective diffusion coefficient that depends not only on local particle density but on the size distribution with the larger particles effectively having longer collisions times and smaller diffusion coefficients .",
    "the different sized particles also may have different velocity dispersions . in this case",
    "we would expect that the larger bodies would have smaller diffusion coefficients as the large bodies would have lower velocity dispersions .",
    "it is tempting though premature to predict that the different size particles would exhibit different disk morphologies as a consequence of their different collisional timescales and velocity dispersions .",
    "it is interesting to compare our simulations to imaging studies of debris disks .",
    "our lower mass limit ( equation [ eqn : mulimobs ] , see circle in figure [ fig : total ] ) is near but a few times lower than the previous limit set by @xcite for fomalhaut . as noted by @xcite the dynamics of low free eccentricity particles near an eccentric planet",
    "is similar to low eccentricity particles near a planet in a circular orbit , so we can extend equation [ eqn : mulimobs ] to low eccentricity planets .",
    "observations of fomalhaut s disk have not revealed any lumps or asymmetries in the disk , other than its eccentricity @xcite , consequently the planet mass must not be high ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "otherwise fomalhaut s disk would look like the disk displayed in figure [ fig : f1gray ] .",
    "consequently we also confirm , in a different way , the upper limit for the planet mass proposed by @xcite .",
    "in contrast , epsilon eridani s disk does show clumpy structure @xcite .",
    "if particles are produced outside resonance ( as explored here ) then we would infer that a moderate mass planet and low dispersion disk might account for the morphology .",
    "we have simulated the effect of collisions on a particle disk by introducing velocity perturbations into numerical integrations of particles under the influence of gravity from a star and a single planet .",
    "we find that the planet s chaotic zone boundary is an approximate location for the disk edge for disks that have optical depths in the range of observed debris disks .",
    "we find that density profiles do depend on the collision timescale but are more strongly dependent on the velocity perturbation size or velocity dispersion in the disk .",
    "the simulated disk morphology is axisymmetric and smooth unless the planet mass ratio @xmath113 and the velocity perturbation size @xmath114 . for higher mass ratio planets and lower velocity perturbation simulations structure is seen in the vicinity of strong mean motion resonances at locations where particles are more quickly removed from the simulation due to interactions with the planet .    from the simulations we have measured a density decrement describing the log of the density ratio of that close to the planet and that past the disk edge .",
    "the density decrement depends on powers of the planet mass ratio , collision timescale and velocity perturbation size . with a diffusion approximation this decrement represents a scale length that might in future",
    "be predicted with better understanding of particle dynamics near the planet .",
    "we have used our numerically measured density decrement to predict the mass of a planet required to truncate a particle disk ( equation [ eqn : mulimobs ] ) .",
    "the minimum planet mass required depends on the square of the disk velocity dispersion , similar to gap opening in an accretion disk .",
    "however we find that a lower mass planet can truncate a low optical depth disk than an accretion disk with an equivalent viscosity .",
    "the minimum planet mass also depends on the collision rate .",
    "as the collision rate is related to the disk optical depth and the velocity dispersion related to the disk thickness , equation [ eqn : mulimobs ] can be used to estimate the mass of an unseen planet from observations of debris disks .",
    ", ( related to the ratio of the density past the chaotic zone to that near the planet , see equation [ eqn : delta ] ) versus the log of the velocity perturbation size . only the simulations with @xmath54 collisions per orbit are plotted .",
