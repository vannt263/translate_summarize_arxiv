    "the alice experiment  @xcite studies nucleus  nucleus and proton  proton collisions at the large hadron collider , with the main goal of investigating the properties of the high - density state of qcd matter that is expected to be formed in pb  pb collisions  @xcite . according to lattice qcd calculations , under the conditions of high energy density and temperature reached in these collisions , the phase transition to a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) would occur , colour confinement of quarks and gluons into hadrons would be removed and chiral symmetry would be restored ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    the alice detector was designed in order to provide tracking and particle identification over a large range of momenta ( from tens of mev/@xmath1 to over 100  gev/@xmath1 ) , low material budget and excellent vertexing capabilities .",

    "pb run and shortly after it , the first results on the characterization of this state of matter were obtained  @xcite .",
    "these results are summarized in the present report .    in section  [ sec : detector ] , the alice experimental setup is briefly described , with emphasis on the detectors that were used for the results presented here , along with the data collection and collision centrality determination .",
    "the most fundamental measurement that characterizes the inclusive particle production is reported in section  [ sec : mult ] : the charged particle multiplicity density  @xcite and its dependence on the collision centrality  @xcite .",
    "this measurements provides information on the energy density of the system and , via comparison with models , on the gluon dynamics in the high - energy colliding nuclei . in section  [ sec : flow ] the elliptic flow measurement is described , compared to lower - energy data , and related to the hydro - dynamical properties of the produced system  @xcite . in section  [ sec : hbt ] the measurement of the bose - einstein two - pion correlation , that allows to characterize the spatial extension of the particle emitting source , is described  @xcite .",
    "the study of the suppression of the charged particle production at large momentum , via the so - called nuclear modification factor , is presented in section  [ sec : raa ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : outlook ] , an outlook is given on the ongoing analyses , which will provide further insight on the qcd medium properties .",
    "the alice apparatus is described in  @xcite .",
    "it consists of two main parts : a central detector , placed inside a solenoidal magnet providing a field of up to 0.5  t , where charged and neutral particles are reconstructed and identified in the pseudorapidity range @xmath4 , and a forward muon spectrometer covering the range @xmath5 . the apparatus is completed by a set of smaller detectors in the forward areas , for triggering , charged particle and photon counting , and event classification .",
    "the main results presented in this report were obtained using the following alice detectors : the vzero scintillators , the inner tracking system ( its ) , the time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "the two forward scintillator hodoscopes ( vzero ) are segmented into 32 scintillator counters each , arranged in four rings around the beam pipe .",
    "they cover the pseudorapidity ranges @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the its is composed of high resolution silicon tracking detectors , arranged in six cylindrical layers at radial distances to the beam line from 3.9 to 43 cm .",
    "three different technologies are employed : silicon pixel detectors ( spd ) for the two innermost layers , silicon drift detector ( sdd ) for the two intermediate layers , and silicon strip detector ( ssd ) for the two outermost layers .",
    "the tpc is a large cylindrical drift detector with cathode pad readout multi - wire proportional chambers at the two edges .",
    "the active volume is @xmath8  cm and @xmath9  cm in the radial and longitudinal directions , respectively .",
    "all data presented in this report were collected with a magnetic field of 0.5  t and a minimum - bias trigger requiring at least two out these three conditions : a hit in the spd , a hit in the forward rapidity vzero counters , or a hit in the backward rapidity vzero counters .",
    "this request selects about 98% of the pb  pb inelastic cross section .",
    "the instantaneous luminosity was typically of the order of @xmath10 during the pb ",
    "pb run and a total statistics of about 30 million minimum - bias triggers was recorded , in addition to high - multiplicity and ultra - peripheral collision triggers .",
    "nucleus  nucleus collisions are classified according to their centrality , which measures the number of nucleons that undergo inelastic scattering ( number of participants , @xmath11 ) , and is related to the initial extension of the system produced in the collision .",
    "several experimental observables , mainly measures of the number of particles produced in the collisions , can be used to categorize the events in centrality classes .",
    "figure  [ fig : display ] ( right ) shows the distribution of the observable that was used for the first analyses of pb ",
    "pb data collected in 2010  @xcite : the sum of amplitudes in the vzero scintillator detector , the response of which is proportional to the event multiplicity .",
    "the distribution is fit using the glauber model  @xcite to describe the collision geometry and a negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) to describe particle production  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the two parameters of the nbd , there is one free parameter that controls the power - law dependence of particle production on the number of participating nucleons ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the fit is restricted to amplitudes above a value corresponding to 88% of the hadronic cross section . in this region",
    "the trigger and event selection are fully efficient , and the contamination by electromagnetic processes is negligible .",
    "centrality classes are determined by integrating the measured distribution above the cut , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : display ] ( right ) .",
    "the multiplicity of charged particles per unit of pseudo - rapidity ( @xmath12 ) at central rapidity is measured using the silicon pixel detector , the innermost sub - detector of the inner tracking system , made of two layers with radii of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and with acceptances @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "tracklet candidates are formed using information on the position of the primary vertex , reconstructed with the same detector , and of hits on the two layers . in particular ,",
    "a tracklet is defined by a pair of hits , one on each layer , selected on the basis of their polar and azimuthal angles , so that the resulting tracklet points to the primary vertex .",
    "the cut imposed on the azimuthal angle efficiently selects charged particles with transverse momentum ( @xmath17 ) above @xmath18 .",
    "particles below @xmath18 are mostly absorbed by material .",

    "[ fig : mult ] ( left ) , this value is compared to the measurements for au  au and pb  pb , and non - single diffractive ( nsd ) pp and @xmath21 collisions over a wide range of collision energies . it is interesting to note that the energy dependence is steeper for heavy - ion collisions than for pp collisions .",
    "a significant increase , by a factor 2.1 , in the pseudo - rapidity density is observed at @xmath0  tev for pb  pb compared to @xmath27  gev for au  au .",
    "bjorken s estimation of the initial energy density in the system formed in the collisions reads : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the rapidity density and the average transverse mass of the produced particles , @xmath31 is the formation time of the system , and a is the mass number of the colliding nuclei , which estimates the transverse area of the nuclear overlap for central collisions .",
    "this relation and our measurement suggest that the energy density of the system produced at lhc energies is at least a factor of 3 larger than at rhic energies , considering the 2.1-fold larger multiplicity and the fact that the formation time @xmath31 is expected to be shorter by a factor of about two with respect to rhic energies . figure  [ fig : mult ] ( right ) shows the centrality dependence of the charged multiplicity per participant pair  @xcite , compared to the corresponding rhic measurement  @xcite , scaled by a factor 2.1 .",
    "the trend is very similar at the two energies and the mild increase in semi - central to central collisions is found to be better described by models that include a mechanism to tame the increase with centrality in the number of scattering centres .",
    "this suggests a certain degree of saturation in the phase - space of small @xmath32 ( fractional momentum ) gluons in the initial state of the collision .",
    "one of the experimental observables that is sensitive to the properties of high - density qcd matter is the azimuthal distribution of particles in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction . in non - central collisions , the geometrical overlap region and",
    "therefore the initial matter distribution is anisotropic ( almond shaped ) .",
    "if the matter is interacting , this spatial asymmetry is converted via multiple collisions into an anisotropic momentum distribution .",
    "this anisotropy is quantified via the elliptic flow coefficient , @xmath33 , defined as the second moment of the final state hadron azimuthal distribution , @xmath34 , with respect to the reaction plane , which contains the centres of the colliding nuclei and the beam line .",
    "the elliptic flow is a response of the dense system to the initial conditions and therefore it is sensitive to the early and hot , strongly interacting phase of the evolution .",

    "additionally , at least two of the six its layers must have a hit associated with the track , including at least one of the two pixel layers .",
    "a selection based on the distance of closest approach to the primary vertex was used to reject a large fraction of the tracks produced by secondary particles , from decays and interactions in the detector material .",

    "the figure shows that there is a continuous increase in the magnitude of the elliptic flow for this centrality region from rhic to lhc energies .",

    "this increase is higher than current predictions from ideal hydrodynamic models .",
    "the hydrodynamic models which incorporate viscous corrections and certain hybrid models do allow for such an increase .",

    "this product is connected to the volume of the homogeneity region . in central pb ",
    "pb collisions at @xmath2 we measured a product of about @xmath44 , about two times larger than at rhic energy .    within hydrodynamic scenarios , the decoupling time for hadrons at mid - rapidity can be estimated as follows : the size of the homogeneity region is inversely proportional to the velocity gradient of the expanding system ; the longitudinal velocity gradient in a high energy nuclear collision decreases with time as @xmath45 ; therefore , the magnitude of @xmath46 ( longitudinal hbt radius ) is proportional to the total duration of the longitudinal expansion , i.e. to the decoupling time of the system .",

    "the volume of the particle emitting source is found to be twice larger than at rhic energies . *",
    "the collision - centrality dependence of the particle multiplicity tends to flatten towards most central collisions , suggesting that some kind of saturation mechanism is at play for the initial - state gluon fields in the colliding nuclei . *",
    "the produced hadrons exhibit a strong collective flow , in agreement with the hydrodynamic models in which the system expands similarly to a liquid with very small viscosity . *",
    "high - momentum particle production shows a suppression by a factor of 57 , close to that observed at lower energy in the same momentum range , suggesting that the medium opaqueness to hard partons is higher at the lhc .",
    "the study of these observables for many species of identified particles ( baryons , strange , heavy - flavour particles , charmonia ) is well - advanced and opens the path for a detailed characterization of the quark - gluon plasma state produced in the highest - energy nuclear collisions at the lhc ."
