    "proposed wide - field imaging surveys will be able to discover and build light curves of thousands to hundreds of thousands of high - redshift type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) .",
    "sne ia are established as excellent distance indicators having been used for both for the measurement of the hubble constant @xcite and for the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "there is thus interest in exploring how supernovae in new surveys can be used to improve the measurement of the expansion history of the universe and provide further insight into the physical cause of its acceleration .",
    "although planned facilities and surveys provide straightforward harvesting of light curves for large numbers of supernovae , the corresponding spectroscopic observations used for redshift determination , supernova typing , and diagnostics are expensive .",
    "it is unclear whether there will be available spectroscopic resources commensurate to the production of the imaging .",
    "in addition , those surveys that target spectroscopy for a specific redshift range will still accumulate supernova light curves at other redshifts @xcite .",
    "there is therefore interest in the possibility of performing supernova cosmology analysis with photometric data only . in this scenario ,",
    "light curves not only fill their traditional role in measuring distances but are also responsible for supernova typing and redshift determination .    in this paper , we explore the feasibility of using survey photometry to simultaneously estimate distance and redshift using fits to a light - curve template .",
    "we do not incorporate typing and assume that the supernova is already known to be type ia .",
    "we use an effective distance - modulus uncertainty as the metric of interest .",
    "barris and tonry @xcite describe an alternative approach to the same problem using bayesian statistics and marginalizing over redshift , obtaining distance precisions close to the intrinsic corrected sn ia magnitude dispersion .",
    "other papers have considered other combinations of information derivable from photometric data only : johnson and crotts @xcite and kuznetsova and connolly @xcite for photometric supernova typing ; sullivan et al .",
    "@xcite for simultaneous typing and redshift determination with early light curves ; and wang @xcite for supernova photometric redshifts .",
    "the effect of supernova redshift uncertainties on the determination of dark - energy parameters is examined in huterer et al .  .",
    "this paper is organized as follows :  [ approach : sec ] describes our approach towards estimating distance modulus and redshift uncertainties for photometric survey data through light curve fitting . in  [",
    "spec : sec ] we specify the properties of the six surveys that we consider : all share a four - day cadence but have differing depths that correspond to obtaining a signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of either 25 or 50 for a fiducial @xmath6 , 0.731 , or 1.11 supernova at peak brightness in each band .",
    "interesting features of our results are discussed in  [ discussion : sec ] and conclusions are presented in  [ conclusions : sec ] .",
    "our objective is to determine how well the distance and redshift of a single supernova can be determined from a set of photometric data .",
    "we use a parameterized description of the time - evolving spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for sne ia incident to the observer .",
    "an individual supernova is characterized by the date of explosion and redshift in addition to the parameters of the sed model .",
    "the survey is described by the observing cadence , photometric noise , and bands of observation .",
    "model - parameter uncertainties from light - curve fitting are estimated using the fisher information matrix .",
    "these parameters are in turn propagated into a covariance matrix for the distance modulus and redshift .",
    "the covariance matrix is distilled into an effective distance modulus uncertainty to aid in the interpretation of the results .",
    "the fisher analysis provides a firm lower limit on the errors one can obtain : this limit is an excellent estimate of errors when the data uncertainties are small and gaussian distributed .",
    "salt2 @xcite provides an empirical model for the time evolving sed of sne ia .",
    "the model is constructed from a training set of spectroscopic and photometric measurements of both low- and high - redshift supernovae .",
    "salt2 models the sed as a function of phase @xmath7 and wavelength @xmath8 by @xmath9   \\times e^{c cl(\\lambda ) } \\label{saltmodel : eqn}\\ ] ] where the model parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 correspond ( approximately ) to the peak luminosity , light - curve shape , and observed color .",
    "the color parameterization simultaneously accounts for intrinsic supernova color variation and foreground dust extinction .",
    "the functions @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are constructed according to the training set .",
    "the model covers supernova phases from @xmath16 $ ] days and the wavelength range @xmath17 $ ]  .",
    "we work with photon rather than energy fluxes since they , combined with transmission functions , describe counter detectors and observer magnitude systems @xcite .",
    "the use of densities in @xmath18 rather than @xmath8 simplifies the description of redshifted spectra .",
    "the residual dispersion of the training set data from the model gives a quantitative estimate of how well salt2 represents supernovae .",
    "salt2 treats the dispersion of the template light curves of an average @xmath11=0 , @xmath19 supernova as @xmath20 where @xmath8 is the effective wavelength of the band in the sn - frame and the functions for variance , @xmath21 , and dispersion scaling , @xmath22 , are provided with the software distribution .",
    "correlations between the residuals within a light curve , though non - zero , are not quantified .",
    "dispersion in colors are given @xcite by a wavelength - dependent , phase - independent magnitude dispersion @xmath23    the survey data are described by the band of observation and photometric uncertainty . each supernova is observed with an undisrupted cadence in all bands .",
    "observations are tuned to provide a fixed signal - to - noise at peak brightness in each band for an average @xmath24 , @xmath19 supernova , and assume a sky dominated background for calculating the noise off - peak .",
    "this noise model approximately describes data from a ground - based rolling supernova search ( e.g. astier et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the supernova light curves are modeled using the salt2 sed model with the addition of parameters for the date of explosion @xmath25 and redshift @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the transmission of band @xmath29 .",
    "the complete parameter set for the light - curve model is @xmath30 .",
    "parameter uncertainties from light - curve fitting are determined through the fisher information matrix @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "every data point in all useful bands are included in the calculation .",
    "note that for the surveys we consider , photometric noise is independent of the light - curve parameters .",

    "the covariance matrix @xmath37 of the parameters @xmath38 is given by @xmath39    cosmological parameter fitting can proceed with the likelihood function dependent on the @xmath40 covariance matrix for each supernova .",
    "however , to avoid analysis of this non - gaussian likelihood and provide intuitive insight , we consider the limiting case where redshift uncertainties are small .",
    "taylor expanding the theoretical prediction of the distance modulus @xmath41 around the observed redshift , the probability distribution function to first order is gaussian with a @xmath42 for the one parameter @xmath43 with an effective variance @xmath44 ( see  [ sec : app ] for a sketch of the derivation . ) in this fashion , uncertainties in @xmath26 and their correlation with @xmath43 are incorporated into an effective uncertainty in distance modulus .",
    "we use the distance modulus for a photon - counting magnitude system that is related to the standard distance modulus by @xmath45 . as @xmath46 for most",
    "all cosmologies of interest , positive correlations in @xmath43 and @xmath26 increase the effective distance modulus uncertainty .",
    "we adopt a baseline description of salt2 and the supernova survey .",
    "the covariance matrix of the salt2 templates between points @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( with phases @xmath49 and @xmath50 observed in bands @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) is based on the residuals given by equations  [ residual : eqn ] and [ residualcolor : eqn ] : @xmath53 we have modeled the day - to - day correlations in the residuals with the @xmath54 function with a time scale of 5 days ; this keeps the intrinsic light curves smooth and provides both positive and negative correlations .",
    "residuals in different bands are uncorrelated .",
    "operationally , this covariance matrix of the model dispersion is added to that of the photometric data .",
    "we consider only data at supernova phases covered by the salt2 model ; observations around peak brightness provide most of the leverage in light - curve fits with our sky - limited background .",
    "observations are modeled as being made in the megacam @xmath3-bands of the canada - france - hawaii telescope with the transmissions provided with the salt2 software distribution .",
    "as salt2 is not well trained at wavelengths smaller than the @xmath55-band and as sne ia have little emission at these low wavelengths , we do not use observations in this regime .",
    "this naturally defines three specific redshifts to consider , @xmath56 , where the effective wavelengths of the @xmath57-bands in turn match that of the sn - frame @xmath55 .",
    "the sn - frame wavelengths that correspond to each observer band are given in table  [ effz : tab ] .",
    "the number of data points for each supernova is @xmath58 . at @xmath6",
    "there are a total 92 data points in @xmath3-bands used in the analysis . at @xmath59",
    "there are 90 points in @xmath60-bands and at @xmath61 74 points in @xmath62-bands .",
    "when the @xmath26-band observes the sn @xmath55 , there is no second band for a color measurement and the fit is not constrained .",
    ".supernova - frame effective wavelengths in microns for observer @xmath3-bands .",
    "the three redshifts in the table correspond , respectively , to matches of observer @xmath57 to the restframe @xmath55.[effz : tab ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     all results presented in this paper are calculated for the case where observations are phased to begin on the date of explosion . in the case of @xmath63 and",
    "no redshift priors , results vary by @xmath64% depending on the phase of observations with respect to the underlying light curve .",
    "there are several interesting features of our results that we discuss here in further detail .",
    "distance modulus and redshift measurements have significant positive correlation when there are no or weak redshift priors .",
    "the correlation is dominated by the contribution of @xmath65 .",
    "the positive @xmath66 is due to the supernova - frame @xmath55-band , where a strongly negative @xmath67 arises from the band coverage over the transition between the uv - flux dropout to the bright @xmath68 emission ubiquitous to sne ia . on the other hand ,",
    "salt2 predicts brighter uv flux for larger @xmath11 .",
    "the coverage over ca h&k wavelengths is therefore important for distinguishing supernova redshift and light - curve shape .",
    "the effective distance modulus uncertainty is more sensitive to redshift uncertainties at low redshift .",
    "for example , in the case of no redshift prior , @xmath6 and @xmath63 , the large value of @xmath69 makes it such that @xmath70 comes almost entirely from the @xmath71 term . the approximation derived in  [ sec : app ] to get equation  [ effmu : eqn ] breaks down as @xmath72 gets close to or larger than @xmath73 , which is certainly the case at low redshifts .",
    "by @xmath59 the effective distance uncertainty is dominated by the @xmath74 contribution and our approximation holds .",
    "the @xmath75 term does give the effective distance modulus uncertainty a dependence on the cosmological parameters .",
    "a fit could proceed using the full @xmath43@xmath26 covariance matrix , or iteratively with the values of the cosmological parameters updated using the fit from the preceding iteration .    without redshift priors ,",
    "the redshift uncertainties derived from supernova light curves range from 0.0110.025 for the case of @xmath63 .",
    "significant improvement in the cosmological utility of each supernova is possible with a comparable or better redshift prior .",
    "this is illustrated by the case of @xmath61 in table  [ sn25:tab ] . without priors ,",
    "the uncertainty in redshift is @xmath76 .",
    "when the redshift is constrained by a prior with 0.01 uncertainty , the resulting uncertainty in @xmath43 drops precipitously from @xmath77 to @xmath78 mag : @xmath79 ] .",
    "concern about redshift uncertainties are superfluous when spectrograph - quality redshifts @xmath80 are available .",
    "this shows why the propagation of redshift uncertainties is of little concern for experiments with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "it may seem odd that the covariance matrix @xmath37 gives smaller redshift uncertainties for the @xmath59 survey than for the @xmath6 survey , particularly since the latter has observations in four bands rather than three . by construction ,",
    "the two surveys give the same @xmath5 for their respective target redshift and both use comparable numbers of data points due to the extra time dilation experienced by the more distant object .",
    "qualitative comparison of figures  [ partial0.325:fig ] and [ partial0.731:fig ] shows that @xmath81 distinguishes @xmath6 from 0.731 supernovae . at the lower redshift , @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    "have almost identical shapes whereas at @xmath59 they are visibly different in the third band , allowing for tighter constraints in @xmath26 and @xmath12 .",
    "the fisher matrix calculation gives for @xmath6 : @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 and for @xmath59 : @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "differences in @xmath81 between the two redshifts are due to differing contributions from @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "this term reflects changes in the predicted observed light curves with redshifting of the supernova sed at fixed phase .",
    "( the phase dependent contribution to @xmath67 strongly resembles @xmath91 . )",
    "the different shapes and uneven @xmath18-spacing of the @xmath3-bands give redshift - dependent observed supernova - frame wavelengths .",
    "equation  [ redshifting : eqn ] is close to zero when the band covers the wavelength region with peak emission ; at shorter wavelengths it is negative and at longer wavelengths it is positive .",
    "the pronounced peaks in the @xmath47-band @xmath81 at @xmath6 and @xmath59 are attributable to their sn - frame wavelengths and the phase - dependent @xmath92 .",
    "we calculate @xmath70 for a series of redshifts from @xmath93  1.1 in steps of 0.05 for the cases of @xmath63 and 50 and no redshift prior , and show the results in figure  [ z - dmueff : fig ] .",
    "looking at the low - frequency behavior , at low redshift there is a dramatic decrease in @xmath70 with increasing redshift as @xmath94 falls . at redshifts greater than @xmath95",
    ", @xmath70 degrades as the number of usable data points and band coverage decreases .",
    "the high - frequency oscillatory behavior is due to differing coverage of the supernova sed by the observer bands and the resulting change in sensitivity to the light - curve parameters .",
    "comparison of tables  [ sn25:tab ] and [ sn25nonoise : tab ] indicates that photometry uncertainty in the @xmath63 scenario dominates over the uncertainty from the salt2 light - curve templates .",
    "the covariance matrices for the case of no redshift prior differ by a factor of two between @xmath63 and @xmath2 , rather than the factor of four expected if there were no salt2 uncertainties .",
    "selecting cadences of two , four , and eight days while keeping the peak signal - to - noise proportional to the square root of the cadence gives the same results within the second significant digit .",
    "degradation is expected at higher cadences as supernova phases with leverage ( large @xmath96 ) can be missed .",
    "extending the observer bands to include the @xmath97-band can help significantly for objects at high redshift . for a @xmath61 supernova with @xmath63 at peak",
    ", @xmath70 improves from 0.39 to 0.11 mag .    for the cases in this paper where @xmath98",
    ", we expect that a full monte - carlo - based fit would deviate from the fisher estimate by something in the order of 10 - 20% ; the broad wiggles in the supernova spectrum produce non - linear effects over this large redshift range .",
    "in assessing whether a photometric survey produces adequate @xmath43@xmath26 uncertainty , we set as a target achieving a @xmath70 comparable to the intrinsic sn ia magnitude dispersion , @xmath99 mag . at this point , it is more advantageous to spend time observing more supernovae rather than improving the statistical precision of each individual object .",
    "if relying on photometric information only , the observer can tune the depth of the survey to obtain the desired distance uncertainties .",
    "measurements that give better than @xmath2 at peak brightness for an average @xmath24 , @xmath19 supernova in each band with a four - day observing cadence would be necessary to meet the target @xmath70 out to @xmath4 .",
    "survey changes that hold fixed @xmath100 have almost no effect on @xmath43@xmath26 uncertainty for the finely sampled light curves considered in this paper .",
    "improvements in photometric quality give declining yields when photometric uncertainties are smaller than those of the sn model . for our simulated data ,",
    "sn model uncertainties begin to dominate between data qualities corresponding to our @xmath63 and @xmath2 surveys .",
    "work on supernova modeling is ongoing and improvements are expected as data with better wavelength and temporal coverage are included in template building",
    ".    a judicious selection of observer bands and/or targeting of `` magic '' redshifts can give data with stronger leverage in minimizing the @xmath43@xmath26 covariance matrix , as seen in figure  [ z - dmueff : fig ] .",
    "these occur when there are strong distinctive light - curve gradients with respect to the redshift of the spectra , allowing the breaking of the degeneracy between redshift and other parameters .",
    "shallower surveys can use the subset of supernovae with redshift prior uncertainties of @xmath101 or better .",
    "we expect that the patient or well - equipped observer can obtain spectroscopic redshifts of supernovae discovered out to @xmath6 .",
    "complete spectra for an unbiased sample of supernova hosts at higher redshifts will be more of a challenge ; for these , photometric redshifts can be used .",
    "photometric redshift uncertainties of @xmath102 for a galaxy subsample have been obtained with the cfht filter set @xcite and better performance can be obtained with the addition of a redder filter .",
    "a broader and non - gaussian dispersion is expected , however , for the diverse population of supernova host galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we do not consider biases in the salt2 model .",
    "biases in the distance and redshift determination leave irreducible uncertainties that impact cosmological parameter measurements .",
    "the size of the training set necessary for the salt2 model construction and in testing its performance is subject for further study .",
    "as supernova cosmologists concentrate on reducing the systematic uncertainties in using sne ia as distance indicators , focus is being placed on using light curves to distinguish variation in observed colors that are intrinsic to supernovae against those due to dust , and to determine the extinction properties of the host - galaxy dust itself .",
    "other intrinsic supernova parameters may be encoded in the light curves .",
    "in addition , we have not considered the impact of assigning the light - curve fitter the additional responsibility of determining supernova type . constructing a model for such a generalized fitter",
    "is difficult given the heterogeneity of core - collapse supernovae and the dearth of ibc light curves , although bayesian methods have been applied towards this problem @xcite .",
    "the formalism presented in this paper can be applied to future sophisticated light - curve models with an expanded parameter set . with photometric information diverted towards the measurement of additional supernova features , the uncertainties in @xmath43 and @xmath26",
    "can only degrade compared to the 3-parameter salt2 model .",
