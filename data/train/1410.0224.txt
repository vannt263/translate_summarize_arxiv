    "the crystal - melt interface ( cmi ) has a great relevance in materials science given that its properties have a strong influence in crystal nucleation and growth , as well as on wetting phenomena @xcite . despite its importance , the cmi is far less understood than the fluid - fluid interface because the former is difficult to probe with standard experimental techniques like x - ray diffraction @xcite .",
    "for example , it is well known that the interfacial tension of liquid water at ambient conditions is 72 mn / m , whereas the reported values for the ice - water interfacial free energy at ambient pressure range from to 25 to 35 mn / m @xcite .",
    "also the dynamics of the fluid - fluid interface is far better understood than that of the cmi @xcite .",
    "understanding the dynamics of the cmi is of great interest given that it can provide valuable insight to the important process of crystal - growth @xcite .",
    "the cmi interface is not flat , but rather exhibits relatively large undulations of the local interface position , or surface waves ( sw ) , as a result of thermal excitations ( see online movie @xcite ) . for length scales below the capillary length",
    ", sw are mainly governed by the interfacial stiffness and are known under the name of capillary waves ( cw ) . the equilibrium and dynamic properties of cw at the fluid ",
    "fluid interface have a long history and were already studied by smoluchowski and kelvin @xcite . for the cmi ,",
    "the study of the cw spectrum provides static properties , like the interfacial stiffness or the interfacial free energy @xcite .    at smaller length scales and higher frequencies , the surface of elastic media exhibit thermal excitations known under the name of rayleigh waves @xcite .",
    "these are small amplitude , high frequency perturbations that result from the elastic response of the solid .",
    "rayleigh and cw serve as a benchmark for the study of other surface phenomena in more complex materials .",
    "for example , polymer solutions and polymer gels , which are able to support both elastic and viscous response , exhibit a crossover from capillary to elastic sw @xcite .",
    "the cmi also appears as an interesting system for the observation of sw .",
    "the solid phase is elastic and could in principle exhibit rayleigh waves , while the fluid phase is viscous and could rather favour cw .    unfortunately , despite the fair amount of theoretical research in the field , there seems to be no appropriate theoretical framework for the study of crystal - melt sw dynamics .",
    "pleiner , harden and pincus extended the rayleigh theory in order to incorporate the viscoelastic response of polymeric materials , but did not consider polymers in contact with a viscous dense phase @xcite .",
    "the theory was later extended to study a dense fluid on an elastic medium , but capillary forces were neglected @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "jeng et al extended the kelvin theory to study sw at the interface of two dense fluids , but did not incorporate the elastic response of the solid @xcite .",
    "a suitable theoretical framework is in principle that of baus and tejero , who considered sw at the interface of two fluids baring simultaneously viscous and elastic response .",
    "however , the final results were worked out only for the special case of a vapour - liquid interface where one of the phases has negligible viscosity @xcite .    an alternative rather different approach to study interfacial fluctuations of the crystal - melt interface is employed in the field of crystal growth . the emphasis here is on the hydrodynamic equations of heat and mass transport , and energy dissipation is enforced by introducing gaussian random noise . in the limit of small temperature gradients ,",
    "this formalism provides a diffusion equation for the interface height fluctuations , and hence a strongly damped interface dynamics @xcite .",
    "computer simulations ( see e.g. ref . @xcite and references therein ) and experiments of colloidal systems @xcite have also been used to investigate the cmi .",
    "both approaches allow for the visualization of the cmi at a single - particle scale . therefore , these techniques are highly suited to improve our understanding of the cmi .",
    "many studies are devoted to obtain relevant static properties of the interface , such as the stiffness or the interfacial free energy , by means of an analysis of the spectrum of interface fluctuations ( e.g. @xcite ) . .",
    "the study of dynamic properties of the cmi , by contrast , has not received that much attention .",
    "the dynamics of the cmi has only been investigated by means of computer simulations for metal models @xcite and hard spheres @xcite , and experimentally for colloidal suspensions @xcite .",
    "not only there are just a handful of works dealing with the dynamics of the cmi but the results are in some cases contradictory .",
    "for instance , in simulation studies @xcite a quadratic dependency of the relaxation frequency with the wave vector is observed whereas the experimental work of ref .",
    "@xcite claims that such dependency is instead linear .    motivated by the importance of gaining a deeper understanding on the dynamics of the cmi we pursue in this paper a computer simulation study of the relaxation of sw for the cmi of three archetypal systems , namely hard spheres ( hs ) , lennard jones ( lj ) and water .",
    "we show that the relaxation of crystal - melt sw is well described by a double exponential given that there are different processes , characterised by different time scales , involved in such relaxation . as the wavelength increases only one process , the relaxation of cw ,",
    "is observed .",
    "we also show that .",
    "moreover , we compare the relaxation dynamics of sw for systems composed of molecules with ( water ) and without ( lj and hs ) orientational degrees of freedom . finally , following the methodology proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , we estimate the kinetic coefficient ( the proportionality constant between the speed of crystal growth and the supercooling ) from our measurements of the cw relaxation dynamics , and compare our results with independent measurements of such parameter .",
    "we simulate a solid in equilibrium with its melt and characterize the dynamics of the sw . to do that we first generate an initial configuration , then simulate the system at coexistence and finally analyze the trajectories generated in our simulations .",
    "below we give some details about this procedure .",
    "the first step consists in creating an initial configuration .",
    "snapshots of an initial configuration for lj and water are given in fig .",

    "in this paper we present a computer simulation study of the crystal - melt interface for three different systems : hard spheres , lennard jones and the tip4p/2005 model of water .",
    "we focus on the dynamics of surface waves .",
    "first , we generate an initial configuration in which a crystal slab is surrounded by its melt .",
    "the box geometry allows for the study of long wave - length capillary waves without having a prohibitively large number of molecules in the system ( see fig .",
    "[ snapshot ] for an example ) .",
    "then , we do molecular dynamics simulations in the @xmath6 ensemble at the melting temperature . the overall density of the system is comprised in between the coexistence densities of the fluid and the crystal phases , which guarantees that the system stays at coexistence throughout the @xmath6 simulation .",
    "the area of the box side parallel to the interface is chosen in such way that the solid phase is free of any stress .",
    "once we run the molecular dynamics simulations , we analyse the dynamic autocorrelation function of the surface waves modes ( eq . [ acf ] ) . to do that we first obtain a function that describes the profile of the interface , which we do by identifying the outermost crystalline particles of the solid slab .",
    "we carefully checked that our conclusions are not affected by the choice of the parameters needed to locate the interface ( fig .",
    "[ locate_interface ] ) or by the geometry of the box or the system size ( fig .",
    "[ tamano ] ) .",
    "we examine in detail the shape of the dynamic autocorrelation function as a function of the wave vector @xmath7 , and conclude that a double exponential function describes the relaxation dynamics of crystal - melt surface waves much more accurately than a single exponential ( fig .",
    "[ ajustes ] ( a ) ) .",
    "this implies that there are two distinct time scales , fast and slow , involved in the relaxation of crystal - melt surface waves .",
    "the slow time scale is due to the recrystallization - melting occurring at the interface , and is governed by capillary forces .",
    "the fast relaxation is due to a combination of processes that readily alter the shape of the interface .",
    "we speculate these may be related to rayleigh waves , subdiffusion of the fluid and the attachment / detachment of particles to / from the crystal phase . as the length scale of the capillary wave modes increases ( or @xmath7 decreases )",
    "the relaxation becomes increasingly dominated by the slow process and can be just described by a single exponential . within the uncertainty of our data",
    ", we see that the characteristic time for the slow relaxation process is related to @xmath7 by the power law : @xmath8 for all systems .",
    "this power law was predicted theoretically in ref .",
    "@xcite and checked in simulations of metallic systems @xcite and hard spheres @xcite , although the existence of a single relaxation process was assumed in these works .",
    "our results for hard spheres are clearly at odds with claims of a linear overdamped regime observed in the crystal  melt interface of colloids @xcite .    in addition to molecular dynamics simulations , we also perform monte carlo simulations for the hard sphere system .",
    "monte carlo and molecular dynamics simulations yield virtually identical autocorrelation functions if compared in diffusive time units ( fig .",
    "[ correl - mc_vs_md ] ) . .",
    "moreover , we compare the relaxation dynamics of different systems in diffusive time units .",
    "we see that the crystal - melt interface of water relaxes about ten times slower than that of hard spheres or lennard jones .",
    "we ascribe this difference to the presence of orientational degrees of freedom in the water molecules .    following the methodology proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite we obtain estimates of the kinetic coefficient ( the proportionality constant between the rate of crystal growth and the supercooling ) for all the three systems investigated .",
    "we find a good agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for hard spheres ( fig .",
    "[ compamini ] ( a ) ) . in our reduced units",
    "we can compare the kinetic coefficient for lennard jones with that of water .",
    "we show that a lennard jones crystal grows roughly ten times faster than a water crystal for the same degree of supercooling . from the kinetic coefficient",
    "we estimate the rate of crystal growth for ice at moderate supercooling . we compare it with recent calculations of such quantity obtained by a completely different approach @xcite and get a quite good agreement ( fig .",
    "[ growthrate ] ) .",
    "however , the linear dependence of the rate of crystal growth with the supercooling is restricted to fairly small supercooling .",
    "we also compare our results for the rate of ice growth with experimental measurements @xcite and show that the employed water model predicts significantly faster rates than those seen in the experiments ( fig .",
