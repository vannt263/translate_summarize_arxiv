    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are valuable tools to investigate the high - redshift universe .",
    "the extreme luminosities of their afterglows have allowed detailed studies of the physical properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of their host galaxies .",
    "in particular , in a few cases , the determination of their chemical abundance pattern has been possible @xcite , as well as the determination of a few quantities related to their host galaxies , such as their dust content , their stellar mass and their star formation rate @xcite . + @xcite first reported on the chemical abundances for the damped lyman alpha system ( dla ) associated with the host galaxy of grb 050730 .",
    "their analysis showed this gas was metal poor with a modest depletion level ( see also starling et al .",
    "these results were subsequently expanded and tabulated by @xcite ( hereafter p07 , see also delia et al 2007 ) and we adopt their values adjusted to the solar relative abundances of @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , for the first time we aim at determining the star formation history of some grb dla systems by analysing the chemical abundances measured in their afterglow spectra . for this purpose",
    ", we use a detailed chemical evolution model , which allows us to predict the evolution of the abundances of the chemical elements studied in the grb dlas of p07 .",
    "our aim is to constrain several relevant astrophysical quantities , such as the star formation rates , the dust content and the ages of the host galaxies of these grbs .",
    "our approach has already turned out to be fruitful to study quasar dlas on the basis of their chemical abundance pattern , allowing us to derive crucial information on their nature and on their physical properties @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly introduce the chemical evolution model . in section 3",
    ", we present our results and in section 4 we draw some conclusions .",
    "the model used to derive the star formation histories of these grb dlas host galaxies is similar to that developed by @xcite to study dwarf irregular galaxies . since some chemical species studied in this paper are refractory ( c , o , si , mg , fe , ni ) , in the chemical evolution model used here we include also a detailed treatment of dust production and destruction following the work of @xcite(cpm08 , see section 2.2 ) .",
    "+ we choose to use the model for dwarf irregular galaxies since several observational investigations provided strong evidence that most of the grbs originate in gas rich , star - forming sub - luminous ( @xmath3 ) galaxies with relatively low metallicities ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "+ the dwarf galaxy is assumed to form by means of a continuous infall of pristine gas until a mass @xmath5 is accumulated .",
    "the evolution of dwarf irregular galaxies is characterized by a continuous star formation history .",
    "the star formation rate @xmath6 is directly proportional the gas fraction @xmath7 at the time @xmath8 , according to the schmidt law @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the efficiency of star formation .",
    "we take into account the energy feedback from both type ia and type ii supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "they are responsible for the onset of a galactic wind , when the thermal energy of the ism exceeds its binding energy , which is related to the presence of a dark matter halo in which the galaxy is embedded ( for more details , see bradamante et al .",
    "1998 , lanfranchi & matteucci 2003 ) .",
    "the thermal energy of the gas is controlled mainly by the thermalization efficiencies of the supernovae explosions ( @xmath11 for sne ii and @xmath12 for sneia ) and stellar winds ( @xmath13 ) , which control the fraction of the energy restored to the ism which is converted to thermal energy of the gas ( see bradamante et al .",
    "the binding energy of the gas , on the other hand , is strongly influenced by assumptions concerning the presence and distribution of dark matter ( matteucci 1992 ) . a diffuse ( @xmath14=0.1 , where @xmath15 is the effective radius of the galaxy and @xmath16 is the radius of the dark matter core ) but relatively massive ( @xmath17 )",
    "dark halo has been assumed for each galaxy .",
    "the time at which the wind develops depends on the assumed star formation efficiency . in general , the higher the sf efficiency , the earlier the wind develops . +",
    "no instantaneous recycling approximation is adopted , i.e. the stellar lifetimes are properly taken into account .",
    "this allows us to compute in detail the contributions by low mass stars , type ia , type ii sne to the chemical enrichment of the ism .",
    "the main physical quantities related to these processes are the stellar yields , representing the fractions of processed matter restored by the stars into the ism .",
    "the stellar yields used in this work are from @xcite for low and intermediate mass stars ( lims ) , from @xcite for massive stars and from @xcite for type ia sne .",
    "we assume a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "with such an imf , it is possible to reproduce the chemical abundances and the observational features of dwarf irregulars @xcite and to account for the local metal budget @xcite .",
    "we assume a cosmological model characterized by @xmath18 , @xmath19 and a hubble constant @xmath20 .",
    "although n nucleosynthesis is still a matter of debate , most of n production arise from low and intermediate mass stars since massive stars produce only a small fraction of it ( e.g. chiappini , matteucci & ballero 2005 )",
    ". in particular , in the solar neighborhood the typical timescale for n enrichment should be 0.25 - 0.30 gyr .",
    "however , the n produced in massive stars is important for understanding n abundances at very low metallicities . in principle , n produced in massive stars should be secondary , namely produced by means of the cno cycle starting from the c and o abundances originally present in the star . in the last years meynet & maeder ( 2000 , 2002 ) and more recently chiappini et al ( 2006 )",
    "have shown that very metal poor stars can be fast rotators and that rotation can produce primary n , namely n originating from the c and o produced by the star , not those originally present in the star at birth . in this case",
    ", a high n abundance is expected at very low metallicities .",
    "it is not clear whether this high production of primary n in massive stars continue at intermediate metallicities . in our case",
    "we adopt the standard prescriptions for secondary",
    "n in massive stars and secondary plus primary n in low and intermediate mass stars .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show the predicted evolution of log(n / o ) vs time ( upper panel ) and vs metallicity ( lower panel ) assuming various star formation efficiencies . the models are computed with the nucleosynthesis prescriptions used here ( thick lines ) and assuming primary n in massive stars ( thin lines ) , following matteucci ( 1986 ) .",
    "the predictions are compared with the observed n / o values measured in high redshift qso dlas by various authors ( pettini et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) .",
    "the prescriptions adopted here are in good agreement with the most recent data published by pettini et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for dlas , whose metallicities are not as low as metal poor halo stars where a high n abundance seems to be found ( spite et al . 2005 ) . the assumption of primary n in massive stars predicts high n / o values at low metallicity , i.e. immediately after the beginning of star formation .",
    "however , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the highest n / o values in dlas can be explained also without assuming primary n production in massive stars , but by assuming a low star formation efficiency .",
    "+ without primary n production in massive stars , the value log(n",
    "/ o)=-2.6 , corresponding to the lowest value observed in dlas , is reached by our models after 0.05 gyr with @xmath21 gyr@xmath22 and after 0.1 gyr with @xmath23 gyr@xmath22 . finally , it is worth stressing that , as remarked also by chiappini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the stellar yields of meynet & maeder ( 2002 ) do not include the third dredge - up and hot - bottom burning , thus their n yields for intermediate mass stars should be regarded as lower limits .",
    "the model for dust evolution used in this paper adopts the same prescriptions as cpm08 . for a detailed description of the dust evolution model",

    "the value assumed here is also supported by theoretical studies of the local dust cycle ( edmunds 2001 ) .",
    "our assumption is compatible with values provided by other theoretical and observational studies ( see morgan & edmunds 2003 ) .",
    "however , other studies suggest that the dust condensation efficiencies of sne may be even lower , with values ranging from @xmath30 to 0.15 ( zhukovska et al .",
    "+ cpm08 showed that the dust depletion pattern is strongly dependent on the star formation history .",
    "the depletion pattern observed in galaxies of different morphological types provides us with the most complete set of dust depletion data for a range of different star formation histories .",
    "+ the refractory elements involved in this study are c and o which in the local ism show mild depletion levels , and mg , si , ni , and fe , which locally show higher depletion levels @xcite .",
    "a debate is currently open on the nature of s and on whether it may be incorporated into dust grains or not .",
    "observational studies of the depletion patterns of the cold ism of the milky way report for s depletion values between 0 and -0.2 dex @xcite .",
    "more recent data , based on observational determinations of the gas - phase abundances of some chemical elements in the local interstellar cloud , support a considerable depletion for s of -0.3 dex @xcite .",
    "however , these high depletion values have been derived by assuming as cosmic s abundance the solar value observed by grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) , i.e. @xmath31 per @xmath32 hydrogen atoms .",
    "the recent update by grevesse et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggests a solar s abundance @xmath33 per @xmath32 hydrogen atoms , which implies a s dust fraction in the local interstellar cloud lower than 0.4 , i.e. a logarithmic depletion higher than -0.2 dex .",
    "however , other indirect arguments indicate that s may have a refractory nature .",
    "detailed models of dark insterstellar clouds chemistry suggest that sulphur must be depleted by two to three orders of magnitude in dark regions @xcite .",

    "s is present in iron sulphide ( fes ) grains @xcite .",
    "a broad feature ascribed to fes emission has been recently seen in the infrared spectra of young stellar objects @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an indirect evidence of the fact that s may suffer depletion comes from the fact that its condensation temperature is considerably higher than the ones of c and o , which are known to be depleted in the gas phase ( see welty et al .",
    "1999 ) . from a photospheric abundance study of a rv tauri star in the large magellanic cloud ,",
    "reyniers & van winckel ( 2007 ) showed how the element abundance anti - correlates with the condensation temperature , possibly implying a correlation between the depletion and the condensation temperature . in the light of these facts , in our study we consider two different scenarios for dust grain composition . in the `` expected dust ''",
    "scenario , we assume that the only elements going into dust grains are ni and fe .",
    "the reason of the name chosen for this scenario lies in the fact that mainly indirect evidences indicate that s could be a refractory element .",

    "some of the predictions for the various models coincide across a large redshift interval .",

    "furthermore , @xcite showed that the integrated specific sfr , defined as the ratio between the comoving sfr density and the comoving stellar mass density , is a decreasing function of reshift .",

    "<S> long - duration gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are linked to the collapse of massive stars and their hosts are exclusively identified as active , star forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> four long grbs observed at high spectral resolution at redshift @xmath0 allowed the determination of the elemental abundances for a set of different chemical elements . in this paper , for the first time , by means of detailed chemical evolution models taking into account also dust production , we attempt to constrain the star formation history of the host galaxies of these grbs from the study of the measured chemical abundances measured in their ism . </S>",
    "<S> we are also able to provide constraints on the age and on the dust content of grb hosts . </S>",
    "<S> our results support the hypothesis that long duration grbs occur preferentially in low metallicity , star forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the specific star formation rate , namely the star formation rate per unit stellar mass , predicted for the hosts of these grbs with observational values for grb hosts distributed across a large redshift range . </S>",
    "<S> our models predict a decrease of the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) with redshift , consistent with the observed decrease of the comoving cosmic sfr density between @xmath1 and @xmath2 . on the other hand , observed grb hosts seems to follow an opposite trend in the ssfr vs redshift plot , with an increase of the ssfr with decreasing redshift . </S>",
    "<S> future ssfr determination in larger samples of grb hosts will be important to understand whether this trend is real or due to some selection effect . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare the ssfr of grb050730 host with values derived with a sample of quasar damped lyman alpha systems . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the abundance pattern and the specific star formation rates of the host galaxies of these grbs are basically compatible with the ones determined for a sample of quasar damped lyman alpha systems , suggesting similar chemical evolution paths . </S>"
