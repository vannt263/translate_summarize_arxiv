    "we consider a single colloidal particle immersed in an incompressible newtonian solvent of shear viscosity @xmath8 .",
    "the configuration of the system is described by the position of the centre of the particle @xmath9 and its orientation which , for an axially symmetric particle , is specified by the unit vector @xmath10 pointing along the particle s symmetry axis . on the colloidal length scales and for time scales typical e.g. for scattering experiments , inertia of the fluid and the particle can be neglected .",
    "the flow field @xmath11 around the particle is then described by the stationary stokes equations@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the force density the particle exerts on the fluid when subjected to flow , and @xmath14 stands for modified pressure field which includes the effect of gravity .",

    "higher - order moments are defined in an analogous way . in result of the external flow , motion",
