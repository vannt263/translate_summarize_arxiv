    "the large unexplained difference between the effective planck scale in the @xmath5-dimensional space - time ( @xmath6 ) and the electroweak scale ( @xmath7 ) , generally known as the hierarchy problem of the standard model ( sm ) , served as the main motivation for the emergence of theories of large extra dimensions ( led ) , also known as add theories  @xcite .",
    "they postulate the presence of @xmath8 extra spatial dimensions with sizes ( @xmath9 ) large comparared to the electroweak scale . while sm particles are bound to the ordinary @xmath10-dimensional space ( @xmath10-d brane )",
    ", gravitons can penetrate the additional volume in detriment of the strength of the gravitational field in the @xmath10-d brane .",
    "the hierarchy problem is solved , since the fundamental planck scale in the @xmath11-dimensional space - time ( @xmath2 ) , which could be of the order of the electroweak scale , is concealed by the large size of the extra volume : @xmath12 .",
    "the compactification of the extra space forces the gravitational field to populate only certain energy modes known as kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes .",
    "towers of these modes behave like massive , noninteracting , stable particles , the @xmath13 gravitons ( @xmath14 ) , whose production can be inferred in a collider detector by the presence of missing transverse energy ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "this review constitutes an update for a previous analysis  @xcite , where we searched for large extra dimensions in the exclusive ( monophoton ) channel @xmath16 in @xmath17 of data , collected with the 0  @xcite detector at the fermilab tevatron collider .",
    "the present study uses the same analysis techniques on @xmath18 of additional data . at the end",
    ", we present the final results as a combination of both analyses ( @xmath19 of data ) .",
    "recently , the cdf collaboration analyzed @xmath20 of data to set @xmath1 c.l .",
    "lower limits on @xmath2 , from @xmath21  to @xmath22  for two to six extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "searches for led in other final states have been performed by collaborations at the tevatron  @xcite and the cern lep collider  @xcite .",
    "a photon is identified in the detector as a calorimeter cluster with at least @xmath23 of its energy in the electromagnetic ( em ) part .",
    "the calorimeter isolation variable , @xmath24/e^{\\text{em}}_{0.2}$ ] , is required to be less than @xmath25 . in this equation",
    ", @xmath26 denotes the total energy deposited in the calorimeter in a cone of radius @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the em energy in a cone of radius @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the instantaneous luminosity , and @xmath31 is a constant that takes different values for the central ( @xmath32 ) and end - cap regions ( @xmath33 ) of the calorimeter .",
    "the track isolation variable , defined as the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all tracks that originate from the interaction vertex in an annulus of @xmath34 around the cluster , is less than @xmath35 . only em clusters in the central region of the detector with both transverse and longitudinal shower shapes consistent with those of a photon",
    "are considered .",
    "the cluster has neither an associated track in the central tracking system , nor a significant density of hits in the smt and cft systems consistent with the presence of a track .",
    "additionally , it is required that the em cluster matches an energy deposit in the central preshower ( cps ) system .",
    "the _ photon _ sample is created by selecting events with only one photon with @xmath36 , and at least one reconstructed interaction vertex consistent with direction of the photon given by the cps system . no jets with @xmath37 are allowed in the event .",
    "jets are reconstructed using the iterative midpoint cone algorithm with a cone size of @xmath38 .",
    "the missing transverse energy , which is computed from calorimeter cells with @xmath39 and corrected for em and jet energy scales , is required to be at least @xmath40 .",
    "the applied  requirement guarantees negligible multijet background in the final candidate sample , while being almost fully efficient for signal selection .",
    "events containing muons , cosmic ray muons , or tracks with @xmath41 are rejected .",
    "the em pointing algorithm uses the fine transverse and longitudinal segmentation of the calorimeter and the cps system to measure the direction of the em shower .",
    "it calculates the distance of closest approach ( dca ) to the @xmath42 axis ( along the beam line ) and predicts the @xmath42 position of the interaction vertex in the event independently of the tracker information .",
    "after standardized selection requirements , large backgrounds to the @xmath43 signal , which originate from cosmic ray muons and beam halo particles ( non - collision ) depositing energy in the calorimeter , are still present .",
    "the discriminating power of the em pointing variables help reduce this background significantly and very efficiently .",
    "the remaining non - collision events , as well as the contribution from @xmath44 events where the jet is misidentified as a photon , are estimated by performing a linear template fit to the data where we exploit the differences in the shapes of the dca distributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_1 ] ) .",
    "the procedure is described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "dca distribution for the selected events in @xmath18 of data ( points with statistical uncertainties ) .",
    "the different histograms represent the estimated background composition from the template fit to this distribution .",
    "the inset figure compares the individual template shapes . ]",
    "the backgrounds arising from the process @xmath45 , which gives the same signature as the signal , or from @xmath46 where the lepton from the @xmath47 boson decay is not detected , are estimated from a sample of monte carlo ( mc ) events generated with pythia  @xcite , and corrected for luminosity profile differences with data .",
    "additionally , we apply scale factors to account for the differences between the efficiency determination in data and simulation .",
    "@xmath48 background , where the electron is misidentified as a photon , is estimated from data using a sample of isolated electrons and the measured rate of electron - photon mis - identification .",
    "we generate signal events for two to eight extra dimensions using a modified version of pythia  @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : summary ] gives the final numbers for data and backgrounds .",
    "the main sources of systematic uncertainty are the uncertainty in the photon identification efficiency ( @xmath49 ) , the uncertainty in the total integrated luminosity ( @xmath50 ) , and the uncertainty in the signal acceptance from the pdfs ( @xmath51 ) . for the standard model background estimated from mc an uncertainty of @xmath52 in the cross section",
    "is also included ."
