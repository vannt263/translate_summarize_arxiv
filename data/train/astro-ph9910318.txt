    "the spatial and angular correlation functions , @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , have been extensively used to quantify the clustering of galaxies .",
    "the former has the important property of being the fourier conjugate of the power spectrum , @xmath12 , of the galaxy distribution ( e.g. peacock & nicholson 1991 ) .",
    "the latter is the two dimensional projection of @xmath10 on the sky and is related to it by the limber equation ( limber 1953 ; phillipps et al . 1978 ) . although @xmath11 conveys less information on galaxy clustering than @xmath10 due to its integral nature , nevertheless it is a powerful probe of the large scale distribution of galaxies , especially at faint magnitudes where redshift information is difficult to obtain .",
    "wide - area surveys at optical wavelengths have provided information on the large - scale structure at redshifts @xmath13 ( loveday et al .",
    "1995 ; maddox et al .",
    "additionally , deep optical and near - infrared samples over smaller areas ( villumsen et al .",
    "1997 ; hudon et al .",
    "1996 ; roche et al .",
    "1998a , b ; carlberg et al .",
    "1997 ) give useful information on the large - scale distribution of galaxies at higher redshifts ( @xmath141.0 ) .",
    "there is a general consensus that at optical wavelengths , @xmath11 is a power law of the form @xmath15 , with @xmath16 ( maddox et al .",
    "the amplitude , @xmath17 , decreases with increasing depth of the survey , while there is also evidence that the slope , @xmath8 , flattens at faint magnitudes ( infante & pritchet 1995 ) .",
    "the spatial correlation function has the form @xmath18 , where the correlation length , @xmath19 , is found to be @xmath20h@xmath7mpc ( davis & peebles 1983 ) .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated that early - type galaxies are more clustered ( higher values of @xmath19 ) than late types and that lower luminosity galaxies are a factor of @xmath21 less clustered than their brighter counterparts of the same hubble type ( loveday et al .",
    "there is also evidence that @xmath19 decreases with increasing depth of the survey ( infante & pritchet 1995 ) , due to the presence of a population of weakly clustered faint galaxies .",
    "radio surveys , unlike the optical ones , are not affected by galactic dust extinction and mainly consist of high redshift objects ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "therefore , they sample much larger volumes than optically selected samples , albeit with sparser coverage , providing the opportunity to study the clustering of matter at much larger physical scales",
    ". however , the broad luminosity function of extragalactic radio sources ( condon 1984 ; dunlop & peacock 1990 ) implies that a flux density - limited sample spans a wide range of redshifts .",
    "the projection on the sky of all detected objects results in a distribution close to random , smearing out any information on the large - scale structure .",
    "this is supported by the fact that no signal has been detected in the angular ( 2-d ) correlation analysis of bright radio galaxies ( webster 1976 ; masson 1979 ) . however , shaver & pierre ( 1989 ) found evidence of anisotropic distribution of radio sources towards the supergalactic plane extending out to at least @xmath230.02 .",
    "more recently , a clustering length of @xmath24h@xmath7mpc was estimated at 1.4ghz from the spatial ( 3-d ) correlation analysis of radio sources having flux densities @xmath25jy and redshifts in the range @xmath26 ( peacock & nicholson 1991 ) .",
    "cress et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have suggested that at lower flux densities , projection effects may become less significant and hence , a 2-d correlation analysis can be applied successfully to investigate the clustering of radio galaxies .",
    "indeed , a non - zero amplitude has been found for the angular correlation function of radio sources with @xmath27mjy in both the green bank ( northern hemisphere ) and the parkes - mit - nrao ( southern hemisphere ) 4.85ghz sky surveys ( loan , wall & lahav 1997 ; kooiman , burns & klypin 1995 ) .",
    "more recently , using the first radio survey ( 1.4ghz ; becker , white & helfand 1995 ) , with a uniform sensitivity of 1mjy over an area of 1500deg@xmath1 , a non - zero and clearly significant amplitude for the angular correlation function is estimated ( cress et al . 1996 ) . adopting the radio luminosity functions ( rlf ) determined independently by condon ( 1984 ) and dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) , cress et al .",
    "( 1997 ) inferred a clustering length of @xmath19=6 - 8h@xmath7mpc for @xmath281mjy radio sources .",
    "the recent large - area radio surveys described above , have provided information on the two - dimensional projected distribution of relatively bright ( @xmath291mjy ) radio sources , dominated by bright ellipticals and agns . however , there is still limited information on the clustering properties of the faint ( sub - mjy ) radio population . at flux densities below few mjy",
    "there is evidence for the appearance of a new population of faint radio sources , likely to comprise a large fraction of starbursts ( benn et al .",
    "1993 ; georgakakis et al .",
    "in particular , the radio luminosity function models developed by condon ( 1984 ) predict that the surface density of starbursts increases from @xmath30 of the radio population at @xmath31mjy to over @xmath32 at @xmath33mjy .",
    "moreover , studies of the spatial distribution of starbursts , selected at optical and infrared wavelengths , show that these objects are expected to have different clustering properties ( davis & geller 1976 ; giovanelli et al .",
    "1986 ; saunders , rowan - robinson & lawrence 1992 ; loveday et al .",
    "1995 ) compared to those of early - type galaxies , with which bright radio sources are often associated .",
    "therefore , study of the angular correlation function at sub - mjy flux density levels has the potential to reveal differences in the clustering properties of the faint radio population .",
    "recently , benn & wall ( 1995 ) demonstrated that the isotropy ( or anisotropy ) in the radio source counts in different fields of similar geometry and sensitivity can be used to set limits on the scale of the largest cellular structures in the universe .",
    "however , they argued that at sub - mjy and @xmath34jy flux densities , such a study is hampered by the small number of comparable surveys and by the small number of sources detected in each field .",
    "this is also supported by windhorst et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , who reviewed the field - to - field variations in the radio source counts of small area radio surveys ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "they concluded that the differences , although exceeding the random distribution expectation , are due to statistical fluctuations , rather than of cosmic nature .",
    "nevertheless , a non - uniform angular correlation function was estimated by oort ( 1987a ) for the radio sources detected in the deep ( @xmath36mjy ) lynx fields ( oort 1987b ) .",
    "more recently , richards et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also reported the detection of clustering signal for radio sources brighter than @xmath37jy , detected within a @xmath38arcmin diameter radio survey ( 1.4ghz ) centred on the hdf .",
    "the phoenix radio ( 1.4ghz ) survey , covering an area of 3.14deg@xmath1 , larger than any other survey at a similar flux density limit ( @xmath39mjy ) and reaching surface densities @xmath40 , provides a unique opportunity to study the clustering properties of the faint radio population . in this paper the angular correlation function of the radio sources detected in the phoenix field is estimated .",
    "section 2 gives a brief description of the observations .",
    "the method for calculating @xmath11 is outlined in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we estimate the correlation function of the radio sample .",
    "section 5 presents the simulations carried out to investigate the significance of our results , while in section 6 the correlation function amplitudes are compared with 3-d clustering models .",
    "the results from the radio correlation analysis are discussed in section 7 .",
    "finally , we summarise our conclusions in section 8 .",
    "the phoenix survey has been performed at 1.4ghz using the 6a configuration of the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "it is a mosaic of 30 pointing centres covering a @xmath41 diameter field centred at @xmath42 ; @xmath43 .",
    "the final synthesised beam size is @xmath08arcsec .",
    "details of the observation , data reduction , source detection and catalogue generation are presented in hopkins et al .",
    "a source is included in the sample if its peak flux density is 4@xmath3 above the local rms and if it survives visual inspection .",
    "there are two sources of incompleteness in the catalogue , as with any peak flux density limited sample .",
    "the first is a result of the attenuation of the primary beam sensitivity away from a field centre .",
    "this effect has been minimised in the phoenix survey by the mosaicing strategy used .",
    "the second is the fact that extended objects with a total flux density above the survey limit can be missed by a source detection algorithm which initially detects candidates based on their peak flux densities .",
    "these effects have been described in hopkins et al .",
    "the catalogue is estimated to be @xmath44 complete to 0.3mjy , and @xmath45 complete to 0.4mjy . therefore to minimise the effect of incompleteness",
    "when performing the correlation analysis , we restrict ourselves to a subsample containing all sources brighter than 0.4mjy .",
    "the two - point angular correlation function , @xmath11 , is defined as the joint probability @xmath46 of finding sources within the solid angle elements @xmath47 and @xmath48 , separated by an angle  @xmath49 , in the form    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the mean surface density of galaxies . for a random distribution of sources @xmath11=0 .",
    "therefore , the angular correlation function provides a measure of galaxy density excess over that expected for a random distribution .",
    "various methods for estimating @xmath11 have been introduced , as discussed by infante ( 1994 ) . in the present study ,",
    "a source is taken as the ` centre ' and the number of pairs within annular rings is counted . to account for the edge effects , monte",
    "carlo techniques are used by placing random points within the area of the survey .",
    "the most commonly used estimators in this procedure have the form    @xmath52    @xmath53    where dd and dr are respectively the number of sources and random points computed at separations @xmath49 and @xmath54 from a given galaxy .",
    "similarly , rr is the number of random points within the angular interval @xmath49 to @xmath54 from a given random point .",
    "infante ( 1994 ) and hewett ( 1982 ) emphasised the importance of correcting for any spurious cross correlation between the random and the galaxy catalogues when using the above estimators , arising partly because of the anisotropic and inhomogeneous galaxy distribution relative to the field boundaries .",
    "the corrected form of the estimator is then    @xmath55    where rd is the number of random - data pairs , taking the random points as centres ( infante 1994 ) .",
    "landy & szalay ( 1993 , hereafter ls ) introduced the estimator    @xmath56    the advantages of this estimator is that it minimises the variance of @xmath11 and also reduces the edge effects from which both the estimators ( [ eq_3 ] ) and ( [ eq_4 ] ) suffer .",
    "moreover , it has similar properties ( landy & szalay 1993 ) to that introduced by hamilton ( 1993 )    @xmath57    in the present study the correlation function has been calculated using estimators ( [ eq_4 ] ) , ( [ eq_5 ] ) and ( [ eq_6 ] ) .",
    "the results agree within the respective uncertainties .",
    "therefore , only the results from the ls estimator are presented .    for a given radio galaxy sample ,",
    "a total of 100 random catalogues were generated , each having the same number of points as the original data set .",
    "the random sets were cross - correlated with the galaxy catalogue , giving an average value for @xmath11 at each angular separation . in producing random sets of points , we take into account variations in sensitivity , which might affect the correlation function estimate .",
    "the flux density threshold for detection depends on the local rms noise which varies across the survey area .",
    "since the random fields are expected to have the same sources of bias as the data ( i.e. the simulated catalogues must have the same selection effects as the real catalogue ) , the rms noise map , with a resolution of @xmath010arcsec , is used to discard simulated points in noisy areas .",
    "this is accomplished , to the first approximation , by assigning a flux density to random points using the windhorst et al .",
    "( 1985 ) log@xmath51-log@xmath58 distribution , following the method of cress et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . if the flux density of the random point is less than 4 times the local rms noise ,",
    "the point is excluded from the random data set . however , producing random points with a uniform distribution over the observed area does not change our final result .    the uncertainty in @xmath59(@xmath49 ) is determined using both poisson statistics and 50 bootstrap resamples of the data ( ling , frenk and barrow 1986 ) . for the latter method ,",
    "simulated data - sets were generated by sampling n points with replacement from the true data - set of n points .",
    "the correlation function is then calculated for each of the bootstrap samples , following the same procedure as that with the original data - set .",
    "the standard deviation around the mean is then used to estimate the uncertainty in the correlation function .",
    "although the ls estimator used here is shown to have poissonian variance for uncorrelated points ( landy & szalay 1993 ) , it does not necessarily behave this way for correlated data .",
    "the bootstrap method is believed to give a more representative estimate of the uncertainty associated with @xmath11 . however , fisher et al .",
    "( 1994 ) carried out a detailed study of the biases affecting the bootstrap errors ( e.g. cosmic variance , sparse sampling by galaxies of the underlying density distribution ) and concluded that overall the bootstrap uncertainties overestimate the true errors .",
    "nevertheless , the bootstrap resampling is a general method for assessing the accuracy of the angular correlation function estimator and it will be used here to calculate the formal errors .",
    "the uncertainty associated with @xmath11 , estimated by the bootstrap resampling technique , is found to be about three times larger than the poisson estimate .",

    "loan , wall & lahav ( 1997 ) , using two large - area 4.85ghz radio surveys covering @xmath63 of the sky , conclude that the 2-d distribution of radio sources brighter than 50mjy is consistent with a correlation length in the range @xmath64 h@xmath7mpc and an evolution parameter @xmath65 .",

    "this scenario is supported by photometric and spectroscopic studies revealing that the sub - mjy radio sources can be identified with galaxies exhibiting evidence of increased star formation ( benn et al .",
    "1993 ; windhorst et al . 1985 ) .",
    "furthermore , studies of local galaxies with enhanced star formation ( late spirals , iras galaxies , hii galaxies ) , has shown that those objects are more weakly clustered ( @xmath692 - 4h@xmath7mpc , for @xmath70 ; davis & geller 1976 ; giovanelli et al .",
    "1986 ; saunders , rowan - robinson & lawrence 1992 ) than e / s0 galaxies .",
    "this implies that the sub - mjy population could be more weakly clustered than the e / s0 objects that host the majority of apparently brighter radio sources .",
    "support for this view was advanced by cress et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who found that the slope of the angular correlation function of the sources with 1@xmath71mjy is flatter compared to that found for @xmath283mjy .",
    "they interpret this result as being due to the increased contribution from starburst galaxies at lower flux density limits , which have flatter angular correlation functions compared to ellipticals , which dominate at brighter flux densities . a similar argument",
    "is used by peacock ( 1997 ) to explain the apparent conflict between the value of @xmath726.5h@xmath7mpc found for a sample of radio sources brighter than 2.5mjy and the value @xmath7211h@xmath7mpc found by peacock & nicholson ( 1991 ) for sources brighter than 500mjy and redshifts in the range @xmath26 .    to explore further the implications of the two scales of clustering , and in particular to explore the potential to eliminate competing models by observations ,",
    "the amplitude of the angular correlation function was estimated , by adopting a simple model ( model @xmath73 ) in which the radio population consists of two components , one dominating at brighter ( @xmath741mjy ) fluxes , with correlation length @xmath24h@xmath7mpc ( @xmath8=1.8 ) and the other dominating at sub - mjy levels with @xmath75h@xmath7mpc ( @xmath8=1.8 ) similar to that found for local starburst galaxies .",
    "any cross - correlation between the two radio populations is ignored .",
    "the clustering evolution parameter is taken to be @xmath5=-1.2 and our rlf model 2 is employed to predict the redshift distribution of the two radio populations at faint flux densities . in figure [ fig_10 ]",
    "we plot the flux density cutoff against the amplitude of the angular correlation function calculated from model @xmath73 . for comparison ,",
    "the expected relation assuming the same value of @xmath24h@xmath7mpc ( @xmath8=1.8 ) for the two populations ( model @xmath76 ) , is also plotted , along with the upper limits for the angular correlation amplitudes , @xmath17 , calculated in the present study for different flux density cutoffs .",
    "the uncertainties are too large to allow discrimination between the two models .",
    "it is an interesting exercise to predict the depth and the solid angle subtended by a radio survey that would reveal at a 3@xmath3 significance level if the clustering properties of faint radio sources were significantly different from those of the brighter ones as a result of the changing population .",
    "this is accomplished by estimating the uncertainty in @xmath17 for a survey of a given solid angle and completeness limit , as described in appendix a. this then is compared to the difference @xmath77 between the correlation amplitudes predicted at the same flux density cutoff from models @xmath73 and @xmath76 . to discriminate between the two models at a 3@xmath3 confidence level , the uncertainty in @xmath17 should be 3 times smaller than @xmath77 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig_11 ] , where the flux density cutoff is plotted against the uncertainty in @xmath17 for different survey areas .",
    "the solid line delimits the area in the parameter space in which @xmath78 is at least 3 times smaller than @xmath77 and hence defines the locus of 3@xmath3 confidence level discrimination between the simplified models @xmath73 and @xmath76 .",
    "we conclude that either a very deep survey ( @xmath79=40@xmath34jy ) over @xmath80deg@xmath1 or a survey over a larger area at a brighter limit ( e.g. at @xmath79=0.2mjy over @xmath81deg@xmath1 ) is required to discriminate between models @xmath73 and @xmath76 and thus reveal if there exists a weakly clustered radio population at faint flux densities .",
    "our analysis shows that the first radio survey , ( @xmath82mjy ) covering , at the moment , an area of @xmath83deg@xmath1 , is also appropriate for this purpose .",
    "using a deep , homogeneous survey covering an area of @xmath84deg@xmath1 , we have investigated the clustering properties of faint ( sub - mjy ) radio sources by calculating the angular correlation function of the sample .",
    "simulations have been carried out to investigate the significance of our results .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the amplitudes estimated here imply a non - uniform distribution of radio sources , albeit at the 2@xmath3 significance level .",
    "furthermore , we find that the correlation amplitude upper limits estimated here , despite the large uncertainties , are consistent with the results derived in other studies from larger samples at brighter flux density limits .",
    "spectroscopic and photometric studies of sub - mjy radio sources show that the majority have properties similar to starburst galaxies . since local galaxies , with increased star formation , exhibit weaker clustering than average , it is tempting to link the clustering properties of the sub - mjy population with those of local starburst galaxies .",
    "however , the present data , due to small number statistics , can not reveal a change in radio source clustering properties with flux density .",
    "nevertheless , we have demonstrated that future surveys having sensitivities at @xmath34jy flux density levels and covering large areas on the sky , will be suitable to explore possible changes of the correlation amplitude with flux density .",

    "the uncertainty in the amplitude of the angular correlation function of a fiducial radio survey with limiting flux density @xmath79 , subtended over a solid angle @xmath85 , is estimated here . to simplify the procedure ,",
    "the following assumptions are made :    1 .",
    "the area subtended by the survey has a circular geometry ; 2 .",
    "the angular correlation function of radio sources is a power law of the form @xmath86 , with the index @xmath87 being fixed ; 3 .",
    "the values of @xmath11 at different angular separations are uncorrelated ; 4 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath11 follows poisson statistics ( peebles 1980 ) and is given by + @xmath88 + where dd is the number of data - data pairs with angular separations @xmath49 and @xmath89 , @xmath51 is the number of sources above the flux density limit and @xmath90 is the mean value of solid angle subtended by annuli with inner and outer radii @xmath49 and @xmath89 respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath90 is affected by the field boundaries . in the present study , this is estimated by creating simulated catalogues of sources distributed randomly over the area of the survey and calculating the expected number of random points , rr , with separations @xmath49 to @xmath89 .",

    "the former is taken to be 3@xmath99 and the latter is set three times smaller than the radius of the survey , while it can not be larger than 1@xmath100 .",
    "this is because in real surveys one needs to minimise the effects of field boundaries when estimating @xmath17 . additionally , one is interested in the value of @xmath17 on small scales , while for larger scales the angular correlation function may deviate from a power law .",
