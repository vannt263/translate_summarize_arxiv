    "the structure and the reactivity of solid surfaces have become major subjects of study in chemistry and condensed matter physics , and are at the core of much of the research conducted in materials science . in this",
    "context , electronic structure methods , in particular density functional theory ( dft ) calculations , have played a fundamental role in the interpretation and the validation of the data coming from the different surface spectroscopies and microscopies , often providing new insights on top of those detaching from the available experimental techniques.@xcite throughout the past two decades a large number of dft simulations has been reported on metallic and semiconducting surfaces , contributing precious information concerning atomic and electronic structure , thermodynamics , and reactivity.@xcite@xmath1@xcite with very few exceptions , these simulations considered a slab in the gas phase . for a broad range of applications , however , the relevant phenomena occur in the presence of a liquid phase , as is often the case in processes related to electrochemistry and catalysis .",
    "the realization of liquid phase dft simulations is therefore a much pursued objective  especially when many of the standard x - ray techniques like xps or saxs are unsuited to provide atomic scale information in solution , but the inclusion of the solvent considerably increases the cost of first - principles calculations of periodic surfaces , and is therefore a rather uncommon practice.@xcite    in an explicit solvation approach , the vacuum space in the simulation box is filled with solvent molecules .",
    "the subsequent growth in the size of the system is in part responsible for the increased computational expense , but , more importantly , there is the fact that a static picture is a very poor representation of the liquid state .",
    "any solute admits a huge number of possible configurations for the solvent molecules around it , associated with multiple local minima , the net solvation effect arising from a weighted average of all these.@xcite a geometry optimization would lead to a solid or glassy phase corresponding to one of these minima in the multidimensional potential energy surface , resulting in a dielectric screening typically different from the static limit observed in the liquid state .",
    "hence , to capture the solvation effect , it is necessary to perform extensive statistical sampling involving either lengthy molecular dynamics or monte - carlo simulations .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to resort to the so called continuum ( or implicit solvent ) models , in which the solvent molecules are replaced by a dielectric medium surrounding the solute and exhibiting the static screening of the solution.@xcite in this way , the polarization induced by the solvent is introduced in an averaged fashion , and the cost of the computation gets closer to the corresponding cost in vacuum by drastically reducing the number of degrees of freedom . on the other hand ,",
    "the representation of the solvent structure is omitted , disregarding any possible solute - solvent specific interactions . still , to overcome this problem ,",
    "all or part of the first solvation shells can be included explicitly , with the dielectric medium extending beyond the limits of this cluster comprising the solute plus a few solvent molecules . in any case",
    ", the continuum model has a long tradition in quantum chemistry and has proved reliable and efficient to extract properties in solution of a large variety of molecular systems.@xcite@xmath1@xcite    in recent years a small number of implementations of the continuum model has been proposed in the context of density functional theory , plane - waves basis sets , and the car - parrinello method.@xcite@xmath1@xcite to the best of our knowledge , none of them have been employed in molecular dynamics simulations of periodic surfaces.@xcite here we revise the electrostatic continuum model of fattebert and gygi,@xcite proposing a new definition for the dielectric function to make the model suitable for the treatment of periodic slabs .",
    "the original formulation , in which the permittivity of the solvent is determined by the charge density of the solute , has proved successful in the simulation of molecular and ionic solutes,@xcite and of extended systems like polymers , with periodicity in one dimension.@xcite in the case of solid surfaces , however , the convergence to the electronic ground state turns out to be impaired . in the sections that follow ,",
    "we attribute this failure to a term in the kohn - sham potential originating in the dependence of the dielectric constant on the electronic density , and , to circumvent this issue , we redefine the permittivity as a function of the atomic positions .",
    "in this way the smooth electronic convergence is restored , along with a good conservation of the total energy in the molecular dynamics runs . the electrostatic problem in the presence of the dielectric medium",
    "is efficiently addressed with a multigrid method,@xcite@xmath1@xcite which solves the poisson equation in real space .",
    "moreover , a significant increase in efficiency can be obtained if the simulation box is partitioned in two , solving the poisson problem separately for the `` dry '' region using fast fourier transforms , while restricting the multigrid treatment to the solvated or `` wet '' part of the supercell ( and then combining both solutions in a self - consistent fashion ) . using this scheme it is possible to carry out car - parrinello molecular dynamics simulations of solid - liquid interfaces at a computational cost exceeding by just a small factor the one corresponding to vacuum .",
    "we employ this approach to investigate the proton exchange at the anatase - water interface , which is a key process in the acid - base equilibrium of tio@xmath0 surfaces .",
    "the ubiquity of titania in solid - liquid applications has incited the emergence of empirical models to assess the protonation and the dissociation of terminal groups on the tio@xmath0 surface in aqueous environments.@xcite these simple models have been broadly used among experimentalists for the interpretation of their data , but a molecular level description that accounts for the effect of structure has not been established . in this context , the present simulations intend to provide a first - principles glance of the microscopic mechanisms governing the chemistry of this interface .",
    "this model has been implemented in the public domain car - parrinello parallel code included in the quantum - espresso package,@xcite based on density - functional theory ( dft ) , periodic - boundary conditions , plane - waves basis sets , and pseudopotentials to represent the ion - electron interactions .",
    "all calculations reported in this work , unless otherwise noted , have been performed using the pw91 exchange - correlation functional@xcite in combination with vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials.@xcite the kohn - sham orbitals and charge density were expanded in plane waves up to a kinetic energy cutoff of 25 and 200 ry respectively .",
    "periodic slabs of four layers width representing the ( 101 ) surface of the anatase structure were computed using gamma - point sampling in supercells of size 10.24 @xmath2 x 7.56 @xmath2 x 17.82 @xmath2 . for finite temperature (",
    "not damped ) car - parrinello molecular dynamics simulations , an electronic mass of 400 a.u . and a time step of 0.17 fs were adopted . during geometry relaxations and dynamics ,",
    "all atoms were allowed to move , with the exception of those belonging to the two inner layers , which were fixed in their bulk positions .      within the continuum approach ,",
    "the solvent is represented as a dielectric medium surrounding a quantum - mechanical solute confined in a cavity . in particular",
    ", we consider the polarizable continuum model , in which the dielectric medium and the electronic density respond to the field of each other in a self - consistent fashion .",
    "this interaction provides the electrostatic part of the solvation free energy , @xmath3 , which is the dominant contribution for polar and charged solutes .",
    "the cavitation energy @xmath4 is defined as the work involved in creating the appropriate cavity inside the solution in the absence of solute - solvent interactions.@xcite electrostatic , cavitation , and dispersion - repulsion effects are modeled as separate contributions,@xcite and the free energy of solvation is regarded as the sum of these three terms ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "thermal and pressure dependent terms can also be included but are usually negligible .",
    "we note that this decomposition is inherent to the model , being @xmath6 the only measurable quantity .",
    "the starting point for this work is the implementation reported in reference  @xcite : in the following paragraphs we revisit those aspects of the preceding version that are essential to the present development .",
    "first , we note @xmath3 and @xmath4 are considered explicitly , while @xmath7 , less relevant for solutes of moderate size , is largely seized as part of the electrostatic term by virtue of the parametrization . the electrostatic interaction between the dielectric and the solute",
    "is calculated as proposed by fattebert and gygi,@xcite who define the permittivity @xmath8 of the solvent as a function of the electronic density @xmath9 . within a pseudopotential framework and in periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the kohn - sham energy functional@xcite can be written as @xmath10 = t[\\rho]+ e_{xc}[\\rho ] + \\frac{1}{2 } \\int \\phi({\\bf r } ) \\rho_{tot}({\\bf r})d{\\bf r}\\ ] ] @xmath11\\ ] ] where @xmath12 $ ] corresponds to the kinetic energy of the electrons and @xmath13 $ ] to the exchange - correlation energy .",
    "the last four terms on the right hand side account for the total electrostatic energy in a periodic crystal , gathering all coulombic interactions involving electrons and nuclei , only omitting for simplicity the non - local part of the pseudopotential ( for a detailed derivation see reference  @xcite or the appendix of reference  @xcite ) .",
    "the electrostatic formulation in eq . ( 1 ) arises from the ewald sum of point charges , which requires to introduce the ionic densities @xmath14 consisting of gaussian distributions of negative sign that integrate to @xmath15 , the total charge of the pseudo - ion : @xmath16 with @xmath17 the width of the gaussian associated with the site @xmath18 .    the third term on the right",

    "@xmath29 @xmath30 we provide the derivation of eq .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) in the appendix a , since it is not given in any of the previous references .",
    "the dielectric medium and the electronic density respond self - consistently to each other through the dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath9 and vice versa .    in quantum chemistry continuum models as pcm,@xcite the dielectric constant @xmath8 is taken to be 1 inside the cavity , and a fixed value outside . for molecular dynamics applications ,",
    "such a discontinuity needs to be removed to calculate accurately the analytic derivatives of the potential with respect to the ionic positions .",
    "besides , in the particular case of plane - waves implementations based on real space grids , a smoothly varying dielectric function is more appropriate for numerical reasons .",
    "fattebert and gygi proposed the following smoothed step function for the dielectric : @xmath31 this function asymptotically approaches @xmath32 ( the permittivity of the bulk solvent ) in regions of space where the electron density is low , and 1 in those regions where it is high ( outside the solvation cavity ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 is the density threshold determining the cavity size , whereas @xmath34 modulates the smoothness of the transition from @xmath32 to 1 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the cavitation energy is computed separately as the product between the surface tension of the solvent and the area of the cavity . in this implementation",
    "this term remains unchanged ; details about the calculation of @xmath4 can be found in reference  @xcite .      when the scheme described above is applied on structures extended in two dimensions , it typically fails to achieve self - consistency .",
    "we found the electrons heat up during the car - parrinello relaxation of the wavefunction , causing the total energy to diverge , as shown in fig .",
    "[ kinetice ] .",
    "in other cases the kinetic energy of the electrons is observed to decrease at the beginning , but thereafter experiences irregular oscillations without ever reaching zero . even if convergence is enforced through the use of a stringent algorithmic strategy ,",
    "the solution obtained is not reliable , e.g. , it depends on the starting conditions or the damping parameters .",
    "the source of this erratic behavior can be tracked to the inclusion of the term @xmath35 in the kohn - sham potential .",
    "this term , defined in eq .",
    "( 6 ) , arises from the dependence of the permittivity on the electron density .",
    "[ kinetice ] illustrates the impact of this contribution on the convergence of a car - parrinello electronic relaxation , by showing that an acceptable dynamics is recovered if @xmath35 is neglected.@xcite in particular , these results correspond to the anatase - water structure described in section iii , but the convergence of other systems is degraded in a similar way .",
    "the reason for the instability associated with @xmath35 can be somehow appreciated in the two dimensional plot of fig .",
    "[ vepsilon2d ] , which displays the variation of @xmath35 in the @xmath36-direction ( the one perpendicular to the surface ) at fixed @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "these coordinates have been chosen in coincide with the position of a ti atom of the surface .",
    "the same graph shows the total kohn - sham potential , excluding @xmath35 , so that the relative contribution of this term can be clearly seen .",
    "the values are exceptionally large at the solid - liquid boundary , even larger than any of the other contributions to the effective potential . referenced on the right axis ,",
    "the dielectric function @xmath24 $ ] is also shown . since @xmath35 depends on @xmath39 ( eq .",
    "6 ) , the peaks occur at the region where the charge density decays abruptly , producing a rapid variation in @xmath24 $ ] from the value in the solid to the value in the solvent . adopting the model function of eq .",
    "( 7 ) we have @xmath40 this expression goes to zero when @xmath41 or @xmath42 , and is dominated by @xmath43 otherwise.@xcite then , the extreme values of @xmath35 at the solid - liquid interface ultimately originate in the magnitude of the density threshold @xmath33 .",
    "unfortunately , this parameter may not be freely tuned , but is set in combination with @xmath34 to fit the experimental data , and no reasonable choice of ( @xmath44 ) can be made as to prevent the blowup of @xmath35 .",
    "alternative model functions to represent the dielectric were considered , e.g. , with @xmath24 $ ] exhibiting a gaussian or trigonometric decay with @xmath9 .",
    "none of these functions entailed any significant improvement , as far as all of them have in common a sudden change associated with the transition from 1 to @xmath32 , which redounds in large values of @xmath39 at the interface .",
    "the transition can be smoothed enough as to avoid the sharp peaks in @xmath35 , but in doing so the solvation effect is ruined . clearly , the discussed behavior is a consequence of the dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath9 , irrespective of the kind of function chosen to model the dielectric .",
    "it should be noticed that the inclusion of @xmath35 does not appear to disturb the convergence or the energy conservation in the case of finite systems , neither in the case of polymers ( extended in one dimension).@xcite it is seemingly because of the bi - dimensional symmetry of periodic surfaces that @xmath35 turns out to spoil the car - parrinello dynamics , by propagating the observed perturbation of the kohn - sham potential throughout a full , extended plane .",
    "it is fair to wonder about the physical meaning of this strong perturbation of the potential contained in @xmath35 . in the absence of a dielectric , or for a dielectric",
    "defined independently of the charge density , the functional derivative of @xmath45 with respect to @xmath9 turns out to be equal to the electrostatic potential @xmath22 $ ] ( see reference @xcite ) .",
    "the additional term @xmath35 emerges from the dependence of @xmath45 on @xmath8 , whenever @xmath8 is modeled as a function of the charge density . since @xmath46 ( in eq .",
    "( 8) , @xmath47 ) , @xmath35 is of a repulsive character .",
    "the choice of @xmath9 to delimitate the region filled by the continuum induces a response of the potential to counteract the strong discontinuity imposed by the same @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath35 is such a response , which , throughout the self - consistent procedure , opposes the perturbative drift enforced by the model .",
    "thus , the instability of the model emanates from the use of the self - consistent charge density to define the dielectric . a possible alternative would be to use instead a non - self consistent , or `` fake '' density , since the role of the charge density in this context is simply to shape the dielectric medium . as will be discussed below",
    ", such an option can be equivalent to define @xmath8 as a function of the atomic coordinates , which is the usual strategy in quantum chemistry methods .",
    "the idea of a dielectric determined by the atomic positions may be less attractive from a physical viewpoint : the size and shape of the cavity depend on the identity of the atoms only , and is not modulated by the electronic structure or the environment ; the polarization of the solvent is lost , and , on top of these , many more parameters are needed  at least one per atom . in practice , however , it is possible to choose a dielectric function based on the molecular coordinates that closely reproduces the @xmath9-dependent solvation , because the effect of the self - consistency and the polarization of the solvent on @xmath6 is quite minor .    in this way",
    ", we keep the expression for @xmath8 given in eq .",
    "( 7 ) , but feed it with a dummy density @xmath48 determined by the ionic positions @xmath49 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the van der waals radius for the corresponding species .",
    "hence the dielectric function takes the following form : @xmath52    using this definition , the transition of @xmath53 between 1 and @xmath32 is centered around the van der waals radius . aside from @xmath51 , which values are tabulated , @xmath34 is left as the only adjustable parameter to fit the experimental solvation energies .",
    "[ gamma ] shows the aspect of the dielectric function around an oxygen atom for different @xmath34 .",
    "this parameter must be large enough to ensure most of the transition occurs within a small length window , but at the same time the numerical accuracy needs to be preserved , so there is an upper bound for @xmath34 which depends on the given grid size .    within this framework , the electrostatic contribution to @xmath28 $ ] is simply the electrostatic potential @xmath22 $ ] , and the stability of car - parrinello dynamics in periodic slabs is recovered .",
    "table i presents , for several neutral and charged solutes , a comparison between the values of @xmath6 obtained with the dielectric functions of eq .",
    "( 7 ) and eq .",
    "( 10 ) , respectively .",
    "the small differences proceed exclusively from @xmath3 , since @xmath4 is the same in both cases ( @xmath54 ) . as mentioned above , with a proper choice of @xmath34 the position dependent dielectric is able to provide solvation energies in close agreement with the previous model and with experiments .",
    "the results shown correspond to @xmath55 .",
    "the explicit dependence of @xmath8 on the ionic positions involves a new contribution to the forces arising from the derivative of @xmath45 with respect to @xmath49 , which must be taken into account to perform conservative molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "after some manipulation involving the use of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , this derivative can be expressed as follows ( the full derivation is given in appendix b ) : @xmath56 the computation of the first term on the right is straightforward since we know , from eqs .",

    "if @xmath62 is transformed to fourier space so that @xmath63 ( see next section ) , the second term in eq . ( 11 ) can be evaluated as @xmath64 with @xmath65 the form factor of the ionic densities , @xmath66 .    to ensure the conservation of the total energy during the molecular dynamics simulations , the contributions given in eqs .",
    "( 12 ) and ( 13 ) must take the place of the derivative of the hartree energy in the absence of the dielectric : @xmath67      in standard plane waves codes based on real space grids , the electrostatic potential @xmath68 is obtained from the poisson equation ( 2 ) , which can be efficiently inverted with the use of fast fourier transforms ( fft ) .",
    "both the total charge density @xmath69 and @xmath68 can be expanded in plane waves , @xmath70 replacing into the poisson equation @xmath71 , and equating coefficients : @xmath72 unfortunately , the poisson equation in the presence of an arbitrary dielectric , eq .",
    "( 3 ) , can not be addressed in the same way , and an alternative numerical scheme is required . to that end , we have implemented from scratch a sixth - order multigrid code,@xcite which solves in real space the poisson equation with non - constant coefficients and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "( 3 ) can be rewritten as : @xmath73 this equation is developed in finite differences , expanding the derivatives of @xmath74 and @xmath8 to sixth - order according to the following relations for the gradient and the laplacian : @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath58 is a generic coordinate @xmath59 or @xmath36 ; @xmath77 is the grid spacing in the direction @xmath58 ; and @xmath78 is the discretization of a continuous function @xmath79 , representing @xmath62 , @xmath80 , or @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath82 refers to @xmath78 evaluated at a mesh point associated with @xmath83 , while @xmath84 corresponds to a neighboring point @xmath85 positions to the right in the direction @xmath58 ( if @xmath86 is located to the left of @xmath82 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath87 and @xmath88 are given by : @xmath89 @xmath90 in the case of @xmath91 for all @xmath83 , this method provides a solution for @xmath62 which is indistinguishable from the one obtained with fft .",
    "it also demonstrated an excellent performance when tried on functions with non - constant coefficients and oscillation frequencies comparable to those of interest .",
    "for example , for @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) the relative error in @xmath62 was less than 10@xmath95 in a mesh of 80@xmath9680@xmath9680 points .    at the initial steps of a molecular dynamics simulation",
    ", the convergence of the potential may require 15 - 30 multigrid cycles .",
    "given the self - consistent nature of the procedure , however , after a few time steps the number of cycles necessary to reach convergence is typically decreased to less than five .",
    "even so , the multigrid algorithm is still significantly more expensive than ffts .",
    "propitiously , multigrid methods can be adapted to any kind of boundary conditions , and this feature can be exploited to reduce the size of the mesh involved .",
    "to implement this idea , a region in the supercell  preferably the slab  must remain inaccessible to the solvent , so that @xmath91 within it . in practice , the dielectric function of eqs .",
    "( 7 ) or ( 10 ) is not diffuse enough as to encompass all the volume of the slab  if it were , the solvation effect would fade at the molecular boundaries , so the solvent occupies the interstitial space left by the atomic structure ( fig .  [ 3ddiel]a ) .",
    "this is inconvenient not only because it increases the numerical complexity of the problem , but also because it is not physical , i.e. , the solvent does not penetrate the atomic structure of the surface .",
    "a simple device to exclude the solvent from the solid interspaces is to modify @xmath48 in the following way : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the @xmath36-component of @xmath49 ( we recall @xmath36 is the coordinate perpendicular to the surface ; it is zero at the bottom of the unit cell and maximum at the top ) .",
    "the factor @xmath99 produces a rapid increase in @xmath48 underneath the atom @xmath18 , which saturates the value of @xmath81 for all atoms @xmath18 located below @xmath100 .",
    "thus , only the upper face of the slab is in contact with the solution , the dielectric function becoming equal to 1 throughout the lower section of the supercell .",
    "[ 3ddiel]b depicts @xmath81 when @xmath100 is chosen equal to the @xmath36 coordinate of an ion belonging to the second layer .    under these conditions , it is possible to solve the poisson problem in two steps : first , the potential @xmath62 is computed for @xmath101 in the full domain @xmath102 using ffts ; secondly , @xmath62 is recalculated in the presence of the dielectric with the multigrid method but in a smaller domain @xmath103 , imposing the boundary conditions proceeding from the fft solution .",
    "the sub - domain @xmath103 must be chosen in such a way that it overlaps with a sub - space where @xmath91 , so that the boundary conditions for the multigrid are given by the solution of the poisson equation in vacuum .",

    "the full procedure is summarized in scheme 1 .",
    "scheme 1    in proposing this approach , we assume the dielectric effect is mostly local and does not perturb the electrostatic potential deep inside the slab . more formally , this implies that even in the presence of the dielectric medium , there is a region in the real space grid where the self - consistent potential is exactly the same as the potential corresponding to vacuum .",
    "it is therefore important that @xmath103 extends sufficiently down into the surface as to reach that region . with this mixed scheme",

    "such a response can be avoided with a dielectric based on a non self - consistent charge , preserving in this way the potential and allowing for conservative molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "this approach is equivalent to have a position - dependent permittivity , and therefore a new term in the ionic forces must be considered .",
    "the methodology presented here is a powerful instrument to explore the thermodynamics and the reactivity of surfaces and nanoparticles in solution .",
    "replacement of the solvent molecules by a dielectric continuum may neglect the structural features of the liquid phase , but it does capture the essential polarization effect of the medium . this is manifest , for instance , in the charge of the hydroxyl group : if an additional electron is added to a neutral system consisting of a slab plus a ( distant ) oh moiety in vacuum , a significant portion of the charge flows to the solid phase .",
    "noticeably , in the presence of the solvent , the excess electron spontaneously localizes on the hydroxyl .",
    "this is quantitatively depicted in fig .",
    "[ integratedzcharge ] .    a compelling application for this continuum solvent scheme , as well as a natural continuation of this work , would be the characterization of the adsorption energies and geometries of water and other species on the different surfaces of titanium dioxide .",
    "we deem especially worthwhile the calculation of the reaction energies for the kind of equilibria mentioned above , e.g. , ti - oh@xmath0 + oh@xmath113 ti - oh@xmath1 + h@xmath0o , as a function of the surface structure .",
    "work in this direction is now in progress . at this point",
    "it should be noted that it would be not feasible to have an estimate of these quantities without the solvation model : in the absence of the dielectric , the interaction between the surface and the oh@xmath1 ion ( or between the charged slab and the water molecule ) is extremely dependent on the distance separating them , and therefore it is not possible to establish unequivocally the energies for reactants and products .",
    "when the dielectric is included , the long range interaction between charged and polar fragments is efficiently screened , and the total energy of the system becomes independent of the position of the molecule ( or the ion ) with respect to the slab .",
    "this property makes possible to evaluate reaction energies on periodic surfaces in solution which could not be calculated by other means , except perhaps with extensive molecular dynamics simulations . aside from these",
    ", the scheme presented here would be particularly useful to assess the role of the solvent in a great diversity of problems in surface chemistry , including the effects on structure , on vibrational frequencies , or on charge transfer phenomena , among many others .",
    "we feel indebted to jean - luc fattebert , oswaldo dieguez , ismailia dabo , nicola marzari , and patu groisman , for precious advice and enlightening discussions . this study has been financially supported by conicet ( pip-5220 ) and by the agencia nacional de promocin cientfica y tecnolgica ( pict 06 - 33581 ) .",
