    "four decades after the first pioneering neutrino radiation - hydrodynamic calculations of stellar collapse ( @xcite ) , the details of the core - collapse supernova explosion mechanism remain obscure",
    ". however , certain essentials are clear .",
    "the collapse of the evolved stellar core to a protoneutron star ( pns ) and its evolution to a compact cold neutron star provides a gigantic reservoir of gravitational energy , @xmath23@xmath310@xmath4  erg , a mass - energy equivalent of @xmath20.17  @xmath5 .",
    "any core - collapse supernova mechanism must tap this energy and convert the fraction needed to match type - ii supernova observations ( @xmath210@xmath6  erg @xmath7 1 bethe [ b ] ) into kinetic and internal energy of the exploding stellar envelope .",
    "there is general agreement that the prompt hydrodynamic explosion mechanism does not work and that the bounce shock always stalls , falling short of blowing up the star ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and must be re - energized to lead to a supernova .",
    "however , there is no agreement on the detailed mechanism that revives and endows the shock with sufficient energy to make a canonical @xmath21-bethe supernova . for decades ,",
    "the `` neutrino - driven '' mechanism , first proposed in its direct form by @xcite , and in its delayed form by @xcite and @xcite , seemed compelling .",
    "it relies on a subtle imbalance of neutrino heating and cooling that leads to a net energy deposition behind the stalled shock , sufficient to revive it and drive the explosion on a timescale of hundreds of milliseconds .",
    "while appealing , it has been shown to fail for regular massive stars in spherical symmetry ( 1d ) when the best neutrino physics and transport are used @xcite . yet , weak explosions may be obtained in 1d for the lowest mass progenitors , o - ne - mg cores ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is now almost certain that the canonical explosion mechanism must be multi - dimensional ( 2d/3d ) in nature .",
    "the multi - d dynamics associated with convective overturn in the postshock region ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the recently identified standing accretion shock instability ( sasi , e.g. , @xcite ) lead to a dwell time of accreting outer core material in the postshock region that is larger on average than in the 1d case .",
    "this results in a greater neutrino energy deposition efficiency behind the shock and , thus , creates more favorable conditions for explosion @xcite .",
    "the first generation of multi - dimensional supernova calculations , still employing gray flux - limited diffusion ( or yet simpler schemes ) for neutrino transport , indeed found that neutrino - driven convective overturn in the region between the stalled shock and the pns sufficiently increased the neutrino energy deposition rate to lead to a delayed explosion ( @xcite ) .",
    "the more sophisticated studies that followed changed this picture .",
    "recent long - term axisymmetric ( 2d ) supernova calculations with multi - group , multi - species neutrino physics and transport find it difficult to explode garden - variety massive stars via the neutrino mechanism .",
    "@xcite report explosion only for the low - mass ( 11.2  @xmath5 ) progenitor of @xcite , while @xcite report the onset of explosion in a 15-@xmath5 model of @xcite , given moderately fast rotation and the use of the lattimer - swesty equation of state ( eos ; @xcite ) with a nuclear compressibility modulus @xmath8 of 180  mev , which is significantly softer than the current best experimental values ( @xmath9  mev ; @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite obtain explosions for 11-@xmath5 and 15-@xmath5 progenitors from @xcite only when they take silicon and oxygen burning into account and due to a synergy between nuclear burning , the sasi , and neutrino heating .",
    "@xcite do not obtain neutrino - driven explosions ( except in the case of o - ne - mg cores and accretion - induced collapse ; @xcite ) , but observe the excitation of pns core @xmath10-modes . in their calculations ,",
    "the pns core oscillations reach non - linear amplitudes and damp via the emission of strong sound waves that propagate through the postshock region and efficiently deposit energy into the shock , eventually leading to late explosions at @xmath21  second after bounce . this _",
    "acoustic _ mechanism appears to be robust enough to blow up even the most massive and extended progenitors @xcite , but remains controversial and needs to be confirmed by other groups ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the context of rapid progenitor rotation , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( the latter for the accretion - induced collapse scenario )",
    "have shown that energetic mhd - driven explosions may be obtained if field - amplification by the magneto - rotational instability @xcite is as efficient in the core - collapse context as suggested @xcite .",
    "whether rotation alone and without strong magnetic fields favors or disfavors a neutrino - driven explosion remains to be seen @xcite , but rapid rotation has been shown to damp convection @xcite and weaken the sasi @xcite .",
    "neutrinos , their creation , propagation , and interactions with supernova matter , are of paramount importance to the core - collapse supernova problem .",
    "they carry away @xmath299% of the final neutron star s gravitational binding energy and @xmath21% of this energy would be sufficient to blow up the star . depending on progenitor characteristics that set the postbounce rate of mass accretion onto the pns ,",
    "a successful supernova explosion should occur within @xmath211.5  s after bounce to match observational and theoretical neutron star upper mass limits around @xmath222.5  @xmath5 ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "consequently , the explosion mechanism must deliver canonical 1-b explosions on this timescale and , if the explosion is neutrino - driven , the neutrino heating efficiency and @xmath11 neutrinos and their anti - particles do not contribute much to the heating .",
    "] must be on the order of 10% to yield an explosion that achieves an energy of 1  b within @xmath21  s.    the neutrinos travelling through the postshock region in a postbounce supernova core are not in thermal equilibrium with the baryonic matter .",
    "they should ideally be treated with full kinetic theory , describing the neutrino distributions and their temporal distribution with the boltzmann equation ( @xcite ) .",
    "boltzmann transport is in its most general form a 7-dimensional problem .",
    "the 6d neutrino phase space ( usually split up into 3d spatial coordinates , neutrino energy , and 2 angular degrees of freedom ) and time .",
    "in addition , there are up to 6 neutrino types ( 3 particle species , and their anti - particles ) to deal with .",
    "spherically - symmetric boltzmann transport schemes have been devised and implemented in the core - collapse context @xcite , but general boltzmann transport in multiple spatial dimensions is computationally challenging and will remain so in the intermediate term .",
    "hence , approximations must be made in devising computationally tractable neutrino transport schemes for multi - d simulations .",
    "a highly sophisticated approximation that arguably comes close to full boltzmann transport in the case of quasi - spherical configurations in 2d is that presented in @xcite , and based on earlier work by @xcite .",
    "these authors solve equations for the zeroth and first angular moments of spherically - symmetric radiation fields along multiple radial rays ( ray - by - ray approach ; @xcite ) and perform a variable eddington factor closure @xcite via a single spherically symmetric boltzmann solution on an averaged 1d profile of the 2d hydrodynamics data .",
    "neighboring rays are coupled to provide for limited treatment of latitudinal transport .",
    "their multi - group ( multi - energy and multi - neutrino species ) scheme includes inelastic neutrino - electron scattering , aberration , gravitational redshift , and frame effects to @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite implemented a genuinely 2d direct solution of a reduced boltzmann equation via the method of discrete ordinates ( s@xmath13 : see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) in the code vulcan/2d , neglecting energy redistribution and fluid - velocity dependence .    a common , more approximate way to handle neutrino transport that has a long pedigree in 1d core - collapse studies is multi - group ( energy / neutrino species ) non - equilibrium flux - limited diffusion ( mgfld ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "fld schemes solve a diffusion equation for the mean radiation intensity , the zeroth angular moment of the specific radiation intensity .",
    "hence , they drop all local angular dependence of the radiation field , while , in the mgfld case , retaining the spectral neutrino distribution .",
    "mgfld accurately describes the radiation field at high optical depth where the diffusion approximation is exact . in the free - streaming limit",
    ", the flux must be limited to maintain causality and an interpolation must be performed between diffusion and free - streaming regimes by an ad - hoc prescription ( using a flux limiter ) .",
    "2d fld schemes were pioneered in the core - collapse context by @xcite and modern mgfld implementations can be found in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "it is not a priori clear whether mgfld is an accurate enough prescription to yield postbounce supernova dynamics in qualitative and quantitative agreement with a more accurate multi - angle treatment . since net energy deposition by neutrinos",
    "is favored only in the semi - transparent gain layer , the quality of a mgfld scheme may sensitively depend on the flux limiter chosen @xcite .",
    "the fact that 2d gray fld schemes have in the past led to neutrino - driven explosions @xcite , while mgfld schemes appear not to @xcite , emphasizes the importance of a spectral treatment of neutrino transport .    in 1d ,",
    "mgfld and boltzmann neutrino transport were compared on static hydrodynamic postbounce backgrounds by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . also in 1d ,",
    "@xcite compared boltzmann transport and mgfld evolutions in the collapse phase , while @xcite performed the only comparison to date of 1d long - term boltzmann and mgfld supernova evolutions .",
    "the static studies all agree that boltzmann transport yields larger instantaneous neutrino heating rates in the gain region , mostly because of a more slowly decreasing inverse flux factor ( @xmath14 over the ratio of flux to neutrino energy density ) , a quantity that can be related to the rate of energy absorption . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite find no significant dynamical differences between mgfld and boltzmann transport evolutions in their long - term comparison study with the 13-@xmath5 progenitor model of  @xcite .    in this paper , we present 2d _ multi - angle _ , multi - group neutrino transport supernova calculations using the newtonian axisymmetric vulcan/2d code @xcite . comparing multi - d boltzmann and mgfld treatments ,",
    "we perform postbounce simulations with vulcan/2d and compare 2d steady - state snapshots , as well as fully - coupled dynamical 2d radiation - hydrodynamics evolutions , for non- and rapidly - rotating 20-@xmath5 models whose precollapse profiles are taken from @xcite .",

    "we then discuss time - dependent calculations , the dynamical differences between boltzmann transport and mgfld runs , and the consequences for postbounce supernova model evolution .",
    "we wrap up in  [ section : summary ] with a summary and critical discussion of the work presented in this paper .",
    "we employ the arbitrary lagrangian - eulerian ( ale , with second - order total - variation - diminishing [ tvd ] remap ) radiation - hydrodynamics code vulcan/2d .",
    "the hydrodynamics module was first described by @xcite .",
    "the 2d time - explicit hydrodynamics scheme is second - order accurate ( in smooth parts of the flow ) , unsplit , and implements a finite - difference representation of the newtonian euler equations with artificial viscosity on arbitrarily structured grids and in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the computational grid employed here is set up to resemble a spherical - polar grid at radii greater than 20  km and gradually transitions to a cartesian structure at smaller radii @xcite .",
    "this ( a ) avoids hydrodynamic timestep restrictions due to focussing of angular grid lines and ( b ) liberates the pns core , thus allowing mass motion along the axis of symmetry .",
    "self - gravity is implemented via direct grid - based solution of the newtonian poisson equation , as described in @xcite , and we employ the finite - temperature nuclear equation of state of @xcite .",
    "the calculations are run with 230 logarithmically - spaced radial and 120 angular zones ( including the inner , quasi - cartesian region ) .",

    "the observed local differences in neutrino energy deposition between @xmath0  and mgfld are due primarily to the vastly different degree to which the two schemes capture the global pole - equator asymmetry of the radiation field in the rapidly - rotating postbounce supernova core of model s20.@xmath44 . @xmath0  yields much larger fluxes in the polar direction than mgfld , but predicts lower neutrino fluxes in equatorial regions  ( cf .",

    "[ fig : s20pi_netgain2 ] clearly shows the rotation - induced enhancement of the energy deposition ( per unit volume ) near the equator and the larger gain rate per unit volume predicted by mgfld at small to intermediate radii .",
    "the second factor is the simple fact that the volume of the equatorial gain regions is much larger than that of the polar gain regions .    as we shall discuss in the following section , the large local differences in neutrino heating between the @xmath0  and mgfld snapshots have a dynamical consequence for the rapidly rotating model and lead to a significant polar expansion of the shock in the @xmath0  postbounce evolution calculation",
    "in order to study differences between @xmath0  and mgfld in a time - dependent postbounce setting , we follow our relaxed 160-ms @xmath0  models in fully coupled radiation - hydrodynamics fashion for @xmath2340  ms ( model s20.nr ) and 390  ms ( model s20.@xmath44 ) of postbounce time . in parallel with the @xmath0  runs , we continue their mgfld counterparts for the same time span .",
    "since we begin the mgfld and @xmath0  calculations from an identical hydrodynamic configuration at 160  ms after bounce , any qualitative or quantitative differences in their evolutions must ultimately be due to differences in the neutrino heating and cooling between @xmath0  and mgfld .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : s20_gain ] , we display the time evolution of the integral neutrino energy deposition ( net gain ) in the gain region of model s20.nr .",
    "the net gain systematically declines at early postbounce times , due ( a ) to the declining neutrino luminosity and ( b ) to the rapid settling of accreting material into the net loss region near the pns core ( cf .",
    "fig .  7 of @xcite ) . at later times ,",
    "sasi - modulated convection increases the dwell time of accreting outer core material in the gain layer and the slope of the net gain evolution flattens .",

    "other factors that contribute to the increased heating in the @xmath0  calculation are the higher rms neutrino energies ( by @xmath25% ; shown in the right panel of fig .",

    "the polar , equatorial , and angle - averaged shock positions portrayed by fig .  [ fig : shockrad ] show that the hydrodynamics responds immediately to the increased polar heating in the @xmath0  calculation by a pronounced expansion of the shock along the poles .",

    "all this results in a neutrino energy deposition rate per unit mass in polar regions that is locally up to @xmath22.53 times higher when multi - angle transport is used .",
    "this increased polar neutrino heating has a dynamical effect on the postbounce evolution , leading to rapid shock expansion in the polar regions and an earlier onset of the ( initially ) rotationally - weakened sasi .",

    "<S> we perform axisymmetric ( 2d ) multi - angle , multi - group neutrino radiation - hydrodynamic calculations of the postbounce phase of core - collapse supernovae using a genuinely 2d discrete - ordinate ( @xmath0 ) method . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the long - term postbounce evolution of the cores of one nonrotating and one rapidly - rotating 20-m@xmath1 stellar model for @xmath2400 milliseconds from 160  ms to @xmath2550  ms after bounce . </S>",
    "<S> we present a multi - d analysis of the multi - angle neutrino radiation fields and compare in detail with counterpart simulations carried out in the 2d multi - group flux - limited diffusion ( mgfld ) approximation to neutrino transport . </S>",
    "<S> we find that 2d multi - angle transport is superior in capturing the global and local radiation - field variations associated with rotation - induced and sasi - induced aspherical hydrodynamic configurations . in the rotating model , </S>",
    "<S> multi - angle transport predicts much larger asymptotic neutrino flux asymmetries with pole to equator ratios of up to @xmath22.5 , while mgfld tends to sphericize the radiation fields already in the optically semi - transparent postshock regions . along the poles , </S>",
    "<S> the multi - angle calculation predicts a dramatic enhancement of the neutrino heating by up to a factor of 3 , which alters the postbounce evolution and results in greater polar shock radii and an earlier onset of the initially rotationally weakened sasi . in the nonrotating model , </S>",
    "<S> differences between multi - angle and mgfld calculations remain small at early times when the postshock region does not depart significantly from spherical symmetry . at later times </S>",
    "<S> , however , the growing sasi leads to large - scale asymmetries and the multi - angle calculation predicts up to 30% higher average integral neutrino energy deposition rates than mgfld . </S>"
