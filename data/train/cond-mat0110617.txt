    "colloidal suspensions of monodisperse spherical particles , with a diameter between 1 nm and 1 @xmath0 m , in liquids or gases self assemble onto three - dimensional simple lattices whose lattice parameter can be easily tailored , providing new opportunities for fundamental as well as for applied research ( see , e.g. , ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "the optical properties of these colloidal crystals are being investigated by many research groups because they seem to be good photonic band - gap materials ; but they have interesting acoustic properties as well .",
    "@xcite moreover , experiments relating to the reflection , transmission and absorption of ultrasonic waves by colloidal crystals can be very useful for the characterization of such systems , provided the means exist for a proper theoretical analysis of the experimental data .",
    "finally , theoretical results for colloidal crystals offer a starting point for the understanding , at a semiquantitative level , of the propagation of acoustic waves in corresponding random media consisting of monodispersed spherical particles in a fluid .  @xcite        the vibration modes ( normal modes of the elastic field ) of a phononic crystal , by which we mean a composite material whose density @xmath1 and lam coefficients @xmath2 and @xmath3 vary periodically in space , are bloch waves with a corresponding frequency band structure which is analogous to that of electrons in ordinary crystals and electromagnetic waves in photonic crystals .",
    "@xcite with an appropriate choice of the parameters involved one may obtain phononic crystals with absolute ( omnidirectional ) frequency gaps ( phononic gaps ) in selected regions of frequency .",
    "an elastic wave , whose frequency lies within an absolute frequency gap of a phononic crystal , incident on a slab of the crystal of certain thickness will be reflected by it , the slab operating as a perfect nonabsorbing mirror of elastic waves in the frequency region of the gap .  @xcite it may be possible , for example , to construct in this way vibration - free cavities which might be very useful in high - precision mechanical systems operating in a given frequency range .    in this paper",
    "we investigate in detail the acoustic properties of fcc colloidal crystals of polystyrene spheres in water and of close - packed silica spheres in air ( opals ) . given that these systems have a characteristic length scale of the order of 1 @xmath0 m , they should exhibit interesting acoustic properties at ultrasonic frequencies of a few hundred mhz to a few ghz .",
    "it should be noted , however , that our results apply to different regions of frequency of the acoustic field provided that the size of the spheres and of the unit cell are scaled accordingly , and provided the elastic coefficients can be taken as constants independent of frequency over the said regions .",
    "the calculations of the frequency band structure and of the transmission coefficient of acoustic waves through a slab of the material were done using the layer - multiple - scattering formalism we have developed for this purpose .",
    "@xcite a formalism along the same lines has also been published by liu _",
    "et al._.  @xcite we have already demonstrated the efficiency of this method in relation to solid - solid composites .",
    "@xcite the present paper shows that the method applies equally well to phononic crystals consisting of nonoverlapping solid spheres in a fluid host ; it appears that the plane - wave method for calculating the frequency band structure of such systems has convergence problems .",
    "@xcite besides , we shall pay particular attention to the physical origin of the different modes of the acoustic field in the systems under consideration .",
    "we consider a model colloidal crystal consisting of polystyrene spheres in water . the mass density and the sound velocities for polystyrene are : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 . for water",
    "we have : @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "we begin by considering the scattering of a harmonic plane acoustic wave ( a longitudinal wave ) of angular frequency @xmath9 , by a single polystyrene sphere of radius @xmath10 in water ; the water extends over all space .",
    "the incident plane wave can be written as a sum of spherical waves associated with the spherical harmonics @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 , as usual .",

    "( b ) transmittance of an acoustic wave incident normally on a slab of the above crystal consisting of 32 planes of spheres parallel to the ( 111 ) surface .",
    "the positions of the first two resonant modes of a single polystyrene sphere in water are indicated in the margin.,height=226 ]    a spherical wave of given @xmath17 scatters independently of the others , of different ( @xmath18 ) , because of the spherical symmetry of the scatterer ; therefore the total scattering cross section is the sum of partial @xmath17 cross sections , with @xmath19 up to a maximum @xmath20 depending on the size parameter , @xmath21 , of the sphere .",
    "we assume that waves with @xmath22 do not scatter from the sphere and do not contribute to the total scattering cross section .",
    "of course partial cross sections of different @xmath23 ( but of the same @xmath19 ) are equal because of the spherical symmetry of the system . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the total scattering cross section for a plane wave scattered by a polystyrene sphere in water as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "the peaks correspond to resonant modes of the acoustic field about the sphere with an angular distribution of the displacement field at the surface of the sphere determined by the spherical waves which contribute to these modes .",
    "we find that the resonance at @xmath24 is an @xmath25 resonance : the displacement field associated with it is made up almost entirely ( 98% ) from @xmath25 spherical waves ; the one at @xmath26 is an @xmath27 resonance : the corresponding displacement field is made up mostly ( 90% ) from @xmath27 spherical waves ; finally the field associated with the resonance at @xmath28 is made up mostly from @xmath29 waves ( 65% ) and @xmath30 waves ( 22% ) . and",
    "we remember that there will be ( @xmath31 ) resonant modes of the displacement field corresponding to @xmath13 of the same frequency @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath32 is ( @xmath31)-degenerate .",
    "we now consider a fcc crystal , with lattice constant @xmath33 , of nonoverlapping polystyrene spheres in water .",

    "the spheres of a plane are arranged on a hexagonal lattice of lattice constant @xmath36 , defined by the primitive vectors @xmath37 and @xmath38 , in the @xmath39 plane ( plane of the spheres ) .",
    "the ( @xmath40)th plane along the @xmath41 axis is obtained from the @xmath42th plane by a primitive translation , @xmath43 , of the crystal .",
    "the planes are separated along the @xmath41 direction by a distance @xmath44 .",
    "[ fig2](a ) shows the frequency band structure of acoustic waves in this crystal normal to the ( 111 ) surface , obtained by the method of ref .",

    ", the component of the reduced wavevector within the surface brillouin zone ( sbz ) of the fcc ( 111 ) surface , @xmath46 , equals zero .",
    "the symmetry of the bands @xmath47 is determined by the symmetry group for this direction ( the @xmath48 group ) and the corresponding propagating modes ( bloch waves ) of the acoustic field belong to the different irreducible representations of this group , denoted by @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 are one - dimensional : the corresponding frequency bands are non - degenerate , and @xmath16 is two - dimensional : the corresponding frequency bands are doubly degenerate . at the @xmath49 point",
    "( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) the modes of the acoustic field belong to the irreducible representations of the @xmath52 group associated with this point , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "we see that the frequency bands of fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) appear in pairs : @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "however , this symmetry property is not valid for an arbitrary value of @xmath46 , because the crystal under consideration , described by the @xmath52 group , does not have a plane of mirror symmetry parallel to the ( 111 ) surface which would transform @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "the above symmetry property holds only for @xmath46 on the @xmath57 axis [ @xmath58 , because a rotation through @xmath59 about the @xmath57 axis is a symmetry operation of @xmath52 and it transforms @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "the ( longitudinal ) wavefield , of given @xmath9 and @xmath62 , in the host region between the @xmath42th and the ( @xmath40)th planes of spheres , can be expanded into plane waves propagating ( or decaying ) to the left and to the right as follows    @xmath63+\\ { \\bf u}_{{\\mathbf{g}}n } ^{- } \\exp\\left[i\\,{\\mathbf{k}}_{{\\mathbf{g}}l}^{- } \\cdot ( { \\mathbf{r}}-{\\mathbf{a}}_n)\\right]\\biggr\\}\\ ; , \\label{eq : unn+1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath64^{1/2}\\right)\\ ; , \\label{eq : kg}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 are the two - dimensional reciprocal vectors corresponding to the lattice defined by @xmath66 and @xmath67 above , and @xmath68 is a point between the @xmath42th and @xmath69th planes .",
    "a generalized bloch wave satisfies the equation @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we note that , although both longitudinal and transverse modes of the elastic field are considered within the ( solid ) spheres , only longitudinal modes exist in the ( fluid ) host region in the absence of viscosity .",
    "therefore , in a binary composite of nonoverlapping solid spheres in a fluid host , where the solid component does not form a continuous network , there can not be propagating transverse waves .",
    "consequently , at the @xmath49 point ( @xmath73 @xmath51 ) the dispersion curves [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and also figs .  [ fig3 ] ,  [ fig5 ] ,  and  [ fig7](a ) below ] , show only one ( longitudinal ) branch starting from zero frequency , instead of the three ( corresponding to both longitudinal and transverse modes ) appearing in solid - solid composites .",
    "@xcite    one can easily show that when @xmath50 , the @xmath74 component of the wavefield , described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : unn+1 ] ) , vanishes ( @xmath75 ) for the modes of the @xmath15 or the @xmath16 symmetry ; only the @xmath14 symmetry allows a non - vanishing @xmath76 component of the wavefield .",
    "now assume that we have a slab of the crystal of finite thickness , i.e. @xmath77 fcc ( 111 ) planes of polystyrene spheres ; between the spheres and to the left and right of the slab , extending to infinity , we have water . there , and for the frequency range which interests us here , the acoustic wavefield has only the one component @xmath76 . and therefore the external field couples with the field inside the slab essentially only through the @xmath76 component of the latter .",
    "therefore an acoustic wave of given frequency , incident normally on the ( 111 ) slab of the crystal , will excite essentially only @xmath14 modes of the crystal .",
    "if such a band does not exist at the given frequency the wave will be totally reflected by the slab .",
    "there will be no transmitted wave .",
    "the reader will see that this is indeed the case in the present instance : we show in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , opposite the frequency band structure , the transmission coefficient of an acoustic plane wave incident normally on a slab of the crystal consisting of 32 planes of polystyrene spheres in water .",
    "the transmission coefficient opposite the @xmath14 bands exhibits the well - known fabry - perot - like oscillations due to multiple scattering between the surfaces of the slab ; elsewhere it practically vanishes , and this includes regions of frequency where only bands of the @xmath15 and/or @xmath16 symmetry exist .",
    "of course the above argument holds for normal incidence ; off this direction the symmetry argument does not apply , and there will be some transmission if there are any propagating modes of the acoustic field at the given frequency ( see below , fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .    from a practical point of view , once the frequency band structure and , if required , the transmission coefficient have been calculated , one has all that is necessary for a comparison with relevant experimental data . however , it is worthwhile to look at the physics behind the band structure of fig .",
    "we note that the five narrow bands about @xmath78 ( we remember that the @xmath16 band is doubly degenerate ) derive from the @xmath25 resonances on the individual spheres , which interact weakly between them .",
    "the five - fold degeneracy of the resonance of the single sphere is split by this interaction in accordance with the lower ( cubic ) symmetry of the crystal field .",
    "similarly the seven narrow bands about @xmath79 derive from the @xmath27 resonances on the individual spheres .",
    "we observe the small hybridization gaps opening up about @xmath80 and about @xmath79 , between bands of the same symmetry .    , for @xmath81 .",
    "( b ) transmittance of an acoustic wave incident with @xmath82 on a slab of 32 fcc ( 111 ) planes of polystyrene spheres in water.,height=188 ]    there is also a mode of propagation of acoustic waves corresponding to almost free propagation in an effective homogeneous medium . in the absence of the resonances associated with the spheres ,",
    "this mode of propagation , which has the @xmath14 symmetry , would dominate the frequency band structure of the acoustic field as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "it was calculated by suppressing the @xmath83 resonances , i.e. cutting off the @xmath83 spherical waves , which give rise to these resonances , from the spherical - wave expansion of the wavefield ( see ref .  ) . in the long - wavelength limit ( @xmath84 )",
    "we obtain a linear dispersion curve , the slope of which gives an effective velocity of sound for the composite medium , @xmath85 , which is in very good agreement with the result , @xmath86 , of the effective - medium approximation .",
    "@xcite the small gap about @xmath78 in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , is a bragg gap ; it is analogous to the small gaps one obtains at the edges of the brillouin zone in the electronic band structure of free - electron - like metals .",
    "when the resonances on the spheres are allowed in , one obtains the band structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , with apparent hybridization gaps between the continuum band [ of fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ] and resonance bands of the same symmetry ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we believe that the disorder that is naturally there in a colloidal solution , does not eradicate the essential characteristics of the acoustic modes as calculated here , which are determined by the local environment about a sphere and less so by long range order .",
    "we would expect the fine features associated with narrow bands to be smoothed out by disorder , but bands of modes separated by gaps could remain",
    ". this would be in accordance with the results of brillouin - scattering experiments on disordered colloidal suspensions of monodispersed polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ) spheres in transparent oil .",
    "it has been shown that in these colloidal suspensions different longitudinal modes of propagation of the acoustic field exist which are separated by frequency gaps about the resonance frequencies of an individual pmma sphere ,  @xcite which agrees , at a semiquantitative level , with the hybridization - induced gaps discussed above .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) we show an example of the band structure for a @xmath87 , and next to it , in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , the transmission coefficient of an acoustic wave , with the same @xmath46 , incident on a slab of the material consisting of 32 fcc ( 111 ) planes of polystyrene spheres .",
    "the thing to note is that all bands are active in this case , although the transmission coefficient is not always unity [ compare with fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] .",
    "we remember that the incident wave can not have a frequency smaller than @xmath88 .",
    "finally , it can be seen that now the frequency bands do not have the reflection symmetry found in the case of @xmath50 [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] , for the reasons given above .",
    "we calculated the frequency band structure for a sufficient number of @xmath46 points within the sbz .",
    "there is a near - omnidirectional gap about @xmath89 ; we tried to turn this gap into a proper omnidirectional gap by changing some of the parameters , but we did not succeed .     and ( b ) : @xmath90 .",
    "the solid / dotted / dashed lines refer to bands of @xmath14/@xmath15/@xmath16 symmetry , respectively .",
    "the positions of the first two resonant modes of a single polystyrene sphere in water are indicated in the margin.,height=188 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we look at the dependence of the frequency band structure on the fractional volume occupied by the spheres .",
    "we see in particular that the width of the resonance bands increases with @xmath91 , apparently because the spatial overlap of the wavefield associated with resonances on neighboring spheres increases with @xmath91 .",
    "in this section we consider a phononic crystal , an artificial opal , consisting of two media ( silica spheres in air ) with density and velocity contrasts much higher than was the case in the crystal ( polystyrene spheres in water ) studied in the preceding section .",
    "opalescent structures ( usually referred to as synthetic or artificial opals ) can be obtained from monodispersed silica colloids , e.g. by sedimentation in the gravitational field . in this way , fcc arrays of silica microspheres in air , near the close - packing density ( @xmath92 ) , similar to a natural opal , have been obtained .",
    "@xcite here we present some results on the acoustic properties of such an opal .",
    "the mass density and the sound velocities for silica are : @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "for air we have : @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "proceeding as in section  [ poly ] , we first consider the scattering of a harmonic plane acoustic wave , of angular frequency @xmath9 , by a single silica sphere of radius @xmath10 in air . in this case",
    "the total scattering cross section is a slowly increasing function of @xmath98 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .      however , the partial cross sections , corresponding to different values of @xmath19 , exhibit well defined resonance peaks , of some width , as can be seen from fig .  [ fig6 ] . at @xmath99",
    "we obtain an @xmath100 resonance , at @xmath101 an @xmath30 resonance , and at @xmath102 an @xmath25 resonance .",
    "we consider then an fcc crystal of nonoverlapping silica spheres in air with @xmath103 and view it as a sequence of ( 111 ) planes of spheres .",

    "the physical origin of the bands shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) , other than the flat band about @xmath104 , can be understood in much the same way as for the bands of fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) . in the absence of hybridization",
    "we would have , extending practically over the entire frequency range , a mode corresponding to almost free propagation in an effective homogeneous medium , with bragg gaps opening up about @xmath105 at the edges of the brillouin zone and about @xmath106 at the center of the brillouin zone ; and we would have also resonance bands developing about the @xmath100 and @xmath30 resonances of the individual spheres . from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we expect a single @xmath100 resonance band of @xmath14 symmetry about @xmath107 ; and three @xmath30 bands about @xmath108 , of which one should be non - degenerate ( @xmath14 symmetry ) and one doubly degenerate ( @xmath16 symmetry ) .",
    "we expect a degree of hybridization between bands of the same ( @xmath14 ) symmetry , and this naturally leads to the bands shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) , except for the one flat band , a doubly degenerate band of @xmath16 symmetry , about @xmath104 , which appears to have a very different physical origin ( see below ) .    in the long - wavelength limit ( @xmath84 )",
    "we obtain a linear dispersion curve , the slope of which gives an effective velocity of sound in the composite medium , @xmath109 m / s , which is in very good agreement with result , @xmath110 m / s , of the effective - medium approximation .",
    "@xcite we note that this agreement is greatly improved at lower values of the volume - filling fraction @xmath91 .",
    "it is worth noting , also , that the effective velocity of sound in a system of silica spheres in air is smaller than in air because of the high density contrast between silica and air .",
    "indeed , in the limit @xmath111 , the effective - medium approximation gives practically identical results with the simple expression @xmath112^{1/2}$ ] , which gives @xmath113 at any value of @xmath91 .    .",
