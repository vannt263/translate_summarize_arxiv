    "the inspiral and merger of a binary pair of compact objects ( holes or neutron stars ) is one of the most promising sources of signals detectable by gravitational wave observatories . for the ground - based detectors ligo@xcite , virgo@xcite , geo600@xcite and tama@xcite , binary merger , especially of intermediate - mass black holes@xcite is an exciting possibility ; for the space - based lisa detector@xcite , the detection of inspiral / merger of supermassive holes is highly probable , and is one of the primary scientific targets .",
    "the need for theoretical waveforms for the inspiral / merger has driven the effort to find a computational solution for the details of the process , but the difficulty of the task has made this problem also a measure of the usefulness of numerical computation in general relativity .",
    "the hope has been that numerical codes evolving initial data can compute the orbital motion using einstein s equations and , in the case of neutron stars , using hydrodynamical equations .",
    "these evolution codes would have , as an intrinsic feature , the loss of energy by the binary due to outgoing wave energy , and the gradual inspiral due to this loss .",
    "an important reason for the limited progress on this problem is the matter of timescales . near a black hole ,",
    "the timescale on which the gravitational field can change is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mass of the hole ; for a neutron star the timescale is several times longer .",
    "the time step in evolution codes is governed by this short timescale .",
    "( more precisely , the spatial grid near the compact objects must be smaller than @xmath2 , and to satisfy the courant condition , the time step must be no larger than @xmath3 times this grid size . ) by contrast , the timescale @xmath4 , for orbital motion at radius @xmath5 , is much larger than this , and the timescale for the interesting dynamics , the radiation - reaction driven inspiral is much greater yet .",
    "the consequence of this incompatibility of timescales is that a very large number of time steps is needed in order to see the physics of interest . and",
    "computing a large number of time steps is not yet possible .",
    "instabilities@xcite operating at the short timescale prevent the code from giving useful answers about the long timescale .",
    "the origin of the difficulty suggests its cure : an approximation method that avoids the short timescales .",
    "here we describe such a method : a solution for periodic sources and fields .",
    "we assume that the compact objects , and their fields , rotate with a constant angular velocity ( to be denoted @xmath6 below . )",
    "this approximation will fail of course , in the very latest stages of inspiral merger , when the orbit decays rapidly due to a secular instability or the dynamics of the final merger . but that last stage is , by its very nature , rapid ; its timescale is only several times that of the shortest timescale of the problem .",
    "this last stage , then , can plausibly be handled by numerical evolution codes",
    ". indeed , evolution codes , especially with perturbation theory handling the final ringdown@xcite , are already near to doing this .",
    "our goal , then , is a method that can approximate the solution up to the time that numerical evolution codes can take over the task that only they can handle .",
    "our approach is not entirely new ; it is similar in underlying motivation to a method introduced by detweiler and collaborators@xcite , but our approach is very different in its details and its implementation .",
    "it is also very closely related to the approach being used by friedman and his collaborators@xcite .",
    "periodic motion and outgoing waves are , of course , impossible in einstein s theory , both intuitively and mathematically .",
    "for this reason , we will solve for standing waves ( to be defined and discussed below ) in the gravitational field . our periodic standing - wave ( psw ) approach , then , will be to find exact ( numerical ) periodic standing - wave solutions of the einstein field equations and to use these exact solutions as approximations to the physical problem of slow inspiral with outgoing waves .",
    "the most basic ideas behind this periodic standing - wave solution have already been introduced in a previous paper@xcite , but the implementation there was applied only to two - dimensional models and was limited in other ways ; in particular , that paper did not discuss the general meaning of standing waves .",
    "an general overview of the psw project has also been given@xcite .",
    "here we present a more specific discussion , along with numerical results for three - dimensional models .",
    "this paper is meant to serve as the introduction to the psw , with subsequent papers presenting more detailed information on particular methods , and progress on solving the physical problem .",
    "a key idea in our approach is the relationship of standing waves to outgoing waves . in a linear field theory ,",
    "a definition of standing waves is that they are half the sum of an outgoing solution and ingoing solution . here , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we shall call this sum lsio for linear superposition of ( half ) ingoing and ( half ) outgoing solutions . in a linear theory ,",
    "such a superposition is itself a solution . in our nonlinear field model theories ,",
    "it will turn out that  despite strong nonlinearities  this continues to be very nearly true .",
    "this _ effective linearity _ , the approximate equality of the lsio and a true standing - wave solution , has already been demonstrated for simple two - dimensional models , and results for three dimensional nonlinear models will be presented below .",
    "more important , the basis for effective linearity appears to be robust .",
    "this basis lies in the fact that the strong nonlinearities in our model theories ( and in the physical problem ) are confined to the near - field regions around the sources . in these nonlinear near - field regions",
    "the solution is insensitive to the distant boundary conditions ; it is substantially the same for ingoing boundary conditions as for outgoing . in this near - field region",
    "then , the lsio will be very nearly a solution despite strong nonlinearities , since we are superposing nearly identical solutions . outside this strong - field near zone the model theories , and the physical theory , are nearly linear , so that again the lsio is a solution .",
    "the lsio will therefore be a good approximation to a solution everywhere .",
    "below , we shall choose our definitions of standing - wave solution to be close to that of a lsio , and our approximation to a large extent is based on interpreting a standing - wave solution to be approximately a lsio . in the weak field region",
    "this lsio can be deconstructed into outgoing and ingoing pieces and this deconstruction can be continued to the strong field source region .",
    "( in the source region , the outgoing piece is simply half the solution . ) by doubling the outgoing piece thus extracted from the standing - wave solution , we thereby arrive at an approximation to the outgoing solution for a nonlinear problem .",
    "it is in this manner that we will extract an approximation of an outgoing solution from a computed standing - wave solution .",
    "this is an appropriate place to point out , though not for the last time , the importance of model problems . in einstein s theory there is no obvious meaning to the periodic outgoing solution , so one can not make statements about it , let alone carry out numerical studies .",
    "statements and computations _ are _",
    "possible for nonlinear model problems , so that tests of effective linearity with such models are crucial .",
    "the outgoing solutions extracted from our exact periodic solutions can serve two purposes .",
    "first , we can use a quasistationary sequence of outgoing approximations as a model for the slow physical inspiral . in this approach the mass of the system , measured in a weak wave zone far from the orbiting sources , decreases due to the loss of energy in outgoing radiation .",
    "when we find the system energy as a function of orbit radius , and we compute the outgoing radiation , we can infer the rate at which the orbital radius decreases .",
    "the difficulty , as with any such quasistationary sequence , is how to know that we are comparing the `` same '' system at different radii . in the case of neutron star",
    "s the answer is clear ; baryon number is an unchanging tag that identifies neutron stars to be the same . for black holes ,",
    "the equivalent tag would be some local mass .",
    "the concept of an isolated horizon@xcite might give us that local mass .    the second use for our extracted outgoing solutions",
    "is to provide initial data for evolution codes .",
    "a spacelike slice of our extracted outgoing field will be an excellent approximation to the physical initial data , and should be very nearly a solution to the initial value equations . with little change our extracted outgoing initial data , can be made into exact ( numerical ) initial data through the use of york s decomposition@xcite .",
    "these two purposes of our solution are not distinct . the natural end point for a quasistationary sequence of psw solutions",
    "is the `` last orbit , '' the final stage of motion at almost constant radius .",
    "this stage may end due to a secular instability , like that of a particle in a black hole spacetime , or due to the imminence of the merger , the formation of the final black hole . in either case , this end point must be handled by a numerical evolution code , and in either case , the quasistationary sequence will provide ideal initial data for the continuation of the problem by numerical evolution .      in the standard approach to computing binary inspiral",
    ", initial data are evolved forward in time . in our approach , with periodic symmetry imposed , there is no evolution in the usual sense , and there is not the usual concept of initial data .",
    "rather we must satisfy boundary conditions at large radius : outgoing , ingoing or standing - wave boundary conditions in model problems , and only standing - wave conditions in general relativity .",
    "the boundary value problems that we must solve differ in two important ways from common boundary value problems .",
    "first , our partial differential equations ( pdes ) are of _ mixed _ type .",
    "they are of elliptical character in some regions and hyperbolic character in others ; this will be particularly clear in the model problem to be presented below .",
    "we will argue that the mixed character causes no fundamental difficulty , and will demonstrate this with the model problems .",
    "the mixed character , however , does complicate the use of some of the most efficient numerical means of solving bounary value problems .",
    "second , we must define what we mean by `` standing - wave boundary conditions . ''",
    "unlike outgoing and ingoing conditions , there is no simple local condition corresponding to what we will mean by standing waves in a nonlinear problem .",
    "we will present two fundamentally different candidates for the standing - wave condition , and here will present results of computations with one those of those two choices .",
    "( the alternative choice of standing - wave condition is best implemented with a special numerical method , and will be presented elsewhere@xcite . )    stepping back from such details , one may be led to ask more fundamental questions about the whole approach .",
    "such questions arise especially because the psw spacetime we compute has some awkward features .",
    "since the exact psw solution contains an infinite amount of gravitational wave radiation , it can not be expected to be meet the asymptotic flatness conditions of the theorems about the fall - off of fields .",
    "but the spacetime _ is _ asymptotically flat in that the spacetime curvature decreases with increasing distance from the binary source .",
    "another sign that the psw spacetime has rough edges is that it must not have regular null infinities ; gibbons and stewart@xcite have shown that spacetimes with well - behaved scri+ and scri can not be periodic .",
    "it is useful , before diving into details , to clarify what the relationship is between the slightly singular spacetime we will be computing , and the physical problem that really interests us . to make this connection we can think of the binary system going through several orbits at almost constant radius .",
    "a weak wave zone exists at some distance from the orbit during this epoch of the motion .",
    "the stippled region in fig .",
    "[ fig : pswpic ] shows the relevant region as part of the larger physical spacetime . in this limited region the source motion and the fields are almost periodic , and it is in this region only that we hope to approximate the physical fields by the outgoing fields extracted from the computed psw solution .",
    "the imperfect asymptotic structure of the psw spacetime is therefore irrelevant to its physical usefulness .    ,",
    "scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in the remainder of this paper we will first present , in sec .  [ sec : periodic ] , the mathematical details of a nonlinear model with which we clarify many aspects of the psw approximation .",
    "we then discuss , in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] , the numerical methods needed to find psw solutions , especially those aspects of the numerical methods that are idiosyncratic to the special features ( mixed character , standing - wave boundary conditions , nonlinearities ) of our problem . in this section also , results are presented of the numerical methods .",
    "the results are discussed , and put into the context of the next steps in this project@xcite , in sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] .",
    "as stated above , we seek a solution to einstein s equations in which the sources and the fields rotate rigidly .",
    "the mathematical statement of this rigid rotation is that there is a helical killing vector , a killing vector that is timelike close to the sources and spacelike far from the sources .",
    "( for more on helical killing symmetry see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) for fields in flat spacetime our killing vector @xmath7 takes the form @xmath8 in spherical or cylindrical spatial coordinates , and @xmath9 in cartesian spatial coordinates .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 , which must be a constant , can be thought of as the rotation rate of the source and fields with respect to an inertial reference frame . for the flat spacetime case ,",
    "the null surface @xmath10 is a cylinder of radius @xmath11 coaxial with the rotation axis .",
    "( here and below we use units in which @xmath12 . )",
    "this cylinder separates the inner region of timelike @xmath7 from the outer region of spacelike @xmath7 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cylandsphere ] . since this surface , in a sense , represents the points at which the rigidly rotating fields are moving at @xmath13 , we call this surface the `` light cylinder , '' in analogy with pulsar electrodynamics .    ]    one immediate advantage of the helical symmetry is that it reduces the number of independent variables , thereby greatly reducing the computational difficulty of a problem . in our simple flat spacetime models this reduction",
    "is most easily understood by the fact that helically symmetric scalars can not depend in an arbitrary way on the spherical minkowski coordinates @xmath14 but can depend only on @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the combination @xmath17 .",
    "thus , in the @xmath18 system the killing vector is @xmath19 .",
    "these ideas are clarified with a simple flat spacetime model theory for a scalar field @xmath20 @xmath21 the term @xmath22 is included to allow for nonlinearity ; the constant @xmath23 adjusts the strength of the nonlinearity . in order for a helically symmetric solution @xmath20 to exist , the explicit coordinate dependence of @xmath24 must be compatible with the symmetry .",
    "that is , @xmath24 can have explicit coordinate dependence only on @xmath5 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the most natural choice for a model would be one in which there is no coordinate dependence , one in which the background spacetime is featureless .",
    "we include the possibility of spatial dependence for convenience below .",
    "changing the spatial dependence will help to clarify the accuracy of the psw approximation when nonlinearities are important .    in the application of the psw method to holes , an inner boundary condition will be used at a small , approximately spherical surface . for simplicity here , however , we use an explicit source term , @xmath27\\,,\\ ] ] representing two points , each of unit scalar charge , in equatorial circular orbits , with radius @xmath28 and angular velocity @xmath6 . this source term",
    "@xmath29 obeys the symmetry property that is necessary if a periodic solution is to exist : its lie derivative vanishes along the killing orbit @xmath30 .",
    "if we are interested only in helically symmetric solutions , then the field equation ( [ modelscalar ] ) reduces to @xmath31\\,\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial\\varphi^2}+\\lambda f(\\psi , r,\\theta,\\varphi)=s(r,\\theta,\\varphi)\\ .\\ ] ] the mixed character of this pde shows clearly in the coefficient of @xmath32 .",
    "the light cylinder is at @xmath33 where this coefficient changes sign . inside the light cylinder ( @xmath34 ) the equation is elliptical ; outside it is hyperbolic . for outgoing solutions of this equation we impose an outer boundary condition @xmath35 , or equivalently @xmath36 , on a spherical surface with a radius large compared to @xmath11 .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cylandsphere ] , this spherical surface is well outside the light cylinder in the equatorial plane , so our boundary conditions are imposed on a surface that passes through both the elliptic and hyperbolic regions of the problem .",
    "problems with boundary conditions on closed surfaces are common in the case of elliptical pdes .",
    "we argue here that our boundary value problem with mixed pdes may be unusual , but is well posed@xcite .",
    "again , a simple model problem will help to clarify issues .",
    "we set the nonlinearity parameter @xmath23 to zero in eq .",
    "( [ helical3dscalar ] ) so that we can solve the resulting linear equation as an infinite series .",

    "vanishing of the @xmath43 denominator means that the the `` cavity '' @xmath44 has a resonant mode at frequency @xmath6 . in the case",
    "that @xmath38 has one of the resonant values , the solution to the boundary value problem is not unique .",
    "such values of @xmath5 are of zero measure , but are dense in the set of all @xmath5 choices .",
    "this means that the cavity is always arbitrarily close to a resonance , if sufficiently high angular modes are computed .",
    "a consequence of this is that a numerical computation does not converge .",
    "( computed solutions depend on the computational grid size , and become larger with increasing angular resolution . )",
    "the difficulty is not just one of computational practice .",
    "the boundary value problem is fundamentally ill - posed as a representation of fields in an infinite space .",

    "thus , @xmath55 , as @xmath45 , suggesting that the linear problem is well posed@xcite .",

    "( [ sommerfeld ] ) , we have encountered no fundamental difficulty computing convergent solutions to both the linear and nonlinear versions of eq .",
    "( [ helical3dscalar ] ) , and have confirmed that solutions do not depend on the particular ( large ) value chosen for @xmath38 .",
    "the solutions we will be computing in einstein s theory , of course , are standing wave solutions , but there are no actual `` standing wave boundary conditions '' analogous to the sommerfeld condition in eq .",
    "( [ sommerfeld ] ) for outgoing waves .",
    "it is useful , therefore , to explore the meaning of standing - wave solutions with our model nonlinear theories . as pointed out in sec .",

    "we shall extend this definition of standing wave to nonlinear theories in two ways .",
    "the first is an extension of the green function method of ref .",
    "@xcite , and is called there the tsgf ( time symmetric green function ) method . for the problem in eq .",

    "the result would be the improved approximation @xmath62 to the outgoing waves . to find standing waves ,",
    "this method is modified as follows .",
