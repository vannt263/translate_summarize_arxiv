    "a merger history has most recently been suggested for ngc  1851 , on the basis of detailed spectroscopic analysis of a large sample of red giants @xcite .",
    "indeed , the existence of a small but non - negligible metallicity spread in this cluster had also been suggested previously by @xcite , who first hinted that the cluster s metallicity distribution may actually be bimodal .    as pointed out by @xcite , the presence of bimodal , or even multi - modal , metallicity distributions is generally expected , in the case of the gc merger scenario originally envisaged by @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the empirical evidence suggests that mergers of clusters of different metallicities may have been few in the milky way and its immediate vicinity @xcite .",
    "however , the situation may be more favorable in other environments . in particular , in the antenn galaxy ( ngc  4038/ngc  4039 )",
    ", gravitationally bound clusters appear to exist with a sizeable difference in ages , hence possibly also metallicity .",
    "these objects will eventually merge   and , if they survive long enough , will eventually lead to gc - like objects with bimodal , and possibly multi - modal distributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in a more general sense , mergers of star clusters may play an important role in the explanation of the complex abundance patterns that are observed in galactic gcs , which include not only metallicity spreads in massive systems like @xmath2  centauri ( ngc  5139 ) and m54 ( ngc  6715 ) , but also evidence of multiple populations , as indicated by the abundances of chemical species such as o , na , mg , al , and also the observed color - magnitude diagrams ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in this paper , we will explicitly tackle only the aforementioned _ global _ metallicity variations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is accordingly to provide the first numerical simulation of a gc merger involving components of different ages and metallicities . indeed , while other simulations of gc mergers have been carried out by other authors , including @xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , to the best of our knowledge , ours is the first study to explicitly track the metallicity of the individual stars in the course of the merger ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in  [ sec.ansatz ]",
    "we provide more details regarding the properties of potential merger progenitors in the antenn galaxy , as direct motivation for our numerical experiments . in  [ sec.numerical ] , we describe our numerical simulations , along with the region of parameter space explored in our calculations . in  [ sec.results ] we present our main results , with particular emphasis on the resulting color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and the change in cluster shape as a function of time . in  [ sec.results2 ]",
    "we show the impact of the size and king parameter on the merger product . in sections  [ sec.rot ] and  [ sec.omecen ] we present an analysis of the rotation of the merged clusters and the particular case of @xmath1 cen . finally , in  [ sec.summary ] we summarize our results and present some additional discussion .",
    "observations of colliding galaxies such as the antenn galaxy show bound systems of young , massive clusters . in this system , _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) observations exhibit relatively small regions spanning a few hundreds of pc embracing hundreds or even thousands of young clusters , i.e. clusters of clusters or `` cluster complexes '' ( cc from now onwards , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these have been proposed to be the progenitors of ultra - compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) or even massive gcs as a result of the agglomeration of hundreds of their member clusters @xcite .",
    "there are different reasons why two clusters participating in a collision may have different metal contents .",
    "for instance , fe is produced during supernova explosions ( sne ) , which create a very fast moving gas that can not be retained in the cluster because of its shallow potential well ( unless the cluster was born at least 10 times more massive than it is today ; see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in a star forming region",
    ", this gas can mix with gas clouds surrounding the parent cluster and , after slowing and cooling down , create a new , younger cluster   the child cluster   with a characteristic stellar fe abundance higher than the one characterizing the stars of the parent cluster .",
    "the child and parent clusters can then merge with one another , giving birth to another cluster with two well - defined stellar populations : the metal - poor stars of the parent cluster and the metal - rich stars of the child cluster .",
    "indeed , recent detailed observations of some of the antenn galaxy s ccs ( such as the `` knot s '' and `` knot b '' ) @xcite typically show a single massive cluster older ( habitually by a few tens of myr ) than the rest of the members of the cc located at the centre of a giant molecular cloud . @xcite",
    "suggest that the characteristic location of the older cluster and its age might be explained in terms of interactions between the older cluster and the gas cloud .",
    "the difference in age would be an indicator that the giant stars in the old cluster have released gas because of sn explosions , thus polluting the surrounding gas .",
    "therefore , the stars of the new clusters must have a clear - cut different fe abundance .",
    "these ccs might accordingly be a natural breeding ground for multi - metallic gcs , because they have different ab initi@xmath3 metallicities , collide , and merge .",
    "indeed , evidence of already merged clusters in the antenn gaxaxy has been found by @xcite who observed the spectrum of a massive star cluster of this galaxy and concluded that the cluster is a superposition of a young and an older one with ages below @xmath4 myr and between @xmath5 myr respectively ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the observed age - difference may plausibly be accompanied by a difference in the metallicity of the two populations .",

    "+    we run direct - summation @xmath0body simulations of clusters with initially different metallicity contents and ages to investigate this and analyse the impact of dynamics on the occupation fractions of the different populations in the cmds .",
    "we set initially the clusters on a parabolic orbit so that the minimum distance at which they pass by is @xmath17 if they are considered to be point particles at their centers of mass , as described in @xcite .",
    "we use a @xcite initial mass function for the stars of the clusters with mass limits 0.2 @xmath18 and 100 @xmath18 .",
    "we integrate the evolution with direct - summation @xmath0body tools , which integrate all gravitational forces for all particles at every time step , without making any a priori assumptions about the system .",
    "the code we have employed , nbody6-gpu , uses the improved hermite integration scheme @xcite .",
    "this needs computation of not only the accelerations , but also their time derivatives .",
    "the programme also includes _",
    "ks regularisation _ and _ chain regularisation _ , so that when particles are tightly bound or their separation becomes too small during a hyperbolic encounter , the system is regularised @xcite to prevent too small individual time steps .",
    "we ran different cases with different initial conditions , as shown in table  [ tab.initdata ] .",
    "the clusters , assumed to be isolated , were modelled initially with a king model of different concentrations w0 @xcite , radii and metallicities and evolved for different times with the stellar evolution package sse , described in @xcite .",
    "for the particular case @xmath19 , we use the outcome of simulation @xmath20 and make it merge with another cluster ( numbered 3 ) on a parabolic orbit with a new @xmath21 and @xmath22 , as indicated on the right of table  [ tab.initdata ] . during the collision we neglect stellar evolution ,",
    "because in all runs it took approximately a few myr and the impact of evolving the masses on the global dynamics is negligible .",
    "we find in our simulations a significant mass loss after the merger of the clusters that affects the different occupational fraction numbers of the cmds .",
    "to determine when the clusters merge , we locate the density centers of the two clusters and that of the merged system following @xcite .",
    "we follow the simulations after the density centres have coincided for about one half - mass relaxation time @xmath23 of the final cluster .",
    "this allows us to study the distribution of stars due to the dynamics of the system , which is important to understand the impact of mass loss in the cmd and occupational fractions in different shells of mass around the density center of the merged system .",
    "naturally , the cmd we obtain from the simulations corresponds to idealised observational conditions . in real observations",
    "the measurements are affected by both random and systematic errors and completeness .",
    "photometric errors are not constant with apparent magnitude . in general ,",
    "more luminous stars have smaller photometric errors .",
    "this is described in fig .",
    "5 of @xcite and also in table 2 of @xcite , which show the exponential growth of the photometric errors with apparent magnitude . also , faint stars are hard to detect , so the cmd suffers from completeness ( i.e. only a fraction of the faint stars are actually observed )",
    ". a description of the completeness in the cmd of real clusters is given in fig .",
    "1 of @xcite and also in fig . 9 and",
    "table 7 of @xcite . for the transformation of our theoretical cmd to the `` real '' cmd that one would observe ,",
    "we introduce an exponential function to guide the photometric errors , which are then selected from a gaussian random distribution .",
    "we also included a function for the completeness of the cmd , assuming completeness 100% for stars with high luminosities and 0% for low - luminosity stars .    in figure  [ fig.cmd_e ]",
    "we show the theoretical and observational cmd of simulation @xmath19 , assuming that the clusters are at a distance of 5 mpc . as it is obvious ,",
    "just a fraction of the upper part of the cmd of such a cluster could be observed with future telescopes , but the signature of the merger of three clusters would still be detectable .",
    "we can see that at the level of the turn - off point ( to ) the sgb splits into three well - defined branches , resembling the cmds presented by @xcite . while such cmds are not typically found in the milky way and its immediate vicinity , they will likely be more commonplace in the antennae galaxy s gc system , several gyr from now .",
    "this , in turn , suggests that other galaxies with more violent past histories than the milky way may also be more likely to harbor such gc systems .",
    "candidate hosts for such multi - metallic merged clusters , in this sense , may include m82 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , at a distance of @xmath24  mpc @xcite , and even m31 itself ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , at a distance of @xmath25  kpc @xcite .",
    "we then calculate the occupation ratio of the different stellar populations , @xmath26 ( and @xmath27 $ ] , if we had three different populations ) for different shells starting at the density center .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab.occupfrac ] .",
    "the distribution of the different populations in the final , merged cluster depends mostly on the initial size , concentration , metallicities , and also on the initial number of stars in each cluster , as well as their initial mass functions and ages . in most of our models ( all but @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , the metal - rich cluster , which is always cluster 1 , appears to contribute fewer stars to the center of the merged cluster than the metal - poor population .",
    "this appears to be a natural result of the initial parameters chosen and more specifically of the different initial size of the clusters , as we will see below .",
    "@xmath1  cen is the system for which we have the best observational data about the radial distribution of its multiple populations .",
    "@xcite do a detailed study showing that stars belonging to the blue ms ( bms ) appear to be more centrally concentrated than stars of the red ms ( rms ) , with the fraction @xmath30 outside the core of the system . since the bms contains stars with greater metallicity , according to the authors , stars with greater metallicity appear to be more centrally concentrated . as shown in table  [ tab.occupfrac ] , one of our models ( @xmath28 ) shows a distribution in which the metal - rich ( mr ) stars appear more centrally concentrated relative to the metal - poor ( mp ) stars of the merged cluster . in the same model ,",
    "mp stars appear to dominate the region 1 - 3 pc , while metal - rich stars again dominate the external shells of the cluster as a result of the large difference in the initial concentration of the two clusters and in their initial size .",
    "we caution the reader , however , that @xmath1  cen may be a much more complex case than described by our models , since its progenitor system must have been much more massive in the past ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and the present - day @xmath1  cen is characterized by a broad , continuum metallicity distribution , which we are not in a position to properly describe with our relatively simple @xmath31-body models , which imply sharply - peaked ( if multimodal ) metallicity distributions .    in this context",
    ", our models may fare somewhat better in the case of ngc  1851 . in this case",
    ", @xcite observed evidence of a difference in the distribution of the two populations of red giants .",
    "according to them , the mp component seems to be more centrally concentrated than the mr one .",
    "this observational evidence , which however remains somewhat controversial @xcite , contradicts a scenario for the formation of the second population of stars within the same cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which foresees that the metal - rich population should be more concentrated around the center . in this sense",

    "the gc achieves average values after almost one @xmath23 , so that any oblateness would not be present today in clusters older than their half - mass relaxation time , unless the collision happened recently ( though we note that we can not model realistic gcs with our number of stars ) .",
    "this means that gcs , in particular young ones , with @xmath42 above average , are more likely to harbour populations of stars displaying multi - metallicity ; i.e. , any amount of rotation in gcs with multiple metallicities could be a fingerprint for a dynamical origin .",
    "after the collision , and for a significant fraction of the relaxation time , the resulting cluster has a significant amount of rotation .",
    "this depends on the initial conditions such as the impact parameter , the @xcite parameter w0 and the relative velocity .    in figure  [ fig.ellipticity_d ]",
    "we show @xmath42 vs time for @xmath32 .",
    "we start the analysis after the three density centers coincide .",
    "the system has an @xmath42 above average during a relatively long time and only after @xmath43 @xmath42 does it reach the average @xmath44 .",
    "this suggests that cluster mergers may lead , at least for almost one @xmath45 , to peculiarly flattened systems , whose flattening may be ascribed to their acquired angular momentum during the merger event .",
    "consequently , a correlation between multi - metallic stellar populations , ellipticity and rotation may be expected , in the case of a merger origin .",
    "note that increased ellipticity was also found in the merger simulations presented by @xcite and @xcite , among others .",
    "do multi - metallic gcs show systematically high ellipticies and rapid rotation ?",
    "unfortunately , a conclusive answer to this question can not be provided at present , given the exceedingly small number of known multi - metallic gcs in the local universe .",
    "still , some of the available evidence appears quite suggestive .",
    "@xmath1  cen , in particular , is well known to be one of the most oblate galactic gcs , as also confirmed by the recent , homogeneous measurements of 116 gcs presented by @xcite , based on 2mass images .",
    "cen has rotational velocity @xmath46 , which makes it one of the fastest rotating gcs in the galaxy .",
    "this could be a signature for an agglomeration process of a cluster in a cc which receives more and more impacts from other lighter clusters and `` runs away '' in mass , on its way to forming a ucd .",
    "measurements of the rotation of the @xmath47 stars of @xmath1  cen @xcite show that all subpopulations rotate as a single one ( see also * ? ? ? * for a study of the proper motions of the subpopulations that supports this result ) .",
    "this can also be explained in terms of a collision between gcs , which would assign all stars the same amount of rotation regardless of their population .",
    "other galactic gcs for which a metallicity spread has recently been claimed include m22  =  ngc  6656 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ngc  2419 @xcite , both of which are also significantly flattened @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite have suggested that the latter cluster may be the result of a merged star cluster complex , during the interaction between a gas - rich galaxy and the milky way .",
    "very recently , @xcite has also considered the possibility that such clusters may originate from mergers , with the possible production of multi - modal metallicity distributions .",
    "interestingly , @xcite have suggested that the observed elongation of the starburst cluster westerlund  1 may similarly be ascribed to mergers . on the other hand , one should be careful to note that gc ellipticities may be due to a variety of physical mechanisms , which are not always easy to disentangle .",
    "for instance , @xcite note that the gc wlm-1 in the wlm dwarf galaxy in the local group , in spite of being one of the most elongated gcs known , and of being subject to very minor tidal stresses , does not show any evidence of rotation .",
    "we are clearly in face of a very complex phenomenon , which can not be explained in terms of any simple scenario .",
    "still , it does appear like mergers may play an important role in at least some cases , and we accordingly suggest that the connection between multimodal metallicity distributions , ellipticity , and rotation be further explored , whenever gc candidates with multiple metallicities may be detected .",
    "in order to understand the impact of the king parameter w0 in the final distribution of different populations as a function of the distance from the density centre of the merged system , we run a set of 128 simulations with a setup that has the same initial numerical setup as case @xmath20 of table [ tab.initdata ] and the same ages .",
    "we explore different parameters , and only fix the number of stars , the radii , and metallicities , as summarised in table [ tab.table1 ] . in this first exploration",
    "we set cluster 2 to have half the size of cluster 1 .    .",
    "fixed parameters for the detailed analysis of case @xmath20 of the role of the king paramter .",
    "the total mass of the system is 60k @xmath48 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in our simulations we are limited in our study of the vast parameter space by our code .",
    "while direct - summation techniques are very robust , they scale typically as @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , the approach we use to evolve the clusters and their metallicities is rather simplistic compared to what happens in real clusters .",
    "nevertheless , in figure  [ fig.comparomegacen ] we present a comparison of our scenario with observations of @xmath1 cen , in particular with the data presented in the work of @xcite . in the left panel of the figure we can see that the observed data of @xmath1 cen follows the trend of the shape of the rest of curves at smaller radii .",
    "while we are not limited in our resolution at smaller radii , observations are but , on the other hand , we are comparing a very massive cluster , actually an ultra - compact dwarf galaxy with a model of two clusters of 30,000 stars each . at larger radii , the observed data of @xmath1 cen suits best the model in which the two clusters had a king parameter of 6 . on the right panel",
    "we observe the same discrepancy that we already had in our figures  [ fig.fig_equal_w ] and [ fig2.fig_equal_w ] at larger radii .",
    "therefore it seems that @xmath1 cen was probably formed out of the merger of clusters that initially had a similar size , mass and king parameter .",
    "nonetheless , the star resolution is well below the number of stars that we expect in @xmath1 cen , and the simulations might depend on the masses and sizes of the simulated clusters , so that this result should be taken carefully but , in any case , is an encouraging motivation for further probing this scenario .",
    "motivated by the seemingly unavoidable future merger of clusters with different ages and hence with potentially different metallicities in the antenn galaxy , in this paper we have presented direct - summation @xmath31-body simulations of such a merger process .",
    "such mergers were addressed in the past by different authors , but ours is the first study to explicitly tackle the possibility of multiple metallicities being present in the merging clusters .",
    "interacting galaxies such as the antenn are natural loci for multi - metallic clusters to collide . in the antenn ,",
    "ccs have been observed with the hst and they are the natural birth - place of ucds , as explained previously . while dynamics does not affect the shape of the resulting cmd of the merged system , it impinges the number of stars in different radial regions of the resulting merger : the occupation fraction will vary with radius , because of the dynamics .    in the first part of this article we have run a sample of simulations in which we vary all relevant parameters for the final distribution of stars in the merged cluster .",
    "we conclude that the initial concentration of the clusters , metallicities , initial ages and sizes play an important role in the final distribution .",
    "the differences in the features of the original clusters may well be observed in the cmd of the final cluster , which consists of multiple lines , which might appear merged together in the lower part of the diagram , but could be clearly distinguishable in its upper part , even if the distance to the cluster is up to 5 mpc .",
    "we note that our simulations show that clusters that are created by mergers of smaller clusters exhibit phases with ellipticity above the observational average .",
    "this indicates that future observations of young clusters hosting multiple stellar populations should focus on oblate cluster with high rotation .",
    "in the second part of the paper we perform an exhaustive analysis of the role of the king parameter and the size of the clusters in the final distribution of stars .",
    "we adapt case @xmath20 as our fiducial scenario and fix the number of stars , the metallicity and age .",
    "we start by fixing the size of the clusters , so that one is twice as large as the other one and run 128 simulations ( of 8 realisations of each combination of w0 king parameters , to vary the random seed ) .",
    "we find that the dominant parameter on the final distribution of stars is the initial difference of sizes of the clusters .",
    "almost totally independent on the rest of parameters the occupation fractional number is @xmath50 closer to the centre of the cluster and @xmath51 outside in all simulations .",
    "we then investigate the role of the metallicity and age by running a set of 32 simulations in which the two clusters have equal sizes .",
    "in most of the cases , and independently of w0 , the core of the final cluster is dominated by stars from cluster 1",
    ". however , the outer parts of the systems are mostly affected by the initial difference in the choice for w0 .",
    "although we can not add abundance ratios for many different chemical species to our models , our analysis provides guidance into some possible observational signatures of merger events , including the possible presence of increased rotation and high ellipticity , associated with the existence of multiple metallicities in individual , present - day gcs .    in particular",
    ", it is remarkable to see that the set of models in which the clusters had initially the same size leads to a distribution of occupational fractions rather close to what is _ observed _ in @xmath1 cen .",
    "therefore , in this scenario in which different populations are a fingerprint of cluster mergers , @xmath1 cen was formed out of collisions among clusters with relatively similar sizes , which is reasonable , since @xmath1 cen has been proposed to have formed in a cluster complex dynamically , and the clusters that lead to the formation of a runanay seed ultra - compact dwarf galaxy have a similar mass and size , due to mass segregation , as in the work of @xcite",
