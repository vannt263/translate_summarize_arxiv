    "<S> we investigate the lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) decays , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath2 , and the newly observed muon @xmath3 anomaly in the framwork of a squential fourth generation model with a heavy fourth neutrino , @xmath4 . by using the recent experimental bounds , we take the constraints of the @xmath5 leptonic mixing matrix element factors , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . we find that lfv decays and @xmath9 can exclude most of the parameter space of the 4th generation neutrino mass @xmath10 and give stringent constraints on the existence of the fourth generation .    </S>",
    "<S> = -30 mm    at present , standard model ( sm ) has to face the experimental difficaties which are all relate to leptons . </S>",
    "<S> it seems to indicate the presence of new physics just round the cornor will be in the leptonic part . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , there are convincing evdences that neutrinos are massive and oscillate in flavor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the recent measurment of the muon anomalous magnetic moment by the experiment e821 @xcite at brookhaven national laboratory disagrees with the sm expectations at more than 2.6@xmath11 level ( the new deviation drops to to 1.6@xmath11@xcite ) .    defined as @xmath12 , </S>",
    "<S> the recent measurement of @xmath13 is @xmath14 where the sm prediction is @xmath15 thus , one finds , @xmath16 which gives the old @xmath17 deviation . </S>",
    "<S> but the revised difference between experiment and sm is @xmath18 which is now only a @xmath19 deviation . </S>",
    "<S> although the deviation drops from @xmath17 to @xmath19 , it might seem that the absolute magnitude of the deviation may be a hint of new physics . </S>",
    "<S> there have been a lot of scenarios of new physics proposed to interpret the non - vanishing and positive value of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> many of these new physics effects can also contribute to the lepton flavor violation processes , such as @xmath21 ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath2 . in this note , we consider the sequential fourth generation standard model ( sm4 ) to investigate its contributions to @xmath13 and some leptonic flavor violation decays .    from the point of phenomenology </S>",
    "<S> , there is a realistic question what are numbers of the fermions generation or weather there are other additional quarks or leptons . </S>",
    "<S> the present experiments tell us there are only three generation fermions with @xmath22 neutrinos which mass are less smaller than @xmath23@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but the experiments do nt exclude the existence of other additional generation , such as the fourth generation , with a @xmath24 neutrino , i.e. @xmath25@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many refs . have studied the sm4 @xcite , which is added an up - like quark @xmath26 , a down - like quark @xmath27 , a lepton @xmath28 , and a heavy neutrino @xmath29 in the sm . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of these new fermions are all the same as their corresponding counterparts of other three generations except their masses and ckm mixing , see tab.1 ,    .the elementary particle spectrum of sm4 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if there exists a very heavy fourth neurino @xmath4 , it can contribute to @xmath13 and lepton flavor violation decays through diagram of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . this is the electroweak interaction . </S>",
    "<S> similar to that of quarks , the corresponding lagragian is @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the @xmath33 and @xmath34 elements of the four - generaton lepton mixing mns matrix ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath35    reverting back to the diagrams of fig . 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we see that the fourth neutrino contribution to decays @xmath36 and @xmath2 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . we do nt consider the three usual neutrinos contribution because their masses are too small mass and have almost no effects on lfv decays and anomalous magnetic moment of leptons . because of its heavy mass , the 4th neutrino @xmath4 in sm4 can induce these decays . </S>",
    "<S> calculating fig . 1 , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the fine constrcture constant and @xmath39 simlarly , we obtain latexmath:[\\[{\\rm \\gamma}(\\tau\\to e\\gamma ) = \\frac{\\alpha g_f^2 m^5_\\tau}{96 }    latexmath:[\\[{\\rm \\gamma}(\\mu\\to e\\gamma ) = \\frac{\\alpha g_f^2 m^5_\\mu}{96 }    experimental bounds of these three lfv processes @xcite , we obtain the parameter space of other @xmath5 matrix elements of leptonic mixing , ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . from figs . 2 , considering the unitarity of the matrix @xmath41 , we find the reasonable range of @xmath42 is under the curve .    </S>",
    "<S> the lagragian related to @xmath9 is @xmath43 from this lagragian , we see that the fourth neutrino contribution to @xmath13 is @xmath44    we suppose that the 1.6@xmath11 discrepancy of muon anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath45 , is induced by the fourth sequential neutrino @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we can use the above equation to get parameter space of @xmath46 and @xmath47 to @xmath10 ( see fig . 3 and 4 ) , @xmath48    from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , we can see that @xmath46 is taken negative values except for a very narrow range of @xmath10 which is from 58 gev to 80 gev . in other words , the sign of @xmath49 is only related to @xmath50 mass . only in this narrow mass range , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 gives positive contribution to @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the low bound of @xmath10 we get from @xmath9 is consistent with the present experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let s look at the parameter space of the mns matrix element factors again . considering the constraint from @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> , we see that the upper bounds of @xmath10 do nt exceed 80 gev . although the low bound of @xmath10 we get from @xmath51 is consistent with the present experiments @xcite , the upper bound of @xmath10 , @xmath52 , seems to conflict with the current experiments statue which there is no any new physics signals upper to several gevs . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth generation particles seems not to be so light . </S>",
    "<S> they should be several hundred gevs weight.moreover , from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 , if we consider the unitarity of the matrix @xmath41 and tiny values of its elements , the reasonable value range of @xmath53 will be more narrow .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the contribution of the fourth generation to @xmath3 and lfv decays and get an interesting result which we can exclude most values of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> considering the current experimental bounds , we give the parameter space of @xmath10 and lepton mixing matrix element @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that lfv processes can constrain on the neutrino mass of the fourth generation : i.e. its mass should be lighter than 80 gev . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that from the lepton part , the current experiments can impose a stringent constraint on the existence of the fourth generation . </S>"
