    "it has been argued by aharonov and susskind that in principle the relative phase between charge eigenstates can be inferred statistically .",
    "this method , however , is not the same as doing projective measurements of observables whose eigenstates are superpositions of charge eigenstates .",
    "such projective measurements are the ones we are considering in this paper .",
