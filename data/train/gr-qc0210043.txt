    "a number of large laser interferometers @xcite are approaching sensitivities to gravitational waves in the @xmath0 hz frequency band that could be sufficient for the detection of astrophysical events @xcite .",
    "the signals from these events will be buried deep in the instrumental noise , so that unambiguous detections will be possible only with highly efficient data processing algorithms .",
    "the focus of this article will be on transient sources of gravitational radiation , which will be defined as sources that have a relatively short duration ( milliseconds to tens of seconds ) and a bandwidth which overlaps at least partially with that of the interferometric detectors .",
    "a significant number of such transient sources have been theorized , with various levels of sophistication .",
    "for instance , the inspiral portion of coalescing compact binaries is well - understood ( by post - newtonian expansion techniques @xcite ) , as is the ring - down portion if a black hole results from the coalescence @xcite , but the merger portion is understood at best only qualitatively @xcite .",
    "as the mass of the binary increases , the signal - to - noise ratio of the merger portion dominates that of the inspiral and ringdown portions ; the coalescence of @xmath1 black hole binaries could be visible at large distances , provided that the merger waveform could be detected with sufficient efficiency @xcite .",
    "the collapse of the core of massive stars could also produce detectable signals @xcite ; depending on the type of progenitor , bar modes , r - modes , fragmentation instabilities or black hole ringdowns could be important sources of gravitational radiation .",
    "the details of the waveforms for most of these different mechanisms are far from known ; even in the best cases , only numerical simulations covering parts of the relevant physics are available in the literature @xcite . hence , as it can be seen from the preceding examples ,",
    "the amount of information about the gravitational wave signal from various sources varies considerably , and this variability is obviously reflected in the efficiency of the algorithms that can be designed for each class of sources .",
    "only minimal assumptions about the signal will be made in this paper , and therefore the principal characteristic of the algorithm to be presented will be its robustness against poor modeling of the expected signal waveform . stated differently , this algorithm will be moderately sensitive to a very large class of signals , by opposition to being very sensitive to only a few specific signals",
    ". it will correspondingly be useful to search for transient sources that do not have waveforms that are precisely predicted , and to characterize the non - gaussian , transient component of the noise in the instruments .",
    "it is important when designing a detection algorithm to compare its efficacy to that of other designs ; the development process can stop when an algorithm that outperforms all others is discovered .",
    "various measures of this efficacy can be adopted , and various techniques to obtain the optimal algorithm be used , as it is discussed in section [ transient_detection ] . it is argued that the algorithm that is presented in this article , the tfclusters algorithm , has a structure which is close to that of the optimal detector for a large variety of signal classes .",
    "the tfclusters algorithm is explained in detail in section [ notation ] .",
    "to summarize , it consists of the following four steps :    ( i ) : :    the data @xmath2 from a gravitational wave detector are    transformed into a time - frequency representation with fixed time and    frequency resolutions @xmath3 and @xmath4 ,    respectively ; the instantaneous power at time @xmath5    and frequency @xmath6 , estimated from this    representation , is labeled @xmath7 .",
    "( ii ) : :    a threshold @xmath8 is applied on the power , in order to    retain only pixels with @xmath9 .",
    "( iii ) : :    clusters of pixels with power above threshold are formed by grouping    pixels sharing a common side ; clusters that do not conform to a fixed    set of rules on their size or distance to other clusters are    discarded .",
    "( iv ) : :    a threshold on the sum of @xmath10 over    the surviving clusters is applied .",
    "data segments containing clusters    satisfying this threshold lead to the acceptance of the hypothesis    that they contain a signal .    in order to understand the operating characteristics of this algorithm , a simplified version [ without the clustering analysis , i.e. consisting only of steps ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iv ) ] is shown in section [ optimality ] to maximize for all signals in @xmath11 the signal - to - noise ratio among all detectors that are based on the estimation of a lower bound of the signal power .",
    "this simplified algorithm is especially efficient for signals with a sparse representation in the time - frequency domain .",
    "since most signals are expected to have pixels that present a high degree of spatial correlation in the time - frequency domain , the clustering analysis of tfclusters is an interesting way to capitalize on that property to filter out a large portion of the noise , as it is shown in section [ clustering ] .",
    "an analytical method for computing the false alarm rate associated with tfclusters is developed , with the details for the clustering analysis being presented in section [ clustering_far ] . using the computer - generated enumeration of all the possible clusters of a certain size that can be formed",
    ", it is shown that large clusters are exponentially unlikely to occur when only noise is present .",
    "the rate of occurrence of pairs of clusters separated by a certain distance is computed in an analogous manner .",
    "one example of a complete analysis of the performances of tfclusters for a short , narrow - band signal , including the optimization of its efficiency at fixed false alarm rate , is presented in section [ clustering_pod ] .",
    "the efficiency of tfclusters is compared to that of the ( unrealistic ) ideal power detector ( which assumes a knowledge of the signal duration and central frequency ) as a function of the signal - to - noise ratio of the signal ; at fixed probability of detection , the reduction in signal - to - noise ratio for tfclusters is consistently less than about 30% .",
    "numerical simulations ( section [ simulations ] ) confirm that the analytical model for the false alarm rate is accurate in the regime of operation relevant to tfclusters , with errors on the predicted false alarm rates around 1% in most situations , and with maximum errors around 10% , due to the exclusion of higher - order terms in the theoretical modeling , or to unmodeled finite size effects .",
    "the transient detection problem consists in choosing between two possibilities : the observed data @xmath12 , @xmath13 , consist of a signal term @xmath14 and a noise term @xmath15 , where the noise is additive and is assumed to be white gaussian with zero mean and unit variance @xcite : @xmath16 or the data are noise alone : @xmath17    in the simplest case , @xmath14 is fixed and known . perhaps the most natural optimality criterion is then to maximize the probability of detection when the signal is present for the probability of detection when no signal is present being smaller than some preassigned false alarm probability .",
    "this so - called neyman - pearson criterion leads to the use of the amplitude @xmath18 of the signal , optimally estimated @xcite from the scalar product @xmath19 as the statistic on which the decision between eq .",
    "( [ eq : noise_model_tdom ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : just_noise ] ) is made .    in the case",
    "where @xmath20 for some function space @xmath21 , one can integrate the signal distribution to reduce the problem to the simple case of discerning between two fixed probability distributions , as is done when @xmath14 is fixed and known .",
    "this requires the knowledge of the prior distribution @xmath22",
    "$ ] , and results in using the likelihood ratio @xmath23 = \\frac{\\int_{s(t ) \\in w } p[y(t)|s(t)]p[s(t)]ds(t)}{p[y(t)|0 ] } \\label{eq : int_likeli}\\ ] ] as the detection statistic .",
    "when the prior @xmath22 $ ] is unknown , the choice of an optimality criterion is not as simple as for the fixed signal case ; the _ modified _ neyman - pearson criterion maximizes the minimum of the probability of detection over all @xmath20 , for the false alarm probability being below some preassigned value , and is therefore an interesting `` conservative '' choice .",
    "it is well - known that the optimal algorithm in terms of the modified neyman - pearson criterion is obtained by choosing the prior @xmath22 $ ] that is least - favorable , i.e. the prior that minimizes the minimum over @xmath21 of the probability of detection when the signal is present , at fixed false alarm rate @xcite . in particular , using the generalized likelihood ratio @xmath24 = \\max_{s(t ) \\in w}\\frac{p[y(t)|s(t)]}{p[y(t)|0 ] } \\label{eq : gen_likeli}\\ ] ] as the detection statistic does not guarantee optimality @xcite .    for signals with excellent theoretical models , such as binary neutron star or black hole inspirals ,",
    "the function space @xmath21 is compact enough that the least - favorable prior is approximately uniform in @xmath14 , so that the generalized likelihood ratio [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : gen_likeli ] ) ] derives from eq .",
    "( [ eq : int_likeli ] ) as the optimal detection statistic .",
    "this leads to a convenient implementation @xcite which simply thresholds on the maximum of the correlation [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : match_filter ] ) ] over a filter bank , which is a discretely sampled version of the function space @xmath21 .    for the case where the signal space is not simple enough to allow matched filtering , that is when the signal is not well - modeled ,",
    "a number of incoherent methods have been proposed in the literature .",
    "one of them is the so - called excess power detector @xcite , which basically threshold on the power integrated over a large number of different shapes at different positions in the time - frequency plane . in their discussion of the optimality of the excess power detector , the authors of @xcite use a prior uniform in the `` whitened '' signal subspace of all waveforms of finite duration and bandwidth , which is imposed from physical arguments , and their result is therefore only a proof of optimality with respect to that particular prior . in particular ,",
    "this prior is not necessarily least - favorable , and their result is therefore not a proof of optimality in the modified neyman - pearson sense .",
    "similarly , the author of @xcite chooses a different prior , which is uniform in the `` unwhitened '' signal space , to derive a detector which is optimal with respect to this prior , and which is similar to the excess power detector , but is perhaps better adapted to colored instrumental noise .",
    "in addition to these detectors , a number of _ ad hoc _ methods have been proposed to solve the transient detection problem for unmodeled transients .",
    "they are based on the analysis of patterns in the time - frequency plane @xcite , or on the time - domain analysis of the data with various filters @xcite .",
    "only the authors of @xcite discuss optimality , from a numerical point of view , i.e. by using a small number of simulated signals from @xcite that are injected into noise in numerical simulations in order to compare the performances of a few different detection algorithms .",
    "when the noise is gaussian , the likelihood ratio in eq.([eq : int_likeli ] ) can be rewritten as @xcite : @xmath23 = \\exp\\left[{\\mbox{$\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!-$}}_0^{\\cal{t}}{y(t ) \\hat{s}(t ) dt } - \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^{\\cal{t } }",

    "the symbol @xmath29 represents the it stochastic integral @xcite .",
    "of course , the computation of @xmath25 in eq.([eq : baye_est ] ) requires the knowledge of the prior @xmath22 $ ] , but the structure of eq.([eq : est_likeli ] ) suggests that an efficient approach to problems for which the integration in eq.([eq : int_likeli ] ) can not be carried out effectively ( due to a complex or unknown prior , for instance ) might be to develop efficient estimators of the signal , and to use them as filters to test for the presence of signals in the data ( i.e. , to use an _ estimator - correlator _ design ) .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that ( i ) transforming the ( discretely sampled ) observations @xmath30 to a wavelet basis , ( ii ) applying on the transformed observations @xmath31 the non - linearity @xmath32 for a threshold @xmath33 , and ( iii ) transforming the truncated observations @xmath34 back to the time domain lead to an estimator @xmath35 that is optimal in the sense of giving the smallest value of the maximum of the expected least - square error over a wide class of signals .",
    "using this estimator and preserving the structure of eq.([eq : est_likeli ] ) , a simple quantity to threshold on is @xmath36 which can be rewritten as @xmath37 the algorithmic structure of tfclusters corresponds to this model ; the two principal differences are that a short - time fourier basis is used instead of a wavelet basis , and that an additional step involving the analysis of the correlations between the non - zero components of the estimator @xmath38 is introduced .",
    "it will be assumed that @xmath39 data corresponding to the gravitational wave strain are read and stored as real numbers into a vector @xmath2 .",
    "the data are time ordered and uniformly sampled with sampling frequency @xmath40 , so the @xmath41 component @xmath42 of the vector @xmath2 is the value of the measured strain at time @xmath43 : @xmath44 .",
    "step ( i ) of tfclusters is the construction of the time - frequency representation of the data from the spectrogram : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the @xmath47 component of the discrete fourier transform of the @xmath41 segment of data of length @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath48 is assumed to be even and to be a factor of @xmath39 , so that @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 correspond to dc and to the nyquist frequencies , and will not be considered anywhere below . consequently , the maximum number of useful pixels in the time - frequency representation will be @xmath54 .",
    "the time resolution @xmath3 of the time - frequency representation is fixed and is given by @xmath55 .",
    "the frequency resolution @xmath4 is simply @xmath56 . in this time - frequency representation , the two hypotheses expressed in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : noise_model_tdom ] ) and ( [ eq : just_noise ] ) become @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "if the noise @xmath59 is gaussian and white , the power in different pixels is statistically independent .",
    "when no signal is present , @xmath60 is the sum of the square of two independent gaussian variables with zero mean and equal variance , and is therefore exponentially distributed : @xmath61 when a signal is present , the gaussian variables have non - zero mean , and the probability density function ( hereafter , pdf ) of the power is @xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the modified bessel function of order zero .",
    "the spectrogram representation is of course not the only time - frequency representation available , and may not be optimal for most signal .",
    "it is however the simplest one to work with in this exploratory work .",
    "wavelet bases share the independence property of the noise in the different pixels , as do any orthonormal basis , and they are known to offer better localization properties than fourier transforms for many signals @xcite .",
    "however , their dyadic representation makes their analysis more complicated , due to the varying shape of the pixels with scale .",
    "another classical way to improve the spectrogram representation is to use windows and to overlap the segments .",
    "this is a good way to reduce artifacts from fourier transforms ( e.g. edge effects ) and to increase the time resolution of the time - frequency representation , but at the cost of destroying the statistical independence of the pixels .",
    "this independence is essential for the calculations involved in the clustering analysis presented in section [ clustering ] , and for the correct interpretation of some of the tfclusters thresholds .",
    "any practical implementation of tfclusters can , however , deal equally well with spectrograms built with windows and overlapping segments as it does with the simpler type of spectrogram described above .",
    "step ( ii ) of tfclusters consists in applying a threshold on the power @xmath60 .",
    "pixels with @xmath64 are called _ black _ pixels , and other pixels are called _ white _ pixels . the probability for any given pixel to be black when no signal is present ( the _ black pixel probability _ , @xmath65 ) , is given by : @xmath66 figure [ fig : steps ] illustrates the result from step ( ii ) and the effects of step ( iii ) and ( iv ) below on simulated data .    step ( iii ) of tfclusters considers the clustering of the black pixels .",
    "a cluster is defined as a set of black pixels containing all the black pixels that are the nearest neighbour of any pixel in the set . for a given pixel ,",
    "its nearest neighbours are the pixels immediately to its left and to its right ( time steps immediately before and after ) , and above and below it ( frequency difference equal to the spectrogram resolution @xmath4 ) .",
    "two pixels touching only by a `` corner '' are called _ next _ nearest neighbours . the size @xmath67 of a cluster is simply defined as the number of black pixels it contains . the notion of distance @xmath68 between two clusters @xmath69 and",
    "@xmath70 is defined as the minimal distance @xmath71 between any two pixels @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the two clusters , @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 are the coordinates of @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath72 corresponds to @xmath78 , etc .",
    "hence , nearest neighbour pixels have @xmath79",
    ", next - nearest neighbour pixels have @xmath80 , and any two clusters must have @xmath81 .",
    "this choice of distance is made for convenience , but it has the implication of making the distance isotropic in the spectrogram representation of the time - frequency domain , irrespectively of the actual values of its time and frequency resolutions . building a spectrogram with very long time bins and therefore",
    "very narrow frequency bins would have the effect of making the distances `` longer '' in the frequency direction than a spectrogram with short time bins and wide frequency bins .",
    "thresholds are applied both on the size of the cluster and on its distance to other clusters .",
    "the latter is easily motivated for physical signals ; for example , although clusters of size two that are produced by fluctuations in the noise could be likely in a certain experiment , and therefore be below the size threshold , to have two or more such clusters close from each other , say being next nearest neighbours , could be rather unlikely .",
    "hence , a signal with a well defined frequency that is slowly varying , so that its time - frequency track is a thin curve , could easily produce an archipelago of clusters of size two that is statistically unlikely to be produced by noise fluctuations alone .",
    "if a cluster @xmath69 has size @xmath82 , it is immediately accepted as significant .",
    "otherwise , its distance to all other clusters @xmath70 with size @xmath83 is compared to a threshold @xmath84 which depends explicitly on the size of the two clusters .",
    "all the clusters with @xmath85 are merged into a _",
    "generalized _ cluster , which is declared significant .",
    "if @xmath70 is already in a separate generalized cluster , @xmath69 is added to that generalized cluster .",
    "if no cluster @xmath70 with @xmath83 satisfies the distance criterion , @xmath69 is rejected . for a given choice of the minimum cluster size @xmath86 ,",
    "there are @xmath87 distance thresholds @xmath84 , which will be organized below as a vector @xmath88 : @xmath89 = [ \\delta_{1,1 } , \\delta_{1,2 } , ... , \\delta_{1,\\sigma-1 } , \\delta_{2,2 } , ... , \\delta_{2,\\sigma-1 } , ... , \\delta_{\\sigma-1 , \\sigma-1}].\\ ] ]    finally , step ( iv ) of tfclusters considers significant clusters from step ( iii ) and threshold on their excess power @xmath18 , which is defined as @xmath90 for any given cluster @xmath91 of size @xmath67 .",
    "if no signal is present , i.e. if the cluster @xmath91 results from a fluctuation of the noise , the pdf of @xmath7 after the thresholding of step ( ii ) will be a truncated exponential for @xmath92 : @xmath93 the pdf of @xmath18 will be the convolution of @xmath67 such distributions , i.e. @xmath94 hence , setting a size - dependent threshold @xmath95 on @xmath18 , defined by the integral equation @xmath96 leads when only noise is present to the rejection of a fraction @xmath97 of the clusters that survived step ( iii ) , independently of the cluster size @xmath67 .",
    "step ( iv ) is very similar to the scheme used in the excess power algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the essential difference is that tfclusters chooses the pixels included in the computation of the excess power by using a threshold on the individual pixel power and a clustering analysis , while @xcite use a fixed set of `` masks '' of different shapes that are translated in the time - frequency plane , and over which the power for all pixels is integrated .",
    "the definition of these masks requires some prior expectations about the signal characteristics , and when this prior information is not sufficient to constrain the signal shapes to look for in the time - frequency plane , the selective approach of tfclusters is expected to become more efficient than the excess power approach of @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that other kinds of thresholds on the total cluster power could be used in step ( iv ) . while the one presented here",
    "penalizes in a similar fashion clusters of all sizes ( it reduces the false rate by @xmath97 independently of @xmath67 ) , a size independent threshold could also be used , for instance , in which case large clusters would be more likely to survive the last step of tfclusters .",
    "assessing the optimality of tfclusters in the modified neyman - pearson sense is a very involved mathematical task , as it can be inferred from similar problems treated in the literature @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is shown in this section that the algorithm presents interesting properties that suggest its near - optimality for a large class of signals .",
    "what will actually be discussed is a simplified version of the algorithm not involving the clustering analysis ( step ( iii ) of tfclusters ) .",
    "it is assumed that the clustering analysis will improve the performances of this detector when signals that form clusters in the time - frequency plane are indeed present .",

    "the idea behind tfclusters is that the _ ad hoc _ approach of merging the two - threshold scheme discussed above with a clustering analysis designed to effectively reject noise should lead to an efficient algorithm for such a signal subspace .",
    "on physical grounds , it can be expected for most transient sources that the pixels with excess power due to the signal will tend to cluster in the time - frequency domain .",
    "short signals like black hole ringdowns or mergers , for instance , have durations roughly of the order of the inverse of the usable interferometer bandwidths ( @xmath129 khz ) , and therefore appear as connected clusters of duration @xmath3 and bandwidth equal to the search bandwidth . for longer signals that spend tens or hundreds of cycles in the interferometers band , the required stability of the source is likely to necessitate that the dominating mechanism for the emission of the waves is governed by rotation , with the wave instantaneous frequency being around @xmath130 , for @xmath131 the magnitude of the angular momentum along the principal axis of rotation , and @xmath132 the moment of inertia of the source .",

    "the results from numerical simulations showed that this analysis was accurate in most situations : errors at the 1% level or better were obtained in `` ideal '' situations ( low cluster density , large number of frequency bins ) , and errors of the order of 10% appeared in situations were the analysis was expected to be less accurate , due to high order terms not included in the sums over the cluster configurations , or due to finite size effects from the limited bandwidth of the search . in the case where the errors were large , the analysis presented in this paper was systematically overestimating the false alarm rates ; should they prove from practical work to be necessary , more accurate estimates could therefore be obtained from more careful calculations , or from larger scale numerical simulations .",
    "while the false alarm properties of tfclusters are well - understood , the efficiency of the detector is subject to more uncertainties .",
    "a calculation that was presented in appendix [ narrow_band ] showed that the efficiency of tfclusters was comparable to that of the ideal power detector , unfortunately illustrating at the same time the mathematical complexity associated with producing such an estimate of the efficiency of the detector for a given signal .",
    "nevertheless , the fundamental approach used by tfclusters , namely the use of an adaptive power integral over pixels with excessive power , was shown to be maximizing asymptotically the estimate of the power in the signal , provided it is not overestimating it , over all possible estimators of the same quantity . this naturally suggests optimal properties for tfclusters as a detector .",
    "however , this can be nothing more than a conjecture at this point , as the actual proof of the optimality of tfclusters in the ( modified ) neyman - pearson sense is of great difficulty .    independently of the question of the optimality of tfclusters ,",
    "the structure of the algorithm is particularly practical for its implementation for the analysis of actual data . the first power threshold on individual pixels ( step ( ii ) )",
    "can be chosen to be frequency dependent in order to allow the analysis of colored gaussian noise when whitening of the data is not convenient ; the errors on the black pixel probability that are introduced by the non - zero correlations coloring the noise are generally negligible . moreover ,",
    "frequency bands containing spurious interferences are easily left out of the analysis , with minor modifications to the algorithm presented in this paper .",
