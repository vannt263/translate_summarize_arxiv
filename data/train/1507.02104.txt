    "we begin by recalling some notions from the freidlin - wentzell theory  @xcite of large deviations for the diffusion process  .",

    "we avoid considering such phenomena , and we shall rather establish our main result under the assumption that the quasipotential be smooth in the neighbourhood of the instanton . assuming that the quasipotential be smooth in a neighborhood of the instanton is not so restrictive , as this situation is thought of being generic , even in situations when lagrangian singularities do exists in some part of the phase space",
    ".    sections  [ s : stat ] and  [ s : bl ] are dedicated to the study of the quasistationary distribution of the diffusion process   in the neighbourhood of an attractor . in section",
    "[ s : stat ] , we compute the prefactor to the _ ensemble measure _ , that is , the nonequilibrium stationary distribution of a particle diffusing in a vector field with a single global attractor . at the logarithmic scale ,",
    "the freidlin - wentzell theory implies that the ensemble measure is equivalent to a gibbs measure with the quasipotential playing the role of the potential . using a classical wkb approach  @xcite ,",
    "we show that the transport equation satisfied by the prefactor to this logarithmic equivalent can be solved using the most probable fluctuation paths of the process as characteristics , or rays  @xcite , and thereby obtain an explicit expression for this prefactor which provides a correction taking into account the non - gibbsianness of the system along these fluctuation paths . in section  [",
    "s : bl ] , we fix a domain @xmath32 attracted to a single equilibrium point of the relaxation dynamics  , and perform a boundary layer analysis of the quasistationary distribution in @xmath33 to compute the associated probability current at some point @xmath34 . integrating this current over @xmath35 yields the rate @xmath36 at which a particle escapes from @xmath33 under the quasistationary distribution .    in the bistable situation",
    "described in subsection  [ ss : intro : metaneq ] , the irreversible ( or nonequilibrium ) eyring - kramers formula is finally derived in section  [ s : ek ] .",
    "in contrast with kramers method  @xcite , we do not apply a wkb approximation to the elliptic problem solved by the average transition time , but rather combine the results of section  [ s : bl ] with a purely probabilistic study of the diffusion process in the neighbourhood of the saddle - point , in order to compute the rate at which a particle started from @xmath10 reaches the neighbourhood of @xmath12 .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this irreversible eyring - kramers formula , @xmath38 has to be understood as the suitable definition of the hessian of the quasipotential at the saddle - point , so that the ratio of hessian determinants is a straightforward generalisation of the equilibrium case , with the quasipotential playing the role of the potential .",
    "besides , @xmath39 is the positive eigenvalue of the jacobian matrix @xmath40 , corresponding to the unstable direction of the vector field at the saddle - point .",
    "note that , in general , @xmath39 is not an eigenvalue of @xmath41 , so that it depends on the whole vector field @xmath31 and not only on its gradient part .",
    "the last correction with respect to the equilibrium eyring - kramers formula is the term involving the integral of the function @xmath42 along the instanton @xmath29 .",
    "this function @xmath42 arises from the prefactor to the quasistationary distribution , and has to be interpreted as a measure of the non - gibbsianness of the system , in the sense that @xmath43 if and only if the gibbs measure   is stationary for the process  .",
    "since our analysis is local , we expect this formula to extend to more general metastable situations , with more than two isolated attractors .",
    "let us precise that similar nonequilibrium formulas have already been derived , although as far as we know , our probabilistic approach is new and leads to the original formula  . in specific restricted cases , maier and",
    "stein  @xcite obtained a two - dimensional formula , while ariel and vanden - eijnden  @xcite addressed the case of irreversible diffusion processes preserving the invariance of the gibbs measure .",
    "based on a purely wkb analysis , schuss  @xcite obtained a preliminary version of   that does not explicitly involve the hessian matrix @xmath38 of the quasipotential at the saddle - point . besides , it seems to us that in none of these results , the nonequilibrium correction arising from the quasistationary behaviour was clearly identified in terms of the function @xmath42 and of the instanton .",
    "we finally underline that our analysis relies on the assumptions of local smoothness of the quasipotential around the instanton , and of nondegeneracy of the hessian matrix of the quasipotential at the saddle - point .",
    "we believe that these assumptions are generic .",
    "for instance , for generic vector fields @xmath31 , lagrangian singularities of the quasipotential do not occur along the instanton .",
    "these assumptions essentially lead to the existence of a transverse decomposition for the vector field @xmath31 , which somehow allows us to combine wkb approximations with notions from the theory of large deviations .",
    "in particular , the most probable fluctuation paths of the diffusion process are rather expressed in terms of this transverse decomposition than as the solution to the hamilton equations in a @xmath44-dimensional phase space , which is the point of view of most previous papers  @xcite where singularities of the quasipotential are addressed . as we shall discuss below , our assumptions",
    "in particular exclude some specific phenomena , such as the _ grazing instantons _ observed in  @xcite .      throughout this paper , the scalar product in @xmath0",

    "<S> the eyring - kramers formula classically provides a subexponential prefactor to this large deviation estimate . for irreversible diffusion processes , </S>",
    "<S> the equivalent of arrhenius law is given by the freidlin - wentzell theory . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper , we compute the associated prefactor and thereby generalise the eyring - kramers formula to irreversible diffusion processes . in our formula , the role of the potential is played by freidlin - wentzell s quasipotential , and a correction depending on the non - gibbsianness of the system along the instanton is highlighted . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis relies on a wkb analysis of the quasistationary distribution of the process in metastable regions , and on a probabilistic study of the process in the neighbourhood of saddle - points of the quasipotential . </S>"
