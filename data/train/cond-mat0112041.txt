    "the stress , or the energetic response to deformation or strain , plays an important role in linking the physical properties of a material ( e.g.  strength , toughness ) with the behavior of its microstructure .",
    "in addition , the spatial distribution of stress is an invaluable tool for continuum modeling of the response of materials .",
    "the stress concept has been applied at atomistic scales as well . over the last fifteen years , there has been a continuing trend toward understanding various structural and quantum - mechanical phenomena in materials in terms of their response to stress @xcite .",
    "for example , the residual stress at equilibrium has been used to assess the structural stability of systems containing surfaces or strained interfaces .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the desire to minimize surface stress can give rise to reconstructions on high symmetry surfaces @xcite , and the stability of epitaxially grown bimetallic systems has been attributed to the formation of incommensurate overlayers , defects , and dislocations which minimize the stress near the metal - metal interface @xcite .",
    "the stress can have significant effects on chemical reactivity as well .",
    "it has been shown that small molecule chemisorption energies and reaction barriers on certain strained metal and semiconductor surfaces are quite different from those on the corresponding unstrained surface @xcite .",
    "formally , studies of the above phenomena must include a quantum - mechanical description of the system s electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , one must consider how a stress is defined quantum mechanically .",
    "methods for calculating the stress in quantum mechanical systems have been developed since the birth of quantum theory @xcite .",
    "however , research in developing a formalism for determining the quantum stress in solid - state systems has recently been revitalized .",
    "this is mainly due to ever - increasing opportunities to perform accurate and efficient quantum - mechanical calculations on systems which exhibit stress mediated phenomena .",
    "the stress is a rank - two tensor quantity , usually taken to be symmetric and therefore torque - free",
    ". two useful representations of the stress tensor are the volume - averaged or total stress , @xmath0 , and the spatially varying stress field @xmath1 .",
    "the two representations are related , since the total stress for a particular region in a system is the stress field integrated over the volume .",
    "nielsen and martin developed a formalism for calculating the total quantum stress in periodic systems @xcite .",
    "they define the total stress as the variation of the total ground - state energy with respect to a uniform scaling of the entire system .",
    "this uniform scaling corresponds to a homogeneous or averaged strain over the entire system .",
    "they further demonstrate that the total quantum stress is a unique and well - defined physical quantity .",
    "their formulation has been successfully implemented to study a variety of solid state systems @xcite .",
    "other formalisms for determining the total quantum stress have been created as well @xcite .",
    "although these formalisms have provided important tools for studying quantum stress , the stress field is a more useful quantity that contains important information regarding the distribution of the stress throughout the system .",
    "a knowledge of the spatial dependence of the quantum stress is vital if one wishes to predict the spatial extent of structural modifications or understand phenomena at interfaces in complex heterogeneous systems .",
    "however , the quantum stress field can only be specified up to a so - called gauge term . therefore the quantum stress field is not unique . a traditional way to develop a quantum stress field formalism",
    "is to consider the stress field s relationship with the force field .",
    "from this perspective , the stress field can be defined as any rank - two tensor field whose divergence is the force field of the system : @xmath2 ( note that the einstein summation convention for repeated indices is used throughout the paper . ) one can add to @xmath3 a term of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is any tensor field antisymmetric in @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and recover the same force field , thereby demonstrating the non - uniqueness of this stress field definition .",
    "general formulations for computing stress fields in quantum many - body systems have been derived by nielsen and martin , folland , ziesche and co - workers , and godfrey @xcite .",
    "regardless of issues concerning non - uniqueness , the quantum stress field has been used to investigate material properties .",
    "for example , ramer and co - workers developed a method to calculate the resultant stress field from an induced homogeneous strain in order to study piezoelectric effects in perovskites @xcite .",
    "they incorporate the additional constraint that the field must be the smoothest fit to the ionic forces .",
    "however this method can not be used to calculate the residual stress field at equilibrium , nor can it determine the energy dependence on strains which do not have the periodicity of the unit cell .",
    "filippetti and fiorentini developed a formulation of the stress field based on the energy density formalism of chetty and martin @xcite .",
    "since this formulation is based explicitly on the energy density , which can not be uniquely specified , their stress field is also ambiguous .    in order to ascertain the exact nature of these ambiguities and to determine their effect on using the quantum stress field as an interpretive tool",
    ", we have developed a formulation of the quantum stress field based on differential geometry .",
    "this approach is similar to mistura s work in deriving pressure fields for classical inhomogeneous fluids @xcite .",
    "we first develop the necessary geometric framework and discuss the origin of ambiguities in the stress .",
    "we then derive the stress field in the context of local density functional theory ( lda - dft ) .",
    "finally , we apply our formulation by using the pressure field to explain the energetic ordering between two phases of solid molecular hydrogen .",
    "the geometric formulation for the stress field is developed from the relationship between a strain tensor field and the riemannian metric tensor field .",
    "this relationship has been derived for flat manifolds @xcite and for manifolds of arbitrary curvature @xcite .",
    "the infinitesimal squared distance between two points on a riemannian manifold can be written as @xmath8 where the metric @xmath9 is a rank two symmetric tensor field .",
    "the system can then be infinitesimally distorted so that the positions of the points change , @xmath10 which changes the squared distance to @xmath11 .",
    "however , a coordinate transformation can be made so that the new distance can be computed from the point of view of the predistorted positions : @xmath12 , with the new metric defined as @xmath13 the strain field @xmath14 can be related to the difference between distances before and after a distortion has been applied : @xmath15 .",
    "therefore the metric @xmath16 can be related to the strain : @xmath17    we define the stress field @xmath3 via the virtual work relationship between energy and strain @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the determinant of @xmath9 .",
    "using eq .",
    "[ strain - metric ] , the stress field can be expressed as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the inverse of the metric .",
    "it is this definition which we will use to compute the stress at the quantum length scale , with @xmath22 defined as the energy of the ground - state @xmath23 of a system described by a hamiltonian operator @xmath24 .",
    "this method of deriving the stress field is identical to that used to compute the `` improved '' energy - momentum tensor in field theories which are coupled to a background gravitational source @xcite .",
    "specifically , we shall be interested in the value of the stress field evaluated at the euclidean metric ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "for the virtual work theorem , ( and therefore eq .",
    "[ stress - metric ] ) , to specify a unique stress field , two criteria must be obeyed .",
    "first , the metric must be varied freely , without constraints , when computing the functional derivative .",
    "second the quantum - mechanical total energy must be unambiguously defined for all metrics .",
    "before we can explain the origin and the consequences of these criteria , we first must discuss in more detail the relationship between a metric tensor and the geometry of the underlying space containing the physical system .",
    "metric tensor fields , for our purposes , can be classified into two categories : those fields which cause the riemann curvature tensor to vanish at every point in space ( e.g. the euclidean metric @xmath26 ) , and those fields which give rise to a non - zero riemann curvature tensor ( e.g. the metric for the two - dimensional surface of a sphere ) .",
    "the latter class of metrics will be referred to as non - euclidean .",
    "the riemann curvature is a rank four tensor field defined as @xmath27 where the matrices @xmath28 are the christoffel symbols : @xmath29 metrics which give zero riemann curvature over the entire manifold are said to be flat .",
    "a coordinate transformation can always be performed so that any flat metric will transform into the euclidean metric over the entire manifold .",
    "we can think of the system as a collection of particles and/or fields embedded in a manifold @xmath30 diffeomorphic to @xmath31 .",
    "we will refer to @xmath30 as the background manifold .",
    "@xmath30 is a flat space and therefore the euclidean metric can be used to compute distances over the entire manifold .",
    "obviously any physically possible rearrangement is constrained to keep the particles embedded in @xmath30 ( assuming no gravitational field is present ) .",
    "therefore the system should only be able to realize strain configurations which correspond ( via the relation in eq .",
    "[ strain - metric ] ) to metric tensor fields which do not produce any riemann curvature , since @xmath30 is flat .",
    "this implies that the virtual work relation in eq .",
    "[ vwork ] should be rewritten to reflect this constraint .",
    "all flat metrics can be expressed as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a vector field continuous over the entire manifold .",
    "the constrained virtual work relation is then @xmath34 since we are now constrained to a flat space we can choose cartesian coordinates so that @xmath35 : @xmath36 notice that the divergence of the stress field has appeared in eq .",
    "[ newvwork ] , so this approach can not be used to uniquely specify the stress field . therefore introducing a constraint on variations in the metric ,",
    "has produced an ambiguity in the stress field .",
    "this is the origin of the aforementioned first criterion for uniqueness of the stress field . to have a unique stress field ,",
    "the system must be allowed to realize the energetics of _ any _ applied strain configuration which can be represented by a continuous symmetric tensor field .",
    "if we hypothesize that stress fields are unique , then we must explain physically how the system can be altered so that the riemann curvature at some point is non - zero .",
    "even a first order change away from the euclidean metric will generate a first order change in the curvature .",
    "one way which such distortions could be realized is by introducing a gravitational `` point - like '' source .",
    "then , according to general relativity , the system would be altered by the fact that the source has generated curvature within the background manifold .",
    "it is through this thought - experiment that the link between the definition of the stress field used in this work and the energy - momentum tensor in the gravitational literature is established .",
    "unfortunately this is not a phenomenon that can be observed by experiment , especially on the quantum scale .",
    "in addition to the gravitational interpretation , we can also consider the meaning of non - euclidean metrics within the context of the continuum theory of solids .",
    "in this theory , the solid within the limit of vanishing lattice parameter can be described by a vector field @xmath33 which indicates the displacement of atomic positions away from some reference ( usually taken to be a perfect crystal ) @xcite .",
    "if the specified atomic configuration contains defects such as disclinations and dislocations , then the displacement field @xmath33 will not be perfectly smooth and therefore will violate the integrability conditions : @xmath37 within linear elasticity theory , the information regarding the disclinations and dislocations can be represented by a symmetric tensor field known as the defect density @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the levi - civita symbol , and @xmath40 is the continuum strain tensor field . notice that @xmath41 is the double curl of the strain field .",
    "if @xmath42 over the entire manifold , then the strain field may be written in terms of the gradient of a displacement vector field @xmath33 which obeys the condition in eq .",
    "specifically , @xmath43 this is known as compatibility .",
    "if there are no defects present , then the strain field is compatible with a smooth vector displacement field .",
    "the defect density has a rigorous geometric meaning .",
    "it can be shown that @xcite @xmath44 @xmath45 is known as the einstein curvature tensor and is related to the riemann curvature through the ricci curvature @xmath46 and the scalar curvature @xmath47 .",
    "therefore if a particular strain configuration in a continuum model generates einstein curvature , it should be interpreted as a mathematical representation of the discontinuity in the displacement of the particles in the system due to defects .",
    "the curvature should not be thought of as a physical manipulation of the geometry of the background manifold .",
    "however , on the quantum scale , the relationship between the curvature and the compatibility of the strain field requires careful consideration .",
    "it is not obvious how to assign physical meaning to , for example , a `` defect '' that is point - like in an electron gas .",
    "since we must consider the energetic response of the system to non - euclidean metrics , the quantum - mechanical energy must be generalized so that it is unambiguously defined for metrics that generate an arbitrary riemann curvature .",
    "this is the origin of the second criterion for uniqueness of the quantum stress field .",
    "if we take the _ ab - initio _ perspective , we can build the generalized hamiltonian from only a few facts .",
    "first it is reasonable to require that the energy transform as a covariant scalar regardless of the geometry .",
    "second , the generalized hamiltonian must reduce to the known correct flat - space result when evaluated with a metric which generates zero riemann curvature .",
    "finally , the hamiltonian must be well - behaved in the sense that it corresponds to a quantum field theory that is renormalizable .",
    "unfortunately , these conditions are not strict enough to uniquely specify a single hamiltonian .",
    "there are an infinite number of possible choices , all which satisfy the above three conditions .",
    "in particular , the ambiguity manifests itself in the kinetic energy . in euclidean space ,",
    "the hamiltonian for a spin - zero free field @xmath48 is @xmath49 to generalize for a manifold of arbitrary curvature , we can write @xmath24 in a covariant form : @xmath50 the operator @xmath51 satisfies the aforementioned requirements for a generalized hamiltonian .",
    "notice @xmath51 could have been constructed by writing @xmath24 in terms of curvilinear coordinates in a flat space .",
    "this is known as the principle of least coupling .",
    "it is the simplest way to generate operators which are suitably generalized for curved spaces .",
    "also it is the mathematical formulation of the equivalence principle in general relativity .",
    "however , we could postulate another generalized form of @xmath24 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 are coupling constants to the various curvature terms .",
    "note that @xmath54 is a scalar and gives the correct euclidean space hamiltonian when @xmath26 .",
    "however the term multiplied by @xmath55 will cause the theory to be non - renormalizable in a curved space .",
    "this can be determined via dimensional analysis . in the units",
    "@xmath56 , @xmath57 ( commonly used in relativistic field theories @xcite ) the hamiltonian must have units of mass , or equivalently ( length)@xmath58 .",
    "this implies the integrand , or hamiltonian density , must have units of ( mass)@xmath59 since the measure @xmath60 has units of ( mass)@xmath61 .",
    "( the metric is unitless . )",
    "the spin - zero field @xmath48 has units of ( mass)@xmath62 , which can be deduced from the first term of @xmath63 which contains only gradients . the scalar curvature @xmath64 has units of ( mass)@xmath65 , since it contains the second derivatives and products of the first derivatives of the metric .",
    "hence we can conclude that @xmath66 has units of ( mass)@xmath65 , @xmath67 is dimensionless , and @xmath55 has units of ( mass)@xmath68 . if a coupling constant has negative mass dimension , then the theory is non - renormalizable @xcite .",
    "therefore we can set @xmath55 equal to zero .",
    "the ambiguity can be further reduced if we physically reason that if no matter is present in the system , then the stress field should be zero everywhere i.e. the part of @xmath63 multiplied by @xmath66 is a background term .",
    "furthermore , this term s contribution to the stress field will vanish when the stress field is evaluated at the euclidean metric .",
    "consequently we may set @xmath69 .",
    "however , we currently can not determine any restrictions on the value of @xmath67 from first principles .",
    "this is the origin of the ambiguity in the dependence of the energy on the metric .",
    "therefore the quantum stress field will only be unique up to the determination of @xmath67 .",
    "we further note that this problem is well - known in the gravitational and constrained - dynamics literature , and to date remains unresolved @xcite .",
    "we now use the geometric approach to derive the quantum stress field of a many - electron system in the presence of a fixed set of classical positive charged ions using local density functional theory @xcite .",
    "the ground state electronic charge density of the system is written as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 are single - particle orthonormal wavefunctions .",
    "for this derivation , we assume orbitals with fixed integer occupation numbers .",
    "the extension to metals with fermi fillings is straightforward , simply necessitating use of the mermin functional instead of the total energy @xcite .",
    "the total charge density of the system can be written as a sum over all ionic charges and @xmath72 : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the charge of the @xmath75-th ion located at position @xmath76 , and the presence of @xmath77 insures proper normalization of the delta function .",
    "the energy of the system can be written as the following constrained functional which is appropriately generalized for arbitrary riemannian spaces : @xmath78 here @xmath79 is the single particle kinetic energy including the aformentioned ambiguity , @xmath80 is the classical coulomb interaction between the total charge density and itself , and @xmath81 is the exchange - correlation energy of the electrons .",
    "the appearance of the last term in eq .",
    "[ totale ] is due to the orthonormality constraint of the orbitals .",
    "( we choose a unitary transformation on @xmath82 which enforces orthogonality . )",
    "one can express @xmath83 as an integral over an energy density @xcite .",
    "for convenience , we express the energy terms in eq .",
    "[ totale ] as the following : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the electric field due to the coulomb potential @xmath86 generated by @xmath87 , @xmath88 is the lda exchange - correlation energy density , and @xmath64 is the scalar curvature . to obtain the electronic ground - state energy ,",
    "we require @xmath89 with the additional constraints of a fixed metric ( @xmath90 ) and a fixed ionic charge density ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "this implies that the orbitals must obey the euler - lagrange equations @xmath92 which can be considered the kohn - sham equations for a general riemannian manifold .",
    "also , a least - action principle for @xmath80 requires that @xmath87 and @xmath86 obey the poisson equation : @xmath93    we now vary the total energy with respect to the metric .",
    "it can be proven that we do not need to consider variations in the electronic wavefunctions , charge density and potentials , since all such variations would vanish due to eq .",
    "[ e - l ] and eq.[poisson ] .",
    "this is the same principle used in the derivation of the hellmann - feynman force theorem and the energy - momentum tensor ( the variation of the action with respect to metric ) in general relativity @xcite .",

    "[ stressfield2 ] is most useful when evaluated at the euclidean metric .",
    "the @xmath98 are then solutions to the standard kohn - sham equations . from here on , we will refer to @xmath99 with an implied evaluation at the euclidean metric .    at this point",
    "we briefly describe how to obtain the explicit form of @xmath96 in euclidean space .",
    "we need to evaluate @xmath100 ( variations in @xmath72 are zero due to the aforementioned use of the variational principle . )",
    "keeping in mind we are only interested in the result evaluated for @xmath25 , and @xmath101 , the only non - zero term is @xmath102 after substantial manipulation and an integration by parts , we obtain @xmath103 plus additional terms which are zero when @xmath25 .",
    "explicit computation of the functional derivatives gives the final result for euclidean space : @xmath104    therefore , the complete stress field evaluated at @xmath25 is : @xmath105    it is important to note several key features of the form of @xmath99 .",
    "first the ambiguity in the kinetic stress is identical to that identified by godfrey via a different formalism@xcite .",
    "also , the kinetic stress contains diagonal terms which are similar to the symmetric and antisymmetric kinetic energy densities .",
    "the contribution of the exchange - correlation energy to the stress field is only in the diagonal ( pressure - like ) terms , which is the proper behavior for local density functionals @xcite and is identical to the exchange - correlation stress derived in ref .",
    "the coulombic contribution to @xmath99 is equivalent to the classical maxwell stress field .",
    "this coulombic term can be obtained by filippetti and fiorentini s formalism if one chooses the so - called maxwell gauge @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that it has been mathematically proven in the gravitational literature that the usual energy - momentum tensor for electromagnetism is unique @xcite .",
    "since this energy - momentum tensor is equivalent to the maxwell stress in the non - relativistic limit and the absence of magnetic fields , the classical coulombic interaction in the stress field is rigorously free of ambiguities .    by integrating the stress field over all space , note that we can obtain the total stress @xmath0 : @xmath106 which is identical to the expression derived by nielsen and martin@xcite .",
    "it is also instructive to consider the form of the pressure field @xmath107 defined as one - third the trace of the stress field . using our formulation for @xmath99",
    "we obtain : @xmath108 notice the pressure field contains the maxwell energy density and a combination of the symmetric and antisymmetric kinetic energy densities .",
    "the contribution of the lda exchange - correlation pressure is consistent with the unambiguous exchange - correlation energy density derived by burke and co - workers @xcite .    also present",
    "is the undetermined contribution of the laplacian of the charge density .",
    "we should consider whether this kinetic ambiguity impairs us from using the the pressure field to obtain novel qualitative information from total energy calculations .",
    "we would therefore need to determine a realistic range for the parameter @xmath67 .",
    "such a range can be derived if we consider the various forms of the kinetic energy density .",
    "symmetric and antisymmetric forms can be converted from one to the other by adding a term proportional to the laplacian of the charge density : @xmath109 hence a realistic range for @xmath67 in eq .",
    "[ pfield ] would be from 0 to 1/8 .",
    "in order to demonstrate the utility of our stress field formalism , we compute within dft the pressure field , for two phases of solid molecular hydrogen under external hydrostatic pressure of 50 gpa .",
    "both structures consist of stacked two - dimensional triangular lattices of hydrogen molecules , with the molecular axis parallel to the stacking direction and a repeat unit of two layers .",
    "m_-hcp structure has alternating layers shifted so that each hydrogen molecule is directly above triangular hollow sites in the neighboring layers .",
    "the second structure ( belonging to the _ cmca _ space group ) has a different shift , so that each molecule lies directly above midpoints between nearest - neighbor pairs of molecules in adjacent layers @xcite .",
    "the energetics and electronic properties of both structures have been studied extensively from first principles @xcite .",
    "examination of the pressure field permits us to rationalize the energy ordering of these structures .",
    "m_-hcp structure is energetically favored by 60 mev / molecule .",
    "figure [ fig1]a shows a contour plot of the pressure field for the _ cmca _ structure . here we have set the constant @xmath67 equal to zero .",
    "the pressure is tensile ( greater than zero ) through the interstitial region , indicating that contraction is locally favorable .",
    "the tensile pressure is greatest in the volume directly above and below each molecule , averaging 3 ev / @xmath110 .",
    "this implies that the system would energetically favor increased intermolecular coordination . in figure",
    "[ fig1]b we show a similar plot for the _ m_-hcp structure . again",
    "the pressure within the interstitial region is tensile .",
    "however , the pressure field has significantly rearranged , and the pressures in the regions above and below molecules have been reduced to approximately 2.25 ev / @xmath110 . it is also clear from the charge density plots ( figure [ fig1]c and [ fig1]d ) that the reduction in pressure is correlated with an increase in bonding between molecules and increased charge delocalization .",
    "the pressure fields within the molecules are compressive , and they are several orders of magnitude larger than the interstitial features . however , because these large fields are very similar in both structural phases ( and the free molecule ) , they are not important for understanding relative phase stability .",
    "thus , changes in the pressure stress field highlight regions and charge density features that contribute to favorable energetic changes .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] contrasts the pressure fields for @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "note that there is no qualitative change in the pressure field within the interstitial regions since the charge density in this area is quite smooth and hence the value of its laplacian is small ( averaging 0.05  ev / @xmath110 ) .",
    "therefore our above analysis holds regardless of our choice of @xmath67 .",
    "we have developed a new formulation of the quantum stress field using differential geometry .",
    "we identify the stress tensor field as a variation of the total ground state quantum - mechanical energy with respect to the metric tensor field . within this formulation",
    "we have uniquely specified the stress field up to a single ambiguity .",
    "the origin of the ambiguity lies in the inability to uniquely describe the dependence of the kinetic energy on the metric tensor .",
    "we have successfully extended this formulation to local density functional theory .",
    "terms identical to the maxwell stress can be found within the lda - dft stress field .",
    "we note that within the gravitational literature , it is well - known that the maxwell stress is unique .",
    "we describe the similarities between the pressure field obtained by our method and the various terms found in the total energy density .",
    "we then show that the pressure field contains an ambiguity in the form of the laplacian of the charge density multiplied by a constant @xmath67 . through the relationship between terms in the pressure field and the kinetic energy density",
    "we offer a realistic range of choices for the value of @xmath67 .",
    "to demonstrate the usefulness of stress field as a qualitative tool in combination with total energy calculations , we used the pressure field to rationalize the energetics of two phases of solid molecular hydrogen .",
    "we finally show that our conclusions remain invariant with respect to realistic choices of @xmath67 .",

    "choosing @xmath113 dimensionless is equivalent to measuring distance and time with the same units , giving energy and mass the same units .",

    "the feynman diagrams involve integrals over all momentum ( or mass ) .",
    "dimensional analysis implies that the dependence of the coupling constant on mass is inversely related to that of the integrand as a whole .",
    "therefore , if the coupling constant depends inversely on the mass , the integrand will contain positive powers of the mass , and higher perturbative orders will diverge increasingly rapidly . this leads to new divergences at each order and a non - renormalizable theory . since each divergent term needs to be absorbed into an experimentally measured quantity , non - renormalizable theories have limited predictive power and are not accepted as valid models of nature .",
