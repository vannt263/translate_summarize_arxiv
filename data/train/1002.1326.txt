    "in the light of the present knowledge of elementary particle physics phenomenology , leptogenesis appears as one of the most plausible explanations for the dynamical emergence of the baryon asymmetry of the universe  @xcite .",
    "leptogenesis in turn is a variant of baryogenesis from out - of - equilibrium decays of heavy particles during the expansion and cooling of the early universe  @xcite .",
    "the deviation from equilibrium provides the breaking of time reversal invariance , that is a necessary condition for baryogenesis  @xcite as a consequence of the @xmath0 theorem .",
    "the most common approach for making quantitative predictions is to formulate and solve a network of boltzmann equations , that describes the evolution of the number densities of the particle species relevant to baryogenesis . in simple scenarios for leptogenesis ,",
    "a setup that leads to meaningful results is to compute the distribution function of a heavy right - handed majorana neutrino @xmath2 and of the charge density of a lepton doublet @xmath3 , while one may assume that the remaining species are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "more realistic models typically take account of the presence of the several generations .",
    "the boltzmann equations are usually written in a form , where on the left hand side , there is a kinetic term that traces the particle number distributions , while on the right hand side , there is a collision term .",
    "the collision term accounts for elastic and inelastic ( particle number violating ) scatterings .",
    "it arises from weighting reaction rates , computed in vacuum scattering theory ( in - out formalism ) , with the distribution functions of the species involved .",
    "when setting up the boltzmann equations , one encounters the following issue : let @xmath4 , the rate for the decay process @xmath5 , be proportional to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 parametrises the @xmath1 asymmetry of the decay .",
    "then , by complex conjugation of the involved coupling constants , it follows that @xmath8 .",
    "application of the @xmath0 theorem then implies that the inverse decay rates @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "if these were the only contributions that are accounted for in the collision term , one might conclude that the two - by - two rate @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath12 , while the rate of @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "an asymmetry even in equilibrium would result , in apparent contradiction with @xmath0 invariance .",
    "but of course , there is no contradiction , since the heavy neutrinos are unstable and therefore do not belong to the hilbert space of asymptotic states of a unitary @xmath15-matrix .",
    "the total lepton number violating two - by - two rates are therefore not given by the above naive multiplication of the rates for decay and inverse decay .",
    "yet , it is crucial that one tracks the neutrino densities in the boltzmann equations .",
    "the issue is fixed when realising that the resonant parts of the two - by - two scatterings , where the intermediate neutrino is on - shell , contribute to the boltzmann equations at the same order in coupling constants as the decay and inverse decay processes .",
    "technically , one adds the full two - by - two rates and subtracts from these the on - shell contribution , since this is already accounted for in the decays and inverse decays  @xcite .",
    "this procedure is known as the subtraction of real intermediate states ( ris ) .",
    "one expects that the ris subtraction is naturally realised within a first principle approach , that is less heuristic than the boltzmann ansatz .",
    "this first principle approach is given by applying the schwinger - keldysh closed time path ( ctp ) formalism  @xcite to field theory  @xcite . in this paper , we derive and solve the kadanoff - baym equations for leptogenesis , that result from the ctp formalism .",
    "we pay particular attention to demonstrating that no lepton asymmetry is generated in equilibrium , or , more generally in situations that are time - reversal invariant . for models with fermionic leptons this result",
    "has been reported earlier in works based on the ctp formalism  @xcite , though no detailed derivation has been given .",
    "( the main focus of refs .",
    "@xcite is the study of memory effects . ) for the case of scalar leptons , the vanishing of the asymmetry in equilibrium has been demonstrated recently in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition to offering the framework for a first - principle derivation of equations that describe leptogenesis , the ctp formalism also provides finite density corrections that do not straightforwardly follow in the boltzmann approach .",
    "these corrections take the form of an integral over terms linear in the higgs boson and lepton distribution functions .",
    "historically , it has been proposed to compute the @xmath1 asymmetry from the discontinuity of the correlation functions in the matsubara ( imaginary time ) formalism . in the ctp ( real time )",
    "approach , this corresponds to the imaginary part of the time - ordered correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "it is characteristic of these green functions , that they feature not only terms that are linear in the lepton and higgs boson distribution functions , but also a product term of these distributions .",
    "in contrast , it appears to be the consensus among the more recent papers  @xcite that the @xmath1 asymmetry does not receive corrections from a product term of higgs boson and lepton distribution functions .",
    "this has been shown in detail for the model with scalar leptons in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we find the same property in the model with fermionic leptons : the @xmath1 asymmetry results from terms that can be written as the difference of wightman type correlators ( no explicit time - ordering of the field operators ) .",
    "after deriving the kinetic equation for the lepton asymmetry in the ctp formalism we solve it numerically in various situations .",
    "we find that the effect of the new quantum statistical corrections is small when the bulk of the lepton asymmetry is produced at temperatures @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mass of the neutrino that decays out of equilibrium , because the distribution functions are strongly boltzmann suppressed for momenta much large than @xmath18 .",
    "this situation corresponds to the strong - washout scenario , which is of particular interest since the resulting asymmetry is independent of both , the initial abundance of heavy neutrinos and a possible primordial lepton asymmetry . on the other hand , when the bulk of the asymmetry is produced for @xmath19 or larger , which corresponds to weak washout , the impact is more sizable . for a vanishing initial lepton asymmetry and thermal initial conditions of @xmath2",
    ", we find an enhancement of the asymmetry , as apparently the bose enhancement from the higgs particle distribution function dominates over the fermi suppression from the lepton distribution .",
    "this qualitatively confirms what has been reported for scalar leptons  @xcite . in this context",
    ", we note that the effects of finite density have been considered when the quantum statistical factors are accounted for in the initial and final states  @xcite , but not in the loop corrections , in which case it has also been found that the corrections may be sizable in the weak - washout regime . however , the quantum statistical factors in the loop corrections appear within the ctp approach on the same footing and with the same size as the external state factors , which is why they can not be neglected consistently .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows : in section  [ section : ctp ] , we specify the model , introduce the free ctp propagators and provide the one - loop self energies .",
    "these ingredients are used in section  [ section : tree : level ] to derive the kadanoff - baym equations that correspond to the tree - level boltzmann equations with quantum statistical factors .",
    "the wave - function correction that leads to a @xmath1 asymmetry arises from a two - loop diagram in the ctp formalism , which we discuss in section  [ section : wf ] .",
    "we explicitly show that no asymmetry is produced in equilibrium and we relate this fact to the usual procedure of ris subtraction .",
    "similarly , we discuss the vertex correction in section  [ section : vertex ] . in section",
    "[ section : numerics ] , we numerically evaluate the effective @xmath1-violating parameter and solve the boltzmann equations for different strengths of washout , which demonstrates that finite density corrections are important for weak washout , but may be neglected in the strong - washout domain .",
    "we conclude in section  [ section : conclusions ] .",
    "in the simplest scenario of leptogenesis , there are two right handed neutrinos @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) with lepton - number violating majorana masses @xmath22 , one scalar su(2 ) higgs doublet @xmath23 and an active left - handed lepton doublet @xmath3 .",
    "the lagrangian of the model is @xmath24 where a summation over @xmath21 is understood and @xmath25 . besides , it is implicitly assumed that the @xmath26 indices are contracted in a gauge - invariant way , that is @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes the antisymmetric @xmath30 matrix with @xmath31 . upon the four - component spinor @xmath32",
    ", we impose the majorana constraint @xmath33 with @xmath34 the charge conjugation matrix .      for the ctp formalism",
    "we follow closely the notational conventions of refs .",
    "@xcite and define the ctp propagators for the leptons by    @xmath35    we perform a perturbation and gradient expansion of the full kadanoff - baym equations that uses the tree - level propagators and vertices as elementary building blocks .",
    "the tree - level propagators are therefore given by the vacuum propagators plus a finite - density contribution proportional to the spectral function of the free theory .",
    "when there are no correlations between modes of different momentum and spin , we can characterize the state by particle number distribution functions . in case",
    "there is also no preferred direction for the spin , the usual averaging procedure applies .",

    "the results extend existing approaches since all quantum statistical factors are accounted for systematically for the first time in a realistic model of leptogenesis .",
    "we have put particular emphasis on establishing a connection to the conventional boltzmann approach and elucidated how ris subtraction is realised in the ctp formalism .",
    "the numerical analysis shows that finite density corrections do not play a significant role in the strong - washout regime while they may have a sizable impact in weak - washout scenarios .",
    "the detailed analysis of the simple model of leptogenesis presented in this work should be seen as a first step toward applications of the ctp formalism to situations where the boltzmann framework needs to be modified .",
    "one may think of flavour effects  @xcite , the inclusion of additional thermal effects  @xcite or resonant leptogenesis  @xcite in the limit of degenerate right - handed neutrino masses .",
    "examples of approaches to these more advanced problems using the ctp formalism may already be found the literature  @xcite .",
    "however , so far there has been no complete derivation and solution of the equations describing the standard scenario of leptogenesis within the ctp framework .",
    "the present work may be viewed as a self - consistent leading - order approximation in this framework , which serves as a starting point for investigating further corrections and variations .      while this paper was in writing , ref .",
    "@xcite appeared which also studies modifications of an effective @xmath1-violating parameter in a realistic leptogenesis model due to finite - density effects in loops .",
