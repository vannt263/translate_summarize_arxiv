    "the casimir force  @xcite between a pair of parallel , perfectly reflecting plates is remarkable prediction of quantum electrodynamics which has been confirmed by experiment  @xcite .",
    "it also has some implications for the semiclassical theory of gravity , as the stress tensor of the casimir energy violates the weak energy condition . simply from casimir",
    "s result for the force per unit area , one can construct the entire stress tensor , using conservation , tracelessness and symmetry arguments  @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath0 here the plates are separated by a distance @xmath1 in the @xmath2-direction , and units where @xmath3 are used . here",
    "@xmath4 is understood to be a renormalized expectation value of the quantum stress tensor operator .    because the local energy density is negative",
    ", the weak energy condition is violated .",
    "in addition , the null energy condition , @xmath5 for all null vectors @xmath6 is violated as well , except for the case where @xmath6 is parallel to the plates , in which case @xmath7 .",
    "the null energy condition is the condition for gravity to locally focus a bundle of null rays .",
    "the average null energy condition , @xmath8 along a complete null geodesic , is more difficult to violate  @xcite .",
    "null rays which are not parallel to the plates eventually intersect and pass through the plates .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : anec ] ) then gets a contribution from the matter composing the plates . the extent to which quantum fields could violate the average null energy condition is of interest in several aspects of gravity theory . its violation , for example , is essential to construct traversable wormholes  @xcite .",
    "some authors  @xcite have suggested that when the assumption of perfect conductivity is removed , the negative energy density might disappear .",
    "however , in a previous paper  @xcite , we calculated the energy density between two half - spaces filled with dispersive material , and showed that the energy density in the center can still be negative .",
    "however , the energy density is no longer constant in the region between the interfaces , and diverges positively at the boundaries .",
    "this divergence , which arises despite a dispersive dielectric function which approaches one at high frequency , can be attributed to the assumption of a sharp boundary between the dielectric and vacuum regions .",
    "it may come as a surprize that the energy density is finite between perfectly reflecting plates , but diverges near plates of finite reflectivity .",
    "however , in the perfectly reflecting case there is a cancellation between two divergent terms .",
    "both the mean squared electric field , @xmath9 , and mean squared magnetic field , @xmath10 , diverge but the energy density is finite .",
    "when the plates have finite reflectivity , both @xmath9 and @xmath10 diverge less rapidly than in the perfectly reflecting case , but the cancellation is upset , so that the energy density also diverges near the plates .",
    "there are more complicated geometries where similar cancellation can occur . in the interior of a wedge with perfecty reflecting walls , the energy density diverges near the corner , but is finite if one approaches either wall away from the corner  @xcite .",
    "again there must be a cancellation which would be upset if the wall had finite reflectivity .    in the present paper",
    ", we will extend the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to study the pressure components of the stress tensor and the effects of finite temperature . as before ,",
    "our calculations are based on a formalism developed by schwinger , deraad , and milton@xcite .",
    "lorentz - heaviside units with @xmath3 will be used .",
    "we consider the electromagnetic field stress tensor in the vacuum region of width @xmath1  between two dielectric half - spaces whose dielectric function is described by the plasma model : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the plasma frequency .",

    "the overall sign of @xmath26 at its minimum depends on the choice of @xmath1 and @xmath12 .",
    "as the product @xmath27 grows , @xmath26 at the midpoint decreases , becoming negative for @xmath28 ( see figure 2 , dash - dot line ) .",
    "it is of interest to examine the effects due to finite temperature upon the energy density and see when its sign can still be negative when the temperature is not zero .    for this purpose ,",
    "we write eq .",

    "the prime on the sum is a reminder to count the @xmath31 term with half weight , and @xmath32 .",
    "this expression ( which vanishes  as @xmath33 ) represents the casimir contribution to the energy density , or the difference between the energy density at finite temperature with the dielectric walls present and not .",
    "it does not include the energy density of a thermal bath without the walls present . to get the latter energy density",
    ", we can start with the full expression for @xmath26 , which includes the empty space vacuum divergent term @xcite . at zero temperature",
    ", this term can be written as an integral over real frequencies : @xmath34 where @xmath16 is defined as @xmath35 . for finite temperatures ,",
    "this term is modified by inserting a factor @xmath36 $ ] to account for the thermal energy .",
    "this factor reflects the fact that at zero temperature , each mode has an energy of @xmath37 ; at finite temperature , there is an additional thermal energy of @xmath38 . after removing the divergent term",
    ", the result is the familiar result for the energy density of blackbody radiation :    @xmath39    the energy density in the vacuum region at finite temperature is then@xmath40    [ ptb ]    ub5200.eps    figure  [ fig : ub ] shows two graphs representing energy density at zero and finite temperature corresponding to @xmath41 .",
    "as expected , the local energy density increases with temperature , and negative energy density is only possible if the temperature is sufficiently low . on the other hand ,",
    "the zero temperature results are a good approximation so long as @xmath42 . for systems at room temperature ,",
    "this increase in the energy density is still very small when the separations between the walls are of the order of few micrometers .",
    "more generally , one can ignore thermal effects at distances small compared to @xmath43 . in this case",
    ", it is still possible to achieve negative energy density in the central region . at room temperature , for example , @xmath44 .",
    "thus , @xmath41 corresponds to @xmath45 , which is in the range of separations for which casimir force experiments have been performed .",

    "if we compare the position dependent term in @xmath26 , eq .  ( [ eq : u ] ) , with that in @xmath59 , eq.([eq : px ] ) , we see that they differ by a factor of two .",
    "these terms are dominant near a wall , so the asymptotic form of @xmath59 near the boundary @xmath60 is one half the corresponding expression for @xmath26 in this limit , which was found in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath61 again , this singular behavior arises despite the inclusion of dispersion in our treatment , and can be viewed as due to the assumption of a sharp boundary at @xmath62 .",
    "a crucial point is that the reflection coefficients vanish as @xmath63 as @xmath64 . pfenning  @xcite has studied scalar models in which these coefficients vanish more rapidly at high frequency , and obtained a finite stress tensor at the boundary .",
    "now we turn to the null energy condition for rays travelling parallel to the walls . combining eqs .",

    "we now wish to show that in all other cases , @xmath72 .",
    "first consider the terms proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "of these , the term proportional to @xmath74 vanishes because @xmath22 is independent of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "next consider the term proportional to @xmath73 and to @xmath77 .",

    "thus , @xmath81 now consider the term in eq .",

    "we can write @xmath83 from which we see that @xmath84 .",
    "we can also show that @xmath85 for @xmath86 , from which it follows that @xmath87 .",
    "this implies that the @xmath82 term in eq .",
    "( [ null ] ) is non - negative .",
    "thus @xmath88 , and the null energy condition is satisfied by a finite margin , except for the limiting case of a perfect conductor .",
    "this implies that the gravitational effect on light rays moving parallel to the plates is to cause focusing . even though the energy density can be negative , its effect is more than cancelled by the positive pressure",
    ".    now we inspect the effect of the finite temperature on the null energy condition .",
    "we expect that finite temperature would make the null energy condition satisfied by a wider margin .",
