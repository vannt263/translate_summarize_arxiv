    "the behaviour of the proton structure function @xmath5 at small @xmath1 reflects the behaviour of the gluon distribution , since the gluon is by far the dominant parton in this regime .",
    "perturbative qcd does not predict the absolute value of the parton distributions , but rather determines how they vary from a given input .",
    "if , for example , we are given initial distributions at some scale @xmath6 , then the dglap @xcite evolution equations enable us to determine the distributions at higher @xmath7 .",
    "dglap evolution resums the leading @xmath8 terms . at sufficiently high electron - proton centre - of - mass energy @xmath9",
    "we encounter a second large variable to be the bjorken variable @xmath10 where @xmath11 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the four momenta of the proton and virtual photon deep inelastic probe respectively . ]",
    "@xmath14 , and we must resum the leading @xmath15 contributions . at leading order the resummation",
    "is accomplished by the bfkl equation @xcite for the ( unintegrated ) gluon distribution .",
    "the solution of the equation leads to a singular @xmath16 small @xmath1 behaviour of the gluon distribution , where @xmath17 for fixed @xmath18 and @xmath19 if a reasonable prescription for the running of @xmath18 is assumed and for the treatment of the infrared region @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 behaviour of the bfkl gluon feeds through , via the @xmath20-factorization theorem @xcite , into the small @xmath1 behaviour of the structure function @xmath21 .",
    "of course in practice we should not expect such a dramatic growth with decreasing @xmath1 , since subleading effects are expected to suppress the effective value of @xmath22 in the hera domain @xcite .    however , it is difficult to identify the presence of the @xmath23 terms in the measurements of @xmath21 at hera even though the data do show a steep rise with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "in fact the rise in the latest precise h1 and zeus measurements @xcite can be well described by next - to - leading order dglap evolution down to @xmath24 gev@xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the problem in identifying the underlying small @xmath1 dynamics is due to the parametric freedom that we have in specifying the initial parton distributions .",
    "for instance for a non - singular gluon input we can increase the steepness of @xmath21 with decreasing @xmath1 by simply reducing @xmath6 and increasing the dglap evolution length , @xmath27 .",
    "alternatively , we could use ( as in the global parton analyses @xcite ) a singular input form @xmath28 , with @xmath22 chosen to fit the data .",
    "we conclude that it is difficult to isolate @xmath29 effects from measurements of @xmath21 .",
    "the observable @xmath21 is too inclusive .",
    "rather , we should explore properties of the final state in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "the classic way @xcite to probe the small @xmath1 behaviour of qcd , which avoids the problem of assuming input parton distributions , is to study deep inelastic @xmath30 events which contain an identified forward jet @xmath31 , see fig .",
    "according to bfkl dynamics the differential structure function for dis + jet events has the following small @xmath32 behaviour @xmath33   \\left(\\frac{x}{x_{j}}\\right)^{-\\lambda } , \\label{eq : a1}\\ ] ] where the normalisation coefficient @xmath34 is given in refs .",
    "the parton distributions @xmath35 , @xmath13 and @xmath36 are to be evaluated at @xmath37 .",
    "the relevant kinematic region is where    * the jet transverse momentum satisfies @xmath38 so as to neutralize the dglap evolution , and is sufficiently large so as to suppress diffusion into the infrared region when we solve the bfkl equation at decreasing values of @xmath39 ; * the jet longitudinal momentum @xmath40 is as large as is experimentally feasible ( and @xmath1 is as small as possible ) so as to be able to probe the region of small @xmath39 .    for these values of @xmath41 the parton distributions entering ( [ eq : a1 ] )",
    "are well known from the global parton analyses and so the observation of dis + jet events offers the opportunity to expose bfkl - type small @xmath1 dynamics free from the ambiguities associated with the choice of the non - perturbative parton input .",
    "in other words we are studying small @xmath1 dynamics by deep inelastic scattering off a known parton , rather than off the proton .",
    "experimentally , however , the clean identification and kinematic measurement of a forward jet proves to be difficult since we require it to be as close to the proton remnants as possible , that is @xmath41 as large as possible .",
    "nevertheless experimental studies have been attempted and lead to encouraging results @xcite .",
    "here we use the improved knowledge of the fragmentation functions to propose that the forward jet is identified through the measurement of a single energetic decay product .",
    "as it turns out the @xmath0 is the hadron which can be identified in the most forward direction in the detectors at hera .",
    "we use the bfkl formalism to predict the dis + forward @xmath0 rate .",
    "the rate will , of course , be suppressed in comparison with the dis + forward jet rate and it is an experimental issue to see if the advantages of single particle detection as compared to identification of the ( parent ) jet can compensate for the loss of signal .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the qcd formalism required to calculate the cross section for the deep inelastic + forward @xmath42 process .",
    "then in section 3 we discuss the experimental cuts which we impose and give our numerical predictions for the dis + @xmath42 cross section .",

    "first we recall the derivation of the cross section for the deep inelastic + jet process depicted in fig .",

    "we predict the cross section for dis + jet production from equations ( [ eq : a2 ] ) and ( [ eq : a3 ] ) .",
    "next let us consider the process where the forward jet fragments into @xmath0 s as shown schematically in fig .",

    "the functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 in ( [ eq : a14 ] ) give the probability that a gluon or quark jet fragments into a @xmath42 carrying a fraction @xmath53 of the parent jet s momentum .",
    "we assume that these fragmentation functions satisfy leading order dglap evolution equations .",
    "note that su(2 ) isospin symmetry implies that @xmath91 for all partons @xmath92 . therefore ( [ eq : a14 ] ) describes the average of the cross sections for @xmath93 and @xmath94 production .",
    "we use the parametrizations of the leading order charged pion fragmentation functions obtained by binnewies et al .",
    "@xcite ; their analysis treated light , s , c , and b quarks independently for the first time .",
    "we use ( [ eq : a14 ] ) to calculate the event rate for deep inelastic scattering in which , in addition to the scattered electron , the @xmath0 is measured in the final state . to ensure that the @xmath0 is really a fragment of the forward jet ( and",
    "does not come from the quark - antiquark pair which form the quark box ) we require the @xmath0 to be emitted in the forward hemisphere in the virtual photon - proton centre - of - mass frame .",
    "if we express the pion four momentum in terms of sudakov variables @xmath95 then the forward hemisphere requirement is @xmath96 since the outgoing pion satisfies the on - mass - shell condition @xmath97 we have @xmath98 then ( [ eq : a17 ] ) gives @xmath99 we thus have an implicit lower limit on the @xmath41 integration in ( [ eq : a14 ] ) , which is generally stronger than the condition @xmath100 imposed on the solution of the bfkl equation .",
    "another problem to be taken into account is that at hera pions can only be detected if they are emitted at a large enough angle to the proton beam .",
    "this also ensures that there is no contamination from pions produced in the proton remnant .",
    "we require @xmath101 in fig .",
    "2 we show the relation between the pion kinematic variables for different choices of the minimum angle @xmath102 defined in the hera frame . we find that pions with large longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath76 are only emitted at small angles @xmath103 . to reach larger @xmath76 for a given @xmath103 we can measure pions with larger @xmath104 but at a depleted event rate . in the same figure we also plot the boundary given by the hemisphere cut , ( [ eq : a17 ] ) , for @xmath105 and @xmath106 gev@xmath25 , which acts as a lower limit on the allowed kinematic region . we will use @xmath107 for the main presentation of our results ( although later we compare the predictions with those obtained with @xmath108 ) .",
    "now we are in the position to give numerical predictions for the cross section for the dis + @xmath42 production using ( [ eq : a14 ] ) and implementing the cuts that we just discussed .",
    "recall that it follows from ( [ eq : a15 ] ) that the cross section for @xmath0 production equals the average of the cross sections for @xmath93 and @xmath94 production .",
    "therefore the results we will show in the following multiplied by a factor of 2 will be valid for charged pion production . throughout the analysis we assumed three flavours of massless quarks . in fig .",
    "3 we plot the @xmath1 dependence of this cross section integrated over bins of size @xmath109 and @xmath110 gev@xmath25 for three different @xmath111 bins , namely 20 - 30 , 30 - 40 , 40 - 50 gev@xmath25 . here we required that @xmath112 and @xmath113 gev and used the fragmentation functions @xcite at scale @xmath104 .",
    "we compare the results obtained when bfkl small @xmath1 resummation is included with the case when gluon radiation is neglected . in the first case the strong @xmath1 dependence of the cross section",
    "is driven by the small @xmath53 behaviour of the @xmath114 and therefore there is a strong enhanced increase with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "for example , if we compare the cross section for @xmath115 in the two cases , we find that the results are about a factor 7 larger when the bkfl resummation is included than when it is neglected .",
    "this enhancement is the signature of bfkl soft gluon resummation .",
    "in fact the bfkl behaviour should be identified via the shape in @xmath1 rather than the value of the cross section , since the latter is subject to normalisation uncertainties @xcite . in fig .",
    "4 we show the cross section ( in fb ) , for the same cuts as in fig .  3 , in various bins in @xmath1 and @xmath111 which are accessible at hera .",
    "we find that the cross section drops off very rapidly with @xmath7 which means that we can reach the highest values for the bins with @xmath116 gev@xmath25 and @xmath1 very small .",
    "of course the dis + @xmath42 cross section depends on the values chosen for the cuts . in table 1",
    "we show the effect of changing the limits on the @xmath117 integration .",
    "since the cross section decreases with increasing @xmath117 it is more sensitive to the lower limit on the @xmath117 integration than to the upper limit .",
    "dis + @xmath42 cross section in the bin @xmath118 , @xmath119 gev@xmath25 as calculated in fig .  4 , but for different choices of the limits of the integration over the transverse momentum of the @xmath42 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in principle , the dis + jet measurement should be an excellent way of identifying the bfkl soft gluon resummation effects at hera .",
    "it turns out , however , that it is experimentally quite difficult to measure a forward jet so close to the proton remnants .",
    "we therefore suggested studying the fragmentation of this forward jet into a single energetic decay product , the @xmath42 .",
    "this should be easier to measure .",
    "( the dis + @xmath0 signal can , of course , be supplemented by also observing jet fragmentation into @xmath120 mesons ) .",
    "we found that when we include bfkl dynamics in the calculation of the cross section it leads to the characteristic steep rise with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "the disadvantage of using the dis + @xmath121 process is that the event rate is lower than for dis + forward jet .",
    "we quantified the suppression which arises from this jet to @xmath121 fragmentation ( see also footnote 2 ) .",
    "it is an experimental question as to whether the loss of event rate can be compensated by the more forward domain accessible for @xmath121 detection and the more accurate measurement of the kinematic variables possible for pions as opposed to jets .",
    "we presented sample results for different acceptance cuts to help provide an answer .",
    "since @xmath0 s are measured via the two photon decay , there is a background to the deep - inelastic + @xmath42 measurement from events in which the parent jet fragments into a photon which is being emitted collinearly to the jet .",
    "we found that this background is about 1 - 2 % .",
