    "diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dmss ) are semiconductors in which a fraction of the cations is substituted with transition metal ions , e.g. , mn or fe",
    ". different types of dmss comprising iii - v , ii - vi , and iv - vi materials exhibit a diversity of unique magnetic , optical and conductive properties attractive from the point of view of fundamental research as well as possible applications . the @xmath0 interaction between band carriers and localized magnetic moments in",
    "dms leads to such effects as giant zeeman splitting of bands or giant magneto - resistance , both beneficial for the domain of information processing and storage .",
    "gan based dmss are particularly appealing in the view of possible practical implementations , as they are expected to exhibit a ferromagnetic ordering of spins with a critical curie temperature exceeding room temperature @xcite .",
    "as it was shown @xcite a correlation of magneto - optical and magnetic properties is an essential condition for the unequivocal assessment of the intrinsic nature of magnetization of dms .",
    "the magneto - optical kerr effect ( moke ) @xcite is a commonly used optical tool for a determination of the dms magnetization .",
    "its magnitude scales typically linearly with the zeeman splitting of excitonic levels which is in turn linearly proportional to the sample magnetization @xcite .",
    "however , the magneto - optical signal from dms decreases at a very low and a very high magnetic ions doping level . in the first case it is due to a low magnitude of the zeeman splitting , while in the latter one , due to the decrease of the optical signal resulting from an enhancement of a non - radiative carrier recombination related to ions.@xcite this limits the efficacy of moke , and other optical methods in dms magnetization determination . to the contrary",
    ", optical effects in semiconductor may be enhanced by implementation of photonic crystals ( pc ) .",
    "the pc that are periodic dielectric nanostructures containing regions of alternate high and low refractive index .",
    "they affect the propagation of the electromagnetic wave similarly as the periodic potential in a crystal affects the motion of electrons and exhibit , in particular , a forbidden gap in frequency domain.@xcite although it was highlighted in a number of works @xcite that combining the advantages offered by both domains : dms and photonics , may enforce a new capabilities in current and future devices , until recently dms and photonics paved their way in the modern physics mostly separately .",
    "our work demonstrates that implementation of even a simple photonic structure enables a meaningful enhancement of magneto - optical effects in dmss .",
    "we present a theoretical design of a dms layer deposited on the top of a single distributed bragg reflector ( dbr ) and show that such design leads to at least a few - fold enhancement of the moke magnitude .",
    "our approach is different from the one developed in , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , where the enhancement of magneto - optical faraday effect was obtained by enclosing a dms layer within a photonic cavity made of two dbr mirrors , or e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , where in order to enhance the moke , a layer with single - domain nanomagnets was placed under a dielectric multilayer .",
    "the simplicity of the proposed design opens a way for its wide practical implementation .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that , with respective material parameters , the calculations can be easily applied to any stratified structure and essentially to any iii - v and ii - vi dms material with any magnetic ion doping different from mn , e.g. , fe or co.    in what follows we introduce the structure design ( sec .",

    "our investigation is focused on , but not bound to , the representative cases of mn - doped wurtzite iii - v and zinc - blende ii - vi structures , that is ( ga , mn)n and ( cd , mn)te , respectively . we consider realistically designed structures .",
    "we assume a presence of a buffer layer , as it is often introduced to gan based structures grown on sapphire substrates in order to reduce density of dislocations limiting the optical signal quality . moreover , we sustain a small difference of refractive indices of layers constituting the mirror , thus small contrast of their compositions , in order to limit the undesirable effects of strain and dislocation density resulting from the lattice mismatch .",

    "the magneto optical kerr effect ( moke ) is a consequence of the magnetic circular birefringence of the medium : the linearly polarized electromagnetic wave after reflection from the surface of the sample magnetized parallel to the light propagation becomes elliptically polarized .",
    "this occurs due to magnetic field induced splitting of bands and resulting difference of refraction coefficient for two opposite circular polarizations of the light .",

    "it is also seen that the real parts of dielectric function for @xmath18 and @xmath19 polarizations differ only in the excitonic region .",
    "it will be shown in the next section that the exciton splitting has a dominant contribution to moke in the near the band gap region .",
    "following the solution of equation [ eq : theta_k ] for parameters and dielectric functions given in section [ sec : structure ] and references cited there , we plot kerr rotation angle as a function of photon energy , as presented in fig .",

    "[ fig : kerr_pe ] shows that the magnitude of the moke increases thanks to the implementation of the proposed structure design .",
    "comparison of the peak - to - peak as well as area under the curve gives evidence for around two times the moke enhancement .",

    "[ fig : kerr_pe_n ] the kerr rotation angle is plotted as a function of the photon energy and the number n of periods constituting the dbr .",
    "the magnitude of the moke increases with the increasing n , saturates for about n = 4 and stays roughly unchanged after further increase of n. the saturation effect seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : kerr_pe_n ] indicates a limitation of the proposed method for the moke enhancement , however fig .",
    "[ fig : kerr_pe_n ] shows that already for a number of the dbr periods as small as 3 or 4 the moke is significantly enhanced with respect to `` no dbr '' case .",
    "this points toward ease of the sample fabrication , an important factor in a view of possible practical implementations of the proposed design .",
    "mn@xmath20n combined with dbr layer as described in the text , plotted versus photon energy and number n of periods constituting dbr mirror . ]    finally , we apply the proposed sample design and conduct respective calculations for the structure involving zinc - blende ii - vi dms , ( cd , mn)te . in contrast to the wurtzite ( ga , mn)n where three excitons contribute to the dielectric function , in the case of cdte based alloys , a zero field splitting of the valence band is typically negligible and one deals with a single exciton contribution to the material dielectric function .",
    "we set the ( cd , mn)te layer thickness @xmath31 nm , and mn quantity amounting to 4% .",
    "the dbr layer consists of cd@xmath7mg@xmath6te and cd@xmath32mg@xmath33te , with thicknesses of 58 nm and 70 nm , respectively .",
    "the number of periods within dbr amounts to 3 . in this design",
    ", there is no buffer layer , and the substrate is made of gaas . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : kerr_pe_cdmnte ] , presenting the kerr rotation angle as a function of the photon energy , the use of the bragg mirror leads to a few fold enhancement of the moke , quantified by the integrated of the area under the curve . there are energy ranges where the moke amplitude is even more enhanced , e.g. , around 1610 mev and 1630 - 1650 mev .",
    "thus , implementation of the dbr in the case of the ( cd , mn)te provides a considerable moke increase .",
    "this indicates the utility of the proposed design in the case of both , iii - v and ii - vi dms .",

    "in this paper , we present the theoretical design of diluted magnetic semiconductor layer combined with the one - dimensional photonic structure ( bragg mirror ) and show that even for a relatively small number of periods and a relatively small contrast of refractive indices of layers constituting the dbr , a significant amplification of the observed magneto - optical effects ( moke ) related to dms layer is achieved .",
    "the presented design allows for a broadening of the range of magnetic ion concentrations within the dms for which moke could be observed .",
    "in particular , it should enable detection of sizable moke even for boundary ( very low or very high ) concentrations of the magnetic dopant , where the quality of magnetooptical signal decreases .",
