    "their orbits are estimated to be nearly circular ( @xmath4 ) , and co - planar ( @xmath5 ) ( brozovi et al . 2014 ) .    while there are doubly synchronous binary asteroid systems with even higher mass ratios ( where satellite mass divided by primary mass is closer to 1 ; main belt asteroid ( 90 ) antiope and trojan asteroid ( 617 ) patroclus are both nearly similarly sized ; richardson and walsh 2006 ) , the seemingly delicate dynamics of the system of small satellites are not found duplicated among asteroid satellite systems .",
    "meanwhile the extreme size of charon relative to pluto makes it unique in the solar system relative to planetary satellites , but the system has some similarity , at least in complexity , to saturn s system . some works , including this one , envision the small satellites forming from a disk or ring of debris .",
    "this disk would differ from saturn s rings , or the recently discovered rings around the centaur ( 10199 ) chariklo ( braga - ribas et al .",

    "it appears that none of the satellites are currently in resonance with charon or each other , and they are not systematically on the inside or outside of resonance , nor do their distances from resonance correlate with size .",
    "the physical properties of the small satellites are difficult to estimate since imaging is limited to optical wavelengths and photometric measurements can determine size only with an estimate for each bodies albedo , and mass only with an estimate for density and size .",
    "orbital stability has been used to place limits on masses of both hypothetical satellites ( pre - discovery ) and also for subsets of the current system .",
    "stern et al . ( 1994 ) studied the stability of hypothetical satellites in the pluto - charon system , primarily placing an upper limit on satellite mass , @xmath6(m@xmath7 + m@xmath8 ) , that would create observable perturbations in charon s orbit . following the discovery of nix and hydra , pires dos santos ( 2011 ) tested for stable regions where more satellites could reside assuming masses of 5.8@xmath9  kg and 3.2@xmath9  kg for nix and hydra respectively ( using masses from tholen et al .",

    "sph simulations show that it likely remained intact following the collision , making it a prototype for an `` intact capture '' type of high impact - parameter collision event ( canup 2005 ) .",
    "formation from a disk following the impact appears to still be dynamically possible ( canup 2005 ) , but the intact capture is preferred due to the fact that charon has a similar density as pluto .",
    "more violent events that result in the accretion of charon from a circum - pluto disk ( similar to the earth - moon scenarios ) lead to the loss of rocky material to pluto and create larger density disparity between pluto and charon ( see desch 2014 for a model to preserve density similarities during the formation of charon from a disk ) .",
    "the high angular momentum of the system , and its doubly synchronous state , point to past tidal evolution from a closer orbit of charon around a more rapidly rotating pluto ( farinella et al .",

    "1989 , cheng 2011 ) .",
    "the sph models of the charon - forming event that satisfy these angular momentum constraints typically find that its orbit would initially have been eccentric ( canup 2005 , 2011 ) .",
    "the possible post - collision orbits for charon are discussed in detail in canup ( 2005,2011 ) , where the initial orbits range between semimajor axes of 4 - 10  @xmath17 , with eccentricities between 0.10.8 ( see fig 5 .",

    "( 2014a ) , show that the tidal evolution of charon required a few million years to reach its current semimajor axis with variations in the orbit evolution dominated by the choice of tidal models .",
    "these recent works consider an initially eccentric orbit for charon as predicted in the `` intact capture '' formation models and they find similar evolution timescales as previous estimates for charon evolving on a circular orbit ( farinella et al .",
    "1979 , dobrovolskis et al 1989 , peale 1999 ) .",
    "solutions where the eccentricity of charon remained moderate were desireable outcomes to test the viability of resonant transport of the satellites in the co - rotation resonance with charon ( ward and canup 2006 , lithwick and wu 2008 , cheng 2011 , cheng et al .",
    "2014a , b ) .",
    "cheng et al .",
    "2014a find for charon to remain moderately eccentric during its tidal evolution the ratio of dissipation between pluto and charon has different values depending on the tidal model used .",
    "however , for a range of these parameters , both tidal models tested by cheng et al .",
    "2014a find evolutions where charon has @xmath180.10.5 for the entire outward evolution , only damping to 0 when charon has reached its current semimajor axis .",
    "there are alternative orbital evolutions due to different initial conditions or tidal parameters .",
    "for example , canup ( 2011 ) finds some collision simulation outcomes where charon has a semimajor axis close to where it is found today , but with a much larger eccentricity ( see figure 5 of canup 2011 ) .",
    "similarly , if the tidal dissipation parameters were substantially different than those used in the calculations the timescale for the evolution could change .",
    "while these extremes are not essential for the work presented here and therefore not discussed in depth , it is possible that other mechanisms for explaining the small satellites may require them .",
    "canup ( 2011 ) characterized the debris created in the `` intact capture '' models in terms of the mass and maximum equivalent circular orbit of disk material ( @xmath20 ) , where @xmath21 is the circular orbit containing the same amount of angular momentum , and @xmath20 is the maximum value for all debris in the simulation ( see fig 6 . ) .",
    "the total mass of debris was typically between @xmath22@xmath23  kg on orbits between @xmath24=230  @xmath17 , with no clear correlation between the two .",
    "typical orbits of post - impact charon are eccentric with @xmath25410  @xmath17 .",
    "holman and weigert ( 1999 ) studied stability around binary systems and find that in a best - case scenario of zero eccentricity for both charon and the debris the closest stable orbit is at @xmath21.974  @xmath26 .",
    "for a nominal formation outcome of @xmath27 @xmath17 , debris closer than @xmath28 @xmath17 , would be immediately unstable .",
    "if charon had an initially eccentric orbit then the nearest stable orbit is further away with less debris being stable .",
    "the current orbits of the small satellites ( @xmath23060  @xmath17 ) , are much further from pluto than any of the debris in the simulations of canup et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and thus it is unlikely that today s satellites formed directly on today s orbits during the formation of charon . any satellites formed during the formation of charon would later witness its outward tidal evolution . as charon moved outward the locations of its mean motion resonances would also move and would sweep over the orbits of any existing satellites .",
    "mean motion resonances with charon would perturb or capture satellites resulting in rapid and destabilizing eccentricity excitement ( ward and canup 2006 ) .",
    "since tidal forces are far too weak to damp the current satellites eccentricities ( stern et al .",
    "2006 ) , their near zero eccentricity orbits also suggest that they did not witness the tidal evolution of charon in their present configuration .",
    "a corotation resonance capture has been proposed as a means to transport satellites without exciting their eccentricities ( ward and canup 2006 ) .",
    "this resonance capture requires a moderate eccentricity for charon during its outward migration .",
    "however , the restrictions on the corotation resonance is that transport in resonance requires a narrow range of eccentricity for charon for each different resonance , and for multiple satellites these requirements are probably mutually exclusive ( lithwick and wu 2008 , cheng 2011 , cheng et al .",
    "with a moderate or large eccentricity for charon it is also possible to capture a satellite in multiple resonances at once and keep a relatively low eccentricity for the satellite .",
    "however , this was found to be an extremely low probability event and also ineffective for the inner resonances where styx and nix are found ( cheng 2011 , cheng et al .",
    "2014b ) .",
    "kenyon and bromeley ( 2014 ) estimate that primordial debris from the pluto - charon forming collision would , by way of a collisional cascade , reach stable orbits just outside the region of orbital instability caused by charon s orbit .",
    "this ring would then spread on timescales of 510 years due to the tidal input of angular momentum into an optically thick disk .",
    "these short timescales , if less than accretion timescales , could permit spreading of the ring into a disk before accretion begins .",
    "an essential aspect of the analytical estimate of the spreading time is that angular momentum transfer among ring particles slows their precession , which helps to maintain low - velocity collisions .",
    "this avoids collisional fragmentation on timescales short compared to that for spreading .",
    "however , kenyon and bromeley ( 2014 ) do not account for the fact that low - velocity collisions will simply result in accretion and growth .",
    "rather , accretion will likely happen before spreading and a disk will not form , something that is found in simulations presented below in section [ s : lipad ] .",
    "the timescales for this disk spreading and satellite growth proposed by kenyon and bromeley ( 2014 ) are faster than the tidal evolution of charon . any satellite system formed in this manner , immediately following the formation of charon , would then be subjected to the sweeping resonances caused by charon s outward tidal evolution that would induce significant eccentricities into the small satellites .",
    "material can also be captured from heliocentric orbit .",
    "two passing objects colliding within the hill sphere of the pluto - charon system can result in capture of some of the collisional debris ( pires dos santos et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the total amount of captured material depends on the orbital and size distributions of the passing material .",
    "pires dos santos et al .",
    "( 2012 ) explored this mechanism finding that large objects that would carry significant mass have collision timescales that are too long , resulting in a very small total amount of captured mass .",
    "how the present satellites or their building blocks got to where they are today is still an open question .",
    "the capture of material from outside the pluto - charon system is inefficient , and moving the present day satellites in various arrangements of orbital resonances has not been demonstrated . moving a single satellite outward",
    "may be possible ( lithwick and wu 2008 ; see also cheng 2011 , cheng et al .",
    "2014b ) , and some eccentricity excitement would be irrelevant if the transported satellite simply served as the source material for the entire suite of today s satellites ( of course too much eccentricity excitement can lead to dynamical ejection or accretion by pluto or charon ) .",
    "a satellite disrupted after the tidal evolution of charon could form a collisionally active disk as envisioned by kenyon and bromeley ( 2014 ) . but growth of satellites from a collisionally damped disk does not imply growth near mean motion resonances , as kenyon and bromeley ( 2014 ) found no strong preference for growth in those locations .",
    "the breakup of a satellite may also form an eccentric ring , which could have strong dynamical interactions with charon at the same time as it is collisionally evolving . similarly",
    ", the disruption of a primordial satellite _ during _ the tidal evolution of charon could have interactions with charon while it is still on an eccentric orbit .",
    "if a satellite is disrupted it will be important if the dynamical environment forces it to re - accrete in a new location .",
    "if the timescale for the disruption and reaccretion of a satellite is short compared to the tidal evolution of charon , then it is a process that could be repeated multiple times",
    ". this could be a way to avoid dynamical ejection of a satellite as repeated disruption and re - accretion events could help it avoid interacting with the strongest resonances that sweep outward as charon s orbit expands .",
    "what happens during its disruption , its evolution as a ring or disk of debris and its reaccumulation into a new satellite could then be important .",
    "here we endeavor to study the evolution of debris following the disruption of a satellite .",
    "the state of the kuiper belt at the time of the charon - forming collision is important for determining the collisional environment of the pluto - charon system during and after its formation .",
    "the giant impact that formed charon was the last giant impact on pluto , but must characterize a substantially different collisional environment in the kuiper belt than is found today .",
    "today the chance of such a collision is essentially zero ( brown et al . 2007 ) .",
    "meanwhile the tidal evolution of charon was relatively short compared to timescales for dynamical mixing and depletion of the kuiper belt ( levison et al .",
    "2008 ) , and thus an enhanced collisional environment may have persisted throughout the entire tidal evolution . in this study",
    "we will repeatedly refer to this idea and consider the possibility that small satellites ( @xmath29  km ) in the pluto - charon system may have had a very short collisional disruption timescales in the epoch immediately following the charon - forming event and _ during _ the tidal evolution of charon .",
    "collisional interactions between particles in the system will change their dynamical evolution by damping of excess energy and changing particles orbits . a satellite experiencing isotropic collisions in orbit",
    "will experience a damping of its radial velocity , decreasing eccentricities .",
    "meanwhile angular momentum of the system is conserved among a collisionally active swarm , so while orbits will evolve to lower eccentricity , @xmath30 , the value of @xmath31 is conserved for the population of particles resulting in decreased semimajor axis @xmath16 , and increased pericenter @xmath32 .",
    "orbits with lower @xmath30 and larger @xmath33 are more stable and longer - lived in the pluto - charon system , and so even small amounts of collisional evolution may be important for increasing lifetimes of satellites or debris .    in this work we focus on the role that collisional evolution could play in both the transport of material outward during the tidal evolution of charon , and also during the accretion of satellites following the conclusion of tidal evolution .",
    "unlike previous works we examine the outcome of satellite disruption around a tidally evolving charon and the formation and evolution of the eccentric ring of debris . for collisional processes to be important there must have been collisions , and material or debris in enough quantity to affect the evolution of the system . specifically we assume , and then explore the idea , that the current satellites we see today are built from the pieces of previous disrupted satellites .    in section [ s :",
    "stab ] we explore stable orbits in @xmath34  space around pluto - charon systems with different eccentricity for charon s orbit since tidal evolution models allow for a range of eccentricities . in section [",
    "s : coldisk ] we explore the collisional evolution of a few simple idealized disks of particles . finally , in section [ s : lipad ] we model the evolution of the debris of a disrupted satellite , and compare this evolution among systems with different eccentricities for charon s orbit , and also around a system with a single central body .",
    "the long term stability of a particle around the pluto - charon pair depends on the particle semimajor axis and the eccentricity of both it s orbit and that of charon .",
    "the innermost stable orbit , often cited as a critical semimajor axis ( @xmath35 ) , is a value that has been explored in detail in previous numerical and analytical work .",
    "holman and weigert ( 1999 ) produced an empirical fit for the @xmath35 as a function of orbital eccentricity ( @xmath30 ) and reduced mass ( @xmath36 . using the pluto - charon reduced mass @xmath37 this simplifies to the following formulation , @xmath38 .",
    "of particular interest for the origin of the small satellites of pluto are regions of stability while charon is tidally evolving , during which charon could have a range of non - zero eccentricities .",
    "we have explored stability limits for the pluto - charon mass ratios , seeking not just the innermost stable orbit , but the envelope of allowable eccentricities as a function of distance from pluto - charon for a range of charon eccentricity .",
    "we include tests for charon eccentricity between 0.00.3 , in steps of 0.1 and consider initial test particle eccentricities ranging from 00.7 , and initial semimajor axes that ranged from 1.355.1 @xmath26 with randomized orbital angles ( see fig [ fig : stab ] ) .",
    "the tests were simulated for 1000  years using the swift_symba5 numerical integrator ( duncan et al .",
    "1998 ) with a timestep of 2@xmath39  years ( 1.75  hours , which is @xmath21/87th charon s orbital period ) .",
    "we consider co - planar or nearly co - planar cases as the observed system of small satellites all appear to be very close to co - planar ( see also pires dos santos et al .",

    "these values were found to agree with those found by dvorak et al .",
    "the simulations performed here find similar innermost stable orbits .",
    "for charon on a circular orbit we find virtually no stable orbits inside of the 3:1  mmr ( @xmath22.08  @xmath26 ; see fig [ fig : stab ] ) , near 1.97  @xmath26 as found in the holman and weigert work .",
    "meanwhile , at the location of the furthest known satellite , hydra , near the 6:1  mmr , particles are unstable with @xmath42 .",
    "we have made an empirical fit to the stable region when @xmath43 with a curve described by @xmath44 .",

    ", width=307 ]    an important aspect of this result is that particles with an eccentricity above the established @xmath16-@xmath30 curve are unstable on short timescales .",
    "however , if their collisional timescale is shorter , then a series of collisions need only to decrease their orbital eccentricity below these stability limits to keep them in the system for long times .",
    "another implication of this experiment is that while charon has a high eccentricity , at times as high as 0.3 as suggested by peale ( 2011 ) , the current orbits of nix , p4 and p5 would not be stable .",
    "thus , we could expect that these bodies formed after the eccentricity damping of charon or were in a stable resonant state that increased their stability .",

    "we model the collisional interactions of the ring particles and their effects on the ring s eccentricity and semimajor axis .    required for these tests are the calculations of inter - particle collision outcomes .",
    "the frequency and outcome of collisions are strongly dependent on relative particle sizes , total system mass and orbital distributions , all of which can change rapidly owing to accretion , fragmentation and gravitational interactions with charon .",
    "statistical calculations must be made in order to model high collisional frequencies possible for populations of small particles .",
    "if each particle were included directly in a simulation the total number of particles ( @xmath49 ) of any calculation would be overwhelmingly large .",

    ".    the primary code we employ is lipad , which stands for lagrangian integrator for planetary accretion and dynamics ( levison et al . 2012 ) .",
    "it is based on the efficient integration techniques known as the wisdom - holman mapping ( whm ; wisdom & holman 1991 ) , and specifically symba that has the added property of treating close encounters between bodies ( duncan et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in order to represent the extremely large number of particles required lipad relies on `` tracer '' particles .",
    "each of the tracer particles represents a large number of comparably - sized particles on very similar orbits .",
    "each tracer is defined by three quantities , the physical radius @xmath50 , the bulk density @xmath51 and the total mass of particles that the tracer represents @xmath52 . throughout the simulation @xmath52 and @xmath51 do not change . when fragmentation and accretion are included the radius @xmath50 can change and thus the number of particles that the tracer represents will change as a function of @xmath50 , with @xmath53 . for all of the work presented here , the density of each tracer is set at 1  @xmath54  @xmath55 .",
    "collisional probabilites for tracers are calculated for each tracer as a function of its size @xmath50 and the total mass , sizes and orbits of its neighbors using particle - in - a - box algorithms .",
    "the outcome of the collision then affects the tracer particle itself , as though it were a planetesimal of radius @xmath50 , so that each tracer is tracing the behavior of the system ( see section 2.1.1 of levison et al .",
    "2012 for more details on the tracer - tracer interactions ) .",
    "meanwhile the dynamics of each tracer is modeled with gravity calculations and other effects that are handled statistically ( dynamical friction , viscous stirring ) , some of which depend on the particle s radius @xmath50 and the masses , sizes and orbits of its neighbors .",
    "a particular advantage for this problem is that the lagrangian nature of the code enables it to model eccentric rings ( see levison and morbidelli 2007 , levison et al .",
    "when a tracer is determined to have collided with another particle , it is necessary to determine the properties of the impactor .",
    "the orbit that the impactor would have had prior to impact is determined by tracking particles that have most recently inhabited the correct regime of semimajor axis @xmath16 and radius @xmath50 . from this list of possible impactors",
    "the one with the closest true anomaly is selected , which was shown by levison and morbidelli ( 2007 ) to be critical to support asymmetries and eccentric rings .",
    "when collisions occur lipad uses a fragmentation law based on benz & asphaug ( 1999 ) to determine the outcomes .",
    "this fragmentation law determines the expected size distribution of fragments , but the entire distribution is not assigned to either tracer - rather a radius @xmath50 is chosen for each from the distribution .",
    "the system s size distribution is built from a number of tracer particles with different sizes @xmath50 , and matches standard collisional evolution codes owing to the statistical nature of the radius selection from a large number of collisions ( see levison et al .",
    "2012 ) .    for the cases presented in this section the collisional fragmentation and growth of particles is not used , rather we simply explore the role of collisional damping .",
    "the first test case , dubbed `` simple eccentric disk '' , is designed to examine how the perturbations of charon change the evolution of a collisionally active disk at distances similar to the current small satellites .",
    "this test begins with a co - planar disk of particles with the same semimajor axis @xmath56 and eccentricity @xmath57 , and randomized orbital angles ( see fig [ 5to1]a ) .",

    "the equivalent circular orbit of disk material ( @xmath24 ) is inside the 5:1  mmr at @xmath22.85  @xmath26 , meaning that removal of orbital energy by collisional damping , while conserving angular momentum would result in a ring at this lower semimajor axis orbit .",
    "all of the particles are initially within the stability boundaries defined above in section [ fig : stab ] , and are therefore stable for long timescales .",

    "the satellite system of pluto remains mysterious . as stated earlier , there are two major problems with the small satellites of pluto , and we can report progress on one of the two .",
    "the first problem is that the satellites today are much more distant than can be explained by charon - formation impact models . here , by including collisional evolution in dynamical models",
    ", we have found that debris can experience substantial kicks from charon while on unstable orbits , but then return to stable orbits due to collisions with other orbiting debris .",
    "this effect can result in the movement of material outward in the system .",

    "the tidal evolution timescale of charon is on the order of a few million years and so collisional lifetimes must have been shorter than this for this to be important . however , it is expected that the charon - forming collision happened in a different collision environment than found today in the kuiper belt and collisional timescales for @xmath2100  km bodies must have been very short . understanding",
    "the collisional history of both bodies by investigations with the _ new horizons _ spacecraft mission may help to better understand these issues .",
    "this , in effect , suggests that today s small satellites are essentially the last in multiple generations of previous satellites .",
    "the second problem is the curious configuration of the small satellites , each near a mmr with charon .",
    "there were indications in some simulations that collisionally active disks of debris would damp into a ring sturcture and could be caught while crossing a mmr ( as found fortuitously in the simulation shown in figure [ fighm5_48_e2 ] ) . however , a larger parameter space of simulations using a full fragmentation and accretion model failed to show a strong preference at any eccentricity of charon .",

    "the importance of this effect could not be investigated here due to computational limitations , but could be potentially be responsible for building small satellites one mmr inward of a larger satellite .    can success be claimed in the first problem and not the second ? if collisional damping of an eccemtric ring is necessary to move material outwards should it not also explain the orbital configuration ?",
    "it is certainly possible that collisional evolution as tested here is not important or that there was another more dominant mechanism that could both move the satellites or their building blocks and result in their organized accretion near resonance .",
    "it is also possible that we have uncovered the means to move material outward in the system , and that there are more or different effects that will ultimately be responsible for the final orbital configuration .",
    "is it possible that we are simply being fooled by the system and that the orbital configuration is just luck ?",
    "while four satellites near resonance is hard to explain , both kerberos and styx both reside in relatively narrow regions of orbital stability ( pires dos santos et al . 2012 , youdin et al . 2013 ) .",
    "nix and hydra themselves are near a resonant configuration with each other , and so it is conceivable that kereberos and styx simply formed in the only places they could in a system with two more massive satellites that were somehow pushed into or near a resonance with each other .",
    "another question that this work can address with the tools developed here relates to the very first step of this entire process  the survival of any debris immediately following the formation of charon . in the preceeding sections",
    ", we assumed that the post - impact debris measured by canup ( 2011 ) would survive and remain in the pluto - charon system , despite the typically close orbits ( @xmath210  @xmath3 ) and the potentially high eccentricity of charon . using the same simulation configuration described above we have done a series of tests to estimate the collision rates necessary to stabilize debris at the formation distances found in canup ( 2011 ) .",
    "for a charon eccentricity of 0.3 , we considered disk masses of @xmath89 and @xmath90  kg ( brozovi et al .",
    "2014 estimated @xmath91  kg ) , placed on orbits at approximately @xmath92 .",
    "this configuration is similar to the @xmath93 typically found for the debris relative to @xmath94 for charon in canup ( 2011 ) .",
    "the simulations used the same collisional debris setup as explored in the previous sections .    only in the most massive case did significant amounts of debris survive . for @xmath90",
    "kg only 5 particles were left at 500 years , and no coherent ring structure ever formed .",
    "increasing to @xmath95  kg a very tenuous ring structure formed from the 70 particles that survived for 500 years , but for @xmath96  kg case over 800 particles remained , formed a ring , and experienced significant growth .",
    "the largest particle reached 4.8  km , and the recognizable `` tower '' structure grew between the 6:1 and 7:1  mmr .",
    "these tests spanned the critical regime where the collision rate became high enough to keep debris in the system .",
    "the collision rates of 0.006 , 0.039 and 0.102 collisions per particle per charon orbit were found for the lowest to highest mass cases respectively , and thus a rate between the latter two values can be considered the critical limit for survival of debris in this scenario .",
    "the canup ( 2011 ) simulations found total masses of debris ranging from @xmath97  kg ( only 3 of 19 simulations were below @xmath98  kg ) .",
    "while the masses are typically above what was used in this test ( with many simulations with 23 orders of magnitude higher mass ) , the collision rate will be the important quantity and will depend on the size distribution of debris in the system .    looking beyond the pluto - charon system",
    ", some of the dynamical interactions between a massive perturber and a disk or ring of debris could be relevant on planetary scales . in our own solar system",
    "the scattered disk of kuiper belt objects shows the characteristic orbital features of having been excited by neptune . in the context of this work , the dynamically excited scattered disk would have collisionally damped if the characteristic collisional timescales were shorter than the dynamical lifetimes .    beyond our solar system , there are circum - binary planets orbiting stellar systems with mass ratios similar to pluto - charon ( see kepler-16b reported in doyle et al .",
    "2011 and kepler-34b and kepler-35b reported in welsh et al .",
    "many of the effects driving planet formation in these systems will be different , particularly effects of the gaseous stellar nebula ( see meschiari 2014 ) , but some of the orbital perturbations on the planetary building blocks will be of similar magnitude as those on satellite building blocks around pluto and charon .    in summary ,",
    "this work has made progress on part of the confounding problems of the small satellites of pluto .",
    "hopefully this and other recent works , when combined with a very detailed study of the system by way of the _ new horizons _ spacecraft mission ( stern 2008 ) , will help to solve some of these outstanding mysteries ."

    "<S> pluto s system of 5 known satellites are in a puzzling orbital configuration . </S>",
    "<S> each of the four small satellites are on low - eccentricity and low - inclination orbits situated near a mean motion resonance with the largest satellite charon . </S>",
    "<S> the pluto - charon binary likely formed as a result of a giant impact and so the simplest explanation for the small satellites is that they accreted from debris of that collision . </S>",
    "<S> the pluto - charon binary has evolved outward since its formation due to tidal forces , which drove them into their current doubly synchronous state . meanwhile , </S>",
    "<S> leftover debris from the formation of charon was not initially distant enough from pluto - charon to explain the orbits of the current small satellites . </S>",
    "<S> the outstanding problems of the system are the movement of debris outward and the small satellites location near mean motion resonances with charon .    </S>",
    "<S> this work explores the dynamical behavior of collisionally interacting debris orbiting the pluto - charon system . </S>",
    "<S> while this work specifically tests initial disk and ring configurations designed to mimic the aftermath of the disruption of satellites by heliocentric impactors , we generally find that collisional interactions can help move material outwards and keep otherwise unstable material dynamically bound to the pluto - charon system . </S>",
    "<S> these processes can produce rings of debris whose orbits evolve rapidly due to collisional processes , with increasing pericenters and decreasing semimajor axes . </S>",
    "<S> while these rings and disks of debris eventually build satellites significantly further out than the initial locations of a disrupted satellite , they do not show a strong preference for building satellites in or near mean motion resonances with charon under a wide array of tested conditions . </S>"
