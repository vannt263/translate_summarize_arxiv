    "we present a detailed optical spectroscopic study of 20 high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) using the 2df ( two - degree field ) multi - object spectrograph on the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) . in this study",
    "we have used the 2df spectrograph to confirm the classification of candidate be / x - ray binaries ( be - xrbs ; the most numerous subclass of smc hmxbs ) as emission - line stars and identify their spectral type . although this is only a pilot study , it is at the same time a spectroscopic survey of a relatively large number of be - xrbs and candidates over a large wavelength range .",
    "this provides a deep census of the x - ray binary ( xrb ) population in this galaxy even in low activity levels , which is critical for understanding the characteristics of the overall population .",
    "the smc is one of the best targets to study a , as complete as possible , population of young xrbs .",
    "similar studies in the galaxy are hampered by extinction and distance uncertainties .",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is much more extended than the smc , requiring large area coverage to obtain sufficient numbers of xrbs , while other local group galaxies are too far to reach the quiescent population of hmxbs ( typical @xmath0 ; van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , the smc hosts a large number of hmxbs ( e.g. haberl & pietsch 2004 , mcbride 2008 , antoniou 2009 ) when compared to the milky way and the lmc .",
    "this excess is explained by the combination of a star - formation burst at @xmath1 myr at regions where the hmxbs are located ( antoniou 2009 ; consistent with the age of maximum formation of be stars , given by mcswain & gies 2005 ) , and by the low smc metallicity ( antoniou 2009 , mcbride 2008 ) .",
    "simulations show that neither the metallicity nor the star - formation burst alone can produce such a high number of hmxbs in the smc ( dray 2006 ) .",
    "thus , the smc is an excellent laboratory to study the be - xrb populations .",
    "the most representative studies of spectroscopically identified be - xrbs are those of mcbride ( 2008 ) , who investigated the spectral distribution of 37 in total smc be - xrb pulsars , and of negueruela & coe ( 2002 ) , who presented high - resolution blue - band spectroscopy for 13 lmc be - xrbs . however , the main limitation of detailed studies of the hmxb population in the smc is the lack of spectral classification of the optical counterparts of a large fraction of the detected sources , while the vast majority of the studies available in the literature either do not present the spectra and/or the criteria used for the spectral classification .",
    "this severely hampers the construction of a large coherent sample of be - xrbs .",
    "motivated by the limitations of the current studies , and in order to classify the different type of xrbs and separate them from the various interlopers ( background / foreground sources ) , we initiated an optical spectroscopic campaign of a large number of candidate smc be - xrbs , detected either in our observations or other published x - ray surveys of the smc .",
    "the goal of this campaign is to confirm the be classification of each system ( often based on photometric data ) , identify its spectral type , and even identify any possible interlopers .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following . in section [ sample ] , we describe the sample of sources we observed with the 2df spectrograph ; and in section [ obsreduction ] , the observations and data reduction , along with the optical and near - infrared properties of the sources . in section [ criteriasptypes ] , we discuss the criteria used for the classification of the optical spectra , and the comparison of the classification of sources from the present work with those of previous studies . in section [ 2dfdiscussion ]",
    ", we discuss these results in the context of the be stars and be - xrb populations in the galaxy and the lmc , and we investigate correlations between the emission and the orbital period and infrared colors of the systems",
    ". finally , we present the main results of this study in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "our sample is primarily selected from the shallow survey of the smc ( a. zezas 2009 , in preparation ; antoniou 2009 ) , and it also includes candidate and known be - xrbs from the census of haberl & pietsch ( 2004 ; based mainly on observations with ) . the overall strategy of this pilot study was to observe the optical counterparts of confirmed and candidate be - xrbs . in total , we have observed 113 and 27 and sources , respectively .",
    "we note that even though the 2df spectrograph allows the allocation of @xmath2400 fibers , the stellar density of the selected fields , which lie along the smc `` bar '' , did not allow us to observe more objects at a given time due to collision of the fibers .",
    "twenty - nine out of the 113 sources do not have an optical match in the ogle - ii and/or mcps catalogs ( based on the analysis of antoniou 2009 ) , we thus obtained blind spectra , i.e. we placed the fiber at the location of an x - ray source , in order to obtain a spectrum of any object at that position . for the remaining sources , the typical v - band magnitude of the optical counterparts was @xmath3 mag .",
    "in addition to the sources we also observed 9 confirmed and 18 candidate be - xrbs from the compilation of haberl & pietsch ( 2004 ) .",
    "the optical spectra for this work were obtained during service time in 2004 november , with the 2df multiple - fiber spectrograph at the prime focus of the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope ( lewis 2002 ) .",
    "the observations were taken at airmass between 1.35 and 1.48 , and the seeing was @xmath4 .",
    "we used the @xmath5 grating ( 300b ) , which gave a 4400 wavelength coverage ( from 3640 to 8040 region ) at an instrumental dispersion of 4.3 / pixel .",
    "four 2250s exposures were obtained , providing a total exposure time of 9000s .",
    "the on - target exposures were preceded and followed by arc calibration exposures ( cuar and cuhe ) and fiber - flat - field exposures .",
    "approximately 30  sky \" fibers located on star - free regions ( 15 for each spectrograph ) were assigned , to ensure good definition of the sky background .",
    "successful use of the 2df spectrograph depends on the source positions being accurate to better than 0.5 arcsec , in order to avoid significant light loss from the 2-arcsec - diameter fibers .",
    "positions were used from ogle - ii ( which has a small astrometric error of @xmath6 ; udalski 1998 ) whenever possible to fulfill this requirement . in order to achieve accurate pointing and guide the telescope successfully during the observations we chose 4 sources as fiducial stars evenly spaced through the 2df field .",
    "these stars were chosen from the 2mass catalog , however they have consistent coordinates in the ogle - ii catalog and they abide by the suggestions listed in the 2df manual ( e.g. brighter than 15.0 magnitude stars which should not cover more than a one magnitude range ) .",
    "nevertheless , some loss in counts is expected to be caused by the small number of fiducial stars used to guide the field plate and due to the small positional mismatches between fiber and object positions .",
    "the data preparation and spectral extraction were performed using the _ 2dfdr _ software ( lewis 2002 ) .",
    "the main steps include bias subtraction , extraction of the spectra from the ccd image , division by a normalized flat - field , wavelength calibration , calibration of the fiber throughputs , and subtraction of the scaled median sky spectrum ( derived from the sky - fiber spectra ) .",
    "extraction of the spectra , spectral line fitting and ew line measurements were performed with the _ dipso _ v3.6 - 3 and figaro v4.11 packages of starlink . in particular , we measured the center of each line and its full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) using a gaussian fit ( _ elf _ subroutine ) , while for the ew we used the _ ew _ subroutine of the _ dipso _ package .",
    "due to the different throughput of each fiber ( which is also wavelength - dependent ) , it is difficult to flux calibrate spectra from a multi - fiber instrument such as 2df , as a flux standard should be -in principle- observed through each fiber .",
    "an average response curve can be applied to give an approximate relative flux calibration , however , the results for individual spectra can vary considerably ( lewis 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , flux calibration was not attempted .",
    "this does not affect our analysis , as our classification criteria are based on the presence or absence of spectral lines rather than their absolute intensity .",
    "whenever comparisons between strengths of lines are used , care is taken to use lines close in wavelength , in which case the fiber response is identical , for all practical purposes .",
    "fibers that were assigned to objects fainter than @xmath7 mag in v - band , yielded low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio spectra .",
    "we defined a nominal @xmath8 ratio of each spectrum using the counts in the 5600-6200 range ( measured using the _ istat _ package of figaro v4.11 ) which can be considered as representative of the local continuum .",
    "spectra with @xmath9400 average counts in this wavelength range were excluded from the present study , as it was difficult to perform accurate spectral classification for them .",
    "this leaves 58 spectra for further consideration .",
    "all but one of these 58 sources exhibit emission",
    ".    the presence of emission is one of the main classification criteria for be - xrbs .",
    "we thus focus on the study of emission - line objects . however , the inner regions of the smc show strong and variable diffuse emission from hii regions and supernova remnants ( snrs ) . due to hardware limitations",
    "it is not possible to obtain sky spectra within a few arcseconds from each source , which in turn does not allow us to accurately subtract the variable local background .",
    "therefore , some of our object spectra may be contaminated by the typical interstellar emission lines : @xmath10\\ , \\lambda5007}$ ] , @xmath11\\ , \\lambda\\lambda6548 , 6584}$ ] , and @xmath12\\ , \\lambda\\lambda6716 , 6731}$ ] .",
    "for this reason we adopt a conservative approach and we focus only on objects with minimal interstellar contamination .",
    "the selection of such objects is based on the width of the line and their ratio .",
    "be stars exhibit broad emission ( e.g. coe 2005 ) , whereas the interstellar emission lines are typically narrow",
    ". therefore , selection of objects with broad emission allows us to identify objects with small interstellar contamination .",
    "we choose a low limit for the fwhm of the line @xmath13 , based on the average fwhm of this line from high s / n spectra of known be - xrbs and be - xrb pulsars , which are observed as part of the present work .",
    "in total , we find 22 sources with fwhm greater than 9.5 .",
    "two of these sources have broad but extremely weak emission when compared to the other sources , thus they are not considered for further investigation .",
    "based on the above criteria our sample is limited to 20 sources .",
    "we note that there could be additional bona - fide be - xrbs in the remaining sample , however the absence of a broad component makes their classification uncertain .",
    "the selection of these sources as bona - fide be - xrbs is confirmed by their high ratio .",
    "be stars typically do not show forbidden high excitation emission lines ( with the only exception of the subclass of b[e ] stars ; e.g. lamers 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , the presence of @xmath146716  emission is a signature of significant contamination from the diffuse interstellar emission .",
    "we determine the average to strength ratio of the diffuse emission from the spectra of the sky fibers which uniformly probe the observed area .",
    "this gives an average local  sky \" value of to ratio of @xmath15 .",
    "all objects which fulfill the width criterion also have to ratio at least @xmath16 below the average sky ratio .",
    "this gives us further confidence that the emission - line objects we selected for further study are indeed be stars .",
    "in addition , although we can not rule out the possibility that some of the remaining observed sources could be be - xrbs , none of the discarded sources with good s / n has low enough to ratio to fulfill the above criterion .",
    "this indicates that we do not miss a significant population of be - xrbs among the remaining sources .",
    "however , because of these criteria , our sample is biased towards objects with stronger emission .",
    "based on the above analysis , we found 20 objects with good quality optical spectra obtained in this run , and known x - ray properties typical of hmxbs ( e.g. hard x - ray spectrum and/or detection of pulsations ) .",
    "out of the 20 objects , the spectra of which are presented here , only 2 have good quality published optical spectra in the full wavelength range ( @xmath17 ) , while one source has been observed only in the red portion of the optical spectrum around h@xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "these 20 sources are presented in table [ otherxrayname ] . in column 1",
    "we list the x - ray source i d as given in antoniou ( 2009 ; ( field id)-(src i d within the field ) ) for sources , while the xmm i d refers to sources from haberl & pietsch ( 2004 ) .",
    "other names for the _ xmm - newton _ sources and their references ( column 2 ) are taken from the latter work . in column 3",
    "we present the x - ray pulsar i d ( defined as the pulse period in seconds ) .",
    "finally , in column 4 we list the associated emission - line object from the catalog of meyssonnier & azzopardi ( 1993 ; hereafter [ ma93 ] ) . with the present observations we will investigate the be - xrb nature of these 20 objects and we will study their spectral characteristics , in conjunction with their optical and near - infrared properties .",
    "the optical and near - infrared counterparts of the studied x - ray sources are present in table [ 2dfoptids ] .",
    "in particular , the optical counterparts of the sources are taken from antoniou ( 2009 ) .",
    "following the same approach for the sources , we cross - correlated their positions with the ogle - ii ( udalski 1998 ) and mcps catalogs ( zaritsky 2002 ) using a search radius of 5 around each x - ray source ( brusa 2007 ) . in column 1 we give the x - ray source i d ( as in table [ otherxrayname ] ) , and in columns 2 and 3 the x - ray source coordinates ( right ascension and declination , respectively ) . in column 4",
    "we present the optical counterpart of the x - ray source from the ogle - ii and/or mcps catalogs .",

    "the optical ( _ v , b - v _ ) data of the sources are presented in columns [ 6 ] and [ 7 ] along with their errors ( these data are taken directly from the original catalogs without applying any reddening or zero - point correction ) : apparent magnitude in the _ v _ band ( column 6 ) , and _ b - v _ color ( column 7 ) . for one source ( xmm-47 )",
    "we found an optical counterpart in slightly larger distance from the x - ray source position ( within 5.3 and 4.9 in the ogle - ii and mcps catalogs , respectively ) .",
    "the near - infrared counterparts of the be - xrbs studied here are taken from the 2mass catalog ( skrutskie 2006 ) .",
    "column 8 lists the closest 2mass counterpart i d within 2 from the x - ray source position , and columns 9 and 10 the j , and k magnitudes along with their errors .",

    "the full ( 3650-8000 ) wavelength calibrated spectra of the 20 smc be - xrbs are given in figure [ 2dfspecbexrbs ] .",
    "the early - type nature of the stars is apparent in all spectra , as is their strong emission .",
    "the contribution of telluric emission lines is sometimes not well subtracted ( due to the difficulties in sky subtraction in multifiber observations discussed earlier ) leaving emission and/or absorption features around the [ oi]@xmath20 lines . moreover , telluric absorption bands of molecular oxygen are obvious in the red part of our spectra , around 6875 , and 7610 . finally , some diffuse interstellar emission lines can also be seen in some of the spectra , including [ oiii]@xmath21 , [ oii]@xmath22 , [ nii]@xmath23  and [ sii]@xmath24 .    in table",

    "the errors represent the 68% confidence intervals for one interesting parameter .",
    "we found published ew measurements for 8 of our sources .",
    "we present these values in column [ 8 ] along with their source ( given in parenthesis ) .",
    "they are in good agreement , despite the expected scatter , given the variable nature of be stars ( e.g. mcswain 2008 ) , and the different disk inclination in which they may have been observed ( dachs 1986 ) .",
    "the emission - line profiles in the spectra of table [ ewfwhm ] are very simple with no signs of double or split peaks .",
    "however , because of the resolution of the used grating , we may not have been able to resolve any asymmetries or double peaks .",
    "in addition , in column [ 9 ] we give the orbital period of the hmxbs in this sample from the literature ( liu 2005 and references therein ) , and we use these values in order to study the properties of the decretion disk in relation to the parameters of the binary system ( see discussion in section [ porbital ] below ) .    in figure [ ewdistr ]",
    "we show the distribution of the ews for be - xrbs ( solid histograms ) and be stars ( open histograms ) .",
    "we note here that by using the term be stars throughout this paper we refer to field and cluster be stars that do not exhibit x - ray emission characteristic of xrbs .",
    "these distributions are shown for the smc ( top panel ) , the lmc ( middle panel ) and the milky way ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the data for the smc be - xrbs are taken from the present study and are supplemented by the catalog of coe ( 2005 ) , while for the smc be stars we used data from the study of the star - cluster ngc330 by martayan ( 2007a ) .",
    "the data for the lmc be - xrbs are taken from liu ( 2005 ; and references therein ) , while the lmc be sample is from the study of the star - cluster ngc2004 by martayan ( 2006a ) .",
    "the data for the galactic be - xrbs are taken from reig ( 2007 ) and liu ( 2006 ; and references therein ) , while for the galactic be stars we used data from ashok ( 1984 ) , supplemented with data from fabregat & reglero ( 1990 ) , dachs ( 1986 ) , and dachs , hummel & hanuschik ( 1992 ) .",
    "we note that the above galactic be samples contain field stars . in order for the above comparisons to be valid , we selected be - xrbs and be stars within the same spectral - type range in each of the 3 galaxies .",
    "be - xrbs in the milky way and the lmc have spectral types up to b2 , while the majority of such systems in the smc is found to have spectral types b3 or earlier ( see discussion in section [ sptypediscuss ] and figure [ bspecsubtdistr ] below ) .",
    "the spectral types of galactic sources with ew measurements used here are taken from andrillat & fehrenbach ( 1982 ) and skiff ( 2007 ; and references therein ) , while for the smc and lmc be stars we used data from martayan ( 2007b ) and ( 2006b ) , respectively .",
    "in total we have used 41 galactic be stars , 21 galactic be - xrbs , 116 smc be stars , 35 smc be - xrbs , 5 lmc be - xrbs and 42 lmc be stars . from figure [ ewdistr ]",
    "we see that the ew distribution of smc be - xrbs peaks at @xmath25 , while that of smc be field stars peaks at @xmath26 .",
    "this is in agreement with reig ( 1997 ) and zamanov ( 2001 ) who reported that be stars in xrbs have on average a lower ew when compared to be stars , due to the truncation of the disk by the compact object . for the lmc and the milky way ,",
    "the comparison is hampered by the small size of the samples .",
    "on the other hand , dachs ( 1992 ) found that be stars with larger ew have larger radii of their emitting circumstellar disks .",
    "grundstrom & gies ( 2006 ) used numerical models to show that the predicted radius of the be disk , based on ew , is monotonically related to the observed disk radius with long baseline interferometry . from the above figure",
    ", we also see that the be stars in the magellanic clouds ( hereafter mcs ) have larger ew values when compared to the galactic sample , thus indicating larger disks around them .",
    "martayan ( 2007a ) , who find similar results , suggest that the higher ews ( especially in the smc ) indicate the presence of more extended circumstellar envelopes around a fraction of be stars .",
    "we also note that some be stars may be in fact in binary systems .",
    "however , even if some of those prove to be binaries , we do not expect their ew distributions to change significantly .",
    "the identification and classification of the optical counterparts of the x - ray sources allow us to identify the interlopers and determine the type of xrbs ( e.g. be - xrbs , supergiant xrbs , low - mass xrbs ) . in figure [ cmd2df ] we present",

    "we also show the ngc330 be stars ( martayan 2007a ) , while with gray small dots we present the ogle - ii stars that lie in our field 4 and have small errors in the _ v _ and _ b _ band ( @xmath29 mag ) . the main sequence ,",
    "the red giant branch and the red clump loci are clearly seen . in this figure , we overplot the isochrones from the geneva database ( lejeune & schaerer 2001 ) for the metallicity of the young smc stars ( @xmath30}=-0.68\\pm0.13 $ ] dex , equivalent to @xmath31 ; luck 1998 ) , for ages of 8.7 myr to 275.4 myr .",
    "the position of all the x - ray sources in the cmd agrees well with the ngc330 be stars .",
    "we also see that the be - xrbs from our sample and the be stars from martayan ( 2007a ) are at the right of the main sequence , as expected given that be stars are generally redder than b - type stars ( e.g. mcswain & gies 2005 ) , while they all lie between the @xmath32 myr and @xmath33 myr isochrones .",
    "most be stars exhibit infrared excess ( gehrz , hackwell & jones 1974 ) due to the disk contribution to the continuum emission .",

    "we also show the j - k color distribution of be stars of luminosity class iii - v ( gray hatched histogram ) and of all non - emission b - type stars ( i.e. excluding the above be stars sample ; gray filled histogram ) using data from the 2df smc spectroscopic survey of evans ( 2004 )",
    ". for clarity , the number of sources in the be - xrb and be stars sample is normalized by a factor of 2 .",

    "non - emission b - type stars show a skewed distribution , which peaks at @xmath34 - 0.1 mag .",
    "the primary spectral classification criteria for ob stars are usually based on metal line strengths except for the earliest subtypes which are based on hei and heii lines ( e.g. lennon 1997 ) .",
    "however , due to the low metallicity of the smc sources , the metal lines are very weak ( see also evans 2004 ) hampering the classification based on them .",
    "therefore , we adopt the classification scheme of evans ( 2004 ) , although , due to the lower resolution of our spectra , it was not always possible to use all the proposed indicators .    according to this scheme , the spectral classification is based on the blue part of the spectrum ( 3800-5000  wavelength range ) .",
    "the presence of heii absorption lines ( heii@xmath35 ) indicates spectral types earlier than or equal to b0 .",
    "strong hei lines are also indicative of early spectral types . their strength increases with decreasing temperature , while it peaks around b2 .",
    "the main characteristic of early b - type stars is the absence of lines of ionized helium ( heii ) , which are still present in late o - type stars .",
    "thus , in b0.5 stars , heii@xmath36 and heii@xmath37 are absent , while heii@xmath38 is weak . in b1 stars ,",
    "heii@xmath38 disappears , while siiv@xmath39 lines appear . for spectral types later than b1.5 the oii+ciii@xmath40 blend decreases rapidly , and disappears for stars later than b3 . for spectral types b2 or later mgii@xmath41 and siiii@xmath42 become stronger .",
    "comparison between the strengths of these two lines is used to distinguish between b2 , b2.5 , and b3 types . for spectral types b5 or later",
    "the classification is based mainly on the absence of siiii@xmath42 . in b8 stars",
    "hei@xmath43 is stronger than siii@xmath44 , which in turn is stronger than hei@xmath45 . finally , for b9 stars mgii@xmath41 appears stronger than hei@xmath46 . in table",

    "in addition , two sources with hard x - ray spectra have been previously spectroscopically classified as b - type stars ( i.e. non - be stars ) in the study of evans ( 2004 ) .",
    "furthermore , one object was classified as b - type star showing balmer emission , but no further classification has been provided ( garmany & humphreys 1985 ) .",
    "the present study examines these classifications , since only spectroscopy can unambiguously identify the nature of the donor with that of a be star . due to the absence of flux calibration and the relatively low resolution of our spectra it was not possible to assign with certainty a spectral luminosity class to our objects . for the same reason , evans ( 2004 ) , who have used the same spectrograph ,",
    "have relied on a photometric / spectroscopic approach to estimate the luminosity class .    because later - type main - sequence stars are also fainter , and because the present spectroscopic sample is obviously flux limited , there is an obvious selection effect favoring earlier spectral types .",
    "the faintest of these 20 sources ( which has @xmath47 counts in the 5600-6200 wavelength range ) has been classified here as a b0 - 4e star , thus our sample is complete up to mid - b .",
    "we find good agreement between our and other published spectral - type classifications for 9 out of the 15 sources with published classification .",

    ", we have used the classification derived from the present work .    in figure [ bspecsubtdistr ]",
    "we present the b spectral subtype distributions of be - xrbs ( solid histograms ) and of be stars ( dashed histograms ) in the smc ( top panel ) , the lmc ( middle panel ) , and the milky way ( bottom panel ) .",
    "negative spectral subtypes correspond to o - type stars .",
    "whenever only a broad spectral class was available , we equally divided the contribution in the different subtypes .    for the smc ,",
    "the data for be stars are taken from evans ( 2004 ; 168 in total ) , and for be - xrbs from our sample supplemented by the recent study of mcbride ( 2008 ; 46 in total ) .",
    "the galactic be stars ( 148 in total ) are taken from the study of slettebak ( 1982 ) .",
    "for the galactic be - xrbs we used 20 sources from the census of reig ( 2007 ) , 4 additional from the work of mcbride ( 2008 ) , and 2 more from the catalog of liu ( 2006 ) .",
    "for the 14 lmc be - xrbs we used the spectral types from the census of liu ( 2005 ) .",
    "the lmc be stars ( 103 in total ) are taken from martayan ( 2006b ) .    in order to check the null hypothesis that different samples of be - xrbs and be stars are drawn from the same populations , we perform the two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test ( e.g. , conover 1971 ) .",
    "the results of the p - values are presented in table [ kstest ] , a two - way table with the compared distributions for be - xrbs and be stars listed in its rows and columns . because of the small size of the lmc be - xrbs sample we also check these results with the two - sided mann - whitney - wilcoxon test ( bauer 1972 ) .",
    "in addition , because it is very difficult to obtain accurate spectral types for stars later than mid b - type in the mcs , we repeat the above analysis by using the peto & prentice generalized wilcoxon test ( lavalley , isobe & feigelson 1992 ) and assuming lower limits to the spectral subtypes later than b3 in all samples and later than b1 and b2 in the lmc and galactic be - xrb samples , respectively .",
    "the three tests agree only in the case of very small ( @xmath860.1 ) or very large ( @xmath870.9 ) p - values , while intermediate values are not informative .",
    "in particular , small p - values ( @xmath860.1 ) are indicative of the different populations from where these distributions are drawn .",
    "based on these results , we can not definitely say if the smc be - xrbs follow a different spectral - type distribution from galactic and lmc be - xrbs .",
    "this is consistent with mcbride ( 2008 ) , who note that there is indication for similar distributions in the smc and the milky way .",
    "we find similar spectral - type distributions between lmc and galactic be - xrbs ( p - value=1.0 ) , in agreement with negueruela & coe ( 2002 ) , although we note the small size of the samples .",
    "regarding the distributions of be - xrbs and be stars , we find that in the smc the two populations are consistent with each other , in contrast to the milky way populations ( in agreement with negueruela , 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , we find similar be spectral type distributions between the mcs samples , while we do not find evidence for differences between the mcs and the milky way .",
    "previous studies find the highest fraction of be stars at b2 spectral types ( e.g. martayan 2007b ) .",
    "mcbride ( 2008 ) find a spectral distribution cutoff for the smc be - xrbs around b2 and they suggest this might be due to significant angular - momentum losses , even before the be - xrb evolutionary phase ( i.e. during the first stage of mass transfer ) . ekstrm ( 2008 ) believe that the be - star phenomenon may be limited to a given spectral - type range because of the mass loss and the meridional currents . in particular , they argue that for spectral types earlier than the favored one , mass loss prevents the star from approaching the critical velocity limit ( at which the be - star phenomenon appears ) , while for the later spectral types , the meridional currents ( which transfer angular momentum to the surface ) are not efficient enough for accelerating the envelope .",
    "regarding the effects of metallicity in the fraction of be stars in a galaxy , it is now widely accepted that the lower the metallicity the higher this fraction , because of their higher rotational velocities ( e.g. maeder 1999 , wisniewski & bjorkman 2006 , martayan 2006b , 2007a ; after correcting for multi- and single - epoch observations for the milky way and the mcs , respectively ) .",
    "moreover , the be star phase can last longer in low metallicity environments such as the mcs when compared to the galaxy ( martayan 2007b ) .",
    "as pointed out in zorec & briot ( 1997 ) the observed populations of be stars suffer from many incompleteness effects , especially in faint magnitude limits .",
    "since the quantification of these selection effects is still in its infancy and depends on the used samples , we opted to use the available uncorrected samples and simply treat the number of stars at late spectral types as lower limits .",
    "this approach has lower discriminating power but it does not rely on modeling assumption about the selection effects .",
    "furthermore , the above samples include both field and cluster be star populations . in order to check",
    "if there are different spectral type distributions due to their different ages and rotational velocity characteristics , we examined 2 magellanic clouds samples which distinguish between them ( martayan 2007b and 2006b for the smc and the lmc , respectively ) .",
    "we do not find any difference in the spectral type distributions of be field and cluster populations , which could be due to the small size of these samples ( 79 and 52 be stars for the smc , and 27 and 20 for the lmc , respectively ) . in any case",
    ", in the present work we do not distinguish between the different be star populations , especially since all be - xrbs used in our study are located in the field .",
    "although there is a possibility that they were formed in clusters and then ejected due to supernova kicks , there is no way to test it .    from the above analysis it is obvious that in comparisons of the spectral - type distribution of different populations",
    ", one should keep in mind that the be phenomenon is a transient phase in the life of some b - type stars , greatly depending on the rotational velocity and perhaps binarity ( e.g. mcswain et al .",
    "because of the transient nature of the be - star disks , we may then get only a fraction of the real underlying be - star population with single - epoch observations , as is the majority in the smc .",
    "the orbital period of an xrb system is related to the size of its orbit , while the ew is considered an indicator of the size of the decretion disk ( e.g. , grundstrom & gies 2006 ; as observed by long baseline interferometry of nearby be stars ) . reig ( 1997 ) found a strong correlation between orbital period and ew , and attributed it to the presence of the neutron star , which appears to act as a barrier which prevents the formation of a extended disk in systems with short orbital period .",
    "figure [ ewporb ] is an updated version of the @xmath88-ew(h@xmath18 ) diagram for be - xrbs including in addition to the 15 galactic be - xrbs ( open circles ) used in the work of reig ( 2007 ) , 14 smc sources ( filled squares ) derived from the present work ( values are taken from table [ ewfwhm ] and references therein ) and 2 recently detected x - ray pulsars ( sxp7.78 , sxp455 ) .",
    "the orbital periods of these 2 sources are taken from liu ( 2005 ; and references therein ) , while for the ew measurements we used the work of coe ( 2005 ) . in figure [ ewporb ]",
    "we only included sources with well determined orbital periods , thus other smc x - ray pulsars ( such as sxp756 , sxp8.80 , sxp46.6 and sxp304 ) with published ew and values are not present .",
    "five x - ray sources ( out of the 20 used in section [ sptypediscuss ] ) do not have published orbital periods , thus they do not appear in this figure .",
    "source 4 - 1 is not included in figure [ ewporb ] because of its complicated nature ( coe 2002 ) .",
    "we also note that the ew measurements used here are the maximum found in the literature ( thus these measurements can be considered upper limits of the disk size ; e.g dachs 1992 ) .",
    "this plot strongly supports the correlation of these two quantities despite the large scatter observed for the shorter period systems and extends it to extragalactic systems . as reig ( 2007 )",
    "points out , the neutron star does not allow the companion star to develop a large decretion disk in cases of small orbital period systems , leading to the tidal truncation of the disk , and in turn smaller ew values .",
    "the values of the linear regression correlation coefficient for the smc , milky way and the combined sample are 0.71 , 0.89 , and 0.81 , respectively .",
    "thus , the smc sample ( solid line ) is less correlated when compared to the galactic sample ( dashed line ) , while the combined data sample ( dotted line ) shows a stronger correlation than the smc data alone because of the increased sample size .    from this plot",
    ", we also see that the smc sources tend to have systematically larger ew than galactic sources with similar orbital periods",
    ". this could be due to their faster rotational velocities ( a result of their lower metallicity , as observed for example by martayan 2007b ) and hence larger decretion disks .",
    "however , given the truncation effect discussed earlier , growing a larger disk would require a wider orbit which for the same orbital period would indicate a lower ellipticity .",
    "alternatively , a high mass - loss rate would allow a faster growth of the disk after the truncation .",
    "in addition to the ew , the @xmath89 color is also an indicator of the size of the circumstellar disk . by plotting these quantities , coe ( 2005 )",
    "find a similar range in the values of galactic be stars and smc be - xrbs , but not significant evidence for a correlation between the ew and the @xmath89 color for the be - xrbs . here",
    "we revisit this study using our extended census of be - xrbs and comparing with smc be stars from the study of ngc330 by martayan ( 2007a ) .",
    "the ews for the be - xrbs are taken from table [ ewfwhm ] and the j and k magnitudes from table [ 2dfoptids ] , corrected for reddening assuming e(j - k)=0.56e(b - v ) ( bessell & brett 1988 ) , and e(b - v)=0.09 mag ( following antoniou 2009 ) . the ew measurements for the ngc330 be stars are taken from martayan ( 2007a ) , while the @xmath89 color values are the result of the cross - correlation of the above census with the 2mass catalog .",
    "a comparison of these two quantities does not show any evidence for correlation , which we attribute to the fact that the ir and observations are not simultaneous , and thus the comparison between the two quantities is not direct .",
    "therefore , we do not pursue this comparison further .",
    "instead we focus on the individual distributions of the ew and ( j - k ) color .",
    "as shown in figures [ ewdistr ] and [ jko ] , respectively , the majority of the be - xrbs presented in this work have ews extending up to the mid range of the corresponding values for be stars , while both the be stars and the be - xrbs in the smc have similar values of the @xmath89 color .",
    "when we compare the results for the be - xrbs presented in this work with the study of coe ( 2005 ) , we find compatible values for the ews , however most of the sources in the present work have larger values of the @xmath89 color ( @xmath90 mag ; figure [ jko ] ) than those presented by coe ( 2005 ; @xmath91 mag ) .",
    "this can be the result of the different extinction correction in the two studies .",
    "we have used e(j - k)=0.05 , while coe ( 2005 ) corrected for all reddening effects by using the same color shift used for determining the spectral class of their objects ( shift by ( b - v)=-0.13 from their study ) .",
    "we then investigate the correlation of the ew measurements to the intrinsic reddening caused by the circumstellar disks around be stars .",
    "we define this  local \" reddening as the difference in the _ b - v _ color of the observed ( extinction corrected ) and theoretical values .",
    "the observed _ b - v _ color is taken from the mcps catalog of zaritsky 2002 ( since all the be - xrbs from the present study have an optical counterpart in this catalog ) after correcting for the extinction to the smc ( e(b - v)=0.09 ; see  [ 2dfoptcparts ] ) . in order to derive the theoretical",
    "_ b - v _ color , we first assign an effective temperature to each b subtype using the temperature scale for main - sequence b - type stars at the smc metallicity ( figure 33(d ) of hunter 2007 ) .",
    "we then derived the theoretical _ b - v _ color using the geneva isochrones database ( lejeune & schaerer 2001 ) assuming z=0.004 ( for the smc metallicity ) and the nearest corresponding available effective temperature to the one derived above .",
    "the ew versus intrinsic reddening plot is presented in figure [ localreddening ] , while the values of these quantities are given in table [ deltabv ] . in column 1",
    "we give the source i d , in column 2 the spectral classification from this study and in columns 3 and 4 the extinction corrected @xmath28 color and the corresponding error ( using data listed in table [ 2dfoptids ] ) , respectively . in column 5 we give the nearest b subtype to the classified sources used in order to derive the effective temperature . in column 6",
    "we give the _ b - v _ color from the isochrones , and in column 7 the intrinsic reddening ( extinction corrected photometric minus theoretical _ b - v _ values ) . in table [ deltabv ] and figure [ localreddening ] we did not include source 6 - 4 because its composite spectrum indicates that there might be more than one stars contributing to its emission . from this figure , we do not find any correlation between these two quantities , though they are both related to the decretion disk of the be star .",
    "the large scatter in the plot is mainly due to the fact that the theoretical values for the _ ( b - v ) _ color are in some degree uncertain .",
    "first , we had to assume a mean subtype for sources with uncertain spectral class ( e.g. x - ray sources 3 - 3 , 6 - 1 , 5 - 12 ) .",
    "then , we had to extrapolate the temperature scale of hunter ( 2007 ) to later than b1 spectral subtypes . and finally , we had to choose the nearest effective temperature derived above to the one used in the geneva database .",
    "all the above , in addition to disk inclination effects , can account , at least in part , for the large scatter of this plot , and may explain the fact that we do not find any correlation of the ew and the intrinsic reddening , though they are both related to the size of the circumstellar disk around be stars .",
    "we also note that even if we use the mean _ b - v _ color for each b subtype using data from evans ( 2004 ) , we do not find any correlation either .",
    "the fact that the spectroscopic and photometric observations are not simultaneous may also result in increased scatter .",
    "we have presented the results of a detailed optical spectroscopic analysis of 20 hmxbs in the smc .",
    "these sources have been detected with ( a. zezas 2009 , in preparation ) and _ xmm - newton _",
    "( haberl & pietsch 2004 ) . in the present work ,",
    "we confirm the be nature of all these systems .",
    "in addition , we provide their full wavelength range ( @xmath92 ) spectra .",
    "the classification of these 20 systems is accurate to better than @xmath48 subclass and is proved to be in good agreement with previous studies . in a few cases , only wide range spectral - types could be assigned , and for these systems higher resolution spectroscopy is needed in order to derive more accurate classifications .",
    "we also find similar spectral - type distributions for be - xrbs and be field stars in the smc . with the present available data we can not conclude that the be - xrbs in the smc and the milky way or the lmc follow a different spectral - type distribution .",
    "in addition , we find similar be spectral type distributions between the mcs samples , while we do not find evidence for differences between the mcs and the milky way .",
    "moreover , our results reinforce the relation between the orbital period and the equivalent width of the line that holds for be - xrbs .",
    "this relation is the result of truncated decretion disks in smaller period systems , due to the interaction of the compact object with the circumstellar disk of the be star . for similar orbital periods , smc sources tend to have systematically larger ew than galactic sources .",
    "this could be due to their faster rotational velocities ( a result of their lower metallicity , as observed for example by martayan 2007b ) and hence larger decretion disks .",
    "we also investigate the near - infrared properties of the 20 be - xrbs by cross - correlating their x - ray positions with sources in the 2mass catalog . for sources with a 2mass counterpart we do not find evidence for correlation of the ew values and the j - k color , though they are both related to the size of the decretion disk .",
    "the same holds for the ew values when compared to the intrinsic reddening of the sources ( defined as the observed minus the theoretical _ b - v _ color ) .",
    "we thank the referee , virginia mcswain , for useful comments which have improved this paper .",
    "we would also like to thank rob sharp for performing the 2df observations during service time and nolan walborn for fruitful discussions on the spectral classification .",
