    "a comparison of the x - ray and radio emission of young supernova remnants ( snrs ) provides a powerful tool for investigating the physical relationships among the thermal plasma , cosmic ray electrons and the magnetic field ( e.g. , ; ; ; ) .",
    "radio emission is governed primarily by the density of relativistic electrons and the magnetic field strength , while the intensity in soft x - rays is dictated by the gas density .",
    "shell snrs provide excellent laboratories for investigating the interaction among these physical processes , with casa being the natural launching point for such investigations , because of its high surface brightness in both the radio and x - ray wavelength regimes .",
    "previous work has shown that the soft x - ray morphology of casa , on angular scales @xmath130  ( or 0.5 pc at a distance of 3.4 kpc ) , is dominated by absorption effects ( , hereafter ) . when this absorption is taken into account , a higher degree of intrinsic correlation between the x - ray and radio images",
    "is found . similarly , found a correlation between the radio and the hard x - ray ( @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4kev ) surface brightness , which is not affected by absorption .",
    "these correlations demonstrate that a simple relationship may exist among the underlying physical parameters .",
    "in this letter we investigate the relationship between the radio and x - ray emission on smaller angular scales .",
    "we use a newly acquired rosat high resolution imager ( hri ) image of casa , with a 40 times longer exposure than used in . to account for the inhomogeneous column density towards casa , we `` deabsorb '' the image using h  i and oh absorption data (  [ deabsorption.sec ] ) .",
    "we perform a point by point ( 4  resolution ) surface brightness comparison between the x - ray and radio images and find a statistically significant correlation (  [ radio_comparison.sec ] ) .",
    "we discuss the physical implications of this correlation (  [ discussion ] ) and its implications for future observational and theoretical studies of casa and other young snrs (  [ conclusion ] ) .",
    "deep rosat hri exposures of the snr casa were obtained on december 23 , 1995 and june 20 , 1996 , with the telescope optical axis pointed toward the center of the remnant . the standard processing yields a total of 232ks of acceptable observing time , which produces the highest dynamic range ( 500:1 ) x - ray image of casa to date . a final image , shown in fig .",
    "[ raw_image ] , was made by cross - correlating and adding images from the two exposures , using the radio image as an absolute reference .    in order to reduce instrumental blurring ( e.g.  the hri `` halo '' ) we applied 5 iterations of the lucy - richardson restoration technique (; ) . as a kernel for the deconvolution",
    ", we used an on - axis analytical radially symmetric point spread function ( psf ) , which is valid because the psf is approximately constant across the 5  extent of casa .",
    "the resolution of the final image was estimated to be about 4  ( 0.07 pc ) .",
    "+     +     +    to correct any systematic scaling errors that may have been produced by the restoration process , we used a 4  fwhm gaussian smoothed version of the raw image to rescale the reconstructed image .",
    "this required a linear transformation with a scale of 0.92 and an insignificant zero - offset ( 0.31 cts / beam ) .",
    "this new image of casa is the first with enough sensitivity to reveal x - ray features , on small angular scales ( @xmath5 ) and low surface brightness ( @xmath6ctss@xmath7()@xmath8 ) , which have been only previously detected in the radio .",
    "many of the most striking of these features are outside the bright shell , such as the northern and southern knots and the eastern jet region . to enhance this outlying structure , we show a spatially filtered version of the image ( fig .",
    "[ filtered_image ] ) , produced by dividing the 4  x - ray image by a 60  gaussian smoothed version of itself .",
    "this effectively removes large scale structure and enhances regions away from the bright ring .",
    "the large scale differences between casa s soft x - ray and radio morphology are dominated by foreground absorption effects ( ) . in order to take these effects into account , we used h  i and oh absorption data (; ) , which trace the foreground atomic and molecular gas respectively .",
    "we translated these data into an optical depth map using the empirical relation ( specific to casa ) for each resolution element : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is casa s optical depth over the rosat hri bandpass , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the h  i and oh equivalent widths respectively .",
    "a complete description of this method is given in .",
    "using this hri - specific 30  resolution optical depth map , we produced the deabsorbed x - ray image of casa shown in fig .",
    "[ deabsorbed_image ] . absorption structure on scales between 30  and 4  could affect our results , but the oh data of suggest that clouds of scales 3060  dominate the absorption structure .",
    "the brightest features in the x - ray and radio maps are for the most part not correlated . however , when viewed on logarithmic scales , the deabsorbed x - ray map and the radio map appear quite similar ( fig .",
    "[ log_images ] ) . in order to quantify this similarity",
    ", we performed a point - by - point comparison between the deabsorbed x - ray image and the most recent ( epoch 1994 ) @xmath13 vla map ( ) .",
    "the time differences between the radio and x - ray observations ( @xmath141  year ) will have no effect , given that typical proper motions in casa are of order @xmath15 ( ) .",
    "figure  [ radio_v_xray ] shows this correlation for 4  pixels .",
    "this relationship has a correlation coefficient of r@xmath160.75 , and appears to be real but scatter - dominated .",
    "we can parameterize the relationship between the deabsorbed x - ray surface brightness ( @xmath17 ) and the radio surface brightness ( @xmath18 ) as @xmath19 to find the value of @xmath20 , we performed a least - squares analysis between the quantities @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we found the bisector between the two standard least - squares fits , as is appropriate for a scatter dominated linear correlation between two physical quantities ( . at 4  binning",
    "we find a best - fit @xmath23 with a corresponding variance of @xmath24 .",
    "monte carlo simulations by  suggest that their formula for finding the variance in the slope underestimates the true uncertainty by about 10% , so we have set our `` 90% confidence '' errors ( table  [ eta_scale.tab ] ) to the @xmath25 level .",
    "we performed two simple tests to show that neither the correlation nor the scatter are artifacts of our analysis .",
    "first , to show that the correlation is intrinsic to the data , we rotated one image by 180  about casa s geometrical center before re - correlating the data , whereby the correlation coefficient dropped from @xmath26=0.75 to @xmath26=0.41 .",
    "this implies that the correlation is due to small scale structure , and is not simply a byproduct of casa s overall circular morphology .",
    "second , to show the reality of the scatter , we created a simulated x - ray map , by assigning to each pixel an x - ray surface brightness that combined the radio surface brightness of that pixel scaled by a power law of 2.21 , plus a random term representing the poisson scatter in the x - ray map .",
    "the correlation between the radio and the simulated x - ray image showed no significant scatter , implying that the scatter in figure  [ radio_v_xray ] due to statistical fluctuations is small compared with that observed .",
    "possible physical explanations for this scatter are discussed in  [ scatter_dis ] .",
    "we performed the correlation analysis described above on maps with successively larger bin sizes in order to investigate the robustness of our analysis and investigate how increasing the pixel size affects the value of @xmath20 ( table  [ eta_scale.tab ] ) .",
    "as the data are binned , the best - fit @xmath20 decreases , but its maximum value remains at about @xmath27 .    to illustrate how smoothing could bias the measured values of @xmath20 , assume that there exists a value @xmath28@xmath3@xmath29 , such that @xmath30 . thus the averaged quantities would be subject to the inequality : @xmath31 one possible explanation for the decreasing @xmath20 with resolution is that this bias affects both the dim and bright parts of casa to about the same degree ; however in proportion to their average brightness the dimmer regions are affected to a greater degree , so our logarithmic fitting returns a flatter slope @xmath20 .",
    "another possibility is that the binning of data lowers the dynamic range of the fit , thus skewing @xmath20 towards its uncorrelated value of unity .",
    "a third possible explanation is that smoothing increases the importance of path - length variations as the governing physical parameter , thus also skewing @xmath20 towards unity .",
    "regardless of the particular explanation , the trend shown in table  [ eta_scale.tab ] suggests that the intrinsic value of @xmath20 is between 2.2 and 2.3 .",
    "+     +     +    .the x - ray / radio regression parameters [ cols=\">,>,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + n = the number of independent points + r = the correlation coefficient + @xmath20 = the log - log surface brightness slope ( see equation  [ eta_def.eqn ] ) with 90% confidence errors + [ eta_scale.tab ]      figure  [ residuals ] is a map of the quantity @xmath32 , or a measure of deviations from the best - fit slope @xmath20 . consistent with an overall physical correlation , this map shows very little structure .",
    "there are no large scale features such as the shell or the western hot spot .",
    "a few key features are present , however . some are relatively radio bright : the northern knot region ; a knot near the center ; and the outlying structure in the south .",
    "in addition , there is a relatively x - ray bright feature on the eastern shell .",
    "the main objective of comparing the x - ray and radio emission in casa is to identify the physical relationships among the thermal plasma , cosmic ray electrons and magnetic field . in this section",
    "we show that our results are consistent with proportionate partition between the energy content of the gas and magnetic field .",
    "we also develop a physical justification for this by postulating a turbulent magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) plasma , which we argue is continuously amplifying the magnetic field . as both the trend and",
    "the exceptions are real , this scenario should be interpreted as valid `` on average , '' but not necessarily for each feature in casa .    the rosat band spectrum of casa is dominated by line emission from h and he - like ions of mg and si and the l - shell ions of fe ( ) .",
    "thus by assuming a constant temperature plasma , we can relate the x - ray emissivity , is defined in an analogous way to the radio emissivity , such that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the path length . ]",
    "( @xmath35 ) to the gas density ( @xmath36 ) as : @xmath37    casa s radio emission mechanism is believed to be synchrotron radiation ( ) , arising from relativistic electrons ( of density @xmath38 ) interacting with the magnetic field ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "we therefore characterize the radio emissivity ( @xmath40 ) as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the radio spectral index ( @xmath43 , ) .    concluded that the radio brightness of the compact features in casa is governed primarily by magnetic field amplification . for this reason ,",
    "we believe it reasonable to assume a constant ( or uncorrelated ) relativistic electron density .",
    "therefore , equation [ radio_emissivity.eqn ] becomes : @xmath44    in their mhd simulations , show that rayleigh - taylor ( r - t ) instabilities in young snrs are significantly enhanced by the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , created by the shear flow along the r - t fingers , greatly enhance the magnetic field  especially on small scales .",
    "in addition , mhd studies of simple shear systems show that the magnetic field is amplified quickly as the energy cascades to smaller scales . on the scale where the magnetic field becomes dynamically important ,",
    "reconnection and dissipation occur .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the magnetic field in casa is being amplified to the point of equipartition with the hot gas , locally on the smallest observable scales , so : @xmath45 in aggregate this is approximately true .",
    "if one assumes equipartition between the magnetic field and the relativistic plasma , an energy density for each of these can be derived simply from the overall radio flux density . this overall magnetic energy density ( @xmath46 )",
    "is comparable to the thermal energy density ( @xmath47 ) estimated from the integrated asca x - ray spectrum ( allen , g.e .",
    "_ private communication _ ) .",
    "this suggestion of equipartition is apparently incompatible with the simulation of , whose 3-d simulations predicted magnetic fields significantly lower than equipartition .",
    "however , they also found that the higher the resolution of the simulation ( i.e. , the lower effective viscosity ) , the greater the resultant magnetic field . with regard to the analysis presented here , this distinction is moot .",
    "if the turbulent cascade is halted on the smallest scales by the magnetic pressure , the equipartition relation ( equation  [ equipartition.eqn ] ) should hold . on the other hand , if the turbulent cascade is the primary amplifier of the magnetic field , but is halted before the magnetic field reaches equipartition , then one would expect the system to still be in proportionate partition , i.e. : @xmath48 the analysis presented here can not distinguish between equipartition ( equation  [ equipartition.eqn ] ) and the looser constraint of proportionate partition ( equation  [ proportionate_partition.eqn ] ) . similarly , it does not matter here whether @xmath47 represents the turbulent energy density or the thermal energy density , so long as the energy density scales linearly , on average , with the gas density ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we now combine equations [ xray_emissivity.eqn ] , [ radio_emissivity_simple.eqn ] and [ proportionate_partition.eqn ] to find a relationship between the x - ray and radio emissivities : @xmath50 this simple relationship agrees remarkably with the value of @xmath20 found in  [ radio_comparison.sec ] .",
    "a similar and independent conclusion about turbulent magnetic field amplification was found by , who examined the changes in casa s radio emission as a function of azimuth over an 11 year baseline .",
    "they found that regions with the largest decrease in fractional polarization ( corresponding to a decrease in order of the magnetic field ) are decreasing the least in flux density .",
    "they suggest that the same process which is randomizing the magnetic field s orientation is also amplifying it , partially compensating for expansion losses .",
    "this relationship between the radio and x - ray surface brightness is very different from the predictions of most other simple models .",
    "for example , in an isobaric model , the magnetic pressure and thermal pressure add to a constant , so the surface brightnesses would be anti - correlated .",
    "more realistically , a compression scenario where the magnetic field scales inversely with area",
    "so @xmath51 , implies that @xmath52 , which is also inconsistent with the data .",
    "if instead , we make the equally simple assumption that the relativistic electron density is proportional to the thermal gas density ( @xmath53 ) , then we find @xmath54 .",
    "while we can not completely rule out this possibility , we do not favor it .",
    "the larmor radii of the relativistic electrons are very small ( @xmath14@xmath55 cm for a 1gev particle in a 1 mg magnetic field ) , tightly coupling them to magnetic field lines , which in turn are coupled to the plasma .",
    "this suggests that @xmath56 may be a good assumption , but then one would also expect a relation between the magnetic field and density .",
    "when a magnetic field dependence is included , @xmath20 is significantly reduced .",
    "for example , if @xmath57 then @xmath58 , which is clearly inconsistent with the correlation .",
    "the simple model that fits the surface brightness ratio rests on three assumptions : constant relativistic electron density , constant x - ray emissivity per density squared ( @xmath59 ) , and proportionate partition .",
    "the relative flatness of the ratio map shows that deviations from these assumptions on large scales are absent .",
    "it is plausible , however , that the substantial scatter of the ratio for individual cells from the trend line represents local violation of one or more of these assumptions .",
    "the log of the rms deviation about the trend line is @xmath600.38 ( a factor of @xmath142.5 ) ; the log of the maximum excursion is @xmath601.5 .",
    "if the scatter is due entirely to variations of @xmath38 or @xmath61 ( proportionate partition ) , we find the corresponding rms variation of these is @xmath600.17 in the log , or a factor of @xmath141.5 .",
    "the x - ray emissivity is a function of both gas temperature and metal abundance",
    ". the emissivity scales linearly with the abundance of the metals producing the dominant lines in the rosat band , namely mg and si ; thus local rms variations of a factor of @xmath142.5 in metallicity can account for the scatter .",
    "the emissivity scales with temperature in a less straightforward way , but deviations of @xmath62 of @xmath600.4 can be accounted for by log(kt ) variations of @xmath600.4 .",
    "scatter of the degree indicated in any of these parameters is physically plausible .",
    "for instance , small scale gas pressure variations associated with a shock encountering a density enhancement can be as large as a factor of 6 ( ) , which in turn could produce variations of b@xmath63 or @xmath64 within the observed range .",
    "measurements of any of these parameters on small angular scales , at best pose a challenge to current and future instruments , and at worst may be infeasible to measure ( e.g. , n@xmath65 ) .",
    "we have performed a comparison of casa s radio and x - ray emission to a limiting resolution of 4  ( 0.07 pc ) . the strong correlation between radio and x - ray surface brightness",
    "can be explained by the scenario that casa has `` on average '' a spatially constant relativistic electron density and proportionate partition on small scales between its thermal and magnetic energy densities , as would be expected from a fully turbulent mhd system .",
    "these results may have important implications for theoretical work .",
    "the complex plasma physics of snrs often must be simplified in order for computer simulations to run in a cost - effective manner .",
    "unfortunately , most often one assumption is spherical or cylindrical symmetry , which is incompatible with turbulent flow .",
    "it may be possible , instead , to use the proportionate partition relation suggested by our result , along with some other characteristics of fully turbulent systems , to produce a more realistic first - order description of young , core - collapse , supernova remnants .",
