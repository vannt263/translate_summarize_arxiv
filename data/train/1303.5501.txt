    "a new galactic emission mechanism , commonly referred to as anomalous microwave emission  ( ame ) , has been observed by a number of experiments aimed at measuring fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background  ( cmb ) in the frequency range 10    100  ghz  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "studies over the last decade have shown that ame is prevalent in a variety of galactic environments such as molecular clouds  @xcite , dark clouds  @xcite , hii regions  @xcite , and in the diffuse interstellar medium  @xcite .",
    "ame has also been detected within a star forming region in the external galaxy ngc  6946  @xcite .",
    "the ame is observed as an excess of emission at cm wavelengths above the other galactic emission mechanisms and is expected to be a substantial contaminant to the cmb in the frequency range 10    100  ghz .",
    "hence , it is of critical importance that we completely comprehend the physical emission mechanism involved .",
    "the current favored explanation for the source of this emission is electric dipole radiation originating from rapidly rotating very small dust grains  @xcite .",
    "interstellar dust grains are responsible for the mid- to far - infrared  ( ir ) emission , which is generally thought to be produced by a combination of stochastic and thermal equilibrium emission processes .",
    "the stochastic emission observed at mid - ir wavelengths  ( @xmath1  3  ",
    "70  @xmath0 m ) is generated by emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  ( pahs ) and a population of small carbonaceous dust grains , while larger silicate dust grains are responsible for the thermal equilibrium emission at far - ir wavelengths  ( @xmath3  70  @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the spinning dust hypothesis implies that there is an intrinsic link between the ame and the stochastic emission observed in the mid - ir as both are produced by small interstellar dust grains .",
    "if the spinning dust mechanism proves to be correct , then ame studies represent a new window in which to probe small interstellar dust grains and the physics involved .    in this analysis",
    "we focus on a known region of ame in the vicinity of the perseus molecular cloud .",
    "the dust feature g159.6 - 18.5 has previously been studied and found to exhibit ame on angular scales of  @xmath1  1  degree  @xcite and  @xmath1  10  arcmin  @xcite . also , a recent study performed by  @xcite used ir observations of the region to characterize the dust properties and investigate the physical conditions in which the ame is observed . in this work ,",
    "we present new observations of the perseus molecular cloud performed with the arcminute microkelvin imager  ( ami ) small array  ( sa ) .",
    "these observations represent the highest angular resolution observations of this region at microwave wavelengths to date , and allow us to investigate the ame on angular scales of  @xmath1  2  arcmin , providing further insight into the physical processes producing the ame .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] describes the data used in this analysis and in section  [ sec : corr ] we investigate the correlation between the microwave and ir emission . in section  [ sec : discuss ] we discuss the results of this investigation and we present our conclusions in section  [ sec : con ] .",

    "20  m and operates in eight 0.75  ghz channels over the frequency range 12  ",
    "18  ghz  @xcite .",

    "the ami sa has a typical system temperature of  @xmath4  25  k , and the point source sensitivity of the array is  @xmath4  30  mjy  s@xmath5 , which corresponds to  @xmath4  0.2  mjy over an 8  hour observing run . observations of g159.6 - 18.5 were performed throughout june and july 2010 , with a total of seven individual pointings  ( see table  [ table : summary - sa ] ) .",
    "the location of the pointings was chosen to coincide with both the ame features previously observed with the very small array  ( vsa ) at 33  ghz on angular scales of  @xmath1  10  arcmin  @xcite , and the small scale structure present in the mid - ir _ spitzer _ maps of the region  @xcite .",

    "data reduction was performed using the reduce software package .",
    "reduce was specifically designed for ami observations and automatically flags interference , shadowing , and hardware errors , applies path delay corrections and performs phase and flux density calibrations .",
    "phase calibration was performed using observations of j0359 + 3220 , while flux density calibration was performed using short observations of 3c48 .",
    "the reduced data were imaged using the aips data package .",
    "the task imagr was used to perform both the fourier transform and deconvolution for all of the pointings . this task uses a clean based algorithm to perform the deconvolution and we implemented a briggs robust parameter of 0 , which provides a compromise between uniform and natural weighting , and a small loop gain to help retain the extended emission .",
    "this resulted in seven clean maps , one for each pointing , and the r.m.s .",
    "noise in each of these maps is listed in table  [ table : summary - sa ] .",
    "these seven pointings were primary beam corrected and combined to produce a mosaic of the region as displayed in figure  [ fig : ami_mos ] .",
    "the half power point of the ami sa primary beam is  @xmath4  20  arcmin at 16  ghz , and the mean ami sa synthesized beam  ( fwhm ) for these observations is 2.6  @xmath6  2.1  arcmin@xmath7 at 16  ghz .",

    "this illustrates the location of the ami sa pointings relative to both the ame previously detected and the small scale dust features in this region .",

    "figure  [ fig : radio ] displays the nvss map of g159.6 - 18.5 overlaid with the ami sa contours .",
    "we find three point sources in the ami sa mosaic , all of which correspond to a source in the nvss 1.4  ghz map .",
    "these sources , which are highlighted in figure  [ fig : radio ] , are listed in table  [ table : radio_sources ] along with the measured flux density at 16  ghz .",
    "the errors include a fitting error combined in quadrature with a 5  % calibration uncertainty .",
    "the location of these sources is such that they do not contaminate the bulk of the extended emission observed in the ami sa map .",
    "it is also apparent that there is a significant lack of correlation between the emission observed with the ami sa at 16  ghz and the 1.4  ghz emission , which suggests that the source of the emission in the ami sa mosaic is not originating from either free - free or synchrotron emission .",
    "based on observations performed on both  @xmath1  1  degree and  @xmath1  10  arcmin angular scales , the ame accounts for  @xmath1  80  % of the cm emission in g159.6 - 18.5  @xcite .",

    "ir correlation in g159.6 - 18.5 at higher angular resolution than has been performed previously . in figures  [ fig : spitzer_maps_irac ] and  [ fig : spitzer_maps_mips ] we display g159.6 - 18.5 with the ami sa contours overlaid on the _ spitzer _ maps at 5.8 , 8 , 24 , 70 , and 160  @xmath0 m .",

    "however , since the ami sa is an interferometer most of the extended emission is resolved out , and therefore the ami sa data and the _ spitzer _ data can not be compared directly . to overcome this issue , the _ spitzer",
    "_ data must be resampled with the ami sa sampling distribution to account for the incomplete _ u , v _ coverage .",
    "this task was performed using the aips routine uvsub , which applies the ami sa sampling distribution to the _ spitzer _ data .",
    "after resampling the _ spitzer _ data , a pearson correlation analysis was performed in the image plane between the ami sa map and the five resampled _ spitzer _ maps . before performing the correlation ,",
    "all the maps were regridded to a common 1  arcmin pixel grid to ensure the data obeyed the nyquist sampling theorem , which ensures that each pixel represents approximately independent data points .",
    "all six maps  ( see figure  [ fig : resampled_spitzer ] ) were then trimmed to ensure that only the sky coverage common to all the maps was included in the analysis .",
    "this also ensures that any artificial edge effects due to the fourier transform do not bias the correlation .",
    "as we are only interested in the extended emission , the three sources identified in section  [ subsec : radio ] were masked and excluded from the rest of this analysis .",
    "the results of the correlation analysis are displayed in figure  [ fig : correlation ] , which plots the pearson correlation coefficient as a function of wavelength .",
    "all uncertainties on the correlation coefficients were estimated using the fisher @xmath11 to @xmath12 transformation  @xcite , and computing the 68  % confidence interval .",
    "the results of the pearson correlation analysis displayed in figure  [ fig : correlation ] , and listed in table  [ table : corr_coef ] , show a clear peak in the correlation at 24  @xmath0 m at a statistical level of 6.7@xmath2 . in absolute terms , the peak at 24  @xmath0 m , with a correlation coefficient of 0.46  @xmath9  0.02 , is not a particularly strong correlation , however , as we discuss later , what is interesting is how the relative correlation coefficients vary as a function of wavelength .",
    "in addition to the peak in the correlation at 24  @xmath0 m , we find that even if we ignore the 24  @xmath0 m data point , there is a hint  ( 1.4@xmath2 ) of a non - zero correlation between the pearson correlation coefficients and the ir wavelengths , which increases at shorter wavelengths .",
    "this result tentatively implies that the ame is more correlated with the shorter ir wavelengths , and it is possible to observe this effect by looking at figure  [ fig : resampled_spitzer ] where the correlation is clearly stronger with the shorter ir wavelengths .",
    "the shorter ir wavelength emission is due to stochastically heated , small dust grains , and this result suggests that the ame is more strongly correlated with the smaller dust grains , which is consistent with the spinning dust hypothesis , where only the smallest dust grains can spin at the frequencies required to produce the observed ame .",

    ". however , these objects would appear bright and point - like in the ami sa map , and as shown in section  [ subsec : radio ] , there are only three point sources identified in the ami sa map .",
    "these three sources are all extragalactic radio sources , and as stated in section  [ sec : corr ] , they were masked for the correlation analysis , thereby ruling out any possible contamination from uchii regions .    to further investigate the microwave",
    "  ir correlation , we repeated the pearson correlation analysis .",
    "however , this time we performed the analysis separately for each of the sub regions within g159.6 - 18.5 to allow us to better understand how the microwave    ir correlation varies throughout the cloud .",
    "the results of the correlation analysis performed on these sub regions are displayed in figure  [ fig : correlation_subregions ] , and tabulated in table  [ table : corr_coef ] , and show that there is a clear variation in the microwave  ",
    "ir correlation throughout the entire region .    for regions",
    "a and b , the correlation increases from 160 to 70  @xmath0 m and peaks at 24  @xmath0 m before falling sharply to 8 and 5.8  @xmath0 m .",
    "this is similar to what was found for the entire mosaic .",
    "region c shows a flat correlation from 160 to 24  @xmath0 m , with a non - significant peak at 70  @xmath0 m .",
    "this implies that the large dust grains and the small dust grains must be well mixed in this region .",
    "however , as is seen in regions a and b , in region c the correlation falls at 8 and 5.8  @xmath0 m . for region",
    "d , the correlation increases from 160 to 70  @xmath0 m , then decreases at 24  @xmath0 m , before rising again at 8 and 5.8  @xmath0 m .",
    "region d corresponds to the central region of the shell of g159.6 - 18.5 containing the b0 v star hd  278942 , which is thought to be responsible for the entire shell - like structure . as discussed by  @xcite , due to the presence of this star , this region",
    "is dominated by a very hot dust component that can be seen in the 24  @xmath0 m _ spitzer _ map .",
    "it is therefore likely that the emission at 24  @xmath0 m from this region is not due to stochastically heated small dust grains , but is in fact due to thermal emission of large dust grains which have been heated to such temperatures that cause it to emit at 24  @xmath0 m .",
    "this would therefore explain the lack of correlation between the microwave emission and the 24  @xmath0 m emission in this region .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] +    one interesting result is that the correlation does not appear to peak at 5.8 or 8  @xmath0 m for any of the sub regions , with the exception of region d , but even this does not show a strong peak .",
    "in fact , we find that for regions a , b , and c , the correlation actually decreases from 24  @xmath0 m to 8 and 5.8  @xmath0 m .",
    "these results are consistent with the results found for the entire region , which shows a stronger correlation at 24  @xmath0 m than at either 5.8 or 8  @xmath0 m . assuming that contamination from spectral lines is negligible , the irac 5.8 and 8  @xmath0 m bands , which cover the wavelength of known pah features at 6.2 and 7.7  @xmath0 m , are expected to trace the pah emission , while the 24  @xmath0 m emission is due to stochastically heated small dust grains . the fact that we do not find a peak in the correlation at 5.8 or 8  @xmath0 m , but actually at 24  @xmath0 m , appears to suggest that the ame is originating from a population of small dust grains rather than pahs .",
