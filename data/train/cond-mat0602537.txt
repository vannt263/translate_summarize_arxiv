    "systems with strong electron correlations which , in particular , cuprate perovskites belong to are characterized by a coulomb repulsion that is comparable to or larger than hopping constants .",
    "one of the simplest models for the description of such systems is the hubbard model @xcite with the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the hopping constants , the operator @xmath4 creates an electron on the site * n * with the spin projection @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the on - site coulomb repulsion and the electron number operator @xmath7 . in the case of strong electron correlations , @xmath8",
    ", it is reasonable to use a perturbation expansion in powers of the hopping constants for investigating hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "apparently the first such expansion was considered in reference  @xcite .",
    "the further development of this approach was given in references  @xcite where the diagram technique for hubbard operators was developed and used for investigating the mott transition , the magnetic phase diagram and the superconducting transition in the hubbard model .",
    "the rules of the diagram technique for hubbard operators are rather intricate . besides , these rules and the graphical representation of the expansion vary depending on the choice of the operator precedence . the diagram technique suggested in references  @xcite is free from these defects . in this approach",
    "the power expansion for green s function of electron operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 is considered and the terms of the expansion are expressed as site cumulants of these operators . based on this diagram technique the equations of the larkin type @xcite for green s function were derived @xcite .    however , the application of this approach runs into problems . in particular , at half - filling the spectral weight obtained after a resummation of diagrams appears to be negative near frequencies @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this drawback is connected with divergencies in cumulants at these frequencies @xcite . as can be seen from formulas given below",
    ", all higher - order cumulants have such divergencies at @xmath12 with sign - changing residues , which are expected to compensate the negative spectral weight in the entire series . on the other hand , at frequencies neighboring to @xmath12 cumulants are regular .",
    "if a selected subset of diagrams is expected to give a correct estimate of the entire series for these frequencies the values at @xmath12 can be corrected by an interpolation using results for the regular regions .",
    "this procedure was applied in reference  @xcite for the case of two dimensions , half - filling , nearest - neighbor hopping and with the use of the one - loop approximation .",
    "the spectrum was shown to consist of four bands .",
    "these band structure and the calculated shapes of the electron spectral function are close to those obtained in the monte - carlo @xcite , cluster perturbation @xcite and the two - particle self - consistent @xcite calculations .",
    "the four - band structure of the spectrum of the hubbard model was also considered in reference  @xcite .    in the approach of reference",
    "@xcite the mentioned four - band structure of the spectrum at half - filling has its origin in the regions of large damping which separate the low- and high - frequency bands .",
    "in the major part of the brillouin zone both these types of the bands owe their origin to the same terms of the irreducible part , i.e.  to the same interaction processes .",
    "this brings up the questions : how this spectrum is changed with filling and how the quasiparticle peak , which determines the photoemission leading edge , arises in the spectrum ? as expected , this peak differs in nature from other spectral features . in the present work it is shown that on certain deviation from half - filling an additional narrow band arises near the fermi level on the background of the four above - mentioned bands .",
    "the dispersion of the new band , its bandwidth and the variation with filling are close to those of the spin - polaron band in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model @xcite .    in the following section the perturbation expansion for the electron green s function is formulated in the form convenient for calculations and larkin s equation",
    "is derived . in sec .",
    "iii the equations of the previous section are used for calculating the spectral function and the obtained results are discussed . concluding remarks are presented in sec",
    "we consider green s function @xmath13 where the angular brackets denote the statistical averaging with the hamiltonian @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the chemical potential , @xmath16 is the time - ordering operator which arranges other operators from right to left in ascending order of times @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "choosing @xmath20 as the unperturbed hamiltonian and the perturbation , respectively , and using the known expansion @xcite for the evolution operator we get @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the inverse temperature , the subscript `` 0 '' near the angular bracket indicates that the averaging and time dependencies of operators are determined with the hamiltonian @xmath23 .",
    "the subscript `` c '' indicates that terms which split into two or more disconnected averages have to be dropped out .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath23 is diagonal in the site representation .",
    "therefore the average in the right - hand side of equation  ( [ series ] ) splits into averages belonging to separate lattice sites . to be nonzero",
    "these latter averages have to contain equal number of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "let us consider the average which appears in the first order : @xmath24 ( for short here and below subscripts `` 0 '' and `` c '' are omitted ) .",
    "for this average to be nonvanishing operators have to belong either to the same site or to two different sites , @xmath25 the multiplier @xmath26 ensures that @xmath27 in the two last terms ( the case @xmath28 is taken into account by the first term in the right - hand side ) .",
    "after the rearrangement of the terms we find @xmath29 where @xmath30 are cumulants @xcite of the first and second order , respectively .",
    "all operators in cumulants  ( [ cumulants ] ) belong to the same lattice site . due to the translational symmetry of @xmath23 in equation  ( [ division ] )",
    "the cumulants do not depend on the site index which is therefore omitted in equation  ( [ cumulants ] ) .",
    "i0.6        averages which appear in higher - order terms of equation  ( [ series ] ) can be transformed in the same manner .",
    "the average in the @xmath31-th order term which contains @xmath32 creation and annihilation operators is represented by the sum of all possible products of cumulants with the sum of orders equal to @xmath32 .",
    "all possible distributions of operators between the cumulants in these products have to be taken into account .",
    "the sign of a term in this sum is determined by the number of permutations of fermion operators , which bring the sequence of operators in the initial average to that in the term .",
    "actually the above statements determine rules of the diagram technique .",
    "additionally we have to take into account the presence of topologically equivalent terms  terms which differ only by permutation of operators @xmath33 in equation  ( [ series ] ) .",
    "since these terms are equal , in the expansion only one of them can be taken into account with the prefactor @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of topologically equivalent terms . following reference  @xcite in diagrams",
    "we denote a cumulant by a circle and the hopping constant @xmath36 by a line directed from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "the external operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 are denoted by directed lines leaving from and entering into a cumulant .",
    "the order of a cumulant is equal to a number of incoming or outgoing lines .",
    "summations and integrations over the internal indices @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are carried out . since site indices of operators included in a cumulant coincide , some site summations disappear . also some summations over @xmath43 get lost , because in any cumulant spin indices of creation and annihilation operators have to match .",
    "taking into account the multiplier @xmath45 in equation  ( [ series ] ) , the sign of the diagram is equal to @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of loops formed by hopping lines .",
    "figure  [ fig_i ] demonstrates connected diagrams of the first four orders of the power expansion  ( [ series ] ) with their signs and prefactors . here",
    "the thick line with arrow in the left - hand side of the equation is the total green s function .",
    "notice that if we set @xmath48 , contributions of the diagrams ( b ) , ( d)(f ) , ( i)(n ) , ( p ) , ( t ) , and ( u ) vanish .",
    "however , below a renormalized hopping parameter will be introduced which is nonzero for coinciding site indices and therefore the mentioned diagrams are retained in figure  [ fig_i ] .",
    "all diagrams can be separated into two categories  those which can be divided into two parts by cutting some hopping line and those which can not be divided in this way @xcite .",
    "these latter diagrams are referred to as irreducible diagrams . in figure",
    "[ fig_i ] the diagrams ( c ) , ( e ) , ( f ) , ( h ) , ( j ) , ( k ) , ( n ) , ( p ) , and ( r)(v ) belong to the first category , while the others are from the second category .",
    "the former diagrams can be constructed from the irreducible diagrams by connecting them with hopping lines .",
    "notice that a prefactor @xmath49 of some composite diagram is the product of prefactors of its irreducible parts [ cf . ,",
    "e.g. , the irreducible diagrams ( a ) , ( d ) and the composed diagrams ( j ) , ( k ) in figure  [ fig_i ] ] .",
    "if we denote the sum of all irreducible diagrams as @xmath50 , the equation for green s function can be written as @xmath51 this equation has the form of the larkin equation @xcite .",
    "the partial summation can be carried out in the hopping lines of cumulants by inserting the irreducible diagrams into these lines . in doing",
    "so the hopping constant @xmath36 in the respective formulas is substituted by @xmath52 for the diagram ( b ) in figure  [ fig_i ] inserting irreducible diagrams into the hopping line leads to the diagrams ( g ) , ( m ) , and ( q ) .    due to the translation and time invariance of the problem",
    "the quantities in equations  ( [ larkin ] ) and  ( [ hopping ] ) depend only on differences of site indices and times .",
    "the use of the fourier transformation @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the matsubara frequency , simplifies significantly these equations : @xmath55    in the approximation used below the total collection of irreducible diagrams @xmath56 is substituted by the sum of the two simplest diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) appearing in the first two orders of the perturbation theory . due to the form of the latter diagram this approximation",
    "is referred to as the one - loop approximation . in the diagram ( b ) the hopping line is renormalized in accordance with equation  ( [ thopping ] ) .",

    "now we need to calculate the cumulants in equation  ( [ approx ] ) . to do this",

    "the hubbard operators are connected by the relations @xmath71 with the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the commutation relations for the hubbard operators are easily derived from their definition . using equation  ( [ hubbard ] ) the first cumulant in equation  ( [ cumulants ] )",

    "the substitution of equation  ( [ hubbard ] ) in @xmath93 in @xmath76 , equation  ( [ cumulants ] ) , leads to six nonvanishing averages of hubbard operators ( such averages are nonzero if the numbers of the operators @xmath80 and @xmath94 coincide in them , and the same is true for the pair @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) .",
    "applying wick s theorem ( [ wick ] ) to these averages the number of operators in them is sequentially decreased until only time - independent operators are left . for @xmath23 in equation  ( [ division ] ) these are @xmath85 , @xmath87 , and @xmath86 .",

    "the peaks near @xmath130 are more intensive than those near @xmath125 and are located in the nearest vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "for @xmath129 the width of the band formed by the former peaks is comparable to the superexchange constant @xmath151 of the effective heisenberg model which describes magnetic excitations in the limit @xmath152 .",
    "this indicates obviously the participation of the spin excitations in the formation of these band states .",
    "the bandwidth decreases with further reduction of the electron concentration . as this takes place , the peak intensities",
    "first grow and then saturate .",
    "the maximum energies of the band are located near the boundary of the magnetic brillouin zone . for parameters of figure  [",
    "fig_iii]c for these momenta the band touches the fermi level and the corresponding peaks disappear above it ( see figure  [ fig_iii]d ) .",
    "these properties of the band resembles those of the spin - polaron band in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "this latter band is also located near the fermi level , has the similar dispersion and the bandwidth , which decreases with the reduction of the electron concentration ( with the increase of the hole doping counted from half - filling ) @xcite .",
    "however , there is one essential difference in the behavior of these bands in the hubbard and @xmath0-@xmath1 models . in the former model the narrow band near the fermi level appears at a certain deficiency of electrons , while the above - mentioned four bands exist in the entire considered range of electron concentrations . in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model",
    "the situation is opposite  the spin - polaron band exist in the wide range of hole concentrations @xmath153 , while the wider band  an analog of the four - band structure  starts to form at @xmath154 @xcite .",
    "the value of the chemical potential for which the fermi level enters the minimum of @xmath115 and the narrow band begins to form depends on the ratio @xmath155 .",
    "for example , for @xmath156 this happens at @xmath157 .",
    "there is some difficulty in the comparison of our results with the data of monte - carlo calculations and cluster theories .",
    "it is connected with the fact mentioned in reference  @xcite : the one - loop approximation overestimates the spectral weights of the two internal bands of the four - band structure near the momenta @xmath158 and @xmath159 . as a consequence",
    "the electron concentration calculated from the formula @xmath160 appears to be considerably underestimated .",
    "for example , for the parameters of figures  [ fig_iii]a and  [ fig_iii]c such estimated @xmath161 equals to @xmath162 and @xmath163 , respectively . from the comparison of the dispersions in figures  [ fig_iii]b and  [ fig_iii]d with the results of monte - carlo calculations ( figure  9 in @xcite )",
    "it can be concluded that these concentrations have to be approximately @xmath164 and @xmath165 , respectively . with this in mind",
    "we find that the spectral functions and dispersions in figure  [ fig_iii ] are close to the monte - carlo spectra ( cf .  with figures  10 and  11 in @xcite ) . in these latter spectra for some deviation from half - filling a weakly dispersive feature is also observed near the fermi level . however , this feature has low intensity and is lost at the foot of a more intensive maximum on approaching the boundary of the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "these differences may be connected with the comparative high temperature @xmath166 used in the monte - carlo simulations .",
    "a similar weakly dispersive feature near the fermi level was obtained also in quantum cluster theories , however for much smaller deviations from half - filling ( cf . with figure  2c in @xcite and figure  32 in @xcite ) .",
    "the considered diagram technique is very promising for a generalization to many - band hubbard models for which energy parameters of the one - site parts of the hamiltonians exceed or at least are comparable to the intersite parameters .",
    "the expansion in powers of these latter parameters can be expressed in terms of cumulants in the same manner as discussed above .",
    "now there are distinct cumulants which belong to different site states characterized by dissimilar parameters of the repulsion and the level energy .",
    "these cumulants are described by formulas similar to equations  ( [ firstc ] ) and  ( [ secondc ] ) .",
    "for example , for the emery model @xcite which describes oxygen @xmath167 and copper @xmath168 orbitals of cu - o planes in high-@xmath169 superconductors there are two types of cumulants corresponding to these states .",
    "diagrams of the lowest orders , e.g. , for green s function on copper sites resemble those shown in figure  [ fig_i ] where `` oxygen '' cumulants are included in hopping lines .",
    "equations of the type of ( [ tlarkin ] ) and partial summations similar to equation  ( [ thopping ] ) can be derived also in this case .    in summary ,",
    "the diagram technique for the one - band hubbard model was formulated for the case of moderate to strong hubbard repulsion .",
    "the expansion in powers of the hopping constant is expressed in terms of site cumulants of electron creation and annihilation operators . for green s function",
    "the equation of the larkin type was derived and solved for the case of two dimensions and nearest - neighbor hopping . with decreasing",
    "the electron concentration in addition to the four bands observed at half - filling a narrow band arises near the fermi level for momenta near the boundary of the magnetic brillouin zone . on the occurrence",
    "the width of the band is comparable to the superexchange constant @xmath151 which indicates the participation of the spin excitations in the band formation .",
    "the bandwidth decreases with decreasing the electron concentration .",
    "the maximum energies of the band are located near the boundary of the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "for some deviation from half - filling in these points the band touch the fermi level . by these properties",
    "the band resembles the spin - polaron band of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
