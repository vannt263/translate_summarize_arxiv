    "the most important events in the cell cycle are replication of the cell s dna and separation of the replicated dna molecules to the daughter cells . in eukaryotic cells ,",
    "these events ( replication and separation ) occur in temporarily distinct stages ( s phase and m phase , respectively ) .",
    "s and m phase are separated in time by gaps called g1 and g2 phases .    during s phase (  synthesis \" ) ,",
    "double - stranded dna molecules are replicated to produce pairs of sister chromatids . during m phase (  mitosis \" ) , sister chromatids",
    "are separated so that each daughter cell receives a copy of each chromosome .",
    "the g1 checkpoint mechanism controls the initiation of s phase , and a g2 checkpoint mechanism controls entry in m phase . a mitotic checkpoint controls the transition from m phase back to g1 phase .",

    "these cyclins combine with kinase subunits ( cdc28 ) to form active cyclin - dependent kinase heterodimers that trigger cell cycle events ( cdc28/cln2 initiates budding , cdc28/clb5 initiates dna synthesis , cdc28/clb2 initiates mitosis ) .",
    "cdc28 subunits are in constant , high abundance throughout cell cycle ; hence , the activity of cdc28/cyclin heterodimers is controlled by the availability of cyclin subunits .",
    "for this reason , cdc28 is not shown in figure 1 ; only the cyclin subunits are specified .",
    "( each cyclin molecule is understood to have a cdc28 partner . )",

    "sic1 does not bind to or inhibit cdc28/cln dimers .",
    "mcm1 , mbf , sbf and swi5 are transcription factors for synthesis of clb2 , clb5 , cln2 and sic1 , respectively .",
    "the degradation of these proteins is regulated by a ubiquitination pathway .",
    "proteins destined for degradation are first labeled by attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules .",
    "ubiquitin moieties are attached to clb2 and clb5 by the apc ( anaphase promoting complex ) in conjunction with either cdc20 or hct1 .",
    "sic1 is ubiquitinated by a different mechanism(the  scf \" ) , which ( unlike the apc ) requires that its substrates be phosphorylated .",
    "budding yeast cells progress through the division cycle as the levels of the species in figure 1 come and go .",
    "thus the problem of cell cycle control is to understand the temporal fluctuations of these species . because the species in figure 1 are directly or indirectly interacting with all other species , simultaneous determination of their fluctuating concentrations require a precise mathematical model . using mass action and michaelis - menten rate laws , the complex wiring diagram in figure 1",
