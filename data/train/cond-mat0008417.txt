    "during recent years , the role of many - body correlations has been a dominant theme in the studies of the ultrafast nonlinear optical response of semiconductors in the coherent regime.@xcite in the lowest order in the optical fields , the nonlinear optical polarization comes from the excitation of two electron - hole ( _ e - h _ ) pair states .",
    "the coulomb interactions between these elementary excitations govern the spectral and temporal properties of the nonlinear optical response.@xcite    in noninteracting systems , such as atom - like two - level systems , the only source of optical nonlinearity is the pauli blocking .",
    "this introduces local correlations , due to the phase space filling , between the carriers excited by the pump and the probe optical pulses , which are separated by a time delay @xmath0.@xcite the coulomb interaction brings about new nonlinearities by changing the dynamics of the photoexcited _ e - h _ pairs .",
    "the simplest theoretical approach that accounts for the interactions between photoexcited _ e - h _ pairs is the time - dependent hartree - fock approximation , which leads to the well known semiconductor bloch equations ( sbe ) .",
    "@xcite the latter have been successfully used to describe a variety of experimental results , including , e.g. , the ac stark effect and rabi oscillations,@xcite the fast exponential decay of the time - integrated ( ti ) four - wave - mixing ( fwm ) signal for negative time delays ( @xmath1),@xcite the time - dependence of the time - resolved ( tr ) fwm signal@xcite , the photon echoes coming from the continuum of states,@xcite , and some aspects of phase measurements.@xcite being a mean - field approach , the sbe s replace the coulomb interactions by a spatially - averaged effective field of all the photoexcited excitons , and thus neglect correlations due to exciton - exciton scattering and bound biexciton states .",
    "more recent experiments indicated the importance of coulomb correlations , e.g. , in the dependence of the nonlinear response on the polarization of the optical fields.@xcite many of the experimental results have been explained in terms of excitation - induced dephasing,@xcite and exciton - exciton scattering processes.@xcite the importance of bound biexciton states in fwm was also pointed out , e.g. , in refs .. exciton - exciton correlations have been shown to play a significant role in the ac stark effect@xcite and in quantum beats.@xcite several systematic methods for incorporating many - particle correlations in the coherent nonlinear optical response have been developed,@xcite including the effective exciton hamiltonian approach,@xcite the coherently controlled truncation scheme,@xcite , the correlation function approach,@xcite and the canonical transformation approach .",

    "occurs for @xmath9 , where the binding energy of the 2d magnetoexciton , @xmath10 , exceeds the bohr energy @xmath11 . in typical gaas / algaas quantum wells",
    ", this crossover to the strong magnetic field regime occurs for @xmath12 t.    the second effect of the magnetic field is that , by freezing the kinetic energy of the photoexcited carriers in two spatial dimensions , it increases the relative strength of the exciton - exciton interactions.@xcite in bulk semiconductors , fwm experiments showed a strong enhancement of the fwm signal with increasing magnetic field.@xcite at the same time , the time - integrated signal exhibited a long non - markovian decay for negative time delays.@xcite    in qw s , the exciton - exciton interactions are expected to dominate the coherent optical dynamics as the magnetic field increases .",
    "when the ll separation exceeds the magnetoexciton binding energy , @xmath13 , the inter - ll transitions are suppressed and the optical response is determined by magnetoexcitons confined to the lowest ll ( lll ) .",
    "note that , in an ideal 2d system , the interactions between magnetoexcitons with zero center of mass momentum are suppressed due to the electron - hole symmetry.@xcite in realistic qw s , however , this symmetry is lifted due to , e.g. , the differing band offsets , lateral confinement , and disorder.@xcite as was first pointed out in refs .",
