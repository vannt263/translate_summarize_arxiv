    "low surface brightness ( lsb ) disk galaxies can be defined as rotationally - dominated galaxies with extrapolated central surface brightnesses @xmath923  mag arcsec@xmath10 .",
    "numerous studies have now shown that these are not abnormal objects , but rather are a common product of disk galaxy formation and evolution .    compared with",
    "disk galaxies of high surface brightness ( hsb ) , most late - type lsbs tend to be -rich , with diffuse , low - density stellar disks , and metallicities @xmath81/3 solar ( e.g. , mcgaugh 1994 ) .",
    "this suggests that lsb galaxies have been inefficient star - formers over their lifetimes .",
    "indeed ,  surface densities in lsb galaxies are often observed to be well below the critical threshold for star formation ( e.g. , van der hulst et al . 1993 ) .",
    "nonetheless , lsb galaxies typically contain some signatures of ongoing star formation , including modest amounts of h@xmath11 emission ( e.g. , schombert et al .",
    "1992 ) and blue colors indicative of young stellar populations ( e.g. , mcgaugh & bothun 1994 ; matthews & gallagher 1997 ) .    in spite of",
    "the evidence for modest ongoing star formation , a number of observational and theoretical arguments suggest that lsb galaxies may be extremely molecular gas - deficient systems .",
    "for example , lsb galaxies are generally found to be dust - poor ( e.g. , matthews & wood 2001 ; hereafter mw01 ) .",
    "this , combined with possible low interstellar pressures , and the lack of the cooling effects of metals , might be expected to impede molecular gas formation ( e.g. , gerritsen & de blok 1999 ; mihos , spaans , & mcgaugh 1999 ) .",
    "nonetheless , mw01 have shown that the edge - on lsb galaxy ugc  7321 contains a clumpy ism structure , including candidates for dark clouds , indicating that it may have both the conditions and the catalysts for the formation of h@xmath2 and other molecules .    despite this circumstantial evidence for molecular gas ,",
    "several groups have tried and failed to detect co emission from late - type lsb galaxies ( schombert et al .",
    "1990 ; knezek 1993 ; de blok & van der hulst 1998 ) .",
    "however , these observations used only modest integration times , and are sufficient only to put upper limits on their molecular gas contents of @xmath120.07 - 0.43 . in fact , many of these values are consistent with the @xmath4 ratios typical of hsb sd - sm galaxies ( young & knezek 1989 ) and therefore tell us little about how the molecular gas contents of lsb spirals may differ .",
    "recently , oneil , hofner , & schinnerer ( 2000 ) reported deeper co observations of 4 red lsbs , including a detection of one object .",
    "however , the large  linewidth of the detected galaxy ( @xmath13  ) suggests it is one of the class of relatively rare lsb giants ( e.g. , sprayberry et al .",
    "1995 ; matthews , van driel , & monnier - ragaigne 2001 ) and may be somewhat different in nature from typical late - type lsbs .",
    "motivated by these factors , we have undertaken new deep co(1 - 0 ) observations of 8 late - type , low - mass , lsb spirals .",
    "for our survey we selected a sample of bulgeless , edge - on lsb galaxies of types scd - sm .",
    "targets of relatively large angular size ( @xmath14@xmath15 ) were chosen so that the telescope beam would be well matched to the expected co - emitting regions in the inner disk .",
    "we present here results for 8 galaxies with integration times @xmath165.5 hours .",
    "some general properties of our targets are summarized in table  1 .",
    "although the _ observed _ surface brightnesses of our edge - on sample are enhanced due to projection , their lsb natures are evident from optical imaging and surface photometry ( see table  1 ) .",
    "all have a diffuse , transparent appearance , lack a true dust lane , and have relatively high @xmath17  ratios .",
    "in addition , all of these objects have low star formation rates as evidenced by their weak or undetectable 1.4ghz radio continuum fluxes in the nvss survey ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we chose to emphasize edge - on lsb galaxies in the present study since projected gas surface densities are increased for edge - on viewing angles , hence the detectability of co is maximized .",
    "in addition , edge - on systems provide us with a greatly enhanced ability to identify dark cloud candidates and obtain complementary measurements of the structure of the dust and ionized gas ( e.g. , mw01 ) .",
    "our data were obtained with the nrao 12-m telescope at kitt peak .",
    "most observations were done in 1999 june , with some additional data acquired in 1997 january and 1999 december . at 115.2ghz",
    ", the 12-m telescope has a beam of fwhp@xmath18 .",
    "typical system temperatures during our runs were @xmath19270400k .    our observations employed the 3 mm dual sis receivers and the two @xmath20mhz filter bank spectrometers .",
    "telescope pointing and focus were checked frequently by observing planets or bright quasars .",
    "data were obtained in bsp ( beam+position switching ) mode using the nutating secondary with a beam throw @xmath21@xmath22 . to eliminate spurious signals , we obtained roughly half of our data with the source velocity offset @xmath2350  from the bandpass center .",
    "for all 8 targets we obtained data at the optical center of the galaxy .",
    "we also observed some offsets along the major axes of ugc  7321 and ngc  4244 ( table  2 ) .",
    "our data were calibrated by performing a vane ( chopper wheel ) measurement after every other 6-minute scan .",
    "our absolute calibration was also checked by measuring the co line strength of m82 at least once during each observing run .",
    "we estimate an absolute flux accuracy of @xmath520% .",
    "we reduced our spectra using the class and unipops analysis packages .",
    "all scans were individually inspected , and those with highly structured baselines were discarded .",
    "scans were also examined in blocks according to acquisition time in order to check for recurrent spurious signals .",
    "channels repeatedly exhibiting positive or negative spikes @xmath24 above the rms noise were blanked and substituted with values interpolated from the adjacent channels . next a velocity window was chosen from  data , and a linear baseline was subtracted from each scan .",
    "all remaining scans were then assigned weights according to their mean rms noise and averaged to obtain the final spectra .",
    "the final spectra for each of our target galaxies are shown in figure  1 .",
    "the data are smoothed to a resolution of @xmath52040  to enhance signal - to - noise .",
    "we detect the co(1 - 0 ) line at @xmath0 ( after smoothing ) in 3 of our targets ( ugc  2082 , ugc  7321 , ngc  4244 ) , and marginally detect one object ( ugc  6667 ) at @xmath1 .",
    "these represent some of the first direct detections of molecular gas in late - type , lsb spiral galaxies .",
    "table  2 summarizes co linewidths at 50% peak maximum ( @xmath25 ) , line centroids ( @xmath26 ) , and integrated co line intensity ( @xmath27 ) , measured for the detected galaxies using gaussian fits .    to within observational uncertainties",
    "we find that the line centroids of our detected signals show good agreement with  systemic velocities of these galaxies from the literature ( see table  1 ) .",
    "in addition , the co linewidths of our putative detections are roughly comparable with the  linewidths .",
    "this would be expected for co spread over the central few kpc of these lsb galaxies , as is generally found in late - type spirals ( e.g. , young & knezek 1989 ) .",
    "one of our detected sources ( ngc  4244 ) was previously detected in co by sage ( 1993a , b ) , offering corroborating evidence that our detection is real .",
    "like sage ( 1993a , b ) we detected co(1 - 0 ) emission both at the optical center of the galaxy as well as at offset positions along the major axis .",
    "however , the strengths of our measured lines are much weaker .",
    "since we used significantly longer integrations and the 12-m system performance is much improved since the late 1980 s , our new data strongly suggest that ngc  4244 is a weaker co source than previously reported .    for the 4 galaxies where no clear signal was detected , we compute 3@xmath6 upper limits using : @xmath28^{0.5}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the rms noise in the final spectrum in mk , @xmath30 is the  linewidth , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the channel spacing in and @xmath33 is the entire velocity coverage of the spectrum ( gao 1996 ) .",
    "these upper limits are summarized in table  3 .",
    "we estimate the total mass of molecular hydrogen within the 55@xmath34 telescope beam ( table 3 ) from : @xmath35\\epsilon^{-1}~~(m_{\\odot})\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the integrated co line flux in k@xmath37  ( @xmath38 scale ) , @xmath39 is the telescope beam diameter in pc at the distance of the galaxy , and @xmath40 is the main beam efficiency of the telescope ( 0.84 at 115.3  ghz for the 12-m as of 2000 january ) .",
    "this formula assumes a gaussian beam and a standard galactic value of the co - to - h@xmath2 conversion factor @xmath41cm@xmath10/[k ] ( where @xmath43 ; e.g. , young & scoville 1991 ) , which is applicable to the molecular clouds at virial equilibrium . for galaxies where data were obtained at off - center pointings ,",
    "the total h@xmath2 mass was estimated by summing the individual spectra according to eq .  3 of sage ( 1993a ) .",
    "the applicability of the standard @xmath44 factor to the diffuse , low metallicity environments of lsb galaxies remains highly controversial ( e.g. , maloney & black 1988 ; mihos et al .",
    "1999 ) , as low densities , low metallicities , and low dust contents in lsbs would all seemingly argue in favor a higher @xmath44 value , while clumpiness of the ism and/or the absence of a strong uv dissociating flux may somewhat lower this number .",
    "this creates some uncertainty in our @xmath45 estimates .",
    "moreover , our derived co fluxes should be regarded as conservative , since data were obtained at offset pointings only for ngc  4244 and ugc  7321 , and since some shadowing may occur in edge - on galaxies if the co is optically thick . however",
    ", this latter effect is expected to be small for lsb systems , and based on the typical sizes of co - emitting regions in late - type galaxies , it is unlikely in the present survey that a significant fraction of co - emitting gas lay outside our beam ( see also below ) .",
    "previous null detections of co in lsb galaxies have been interpreted to suggest that either co does not trace h@xmath2 in these galaxies or simply that lsb galaxies are devoid of molecular gas .",
    "it has even been postulated that stars may form directly from atomic hydrogen in these galaxies ( e.g. , schombert et al .",
    "our new observations show that at least some low - mass , late - type lsb galaxies do contain a modest molecular gas component . if the galactic @xmath44 factor is adopted , we find the implied @xmath4 ratios ( 0.010 - 0.055 ; table  3 ) are several times smaller than those typically found for brighter sd - sm spirals ( 0.19@xmath230.10 ) by young & knezek ( 1989 ) .",
    "however , this does not seem unexpected for dim , diffuse galaxies that are inefficient at converting their raw , atomic gas into stars .",
    "the strength of fir ( 60 and 100@xmath46 m ) emission is well known to correlate with co strength in hsb galaxies ( e.g. , sage 1993a ) , and all 3 of our co - detected lsbs were detected by _ iras _",
    "( table  1 ) .",
    "we find these galaxies follow the fir-@xmath45 correlation of sage ( 1993a ) , suggesting that their inferred molecular gas supplies are adequate to sustain their observed star formation rates and that we have not grossly ( i.e. , by more than a factor of a few ) underestimated their total h@xmath2 contents .",
    "in our present sample we find no other obvious correlations between detection in co and global properties ( e.g. , color , @xmath17 ) .",
    "this may simply reflect our small sample size , and underscores the need for more molecular gas observations of larger samples of lsb galaxies .",
    "we have presented deep co(1 - 0 ) observations of 8 edge - on , late - type , lsb spiral galaxies . these are among the most sensitive co observations of lsb galaxies obtained to date .",
    "we have detected 3 of our targets galaxies at a @xmath0 level , and have marginally detected one object at @xmath1 .",
    "these represent some of the first direct detections of molecular gas in low - mass , late - type lsb spiral galaxies . adopting a galactic co - to - h@xmath2 conversion factor , we find values of @xmath47  for the detected galaxies , and upper limits @xmath7  for the undetected objects .",
    "lsb spirals appear to be deficient in molecular gas relative to their atomic gas contents compared with brighter spirals of similar hubble type , although the validity of the galactic co - to - h@xmath2 conversion factor for these systems is still controversial .",
    "we thank the observing staff at the 12-m telescope , as well as w. van driel and d. monnier - ragaigne for their contributions in support of this project .",
    "an anonymous referee also provided useful comments .",
    "this research made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by jpl under contract with nasa ."
