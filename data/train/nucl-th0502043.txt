    "in recent years , there has been a great deal of interest in the synthesis of superheavy elements by means of heavy - ion fusion at near barrier energies @xcite . due to",
    "very low production probabilities , investigation of heavy - ion fusion reactions remains a challenging task both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "theoretical investigations are mostly based on transport theory in which heavy - ion fusion is viewed as a diffusion process @xcite . during the approach phase ,",
    "a part of the kinetic energy of the relative motion dissipates into intrinsic degrees of freedom , colliding ions overcome the coulomb barrier and a sticking configuration is formed .",
    "subsequently , the system evolves inward over the conditional saddle to form a spherical compound nucleus .",
    "heavy - ion fusion is described in terms of a few relevant variables , which evolve according to a langevin dynamics as in a typical diffusion process . in most of these investigations quantum statistical effects",
    "are ignored and a classical treatment is employed , in which friction and diffusion properties are related through classical fluctuation - dissipation theorem . since",
    "superheavy elements are stabilized by the shell correction energy , they should be synthesized at reasonably low energies , which corresponds to nuclear temperatures of the order of @xmath0 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "the curvature of the conditional saddle is also of the order of @xmath1 mev . as a result",
    ", it is expected that the quantum statistical effects play an important role in the formation of a compound nucleus by diffusion along the conditional potential barrier @xcite . in a recent work , using the density matrix formalism , we derived a generalized fokker - planck equation for the distribution function of relevant collective variables with non - markovian transport coefficients and we illustrated the quantum statistical effects on the formation of compound nucleus at low temperatures @xcite . here , we consider the same problem , but follow a different description based on generalized langevin approach . by projection on the collective space , it is possible to deduce stochastic equations of motion for collective variables .",
    "the friction term involves memory effect and the random force acts as a correlated noise and they are related according to quantum fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite . as a result",
    ", the quantum statistical fluctuations are incorporated into the description and the approach is valid at all temperatures . in principle , the langevin approach presented here is equivalent to the density matrix formalism , however it has certain advantages as compared to the description by the fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "one thing is that , in realistic situations , numerical simulations of langevin equation require much less numerical effort than the solution of the fokker - planck equation .",
    "furthermore , diffusion coefficients presented here are modified by the friction mechanism , which was not considered in the density matrix approach @xcite . in section 2 ,",
    "we derive generalized langevin equations for the relevant collective variables . in section 3",
    ", we present an analysis of the langevin equation . in section 4 , in order to illustrate the effect of quantum statistical fluctuations , we present calculations to describe the heavy - ion fusion reactions at low temperatures .",
    "finally , we give conclusions in section 5 .",
    "it is possible to derive transport equation for the entire dynamics of the heavy - ion fusion process , starting from the entrance channel until formation of a compound nucleus . here , we want to investigate the influence of quantum statistical fluctuations on the formation probability of compound nucleus at near barrier energies . for this purpose",
    ", we consider a part of the dynamics , namely , evolution of the system along the conditional saddle from sticking configuration until formation of compound nucleus . for simplicity",
    ", we describe the evolution in terms of a single collective variable , namely the elongation variable , @xmath2 , which approximately corresponds to the relative distance between the colliding ions .",
    "we consider a model , in which evolution of the system is described by a hamiltonian of the form , @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the hamiltonian of the intrinsic nucleonic degrees of freedom , the hamiltonian of the collective variable and the coupling interaction of the collective variable with the intrinsic nucleonic degrees of freedom , respectively . for simplicity , we consider a harmonic form for the collective hamiltonian @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the mass parameter of the collective variable and @xmath9 denotes the magnitude of the curvature parameter of the potential energy , positive sign stands for a parabolic potential well and negative sign for a parabolic potential barrier .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the coupling hamiltonian has a linear form , @xmath10 .",
    "the classical equation of motion for the collective variable can be deduced from @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes an average over the intrinsic degrees of freedom , to give , @xmath13 here , the quantity on the right hand side denotes the force of the intrinsic degrees of freedom on the collective motion .",
    "we consider the case where the coupling @xmath14 is a one - body operator .",
    "we then need only the single - particle density matrix @xmath15 of the intrinsic degrees of freedom to calculate the force .",
    "as we discuss below , temporal evolution of the single - particle density matrix exhibits a stochastic behavior . as a result",
    ", the intrinsic force has a fluctuating part on the top of its average value . here , we find it more convenient to calculate the fluctuating part of force , which is determined by the fluctuating part of the single - particle density matrix @xmath16 , where the bar means taking ensemble average .",
    "assuming fluctuations are small , @xmath17 is determined by a linearized transport equation @xcite around the average @xmath18 , @xmath19    -[\\delta q(t)f,\\bar{\\rho}(t)]=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the hartree - fock hamiltonian of the separated nuclei and @xmath22 denotes the fluctuation of the collective variable around its average value @xmath23 .",
    "the ensemble average value of the density matrix is determined by , @xmath24=0 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for simplicity of derivation , we neglect the collision term on the right hand side of eq.([e3 ] ) and eq.([e33 ] ) @xcite , however subsequently , we incorporate the damping width of single - particle states . starting from an initial state @xmath25 at some time @xmath26 , the formal solution of eq.([e3 ] ) can be given as , @xmath27+g(t , s)\\delta\\rho(s)g^{\\dag}(t , s)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term describes the effects of the perturbation during the time interval @xmath28 with @xmath29\\approx \\exp\\left[-(i/\\hbar)(t - s)\\bar{h}(t)\\right]$ ] as the mean - field propagator , i.e. the propagator in the absence of thermal fluctuation , and the second term represent the propagation of the initial fluctuations @xmath25 of the intrinsic degrees of freedom during the time interval from @xmath26 to @xmath30 . here",
    ", the initial time @xmath26 does not represent the remote past , but rather it is sufficiently close to the time @xmath30 , so that the time interval is much shorter than the relaxation time of the intrinsic degrees of freedom @xmath31 .",
    "hence , the neglect of correlations due to collision term is justified in the description of eq.([e4 ] ) . in this case",
    ", the effect of correlations enters through the initial fluctuation term .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the collective motion is sufficiently slow so that the intrinsic degrees of freedom is close to local equilibrium for each value of the collective variable . in order to evaluate the matrix elements of the fluctuating part of the density operator based on eq.([e4 ] ) , we approximate the average density matrix in terms of the instantaneous single - particle wave functions as @xmath32 , where we neglect the off diagonal elements . in this expression ,",
    "the instantaneous wave functions @xmath33 $ ] are determined from @xmath34 for each value of the collective variable @xmath2 , and @xmath35 + 1\\right]$ ] denotes the fermi - dirac occupation factor at a temperature @xmath36 . employing the instantaneous representation ,",
    "the matrix elements of fluctuations can be expressed as , @xmath37 with @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "it is not possible to determine detailed structure of initial fluctuations of the intrinsic degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , it is plausible to assume that each matrix element of @xmath25 is a gaussian random quantity with zero mean @xmath39 and a second moment . in accordance with the fluctuation - dissipation relation of the single - particle density matrix , we specify the second moment of @xmath25 as , @xmath40\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the special case of diagonal elements this formula gives the known result for fluctuations of occupation numbers , @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "substituting eq.([e4 ] ) into the right hand side of eq.([e2 ] ) , we find a generalized langevin equation for the fluctuations of the collective variable , @xmath42 where the memory kernel in the retarded force and the random force term are given by @xmath43\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath44    using eq.([e5 ] ) , the auto - correlation function of the random force can be expressed as , @xmath45\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] dissipation and fluctuation aspects of dynamics are closely connected to each other , the similarity of expressions for the correlation function and the memory kernel reflects this fact . if the decay time of the memory kernel is sufficiently short , we can explicitly incorporate the memory effect into the retarded force in eq.([e6 ] ) .",
    "for evolution over a short time interval from @xmath46 to @xmath30 , by neglecting the right hand side of eq.([e6 ] ) , we find the following relation , @xmath47 for a parabolic potential well , propagators @xmath48 and @xmath49 are given by , @xmath50 on the other hand , for a parabolic potential barrier , these propagators are given by , @xmath51 the first term in eq.([e10 ] ) involving @xmath52 introduces a shift in the curvature parameter of the potential . here",
    ", we neglect this effect and substitute the second term on the right hand side of eq.([e10 ] ) into the right hand side of eq.([e6 ] ) .",
    "note that , since the fluctuations are linear , the same equation as eq.([e6 ] ) , but without the last term on the right hand side , holds for the average evolution by replacing @xmath53 and @xmath52 with @xmath54 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "therefore , combining the average evolution with the fluctuations , we obtain a generalized langevin equation for the actual variables , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 here , the reduced friction coefficient is given by , @xmath58 substituting eqs.([e11 ] ) and ( [ e12 ] ) for @xmath59 , we find for the friction coefficient for a parabolic well , @xmath60n_{i}(1-n_{j})+c.c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for a parabolic barrier , @xmath61n_{i}(1-n_{j})+c.c.\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in obtaining these results , we include the damping width @xmath62 of the single - particle states into the propagator in eq.([e14 ] ) @xcite . in further evaluation of the friction coefficients ,",
    "we neglect the time - dependent terms in eqs.([e15 ] ) and ( [ e16 ] ) .",
    "the reason is the following : the dominant contributions to the friction coefficient arise from the coupling matrix element over an energy interval of the order of major shell spacing , @xmath63 mev , which is much larger than typical values of collective frequency we consider here , @xmath64 mev . if the single - particle spectrum is sufficiently dense , the summations over the single particle states can be converted to energy integrals . as a result , exponential factors in eq.([e15 ] ) and",
    "eq.([e16 ] ) damp out over a time interval of the order of @xmath65 .",
    "furthermore , in particular for low frequency collective motion , @xmath66 , these exponential factors damp out even over a shorter time scale as a result of damping of the single - particle states .",
    "therefore , for a sufficiently long time interval , @xmath67 , neglecting time dependent terms , we have for a parabolic well , @xmath68    n_{i}(1-n_{j})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for a parabolic barrier , @xmath69    n_{i}(1-n_{j})\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as seen from these results , for finite @xmath70 , the friction coefficient has different expressions around a well and a barrier .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath71 , it can be easily seen that these expressions become identical , known as the one - body friction formula .",
    "we call this limiting value as the classical friction coefficient and denote as @xmath72 .",
    "we introduce the fourier transform of the correlation function of the random force @xcite , @xmath73 where , @xmath74    n_{i}(1-n_{j})\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at low frequencies , @xmath75 is just @xmath76 the classical diffusion coefficient . on the other hand ,",
    "the high frequency behavior is restricted by the magnitude of the coupling matrix elements .",
    "if the single particle spectrum is sufficiently dense , the magnitude of coupling matrix elements must decrease as a function of energy difference , mainly due to the mismatch of the overlap of the wave functions .",
    "we can represent this behavior by a gaussian or a lorentzian function @xmath77 $ ] or @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , because of the lorentzian factors in eq.([e20 ] ) , we can replace the energy difference @xmath79 with the frequency @xmath80 and approximately describe frequency dependence of diffusion coefficient as @xmath81 $ ] , here we take the gaussian for the frequency spectrum . as a result , the correlation function eq.([e19 ] ) of the random force can be expressed as , @xmath82 where @xmath83\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the correlation function is characterized by two different parameters , the cut - off energy and temperature .",
    "figure 1 shows the correlation function versus time at different temperatures @xmath84 mev , @xmath85 mev and @xmath86 mev .",
    "the results presented in this work are not very sensitive to the cut - off energy over a range of values @xmath87 mev .",
    "therefore , in this figure and all other figures , we employ @xmath88 mev for the cut - off energy . at relatively high temperature @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and",
    "the correlation function reduces to its classical form , @xmath91    = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\tau_0}\\exp\\left[-(t - t')^{2}/2\\tau_{0}^{2}\\right]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for sufficiently short decay time @xmath92 , it can be approximated by a delta function , @xmath93 , and as a result at high temperatures , the temporal evolution becomes markovian and the random force @xmath94 acts like a white noise .",
    "however , as seen from the figure , in the quantal regime i.e. at low temperatures @xmath95 , we are faced with a stochastic evolution with a correlated noise @xcite .",
    "in order to obtain the joint probability distribution function @xmath96 of the collective variable and its conjugate momentum @xmath97 by numerical simulation of the langevin equation , in general , we need to generate a sufficiently large ensemble of trajectories .",
    "since , we have a correlated noise problem , we can not use the standard methods @xcite and we need to adopt suitable algorithms for numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "however , in the situation that we consider here , the solution of the langevin eq.([e13 ] ) can be given analytically @xcite .",
    "since the equation is linear with a gaussian random source , the probability distribution @xmath96 of collective variables is also gaussian , which is determined by the mean values @xmath98 , @xmath99 and the variances @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 of collective variables according to , @xmath103\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 and @xmath105 is the inverse of the @xmath106 matrix @xmath107 with elements @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",

    "we need to calculate the dynamical fluctuations of collective variables in terms of the random force .",
