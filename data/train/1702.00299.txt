    "many studies on astrophysical massive compact objects assumed the matter distribution is generally isotropic . however , such simplified assumptions yields satisfactory results to some extend and not for all systems .",
    "recent researches in theoretical physics on the compact stellar systems suggested that matter distribution at the interior of these compact objects is most probably to be anisotropic from certain density ranges @xcite . in the light of these studies , a new physics emerges to study the properties of anisotropic matter distributions in general relativity .",
    "the anisotropy in pressure could be introduced by the existence of a solid core , type p superfluid , complex nuclear interactions , or inclusion of net electric charge .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath6 of such anisotropic matter is equivalent to those by assuming a fluid composed of two perfect fluids , or a perfect fluid and a null fluid , or two null fluids @xcite .",
    "most of the method commonly adopted by many researchers to explore new analytic solutions of the field equations are by assuming @xmath0 or @xmath7 , radial pressure , anisotropy , electric field , density and equation of state so that the field equations are integrable @xcite .",
    "the buchdahl limit of ideal fluid distributions postulated that the compactness parameter @xmath8 should be @xmath9 so that it does nt proceed a gravitational collapse so that can form a singularity or black hole .",
    "this upper bound in @xmath10 is generalized by andreasson @xcite with the inclusion of charge , anisotropy and even cosmological constant . in the derivation of the new generalized upper bound in @xmath10 , he assumed a simple inequality in between pressure and density as @xmath11 .",
    "many investigations have also shown that the behavior of a collapsing star is strongly influence by its initial static configuration on account for various parameters like , pressure anisotropy , charge , eos , shear , radiations etc .",
    "two static configurations at the initial with same masses and radii for different pressure profiles when undergoing collapse leads to very different temperature evolution at their later stages @xcite .",
    "hence , to completely understand the physics evolving stars one needs to understand the initial static configurations with the inclusion these various factors . in newtonian approximation , adiabatic collapse of a fluid distribution obeying polytropic eos",
    "is possible only when the adiabatic index @xmath12 .",
    "however , this idea is turnover by chan et al .",
    "@xcite for anisotropic fluid objects where collapse is still possible even for @xmath13 depending on the nature of anisotropy .",
    "herrera and santos @xcite have also suggested that the stability of static stellar configurations can be enhanced by the nature of local anisotropy .",
    "inclusion of charge is the source of electric field which can cause pressure anisotropy usov @xcite and it can counter balanced the gravitational attraction by the electric repulsion other than the pressure gradient . on using this concepts ivanov @xcite proposed a model for charged perfect fluid that inhibits the growth of spacetime curvature to avoid singularities .",
    "bonnor @xcite also pointed out that a dust distribution of arbitrarily large mass can be bounded in very small radius and maintained equilibrium against the gravity by a repulsive force produced by a small amount of charge .",
    "thus it is interesting to study the implications of einstein - maxwell s field equations in general relativistic .",
    "bhar et al .",
    "@xcite also presented new class of exact interior solution of einstein - maxwell s field equations in @xmath14 dimensional spacetime by assuming chaplygin gas eos and krori - barua metric with charged btz spacetime as exterior . using this solution",
    "they have discussed all the physical properties of charged anisotropic stellar configuration .",
    "bhar and rahaman @xcite proposed a new model of dark energy star consisting of five zones viz solid core of constant energy density , thin shell between core and interior , an inhomogeneous interior region with anisotropic pressures , a thin shell , and the exterior vacuum region .",
    "bhar @xcite also used the krori - barua metric potentials in the presence of quintessence field to model stable strange star model .    in this article , we have adopted a new method in order of discover new exact solution of einstein - maxwell s field equations that satisfies tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation .",
    "we adopted the method used by karmarker 1948 to solve the field equation where the obtained solutions are classified as class one . in this method the reimann curvature tensor",
    "@xmath15 satisfy a particular equation that finally link the two metric component @xmath0 and @xmath7 in a single equation i.e. the two metric components are dependent on each other .",
    "therefore , we only need to assume one of the metric potential and electric field intensity to integrate the field equations . the rest of the physical quantities like pressure , density , sound speed , anisotropy , etc",
    ". can be completely determine from @xmath16 and @xmath17 only .",
    "many other articles are also available in literature on embedding class one solutions @xcite .",
    "to describe the interior of a static and spherically symmetry object the line element can be taken in canonical co - ordinate as , @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are functions of the radial coordinate ` @xmath21 ' only . + now if the space - time ( [ met ] ) satisfies the karmarkar condition @xcite @xmath22 with @xmath23 @xcite , it represents the space - time of emending class 1 .",

    "+ now we have to solve the einstein - maxwell s field equations ( [ dens])-([char ] ) with the help of equation ( [ elam ] ) .",
    "one can notice that we have five equations with 6 unknowns namely @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . to solve the above set of equations let us ansatz the metric co - efficient @xmath47 proposed by adler @xcite as , @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are constants .",

    "however , @xcite and @xcite simplify such messy calculations and reduced it to much more simpler formulism .",
    "they have assumed that the adiabatic index of a pulsating star is same as in a slowly deformed matter .",
    "this leads to a stable configuration only if the mass of the star is increasing with central density i.e. @xmath66 and unstable if @xmath67 .    in our solution",

    "[ tov ] ( right ) .",
    "it has been observed that the physical parameters @xmath73 are positive at the center , within the limit of realistic equation of state and monotonically decreasing outward ( figs . [ md ] , [ prpt ] , [ sv ] ) .",

    "this stiff eos yields a compactness parameter of 0.823 , which is very closed to the buchdahl limit 0.889 and also the total mass of @xmath76 is bounded in a very small radius of 10.1@xmath77 only . for the chosen values mentioned in fig .",

    "the relativistic adiabatic index at the center are @xmath88 and @xmath89 and are also increasing monotonically outward .",
    "the redshift of the configuration at the surface is of about 1.01 .",
    "+ furthermore , our presented solution satisfies weak energy condition ( wec ) , null energy condition ( nec ) and dominant energy condition ( dec ) which is shown in fig .",
    "the stability factor @xmath90 lies in between 0 and 1 which represents a stable configuratio ( fig .",
    "the decreasing nature of pressures and density is further justified by their negativity of their gradients , fig .",
    "the solution also represents a static and equilibrium configuration as the force acting on the fluid sphere is counter - balancing each other . for a charged anisotropic stellar fluid in equilibrium the gravitational force , the hydro - static pressure , the coulomb force and the anisotropic force are acting through a generalized tov - equation and they are counter - balancing to each other , fig .",
    "the stability analysis of the solution is also extended by adopting the harrison - zeldovich - novikov static stability criterion . according to the static stability criterion",
    ", the variation of mass must be increasing in trend with the increase in central density i.e. @xmath91 for stable and @xmath92 for unstable configurations . the fig .",
    "[ tov ] , we have plotted the mass by varying @xmath93 from @xmath94 and it is noticeable that the maximum mass becomes saturated at @xmath4 from about @xmath95 . hence from all the above analysis , we conclude that the presented solution satisfy ( i ) tov - equation showing its equilibrium condition and also satisfies the static stable criterion of harrison - zeldovich - novikov i.e. @xmath91 .",
