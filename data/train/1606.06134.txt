    "the diffractive physics program pursued at the hera @xmath2 collider in the recent past has substantially improved our knowledge on the dynamics of this class of processes . in the deep inelastic regime ,",
    "the presence of a hard scale enables the derivation of a dedicated factorisation theorem  @xcite which allows the investigation of the partonic structure of the colour singlet exchanged in the @xmath3-channel . from scaling violations of the diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( ddis ) structure functions , quite precise diffractive parton distributions functions ( dpdfs ) have been extracted by performing qcd analysis  @xcite of available data .    with this tool available , factorisation tests have been conducted in order to investigate the range of validity of this hypothesis in processes other than ddis .",
    "factorisation has been shown to hold , as expected theoretically , in diffractive dijets production in dis , where nlo predictions based on dpdfs well describe experimental cross sections  @xcite both in shape and normalisation .",
    "factorisation breaking effects are expected to appear in diffractive photoproduction of dijets due to the resolved component of the quasi - real photon . in such a case , however , h1  @xcite reported a global suppression factor of data over nlo theory around 0.5 while zeus  @xcite found the same ratio compatible with unity . to date , these conflicting results prevent to draw a conclusive statement about factorisation in this case .",
    "we note , however , that the measurements of diffractive dijet photoproduction in ultraperipheral collisions in @xmath0 and @xmath4 collisions at the lhc  @xcite may offer an alternative way to settle this issue .",
    "complementary informations on the nature of diffraction has been provided by hard diffraction measurements in hadronic collisions . as theoretically anticipated in refs .",
    "@xcite and experimentally observed in @xmath5 collisions at tevatron  @xcite , factorisation is strongly violated in such a case .",
    "in particular , predictions based on a factorised expressions for the relevant cross sections in terms of diffractive parton distributions extracted from hera data overestimate hard diffraction measurements by a factor @xmath6 .",
    "this conclusion persists even after the inclusion of higher order qcd corrections  @xcite .",
    "a rich program at the lhc is being pursued in diffractive physics by all collaborations either based on the identification of large rapidity gaps ( lrg )  @xcite or by using dedicated proton spectrometers  @xcite . complementing tevatron ( @xmath7 tev ) results with forthcoming ones from the lhc at higher centre - of - mass energies ( @xmath8 tev )",
    "will give information on the energy dependence , if any , of the suppression factor , the socalled rapidity gap survival ( rgs ) probability .",
    "hopefully , they will allow to study its kinematic dependences , among which the one on the scale characterising the hard process appears to be particularly relevant .",
    "in the simplest scenario , it will be possible to clarify whether factorisation may still hold but revisited in a weak form through a global or local rescaling of diffractive pdfs extracted from ddis and to study their degree of universality among different hard processes in hadronic collisions .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to present predictions for the single - diffractive drell - yan pair production at the lhc at @xmath1 tev , one of the clean and simple measurable process in hadronic collisions .",
    "in such a process , the invariant mass of the lepton pair can be easily reconstructed and , depending on experimental capabilities , pushed to rather low values , allowing a detailed characterisation of the hard - scale dependence of the suppression factor .",
    "althought estimates of the latter are present in the literature for the specific process at hand  @xcite , we take a conservative approach and avoid to introduce any suppression factor .",
    "we further assume factorisation to hold and adopt factorised expressions for the relevant cross sections . a preliminar set of , newly generated",
    ", diffractive parton distributions extracted from combined leading proton hera data will be used for the calculation . in view of the expected factorisation",
    "breaking effects in hard , single - diffractive , measurements in hadronic collisions , the obtained values for the cross sections should be considered as upper bounds .",
    "given the explorative nature of the analysis , more intended as a feasibility study , theoretical predictions are calculated to leading order accuracy .",
    "we take into account , however , the virtual photon decay into leptons so that cross sections can be studied as a function of , measurable , final state leptons kinematics .",
    "this allows us to explore the phase space available for the process and to estimate the impact of typical experimental cuts on the transverse momenta and rapidities of the leptons .    from qcd analyses performed in ddis and anticipating the results of the next section ,",
    "we know that the colour - singlet exchanged in the @xmath3-channel is a gluon - enriched state .",
    "since gluonic contributions to drell - yan production starts to @xmath9 in perturbation theory , an accurate estimation of the suppression factor will require the inclusion of higher order corrections .",
    "the impact of the latter and a detailed report on the extraction of diffractive parton distributions to nlo accuracy will be presented in a companion publication .",

    ", the flattening of the distribution at small @xmath16 can be ascribed to the shrinkage of phase space for the production of massive pair , since the maximum partonic centre - of - mass energy is reduced to @xmath54 .",
    "the kinematic of the scattered proton induces peculiar features on muon pair production whose effects are presented in fig .",
    "( [ fig:2 ] ) in terms of the muon pair rapidity , y , in various bins of @xmath16 .",

    "( [ fig:4 ] ) we present single differential distributions as a function of @xmath16 in four different invariant mass ranges . as the invariant mass increases , we observe a progressive flattening of the distributions at small @xmath16 .",

    "such distributions offer an insight to the sensitivity of the cross section to diffractive parton distributions , modulo kinematics effects . in the lowest @xmath16",

    "the asymmetry , integrated over all masses and proton energy loss , the asymmetry reaches its maximum 3% at @xmath63 and is always negative , implying that the muon - pair is produced mostly in the emisphere opposite to the one containing the scattered proton .",
    "the asymmetry , being normalised to the integrated single diffractive cross section , is not affected by uncertainties due to the rapidity gap survival factor and it is sensitive to the shape of diffractive pdfs .",
    "depending on the accuracy of the data , this predicted behaviour , absent in the inclusive case , could be expolited to correlate the forward proton detection with the central drell - yan production .",
    "as discussed at the beginning of the section , predictions are affected by large theoretical errors associated with scale variations .",
    "such uncertainties can be conveniently reduced by considering the ratio @xmath64 of diffractive to inclusive cross sections @xmath65 which also offers the advantage to reduce experimental systematics errors . in eq .",
