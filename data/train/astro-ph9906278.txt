    "recent @xmath5-band imaging with keck i of the transient low - mass x - ray binary aquila x-1 (= v1333 aql ) has resolved v1333 aql into two stars lying approximately along the east - west direction and separated by 0.46  ( callanan et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the easterly star contributing 60% of the combined flux at @xmath5 . observations in the @xmath6-band ( 1.05@xmath7 ) indicated also that the easterly star was `` somewhat bluer '' and they speculated that it might be the true optical counterpart of aql x-1 .    in 1999",
    "we obtained @xmath1 and @xmath0-band frames of aql x-1 both in quiescence and during outburst maximum with efosc-2 at the eso 3.6-m telescope .",
    "we present here the results of our photometry and of our efosc-1 spectroscopy , and we show that the westerly star is the true counterpart .",
    "three dithered 5-min @xmath1-band exposures and 3 dithered 5-min @xmath0-band exposures ( using actually a gunn @xmath8 filter ) were obtained on 1999 april 9 with the imaging spectrograph efosc-2 at the cassegrain focus of the eso 3.6-m telescope at la silla , using a loral / lesser ccd ( # 40 ) with 15@xmath7 pixels , yielding a projected pixel size of 0.157 .",
    "conditions were clear , the seeing was 1  for the @xmath1 frames and 0.8  for the @xmath0 frames .",
    "after standard midas reduction procedures , the medianed @xmath1 and @xmath0 frames were measured using the daophot _ nstar _",
    "routine of stetson ( @xcite ) .",
    "a clean point spread function ( psf ) profile was derived from three nearby isolated stars after three neighbour - removing iterations .",
    "two comparison stars , c1 and c2 , situated ( 12.7n , 8.7s ) and ( 14n , 25s ) respectively from aql x-1 , were used to derive the @xmath1 and @xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "their johnson - cousins magnitudes , measured at observatoire de haute - provence with the 1.2-m telescope , are @xmath1 = 17.48 , @xmath0 = 16.12 for c1 and @xmath1 = 17.42 , @xmath0 = 16.29 for c2 ( chevalier and ilovaisky @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate the accuracy of these magnitudes to be 0.05 mag in each band .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have shown that the true optical counterpart of the aquila x-1 recurrent transient is the interloper reported by callanan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , located 0.48  west of the star previously assumed to be the candidate , now an ordinary mid to late - g type star .",
    "photometry and low - resolution spectroscopy obtained in quiescence give for the new counterpart @xmath1 = 21.6 and @xmath2 = + 2.2 and suggest a star of k7 v spectral type , reddened by @xmath3 = 0.5 @xmath40.1 and located at 2.5 kpc .",
    "this makes aql x-1 similar to most other soft x - ray transients which have late k ( or m0 ) companions .",
    "we defer examination of the consequences of this new identification on existing optical photometry to a forthcoming article ( chevalier and ilovaisky@xcite ) .",
