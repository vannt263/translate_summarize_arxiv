    "one of the most sensitive tests of the qcd mechanisms for the production of heavy quarkonium is the polarization of the @xmath0 in hadron collisions .",
    "in fact , there are serious disagreements between leading twist qcd prediction @xcite and experimental data @xcite on the production cross section of ` direct ' @xmath0 and @xmath5 we would like to advocate that polarization of @xmath0 provides strong constraints on the production mechanisms of @xmath0 and thus can pinpoint the origin of these disagreements .    in this paper we will present some preliminary results on the theoretical calculation of the polarization of @xmath0 in @xmath3 collisions .",
    "the completed analysis will be published in a later paper@xcite .",
    "we found that the polarization of @xmath0 provides important constraints on the nature of the production mechanisms and urge that polarization measurement of @xmath0 should be included in the design of future charm production experiment .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in section 2 , we show that from the experimental data on the production cross sections and leptonic decay widths of direct @xmath0 and @xmath6 , the long distance physics of formation of bound states of @xmath7 can be separated from the short distance physics of production of the @xmath7 pair .",
    "thus , the perturbative analysis is under control in calculating @xmath0 production even though the mass of charm quark is not much larger than @xmath8 once the validity of perturbative method is established , we calculate the production cross sections of direct @xmath0 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 in @xmath3 collisions in pqcd . these results are presented in section 3 and discrepancies are observed .",
    "we show that , in comparison with the recent e705 and e672 data @xcite , the predicted ratio of direct @xmath0 production compared to the @xmath10 production is too low by a factor of about 3 . in addition",
    "the production ratio of production cross sections of @xmath9 to @xmath10 is too low by a factor of 10 compared to data .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached in @xcite .",
    "the polarization data of @xmath0 @xcite allows us to make further conclusion of the origin of the disagreements . in section 4 , we find that even if the relative production rates of the @xmath11 and @xmath10 are adjusted ( using @xmath12-factors ) to agree with the data , the @xmath0 polarization data is still not reproduced .",
    "therefore , the discrepancies do not arise from an incorrect relative normalization of the various channels and new production mechanisms are needed .",
    "we will present our conclusion in the last section .",
    "in leading twist qcd , the production of the @xmath0 at low transverse momentum occurs both ` directly ' from the gluon fusion subprocess @xmath13 [ fig .",
    "1a ] and indirectly via the production and decay of @xmath9 and @xmath10 states .",
    "these states have sizable decay branching fractions @xmath14 of 27% and 13% , respectively .    in this model",
    ", we assume that the non - perturbative physics , which is described by the wave function at the origin in cases of production of @xmath0 and @xmath6 , is separable from the perturbative hard subprocess , @xmath15 factorization holds . as the wave function at the origin",
    "can be related to the leptonic decay amplitude [ fig .",
    "1b ] , the ratio of @xmath6 to direct @xmath0 production can be expressed in terms of the ratio of their leptonic decay width .",
    "more precisely , taking into account of the phase space factor , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the cross section for direct production of the @xmath0 .",
    "the ratio ( [ psiprime ] ) should hold for all beams and targets , independently of the size of the higher twist corrections in producing the point - like @xmath7 state .",
    "the energy should be large enough for the bound state to form outside the target .",
    "the available data is indeed compatible with ( [ psiprime ] ) . in particular ,",
    "the e705 value @xcite is @xmath18 . in table 1 ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath6 to direct @xmath0 production with different projectiles is presented .",
    "they are all consistent with the value @xmath19    .production cross sections for @xmath6 , direct @xmath0 and their ratio in @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 collisions .",
    "the data is from ref .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath10 production rate in qcd agrees with the data within a ` @xmath12-factor ' of order @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "this is within the theoretical uncertainties arising from the @xmath0 and @xmath25 wavefunctions , higher order corrections , structure functions , and the renormalization scale .",
    "a similar factor is found between the lowest - order qcd calculation and the data on lepton pair production @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "table 2 shows a considerable discrepancy between the calculated and measured relative production rates of direct @xmath0 and @xmath9 , compared to @xmath10 production .",
    "priori _ we would expect the @xmath12-factors to be roughly similar for all three processes .",
    "we conclude that leading twist qcd appears to be in conflict with the data on direct @xmath0 and @xmath9 production .",
    "although in table 2 we have only compared our calculation with the e705 and wa11 @xmath21 data , this comparison is representative of the overall situation ( for a recent comprehensive review see @xcite ) .",
    "the polarization of the @xmath0 is determined by the angular distribution of its decay muons in the @xmath0 rest frame . by rotational symmetry and parity ,",
    "the angular distribution of massless muons , integrated over the azimuthal angle , has the form @xmath26 where we take @xmath27 to be the angle between the @xmath28 and the projectile direction ( _ i.e. _ , we use the gottfried ",
    "jackson frame ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 can be calculated from the @xmath7 production amplitude and the electric dipole approximation of radiative @xmath25 decays .",
    "the electric dipole approximation of the radiative decay @xmath30 is exact in the heavy quark limit ; _ i.e. _ , when terms of @xmath31 are neglected . as a consequence ,",
    "the heavy quark spins are conserved in the decay , while the orbital angular momentum changes .",
    "the lowest order subprocess @xmath32 only produces @xmath10 with @xmath33 states asumming that the transverse momenta of the incoming gluons are neglected . in the @xmath33 polarization state",
    "the spin and orbital angular momenta of its constituent charm quarks are aligned , @xmath34 .",
    "since @xmath35 is conserved in the radiative decay @xmath36 , it follows that @xmath37 ( @xmath38 for the @xmath0 ) .",
    "thus the @xmath0 s produced via @xmath10 decay are transversely polarized , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath39 in ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "this result is exact if both the photon recoil and the intrinsic transverse momenta of the incoming partons are neglected .",
    "smearing of the beam parton s transverse momentum distribution by a gaussian function @xmath40 $ ] would bring @xmath29 down to @xmath41 .    from the @xmath42 amplitude we find for direct @xmath0 production , @xmath43 , @xmath44    \\label{direct_distribution}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "where @xmath45 is the @xmath46 branching fraction , @xmath47 is the longitudinal - momentum fraction of the @xmath0 , and @xmath27 is the muon decay angle of eq .",

    "( [ lambda ] ) in the gj - frame as a function of @xmath56 , separately for the direct @xmath0 and the @xmath57 processes .",
    "direct @xmath0 production gives @xmath58 , whereas the production via @xmath9 results in @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath60-distribution obtained when both the direct and indirect @xmath0 production processes are taken into account is shown in fig .",
    "2b and is compared with the chicago ",
    "princeton @xcite and e537 data @xcite for 252 gev @xmath61 collisions and 150 gev @xmath62 collisions respectively .",
    "our qcd calculation gives @xmath63 for @xmath64 , significantly different from the measured value @xmath65 .",
    "the discrepancies between the calculated and measured values of @xmath29 is one further indication that the standard leading twist processes considered here are not adequate for explaining charmonium production .",
    "the @xmath0 polarization is particularly sensitive to the production mechanisms and allows us to make further conclusions on the origin of the disagreements , including the above discrepancies in the relative production cross sections of @xmath0 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . if these discrepancies arise from an incorrect relative normalization of the various subprocess contributions ( _ e.g. _ , due to higher order effects )",
    ", then we would expect the @xmath0 polarization to agree with data when the relative rates of the subprocesses are adjusted according to the measured cross sections of direct @xmath0 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 production polarization significantly @xcite , which makes it plausible to represent these corrections by a simple multiplicative factor , which does not affect the polarization of the photon . ] . the dashed curve in fig .",
    "2b shows the effect of multiplying the partial @xmath0 cross sections with the required @xmath12-factors .",
    "the @xmath29 parameter is still predicted incorrectly over most of the @xmath56 range .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached ( within somewhat larger experimental errors ) if we compare our calculated value for the polarization of direct @xmath0 production , shown in fig .  2a , with the measured value of @xmath29 for @xmath6 production .",
    "in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ psiprime ] ) , the @xmath6 polarization data should agree with the polarization of directly produced @xmath0 s , regardless of the production mechanism . based on the angular distribution of the muons from @xmath68 decays in 253 gev @xmath69 collisions , ref .",
    "@xcite quotes @xmath70 for @xmath71 , appreciably smaller than our qcd values for direct @xmath0 s in fig .",
    "we have seen that the @xmath0 and @xmath9 hadroproduction cross sections in leading twist qcd are at considerable variance with the data , whereas the @xmath10 cross section agrees with measurements within a reasonable @xmath12-factor of @xmath23 to @xmath24 . on the other hand ,",
    "the inclusive decays of the charmonium states based on the minimal perturbative final states ( @xmath52 and @xmath72 ) have been studied in detail using perturbation theory @xcite , and appear to work fairly well .",
    "it is therefore improbable that the treatment of the @xmath7 binding should require large corrections .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the fact that the relative rate of @xmath6 and direct @xmath0 production ( eq .  [ psiprime ] ) , which at high energies should be independent of the production mechanism , is in agreement with experiment .    in a leading twist description ,",
    "an incorrect normalization of the charmonium production cross sections can arise from large higher order corrections or uncertainties in the parton distributions@xcite .",
    "taking into account that the normalization may be wrong by as much as a factor of 10 and that even such a @xmath73factor does not explain the polarization data of @xmath0 , a more likely explanation may be that there are important higher - twist contributions to the production of the @xmath0 and @xmath9 as suggested in large @xmath56 case @xcite .",
    "further theoretical work is needed to establish that the data on direct @xmath0 and @xmath9 production indeed can be described from higher twist mechanisms .",
    "experimentally , it is important to check whether the @xmath0 s produced indirectly via @xmath10 decay are transversely polarized .",
    "this would show that @xmath10 production is dominantly leading twist , as we have argued .",
    "thus , the polarization of @xmath0 production from different channels provides a very sensitive discriminant of different production mechanisms ."
