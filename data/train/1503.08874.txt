    "the x - ray transient swift j1357.2 - 0933 ( hereafter j1357.2 ) was discovered in outburst on 28 jan 2011 with the burst alert telescope on - board _ swift _ ( krimm et al .",
    "follow - up observations with the _ swift _ x - ray telescope revealed a spectrum consistent with an absorbed power law with a low hydrogen column density @xmath5 of @xmath6 @xmath7 and a photon index that evolved from @xmath8 to 2.1 during the outburst decline ( krimm et al . 2011b , armas padilla et al . 2013 ) .",
    "a 0.5 - 10 kev outburst peak luminosity of @xmath9 erg s@xmath2 is inferred from these observations .",
    "in addition , xmm - newton data obtained on 5 feb 2011 could be fitted with a three component model : the above mentioned power law with a 93 percent contribution to the total flux , a thermal ( disc ) component with @xmath10 kev , and one edge at 0.73 kev .",
    "the thermal component is interpreted as soft emission originating in the accretion disc , while the edge is associated to interstellar iron .",
    "the low x - ray peak luminosity together with the evolution ( softening ) of the power - law dominated spectrum , the low temperature for the thermal component associated to the accretion disc and the detection of radio emission ( sivakoff , miller - jones & krimm 2011 ) are in accordance with the source being a black hole system in the low - hard state through the entire outburst . in this",
    "regard , timing analysis of both the xmm - newton data as well as contemporaneous rxte proportional counter array observations showed a power spectrum with characteristics more similar to those detected in the low - hard state of black holes than neutron stars ( armas padilla et al .",
    "2014a ) . on the other hand , early in the outburst a",
    "6 mhz quasi - periodic oscillation was detected in one of the rxte observations .",
    "this low frequency is atypical in black holes and more common in dipping neutron stars ( see armas padilla et al .",
    "2014a for details ) .",
    "j1357.2 was observed in quiescence with xmm - newton on 10 july 2013 and detected at a 0.5 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity of @xmath11 erg s@xmath2 ( armas padilla et al .",
    "the x - ray spectrum in quiescence is consistent with an absorbed power law with @xmath12 , although fits to single thermal models were also permitted by the data .",
    "the optical and near - infrared counterparts to j1357.2 were identified with a @xmath13 and @xmath14 mag star = 13:57:16.829 and @xmath15= -09:32:38.75 as provided by sdss ] ( rau et al .",
    "a high - resolution optical spectrum obtained on 2 february 2011 showed no clear indication for emission lines , lack of diffuse interstellar bands and the presence of weak absorption lines from the interstellar na doublet ( torres et al .",
    "a low - resolution spectrum taken one day later exhibited weak and broad h@xmath0 and h@xmath16 emission lines with the former having 7   equivalent width ( ew ) and @xmath17 km s@xmath2 full width at zero intensity ( fwzi ; milisavljevic et al .",
    "high - resolution h@xmath0 spectroscopy undertaken on 25 - 27 february 2011 resolved the very broad double - peaked line profile with a peak - to - peak separation of @xmath18 km s@xmath2 ( casares et al . 2011 ) .",
    "further time - resolved observations allowed corral - santana et al .",
    "( 2013 ) to find a @xmath19 hr modulation in radial velocities extracted from the h@xmath0 line profile .",
    "assuming this periodicity corresponds to the orbital period and using the line peak - to - peak separation to constrain the radial velocity semi - amplitude of the donor star to @xmath20 km s@xmath2 , a mass larger than @xmath21 m@xmath22 is estimated for the compact object .",
    "complementary time - resolved optical photometry did not show any evidence for variability with the above periodicity ( corral - santana et al .",
    "the light curves show dipping variability with a recurrence time that gradually increases from 2.3 min to 7.5 min over 69 days of follow - up photometry .",
    "the recurrent optical dips ( up to 0.8 mag ) are interpreted as obscuration events caused by a toroidal structure with asymmetric height with respect to the orbital plane . in this scenario",
    ", the changes in the dipping frequency would imply that this structure is moving inside - out the disc during outburst . in order to produce the profound dips in the light curve ,",
    "a very large system inclination is necessary .",
    "however , neither the optical data nor the x - ray data showed dips or eclipses due to the donor star ( armas - padilla 2013a , corral - santana et al .",
    "2013 ) . to explain the non detection of these features in the light curve , corral - santana et al .",
    "( 2013 ) invoke an accreting binary configuration in which the mass ratio is low enough to have a roche - lobe filling donor star with a radius smaller or similar to the disc outer rim .",
    "the optical counterpart to j1357.2 was also identified in quiescence at @xmath23 in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) images taken in may 2006 ( rau et al .",
    "based on the sdss pre - outburst colors and assuming no disc contribution to the optical light , the donor star was tentatively classified as an m4 dwarf at @xmath24 kpc distance .",
    "this is in good agreement with the m4.5 donor at @xmath25 kpc expected from a roche - lobe filling donor in a 2.8 hr orbital period system ( corral - santana et al .",
    "however , time - resolved photometry during quiescence at different post - outburst epochs ( shahbaz et al . 2013 ) reveals a very different picture : the donor star is not the dominant source of light at optical or infrared wavelengths .",
    "the multicolor light curves lack evidence of any orbital variability caused by the donor star , i.e.  ellipsoidal modulations , eclipses or dip features .",
    "instead the photometry shows flares of up to @xmath24 mag and @xmath26 mag at optical and infrared wavelengths , respectively .",
    "this is the largest flare amplitude known in quiescent black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "moreover , the dipping behaviour observed in outburst persists in quiescence but with a @xmath27 min recurrence time .",
    "both the optical to mid - infrared quiescent spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and optical variability sed of j1357.2 can be described by a single power - law model with index @xmath28 .",
    "this steep power - law together with the high amplitude flickering are interpreted as due to synchrotron emission from a variable , weak jet that dominates the sed over the donor star light ( shahbaz et al .",
    "2013 ) . using the relation between orbital period and the outburst optical amplitude , shahbaz et al .",
    "constrain the distance towards j1357.2 to be between 0.5 and 6.3 kpc .",
    "the lack of accurate dynamical parameters and observational details of the accretion disc structure during quiescence motivated us to perform time - resolved optical spectroscopy .",
    "we begin with a description of the observations and data reduction steps ( section 2 ) .",
    "the average optical spectrum of j1357.2 in quiescence is presented in section 3 where we also characterize the h@xmath0 line profile and constrain its variability . finally , the results are presented and discussed in section 4 , where we examine key questions such as the orbital parameters and space velocity for the system .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "time - resolved optical spectroscopy of j1357.2 was obtained with the focal reducer and low dispersion spectograph 2 ( fors2 , appenzeller et al .",
    "1998 ) which is mounted on the cassegrain focus of the 8.2-m eso unit 1 very large telescope at paranal , chile .",
    "the observations were obtained in service mode under program 091.d-0865(a ) during 14 april 2013 5:37 - 6:22 ut , 18 april 2013 4:35 - 8:00 ut and 4 may 2013 4:12 - 4:57 ut .",
    "fors2 was used with the standard resolution collimator and the @xmath29 pixels mit two ccds mosaic detector binned @xmath30 to provide a 0.25 pixel@xmath2 scale .",
    "the instrument was operated in long - slit mode with the 600 line mm@xmath2 grism gris_600ri .",
    "j1357.2 was centered in a 1.0 wide slit with its location offset from the ccd center .",
    "this instrumental setup yields a dispersion of 1.6    pixel@xmath2 , a coverage in the spectral range @xmath31 and a slitwidth - limited resolution of @xmath32    full - width half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "a total of six one hour - long observing blocks ( obs ) were executed consisting of four spectroscopic integrations of 640 s each .",
    "four , sixteen and four spectra were collected on 14 april at @xmath33 , 18 april from @xmath34 1.04 to 1.43 and 4 may at @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "we measure from the width of the source spatial profile at spectral positions covering h@xmath0 an image quality between @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the first , second and third nights , respectively and a mean @xmath39 fwhm from the three nights .",
    "therefore the observations were obtained in seeing - limited conditions yielding a spectral resolution of @xmath40    fwhm corresponding to 140 km s@xmath2 at h@xmath0 .    the spectra were reduced and extracted using standard techniques implemented in the starlink , figaro , and pamela packages while the wavelength calibration was done with molly .",
    "the data reduction consisted of de - biasing and flat - fielding the data .",
    "the spectra were extracted using the algorithm of horne ( 1986 ) to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio of the resulting spectra .",
    "exposures using comparison arc lamps were performed after the end of each night in order to establish the pixel - to - wavelength scale .",
    "this was derived through polynomial fits to 27 arc lines .",
    "the rms scatter of the fit was always @xmath41  , which is less than @xmath42 of the wavelength dispersion .",
    "the sky [ oi ] @xmath43 lines and the oh emission blend at 7316.3   showed that wavelength zeropoint disparities reached up to @xmath44 km s@xmath2 in amplitude .",
    "these deviations were corrected for by applying to the spectra zeropoint shifts calculated using the [ oi ] @xmath45 emission feature .",
    "the resulting 24 spectra were normalized by dividing each of them by a low - order spline fit to the continuum after masking out emission lines and atmospheric absorption bands .",
    "finally , the resulting spectra were rebinned to a uniform pixel scale .",
    "since all the observations were seeing limited , systematic effects due to excursions of the target position with respect to the slit centre may affect the radial velocity determinations presented in this work .",
    "in this regard , j1357.2 was centered on the slit at the start of each ob execution , except perhaps during the last two obs on 18 april . for these",
    "obs we lack the re - acquisition and through - slit images commonly saved when the centering is checked or performed during service mode observations .",
    "in what follows we will conservatively assume that for both obs the centering step was skipped .",
    "hence , positional departures from the exact slit center and changes in the target position during the spectroscopic exposures have certainly happened .",
    "unfortunately we lack the data required to quantify and correct for this effect ( see e. g. bassa et al .",
    "section 2.4.3 in the eso fors2 manual ( issue 92.0 ) offers constraints on the image motion for a given @xmath46 due to instrument flexures .",
    "this motion increases with @xmath46 .",
    "as our observations were performed after culmination , @xmath46 increased monotonously and it is therefore reasonable to assume that the offsets in the target position accumulate .",
    "thus , we estimate a cumulative offset @xmath47 ( binned ) pixels at the end of the execution of the single obs during 14 april and 4 may .",
    "the cumulative offsets at the end of the four obs executed on 18 april are estimated to be @xmath48 binned pixels .",
    "the systematic effects could therefore have introduced radial velocity offsets ( at h@xmath0 ) from @xmath49 to @xmath50 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we have measured the positional offsets along the spatial direction . for this",
    "we have calculated the centroid for the spatial profile of j1357.2 at h@xmath0 in all spectra .",
    "the centroids differ by < 0.3 ( binned ) pixels .",
    "this suggests that the cumulative positional offsets in the dispersion direction during 18 april may be smaller than estimated if they have a similar amplitude to that measured for the offsets in the spatial direction .",
    "in fig . 1 , we present the result obtained by averaging the 24 individual fors2 spectra .",
    "the averaged data show no evidence for photospheric features from the donor star such as the tio bands characteristic of m - type stars .",
    "the interstellar sodium doublet found in outburst by torres et al .",
    "( 2011 ) is not obvious due to the low reddening towards the source and the fact that this feature falls on top of the hei @xmath51 emission line .",
    "all significant absorption features in the spectrum are caused by the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by a prominent broad and double - peaked h@xmath0 emission line together with weaker emission lines of hei @xmath52 .",
    "hei @xmath51 is also double - peaked while hei @xmath53 is partially resolved from the h@xmath0 line red wing . at red wavelengths",
    "there is no obvious emission from paschen lines or the two caii triplet components covered by the data .",
    "the apparent emission feature at @xmath54 is not coincident with any of the above hydrogen or caii lines and it is most likely an artifact .",
    "the mean h@xmath0 and hei @xmath51 double - peaked line profiles were fitted with 1 and 2-gaussian functions using the marquardt algorithm ( bevington 1969 ) . from the 1-gaussian fit",
    "we derive the line fwhm given in table 1 .",
    "the 2-gaussian model allows us to measure the velocity shifts of the blue ( @xmath55 ) and red ( @xmath56 ) peaks with respect to the line rest wavelength .",
    "their difference @xmath57 ( peak - to - peak separation ) and mean @xmath58 ( centroid of the line ) are included in table 1 .",
    "this table also lists the measured full - width at zero intensity ( fwzi ) and equivalent widths ( ews ) for h@xmath0 and hei @xmath59 .",
    "the mean fwhm for h@xmath0 is consistent with the @xmath60 km s@xmath2 fwhm found for this line in low - resolution spectroscopy obtained on 29 april 2013 ut ( shahbaz et al . 2013 ) , although on that occasion the line profile appeared single peaked and with @xmath61   ew .",
    "this value is below the maximum ew observed when studying the time variability of h@xmath0 ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "the mean peak - to - peak velocity separations for the h@xmath0 and hei @xmath51 lines are @xmath62 km s@xmath2 and @xmath63 km s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "this difference suggests that the hei emission line originates from regions in the disc closer to the black hole than the regions responsible for the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the fwhm and velocity separation of the double peaks in the h@xmath0 line ( table 1 ) are a factor 1.2 - 1.3 larger than the values reported during outburst ( @xmath64 km s@xmath2 fwhm and @xmath65 km s@xmath2 , corral - santana et al .",
    "this difference is expected for a disc with a keplerian velocity field since during outburst the disc increases its radius , thereby decreasing the velocity of the outer disc regions.the @xmath66    fwzi of the h@xmath0 and hei @xmath51 implies projected velocities @xmath67 and @xmath68 km s@xmath2 for the inner part of the accretion disc emitting at these wavelengths",
    ". the fwzi found for h@xmath0 is a factor @xmath25 larger than observed at different times during the outburst ( milisavljevic et al .",
    "2011 , see also fig . 1 in corral - santana et al .",
    "this difference in fwzi can be explaned if the luminosity of the continuum decreased quicker than the luminosity of the emission lines when the source went from outburst to quiescence .",
    "we studied the variability of the h@xmath0 line with diverse methods .",
    "these included single and 2-gaussian model fitting , the double - gaussian technique described by shafter et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and line ew measurements .",
    "the results obtained from these techniques are shown in fig .",
    "2 . a single gaussian fit to the line profiles yields radial velocities ranging from -189 to + 118 km s@xmath2 .",
    "these radial velocities reflect variations in the peak - to - peak intensities rather than changes in the line centroid ( see below ) .",
    "the change in the double - peak intensity from almost symmetric peaks to enhanced red - shifted or blue - shifted peaks is obvious in fig .",
    "3 where we show the line profiles .",
    "even though this behavior could be naively attributable to an s - wave originating in a hot spot and/or the donor star , further inspection of the individual data in fig .",
    "3 shows that the presence of such a narrow component is not obvious .",
    "in addition , these variations in the profile structure can also not be explained as due to the eclipse of the accretion disc by the donor star .",
    "in such a scenario the blue - shifted disc emission is first eclipsed while the red - shifted emission is eclipsed afterwards since the donor star initially occults disc regions moving towards the observer and subsequently blocks the receding regions from view .",
    "this is a distinctive rotational disturbance of the line profiles during eclipse , the so - called z - wave .",
    "thus the changes in the h@xmath0 line profile of j1357.2 do not show the z - wave characteristic of emission line eclipses .",
    "the variations in the peak intensities are likely due to a highly variable non - uniform disc brightness distribution or / and departures from an axisymmetric flat disc . in this regard ,",
    "we observe changes of up to 10 percent in the peak - to - peak separation over successive spectra ( see below ) .",
    "the short - term ( sub - orbital ) changes in the h@xmath0 line profile morphology are reminiscent of those observed in the black hole low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) gro j0422 + 32 ( @xmath69 hr , q=0.12 ) in quiescence ( see fig . 1 in filippenko et al .",
    "another variable feature in the line shape is the depth of the central absorption delimited by the two line peaks .",
    "while the averaged line profile shows a moderately deep absorption , the individual spectra reveal that its depth can vary significantly during consecutive spectra . as observed in the first night ( top - left panel fig.3 ) ,",
    "the absorption core passes from being near the continuum level in the first spectrum to well above the continuum in the next one .",
    "such deep cores are expected from discs observed at high inclination ( see discussion ) .",
    "radial velocities were also derived with the double - gaussian technique ( shafter et al .",
    "1986 ) which consists of convolving the line profiles with two gaussian bandpasses with separation @xmath70 . after several trials , we chose to use a 200 km s@xmath2 fwhm for both gaussians .",
    "the separation @xmath70 between the gaussians was varied from 2300 km s@xmath2 to 6000 km s@xmath2 in steps of 100 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the radial velocity curves obtained with gaussian separations",
    "@xmath71 km s@xmath2 displayed a modulation with a higher amplitude than found in the radial velocities determined with a 1-gaussian fit .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "2 the results for a gaussian separation of 2800 km s@xmath2 . at gaussian separations",
    "larger than @xmath72 km s@xmath2 , the radial velocities obtained with the double - gaussian technique show no obvious modulation .",
    "ideally the wings of disc emission lines should trace the motion of the compact object .",
    "in fact , by applying the above technique to their outburst data , corral - santana et al .",
    "( 2013 ) recovered radial velocity modulations beyond @xmath73 km s@xmath2 - note here that the h@xmath0 line profile was narrower during outburst . in this way they were able to estimate the orbital period and the radial velocity semi - amplitude of the primary ( @xmath74 km s@xmath2 ) for j1357.2 .",
    "our failure to do this could be primarily due to the systematic effects affecting the radial velocities ( section 2 ) .",
    "the systematic velocity shifts could be comparable to or larger than @xmath75 . additionally , systematic effects are expected due to contamination of the red line wing by the overlapping hei @xmath53 emission line .",
    "the 2-gaussian model was employed to calculate both the peak - to - peak separation and the line centroid .",
    "the changes in the line morphology from near - symmetric to asymmetric double - peaked velocity profiles were taken into consideration when calculating these parameters .",
    "this was done because the gaussian component accounting for the weaker peak in the line will fit also part of the broader base of the profile .",
    "this yields a velocity that could be significantly offset from the real peak position in question . to avoid this possible bias effect we examined each individual fit and rejected from our analysis @xmath55 and @xmath56 when either of the related gaussian components had @xmath76 km s@xmath2",
    "this limit proved to be an effective quantitative way to select strongly ( eight in total ) asymmetric profiles - for comparison the fwhms of the 2-gaussians fit to the mean profile in section 3.1 is @xmath77 km s@xmath2 .",
    "note also that this non - physical two component model yields reduced @xmath78 to 1.4 , providing therefore statistically sound fits . by using profiles",
    "for which both gaussian components have @xmath79 km s@xmath2 ( 16 spectra ) , we derive a mean peak - to - peak separation of @xmath80 km s@xmath2 and centroid of @xmath81 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the uncertainties here and below correspond to the rms scatter .",
    "we also calculated the above line parameters by including velocity shifts obtained from the asymmetric profiles .",
    "for these profiles only one of the 2-gaussian components in the fit is narrow ( @xmath82 km s@xmath2 fwhm ) yielding @xmath55 ( 7 spectra ) or @xmath56 ( 1 spectrum ) . taking the mean of all the reliable velocity shifts ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) , we derive @xmath85 km s@xmath2 and @xmath86 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the results from both calculations are fully consistent . the temporal variability for these two line parameters derived from the 2-gaussian model fitting is also displayed in fig .",
    "2 ( top and middle panels ) . on 18 april",
    "the line centroid shows no clear modulation with velocities ranging from -222 km s@xmath2 to -50 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the amplitude of the variations is lower than that obtained from velocities derived with the 1-gaussian model ( 300 km s@xmath2 amplitude ) and double - gaussian technique ( 650 km s@xmath2 ) . on 4",
    "may the line centroid is constant during the 45 min length of the observations with a mean value of @xmath87 km s@xmath2 . during the three nights the peak - to - peak separation ranges from 2200 to 2530 km s@xmath2 .",
    "variations in the peak - to - peak separation can occur in short intervals as observed on 14 april and 5 may when in a @xmath88 min interval changes of @xmath89 and @xmath90 km s@xmath2 in amplitude take place .",
    "the fast changes ( sub - orbital ) in the peak - to - peak separation and intensities indicate that there are azimuthal variations in the outer disc velocities or structures .",
    "the h@xmath0 ew varies irregularly as shown in the bottom of fig .",
    "2 . with our 640s integration , the ew ranges values from @xmath91 to @xmath92   with a mean of @xmath93  .",
    "the 14 april ew curve lacks any evidence for a decrease or increase in the line ew due to eclipses of the disc by the donor star .",
    "a decrease in the ew would occur at and near mid - eclipse if the disc regions responsible for the continuum and line are obscured from view by the donor star . on the other hand ,",
    "an increase in ew can be associated with emission line regions in the disc that are not tightly confined to the orbital plane and thereby visible during eclipse .",
    "examples of the increase in the h@xmath0 ew at eclipse time can be found in the neutron star lmxb sources x1822 - 371 ( @xmath69 hr ; harlaftis et al .",
    "1982 ) and exo 0748 - 676 ( @xmath94 hr ; pearson et al .",
    "none of these characteristics are present in the ew curve which appears dominated by erratic variations . for comparison with other black hole lmxbs in quiescence ,",
    "the strength of h@xmath0 is not above than that found in gro j0422 + 32 ( @xmath95 to @xmath96  ; harlaftis et al .",
    "1999 ) .      in order to search for signatures of the donor star that could have been canceled out by averaging the data , we cross - correlated the individual spectra against sdss stellar templates covering spectral types between f and m. the cross - correlation was performed over sections free of telluric and emission line features .",
    "no cross - correlation functions were discernable from this analysis .    in an attempt to corroborate the 2.8 hr orbital period , we performed doppler tomography on the h@xmath0 line by phase folding the data over different trial periods and adopting a systemic radial velocity of -150 km s@xmath2 ( see section 4.2 ) .",
    "the tomograms ( not shown ) lead to variable asymmetries in the disc emission , but not to the extent that there was a clear favoured period . the reason why we were unable to use the tomographic reconstruction to constrain the orbital period is the lack of an s - wave that would have resulted in a strong emission feature in the tomogram .",
    "our optical spectroscopy of j1357.2 during quiescence shows no evidence for absorption features from the donor star .",
    "we therefore make use of the strong double - peaked h@xmath0 emission line to set constraints on the system parameters . for this",
    ", comparison will be drawn between the spectroscopic and photometric properties of j1357.2 and those observed in relevant types of accreting binaries such as accretion disc corona ( adc ) systems and ultra - compact binaries with a white dwarf accretor ( better known as am cvn systems ) .",
    "adc sources are persistent lmxbs with an orbital inclination of @xmath97 .",
    "am cvn systems have in common with short orbital period black hole lmxbs a low mass ratio @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the mass of the donor star and accreting object , respectively .",
    "assuming an axisymmetric disc with gas in keplerian motion , the projected motion of the outer edge of the disc @xmath101 can be used to constrain the radial velocity semi - amplitude of the donor star ( @xmath102 ) given that @xmath103 .",

    "1994 ) . in this way it has been found that @xmath104 is between 1.11 and 1.47 ( table 2 in orosz et al . 2002 ) . using this empirical relationship and the h@xmath0 line observed in outburst , corral - santana et al .",

    "for this they adopted @xmath106 ( orosz et al .",
    "1994 , orosz & bailyn 1995 ) and took into account that , since the source is in outburst , the peak - to - peak separation is less than @xmath107 during quiescence . following a similar approach , we constrain @xmath102 to be @xmath108 km s@xmath2 ( @xmath109 km s@xmath2 ) by conservatively using @xmath110 during quiescence , the observational fact that @xmath111 and @xmath112 km s@xmath2 as found from the averaged h@xmath0 profile during quiescence ( section 3.1 ) .",

    "additional velocity components are usually present .",
    "they are due , for instance , to emission from the gas stream , hot spot and/or donor star .",

    ". the tidal action of the donor on the outer parts of the disc can excite spiral shock patterns or cause the disc to elongate and precess .",
    "disc precession can dominate the orbital - averaged velocity shifts observed in the emission line centroid .",
    "these contributions to the velocity profile can make it difficult to reliably establish @xmath3 or @xmath119 from time - resolved spectroscopy of emission lines ( see e.g. orosz et al . 1994 and sec 7.5 in shahbaz et et al .",
    "2013 ) .    in what follows we present and",
    "discuss three pieces of observational evidence that indicate that the @xmath120 km s@xmath2 offset of the h@xmath0 line centroid in j1357.2 most likely represents ( within the errors ) the systemic radial velocity : first , as reported in section 3.2 .",
    "the double - peaked h@xmath0 line profiles lack the presence of any narrow line component with velocity position modulated with the orbital motion .",
    "therefore , j1357.2 shows no s - wave associated to emission from confined regions in the accretion flow ( as discussed above ) that can produce a radial velocity offset in an averaged line profile when the orbital phase coverage during the observations is non - uniform .",
    "s - waves are features commonly present in the time - resolved spectra of accreting binaries , but exceptions exist where this feature is not detected or is very weak . this is the case in gro j0422 + 32 for which no s - wave was present in h@xmath0 spectroscopy during quiescence ( harlaftis et al .",
    "see also mason et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and levitan et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for examples of lack of / weak s - waves in a 1.8 hr dwarf nova and in an am cvn system , respectively .",
    "second , the average radial velocity offset found during quiescence is fully consistent with the @xmath3 velocity of @xmath121kms@xmath2 that can be derived from the diagnostic diagram for this balmer line during outburst ( fig",
    ". s2 in corral - santana et al . 2013 ) .",
    "third , corral - santana et al . found @xmath3 and a periodic ( likely orbital ) modulation from spectroscopic data obtained in two outburst epochs separated by @xmath88 days .",
    "the detection of an orbital modulation in the combined data sets is possible if any additional velocity shifts in the line centroid on a timescale longer than the orbital period were small or if they had similar magnitude and sign at the time of the observations . for cvs and lmxbs with @xmath122 ,",
    "long - term line shifts are expected during outburst due to disc eccentricity and precession .",
    "the formation of such a disc is attributed to the tidal influence of the donor star over a disc that during outburst radially expands to reaches the 3:1 resonance radius ( see e.g. hirose & osaki 1990 , whitehurst & king 1991 ) .",
    "the variations in the emission line centroids observed in xte j1118 + 480 ( @xmath123",

    "2002 , torres et al .",
    "2004 ) and am canum venaticorum ( @xmath124 min , @xmath125 ; roelofs et al .",
    "2006 ) provide evidence for the existence of large amplitude velocity shifts driven by a precessing disc . when present they can make it difficult to recover any orbital modulation superimposed on the lines by using data sets spanning many orbits and lacking enough orbital phase coverage at each epoch of observation .",
    "it appears therefore that long - term changes in the line centroid due to a precessing accretion disc were small or absent in j1357.2 ( at least ) at the time of the spectroscopic observations .    in support of the possibility of a non - precessing disc on j1357.2",
    "is the absence of superhumps in the outburst light curves presented in corral - santana et al .",
    "superhumps are photometric modulations that are driven by outbursts and characterized by having a periodicity a few percent longer than the actual orbital period . this photometric behaviour is explained as due to the presence of the elliptical and precessing disc .",
    "superhumps have been found during the outburst decline of the short orbital period black hole lmxbs gro j0422 + 32 ( odonoghue & charles 1996 ) , xte j1118 + 480 ( uemura et al . 2000 , zurita et al .",

    "hr , zurita et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the apparent lack of superhumps in j1357.2 is striking , but not impossible given that these features do not necessarily develop or persist during all outbursts .",
    "a clear example is the eclipsing am cvn system sdss j0926 + 3624 ( @xmath127 min , @xmath128 ) which exhibited superhumps in an outburst in 2006 and lacked these features in an outburst with similar brightness amplitude that occurred in 2009 ( copperwheat et al .",
    "alternatively , the considerable dipping in the outburst light curve of j1357.2 might not have permitted the detection of the superhump signal which has been argued to be of low amplitude for high inclination lmxbs ( haswell et al . 2011 ) . however , see mason et al .",

    "( 2008 ) for the detection of superhumps in the adc neutron star system ms 1603.6 + 2600 ( @xmath129 hr ) .    in summary ,",
    "the absence of s - wave components in the h@xmath0 line during quiescence , the similar values of the averaged line centroid during quiescence and the @xmath3 measured during outburst together with the apparent lack during outburst of significant long - term changes in the line strongly support the claim that the averaged centroid of the h@xmath0 line closely represents the systemic radial velocity of j1357.2 . since our radial velocities could have been affected to a greater or lesser degree by systematic effects ( section 2 ) , we prefer and adopt for the rest of the discussion the value of @xmath130 km s@xmath2 derived in corral - santana et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .      since the distance to j1357.2",
    "is poorly constrained ( 0.56.3kpc ) and the proper motion is unknown , we can not draw definitive conclusions on the space velocity of the source .",
    "given the high galactic latitude of j1357.2 ( @xmath131 ) the range of possible distances implies that the source lies between 0.4 and 4.8kpc above the galactic plane . with the known position and systemic radial velocity ( @xmath132kms@xmath2 )",
    ", we can compute the galactic space velocity components @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 for a grid of possible proper motions ( in both right ascension and declination ) and distances , using the transformations of johnson & soderblom ( 1987 ) .",
    "we find that the @xmath135 velocity component ( motion perpendicular to the galactic plane ) is directed back towards the plane , unless the proper motions are large enough that the velocity components parallel to the plane of the disc deviate significantly ( by @xmath136kms@xmath2 ) from the standard galactic rotation at 240kms@xmath2 ( reid et al .",
    "this would imply that the source was originally at an even larger distance from the galactic plane .",
    "either it is a halo object , or ( more likely ) was formed in the disc and subsequently launched into an extremely elliptical orbit by a significant natal kick during the supernova explosion in which the black hole was formed , as also inferred to have occurred in gro j1655 - 40 ( brandt , podsiadlowski & sigurdsson 1995 ) and xte j1118 + 480 ( mirabel et al .",
    "2001 ) .    to place better constraints on",
    "the space velocity of j1357.2 would require knowledge of the source proper motion .",
    "however , since the quiescent counterpart of j1357.2 is fainter than gaia s limiting magnitude of @xmath137 , an accurate proper motion for j1357.2 would require vlbi observations , either of the ( as - yet undetected ) quiescent radio emission , or of future transient outbursts ( e.g.  mirabel et al .",

    "an edge - on nature for j1357.2 , as proposed to explain the profound dips in the optical light curves ( corral - santana et al .",

    "( 2014a ) the x - ray spectrum during outburst shows an excess of soft emission attributable to non - occulted inner regions of the accretion disc .",

    "2014a ) or in high - inclination neutron star lmxbs ( boirin et al .  2005 ;",
    "daz trigo & boirin 2013 ) .",
    "furthermore , there is another significant difference between j1357.2 in outburst and x - ray bright high - inclination systems ( not necessarily adc sources ) .",
    "in addition to extinction from interstellar matter , the @xmath5 as measured in x - ray spectral fits usually includes the absorption associated to matter local to the source .",
    "the latter can be the dominant contribution to @xmath5 when reddening towards the source is very low .",
    "in several high - inclination systems the @xmath5 determined from x - ray spectral fits is indeed dominated by extinction local to the source .",
    "for instance , ultraviolet observations have enabled reliable determinations of the interstellar reddening e(b - v ) towards exo 0748 - 676 and x2127 + 119 ( which have @xmath94 hr and @xmath138",

    "the @xmath5 found for dipping and/or eclipsing lmxbs when using the out - of - dips or eclipse x - ray emission is typically of the order of @xmath143 @xmath7 as found for ms 1603.6 + 2600 ( @xmath129 hr , hakala et al .",

    "2011 ) to estimate the interstellar reddening towards j1357.2 . the resolved na d1 and d2 components , have @xmath147   and @xmath148  , respectively .",
    "we derive @xmath149 from the na d1 line ew using the calibration of munari & zwitter ( 1997 ) and 0.05 from the na d2 ew assuming a d2/d1 ratio of 2 ( optically thin limit ) .",

    "possibly , the scale height of the material responsible for the local @xmath5 enhancement is lower in j1357.2 , or alternatively , the system inclination is lower than that of the high inclination systems we compared with . but this seems to suggest that the inclination in j1357.2 is lower than what has been suggested previously and probably @xmath153 .",
    "this would explain the lack of disc eclipses in the continuum or h@xmath0 lines .",
    "nevertheless , the orbital inclination of j1357.2 can not be too low given the observed emission line characteristics .",
    "in particular , the depth of the absorption core defined by the line peaks is similar to that observed during quiescence in eclipsing cvs ( marsh & horne 1987 ) and is a strong indicator that the system has a high orbital inclination ( horne & marsh 1986 ) . we conclude that the inclination of j1357.2 is probably between 7080@xmath154 .",
    "optical spectra of j1357.2 during quiescence were analyzed in this work .",
    "the average data shows a continuum lacking photospheric lines from the donor star .",
    "thus we spectroscopically prove that synchrotron emission from a jet and/or thermal emission from the accretion disc fully veil the light contribution from the donor star at optical wavelengths .",
    "broad strong h@xmath0 and weaker hei emission lines are present in the data .",
    "the time - resolved h@xmath0 line profile shows no strong s - wave patterns or other obvious periodic behavior such as z - wave caused by eclipses .",
    "we also find that no large long - term radial velocity shifts were present , either at the time of our spectroscopy , or of the spectroscopy acquired in outburst .",
    "thus the data supports a systemic velocity @xmath4 km s@xmath2 on the basis of the average radial velocity properties . from the h@xmath0 peak - to - peak separation",
    "we constrain @xmath155 to be @xmath156 km s@xmath2 and @xmath157 .",
    "we estimate an interstellar absorption column towards the source of @xmath158 @xmath7 which is comparable to that derived from x - ray fitting and lower than expected from an edge - on source .",
    "therefore the low x - ray brightness and spectral shape during outburst are unlikely due to a geometric effect ( accretion disc corona system ) and they are consistent with the source being in the low - hard state during the entire outburst .",
    "although j1357.2 appears not to be one of the many missing eclipsing black - hole lmxbs , the system has high inclination as inferred from the emission line morphology . finally , we infer that the present galactic kinematics of j1357.2 are such that its @xmath135 space velocity component is directed towards the galactic plane unless the proper motion is substantial .",
