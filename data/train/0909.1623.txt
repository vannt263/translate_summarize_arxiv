    "is used in the filter banks , it is natural to ask if a sub - band decomposition scheme could be developed which is based on the dtlct . in particular , we want to know how a filter - bank can be designed that splits the dtlct spectrum of an input signal into two sub - band signals .      in this paper the sampling rate conversion theorems derived in @xcite are used to develop a sub - band decomposition scheme based on dtlct .",
