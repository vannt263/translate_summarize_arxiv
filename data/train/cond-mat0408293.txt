    "many of the electron - electron interaction effects in condensed - matter and astrophysical plasmas can be understood by reference to the homogeneous electron - gas model .",
    "a central role is played by the electron - pair distribution function @xmath0 , which describes how short - range exchange and correlations enter to determine the probability of finding two electrons at a relative distance @xmath3 .",
    "most of the theoretical and computational studies of this model have been concerned either with the limit of complete quantum degeneracy at zero temperature  @xcite or with the classical limit at very high temperature  @xcite . in a number of physical situations , however , the state of the electrons is in neither of these limiting regimes .",
    "some studies of the equation of state of the three - dimensional ( @xmath4 ) electron gas in the temperature - density plane were reported most notably by ichimaru and coworkers  @xcite and by macke and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the excess free energy of the electron gas at any temperature t can be calculated from the temperature and density dependence of @xmath0 by integration over the coupling strength parameter .",
    "accurate and theoretically well founded methods have been developed in recent years for the calculation of @xmath0 in both the @xmath4 and the @xmath5 electron gas at @xmath6 .",
    "here we are specifically concerned with the approach originally proposed by overhauser  @xcite for the evaluation of the value @xmath7 of the pair function at contact .",
    "writing @xmath0 in the paramagnetic state as the average of the distributions for parallel- and antiparallel - spin electron pairs , @xmath8/2 $ ] , one has that @xmath9 vanishes on account of the pauli principle and @xmath10 is solely determined by two - body scattering events . in overhauser s model @xmath10 was obtained from the solution of a schrdinger equation for the relative motion of two electrons with antiparallel spins in an effective interaction potential which also accounts for many - body effects from the electron gas .",
    "this approach was later extended to evaluate @xmath0 at finite @xmath3 as a sum of contributions from two- body wave functions (  geminals \" ) , the geminal weights being determined by the distribution of relative momentum for a pair of electrons in the electron gas  @xcite .    in the present work we extend to finite temperature the approach of davoudi _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , which was based on a self - consistent hartree model for the effective scattering potential .",
    "section 2 summarizes the method used for the evaluation of the pair wave functions from the solution of an effective two - body schrdinger equation in dimensionality @xmath1 and @xmath2 , while section 3 presents the calculation of the temperature - dependent geminal weights needed to construct the pair distribution function .",
    "some illustrative numerical results for @xmath0 are presented and discussed in section 4 , and finally section 5 offers a brief summary and some perspectives for future work .",
    "the thermodynamic variables that characterize the states of the gas in dimensionality @xmath11 are the electron density @xmath12 and the temperature @xmath13 . it is convenient to introduce the wigner - seitz density parameter @xmath14 by the usual relation @xmath15^{1/d}$ ] , where @xmath16 is the bohr radius and @xmath17 is the solid angle in @xmath11 dimensions ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "we shall measure the thermal energy in @xmath20 units by introducing a reduced temperature @xmath21 .",
    "as in the gas at zero temperature  @xcite , we aim to solve the two - electron scattering problem with some effective interaction potential @xmath22 in order to determine the wave functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the parallel- and antiparallel - spin states of an electron pair .",
    "here , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the relative coordinate and the center - of - mass coordinate of the pair , the conjugate momenta being @xmath27 and @xmath28 . the spin - resolved pair distribution functions @xmath29 can then be obtained as @xmath30 represents averages over the scattering angle @xmath31 and over the probability @xmath32 of finding two electrons with relative momentum @xmath33 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) can also be written as a double sum of the radial components of the pair wave functions over angular momenta and relative momentum , the weight of each term in the latter sum being determined by the function @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "carrying out the angular - momentum expansions of the pair wave functions and performing the angular averages leads to the results @xmath34 and @xmath35\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) the sum over @xmath38 runs over odd integers , because the spinor associated with the @xmath39 state is symmetric and hence the coordinate part of the wave function is antisymmetric under exchange .",
    "the spinor associated with the @xmath40 state has instead no definite symmetry and hence the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) runs over all integer values of @xmath38 . the schrdinger equation obeyed by the radial wave functions @xmath41 is @xmath42\\phi^{(d)}_{\\ell , { \\bf k}}(r)=\\frac{\\hbar^2k^2}{m}\\,\\phi^{(d)}_{\\ell , { \\bf k}}(r)\\ ] ] where @xmath43 , with @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath47 : the negative values of @xmath38 are accounted for by the choice @xmath37 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and  ( [ eq3 ] ) ) . in solving eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) we impose as a boundary condition that @xmath41 tends asymptotically to the free solution corresponding to @xmath48 , except for a phase shift .    in our calculations",

    "the system of equations  ( [ eq2])-([eq5 ] ) is to be solved self - consistently after determining the momentum distribution @xmath32 as a function of temperature , as we do in the next section within a free - electron model .",

    "( i ) the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ensures that the relation @xmath51 is satisfied , since all functions @xmath41 vanish at the origin for @xmath52 ; ( ii ) the cusp condition on @xmath53 at the origin  @xcite is satisfied if @xmath22 tends to the bare coulomb potential for @xmath54 , as imposed in eq .",

    "the probability distribution @xmath32 of finding two electrons with relative momentum @xmath33 is given by @xmath62 the prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) is obtained from the normalization condition @xmath63 , and the factor @xmath64 in the argument of the second fermi - dirac function takes care of the fact that @xmath65 is the relative momentum of the two colliding electrons .    at @xmath6",
    "the chemical potential is equal to the fermi energy @xmath66 , with @xmath67 being the fermi wave number ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) , and simple analytic expressions are available for @xmath32 ( see ref .   and references given there ) . in the limit of high temperature @xmath60 approaches the value @xmath70}$ ] where @xmath71 is the thermal de broglie wavelength , and eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) yields the asymptotic result @xmath72 numerical calculation is necessary at any finite temperature . in @xmath2",
    "the specific form of the density of single - particle states yields the analytical result @xmath73}\\,.\\ ] ]    the dependence of @xmath60 on the reduced temperature @xmath74 is shown in fig . 1 at @xmath75 over a wide temperature range ( recall that room temperature corresponds to @xmath76 ) .",
    "2 we show the momentum distribution @xmath32 as a function of @xmath77 at @xmath78 in @xmath1 and at @xmath75 in @xmath2 .",
    "the effects of temperature are evident from the figure : ( i ) @xmath32 acquires a high - momentum tail extending beyond the zero - temperature cut - off at @xmath79 ; and ( ii ) its peak moves to higher momenta from its zero - temperature position at @xmath80 in @xmath1 and @xmath81 in @xmath2 .",
    "we report in figures 3 and 4 our numerical results for the temperature shifts of the pair distribution function in the @xmath4 electron gas at @xmath78 and in the @xmath5 gas at @xmath75 .",
    "these shifts are qualitatively similar in both dimensionalities and can be said to be relatively small , if we bear in mind the magnitude of the unit of measure that we have adopted for the reduced temperature .",
    "evidently , these results reflect temperature - induced changes in the state of short - range order in the gas .",
    "three ranges of values for the reduced distance @xmath82 need to be separately examined : ( i ) the region of the main peak at @xmath83 , lying near @xmath84 in @xmath1 and near @xmath85 in @xmath2 , where thermal agitation is seen to reduce the magnitude of two - body correlations ; ( ii ) the intermediate region around @xmath86 , where the conditioned probability of finding a second electron at distance @xmath3 from an electron at the origin is instead enhanced ; and ( iii ) the region of close contact at distances approaching @xmath87 , where again thermal agitation reduces the magnitude of @xmath0 .",
    "the behaviour of the pair correlations in the first two regions above clearly reflects the increase in the mean kinetic energy with temperature , which is associated with the broadening of the distribution of relative momentum displayed in figure 2 .",
    "this enhances the tunnelling probability of a second electron into the potential barrier created by the electron at the origin and tends to smear out the first - neighbour shell at a given value of the coupling strength .",
    "such a reduction in the state of short - range order leads us to expect that the phase boundary between the gas and the wigner crystal will shift with increasing temperature to higher values of @xmath14 ( _ i.e. _ to stronger effective coulomb coupling ) .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath0 in the third region above was first noticed in the work of macke and coworkers  @xcite , relating to the @xmath4 gas in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "their interpretation was that the width of the potential barrier surrounding the electron at the origin is also increasing with temperature , thus inhibiting deep penetration by a second electron .",
    "our results in figs . 3 and 4",
    "confirm this property of the electron gas as persisting in the intermediate - coupling regime and in lowered dimensionality .",
    "in summary , we have solved the two - electron scattering problem in the electron gas at finite temperature within the self - consistent hartree approximation , to display the changes in the state of short - range order that are brought about by thermal excitation .",
    "the results achieved in previous work on pair correlations in the electron gas at zero temperature  @xcite immediately suggest what would be important improvements in the present approach , especially in regard to the @xmath5 case and with a view to using the theory to construct reliable phase diagrams in a thermodynamic space spanned by density , temperature , and spontaneous spin polarization .",
    "two directions seem worth exploring : ( i ) the inclusion of a spin dependence of the effective scattering potential , as developed in the work of kukkonen and overhauser  @xcite ; and ( ii ) the derivation and study of differential equations obeyed directly by the pair distribution functions at finite temperature , rather than by their angular - momentum components .    as a final comment , we may recall that in the classical limit the density and temperature dependence of @xmath0 are determined by three- and four - body distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "the expression for the temperature derivative of @xmath0 can then be shown to relate to the heat capacity of the classical fluid _ via _ a fluctuation formula .",
    "the thermodynamics of a fermi gas may also be worth studying from this viewpoint .",
