    "the motion of atoms in a liquid can be divided into two constituent : ( a ) oscillation in a valley of the liquid s many - body potential and ( b ) transits between many - body valleys .",
    "the latter process is responsible for self - diffusion . as we showed in a previous paper @xcite , which drew upon earlier results of clements and wallace @xcite",
    ", the former motion can be modeled very precisely under the assumption that the valleys are nearly harmonic , with the majority of valleys ( the random valleys ) sharing a common spectrum of frequencies .",
    "specifically , a purely harmonic model provides an extremely accurate formula for @xmath0 , the normalized velocity autocorrelation function , in the nondiffusing regime . here",
    "we will use this picture and our previous work to justify a `` mean atom trajectory '' model , a single - atom model that approximates the behavior of an average atom in the liquid and correctly reproduces its nondiffusing behavior .",
    "then we will introduce a simple intuitive account of the transit process that allows us to extend the model to the self - diffusing regime . in sec.[model ] we develop this model and explain how it is used to calculate @xmath0 for a diffusing liquid .",
    "then we fit the model to md simulations at various temperatures in sec .",
    "[ md ] , and we comment on the quality of the results . in sec .",
    "[ concl ] we compare the present mean atom trajectory model with previous work based on instantaneous normal modes ( inm ) , and with an earlier independent atom model @xcite , and we summarize our conclusions .",
    "to form an appropriate basis for our model , we must begin with some initial reasonable approximations about the nature of the valleys and transits in the real liquid . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", available evidence suggests that the valleys are nearly harmonic , and we will continue to assume that here .",
    "further , we will assume that transits between valleys occur instantaneously and are local in character ; that is , each transit involves only a few neighboring atoms .",
    "now for the nondiffusing supercooled liquid , there are no transits , and as we ve seen the system s motion is accurately expressed in terms of the harmonic normal modes .",
    "but it is also legitimate to consider this motion from the point of view of a single atom , and when we do so we see that each atom moves along a complicated trajectory within a single - particle potential well which fluctuates because of the motion of neighboring atoms , but whose center is fixed in space .",
    "an important timescale for this motion is the single - atom mean vibrational period @xmath1 , which we take as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the rms frequency of the set of normal modes .",
    "let us now follow the single - atom description as the temperature is increased .",
    "once the glass transition is passed , the atom will begin to make transits from one single - particle well to another @xcite , and even before the melting temperature is reached , the transit rate will be on the order of one per mean vibrational period .",
    "since each atom has approximately ten neighbors , roughly ten transits will occur in its immediate vicinity every period , changing the set of normal mode eigenvectors each time ; thus we conclude that a decomposition of the motion into normal modes will not be useful when the liquid is diffusing , so we have no choice but to follow a single - atom description for the liquid state @xcite .",
    "that being the case , we shall start from the beginning with a single - atom description , in order to construct a unified model for diffusing and nondiffusing motion alike .",
    "our starting point will be in the nondiffusing regime , where a normal mode analysis is still valid . as shown in @xcite , the @xmath4th coordinate of the @xmath5th atom in an @xmath6-body harmonic valley",
    "can be written @xmath7 where the @xmath8 form a @xmath9 orthogonal matrix , the @xmath10 are the frequencies of the normal modes , and the @xmath11 are the amplitudes of the modes .",
    "three of the modes have zero frequency and correspond to center of mass motion ; here we demand that the center of mass is stationary , so the system has only @xmath12 independent degrees of freedom , the zero frequency modes are absent , and the sum over @xmath13 runs from 1 to @xmath12 . to make this an equation for",
    "a `` mean '' atom , we first drop the index @xmath5 : @xmath14 now we must reinterpret the @xmath15 since they no longer form an orthogonal ( or even square ) matrix .",
    "let @xmath16 so @xmath17 we will ultimately consider situations in which the well center is allowed to move , so let @xmath18 be the atom s position , be the location of the center of the well , and @xmath18 be the atom s displacement from the well center ; then @xmath19 with velocity @xmath20    we now have the basic formula , but we must decide how to assign values to the @xmath21@xmath22 , @xmath11 , and @xmath23 .",
    "let s do this by calculating @xmath24 , the velocity autocorrelation function , in this model and comparing it to the harmonic result derived in @xcite .",
    "@xmath25 let s assign the @xmath23 randomly and average over each @xmath23 _ separately _ ; then if @xmath26 , @xmath27 but if @xmath28 , then @xmath29 thus the @xmath26 terms in eq .",
    "( [ 1stz ] ) are eliminated and we have @xmath30 note that the formula for @xmath24 in the harmonic theory also lacks off - diagonal terms @xcite , but for a different reason : the orthogonality of the matrix @xmath8 removes them in that case .",
    "now let us make the assignment @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a randomly chosen unit vector ; then @xmath33 this is the same expression for @xmath24 that one derives in the harmonic model ( see eq .",
    "( 10 ) of @xcite ) for _ any _ distribution of normal mode amplitudes @xmath11 , not just the thermal equilibrium distribution .",
    "thus our model with these choices of @xmath23 and @xmath22 correctly reproduces @xmath24 for any equilibrium or nonequilibrium ensemble in the harmonic theory . to recover the equilibrium result",
    ", we make the final substitution @xmath34 with the result @xmath35 which is eq .",
    "( 13 ) from @xcite .",
    "thus our model assumes that the motion of a mean nondiffusing atom in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 where the phases @xmath23 and unit vectors @xmath32 are randomly chosen .    by construction this model",
    "gets the same result for @xmath24 , and thus @xmath38 , as the harmonic model ; does it correctly reproduce any other functions ?",
    "we can check by calculating the analog of @xmath24 for positions , @xmath39 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ uharmoft ] ) for @xmath40 and calculating for the harmonic model as in @xcite , and using eq .",
    "( [ u1oft ] ) for @xmath18 and calculating as above , one finds in both cases that @xmath41 again the substitution @xmath42 recovers the correct thermal equilibrium result .",
    "so this model correctly reproduces @xmath43 and @xmath44 as well .",
    "notice that because we have a closed form for @xmath18 , all of the correlation functions calculated so far also have a closed form .",
    "once we introduce transits , this will no longer be the case .    while this model compares well with the harmonic model",

    "note that in both graphs @xmath45 has approximately the same amplitude , and the gaps between peaks are roughly the same size , indicating oscillations at frequencies in the same ranges .",
    "thus not only functions of the motion but the motion itself shows strong qualitative agreement with md in the nondiffusing regime .",
    "the md system with which we will be comparing our model has @xmath48 particles , so it has 1497 normal mode frequencies .",
    "( remember that the zero frequency modes are removed at the start . )",
    "when we introduce transits , we will have to evaluate @xmath24 numerically , and for speed of computation we would like to use only a representative subset of the normal mode frequencies , say 75 instead of all 1497 .",
    "the original set of frequencies is determined as described in @xcite .",
    "we decided which subset to use by calculating three moments of the full frequency distribution defined below : @xmath49^{1/2 } \\nonumber \\\\ \\omega_{0 } & = & \\exp \\langle \\ln(\\omega_{\\lambda } ) \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ \\omega_{-2 } & = & \\left [ \\frac{1}{3 } \\langle \\omega_{\\lambda}^{-2 } \\rangle                     \\right]^{-1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that by this definition @xmath50 .",
    "we then calculated the same three moments for several sets of 75 frequencies evenly spaced throughout the full set , and we chose the set that best fit the moments to use in further calculations .",
    "this process is somewhat subjective , because skewing the sample in favor of lower frequencies improves the accuracy of @xmath51 but reduces the accuracy of @xmath52 , and the opposite is true if one skews in favor of high frequencies .",
    "the table below shows the values of the moments for the full set and the reduced set of 75 that we ultimately chose .",

    "the five md runs is that its first minimum is rising with increasing @xmath36 ; as we mention below , this is the primary reason for the increasing diffusion coefficient @xmath67 . note that the model is able to reproduce this most important feature quite satisfactorily .",
    "in fact , all five fits of the model to the md results capture their essential features , but we do see systematic trends in the discrepancies . first , note that the location of the first minimum barely changes at all in the model as @xmath65 is raised , but in md the first minimum moves steadily to earlier times as the temperature rises .",
    "the first minimum occurs at a time roughly equal to half of the mean vibrational period ( @xmath68 in this system ) , so the steady drift backward suggests that the md system is sampling a higher range of frequencies at higher @xmath36 .",
    "also , for the three lowest temperatures the model tends to overshoot the md result in the vicinity of the first two maxima after the origin , and at the highest two temperatures this overshoot is accompanied by a positive tail that is slightly higher than the ( still somewhat long ) tail predicted by md .",
    "these overshoots should clearly affect the diffusion coefficient @xmath67 , which is the integral of @xmath24 . to check this , we calculated the reduced diffusion coefficient @xmath69 , the integral of @xmath0 , which is related to @xmath67 by @xmath70 the results are compared to the values of @xmath69 calculated from the md runs in fig .",
    "the results from the two nondiffusing runs discussed in @xcite are also included .     as a function of @xmath36 for both the model and md .",
    "]    in all of the diffusing cases , the model overestimates @xmath69 by roughly the same amount , which we take to be the effect of the overshoots at the first two maxima . at the higher temperatures the discrepancy is also higher , presumably due to the model s long tail .",
    "it is interesting to note that this md system produces results that agree very closely with experiment : for example , the md predicts that at @xmath60 k and @xmath71 g/@xmath72 , @xmath73 @xmath74/s , while experiments by larsson , roxbergh , and lodding @xcite find that at @xmath60 k and @xmath75 g/@xmath72 , @xmath76 @xmath74/s .",
    "hence our agreement with md results genuinely reflects agreement with properties of real liquid na .",
    "we have presented a single - atom model of a monatomic liquid that provides a unified account of diffusing and nondiffusing behavior .",
    "the nondiffusing motion is modeled as a sum of oscillations at the normal mode frequencies ( eq .  ( [ uoft ] ) ) , simulating the trajectory of an average atom in a complicated single - body potential well that fluctuates due to the motion of its neighbors .",
    "self - diffusion is accounted for in terms of instantaneous transits between wells , which occur at a temperature - dependent rate @xmath65 .",
    "since this model gives a simple and straightforward account of the motion itself , it can easily be used to calculate any single - atom correlation function one wishes ; here we have focussed on the velocity autocorrelation function .",
    "it is interesting to note that in this model the velocity correlations persist through a transit , instead of being washed out entirely by the transit process ; we will return to this point below .",
    "the relaxation of correlations seen by the decay of @xmath0 arises here from two distinct processes : dephasing as a result of the large number of frequencies in the single - well motion , and transits between wells .",
    "the dephasing effect produces relaxation but not diffusion : it causes @xmath0 to decay @xcite but its integral remains zero . on the other hand , transits certainly contribute to relaxation ( see @xcite , where they provide the only relaxation mechanism ) , but in addition they raise the first minimum of @xmath0 substantially , increasing its integral and providing a nonzero @xmath67 .",
    "the comparison of this model to md results is generally quite positive , particularly for a one - parameter model ; the two calculations of @xmath0 agree strongly over 1000 timesteps .",
    "in addition , the match is encouraging over a very large range of temperatures , from essentially 0 k to @xmath77 .",
    "the most noticeable discrepancies are the backward drift in the location of the first minimum of @xmath0 , which is present in md but not the model , and the tendency of the model to exaggerate certain characteristics of the md results ( the maxima at intermediate times and the high-@xmath36 positive tail ) .",
    "this latter effect is responsible for the model s overestimate of the diffusion coefficient , though we hasten to add that the model @xmath69 is still in satisfactory agreement with md results , especially for the liquid at @xmath78 ( see fig .",
    "[ dvst ] ) .    as in @xcite ,",
    "it is useful to compare this model and the accompanying results to the work others have done using the formalism of instantaneous normal modes ( inm ) and similar methods .",
    "previously , we discussed the advantages of our general approach and the superior quality of its results when applied to nondiffusing states ; here we will consider matters relating explicitly to mechanisms of diffusion .",
    "as is noted explicitly by vallauri and bermejo @xcite , the account of inm by stratt ( see , for example , @xcite ) does not consider at all ; their @xmath24 is essentially a sum over cosines , and as such it integrates to zero .",
    "this is understandable , because as stratt et al .",
    "repeatedly emphasize , their approximation is valid only for very short times , so they are not attempting to model effects with longer timescales .",
    "they compare their results with md calculations of @xmath0 for states of an lj system ranging from a moderately supercooled liquid to well above the melting temperature , and our fits are of roughly the same quality or better in all cases .",
    "authors who do attempt to model diffusion usually follow the path suggested initially by zwanzig @xcite , who thought of the liquid s phase space as divided into in which each atom spends its time before finding a saddle point in the potential and jumping from one cell to the next .",
    "he imagined as a first approximation that the jumps destroy all correlations between the cells ; since atoms are jumping all the time , he suggested that the net result was to multiply the nondiffusing form of @xmath24 by a damping factor @xmath79 for some timescale @xmath1 representing the lifetime of a stay in a single cell .",
    "notice that zwanzig provided no dynamical model of the jumping process itself .",
    "this suggestion has been developed and transformed extensively by madan , keyes , and seeley @xcite , who take a general zwanzig - like functional form for @xmath24 and use a combination of heuristic arguments and constraints on its moments to specify its dependence on a `` hopping rate '' @xmath80 , the analog of @xmath66 for zwanzig , which they then extract from the unstable lobe of the inm spectrum .",
    "although we can not be entirely sure , as indicated in @xcite , we think it most likely that their simulations of lj ar at 80 k , 120 k , and 150 k consist of states comparable to our figs .",
    "[ 216.3kvsmodel ] and [ 309.7kvsmodel ] , and again we would argue that our fits are somewhat better .",
    "finally , cao and voth @xcite also approach diffusion by means of a damping factor , and they consider factors of two different types , each of which contains parameters that can be determined from other calculated or experimental quantities .",
    "their matches with md are actually quite good , but again ours are of at least comparable quality .",
    "having claimed that our matches to md simulations are as good as or better than all of the others we have surveyed , let us emphasize a fundamental difference between our approaches to diffusion : we provide an account of the _ process _ of transiting from well to well , so we have a model of the actual _ motion _ of a mean atom in space that is valid to arbitrary times , and given this model we can _ calculate _ the effect of transits on correlations .",
    "all other approaches we know of begin with an account of the motion valid only for very short times , calculate @xmath24 from this motion , and then try to model the effects of diffusion on @xmath24 directly , using parameters that are thought to be characteristic of jumps between wells . in the diffusing regime ,",
    "no one else we have seen actually calculates @xmath81 to find @xmath24 , as we do . in the process",
    ", we find that some of the assumptions made by others , in particular zwanzig s hypothesis that jumps between wells simply erase correlations , are not true .",
    "this approach is already yielding insights into the actual motion of an atom undergoing a transit .",
    "finally , we would like to compare the present mean atom trajectory model with an earlier independent atom model by wallace @xcite . in developing the independent atom model ,",
    "two arguments were made : ( a ) the high rate of transits in the liquid state shows the need to abandon the normal mode description of motion , and instead picture the motion of a single atom among a set of fluctuating wells , and ( b ) the leading approximation to a fluctuating well is its smooth time average well .",
    "accordingly , the independent atom oscillates with frequency @xmath82 in a smooth isotropic well , and it transits with probability @xmath83 to an adjacent identical well at each turning point @xcite .",
    "what we have now learned by considering low temperatures , and especially the nondiffusing states of @xcite , is that the md system exhibits a velocity decorrelation process which results from the presence of many frequencies in the single - particle motion , making assumption ( b ) less reasonable . in the current model these many frequencies",
    "are retained , and they are intended to represent the strong fluctuations in each single - particle well ; in this way the current model makes an important improvement over the independent atom model , where the well fluctuations were averaged out . beyond this difference",
    ", the two models contain similar but not identical treatments of transits , whose rate increases with increasing temperature , and which produce self - diffusion .",
    "the less detailed but simpler independent atom model has proven useful in a description of the glass transition @xcite , and the corresponding transit parameter has been used to relate shear viscosity and self - diffusion in liquid metals @xcite ."
