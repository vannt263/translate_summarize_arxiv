    "the bubble plays a crucial role in many natural processes as well as in industrial practice or even in some industrial hazards  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one of the basic mechanisms of the formation of the bubble called homogeneous bubble nucleation ( cavitations ) has attracted continuous attention for many years from a fundamental point of view as well as from technological interests  @xcite .",
    "the _ homogeneous nucleation _ occurs within a bulk fluid that is under - saturated and is held at a pressure lower than its coexisting vapor pressure at the given temperature .",
    "then the fluid is said to be stretched .",
    "another mechanism of the formation is the _ heterogeneous nucleation _",
    ", where the bubble formation is induced by impurities in the liquid or by the wall of the container of the liquid .    a tiny embryo of bubble called the nucleus forms within the stretched fluid from thermal fluctuation .",
    "the work of formation @xmath0 of such a tiny bubble is positive , and has a maximum @xmath1 as the function of the size or radius of the embryo .",
    "the nucleus with this critical size corresponding to the maximum @xmath1 is called the critical nucleus .",
    "therefore , a bubble that is smaller than this critical size is unstable and will shrink and disappear immediately .",
    "as soon as the size of the embryo becomes larger than this critical size , it starts to increase its size as the larger bubble becomes more favorable energetically .",
    "thus the formation of bubbles is the activation process .",
    "the central quantities of the nucleation phenomena is the nucleation rate @xmath2 , which is the number of critical nuclei formed per unit time per unit volume .",
    "usually it is written in arrhenius form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a kinetic pre - exponential factor which is believed to be weakly dependent on temperature @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the boltzmann s constant .",
    "therefore , the temperature dependence of the nucleation rate is controlled by the work of formation @xmath1 .",
    "if any impurities or walls exist this will assist in lowering the necessary work @xmath1 , the nucleation occurs predominantly near the impurity or wall . then the nucleation is called heterogeneous nucleation .",
    "otherwise it occurs uniformly within the bulk and is called homogeneous nucleation .",
    "recently , corti  @xcite and coworkers have studied not only the bubble nucleation but the cavity or void formation within the stretched liquid using the monte carlo simulation  @xcite , the density functional method  @xcite and the thermodynamic perturbation method  @xcite for the lennard - jones fluid .",
    "they conjectured that    * _ conjecture 1_:the size of the critical cavity is a lower bound to the size of critical bubble .",
    "* _ conjecture 2_:the work of formation of the critical cavity is the upper bound to the work of formation of the critical bubble .    where the critical cavity is the largest cavity that can be created within the liquid without inducing vaporization  @xcite .",
    "a larger cavity will immediately drive the system to phase separation into the vapor phase . therefore the critical cavity represents the stability limit of the metastable liquid that contains the largest cavity .",
    "based on these observation , corti and coworkers  @xcite have conjectured that the homogeneous bubble nucleation is induced by the homogeneous cavity nucleation .",
    "the cavity nucleation could play an important role to induce subsequent bubble nucleation .",
    "then the _ homogeneous _ bubble nucleation could , in fact , be the _ heterogeneous _ nucleation where the _ homogenously _ nucleated cavity would play the role of a spherical impurity or surface to induce _ heterogeneous _ nucleation of bubble  @xcite .",
    "these conjectures , however , are based on the numerical results of the cavity in the lennard - jones system only .",
    "therefore , further confirmation of their findings using a more generic model is necessary .    in this paper",
    ", we will use a simple square - gradient density functional theory with a triple - parabolic free energy  @xcite to study the cavity introduced into the stretched liquid  @xcite . the density functional theory ( dft )",
    "is known to be more reliable than the classical nucleation theory ( cnt )  @xcite in particular near the spinodal  @xcite .",
    "the square gradient approximation to dft is also known to be qualitatively correct not only for the liquid with short - ranged interatomic potential  @xcite but also for the liquid with the long - ranged potential  @xcite .",
    "further approximation using parabolic free energy make this square - gradient density functional theory more attractive and generic as it does not depend on the detailed form of interatomic potentials .",
    "it has elucidated the various aspects of the critical bubble in stretched liquid  @xcite .",
    "for example , we  @xcite studied a scaling rule found for the lennard - jones system by shen and debenedetti  @xcite and found that the scaling rule is marginally satisfied .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present a short review of the triple - parabola model  @xcite to summarize the necessary formula . in section iii , we will present the numerical results and discuss the implications of the results in light of the conjectures of punnathanam and corti  @xcite .",

    "the radii @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the matching radius that satisfies @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "( [ eq:13 ] ) and ( [ eq:14 ] ) of the cnt regime , the size of the critical cavity @xmath56 will be relatively insensitive to the @xmath20 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and eq .",
    "( [ eq : xx2 ] ) that there exists a minimum size of the critical bubble , while the size of the critical cavity approaches zero .",
    "furthermore , the critical size @xmath56 of the cavity is smaller than the size of the critical bubble represented by the dividing radius @xmath39 from fig .",
    "[ fig:6](a ) . even though the critical size of the cavity is smaller than the bubble , it is also clear from fig .",
    "[ fig:6](b ) that the work of formation of the critical cavity is always larger than that of the critical bubble .",
    "since both the size of the critical cavity @xmath56 and the work of formation @xmath1 approaches zero as we move toward the spinodal , it is expected that the sub - critical cavity rather than much larger critical bubble could easily be formed and induce phase transformation from metastable liquid to vapor near the spinodal .",
    "the previous picture of homogeneous nucleation assumes that the long - wavelength fluctuation induces the critical bubble formation .",
    "near the spinodal , such a homogeneous nucleation called spinodal nucleation would occur cooperatively and the sudden and the rapid phase transformation could occur as the system becomes nearly unstable .",
    "our simple calculation using dft model indicates that this scenario of phase transition near the ( mean - field ) spinodal may not be true and the sub - critical cavity rather than the critical bubble could play some role to induce the rapid spinodal nucleation .",
    "in this work , we have studied the size and the work of formation of the critical cavity using a generic square - gradient density - functional model with triple - parabolic free energy .",
    "we have used this model as it is generic in the sense that it does not depend on the interatomic potential and it has already been used to study the scaling properties of the critical bubble  @xcite .",
    "we pay particular attention to the comparison of the critical cavity with the critical bubble of the homogeneous nucleation to check the conjecture made by corti and coworker  @xcite for the lennard - jones fluid .    aside from the fact that our dft model assumes constant compressibilities @xmath101 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) and a constant square - gradient coefficient @xmath102 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , it seems certain from our numerical results that the two conjecture made by punnathanam and corti  @xcite on the size and the work of formation of the critical cavity are valid . from the behavior of the critical cavity near the spinodal",
    ", sub - critical small cavity seems easier to form than the critical bubble in stretched fluid with negative pressure near the spinodal .",
    "this conclusion for the sub - critical cavity and critical bubble near the spinodal remain correct even if we include the diverging isothermal compressibility at the spinodal predicted from the @xmath33-field theory@xcite .",
    "then it could be argued that the sub - critical cavity  @xcite plays some role to induce critical bubble nucleation in the stretched fluid at least near the spinodal .",
    "if the sub - critical cavity plays the crucial role in liquid - to - vapor phase transformation ( vaporization ) , the real picture of the phase transformation should be more complex .",
    "then the real picture of phase transformation is totally different from the traditional picture based on the homogeneous nucleation where the phase transformation occurs through the formation of the critical bubble from the fluctuation and subsequent growth of the bubble .",
    "it would be , however , difficult experimentally to judge whether the phase transformation near the spinodal proceeds via the cavity or bubble as the liquid phase becomes nearly unstable near the spinodal where the fluctuation plays the dominant role and smears the detail of the phase transformation .",
    "finally , the dynamics of cavitations would be more interesting for practical purposes .",
    "various numerical methods such as the monte carlo  @xcite , the molecular dynamics  @xcite and the lattice boltzmann method  @xcite have been developed to study the dynamic of cavity or bubble formation and the evaporation .",
    "recently , we have developed a numerical method based on the time dependent ginzburg - landau model combined with the cell dynamics method to study the dynamics of nucleation in various situations  @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to use this cell dynamics method to study the dynamics of cavity or bubble formation .",
