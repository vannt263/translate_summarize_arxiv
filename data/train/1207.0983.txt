    "the natural title of the present paper would be `` new gibbs states for the ising model on the bethe lattice '' .",
    "however the subject of `` new states on the bethe lattice '' is not new for already a long time , and was discussed by many authors .",
    "so a better name might be `` all pure low - temperature states '' ( especially if it describes correctly what follows ) .    in spite of its simplicity , some questions in the area of statistical mechanics on trees are still open , and new phenomena are encountered .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 phases of the ising model on the bethe lattice ",
    "the translation invariant states @xmath3 and @xmath4  are known to be extremal below the critical temperature @xmath5 .",
    "an uncountable number of non - translation invariant pure states @xmath6 was constructed by blekher and ganikhodzhaev in @xcite .",
    "these states describe the coexistence of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states along different ` rigid interfaces ' @xmath7 , analogous to the dobrushin states in the 3d ising model .",
    "one should think about @xmath7 as a path , connecting two points ` at infinity ' of @xmath8 in what follows we will call these states as bg - states and denote them also by @xmath9 .",
    "the free state  @xmath10 , i.e. the one corresponding to ` zero ' or ` empty ' boundary condition is extremal in the interval below the critical temperature @xmath5 and above the critical temperature of the corresponding spin - glass model ( see @xcite ) . in particular , it is not extremal at low temperatures .",
    "one does not know the decomposition of @xmath10 into extremal states ( a question of a. van enter ) .",
    "we will formulate below our conjecture about this decomposition .",
    "later rakhmatullaev and rozikov @xcite introduced some new states , which they call weakly periodic states .",
    "their construction is somewhat indirect and uses various subgroups of the free group .",
    "in what follows we present an alternative construction of weakly periodic states , as well as the construction of many more pure states .",

    ". then the following theorem holds .",
    "the configurations @xmath22 and @xmath23 are ground state configurations .",
    "let @xmath38 be a ground state configuration , and @xmath39 be a connected finite set .",

    "denote by @xmath48 and @xmath49 the gibbs states corresponding to the boundary conditions @xmath22 and @xmath50 the quantification of the last statement allows us to show the following    [ lowt ] there exists a value @xmath51 of the temperature , such that for all temperatures @xmath52 and all collections @xmath33 satisfying @xmath53 the states @xmath48and @xmath49 are extremal gibbs states .",
    "( here the temperature @xmath51 does not depend on @xmath33 ) .",
    "these low - temperature gibbs states are small perturbations of the ground states @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the free energy of the states @xmath54 and @xmath55 is higher than that of the states @xmath3 , @xmath56and @xmath6 .",
    "1 .   @xmath57 in that case the states @xmath58 and @xmath59 are just the @xmath1 and @xmath60 states .",
    "2 .   in the case",
    "when @xmath33 consists from a single bond @xmath61 the states @xmath62 and @xmath63 are among the non - translation invariant states @xmath9 constructed by blekher and ganikhodzhaev in @xcite .",
    "the interface curve @xmath7 in that case is just the curve intersecting @xmath0 along the single bond @xmath64 the same is true for every finite collection @xmath65 other states constructed in @xcite correspond to some countable families @xmath65 3 .",
    "consider the case when @xmath66 a dimer covering of @xmath8 that means that for every vertex @xmath28 there exists exactly one bond @xmath67 such that @xmath68 the existence of dimer coverings is straightforward .",
    "+    + @xmath69 is a dimer covering of @xmath70 ( blue bonds ) .",
    "+ in the terminology of @xcite the ground state configurations @xmath71 and @xmath72 are called weakly periodic .",
    "according to our theorems they generate the corresponding low - temperature extremal states @xmath73 and @xmath74 . the qualitative difference between the states @xmath75 and the bg states @xmath9 is the following . the states @xmath9 describe the coexistence of the @xmath76 and @xmath2 states separated by an interface @xmath7 ; that means for example that for every @xmath77 one can find ( many ) points @xmath78 such that the phase in the ball @xmath79 looks as a small perturbation of the @xmath1 or @xmath2 state .",
    "namely , any point @xmath80 with @xmath81 would go .",
    "on the other hand , the typical configuration of the state @xmath73 or @xmath74 around any point @xmath80 has certain fractions of @xmath1 and @xmath82 spins .",
    "4 .   let @xmath83 be the free energy of the gibbs state of our ising model at inverse temperature @xmath84 corresponding to the boundary conditions @xmath85 unlike the classical case of the @xmath86 lattices , the free energy of the ising model on @xmath0 might depend on the boundary conditions . clearly , for every @xmath87@xmath88 moreover,@xmath89 for @xmath87 large enough .",
    "we conjecture that the states @xmath73 and @xmath74 have the highest possible free energy among all the gibbs states at a given temperature on the tree @xmath0 with @xmath90 .",
    "a more elaborate example is the ` secondary dimer covering ' , corresponding to a dimer covering @xmath69 . by this",
    "we mean any collection of bonds @xmath91 such that * every bond @xmath92 is incident to exactly two bonds @xmath93 from @xmath69 ; * every bond @xmath94 is incident to exactly one bond @xmath95from @xmath96 . +    + again , for low temperatures we have @xmath97 6 .",
    "yet another example can be obtained by considering the family @xmath98 corresponding to the following monomer - dimer covering . by this",
    "we mean ( see fig .",
    "3 ) the collection of bonds @xmath18 such that * for every @xmath99 the distance @xmath100 * for every @xmath28 the distance @xmath101 +    7 .",
    "a final example is the family @xmath102 corresponding to the ` path covering ' of the tree @xmath8 namely , the family @xmath103 is defined by the property that every @xmath28 belongs to precisely two bonds from @xmath104 thus the bonds from @xmath103 split into double infinite non - intersecting paths , passing through each vertex of @xmath8 to apply our results we need in this case @xmath105 +    + as the reader can easily see , many more regular , as well as infinitely more irregular examples can be constructed in the manner above .",
    "next , we formulate our conjecture about the decomposition of the low temperature free state @xmath10 into extremal states . we think that this decomposition should be into our measures @xmath48 and @xmath49 with various sets @xmath33 which are sparse enough ( depending on the temperature ) .",
    "the proof of theorem [ lowt ] is based on contour representation of the model .",
    "the remaining theorems follow from it .    consider a configuration @xmath38 that coincides with a ground state configuration @xmath106 outside finite box @xmath107",
    "a site @xmath80 is called incorrect , iff @xmath108 .",
    "the set @xmath109 of incorrect sites then decomposes into maximal connected components , @xmath110 .",
    "( here a set of sites is called connected if for any two sites @xmath111 there exist a sequence @xmath112 for which @xmath113 and @xmath114 are n.n . for all @xmath115 . )      a contour @xmath118 of the configuration @xmath38 is the subgraph defined by the set of vertices @xmath119 and all bonds of @xmath120 between them .",
    "the interior @xmath121 of @xmath118 is the set @xmath122      obviously , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the configurations and the sets of all its contours , provided the boundary condition @xmath106 is given .",
    "every collection of contours thus constructed is called a compatible collection .",
    "this allows to write the partition function in a finite ball @xmath127 of radius @xmath128 as follows : @xmath129\\}=\\sum_{\\{\\gamma_{1},\\ldots,\\gamma_{n}\\}_{c}}\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\varrho ( \\gamma_{i})\\ ] ] with @xmath130\\}$ ] . here",
    "the first sum is over all configurations that coincide with the configuration @xmath106 outside the ball @xmath127 , the second sum runs over all compatible families of contours with vertex set in @xmath127 , and @xmath131 denotes the configuration that contains only one contour @xmath132 .",
