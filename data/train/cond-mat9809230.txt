    "the fact that two parts of a polymer chain can not occupy the same place at the same time due to their finite volume has been recognised in the polymer literature for many years now as being an extremely important microscopic phenomenon that governs the macroscopic behavior of polymer solutions  @xcite . like hydrodynamic interaction ,",
    "the _ excluded volume _",
    "effect influences the properties of polymer solutions even in the limit of extremely long chains because it is responsible for segments remote from each other along the polymer chain interacting with each other .",
    "while the effect of excluded volume on static properties of polymer solutions has been widely studied , there have been very few attempts at examining its influence on properties far from equilibrium .",
    "excluded volume effects can be incorporated into bead - spring chain models for polymer solutions in a relatively straightforward manner by adding the excluded volume interaction force between a particular bead and all the other beads in the chain ( pairwise ) to the other potential forces that are acting on the bead .",
    "an noteworthy aspect of this approach is the kind of repulsive potential that is adopted to represent the excluded volume interactions . in static theories of polymer solutions ,",
    "the excluded volume interaction is typically assumed to be a very short range @xmath2-function potential .",
    "fixman  @xcite and more recently ahn  et al .",
    "@xcite have attempted to predict the rheological properties of dilute polymer solutions by approximately incorporating the effects of both hydrodynamic interaction and excluded volume in a self - consistent manner into a bead - spring chain model .",
    "( ahn  et al",
    ".  also include finitely extensible springs in place of hookean springs ) . in order to obtain a solvable model ,",
    "fixman  @xcite used a repulsive quadratic excluded volume potential in place of a @xmath2-function potential .",
    "this leads to a tractable model since the bead - connector vectors are then described by a gaussian non - equilibrium distribution function .",
    "results obtained with the quadratic excluded volume potential have , however , not been compared so far with the results of other models for the excluded volume potential .",
    "andrews  et al .",
    "@xcite have recently carried out a numerical study of the influence of excluded volume interactions on rheological and rheooptical properties of dilute solutions , with the help of brownian dynamics and configuration biased monte carlo simulations .",
    "a bead - spring chain model , with `` fraenkel '' springs between beads and a morse potential to represent excluded volume interactions , was used to to model the flexible polymer molecule .",
    "attention was largely confined to the prediction of properties in elongational flow and transient shear flow .",
    "the predictions of their theories in the limit of long chains have not been considered by fixman  @xcite , ahn  et al .",
    "@xcite and andrews  et al .  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the universal character of excluded volume effects have been studied using renormalisation group theory methods based on kinetic theory models ( with a @xmath2-function excluded volume potential ) by ttinger and coworkers  @xcite .    while the work of andrews  et al .",
    "@xcite is based on brownian dynamics simulations , the accuracy of the other _ approximate _ treatments of excluded volume cited above has not been tested by comparison with brownian dynamics simulations ( which are an ideal tool for testing approximations for nonlinear effects ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation that exists for kinetic theory models that only incorporate hydrodynamic interaction effects , where extensive comparisons between the exact results of brownian dynamics simulations and various approximations have been made  @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to examine the influence of the excluded volume effect on the rheological properties of a dilute polymer solution by using a _ narrow gaussian potential _ to describe the excluded volume interactions .",
    "since the narrow gaussian potential tends to the @xmath2-function potential in the limit of a parameter @xmath0 ( that describes the width of the potential ) going to zero , it provides a means of evaluating results obtained with a singular @xmath2-function potential .",
    "compared to the @xmath2-function potential , analytical calculations are not significantly harder with the narrow gaussian potential ; quite often , upon setting @xmath3 at the end of a calculation , the predictions of a @xmath2-function potential can be obtained .",
    "furthermore , since brownian dynamics simulations can not be performed with a @xmath2-function potential , simulations carried out with the narrow gaussian potential for small values of the parameter @xmath0 provide a means of asymptotically obtaining the predictions of a @xmath2-function potential model .",
    "any molecular theory that seeks to describe the dynamics of polymers in good solvents must simultaneously incorporate both the microscopic phenomena of hydrodynamic interaction and excluded volume , since hydrodynamic interaction effects have been shown to have an unavoidable influence on the dynamic behavior of polymer solutions",
    ". however , it would be difficult to explore the consequences of such a theory for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the incorporation of hydrodynamic interaction would lead to the complication of multiplicative noise . secondly , since brownian dynamics simulations for long chains would be extremely computationally intensive , any approximations that are developed can only be tested for very short chains . for these reasons , and being in the nature of a preliminary investigation , we examine excluded volume effects independently from hydrodynamic interaction effects , and confine attention here to a hookean dumbbell model for the polymer .",
    "this enables the careful evaluation of various approximations .",
    "it is hoped that , in the future , the best approximation can be used for chains with both hydrodynamic interaction and excluded volume , with the ultimate objective of calculating universal properties predicted in the long chain limit .",
    "it must be noted that unlike in the case of the quadratic potential , the use of the narrow gaussian potential does not lead to exact solvability .",
    "indeed , as has been observed in earlier treatments of other non - linear microscopic phenomenon such as hydrodynamic interaction and internal viscosity , it is found that it is not possible to obtain an analytical solution valid at all shear rates . as a result",
    ", retarded motion expansions , brownian dynamics simulations , and perturbative and non - perturbative approximation procedures are used in this work to obtain the material functions predicted by the narrow gaussian potential .",
    "an important consequence of using the narrow gaussian potential is that the nature of fixman s quadratic excluded volume potential can be explored .",
    "predictions of fixman s quadratic excluded volume potential in simple shear flow will be compared with the predictions of the narrow gaussian potential .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  2 , the basic equations required to discuss the dynamics of hookean dumbbells in good solvents are derived . in section  3 , the various material functions considered in this paper are defined . a retarded motion expansion for the stress tensor , for arbitrary excluded volume potentials , is derived in section  4 , and power series expansions for the material functions in simple shear flow are obtained .",
    "section  5 is devoted to examining the consequences of describing the excluded volume interaction with a narrow gaussian potential . in section  5.1 ,",
    "expressions for the material functions predicted with this potential at zero shear rate are obtained by using the retarded motion expansion .",
    "the formulation of a brownian dynamics simulation algorithm is discussed in section  5.2 , and a gaussian approximation for the configurational distribution function is introduced in section  5.3 . in section  5.4 ,",
    "a first order perturbation expansion in the strength of the excluded volume interaction is derived .",
    "fixman s theory for dumbbells is presented in section  6 , in terms of the framework adopted for the rest of the discussion in this paper .",

    "this paper examines the consequence of introducing an excluded volume interaction between the beads of the dumbbell , so that the total potential experienced by the beads , @xmath10 , is the sum of the spring potential @xmath11 , and the excluded volume potential @xmath12 .",
    "the force on bead @xmath13 due to this potential , @xmath14 , is then given by @xmath15 . for hookean springs ,",
    "the spring potential is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the spring constant .",
    "two forms of the excluded volume potential are considered in this work , namely , the narrow gaussian potential , and fixman s quadratic potential .",

    "a retarded motion expansion for the stress tensor , derived previously for the fene dumbbell model  @xcite , can be adapted to the present instance by recognising that the fene spring potential ( as indeed any choice of excluded volume potential ) is but a particular example of a connector force potential between the beads of the dumbbell . in this section ,",

    "it is possible to explicitly obtain the particular solution of a similar second order differential equation .",
    "it is clear from equation  ( [ giesekus ] ) that at steady state , the stress tensor can be found once @xmath98 is known .",
    "the second moment @xmath98 can be found correct to second order in velocity gradients by using the power series expansion  ( [ flowdistexp ] ) for @xmath80 , and the specific forms for @xmath87 and @xmath89 in equations  ( [ phi1 ] ) and ( [ phi2 ] ) , respectively .",

    "the most succesful approach so far towards approximately evaluating these moments has been to develop a perturbation expansion in the parameter @xmath1 , and to use renormalisation group methods to refine the results of the perturbation calculation  @xcite .",
    "an alternative and simpler non - perturbative route is the uniform expansion model  @xcite .",
    "the use of the narrow gaussian potential  albeit in the simple context of hookean dumbbells  provides an opportunity to compare the results of these approximate models with the exact solution .",

    "higher order perturbation expansions are obtained by _ dropping _ divergent terms , as they are postulated not to matter .",
    "these divergent terms arise from products of the @xmath2-potential for the _ same _ pair of interacting beads . in dumbbells , these are the only kind of beads present . as a result , there is no meaningful or mathematically consistent way of going beyond first order perturbation theory for dumbells in the limit @xmath107 .    note that both the series , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , are alternating series . furthermore ,",
    "for given values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the terms decrease monotonically for large enough values of @xmath40 .",
    "it follows then , from the leibnitz criterion for alternating series  @xcite , that both @xmath144 and @xmath145 converge for all values of @xmath1 and @xmath139 .",
    "this suggests that , even though it is not possible to switch the integral and summation in equation  ( [ sjexp ] ) for @xmath148 , the value of @xmath117 at @xmath148 can be found by setting it equal to the limit of @xmath149 as @xmath107 .",

    "two different brownian dynamics simulation algorithms have been adopted here for the numerical solution of equation  ( [ ito ] ) .",

    "the first scheme obtains steady - state expectations by the simulation of a single long trajectory , and is based on the assumption of ergodicity  @xcite .",
    "it has been used to obtain results at equilibrium , and for large values of the shear rate .",
    "a second algorithm  which employs a variance reduction procedure  has been used at low values of the shear rate , since the variance for the viscometric functions is found to be relatively large at these shear rates .",
    "reduction in the variance is obtained by following a scheme suggested by wagner and ttinger  @xcite . the scheme  which constructs an ensemble of trajectories over several relaxation times , from start - up of flow to steady - state  essentially consists of subtracting the rheological properties obtained from a parallel equilibrium simulation .",
    "while this does nt change the average values of the properties , it significantly reduces the fluctuations , since the fluctuations are virtually the same at zero and small shear rates .",

    "since we are only concerned with excluded volume in the context of hookean dumbbells in this work , we shall only consider those approximations which are relevant in this context .",
    "the introduction of the quadratic potential , the governing equations of fixman s theory , and the calculation of material functions predicted by the theory in simple shear flow are considered in this section .      with regard to excluded volume , the most crucial approximation of fixman  @xcite is the replacement of the delta function potential with a quadratic potential . by adopting a boson operator formulation of the governing equations",

    "it turns out that @xmath229 , in the presence of a quadratic excluded volume potential and with consistently averaged hydrodynamic interaction  @xcite , is a gaussian distribution .",
    "evaluation of the average for a @xmath2potential  ( [ delpot ] ) , with a gaussian distribution  ( [ gausdist ] ) , leads to the following non - dimensional quadratic potential , @xmath230 it is straightforward to show that the potential  ( [ modquadpot ] ) leads to an unphysical _ non - central _ excluded volume force between the beads .",
    "fixman , perhaps for this reason , introduces a further approximation which consists of replacing the above potential with the following simpler form , @xmath231 where , @xmath173 is defined as before by equation  ( [ alpha ] ) . however , in this case , @xmath173 obeys the consistency relation , @xmath232 interestingly enough , equation  ( [ equirel ] ) reduces to equation  ( [ fixalp ] ) in the limit @xmath107 ( which corresponds to a @xmath2potential ) .",
    "it is appropriate here to note that while fixman has presented all his arguments for bead - spring chain models , the form of fixman s potential for dumbbells given above can be found in the book by larson  @xcite .",
    "the consequences of adopting the quadratic excluded volume potential  ( [ quadpot ] ) are briefly discussed in the following section .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out here that fixman s original formulation of the problem was not in terms of the gaussian distributions and second moments discussed below .",
    "rather , his attempt was to directly solve the diffusion equation  ( [ diff ] ) for the configurational distribution function , and then carry out the average in equation  ( [ kram ] ) to obtain the rheological properties .",

    "indeed , it can be shown that the linear viscoelastic properties are given by equations  ( [ etaprime ] ) and  ( [ lvetap0 ] ) , where the quantities @xmath190 and @xmath236 are now given by , @xmath237    in steady simple shear flow , substituting equation  ( [ momscompsf ] ) for @xmath169 and equation  ( [ ssf1 ] ) for @xmath59 , into the second moment equation  ( [ fixsecmom ] ) , leads to the following equations for the components of @xmath169 , @xmath238 where , @xmath239 must satisfy the nonlinear algebraic equation , @xmath240    the normalised viscometric functions can be found by using the definitions  ( [ sfvis ] ) , and the results above for the zero shear rate properties , @xmath241    the nonlinear algebraic equation  ( [ sfs2 ] ) is solved here with a newton - raphson scheme .",

    "the predictions of rheological properties in simple shear flow , by the various theories for the excluded volume effect , are compared in this section .",

    "the continuous curves are exact predictions obtained by numerical quadrature , while the triangles and circles are exact results of brownian dynamics simulations carried out at equilibrium ( without variance reduction ) [ see equation  ( [ etap02 ] ) ] .",

    "the parameter @xmath0 does not enter into fixman s theory , however , these values are plotted corresponding to @xmath3 , since the quadratic potential is used in fixman s theory as an approximation for the @xmath2-potential .",
    "the first feature to be noticed in figure  [ fig1 ] is the reassuring closeness of the exact results obtained by using the retarded motion expansion and by brownian dynamics simulations .",
    "the retarded motion expansion provides a means of validating the results of brownian dynamics simulations .    in the limit @xmath107 , and for large values of @xmath0 ,",
    "the continuous curves and brownian dynamics simulations reveal that , as expected , the exact predictions of the narrow gaussian potential tend to the @xmath1-independent @xmath49-solvent value , @xmath246 .",
    "this implies , as pointed out earlier , that the use of a @xmath2-function potential to represent excluded volume interactions does not lead to any change in the zero shear rate viscosity prediction .",
    "on the other hand , figure  [ fig1 ] seems to suggest that a finite range of excluded volume interaction is required to cause a change from the @xmath49-solvent value .",
    "away from these limits , at non - zero values of @xmath0 , the narrow gaussian potential predicts an increase in the value of zero shear rate viscosity .",
    "the existence of shear thinning in good solvents can be attributed to this increase .",
    "this follows from the fact that at high shear rates , as the effect of the excluded volume interaction diminishes , the viscosity is expected to return to its @xmath49-solvent value .",
    "we shall see later that this expectation is indeed justified .",
    "the dashed lines in figure  [ fig1 ] indicate that in the limit of zero shear rate , for a given value of @xmath1 , the gaussian approximation is reasonably accurate above a certain value of @xmath0 .",
    "this limiting value of @xmath0 appears to be smaller for smaller values of @xmath1 .",
    "a similar behavior is also observed with regard to the prediction of the zero shear rate first normal stress difference ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "thus it appears that the exact configurational distribution function @xmath41 becomes increasingly non - gaussian as the narrow gaussian potential becomes narrower , and as the strength of the excluded volume interaction becomes larger .",
    "for the large values of @xmath1 considered in figure  [ fig1 ] , results obtained with the first order perturbation expansion in @xmath1 can not be expected to be accurate .",
    "it is clear from the dot - dashed lines that the perturbation expansion results deviate significantly from exact results for small values of @xmath0 .",
    "however , they become increasingly accurate as @xmath0 increases , for a given value of @xmath1 . this can be understood by considering equation  ( [ etaper ] ) , which indicates that in the limit @xmath247 , the first order correction to the @xmath49-solvent value increases as @xmath1 increases , but decreases as @xmath0 increases .",
    "as @xmath0 increases from zero , values of the zero shear rate viscosity predicted by the gaussian approximation , approach the exact values more rapidly than the predictions of the first order perturbation theory , for a given value of @xmath1 .",
    "the gaussian approximation is a non - perturbative approximation ",
    "however , it was shown in section  5.4 , to be exact to first order in @xmath1 .",
    "one way to understand this is to consider the gaussian approximation to consist of an infinite number of higher order terms , whose nature is unknown . in this sense",
    ", it is an _ uncontrolled _ approximation , which remains accurate at values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , where the first order perturbation expansion becomes inaccurate . as will be seen",
    "shortly , these remarks apply also to the results obtained at finite shear rate .",
    "the difference in the prediction of the zero shear rate viscosity by fixman s theory and by the narrow gaussian potential is evident in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is also worth noting that , although the relaxation weight and the relaxation time are different in fixman s theory and in the gaussian approximation for @xmath3 , they lead to the same prediction of the zero shear rate viscosity .",
    "this is , however , not true for the zero shear rate first normal stress difference .",
    "the ratio @xmath248 , defined by  @xcite , @xmath249 is equal , in the zero shear rate limit , to @xmath250 in the gaussian approximation , while it has a constant value of 2 in fixman s theory .    both the uniform expansion model and the gaussian approximation use gaussian distributions in order to evaluate averages .",
    "however , the uniform expansion model uses different gaussian distributions for different equilibrium averages , such that the best approximation is obtained .",
    "while this does not lead to any difference in the prediction of the zero shear rate viscosity by the two approximations , figure  [ fig2 ] reveals that , at small enough values of @xmath0 , there is a significant difference in the prediction of the zero shear rate first normal stress difference .",
    "clearly , the uniform expansion model continues to be a reasonable approximation for values of @xmath0 at which the gaussian approximation is no longer accurate .",
    "however , even the uniform expansion model leads to a poor approximation at sufficiently small values of @xmath0 .    in the discussion of the equilibrium perturbation expansion in section  5.1.2 ,",
    "it was pointed out that , in principle , the equilibrium moment @xmath117 can be obtained for any non - zero value of @xmath0 , provided that enough numbers of terms in the series for the quantities @xmath144 and @xmath145 , are summed [ see equations  ( [ s0s1 ] ) ] .",
    "figure  3 displays the sum @xmath144 , for different numbers of summed terms in the perturbation expansion , as a function of @xmath0 , for @xmath251 .",
    "exact results are obtained by noting that @xmath252 , and evaluating @xmath253 by numerical quadrature .",
    "clearly , more terms of the expansion are required for convergence as @xmath0 decreases .",
    "the terms of the series , which are alternating in sign , keep increasing rapidly in magnitude , until @xmath40 is approximately @xmath254 , before they begin to decrease .",
    "therefore , as @xmath1 increases , or as @xmath0 decreases , more and more terms are required for the sum to converge .",
    "above a threshold value of @xmath255 however , it becomes impossible to evaluate @xmath144 since the round - off errors due to the summation of large numbers makes the perturbation expansion numerically useless .",
    "a similar problem is also encountered while evaluating the sum @xmath145 . in short ,",
    "the hope of extrapolating finite @xmath0 results to the limit @xmath3 , can not be realised . therefore ,",
    "in the case of hookean dumbbells , one can not obtain equilibrium moments for a delta function excluded volume potential by using a narrow gaussian potential and considering a perturbation expansion in the limit @xmath107 .",
    "the results of brownian dynamics simulations ( without variance reduction ) displayed in figure  [ fig4 ] reveal that the dependence of the viscosity and the first normal stress difference on @xmath0 , at a value of the non - dimensional shear rate @xmath256 , is similar in shape to the dependence observed in the limit of zero shear rate . at small and large values of @xmath0",
    "the material functions tend to the @xmath49-solvent value , and exhibit a maximum at some value in between . since , even at this non - zero value of shear rate , it appears that the viscosity and the first normal stress difference remain at their @xmath49-solvent values for @xmath141 , it implies that the use of a @xmath2-potential to represent excluded volume interactions would not predict any shear thinning . on the other hand , as we shall see subsequently , a quadratic potential does predict substantial shear thinning . at @xmath256 ,",
    "the gaussian approximation seems to be accurate above roughly the same values of @xmath0 as were observed in the limit of zero shear rate .",

    "the prediction of shear thinning for non - zero values of @xmath0 is apparent , and our earlier expectation in this direction is justified . in particular , the predictions of brownian dynamics simulations , the gaussian approximation , and the first order perturbation theory tend to @xmath49-solvent values at high shear rates .",
    "shear thinning , which is seemingly physically meaningful , is also predicted , as can be seen from figure  [ fig5 ] , by both the gaussian approximation and the first order perturbation theory , for @xmath3 .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath2-function excluded volume potential , and is clearly an artifact of the perturbation expansion , since rigorous calculations indicate a trivial result .",
    "it remains to be seen if the situation is different in the limit of long chains .    for small enough values of @xmath1 , and large enough values of @xmath0 ,",
    "the results of the gaussian approximation , and the first order perturbation expansion , agree exceedingly well with the exact results of brownian dynamics simulations .",
    "indeed , as @xmath220 increases for fixed values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , both the gaussian approximation , and the first order perturbation expansion become increasingly accurate . in particular ,",
    "if both the approximations are accurate at zero shear rate , they continue to remain accurate at non - zero shear rates .",
    "this can be understood in the case of the first order perturbation expansion by considering equations  ( [ etaper ] ) and  ( [ psi1per ] ) .",
    "clearly , the departure from the @xmath49-solvent values decreases as @xmath220 increases .",
    "this is inline with the intuitive expectation of decreasing excluded volume interactions with increasing shear rate .    for a fixed value of the shear rate @xmath220 , as @xmath1 increases , or @xmath0 decreases , the predictions of the gaussian approximation and the first order perturbation expansion become increasingly inaccurate , with the first order perturbation expansion breaking down before the gaussian approximation",
    "this can be expected , since the gaussian approximation  being exact to first order in @xmath1is at least as accurate as the first order perturbation expansion .",
    "the two different brownian dynamics simulation algorithms mentioned in section  5.2 were used to obtain the data in figures  [ fig5 ] and  [ fig6 ] .",
    "while the algorithm with variance reduction was used for shear rates upto @xmath259 , the algorithm without variance reduction was used at higher shear rates . with regard to the results obtained by variance reduction",
    ", it was found that the variance was typically reduced by a factor of five to ten by the parallel equilibrium simulation subtraction procedure . while the magnitude of the reduced variance was relatively independent of shear rate for the viscosity , it decreased with increasing shear rate for the first normal stress difference .",
    "the time to reach steady - state , from start - up of flow , was roughly ten relaxation times for @xmath260 , @xmath243 and @xmath261 , and roughly fifteen relaxation times for @xmath244 .",
    "rheological properties in the two parallel simulations remained correlated during the time required to reach steady - state , and as a result the present technique proved adequate for the purpose of variance reduction .",
    "we have seen earlier  in figure  [ fig1]that both fixman s theory , and the gaussian approximation for @xmath3 , lead to identical values for the zero shear rate viscosity .",
    "this coincidence is , however , restricted to the limit of zero shear rate . at non - zero shear rates , as can be seen from figure  [ fig7 ] , there is considerable divergence between the predictions of the two theories .",
    "fixman s theory for dumbbells , though differing considerably from the narrow gaussian potential in terms of its predictions of rheological properties , has the appealing aspect that it captures some of the _ universal _ features of the behavior of good solvents  which can only be expected from bead - spring chain theories in the limit of a large number of beads .",
    "we have seen this universal behavior earlier in the correct prediction of the end - to - end distance scaling , and in the parameter free nature of the ratio @xmath248 .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] displays the prediction by fixman s theory of the reduced variable @xmath262 versus the non - dimensional shear rate @xmath263 where , @xmath264 , is a characteristic relaxation time . here , @xmath265 is the zero shear rate intrinsic viscosity , @xmath140 is the molecular weight and @xmath266 is avagadro s number . for dilute solutions one can show that , @xmath267 .",
    "the figure clearly reveals that as @xmath268 , the curves for different values of @xmath1 overlap .",

    "shows that equation  ( [ anal ] ) is accurate over a fairly wide range of @xmath274 .    the universal behavior discussed above is not exhibited by the gaussian approximation .",

    ", the normalised material functions do not collapse onto a single curve when plotted versus @xmath274 .",
    "it is , however , not realistic to expect a dumbbell model to exhibit universal features , and the real verification of universal behavior requires the development of a theory for long bead - spring chains .",
    "the non - dimensional ratio @xmath248 [ see equation  ( [ upsieta ] ) ] has a constant value of two , independent of shear rate , for hookean dumbbells in @xmath49-solvents , and in fixman s theory for good solvents .",
    "figure  9 displays the predictions of @xmath248 by the narrow gaussian potential , obtained by brownian dynamics simulations , the gaussian approximation , and the following first order perturbation expansion ( which can be derived from equations  ( [ etaper ] ) and  ( [ psi1per ] ) ) , @xmath276 where , @xmath277 has been defined below equation  ( [ psi1per ] ) . since",
    "a logarithmic scale has been chosen for the shear rate axis , it is difficult to represent the zero shear rate value of @xmath248 . however , since it is very nearly constant at low values of shear rate , the zero shear rate value is represented in figure  9 by the filled circles on the @xmath278-axis .",
    "all the data in figure  9 have the same trend of remaining nearly constant at low shear rates , and approaching asymptotically the value of two at high shear rates . in the case of the first order perturbation expansion ,",
    "this can be understood by considering equation  ( [ upsietaper ] ) in the limit @xmath279 .",
    "the dependence of the mean squared end - to - end distance @xmath280 on @xmath220 is revealed in figure  10 .",

    "interestingly , the effect of excluded volume interactions on swelling increases with increasing shear rate . in the case of the first order perturbation expansion  which appears to be accurate for @xmath243 , but not for @xmath261this can be understood by noting , in the expression above , that the term representing the correction to the theta solvent result due to the presence of excluded volume increases as the shear rate increases .",
    "the use of a narrow gaussian potential , to describe the excluded volume interactions between the beads of a hookean dumbbell model , leads to the prediction of swelling and shear thinning for relatively small non - zero values of the extent of interaction @xmath0 .",
    "this is essentially caused by an increase in the magnitude of the equilibrium moments relative to their @xmath49-solvent values .",
    "a delta function description of the excluded volume potential , on the other hand , is found to predict neither swelling nor shear thinning for hookean dumbbells .    for a given strength of the excluded volume interaction @xmath1 , the gaussian approximation is found to be reasonably accurate for values of @xmath0 larger than some threshold value .",
    "the behavior of the gaussian approximation can be understood by comparing its predictions with those of a first order perturbation expansion in @xmath1 , since it is shown here to be exact to first order in @xmath1 .",
    "the perturbation expansion reveals that the departure of the viscometric functions from their @xmath49-solvent values increases with increasing @xmath1 , but decreases with increasing @xmath0 , and increasing shear rate @xmath220 .",
    "the use of a quadratic potential in fixman s theory leads to the prediction of viscometric functions which are considerably different from those of the narrow gaussian potential .",
