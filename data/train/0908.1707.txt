    "heat conductivity is a central problem in thermodynamics .",
    "it is well known that the classical description in irreversible thermodynamics , essentially fourier s law , has unattractive features . in particular",
    ", it predicts an instantaneous propagation of thermal signals .",
    "this is in contradiction to the expected hyperbolic nature of physical laws .",
    "in fact , the associated non - causality would be completely unacceptable within a relativistic theory . resolving this issue",
    "has been a main motivating factor behind the development of extended irreversible thermodynamics @xcite , a model which introduces additional dynamical fields in order to retain hyperbolicity and causality .",
    "this model has proved useful in various application areas , ranging from superfluid systems to heat conduction in solids .    in this paper",
    "we consider the problem of heat conductivity within the flux - conservative multi - fluid framework developed by @xcite ( with the corrections discussed by @xcite ) .",
    "this model builds on the non - dissipative variational model developed by @xcite , and represents the natural non - relativistic counterpart to carter s convective variational hydrodynamics in general relativity @xcite , see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "these models have so far primarily been used to investigate the dynamics of compact stars ( see @xcite for details ) . yet , one would expect the general framework to be relevant .",
    "it is therefore of some interest to consider applications in other problem areas .",
    "this serves several purposes .",
    "first of all , it is often the case that the elegant geometric view of a relativistic analysis ( where time and space are treated `` equally '' ) simplifies the description of a complex system .",
    "the close link between the variational multi - fluid model and the relativistic counterpart may lead to insights that would be hard to reach otherwise .",
    "secondly , it is interesting to learn from the requirements of models for a range of different systems .",
    "ultimately , this will improve our understanding of the general multi - fluid framework , and the role of the various parameters in the model .",
    "in this paper we focus on the simplest `` conducting '' system , with a single species of particle together with a massless entropy component .",
    "if the entropy drifts relative to the particles , the system is heat conducting . throughout the discussion",
    "we will assume that the entropy can be treated as a ( massless ) fluid .",
    "in essence , this means that the `` phonon mean free path '' is not too large .",
    "we aim to demonstrate that our flux - conservative formulation for this system captures key aspects of extended thermodynamics .",
    "we illustrate this by writing down a model for heat conductivity in a rigid solid and comparing to various results in the literature .",
    "this exercise makes it clear that our model incorporates a finite propagation speed for heat .",
    "we also learn that the associated relaxation timescale is directly linked to the entrainment between particles and entropy .",
    "this entropy entrainment also played a central role in our recent discussion of finite temperature superfluids @xcite .",
    "in fact , the model we consider here is formally equivalent to our recent model for superfluid helium , the key element being that the massless entropy component is allowed to flow relative to the particles in the system .",
    "however , the discussion here differs in that we do not impose the irrotationality constraint associated with a superfluid system .",
    "instead , we focus on the heat conductivity .",
    "we wish to understand to what extent this , conceptually rather elegant , model captures the complex physics associated with heat flow . as an interesting by - product ,",
    "the present discussion suggests how the helium model could be extended ( using a three - fluid model ) to account for the thermal conductivity associated with the interaction between rotons and phonons that dominates at higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "this is an interesting problem since the development of a causal model for this phenomenon is still outstanding .",
    "our analysis also hints at the key ingredients of a causal relativistic model for heat conductivity .",
    "the main lesson is that the entropy entrainment must be retained in order to avoid pathological behaviour .",
    "we consider a simple system with two dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "we distinguish between the mass carrying `` atoms '' and the massless `` entropy '' .",
    "the former will be identified by constituent index @xmath0 , it has mass @xmath1 , number density @xmath2 and flows with a velocity @xmath3 , while the latter is represented by @xmath4 , with number density @xmath5 ( the entropy per unit volume ) and a flow given by @xmath6 . the canonical momentum ( density ) for each fluid",
    "is determined by the variational analysis of @xcite .",
    "this leads to _ i^= mn v_i^- 2 w_i^  , for the atoms and ^_i = 2 w_i^  , [ smom]for the entropy .",
    "this latter relation encodes the inertia of heat .",
    "we see that the heat s inertia vanishes if the entrainment between the two components , quantified by @xmath7 , vanishes . in these expressions",
    "we have used the relative velocity @xmath8 .",

    "so far , the development has been formal .",
    "the model was developed by combining the non - dissipative equations of motion from the variational analysis @xcite with the general form for the dissipative terms assuming a quadratic deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "we have accounted for the onsager symmetry between the dissipative terms , and imposed the conservation of total angular momentum .",
    "this reduces the problem to one with nine , as yet unspecified , dissipation coefficients ; @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it should be noted that a number of , essentially , analogous formulations for multi - component systems exist in the literature , see for example @xcite .",
    "however , most of these are not arrived at by variational arguments , and hence they do not distinguish the fluxes from the canonically conjugate momenta .",
    "this means that the entrainment effect tends to be ignored .",
    "in fact , the novelty of our approach relates to the entrainment between particles and entropy . from an intuitive point of view , this encodes the inertia of heat and allows us to assign an effective mass to the entropy component .",
    "it is well known that these concepts are central to causal models of heat conductivity , and we will soon see why this is so .",
    "it is natural to begin the discussion of heat conductivity by sketching the classic approach to the problem .",
    "this provides a useful contrast to the more general model that we will develop .",
    "the following argument is more or less identical to that provided by @xcite .",
    "first we rewrite as _",
    "t s + _ i [ s v_^i + s w_^i ] = _  . in general , @xmath40 if the system is out of equilibrium .",

    "j w_^i  , [ tgs ] we arrive at _ = - 1 t f_i^w_^i = 2 t ^ w_^2 = 2^ ( q s t ) ^2 0  .",
    "the second law of thermodynamics thus requires that @xmath42 . in the following",
    "we will often omit the subscripts on the resistivity coefficient @xmath31 .",
    "this makes the equations somewhat clearer and we do not believe that it should cause any confusion .    finally , if we consider the case of vanishing entrainment ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) then it follows from that f_i^= s _",
    "i t = - f_i^= 2 w_i^ = - 2 st q_i  , or q_i = - 1 2 s^2 t _",
    "i t  . comparing to fourier s law",
    "we identify the thermal conductivity as = 1 2 s^2 t  .",
    "this completes the traditional description of the heat conductivity problem .",
    "however , for reasons that we have already discussed , this analysis is not entirely satisfactory .",
    "fortunately , the multi - fluid approach advocated here allows for a more general view .",
    "this alternative description has a richer phenomenology and recovers a number of features of extended irreversible thermodynamics @xcite . illustrating this is one of the main purposes of our discussion",
    "the analysis in the previous section focussed on the entropy conservation law .",
    "the spirit of the discussion was very much that of classic irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "we will now depart from this view , and ask what we can learn by taking the two - fluid model , e.g. the entropy inertia , at face value .",
    "the massless entropy flow and the associated entrainment then play central roles .",
    "let us consider the entropy momentum equation ( [ eulers ] ) a bit closer .",
    "we can rewrite this equation as @xmath43 for simplicity , we first include only the resistive contribution to the dissipation , i.e. , we set d^_ij = 0  , f^_i = 2 w_i^  , as before .",
    "then we have @xmath44 where we recall the definition of the entropy momentum , .",
    "it turns out to be instructive to view this equation in the context of extended irreversible thermodynamics @xcite . to facilitate the comparison ,",
    "let us focus on the simplified case of heat conduction in a rigid solid .",

    "it also leads to the presence of a second sound in solids , an effect that has been observed in laboratory experiments on dielectric crystals , see for example the discussion by @xcite .",
    "as described by @xcite , the cattaneo equation provided key stimulus for the development of extended irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "the above exercise shows that the variational multi - fluid formalism contains a key element of extended thermodynamics .",

    "[ gibbs1]meanwhile , one of the tenets of extended irreversible thermodynamics is the generalised entropy s(u , q)=s_0(u)- 1 2 ( t ) q^2  , where @xmath55 is the internal energy . as discussed by @xcite ,",

    "the entropy satisfies the generalised gibbs identity ds = 1 t du - dq^2  .",
    "[ gibbs2]it is now apparent that , once we identify @xmath56 , and contain similar information .",
    "the key point is that the energy / entropy of the system depends on the heat flux .",
    "this is natural since the heat flux corresponds to the flow of energy relative to the matter current .",
    "the variational approach provides a slightly different perspective on the problem , but the predicted dynamics should be equivalent .    before moving on ,",
    "it is worth discussing the role of the non - linear terms that were discarded in .",
    "the variational analysis naturally leads to the presence of quadratic terms in the heat flux . due to their origin , i.e. the entropy momentum equation , these terms ( essentially ) take the same form as the non - linear terms in the standard euler equation . in other words , they do not represent the most general non - linearities that one might envisage ( in the dissipative problem ) . in the interest of clarity ,",
    "we have chosen not to compare the non - linear terms in our model to various attempts at constructing non - linear heat - conducting models , see for example @xcite and @xcite .",
    "such a comparison would obviously be interesting given that non - linearities are relevant for the development of both shocks and turbulence . however , our main initial aim is to establish the viability of the multi - fluids approach to the heat problem . for this purpose ,",
    "the evidence provided by the linear comparison should be adequate .",
    "the model discussed in the previous section is the simplest in a hierarchy of possible heat conductivity models . by relaxing the assumptions that led to we",
    "can easily obtain more complicated models .",
    "such models are interesting , because may not provide a faithful representation of all relevant phenomena .",
    "it is obviously important to compare a more general model to analogous efforts in the literature .",
    "this comparison provides further insight into the usefulness of the multi - fluid framework and the interpretation of the various coefficients .",
    "so far we have neglected the viscous stresses in the entropy momentum equation .",
    "let us now relax this assumption , i.e. , account also for @xmath57 .",
    "in order to simplify the analysis somewhat , we will still assume that @xmath58 .",
    "that is , we ignore the coupling to vorticity .",
    "we now need d^_ij = d_ij - d^_ij = - g_ij [ ( - ^ ) _ + ( ^- ^ ) _ ] - 2 [ ( - ^ ) ^_ij + ( ^- ^ ) ^_ij ]  . rewriting this expression in terms of the particle velocity @xmath3 and the relative flow @xmath30 we have d^_ij = - g_ij ( - ^ ) _ - 2 ( - ^ ) ^_ij - g_ij | _ - 2 | ^_ij  , [ ds]where we have introduced | = 2 ^- ^ -  , | = 2 ^- ^ -  .",

    "this result can be directly compared to the `` phonon hydrodynamics '' model developed by @xcite ( see @xcite , and @xcite for alternative descriptions ) .",
    "their model is the most celebrated attempt to account for non - local heat conduction effects .",

    "the usefulness of this result is due to the fact that it can be used both in the collision dominated and the ballistic phonon regime . in the former ,",
    "the resistivity dominates , the nonlocal terms can be neglected and heat propagates as waves . in the opposite regime , the momentum conserving interactions are dominant and we can neglect the thermal relaxation . in this regime , heat propagates by diffusion .",
    "the transition between these two extremes has recently been discussed by @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the non - local heat conduction model may be useful in the description of nano - size systems .",
    "if a system has characteristic size @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , then one would not necessarily expect a fluid model to apply .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite have argued that the expected behaviour of the thermal conductivity as the size of the system decreases ( as discussed by @xcite one would expect the `` effective '' conductivity to scale as @xmath66 ) can be reproduced from provided that the appropriate slip condition for @xmath46 is applied at the boundaries . a key part of this analysis is the close analogy between and the navier - stokes equation . in the latter case",
    "it is well - known that an applied non - slip condition at a surface leads to the formation of a viscous boundary layer that dominates the dissipation of the bulk flow .",
    "it appears that the heat problem is quite similar in the ballistic phonon regime , although the required slip condition is different .",
    "this is an interesting problem that requires more detailed study .",
    "at this point we have demonstrated that the multi - fluid formalism , with one fluid representing the massless entropy , reproduces a number of non - trivial results for heat conductivity in rigid solids .",
    "however , this is a simplified problem since one of the degrees of freedom in the system was `` frozen '' . in order to complete the model",
    ", we will now relax this assumption and allow @xmath67 .",
    "this leads to a system of equations with interesting applications .",
    "in particular , one could imagine modelling systems with spatial transitions to superfluidity ( as in a neutron star core ) . in one regime , the system would be dominated by resistivity , while the thermal relaxation timescale determines the dynamics elsewhere . a unified model for this problem could prove very useful indeed .",
    "let us return to the general two - fluid model and focus on the matter degree of freedom .",
    "as in the case of superfluid helium @xcite , it is natural to work with the total momentum equation . by combining and",

    "we now have a `` complete '' model for a heat conducting fluid .",
    "it combines the equations of motion ( [ mom1 ] ) and ( [ mom2 ] ) with the two continuity equations ( [ conn ] ) and ( [ cons ] ) .",
    "this model should be relevant for dynamics on timescales such that the thermal relaxation can not be ignored . in a typical system",

    "finally , there may be situations where the model applies even if the thermal relaxation can be safely ignored",
    ". this would be the case when the `` phonon '' mean free path exceeds the size of the system .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the dissipative terms in then play the leading role and the crucial boundary effects may be incorporated by imposing suitable surface conditions on the heat flux .",

    "this discussion may provide useful insight into the modelling of both nano - systems and superfluids at low temperatures where the phonon mean - free path is large compared to the size of the system .",
    "finally , we formulated a `` complete '' heat conducting two - fluid model and identified a number of `` new '' dissipative terms .",
    "future work needs to establish whether there are physical situations where these terms play a decisive role .    what is the importance of this work ?",
    "first of all , we believe that the discussion provides strong support for the main assumptions of our model : that one can treat the entropy as an additional fluid , endowed with the inertial and dynamical properties generally associated with fluids .",
    "the entrainment between particles and the massless entropy plays a key role in this approach .",
    "the connection between this entropy entrainment and the thermal relaxation time provides an immediate interpretation , and illustrates the importance , of the main parameter of the model .",
    "the simple fact that the mathematical framework can be used to model both heat conduction and finite temperature superfluids @xcite is , in our view , clear evidence of the elegance and promise of the variational multi - fluid approach . moreover , since our model has its origin in a fully relativistic variational analysis , see @xcite for a review , the present discussion suggests a promising strategy for developing a causal relativistic model for heat conductivity .",
