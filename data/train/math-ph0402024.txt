    "it has been known for some time that the classical boltzmann equation admits global unique solutions in all space if either the initial data are small enough in suitable norms , or , equivalently , the mean free path is large enough .",
    "the first result of this type appeared in @xcite , where the analysis was restricted to the hard sphere case .",
    "hamdache @xcite generalized the method to cut - off hard potential interactions , and bellomo and toscani found a variation of the method which allowed inclusion of less rapidly decreasing initial values @xcite .",
    "the method and the key references may be found in research monographs such as @xcite or in the survey article by ukai @xcite .",
    "the regularity of these solutions has more recently been explored in work by mischler and perthame @xcite , boudin and desvillettes @xcite .    the key property which made these global existence and",
    "uniqueness results possible is the hidden convolution structure present in the gain part of the collision term ; this structure was first observed , and exploited in the discrete velocity setting in one dimension by tartar @xcite .",
    "casual analysis of the quoted literature shows that the method does actually barely use the decomposition of the boltzmann collision operator into a gain and a loss part ; in fact , the results remain true for gain - term - only boltzmann equations , i.e. , equations where the loss part is simply deleted from the collision term .",
    "however , no such global result has been proved for the relativistic boltzmann equation . here",
    "the collision geometry is more involved ( see the end of this section ) and the available methods of proof in the classical case depend crucially on the collision geometry , eg .",
    "the method of illner and shinbrot relies on the identity ( 3.5 ) in @xcite , which is a consequence of the galilean invariance of the classical collision geometry .",
    "( see also the discussion in section 2.5 of @xcite ) .",
    "we remark that it has been known for a long time that in each case where the gain - term - only boltzmann equation can be solved uniquely on some time interval , then the full boltzmann equation can be solved , uniquely , on the same time interval for the same initial value . a good method to prove",
    "this is the kaniel - shinbrot iteration scheme ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the methods in @xcite and the other mentioned references really first focus on gain - term only equations . once these are solved , it is then a rather mechanical matter to include the loss terms .",
    "the methods will certainly not work for spatially homogeneous gain - term - only boltzmann equations , because ( unless one considers zero data ) the spatial homogeneity implies that the total amount of gas present is infinite .",
    "one of the results we present below is a simple argument which shows that we will in general have blowup for the homogeneous case in finite time even if velocity space is artificially truncated to a bounded domain .    here",
    ", we demonstrate the limits of the method by showing that deletion of the loss term will in general mean loss of global solvability for all relevant space - dependent versions of the boltzmann equation , including the relativistic case .",
    "such a result was proved in @xcite for classical hard spheres , but , as recently observed by one of the authors ( h. a. ) , the proof given there is flawed .",
    "specifically , the method in @xcite uses integration of suitably chosen subsets of velocity space to obtain lower bounds for solutions .",
    "near the bottom of page 256 of the reference , a set @xmath0 is defined to complete a certain estimate .",
    "a careful geometric analysis shows that this set is always empty , and the argument collapses at this point .",
    "r. illner , co - author of the reference , regrets this error , but is pleased to present a better method in this paper .",
    "the key steps presented in section [ classical ] below depend mostly on the collision geometry , which is quite simple in the classical cases : post- ( or pre- ) collisional velocities lie opposite on a sphere with center @xmath1 and diameter @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the velocities of the collision pair under consideration . for relativistic interactions the collision geometry is different from the classical one , due to the fact that the collison invariants have a different form . the collision geometry for classical interactions",
    "is spherical and invariant under translations ( galilean invariant ) , i.e. , the collision sphere is unchanged as long as the relative velocity remains the same .",
    "this is not the case in the relativistic situation where the collision geometry is lorentz invariant ; instead of spheres we get ellipsoids and the excentricity of an ellipsoid changes with the energies of the particles involved in the collision process .",
    "the collision geometry is central in lemma 1 below but the properties of the collision geometry needed in the proof are easily verified in both cases .",
    "we are concerned with the equation @xmath5 with initial condition @xmath6 here , @xmath7 denotes time , @xmath8 is an integrable nonnegative initial value , and @xmath9 denotes the gain part of the usual collision term for the boltzmann equation , in standard notation ( the local dependence on @xmath10 and @xmath11 in ( [ gain ] ) is omitted ) . pre- and post- collisional velocities satisfy the conservation of momentum , @xmath12 , and of energy , @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the collision kernel which depends on the type of interparticle potential . for details ,",
    "see @xcite . in the hard sphere case , considered in @xcite , @xmath15 for this case",
    "it is shown there that the initial value problem has a local unique solution ; the point is that this solution will in general blow up in finite time .",
    "our present objective is to provide a correct and more general proof for this fact .",
    "the proof will work for all kernels @xmath14 satisfying the condition that if @xmath16 is a set of positive measure , then @xmath17 this assumption is used in the proof of lemma [ char ] below and does not seem to exclude anything physically reasonable .",
    "we will further work under the assumption that the initial value problem is uniquely solvable locally in time , a fact which can be proved for reasonable collision kernels along the lines of the proof in @xcite .",
    "as in @xcite we restrict our analysis to initial values @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are characteristic functions of the balls @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are positive constants to be chosen later .    before we can deal with the full problem , we focus on the spatially homogeneous case with a truncation in velocity space .",
    "the reason for the truncation will become transparent later .    a key ingredient in our argument is the following estimate for the action of the gain term on characteristics functions .    [ char ] let @xmath23 and assume that @xmath14 satisfies ( [ assumption ] ) . then there are constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 such that @xmath26    _ proof : _ this estimate is a consequence of the collision geometry , see figure [ fig1 ] below ( one dimension is suppressed )",
    ". choosing @xmath3 in or just outside the ball @xmath27 , we can construct collision spheres such that both the centre of the sphere and the antipode @xmath4 of @xmath3 are both in @xmath27 , and the post - collisional velocities @xmath28 are also in @xmath27 for a set of collision parameters @xmath29 of positive measure on @xmath30 .",
    "the constant @xmath31 is a positive lower bound of @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the positive measure set of @xmath34 and @xmath29 for which the above conditions hold .",
    "it is clear that @xmath35 has a positive lower bound unless @xmath36 is chosen too large or unless @xmath14 vanishes on sets of positive measure , which is prohibited by the assumption ( [ assumption ] ) .",
    "@xmath37    the proof of the next lemma is immediate , but we formulate the result for easy reference .",
    "let @xmath38 be integrable density functions for which @xmath39 is defined .",

    "@xmath37    we return now to the spatially inhomogeneous case .",
    "the rest of our argument is identical to what was done on @xcite , but we repeat the analysis here for the convenience of the reader .",
    "first , recall that we are concerned with @xmath73 with initial values @xmath74 it is known @xcite that the initial value problem has a unique nonnegative mild local solution under reasonable assumptions on the collision kernel @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , if we consider the modified problem @xmath75 then this problem is also uniquely solvable in the mild sense , and @xmath76 while the larger of the two exists . to show blowup",
    "it is therefore enough to show that @xmath77 will blow up in finite time , and to this end we will reduce the problem to the spatially homogeneous case resolved in the previous section .",
    "we need    choose @xmath78 arbitrary but fixed , and suppose that @xmath79 then , if @xmath80 is in the interval of existence of @xmath81 , and if @xmath82 then @xmath83 for all @xmath84    _ proof : _ this proof is identical to the one in @xcite .",
    "first , note that the local solution of the initial value problem is obtained as the limit as @xmath85 of the iteratively defined functions @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 we also note that @xmath89 , and by construction @xmath90 for all @xmath91 and all @xmath92 the claim of the lemma is trivial for @xmath93 and assuming that it holds for some @xmath94 it follows from ( [ iterate ] ) that it also holds for @xmath95 : in fact , if one of @xmath96 or @xmath97 is larger than @xmath98 the integrand in ( [ iterate ] ) vanishes .",
    "if @xmath99 and @xmath100 we have in addition that @xmath101 the inductive hypothesis then entails that @xmath102 for both @xmath103 whenever @xmath104 it follows that for all such @xmath105 , all @xmath3 and all @xmath106 $ ] that @xmath107    @xmath37    the next theorem is our main result .",
    "[ blowup2 ] let @xmath69 be the local mild solution of ( [ be ] ) with the initial value @xmath74 if @xmath108 or @xmath109 are sufficiently large this solution will blow up in finite time , in both the @xmath110 or the @xmath111 norm .",
    "_ proof : _ if we consider a fixed time interval @xmath112 $ ] and a fixed @xmath113 let @xmath114 then the previous lemma implies that @xmath77 is independent of @xmath11 in the set @xmath115 , so on this set the evolution of @xmath77 is effectively given as the solution of the initial value problem @xmath116 we know from our earlier discussion of the truncated spatially homogeneous case that the solution of this initial value problem will blow up in @xmath112 $ ] if @xmath108 is large enough ; alternatively , if @xmath108 is positive but small , we can make @xmath109 large enough such that the condition @xmath117 will hold for the required blowup time @xmath118 .",
    "the assertion of the theorem follows .",
    "this section contains a discussion on the generalization of theorem [ blowup2 ] to the relativistic boltzmann equation .",
    "we start with a short introduction to the problem , see @xcite for more details .",
    "the speed of light and the rest mass of particles are both normalized to unity , i.e. , @xmath119 ; the convention on the signature is @xmath120 .",
    "we denote by @xmath121 the one - particle distribution function , with @xmath122 denoting the momentum variable .",
    "the relativistic boltzmann equation has the form @xmath123 where the collision operator is defined by @xmath124 here @xmath125 is the element of surface area on @xmath126 , @xmath127 is the four momentum ( @xmath128 ) , and @xmath129 is the particle energy .",
    "conservation of momentum and energy now read @xmath130 the total energy and the relative momentum in the center of mass system are @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively .",
    "the scattering angle @xmath133 in the center of mass system satisfies @xmath134 the kernel @xmath135 and the scattering cross section @xmath136 are related by @xmath137 the case of a constant scattering cross section corresponds to the relativistic hard sphere model . for maxwellian molecules one has @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is an arbitrary function of the scattering angle .",
    "we also mention a different representation of the relativistic collision operator which is closer in form to the classical one , see appendix ii in @xcite for a derivation .",
    "we can write @xmath140\\,{\\rm d}\\omega{\\rm d}p\\ ] ] where @xmath141 and @xmath142 @xmath143 here @xmath144 is the total energy and @xmath145 . as shown in figure [ fig2 ] below , for fixed @xmath146 and as @xmath147 varies on @xmath30 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 lie on an ellipsoid ( one dimension is suppressed ) .",
    "the excentricity of the ellipsoid is given by @xmath150 in particular it is bounded for bounded pre - collisional momenta .    finally , the collision operator can in an obvious way be written as @xmath151 where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are referred to as the gain and loss term respectively .",
    "hence , the gain - term - only relativistic boltzamnn equation reads , @xmath154    local existence and uniqueness of mild solutions to the cauchy problem for the relativistic boltzmann equation has been shown in @xcite , where the more general case of a background curved metric is considered . for initial data close to equilibrium global existence has been obtained in various function spaces @xcite . at present a similar result for data near vacuum ,",
    "i.e. , for small data , is not available as was briefly discussed in the introduction .    by inspection of the proof of theorem 1",
    "it follows that an identical result also holds for the gain - term - only relativistic boltzmann equation ( [ rb2 ] ) .",
    "the essential properties of the collision geometry needed in the proof of lemma 1 are easily verified also in this case .",
    "the relevant picture in the relativistic case is given by figure [ fig2 ] below .",
    "the remaining details of the proof of blowup for the only - gain - term relativistic boltzmann equation are very similar to the classical case and are omitted .",
    "note however , that since finite propagation speed is already present in the relativistic situation , velocity truncation is not longer necessary in this case .",
