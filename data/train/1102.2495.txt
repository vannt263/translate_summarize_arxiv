    "a phase diagram provides intrinsic knowledge on the structure of the matter under study . in other words , it tells us how matter organizes itself under external conditions at a given degrees of freedom .",

    "going towards the smaller @xmath10 region , the point in the qcd phase plane ( @xmath0 vs. @xmath10 ) where the first order phase transition ends is the qcd critical point ( cp )  @xcite .",
    "the focus in the coming decade would be on attempts to locate the cp both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "current theoretical calculations are highly uncertain about the location of the cp .",
    "this is primarily because the lattice qcd calculations at finite @xmath10 face numerical challenges .",

    "production by this process is not suppressed as per the ozi ( okubo - zweig - izuka ) rule  @xcite .",
    "this , coupled with large abundances of strange quarks in the plasma , may lead to a dramatic increase in the production of @xmath18 mesons and other strange hadrons relative to non - qgp @xmath15+@xmath15 collisions .    , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 normalized to average number of participating nucleons ( @xmath21 ) in nucleus - nucleus collisions to corresponding yields in inelastic @xmath15+@xmath15 collisions as a function of @xmath21 at 200 gev .",

    "figure is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    such predictions of relative enhancement of strange hadron was challenged by an alternate idea of canonical suppression of strangeness in small systems being the source of strangeness enhancement in @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 hadrons in high energy heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the strangeness conservation laws require the production of an @xmath17-quark for each @xmath16-quark in the strong interactions .",
    "the main argument in such canonical models is that the energy and space time extensions in smaller systems may not be sufficiently large .",
    "this leads to a suppression of open - strange hadron production in small collision systems .",
    "these statistical models fit the data reasonably well  @xcite .",
    "these models predict two things : ( a ) strangeness enhancement in nucleus - nucleus collisions , relative to @xmath15+@xmath15 collisions , should increase with the valence strange quark content of the hadrons and ( b ) the enhancement is predicted to decrease with increasing beam energy  @xcite .",
    "discriminating between the two scenarios , qgp versus the canonical suppression , using the experimental data on @xmath25 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 hadrons has been , to some extent , ambiguous .",
    "enhancement of @xmath26 production ( zero net - strangeness , hence not subjected to the canonical suppression ) in heavy - ion collisions relative to @xmath15+@xmath15 collisions would clearly indicate the formation of a gluon rich qgp in these collisions .",
    "this would then rule out canonical suppression scenario .",
    "figure  [ phi ] shows the enhancement of strange hadron production at rhic  @xcite .",
    "upper panel shows the ratio of strange hadron production normalized to @xmath21 in nucleus - nucleus collisions relative to corresponding results from @xmath15+@xmath15 collisions at 200 gev .",
    "the results are plotted as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are found to exhibit an enhancement ( value @xmath28 1 ) that increases with the number of strange valence quarks .",
    "furthermore , the observed enhancement in these open - strange hadrons increases with collision centrality , reaching a maximum for the most central collisions .",
    "however , the enhancement of @xmath18 meson production shows a deviation from the ordering in terms of the number of strange constituent quarks .",
    "more explicitly , this enhancement is larger than for @xmath27 and @xmath19 , at the same time being smaller than in case of @xmath20 . despite being different particle types ( meson - baryon ) and having different masses ,",
    "the results for @xmath27 and @xmath19 are very similar in the entire centrality region studied .",
    "this rules out a baryon - meson effect as being the reason for the deviation of @xmath18 mesons from the number of strange quark ordering seen in fig .",
    "[ phi ] ( upper panel ) .",
    "the observed deviation is also not a mass effect as the enhancement in @xmath18 meson production is larger than that in @xmath19 ( which has mass close to that of the @xmath18 ) .",
    "further in heavy - ion collisions , the production of @xmath18 mesons is not canonically suppressed due to its @xmath16@xmath17 structure .",
    "the observed enhancement of @xmath18 meson production then is a clear indication for the formation of a dense partonic medium being responsible for the strangeness enhancement in au+au collisions at 200 gev . the observed enhancement in @xmath18 meson production being related to medium density is further supported by the energy dependence shown in the lower panel of fig .  [ phi ] .",
    "the @xmath18 meson production relative to @xmath15+@xmath15 collisions is larger at higher beam energy , a trend opposite to that predicted in canonical models for other strange hadrons .",
    "in addition measurements have shown that @xmath18 meson production is not from the coalescence of @xmath29 and is minimally affected by re - scattering effects in the medium  @xcite . measurements also indicate that @xmath18 mesons are formed from the coalescence of seemingly thermalized strange quarks  @xcite .",
    "all these observations put together indicate the formation of a dense partonic medium in heavy - ion collisions where strange quark production is enhanced .",
    "this in turn suggests that the observed centrality dependence of the enhancement for other strange hadrons ( seen in fig .",
    "[ phi ] ) is likely to be related to the same reasons as in the case of the @xmath18 meson , that it is due to the formation of a dense gluon rich partonic medium in the collisions .",
    "these experimental data rule out the possibility of canonical suppression being the only source of the observed strangeness enhancement at @xmath30= 200 gev .",
    "one of the most exciting results to date at rhic is the discovery of suppression in the production of high transverse momentum ( @xmath31 ) mesons in nucleus - nucleus collisions compared to corresponding data from the binary collision scaled p+p collisions  @xcite .",
    "this has been interpreted in terms of energy loss of partons in qgp .",
    "this phenomena is called as the jet quenching in a dense partonic matter  @xcite .",
    "the energy loss by energetic partons traversing the dense medium formed in high - energy heavy - ion collisions is predicted to be proportional to both the initial gluon density  @xcite and the lifetime of the dense matter  @xcite .",
    "the results on high-@xmath31 suppression are usually presented in terms of the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath32 ) , defined as :    @xmath33    where the overlap integral @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the number of binary collisions commonly estimated from glauber model calculation  @xcite .    ) for mesons and direct photons as measured in rhic experiments at midrapidity for central au+au collisions at @xmath36 = 200 gev .",

    "the lines are results from various model calculations .",
    "see text for more details . ]    in fig .",
    "[ raa ] we show the rhic data for the @xmath38 , for various produced mesons  @xcite and direct photons  @xcite in central au+au collisions at midrapidity . a large suppression in high @xmath39 meson production is observed , and those for @xmath40 s being almost flat at @xmath41 up to 20 gev/@xmath42 .",
    "the figure also shows that the level of suppression for @xmath40 s , @xmath43 s and @xmath18-mesons are very similar , which supports the conclusion that the suppression occurs in the partonic phase , not in the hadronic phase .",
    "this strong suppression of meson production is in contrast to the behavior of direct photons , also shown in the figure .",
    "the direct photons follow binary scaling ( i.e. @xmath44 ) or no suppression .",
    "this is a strong evidence that the suppression is not an initial state effect , but a final state effect caused by the high density medium with color charges created in the collision .",
    "this is further consolidated by a demonstration through a controlled experiment using deuteron on au ion collisions , which gave a @xmath45 @xmath3 1 for @xmath46 at midrapidity and high @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "the various curves in the fig .",
    "[ raa ] represents different model calculations .",
    "the dashed curve shows a theoretical prediction using the glv parton energy loss model @xcite .",
    "the model assumes an initial parton density @xmath47 , which corresponds to an energy density of approximately 5 - 15 gev/@xmath48 .",
    "the lower dashed curves are for higher gluon density .",
    "the precision high @xmath39 data at rhic has been used to characterize medium density fairly accurately .",
    "the conclusion being that the medium formed in central au+au collisions at rhic has a high degree of opacity  @xcite .",
    "in addition , theoretical studies suggest that for a given initial density , the @xmath32(@xmath39 ) values are also sensitive to the lifetime ( @xmath49 ) of dense matter formed in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the solid curves are predictions from ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath36 = 200 gev with @xmath49 = 10 fm/@xmath42 ( i.e. larger than the typical system size of @xmath3 6 - 7 fm ) .",
    "the parton energy loss calculations discussed above attributes the opacity to plasma induced radiation of gluons , much like ordinary bremsstrahlung of photons by electrons .",
    "however , the quantitatively large suppression pattern observed at high @xmath39 , for both light hadrons and those involving heavy quarks  @xcite , showed that the mechanism of energy loss is far from being a settled issue , namely , the relative contribution of radiative and collisional forms . as an example , shown in fig .",
    "[ raa ] is a comparison of the data to theoretical results ( dot - dash curves ) on @xmath32 from models that consider only collisional energy loss  @xcite .",
    "this model gives @xmath32 values at high @xmath39 close to the measured values and similar to corresponding values from models having only a radiative mechanism for parton energy loss .",
    "leading particle measurements , such as the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ raa ] suffer from a number of limitations .",
    "( a ) leading hadrons come from a mixture of parent quarks and gluons .",
    "( b ) as a fragmentation product , the energy of a leading hadron is not a perfect proxy for the energy of the parent parton as it samples a wide range of partonic energies .",
    "in future we should look forward to potentially three interesting measurements .",
    "( i ) the @xmath50-jet process potentially provides access to the underlying scattered parton s energy .",
    "measurements of the distribution of particles from the jet opposite , in azimuth , to the tagged photon reveals how much energy was lost , and how it was redistributed , by the colored parton as it traversed the medium  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) another method is through the full reconstruction of jets in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite . beyond producing a far better proxy for the energy of the parent parton than a leading hadron",
    ", this technique allows one to trace the evolution of energy flow in directions both longitudinal and transverse to the direction of the parent parton .",
    "both these methods are under active pursual at rhic .",
    "( iii ) another important feature of jet quenching is provided by partonic identity . while it is difficult to disentangle light quarks from gluons , especially in a heavy - ion environment , charm and bottom can be easily tagged by the existence of a charmed or bottom hadron in the final state . due to their large masses",
    "the charm and bottom quarks are predominantly produced via hard scattering in the initial stage of the high - energy heavy - ion collision .",
    "the final state spectra can therefore serve as a sensitive tool to probe in - medium rescattering and interactions responsible for thermalization .",
    "this will also allow to study the non - abelian feature of qcd that results in the gluons losing more energy than quarks in the medium  @xcite .",
    "plans are in place to measure the cross - sections and transverse momentum spectra of hadrons with open and hidden heavy flavor at rhic with new detector upgrades .",
    "this will also provide useful data to understand the different mechanisms of energy loss : collisional versus radiative .",
    "elliptic flow , @xmath51 , is an observable which is thought to reflect the conditions from the early stage of the collisions @xcite . in non - central heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the initial spatial anisotropy of the overlap region of the colliding nuclei is transformed into an anisotropy in momentum space through interactions between the particles .",
    "as the system expands it becomes more spherical , thus the driving force quenches itself .",
    "therefore the elliptic flow is sensitive to the collision dynamics in the early stages .",
    "it is measured , by calculating @xmath52 , where @xmath18 is the azimuthal angle of the produced particles and @xmath14 is the azimuthal angle of the impact parameter , and angular brackets denote an average over many particles and events .     for ( a ) light quark hadrons and ( b ) strange quark hadrons .",

    "such a separation of baryons and mesons in the intermediate @xmath31 range has been also observed in measurements of the nuclear modification factor , @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "these results are consistent with calculations from quark recombination models  @xcite implying the de - confinement of the system prior to hadronisation .",

    "the multi - strange hadrons ( @xmath18 and @xmath24 ) have relatively low hadronic interaction cross sections and freeze - out early , hence are considered as the most promising probes of the early stages of the collision .",
    "all the above results indicates that a substantial amount of collectivity has been developed at the partonic stage of the heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in fact none of the available hadronic models are able to account for the observed magnitude of @xmath51 at @xmath36 = 200 gev .",
    "only models which have additional partonic interactions explain the @xmath58 values  @xcite .    when elliptic flow @xmath53 is plotted versus transverse kinetic energy ( @xmath59 ) , both divided by the number of constituent quarks , the @xmath53 for all identified hadrons as well as light nuclei below ( @xmath59 ) @xmath3 1 gev/@xmath60 falls on a universal curve  @xcite .",

    "this scaling behavior as shown in fig.4 further strengthens the evidence for formation of partonic matter during the au + au collision process at 200 gev .",

    "turn - off of the scaling at a given beam energy would indicate the hadronic side of the phase boundary .",
    "the @xmath53 measurements of light quark carrying hadrons , the nuclear modification factor and @xmath53 for heavy quark carrying hadrons and the differential @xmath39 correlations for charged hadrons have been used to extract information of a dimensionless ratio , shear viscosity to entropy ( @xmath54 ) , for the medium formed in heavy - ion collisions at rhic  @xcite .",

    "such a low value of @xmath54 ( within a factor 1 - 10 of the quantum limit ) indicates that the matter formed in heavy - ion collisions at rhic has low viscosity , hence is a strongly coupled system .",
    "the cp is a landmark point in the qcd phase diagram , observation of which will make the qcd phase diagram a reality .",
    "a close collaboration between the experiments and theory perhaps will lead to its discovery .",
    "the first step in this process is to establish an observable for cp which can be measured experimentally and can be related to qcd calculations . in this context , it is important to recall that for a static , infinite medium , the correlation length ( @xmath63 ) diverges at the cp .",
