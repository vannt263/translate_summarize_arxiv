    "the physics of strongly interacting electron systems has received considerable attention over the recent years , and it still bears many challenges , especially on the theoretical side . among the various methods and ideas which have been explored in this context , gauge theories seemed to offer a rather attractive approach @xcite-@xcite . their essence is to focuss on the presence of a non double occupancy constraint , which leads to a local @xmath8 symmetry if a slave boson representation is used @xcite-@xcite .",
    "although it is possible to derive these gauge theories from an expansion around a large @xmath7 mean field theory of the t - j model @xcite @xcite , they could also be regarded as promising candidates for an effective low - energy theory in order to describe for instance the anomalous normal state properties of high-@xmath9 superconductors .",
    "they seem to predict a phase diagram for the single band t - j model which qualitatively ressembles the experimental ones for copper - oxide superconductors @xcite .",
    "further more , they reconcile the existence of a large fermi surface corresponding to luttinger s theorem , as shown by photoemission experiments , and the anomalous transport properties , which are mostly governed by holes @xcite @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic properties have also been investigated , and a good agreement with high temperature expansions for the t - j model has been reached @xcite . however , this work has also pointed out that fluctuations of the gauge field are large , in the sense that the variance of the local statistical flux around a given plaquette is not small in units of @xmath10 , even down to low temperatures .",
    "this feature suggests that the presence of the lattice may not be inessential , since it induces a periodic action as a function of the time and space dependent flux per plaquette .",
    "as demonstrated by poliakov , this periodic nature of the gauge field has dramatic consequences on 2 + 1 dimensional electrodynamics since it allows for non trivial space time configurations of the gauge field ( monopoles ) , which induce charge confinement @xcite . it should be emphasized that in the context of the t - j model , the gauge field lagrangian density is not the usual @xmath11 term , but it is generated upon integrating out fermionic and bosonic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "a perturbative estimate of a single monopole action has also been derived in @xcite , and was found to diverge .",
    "however , it is clear that some globally neutral configurations ( i.e. with the same number of instantons and anti - instantons ) have a finite action , and the main question is whether the corresponding two - component plasma exhibits debye - screening or not . this viewpoint has been developed by nagaosa @xcite where he assumed a dissipative - type action for the gauge field , which may be relevant for the t - j model at small temperatures , since it requires a finite dc conductivity for the fermions .",
    "his main conclusion is that no major instanton effect is present in the t - j model range of parameter since the dissipative nature of the gauge field dynamics strongly inhibits quantum tunneling . in the present paper ,",
    "we address this question from a slightly different perspective , with emphasis on the possible zero temperature transitions .",
    "by contrast to the results of reference @xcite , we find that assuming a ioffe - larkin form for the monopole plasma action leads to a phase transition between a debye screening phase ( which corresponds to a confining force between spinons and antiholons ) , and a dipole phase ( leading to unconfined spinons and antiholons ) .",
    "the control parameters are the band filling of the underlying t - j model , and the number @xmath7 of fermion colors ( the physical case being @xmath12 ) . in rather good agreement with physical intuition",
    ", the dipole phase of the plasma is found at large @xmath7 and small doping . in this regime , spin - charge separation may then be a self - consistent hypothesis .",
    "we note however that this leads either to a renormalized fermi liquid or an anomalous liquid depending on whether bose condensation of holons occurs or not . in the other phase , the gauge field",
    "can not be treated perturbatively , and the corresponding mesons ( bound states of spinons and antiholons ) are physical electrons .",
    "by contrast , a transition to the dipole phase is obtained in reference @xcite in the presence of an infinitesimal dissipation .",
    "the main difficulty of the problem is the determination of the phase diagram of the monopole plasma which exhibits long range interactions ( in space and imaginary time ) .",
    "furthermore , unlike the case of the standard compact 2 + 1 electrodynamics , a strong anisotropy exists between space and time directions , reflecting the lack of lorentz invariance in the model .",
    "this reduced symmetry increases the difficulty of real space rg analysis since the functional form of the monopole interaction potential is not stable under a rg transformation .",
    "our approach has attempted to take advantage of the fact that the interaction is much stronger along the time direction , with a @xmath13 dependence .",
    "the corresponding one dimensional problem exhibits a phase transition between a debye - screening phase and a dipole phase .",
    "we argue and give some numerical indication that the unbinding of the monopole - antimonopole pairs along the time direction triggers a 2 + 1 dimensional unbinding , leading to a globally debye - screening phase .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ section2 ] defines the statistical problem of the monopole plasma .",
    "the next section focusses on the 0 + 1 dimensional problem along a time direction , giving strong arguments in favor of a phase transition .",
    "the extension to the 2 + 1 dimensional situation is then discussed , leading to a phase diagram as a function of @xmath7 and fermion filling , which is the main result of the paper .",
    "the conclusion is dedicated to a comparison with previous work and stresses open questions .",
    "as already stressed in the introduction , we shall assume a lagrangian of the form @xmath14 the fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively fermionic and bosonic , and they are defined on a two dimensional square lattice with continuous imaginary time .",
    "the hopping constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be derived from a large @xmath7 saddle point approximation of the one band t - j model @xcite @xcite .",
    "we shall from now on focus on the effective dynamics of the @xmath8 gauge field @xmath19 , assuming that fermions and bosons have been traced out .",
    "as shown in the references @xcite @xcite , the gauge field action to gaussian order is dominated by the fermion contribution at low doping , and with the assumptions that the holons have not condensed . keeping only the transverse part which is responsible of the non - fermi liquid behavior gives @xcite @xmath20 in this equation , @xmath21 for @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the gauge field variables @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a lattice vector and @xmath27 a lattice site are denoted in the continuum limit by @xmath28 , in order to define the two component field @xmath29 .",
    "the time component of @xmath30 is identified with @xmath31 .",
    "most of the time , we shall use the axial gauge @xmath32 .",
    "latin indices such as @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote spatial components , whereas greek indices correspond to arbitrary components .",
    "the quantities @xmath35 and @xmath36 are derived with the approximation of a circular fermi surface , and by taking the long wavelength , small frequency limit of the fermion current - current correlation function .",
    "the main drawback of this action is that the fundamental periodicity of the original action ( [ eq1 ] ) , namely its invariance under @xmath37 is lost .",
    "this periodicity allows for non - trivial space - time configurations of the field corresponding to tunneling events where the flux threading a given plaquette may change by integer multiples of @xmath10 .",
    "ioffe and larkin suggest to express ( [ eq2 ] ) in terms of gauge invariant field strength @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , and to replace the flux par plaquette @xmath40 by its value modulo @xmath10 .",
    "this algorithm sounds quite natural on physical grounds .",
    "however , ( [ eq2 ] ) has been derived perturbatively for ` flat ' configurations which satisfy faraday s law : @xmath41 , where @xmath42 after the field strength @xmath43 is taken modulo @xmath10 , it satisfies @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the integer charges located at @xmath46,@xmath47 .",
    "an ambiguity arises in extending the result ( [ eq2 ] ) to non trivial configurations .",
    "we may add to equation ( [ eq2 ] ) any quadratic form @xmath48 without changing the result on ` flat ' configurations , but the action for non trivial configurations will depend on the kernel @xmath49 . in ( [ eq3 ] ) , @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote the transverse part of the electric field , and the magnetic field respectively .",
    "we also note that the perturbative evaluation of the fermion loop generates only the function @xmath52 .",
    "physical intuition suggests that @xmath53 is identical to the static diamagnetic susceptibility in the @xmath54 limit .",
    "this determines the two functions @xmath55 and @xmath53 as given above , and with such a determination , ( [ eq2 ] ) becomes @xmath56 equation ( [ eq4 ] ) is then extended to non - trivial configurations thus lifting the ambiguity in the choice of the kernel @xmath49 .",
    "but if the procedure seems perfectly sound at low frequencies , the separation between the electric and magnetic parts is less obvious to access at higher frequencies . in the bulk of this paper , we assume that this procedure is valid .",
    "the action for a many monopole configuration with a topological charge @xmath57 is then given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the fourier transform of the charge density , namely @xmath60 where @xmath27 is a lattice site .",
    "more specifically , this gives @xmath61 in this formula , the global factor @xmath7 has been added .",
    "it is simply the number of fermion colors in the large @xmath7 approaches .",
    "rescaling energies and frequencies by setting @xmath62 , the model depends only on two dimensionaless parameters , @xmath7 and @xmath63 . assuming a circular fermi surface",
    ", the maximal value of @xmath63 corresponds to @xmath64 electron per site for a given color , which gives @xmath65 .    before going further",
    ", we should mention that equation ( [ eq5 ] ) is not the only candidate for the monopole plasma action .",
    "developing an analogy with josephson junction arrays , and emphasizing the dissipative nature of the gauge field , nagaosa has also considered the following action @xcite : @xmath66 for the dissipative part of the gauge field dynamics .",
    "as shown in reference @xcite , it is possible to map it into a statistical model in some regimes , but mostly a bidimensional model is obtained .",
    "the key variables are the winding number @xmath67 along the time direction : @xmath68 with @xmath69-\\pi,\\pi]$ ] and @xmath67 and integer .",
    "it seems that both approaches respect the @xmath10 periodicity and the quadratic expansion of the gauge field around @xmath70 . in the absence of a fully first principle derivation",
    ", we shall adopt equation ( [ eq5 ] ) as a working hypothesis , and hope to clarify this issue in a future work .",
    "going back to equation ( [ eq6 ] ) , it is important to stress that for any @xmath71 value , the @xmath72 integral diverges if @xmath73 is non vanishing .",
    "therefore , we shall impose a constraint on the allowed topological charge configurations , namely that @xmath74 for any @xmath71 . in real space , it means that @xmath75 for any plaquette located at @xmath27 .",
    "the partition function of the plasma is then @xmath76 in this equation , @xmath77 denote the space - time coordinates of the monopoles with topological charge @xmath78 .",
    "we set @xmath79 if @xmath80 and @xmath81 if @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath83 expresses the constraint and @xmath84 if for any @xmath27 we have @xmath85 the interaction potential @xmath86 is obtained by fourier transform of equation ( [ eq6 ] ) @xmath87 with @xmath88 ( we set @xmath89 ) .",
    "an important ingredient in ( [ eq7 ] ) is the imaginary time scale @xmath90 which is obtained by calculating the ratio of the two gaussian determinants in the presence and in the absence of an instanton .",
    "we have carried out this calculation for the broken parabola model of ioffe and larkin , which leads to @xmath91 the interested reader will find a derivation of this result in the appendix .",
    "we note that the integral is divergent at large frequencies",
    ". this may be another signal that we have not yet found a satisfactory derivation of this monopole plasma action .",
    "since this @xmath90 depends on the full non linear action of the gauge field , which is still unknown , we shall assume it equal to unity in the following discussion ( since we have used @xmath89 as energy unit ) .",
    "the following sections are now dedicated to an analysis of the classical statistical system given by equation ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "we deduce from the interaction ( [ eq8 ] ) that the interaction betwen two monopoles is @xmath92 we have shifted the interaction by an infinite constant so that the pair interaction between two monopoles is finite .",
    "the energy of a configuration of monopoles satisfying the neutrality condition @xmath93 is finite and does not depend on the regularization of the pair potential .    from now on ,",
    "we are interested in the quantum problem at zero temperature , so the system is infinite along the imaginary time direction .",
    "we shall now use @xmath94 to denote the inverse fictitious temperature of the monopole plasma , which should nt introduce confusion .",
    "the two parameters associated to ( [ eq1 ] ) are @xmath95 and the prefactor @xmath96 .",
    "the interaction ( [ eq1 ] ) decreases as the distance @xmath97 between two plaquettes increases . in order to have an idea of the interaction ranges",
    ", we calculate the interaction @xmath98 as a function of @xmath99 for different values of the interplaquette distance .",
    "we first rearrange the expression ( [ eq1 ] ) using the change of variables @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we obtain @xmath102 with @xmath103 we plotted on figure [ fig1 ] the interaction for different values of the interplaquette distance @xmath104 . in a first approximation",
    ", we take into account only the one - plaquette interaction along the time direction . in section [ bidim ] ,",
    "we renormalize the bidimensional problem with a cut - off for the distance between two plaquettes .",
    "the interactions of the one - plaquette problem are simply @xmath105 .",
    "we look for the phase diagram of the potential @xmath106 in one dimension as a function of the exponent @xmath107 .",
    "fortunately , some exact results concerning the phase diagram of one - dimensional systems with long - range interactions are available @xcite .",
    "the main result shows rigorously the existence of a finite temperature phase transition for the 1d ferromagnetic ising model if the coupling @xmath108 , with @xmath109 @xcite . to some extent",
    ", these results can be transposed to generalized coulomb gas models , by considering a representation of the ising model in terms of kink and antikink configurations .",
    "the potential energy for a single kink - antikink pair is then proportional to @xmath110 , @xmath26 and @xmath111 being the locations of the kink and antikink .",
    "the ising and corresponding coulomb gas problems are however not equivalent since the ising model generates only rather special configurations where kinks and antikinks alternate .",
    "we expect intuitively the unrestricted coulomb gas to be less ordered than the corresponding ising model . by ordered state , we mean the dipolar phase . as a result , an unrestricted generalized coulomb gas with @xmath112 is expected to have a high temperature debye - screening phase if @xmath3 .",
    "the fact that @xmath113 ( the 1d genuine coulomb potential ) is the borderline is confirmed by several exact investigations @xcite @xcite showing that this system is always in the dipolar phase at any temperature .",
    "our problem is a special case , with @xmath1 . we shall now attempt to estimate the transition temperature to the debye phase .",
    "it is then tempting to use a real space rg analysis along the lines of references @xcite-@xcite . for instance , the coulomb potential in any dimension @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) has been analyzed in reference @xcite . for @xmath116 ,",
    "the system is always in a debye screening phase , whereas for @xmath117 , there exists a finite temperature transition .",
    "we note that this simple rg analysis still predicts a non trivial fixed point for @xmath118 and @xmath113 , in discrepancy with the exact results of references @xcite and @xcite . but as @xmath114 is decreased from 2 to 1 , the unstable fixed point is found for higher values of the plasma fugacity , so that the dilute approximation leading to the rg equations is no longer valid . hopefully , @xmath1 is not too large , so the usual rg procedure is consistent .    in order to analyse the one plaquette problem",
    ", we wish to treat the more general problem of the generalized coulomb potential @xmath119 in one dimension .",
    "we show that if @xmath120 , the plasma has a debye phase .",
    "we call @xmath121 the partition function of the plasma with a minimal separation @xmath99 betwen the charges , which position is allowed to vary from @xmath122 to @xmath123 . for a neutral system of @xmath124 particles , this defines an integration domain denoted @xmath125 .",
    "we wish to perform one renormalization step , that is to express @xmath121 as a function of @xmath126 .",
    "to do so , we write @xmath121 under the form @xmath127 we have introduced a fugacity denoted by @xmath128 . in this equation",
    ", we have taken into account @xmath129 dipoles with their center of gravity located at @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) and with a size between @xmath99 and @xmath132 .",
    "@xmath133 is the boltzmann weight of the @xmath134 remaining isolated charges located at @xmath135 .",
    "@xmath136 is the electric field at @xmath137 , created by the @xmath134 isolated charges .",
    "more specifically , @xmath138 with @xmath139 and @xmath140 the @xmath129 dipoles are assumed to be independent .",
    "the integration over the dipole coordinates @xmath130 must take into account the position of the other charges located at @xmath135 .",
    "we expand the @xmath141 in ( [ eq2 ] ) up to second order in the electric field , and we write @xmath142 where we have used the notation @xmath143 and where the integration domain takes into account the presence of a hard core condition .",
    "we first need to determine the function @xmath144 .",

    "indeed , the @xmath149 charges create a dipolar field at large distances which decays as @xmath150 or faster .",
    "taking the square gives the upper bound on @xmath107 for long distance convergency .",

    "the scaling equations are now obtained and read @xmath157 and the interaction function is modified by @xmath158 , \\ ] ] where @xmath159 is the particle separation .",
    "these equations are obtained by imposing the normalization constraints @xmath160 and @xmath161 since the fundamental form of the interactions is preserved only for the coulomb potential ( @xmath113 ) , these prescriptions are meaningful mostly near @xmath113 . in the case",
    "@xmath113 , we recover kosterlitz s rg equations as derived in @xcite .",
    "we note that the second term in the r.h.s . of equation ( [ eq9 ] ) is not given in @xcite , but it does nt change the critical behavior .",
    "its meaning is a natural reduction of fugacity because of excluded volume effects . the structure of these equations , and in particular , the fact that @xmath162 and @xmath163 shows that the model keeps a finite temperature transition , and that the size of the debye screening phase increases as @xmath107 decreases . coming back to our problem ,",
    "@xmath107 is fixed to @xmath164 for the single plaquette problem .",
    "the interaction strength is larger if @xmath7 increases and if @xmath165 decreases , so if @xmath63 increases",
    ". the dipolar phase is then expected at large @xmath7 and large electron filling , in agreement with the physical intuition that spin - charge separation is more likely to occur in the vicinity of the mott insulator and in the large @xmath7 limit .",
    "this defines a critical fermi wave vector @xmath166 such that spin - charge separation occurs for @xmath167 .",
    "the aim of section [ bidim ] is to obtain quantitative results for the variation of @xmath166 with the number of colors @xmath7 .",
    "we now consider the 2 + 1 dimensional problem .",
    "the derivation of the rg equations is a straightforward generalization of what has already been done in the 0 + 1 dimensional case .",
    "the potential @xmath98 is given by equation ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in time , with a period @xmath168 .",
    "this regularization will also be used in the numerical calculations .",
    "small dipoles ( with a length between @xmath99 and @xmath169 ) can only be parallel to the temporal direction since we require the local neutrality condition @xmath170 , so that the cut - off @xmath99 is only introduced in the temporal direction .",
    "the function @xmath144 is given by @xmath171 in this expression , the summation over @xmath27 is a summation over the plaquettes which contain the small dipoles ( with a separation in the temporal direction between @xmath99 and @xmath169 ) .",
    "@xmath172 is the difference between the time coordinates of the monopole @xmath34 and the monopole @xmath71 . as in the expression ( [ eq10 ] ) , the integration over the time coordinate of the small dipole contains a hard core condition .",
    "we evaluated numerically the integrals in ( [ eq13 ] ) , and took into account only the potentials @xmath98 such as @xmath173 , with @xmath174 a lattice cut - off .",
    "the rg trajectories are plotted on figure ( [ fig5 ] ) for different values of the fermi wave vector .",
    "notice that some trajectories are free to cross each other since the potential depends on the initial conditions via @xmath165 .",
    "we can check the validity of the predictions of the 0 + 1 dimensional approach : if @xmath5 , the plasma is deconfined whereas it is confined if @xmath6 . for a one - color model , we find @xmath175 .",
    "however , the fermi wave vector is bounded above by @xmath176 since there is less than 1/2 electron of a given color per plaquette .",
    "we conclude that there exists a transition even for the one - color model .",
    "we now adress the question of the @xmath7 colors monopole model . the action is simply multiplied by @xmath7 , inducing a change in the initial conditions of the renormalization procedure .",
    "we plotted on figure [ fig6 ] the critical fermi wave vector @xmath4 as a function of the number of colors .",
    "we see that for @xmath12 , which is the case of physical interest , that a possibility of a non fermi liquid arises as the doping increases .",
    "to conclude , the main result of this investigation is the possibility of tuning the microscopic parameters of the model ( here the number of colors and the filling factor ) in such a way that confinement between spinons and antiholons arises or not , depending on these parameters . using a different approach ,",
    "it had been previously claimed that the ioffe - larkin type of plasma relevant to the t - j model is always in the dipolar phase , so that spinons and holons have a chance not to form a fermi liquid @xcite .",
    "it is true that our plasma action ( equation ( [ eq6 ] ) ) is obtained from the simplest fermion loop , without dressing the fermion green s function , and this may be the source of the difference between the results .",
    "we were guided here by the very strong anisotropy of the intermonopole potential , making it much stronger along the time direction , and requiring the neutrality constraint for each plaquette along the time direction .",
    "our intuition is that screening may only be more effective if the two spatial dimensions are added to the one plaquette problem , thus weakening the strength of the large distance inter - monopole interaction .",
    "we hope that these ideas may lead to a more rigourous approach , and possibly monte - carlo studies of this plasma . moreover , we have also presented arguments showing that a satisfactory microscopic derivation of the plasma action is still missing .",
    "one difficulty is connected to the ambiguity present while implementing the necessary periodicity requirement from a perturbative calculation which by essence assumes ` flat ' field configurations .",
    "a second one , and maybe related to the previous remark , is the diverging bare fugacity which results from the villain - type treatment developed in the appendix .",
    "b.d . would like to thank j. wheatley and d. khveshchenko for their stimulating participation in earlier attempts to address the question of collective effects in the monopole plasma , and s. sachdev for an interesting discussion .",
    "we start from the quadratic action in the transverse subspace @xmath177 in this expression , @xmath51 is a scalar field and @xmath50 is related to @xmath51 by the faraday equation @xmath178 suppose we consider an instanton located on a given plaquette @xmath179 at time @xmath90 .",
    "the idea is to replace @xmath180 by @xmath181 . minimizing over transverse configurations of @xmath51 leads to the instanton profile @xmath182 here",

    "the fugacity is obtained from considering quadratic fluctuations around the single - instanton solution and integrating them out .",
    "we have to single out the zero mode which corresponds to a global translation along the time direction of this solution .",
