    "in contrast to the galactic bulge , the inner 300 pc of the galaxy is experiencing ongoing star formation . this",
    "is dramatically displayed by the @xmath160 ultra - compact hii regions in the giant molecular cloud sgr b2 @xcite , and by three young , dense clusters of massive stars ( the arches , the quintuplet , and the central parsec ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the average star formation rate is estimated to be @xmath40.02 @xmath5   yr@xmath6 , or @xmath41% of the total galactic value @xcite .",
    "about half of the recent star formation can be accounted for by the three massive star clusters mentioned above , but this implies that the sites of formation for the other half of the young stars in the central 300 pc has not yet been identified .",
    "one possibility is that star clusters less massive than the arches and quintuplet ( @xmath4@xmath7 @xmath5 ) have already begun to dissipate , and are difficult to identify against the dense background of older stars near the galactic center @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a half - dozen relatively isolated hii regions near the galactic center have been associated with individual young , massive stars @xcite , which could suggest that stars can also be formed in small associations .",
    "our understanding of how stars form near the galactic center would be greatly helped by identifying more of the young stars expected to exist there .",
    "we have carried out a radio survey at 8.4 ghz with very large array ( vla ) of the region between 3  and 10  from the super - massive black hole , in order to identify counterparts to the @xmath82000 x - ray sources identified using the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite .",
    "the general properties of the radio sources detected in this survey will be described elsewhere . here , we report the properties of two radio and x - ray sources that also had counterparts among the @xmath818,000 stars in the same region from the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ;  2.1 ) .",
    "we identify one , , as a new emission - line star located 10 pc in projection from the galactic center .",
    "the second is a previously - identified luminous , young star associated with radio hii region h2 @xcite .",
    "we also present an assessment of whether x - ray and radio surveys could be generally effective for identifying luminous young stars (  2.2 ) .",
    "we find x - ray emission from two of five massive , emission - line stars that were previously identified through infrared spectroscopy of stars located near hii regions by @xcite ( h2 and a wn6 star associated with sgra - a ) , and provide updated positions for all five stars based on the 2mass catalog .",
    "we discuss the origin of the x - ray emission from the young stars in our sample , and the implications that the detection of the new young , massive star has for understanding the star formation history near the galactic center (  3 ) .",
    "we identified two young stars by comparing a catalog of discrete sources compiled from very large array ( vla ) observations at 8.4 ghz ( 3.6 cm ; g. c. bower , in prep ) to the _ chandra _  and the 2mass catalogs .",
    "the vla observations were taken in the b - array during 2002 august .",
    "they were sensitive to sources as faint as 250 @xmath9jy that were located between 5  and 10  of , although the sensitivity declined to @xmath83 mjy within a few arcminutes of  because of the bright diffuse radio emission there .",
    "the vla observations identified 30 unresolved sources , and 55 extended sources .",
    "the positions of the unresolved sources were accurate to 01 .",
    "we searched for x - ray counterparts using the catalog in @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in the positions of the x - ray sources in the _ chandra _  catalog are accurate to 03 at the aim point of the observation ( i.e. , ) , but within 510  from  the average uncertainty was @xmath41 . since most of the radio sources were found at larger offsets , we searched for x - ray and radio sources that were located within 1  in projection .",
    "we found two matches between the unresolved radio sources and the x - ray catalog within a radius of 1 . by adding random shifts to the relative alignments of the two catalogs",
    ", we determined that 1 of these matches was likely to be spurious . within the extents of the diffuse vla sources , we find 5 x - ray counterparts ,",
    "although three or four should be random associations .",
    "we then compared the locations of the 7 x - ray sources with the 2mass catalog , and found that 2 had infrared counterparts within 1of the x - ray sources : cxogc j174528.6285605 , which is coincident with a previously - identified young star in the bright ( @xmath8450 mjy at 8.4 ghz ) , extended radio nebula h2 @xcite , and the new source  ( hereafter referred to as ) , which is associated with a 2.3@xmath100.3 mjy unresolved radio source .",
    "the chance that one of these radio and x - ray sources randomly would have a 2mass counterpart within 1  is @xmath1115% ; if we restrict ourselves to 2mass sources with @xmath12@xmath1110 , the chance is @xmath114% .",

    "the presence of strong h and he emission lines indicates that both sources are hot , massive stars .",
    "the radio continuum and infrared line emission suggested that there could be significant amounts of warm gas and dust surrounding these young stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we searched for this in the mid - infrared , using version 2.3 of the midcourse space experiment ( msx ) point source catalog @xcite .  and h2 are the only two sources detected in the x - ray and 2mass catalogs that also has a counterpart within 15 in the msx catalog .",

    "therefore , in order to determine its origin , we determined the x - ray intensities , spectra , and light curves for each star using the acis_extract routine from the tools for x - ray analysis ( tara ) and ciao version 3.2 .",
    "the techniques are described in @xcite , and the dates and exposure times for the observations used are listed in @xcite . in brief , for each source we extracted source events from within the 90% contour of the point spread function ( psf ) , and background events using annular regions that excluded known point sources and discrete filamentary features .",

    "the mean fluxes of the sources did not change during the first 85% the exposure taken through 2003 june ( * ? ? ?",

    "the best - fit spectral parameters and derived luminosities for the two detected sources are listed in table  [ tab : spec ] , and the spectra are displayed in figure  [ fig : xspec ] .",
    "finally , massive stars , particularly those in binaries , are often variable x - ray sources . therefore",

    "the two most luminous x - ray sources ,  and h2 , are the brightest infrared sources in table  [ tab : prop ] .",
    "we compared their spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spex ] ) to those of the pistol star @xcite and to the atlases of @xcite and hanson , conti , & rieke ( 1996 ) .. our low - resolution spectra can not be used to classify stars with the detail achievable with high - resultion optical spectra .",
    "however , the line emission from br-@xmath0 , he i , and mg ii in figure  [ fig : spex ] resembles that from the pistol star and other b[e ] supergiants , of stars , and lbvs .",
    "all of these spectral types represent massive stars that have evolved off of the main sequence , but not yet reached the wolf - rayet phase , so the similarities are understandable . for h2 ,",
    "our results match the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our suggestion that these stars are b[e ] , of , or lbv stars suggests that they are unusually luminous . to confirm this",
    ", we estimate the intrinsic colors and luminosities of  and h2 as follows .",
    "first , we assume that they lie near the galactic center ( @xmath55@xmath568 kpc ) , because ( 1 ) the interstellar absorption columns that we measure from their x - ray spectra ( table  [ tab : spec ] ) are quite similar to the value toward , @xmath57 @xmath28 , and ( 2 ) if we ignore the heavily - absorbed half of the galaxy more distant than 10  kpc , @xmath58% of the galactic stellar mass along this line - of - sight is located within @xmath10200 pc of the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the distance modulus is therefore 14.5 .",
    "second , we estimate the reddening using the relationship @xmath59 from @xcite , and the extinction law from from @xcite . for , taking @xmath60  @xmath28 , we find @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "its intrinsic color is @xmath63 , and absolute @xmath64 . for h2 , @xmath65  @xmath28 , we find @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "its intrinsic color is @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . in both cases ,",
    "the colors are within 1@xmath70 of @xmath71 expected for o supergiant stars @xcite .",
    "however , the colors are inconsistent with the @xmath72 infrared excesses seen from b[e ] stars in the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "therefore , we tentatively classify  and h2 as either of or candidate lbv stars .",
    "we estimate the bolometric luminosities of these stars by assuming that they have temperatures comparable to those of the pistol star and other hot , massive stars in transition , @xmath73 k @xcite .",
    "the bolometric corrections to the absolute @xmath12 magnitudes will then be given by @xmath74 @xcite , so that @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , we find upper limits on the bolometric magnitudes for  of @xmath76 , and for h2 of @xmath77 .",
    "we converted these to _ lower _ limits on the luminosities ( listed in table  [ tab : lxlbol ] ) , and find for  that @xmath78 , and for h2 that @xmath79 .",
    "their true luminosities may be significantly higher .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath80=30,000 k , as would be appropriate for an of star , the bolometric luminosity would be a factor of 7 higher .",
    "although  and h2 are very luminous stars , it is nonetheless surprising that they are so bright in the radio , mid - infrared , and x - rays .",
    "free - free emission in the winds of massive , evolving stars stars should make them mjy radio sources from the distance to the galactic center ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the point - like radio source consistent with  is consistent with a stellar wind .",
    "we can estimate the required mass - loss rate by inverting eq .  4 in @xcite : @xmath81^{3/4 }   \\frac{\\mu_e v_{\\infty}}{10 ^ 2~{\\rm km / s}}~m_\\odot~{\\rm yr}^{-1}.\\ ] ]",
    "if we assume the electron temperature in units of @xmath82  k is @xmath83 , the mean atomic weight per free electron is @xmath84 , and the terminal velocity of the wind is @xmath85  km s@xmath6 as appropriate for an lbv ( e.g. , p cyg in * ? ? ? * ) , then @xmath86 mjy implies @xmath87",

    "@xcite have identified dusty ring nebulae around several known and candidate lbv stars , and hypothesize that they were produced by past episodes of rapid mass loss .",
    "surprisingly , the mid - infrared counterparts to our galactic center stars are @xmath110 and 100 times more luminous at 14.7 and 21.3 @xmath9 m , respectively , than the nebulae around the other candidate lbvs .",

    "there are several possible explanations .",
    "one is that the x - ray emitting shocks form at varying optical depths within the winds of massive stars , so that in some cases the x - ray emission is absorbed before it can reach the observer .",
    "this has been proposed to explain why carbon - type wr stars are faint x - ray sources , whereas nitrogen - type wr stars are bright in x - rays @xcite .",
    "however , changes in the optical depth of the wind from  are unlikely to explain the x - ray flare observed in 2004 july (  2.1 ) .",
    "alternatively , the x - rays from  and h2 could be produced when their winds collide with those of fainter companions .",
    "for instance , it has been proposed that the high x - ray luminosity of @xmath94 car is produced because it is a binary , and one of the components has a fast , @xmath99 km s@xmath6 wind that collides with the slow , dense wind of its companion @xcite . finally , these stars could have black hole or neutron star companions that produce x - rays as they accrete from the wind of the supergiant .",
    "this would make  and h2 analogous to faint high - mass x - ray binaries such as a 0535 + 26 and x per , which have similar x - ray spectra and luminosities @xcite , and exhibit prominent he i and br-@xmath0 emission in their spectra @xcite . both colliding - wind binaries and accreting compact objects exhibit x - ray flares similar to that seen from .",
    "further high - resolution spectroscopic observations will allow us to model the winds from  and h2 , and to search for evidence for binary companions .",
    "given the scatter in @xmath92 in table  [ tab : lxlbol ] , it is not surprising that we did not detect x - ray emission from the remaining three stars from @xcite .",
    "the spectra from @xcite suggest that these stars are all in similar evolutionary states as  and h2 .",
    "if we make similar assumptions to compute their @xmath100 , we find that the remaining stars are a only factor of a few less luminous than  and h2 .",
    "however , if we assume that they are producing x - rays with characteristic temperatures of @xmath490.5 kev , then most of the x - ray emission would be undetectable through the absorption toward the galactic center , and from the upper limits in  2.1 we find @xmath101 .",
    "these limits are not particularly interesting in the context of x - ray emission from massive stars .",
    "nonetheless , we can confidently state these stars are at least an order of magnitude fainter than  and h2 in the observable 28 kev band ( table  [ tab : prop ] ) , which highlights the oddity of the latter two sources .      hot , post - main sequence wolf - rayet , b[e ] , of , and lbv stars similar to those in table  [ tab : prop ] are thought to have initial masses of @xmath102 @xmath5  @xcite , and ages of only a few million years . as a result ,",

    "surprisingly , unlike the pistol star and the massive stars in the central parsec around  @xcite , none of the stars in table  [ tab : prop ] are associated with any known young star cluster .",
    "however , clusters less massive than the arches and quintuplet would be difficult to identify against the dense background of stars in the galactic center using previous wide - field infrared surveys like 2mass @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to carry out photometric and narrow - line surveys to search for other young stars in the vicinity of h2 and , to establish whether they are in fact isolated .",
    "if they are isolated , then there are two possible explanations .",
    "first , it has been suggested that the young stars in the central parsec are the remnants of a cluster that was formed @xmath410 pc from  and settled into the galactic center @xcite , and stars like h2 and  could have been stripped from this hypothetical cluster .",
    "if this is the case , then hundreds of other young stars still await discovery in the central 10 parsecs around  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , these massive , young stars may well have formed in isolation , as has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis would imply that stars form in associations that have masses ranging from 100 to @xmath7  @xmath5 .",
    "such a conclusion would be surprising , since the high turbulent velocities of molecular clouds , the large tidal forces produced by  and the surrounding stellar cusp , and possibly mg magnetic fields concentrated near the galactic center by in - falling material should collude to make the jeans mass closer to the upper end of this range @xcite .",
    "we thank d. figer , a. cotera , e. feigelson , l. townsley , and j. s. clark for very helpful discussions about the natures of these young stars , and s. eikenberry for helpful advice about identifying counterparts to the x - ray sources .",

    "<S> we have carried out a pilot project to assess the feasibility of using radio , infrared , and x - ray emission to identify young , massive stars located between 1 and 25 pc from the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> we first compared catalogs compiled from the very large array , the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , and 2mass . </S>",
    "<S> we identified two massive , young stars : the previously - identified star that is associated with the radio hii region h2 , and a newly - identified star that we refer to as . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared spectra of both stars exhibit very strong brackett-@xmath0 and he i lines , and resemble those of massive supergiants that have evolved off of the main sequence , but not yet reached the wolf - rayet phase . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that each star has a bolometric luminosity @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these two stars are also associated with bright mid - infrared sources from the _ midcourse space experiment _ </S>",
    "<S> survey , although the origin of this emission is uncertain . likewise , the detection of these two sources in x - rays is surprising , because stars at similar evolutionary states are not uniformly bright x - ray sources . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we suggest that both stars are in binary systems that contain either ob stars whose winds collide with those of the luminous supergiants , or compact objects that are accreting from the winds of the supergiants </S>",
    "<S> . we also identify x - ray emission from a nitrogen - type wolf - rayet star and place upper limits on the x - ray luminosities of three more evolved , massive stars that previously have been identified between 1 and 25 pc from sgr a*. finally , we briefly discuss the implications that future searches for young stars will have for our understanding of the recent history of star formation near the galactic center . </S>"
