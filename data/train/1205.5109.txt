    "social networks , which specify the pairs of individuals that are directly connected and those that are not , are substrates of social interactions .",
    "an important caveat in the use of social networks for understanding social behavior is that the pair of directly connected individuals does not interact all the time .",
    "social events between a pair of individuals , such as dialogues and transmission of email , are better described as a sequence of events , i.e. , a collection of tagged event times , where the tag includes , for example , the identity of the two individuals , type of the event , duration , and content of dialogues .",
    "in fact , recent massive data , mostly online , and technological developments of recording devices for offline social interaction enable recording of social events with a higher temporal ( and spatial ) precision than before . examples of data taken in this domain include calling activity @xcite , web recommendation writing @xcite , email traffic @xcite , online forum dealing with sexual escorts @xcite , human interactions in the real space @xcite , to name a few .",
    "transmission of infection or information may occur only during the period in which two individuals are involved in an event .",
    "a set of such event sequences among pairs of individuals are collectively called the temporal network @xcite , which is the focus of this volume .",
    "computational models that generate realistic event sequences possessing properties such as those described in secs .",
    "[ sub : long tail iet ] and [ sub : iet correlation ] would help us understand the nature of human communication behavior .",
    "in many empirical event sequences that we would like to model , interevent times are distributed according to a long - tailed distribution .",
    "the survivor functions ( also called the complementary cumulative distributions ) of iet ( i.e. , the probability that the iet is larger than a given value @xmath0 ) , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iet dist ] for two individuals in the data sets used in our previous study @xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ sub : data sets ] for descriptions of the data ) .",
    "different mechanisms seem to explain the non - poissonian behavior of the iet .",
    "a first mechanism that was discovered to generate power - law iet distributions is a priority queue model @xcite . in this class of models ,",
    "each task corresponding to an event carries a priority level and arrives at a queue .",
    "then , the queue tends to execute tasks with high priority ; tasks with low priority are made to wait for a long time before being executed .",
    "the priority queue model has also been extended to allow for interaction of two priority queues between a pair of interacting individuals @xcite . however , some types of social interaction including conversations may not proceed like a queue . therefore , we attempt an alternative approach in the present chapter .",
    "another facet of actual event sequences is that they often possess positive temporal correlation . in other words ,",
    "a long ( short ) iet is likely to be followed by a long ( short ) iet .",
    "this is the case even if the effect of circadian fluctuations is removed from data @xcite .",
    "although there are various methods to measure temporal correlation of the iet @xcite , here we show it by simply measuring the conditional mean iet defined by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the @xmath3th iet in a sequence , and @xmath4 represents the average . if the iet correlation is absent , @xmath5 is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the values of @xmath6 are plotted against @xmath0 in figs .",
    "[ fig : conditional iet](a ) , [ fig : conditional iet](b ) , and [ fig : conditional iet](c ) for the conversation sequences used in fig .",
    "[ fig : iet dist ] , times of email sending and receiving in a university @xcite , and times of online sexual escorts by male individuals @xcite , respectively .",
    "we remark that long - tailed iet distributions are known for the email @xcite and sexual escort @xcite data sets .",
    "the conditional mean iet @xmath6 increases with @xmath0 in figs .",
    "[ fig : conditional iet](a ) and [ fig : conditional iet](b ) .",
    "therefore , adjacent iets are positively correlated . in fig .",
    "[ fig : conditional iet](c ) , @xmath6 decreases with @xmath0 for @xmath7 and increases with @xmath0 for @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig : conditional iet](c ) suggests that those who have bought an escort tend to avoid buying a next escort within a week .",
    "this is directly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conditional iet](d ) , which shows the iet distribution .",
    "however , adjacent iets for the sexual escort data are positively correlated on a longer time scale ( fig .",
    "[ fig : conditional iet](c ) ) .    in the discrete time model proposed in @xcite , the probability of an event occurrence decreases if events occurred too frequently in the recent past and increases if the time since the last event becomes long .",
    "such a mechanism may generate positive iet correlation .",
    "an alternative mechanism that yields positive iet correlation is self - excitation .",
    "the idea is that once an individual talks with somebody , the individual is excited to talk with somebody with a higher rate .",
    "malmgren and coworkers developed such models and applied to data @xcite .    in the cascading nonhomogeneous poisson process proposed in @xcite",
    ", the authors assumed that the primary process is an inhomogeneous poisson process with a periodic event rate . an event generated from the primary process",
    "is assumed to elevate the system to the active state and trigger cascades of activity .",
    "in other words , after a trigger event , a burst of events may ensue as a result of the poisson process with a rate that is larger than the base rate of the primary process .",
    "the entire recording period is divided into alternately appearing intervals of the active state with a high event rate and the normal state with a low event rate by an adjustment of the position and number of intervals to yield a good fit to the data . as a result",
    ", the number of events contained in a burst is shown to obey an approximate exponential distribution ( also see @xcite , which shows that the number of events in a burst obeys a power law distribution ; the definition of burst is different in the two papers ) . with a circadian and weekly rate modulation ,",
    "the cascading nonhomogeneous poisson process is capable of producing the long - tailed iet distributions observed in the data .",
    "their model has many parameters to be estimated .",
    "this is common to their another model proposed in @xcite . in @xcite , letter writing activity of each renowned individual",
    "is fitted by a cascading poisson process model .",
    "the time unit is set to a day .",
    "the two parameters , i.e. , the base event rate and tendency to write an additional letter within a time unit , are estimated on the basis of the data .",
    "because the different parameter values are assumed for different sections of the data , the number of the parameters in the model can be large . in the case of the letter correspondence by einstein ,",
    "data are collected over 54 years , and the two parameters are estimated for each year",
    ". therefore , there are 108 parameters .",
    "these models @xcite are quite successful in capturing properties of the real event sequences .",
    "nevertheless , it may be also fruitful to consider a much simpler self - excitatory model as a complementary approach to capture the origins of bursts ( sec .  [",
    "sub : long tail iet ] ) and iet correlation ( sec .",
    "[ sub : iet correlation ] ) inherent in human behavior .    a simple two state model in which normal and excited states are assumed is proposed in @xcite .",
    "the model is not a hidden markov model because the probability of staying in the excited state becomes large as the number of events that have already occurred in the current burst increases .",
    "the model reproduces properties of the original data such as the power - law iet distribution and autocorrelation function .",
    "however , statistical methods to estimate the model parameters from the data were not presented @xcite .      in this chapter ,",
    "we fit the self - excitatory point process model called the hawkes process @xcite to the data recorded in company offices @xcite ( also see fig .",
    "[ fig : iet dist ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : conditional iet](a ) ) .",
    "a main benefit for using the hawkes process is that it contains a small number of parameters and is mathematically tractable ; the maximum likelihood ( ml ) method for inferring parameter values is established for some important special cases @xcite .",
    "this chapter is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : def hawkes ] , we introduce the hawkes model and recapitulate its basic mathematical properties . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iet hawkes ] , we numerically investigate properties of event sequences generated by the hawkes process . in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] , we carry out the ml estimation of the parameters of the hawkes model and compare the data and the estimated model . in sec .  [",
    "sec : discussion ] , we discuss the results , with an emphasis on the limitation and possible extensions of the hawkes model for better describing human data .",
    "mathematical details are delegated to two appendices .",
    "the hawkes process is a self - exciting point process model that is analytically tractable .",
    "it is an inhomogeneous poisson process in which the instantaneous event rate depends on the history of the time series of events .",
    "it is not a renewal process .",
    "the event rate at time @xmath9 , denoted by @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the time of the @xmath3th event , and @xmath13 is the memory kernel , i.e. , the additional rate incurred by an event .",
    "the causality implies @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the hawkes process has been used for modeling , for example , seismological data @xcite , video viewing activities @xcite , neural spike trains @xcite , and genomic data @xcite .",
    "for example , in @xcite , time series of views of different videos on youtube were categorized into three classes , which were characterized by different @xmath13 and different time - dependent versions of @xmath16 .",
    "the hawkes process has also been used to construct a method to estimate the structure of neural networks from given spike trains @xcite , analyze auto and cross correlation in data recorded from mouse retina @xcite , and understand the correlation between the activities of different neurons in pulse - coupled model networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the hawkes process is used to model stochastic occurrences of specific genes on dna sequences . the method to estimate a piecewise linear @xmath13 based on the least square error was presented .",
    "depending on applications , the memory kernel @xmath13 has been assumed to be a hyperbolic ( i.e. , power law ) function @xcite or a superposition of the gamma function @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the present work , we simply set @xmath17 for the following reasons .",
    "first , it allows the ml estimation of the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "second , the hawkes process with eq .",
    "has a small number of parameters as compared to competitive models with self excitation @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that eq .",
    "indicates that the self - exciting effect of an event decays in time .",
    "it is contrasted with a previous model in which the self - exciting effect is constant for some time and then the event rate returns to the basal rate @xcite .",
    "an example time course of the event rate @xmath10 and the corresponding event sequence are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : example rate hawkes ] .    we define cluster of events as the set of events that are triggered by a single event occurring at the basal rate @xmath16 . in other words ,",
    "all the events in a cluster are descendants of the trigger event .",
    "the expected cluster size is given by @xcite @xmath20 and the stationary event rate is given by @xmath21 the convergence of the event rate requires @xmath22 .",
    "in this section , we numerically examine basic properties of the hawkes process with the exponential memory kernel . to quantify the broadness of the iet distribution",
    ", we measure the coefficient of variation ( cv ) , defined as the standard deviation of the iet divided by the mean of the iet as follows : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of iets in a given sequence and @xmath25 is the mean iet .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath26 in the limit @xmath27 is equal to @xmath28 .",
    "the poisson process yields cv @xmath29 .",
    "we also measure the correlation coefficient for the iet @xcite defined as @xmath30    the hawkes process is invariant under the following rescaling of the time and parameter values : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a constant .",
    "therefore , we normalize the time by setting @xmath36 and vary @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the values of cv , iet correlation , and mean cluster size @xmath37 are invariant under this rescaling .",
    "for a given pair of @xmath18 and @xmath19 values , we generate a time series with @xmath38 events using the method described in @xcite and calculate the statistics of the iet .",
    "the values of cv , iet correlation , and @xmath37 ( eq .  ) for various @xmath18 and @xmath19 values are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stat iet hawkes p=0](a ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : stat iet hawkes p=0](b ) , and fig .",
    "[ fig : stat iet hawkes p=0](c ) , respectively .",
    "although we can more theoretically calculate cv using the expression of the iet distribution @xcite ( also see appendix 1 for details ) , it is numerically demanding to do so .",
    "therefore , we resorted to direct numerical simulations .",
    "the data are present only in the region @xmath22 , where the hawkes process does not explode .    figure  [ fig : stat iet hawkes p=0](a ) indicates that the hawkes process generates a wide range of cv . a large value of @xmath39 yields a large cv value .",
    "this is the case for both small and large @xmath18 values . in fig .",
    "[ fig : iet dist examples ] , the survival function of the iet on the basis of @xmath38 events is compared for different @xmath18 and @xmath19 values that satisfy @xmath40 or @xmath41 . although the cv values are large , the iet distributions are consistently different from power law distributions .",
    "in particular , the iet distribution seems to be a superposition of multiple distributions with different time scales when @xmath18 is large ( fig .",
    "[ fig : iet dist examples](c ) ) .",
    "it should be noted that we assumed the exponential , not long - tailed , memory kernel ( eq .  ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : stat iet hawkes p=0](b ) indicates that a large @xmath42 value also yields a large iet correlation .",
    "once the event rate increases because of recent occurrences of other events , the following iet tends to be small .",
    "therefore , strong self - excitation in the model ( i.e. , large @xmath42 ) is considered to cause large iet correlation .",
    "the strength of self - excitation can be also quantified by @xmath37 .",
    "figure  [ fig : stat iet hawkes p=0](c ) indicates that a large @xmath42 tends to yield a large @xmath37 .",
    "figures  [ fig : stat iet hawkes p=0](a ) , [ fig : stat iet hawkes p=0](b ) , and [ fig : stat iet hawkes p=0](c ) look similar , suggesting that the three quantities are correlated with each other .",
    "we analyze two data sets @xmath43 and @xmath44 of face - to - face interaction logs obtained from different company offices in japan . world signal center , hitachi , ltd . , japan collected the data using the business microscope system developed by hitachi , ltd .",
    ", japan . for technical details concerning the data collection ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we previously analyzed the data using different methods @xcite .",
    "data sets @xmath43 and @xmath44 consist of recordings from 163 individuals for 73 days and 211 individuals for 120 days , respectively .",
    "the two individuals are defined to be involved in a conversation event , simply called the event , if their modules exchange the ids at least once in a minute .",
    "the module has other types of data that we do not use in the present study , such as the list of conversation partners and the duration of each event . in total ,",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 contain 51,879 and 125,345 events , respectively .      for the entire sequence of event times obtained for each individual",
    ", we carry out the ml estimation of the parameters of the hawkes process with the exponential memory kernel .",
    "it should be noted that we use the information about event times and not the duration of events or the partners ids .",
    "we slightly modify the ml method developed in @xcite ( see appendix 2 for details ) .",
    "the modification is concerned with the treatment of the data during the night .",
    "our data are nonstationary owing to the circadian and weekly rhythms .",
    "therefore , direct application of the hawkes process , which is a stationary point process , is invalid . in the previous literature in which different models are investigated , these rhythms",
    "are explicitly modeled @xcite or treated by dynamically changing the time scale according to the event rate @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we omit the night part of the data from the analysis because our data are collected in company offices and therefore there is no event from late in the night through early in the morning .    in both data sets @xmath43 and @xmath44 , there is nobody in the office between four and six in the morning .",
    "accordingly , we can partition the data into workdays without ambiguity . for each individual",
    ", we discard the workdays that contain less than 40 conversation events .",
    "we call a workday containing at least 40 events the valid day . then , we define the first event in each valid day as trigger event and set @xmath45 . the following events on the same valid day are interpreted to be generated from the hawkes process .",
    "the time of the last event denoted by @xmath46 ( denoted by @xmath47 in appendix 2 ) is defined to be the end time of the valid day ; it is necessary to specify @xmath46 to apply the ml method ( appendix 2 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath46 depends on individuals even on the same day .",
    "the individual may stay in the office for a considerable amount of time after @xmath48 before leaving the office .",
    "this implies that the individual does not have conversations with others remaining in the office between @xmath48 and the time when the individual leaves the office . if this is the case , the fact that this individual does not have events for @xmath49 may affect the ml estimators",
    ". nevertheless , we neglect this point .",
    "finally , we obtain the likelihood of the series of events for an individual by multiplying the likelihood for all the valid days .",
    "we apply the ml method to the individuals that possess at least 300 valid iets ( i.e. , iets derived from the valid days ) during the entire period .",
    "this thresholding leaves 63 individuals in @xmath43 and 148 individuals in @xmath44 .",
    "we also exclude one individual in @xmath43 because the ml method does not converge for this individual .",
    "the survivor function of the iet is compared between the data and the estimated hawkes process in fig .",

    "we calculated the iet distribution for the estimated model using the theoretical method @xcite ( appendix 1 ) .",
    "the agreement between the iet distributions of the data and the estimated model is excellent .    to assess the quality of the fit at a population level",
    ", we compare three statistics of the iet between the data and model for different individuals .",
    "the relationship between the mean iet obtained from the data and that obtained from the estimated model , i.e. , @xmath28 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare hawkes](a ) . for different individuals in both data sets ,",
    "the mean iet is close between the data and the model .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient between the data and model are equal to 0.993 and 0.986 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",

    "the cv values for the data and the estimated model are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare hawkes](b ) .",
    "we calculated the cv values for the estimated model on the basis of @xmath50 events that we obtained by simulating the hawkes process with the ml estimators @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath16 .",
    "although the cv can be theoretically calculated using the ml estimators ( appendix 1 ) , we avoided doing so because the theoretical method is computationally too costly to be applied to all the individuals . roughly speaking ,",
    "the cv values obtained from the model are close to those of the data .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient between the data and model are equal to 0.832 and 0.936 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .    the iet correlation of the data and that for the estimated model are compared in fig .",

    "we calculated the iet correlation for the estimated model by direct numerical simulations , as in the case of the cv .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare hawkes](c ) indicates that the hawkes process does not reproduce the iet correlation for most individuals .",
    "the iet correlation for the estimated model is distributed in a much narrower range than that of the data .",
    "this is consistent with the finding that the cv and the iet correlation are positively correlated in the hawkes process ( sec .",
    "[ sec : iet hawkes ] ) . because most individuals have the cv values larger than unity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compare hawkes](b ) ) , the estimate of the iet correlation obtained by the model tends to be positive regardless of the estimated values of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath16 .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare hawkes](c ) suggests that the hawkes process with the exponential memory kernel is incapable of approximating the real data in terms of the iet correlation .",
    "we analyzed properties of the iet generated by the hawkes process with an exponential memory kernel and then fitted the model to the face - to - face interaction logs obtained from company offices .",
    "the model successfully reproduced the data in terms of the iet distribution .",
    "however , the model does not explain the behavior of the iet correlation in the data .",
    "this limitation may be because the effect of self - excitation is too strong in the hawkes process ; the event rate can be very large after a burst of events . to examine this issue",
    ", we carry out additional numerical simulations using a modified hawkes model .",

    "it seems that the iet correlation has not been discussed in the context of social interaction data , with a notable exception @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the capabilities of alternative models @xcite in reproducing the iet correlation in the data .    in the present study",
    ", we used the exponential memory kernel because it is analytically tractable and contains only three parameters .",
    "the original hawkes process with other memory kernels has also been applied to data @xcite .",
    "the ml method is available also for this case @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we suspect that self - excitation inherent in the hawkes process induces both high cv and positive iet correlation for a variety of memory kernels .",
    "therefore , the use of different memory kernel may not improve the fit of the hawkes process to our data in terms of the iet correlation .",
    "two - state models @xcite , in which events are produced at high and low rates in the excited and normal states , respectively , are also self - exciting",
    ". these models may be more realistic for social data than the standard hawkes process used in this work in the sense that humans may not distinguish many different levels of self - excitation as is assumed in the hawkes process .",
    "on the other hand , the hawkes process with the exponential memory kernel is simpler than these models such that the ml methods are available and the parameters have simple physical meanings .",
    "although the model by malmgren and colleagues allows for the ml method @xcite , the method is quite complicated and contains many parameters .",
    "it may be desirable to develop two - state models that are simple and allow for statistical methods .",
    "alternatively , it may be desirable to modify the hawkes process to account for the behavior of the iet correlation in the real data .",
    "we lack methods to compare the goodness of fit of different models , except that it is straightforward to test the validity of a model against the poisson process ( but see @xcite ) .",
