    "it is evident that the wavefunction of the bright soliton is independent of the strength of spin - exchange interactions @xmath19 .",

    "the breakdown of the galilean invariance of the so - coupled equation can be explicitly seen by using the transformation @xmath101 , @xmath102 , where @xmath99 is the velocity of the unprimed coordinate system with respect to primed coordinate system , then the wavefunction @xmath65 of ( [ gps-1])-([gps-3 ] ) should transform to @xmath103 as @xmath104 now , substituting ( [ gs ] ) in ( [ gps-1])-([gps-3 ] ) and using @xmath105 and @xmath106 , we obtain @xmath107\\phi_m(x',t ' ) , \\label{mov_sol}\\ ] ] where the terms proportional to @xmath18 and @xmath19 have been suppressed for the sake of simplicity in addition to a @xmath79-dependent additive term which does not contribute to the dynamics .",
    "the presence of the extra term @xmath108 on the right hand side of ( [ mov_sol ] ) shows that the so - coupled hamiltonian is no longer galilean invariant and the so - coupled soliton solution of the gp equation will depend on its velocity @xmath99 . the so - coupled equation ( [ mov_sol ] ) , in the absence of trap and interactions , has the solutions @xmath58 and @xmath59 of eq .",

    "the degeneracy is removed and such a mixing is not possible .",
