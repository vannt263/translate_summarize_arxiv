    "[ [ section ] ]    mesoscopic physics is a sub - discipline of condensed matter physics which deals with systems whose dimensions are intermediate between the microscopic and macroscopic length scales  @xcite . in meso - scale region fluctuations",
    "play an important role and the systems are treated quantum mechanically , in contrast to the macroscopic objects where usually the laws of classical mechanics are used . in a simple version we can say that a macroscopic system when scaled down to a meso - scale starts exhibiting quantum mechanical phenomena . the most relevant length scale of quantifying a mesoscopic system is probably the phase coherence length @xmath0 , the length scale over which the carriers preserve their phase information .",
    "this phase coherence length is , on the other hand , highly sensitive to temperature and sharply decreases with the rise of temperature .",
    "therefore , to be in the mesoscopic regime we have to lower the temperature sufficiently ( of the order of liquid he ) such that phase randomization process caused by phonons gets minimum .",
    "though there is no such proper definition of the mesoscopic region , but the studied mesoscopic objects are normally in the range of @xmath1-@xmath2 nanometers .",
    "several spectacular effects appear as a consequence of quantum phase coherence of the electronic wave functions in mesoscopic systems like one - dimensional ( @xmath3d ) quantum wires , quantum dots where electrons are fully confined , two - dimensional ( @xmath4d ) electron gases in heterostructures , etc . for our illustrative purposes here we describe very briefly some of these issues .    0.2 cm ( i ) * * one of the most significant experiments in mesoscopic physics is the observation of aharonov - bohm ( ab ) oscillations in conductance of a small metallic ring threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the origin of conductance oscillations lies in the quantum interference among the waves traversing through two arms of the ring .",
    "this pioneering experiment has opened up a wide range of challenging and new physical concepts in the mesoscopic regime .",
    "0.2 cm ( ii ) * * the pronounced fluctuations in conductance of a disordered system are observed when the temperature is lowered below @xmath3k  @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations are originated from the interference effects of the electronic wave functions traveling across the system and are fully different from the fluctuations observed in traditional macroscopically large objects .",
    "the notable feature of conductance fluctuations in the mesoscopic regime is that their magnitudes are always of the order of the conductance quantum @xmath6 , and accordingly , these fluctuations are treated as ` universal conductance fluctuations '  @xcite .    0.2 cm ( iii ) * * in thermodynamic equilibrium a small metallic ring threaded by magnetic flux @xmath5 supports a current that does not decay dissipatively even at non - zero temperature .",
    "it is the well - known phenomenon of persistent current in mesoscopic normal metal rings  @xcite .",
    "this is a purely quantum mechanical effect and gives an obvious demonstration of the ab effect  @xcite .",
    "0.2 cm ( iv ) * * the integer quantum hall effect is probably the best example of quantum phase coherence of electronic wave functions in two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) systems  @xcite . in the hall experiment , a current is allowed to pass through a conductor ( 2deg ) , and , the longitudinal voltage @xmath7 and transverse hall voltage @xmath8 are measured as a function of the applied magnetic field @xmath9 which is perpendicular to the plane of the conductor . in the limit of weak magnetic field ,",
    "the hall resistance @xmath10 varies linearly with the field strength @xmath9 , while the longitudinal resistance @xmath11 remains unaffected by this field .",
    "these features can be explained by the classical drude model . on the other hand for strong magnetic field and in the limit of low temperature",
    "a completely different behavior is observed and the classical drude model fails to explain the results . in high",
    "magnetic field @xmath11 shows oscillatory nature , while @xmath10 shows step - like behavior with sharp plateaus . on these plateaus",
    "the values of @xmath10 are given by @xmath12 , @xmath13 being an integer , and they are highly reproducible with great precision .",
    "these values are extremely robust so that they are often used as the standard of resistance .",
    "the integer quantum hall effect is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon due to the formation of the landau levels and many good reviews on iqhe are available in the literature  @xcite .",
    "0.2 cm ( v ) * * unlike the integer quantum hall effect , at too high magnetic fields and low temperatures , a two - dimensional electron gas shows additional plateaus in the hall resistance at fractional filling factors  @xcite .",
    "it has been verified that the coulomb correlation between the electrons becomes important for the interpretation of the fractional quantum hall effect and the presence of fractional filling has been traced back to the existence of correlated collective quasi - particle excitations  @xcite .",
    "extensive reviews on this topic can be found in the literature  @xcite .    in the mesoscopic regime",
    ", electronic transport can not be investigated by using the conventional boltzmann transport equation since at this length scale quantum phase coherence plays an important role and a full quantum mechanical treatment is needed  @xcite . in an ` open system ' the landauer approach  @xcite of ` two - terminal conductance ' provides an elegant technique to reveal the transport mechanisms . in the landauer formalism",
    "a quantum system is sandwiched between two macroscopic reservoirs , the so - called electrodes , those are kept at thermal equilibrium . by applying a bias voltage we tune the chemical potentials of these electrodes .",
    "the main signature of the electrodes is that electrons passing through them along the longitudinal direction can be described as plane waves and suffer no backscattering whatsoever .",
    "this allows us to describe the properties of the conductor in terms of its scattering matrix @xmath14 on the basis of plane waves within the electrodes .",
    "the landauer formulation is probably the simplest and elegant approach for studying electron transport in low - dimensional quantum systems",
    ".    ongoing trend of miniaturizing electronic devices eventually approaches the ultimate limit where even a single molecule can be used as an electrical circuit element .",
    "idea of devicing a single molecule as the building block of future generation electronics seems fascinating because of the possibility to assemble a large number of molecules onto a chip i.e. , remarkable enhancement in integration density can take place  @xcite .",
    "discovery of sophisticated molecular scale measurement methodologies such as scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , scanning electro - chemical microscopy ( secm ) , etc . , have made it possible to study electron transport phenomena in molecular bridge systems  @xcite .",
    "the idea of using molecules as active components of a device was suggested by aviram and ratner  @xcite over three decades ago . since then",
    "several ab - initio and model calculations have been performed to investigate molecular transport theoretically  @xcite .",
    "but experimental realizations took a little longer time to get feasible . in @xmath15 , reed and co - workers  @xcite have studied the current - voltage ( @xmath16-@xmath17 ) characteristics of a single benzene molecule attached to electrodes via thiol groups . later",
    "various other experiments have been made to explore many interesting features e.g. , ballistic transport , quantized conductance , negative differential resistance ( ndr )  @xcite , molecular transistor operation  @xcite to name a few .    in short",
    "we can say that the rapid progress of theoretical as well as experimental works on mesoscopic physics over the last few decades proves that it is a highly exciting and challenging branch of condensed matter physics and we hope that it will be continuing for many more decades .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    in this dissertation we address several important issues on electron transport through some meso - scale systems which are quite challenging from the standpoint of theoretical as well as experimental research .",
    "a brief outline of the presentation is as follow .    on the meso - scale organic molecules , cluster of atoms , quantum dots , carbon nanotubes , etc .",
    ", can be produced with flexible and tunable conduction properties and these new realities have tremendous technological importance .",
    "the physics of electron transport through such devices is surprisingly rich .",
    "many fundamental experimentally observed phenomena in such devices can be understood by using simple arguments .",
    "in particular , the formal relation between conductance and transmission coefficients ( the landauer formula ) has enhanced the understanding of electronic transport in the molecular bridge system . to reveal these facts , in the first part of this review we investigate electron transport properties of some molecular bridge systems within the tight - binding framework using green s function technique and try to explain the behavior of electron conduction in the aspects of quantum interference of electronic wave functions , molecule - to - electrode coupling strength , molecular length , etc .",
    "our model calculations provide a physical insight to the behavior of electron conduction through molecular bridge systems .",
    "next , we explore the possibilities of designing classical logic gates at meso - scale level using simple mesoscopic rings . a single ring is used for designing or , not , xor , xnor and nand gates , while and and nor gate responses are achieved using two such rings and in all these cases each ring is threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath5 which plays the central role in the logic gate operation .",
    "we adopt a simple tight - binding hamiltonian to describe the model where a mesoscopic ring is attached to two semi - infinite one - dimensional non - magnetic electrodes .",
    "based on single particle green s function formalism all calculations which describe two - terminal conductance and current through the quantum ring are performed numerically . the analysis may be helpful in fabricating mesoscopic or nano - scale logic gates .    finally ,",
    "in the last part , we focus our attention on the multi - terminal transport problem . here",
    "we no longer use the landauer approach .",
    "bttiker has extended the study of two - terminal quantum transport into the multi - terminal case which is known as landauer - bttiker formalism . with this approach",
    "we study multi - terminal quantum transport in a single benzene molecule to examine the transport properties in terms of conductance , reflection probability and current - voltage characteristics .",
    "molecular electronics is an essential technological concept of fast - growing interest since molecules constitute promising building blocks for future generation of electronic devices where electronic transport becomes coherent  @xcite . for purposeful design of an electronic circuit using a single molecule or a cluster of molecules ,",
    "the most important requirement is the understanding of fundamental processes of electron conduction through separate molecules used in the circuit . a fruitful discussion of electron transport in a molecular wire",
    "was first studied theoretically by aviram and ratner during 1974  @xcite .",
    "later , numerous experiments have been made in different molecules placed between electrodes with few nano - meter separation  @xcite .",
    "it is very crucial to control electron transmission through such molecular electronic devices , and , though extensive studies have been done , yet the present understanding about it is not fully explored .",
    "for example , it is not very clear how molecular conduction is affected by geometry of the molecule itself or by the nature of its coupling to side attached electrodes . to construct an electronic device made with molecules and to utilize it properly",
    "we need a deep analysis of structure - conductance relationship . in a recent work ernzerhof _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have illustrated a general design principle based on several model calculations to reveal this concept . in presence of applied bias voltage",
    "a current passes through the molecule - electrode junction and it becomes a non - linear function of the applied voltage .",
    "the detailed description of it is quite complicated .",
    "electron transport properties in molecular systems are highly sensitive on several quantum effects like quantum interference of electronic waves passing through different arms of the molecular rings , quantization of energy levels , etc .",
    "the main motivation of studying molecular transport is that molecules are currently the subject of substantial theoretical , experimental and technological interest .",
    "using molecules we can design logic gates , molecular switches , several transport elements that need to be well characterized and explained .    in this section",
    "we address the behavior of electron transport through some polycyclic hydrocarbon molecules based on a simple tight - binding framework .",
    "though several _ ab initio _  @xcite methods are used to enumerate electron transport in molecular systems , but simple parametric approaches are rather much helpful to understand the basic mechanisms of electron transport in detail . beside this here we also make our attention only on the qualitative effects instead of the quantitative results which also motivate us to perform model calculations in the transport problem .    to describe the behavior of molecular transport",
    "let us first construct the methodology for two - terminal quantum transport through a simple finite sized conductor .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    we begin with fig .  [ wire ] . a finite sized @xmath3d conductor with @xmath18 atomic sites",
    "is attached to two semi - infinite @xmath3d metallic electrodes , viz , source and drain . at much low temperature and bias voltage ,    conductance @xmath19 of the conductor",
    "can be written by using landauer conductance formula , @xmath20 where , @xmath21 is the transmission probability of an electron through the conductor . in terms of the green s function of the conductor and its coupling to the side",

    "i.e. , the conductor and two electrodes , the green s function becomes , @xmath27 @xmath28 is the injecting energy of the source electron and @xmath29 is the hamiltonian of the combined system .",
    "evaluation of this green s function requires the inversion of an infinite matrix as the system consists of the finite size conductor and two semi - infinite @xmath3d electrodes , which is really a very difficult task .",
    "however , the entire system can be partitioned into sub - matrices corresponding to the individual sub - systems , and then the green s function for the conductor can be effectively written as , @xmath30 where , @xmath31 is the hamiltonian of the conductor . withing a non - interacting picture",
    ", the tight - binding hamiltonian of the conductor looks like , @xmath32 @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron at site @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the site energy of an electron at the @xmath35-th site and @xmath37 corresponds to the nearest - neighbor hopping integral .",
    "a similar kind of tight - binding hamiltonian is also used for the description of electrodes where the hamiltonian is parametrized by constant on - site potential @xmath38 and nearest - neighbor hopping integral @xmath39 . in eq .",
    "[ grc ] , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the self - energy operators due to the two electrodes , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the green s functions for the source and drain , respectively . @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the coupling matrices and they will be non - zero only for the adjacent points in the conductor , @xmath3 and @xmath18 as shown in fig .",
    "[ wire ] , and the electrodes respectively .",
    "the coupling terms @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the conductor can be calculated from the following expression , @xmath46.\\ ] ] here , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the retarded and advanced self - energies , respectively , and they are conjugate to each other .",

    "since this broadening is much larger than the thermal broadening we restrict our all calculations only at absolute zero temperature .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the self - energies can be determined in terms of the hopping integral ( @xmath52 ) between the boundary sites ( @xmath3 and @xmath18 ) of the conductor and electrodes , energy ( @xmath28 ) of the transmitting electron and hopping strength ( @xmath39 ) between nearest - neighbor sites of the electrodes .",

    "thus , by calculating the self - energies , the coupling terms @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be easily obtained and then the transmission probability ( @xmath21 ) will be calculated from the expression as presented in eq .",

    "we establish the current - voltage relation from the expression  @xcite , @xmath58 where , @xmath59 is the equilibrium fermi energy .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , here we assume that the entire voltage is dropped across the conductor - electrode interfaces and it does nt greatly affect the qualitative aspects of the current - voltage characteristics .",
    "this is due to the fact that the electric field inside the conductor , especially for shorter conductors , seems to have a minimal effect on the conductance - voltage characteristics . on the other hand , for quite larger conductors and higher bias voltages , the electric field inside the conductor may play a more significant role depending on the internal structure of the conductor  @xcite , though the effect becomes too small . using the expression of @xmath60 ( eq .",

    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    based on the above two - terminal transport formulation , in this section , we describe the behavior of electron conduction through some polycyclic hydrocarbon molecules those are schematically shown in fig .  [ hydro ] .",
    "the molecules are : benzene ( one ring ) , napthalene ( two rings ) , anthracene ( three rings ) and tetracene ( four rings ) .",
    "these molecules are connected to the electrodes ( source and drain ) via thiol ( s - h bond ) groups . in real experimental situations , gold ( au ) electrodes",
    "are generally used and the molecules are coupled to them through thiol groups in the chemisorption technique where hydrogen ( h ) atoms removes ans sulfur ( s ) atoms reside . to emphasize the effect of quantum interference on electron transport , we couple the molecules to the source and drain in two different configurations .",
    "one is defined as _ cis _",
    "configuration where two electrodes are placed at the @xmath64 sites , whereas in the other arrangement , called as _ trans _ configuration , electrodes are connected at the @xmath65 sites .",
    "molecular coupling is another important factor which controls the electron transport . to justify this fact ,",
    "here we describe the essential features of electron transport for the two limiting cases of molecular coupling .",
    "one is the weak - coupling limit which mathematically treated as @xmath66 and in the other case we have @xmath67 which is defined as the strong - coupling limit . @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the hopping strengths of the molecule to the source and    drain , respectively .",
    "the common set of values of the parameters used in the calculation are as follows .",
    "@xmath70 , @xmath71 ( weak - coupling ) and @xmath72 , @xmath71 ( strong - coupling ) . in the electrodes we set @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",

    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ transcond ] , we show the behavior of conductance ( @xmath19 ) as a function of injecting electron energy ( @xmath28 ) for the hydrocarbon molecules when they are coupled to the electrodes in the _ trans _ configuration , where ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) correspond to the benzene , napthalene , anthracene and tetracene molecules , respectively . in the limit of weak molecular coupling ,",
    "conductance shows sharp resonant peaks ( solid lines ) for some specific energy eigenvalues , while it drops almost to zero for all other energies . at the resonance ,",
    "conductance approaches to @xmath4 , and therefore , the transmission probability ( @xmath21 ) becomes unity ( from the landauer conductance formula @xmath76 in our chosen unit system @xmath77 ) .",
    "the resonant peaks in the conductance spectrum coincide with eigenenergies of the single hydrocarbon molecules .",
    "thus , from the conductance spectrum we can easily implement the electronic structure of a molecule .",
    "the nature of these resonant peaks gets significantly modified when molecular coupling is increased . in the strong - coupling limit ,",
    "width of the resonant peaks gets broadened as shown by the dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ transcond ] and it emphasizes that electron conduction takes place almost for all energy values .",
    "this is due to the broadening of the molecular energy levels , where contribution comes from the imaginary parts of the self - energies @xmath78  @xcite .    to establish the effect of quantum interference on electron transport , in fig .",
    "[ ciscond ] , we plot conductance - energy characteristics for these molecules when they are connected to the electrodes in the _ cis _    configuration .",
    "( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) correspond to the results for the benzene , napthalene , anthracene and tetracene molecules , respectively , where the solid and dotted curves indicate the identical meaning as in fig .",
    "[ transcond ] .",
    "from these spectra we clearly see that some of the conductance peaks do not reach to unity anymore and achieve much reduced amplitude .",
    "this behavior can be justified as follow . during the propagation of electrons from the source to drain , electronic waves",
    "which pass through different arms of the molecular ring / rings can suffer a phase shift among themselves , according to the result of quantum interference .",
    "as a result , probability amplitude of getting an electron across the molecule becomes increased or decreased .",
    "the cancellation of transmission probabilities emphasizes    the appearance of anti - resonant states which provides an interesting feature in the study of electron transport in interferometric geometries . from these conductance - energy spectra",
    "we can predict that electronic transmission is strongly affected by the quantum interference effect or in other words the molecule - to - electrode interface geometry .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    the scenario of electron transport through these molecular wires can be much more clearly explained from current - voltage ( @xmath16-@xmath17 ) spectra .",
    "current through the molecular systems is computed by the integration procedure of transmission function @xmath21 ( see eq .",
    "[ curr ] ) .",
    "the behavior of the transmission function is similar to that of the conductance spectrum since the relation @xmath76 is satisfied from the landauer conductance formula . in fig .",
    "[ transcurr ] , we plot @xmath16-@xmath17 characteristics of the hydrocarbon molecules when they are connected in the _ trans _ configuration to the source and drain , where ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to the currents for the cases of weak- and strong - coupling limits , respectively .",
    "the solid , dotted , dashed and dot - dashed lines represent @xmath16-@xmath17 curves for the benzene , napthalene , anthracene and tetracene molecules , respectively .",
    "it is observed that , in the weak - coupling limit current shows staircase - like structure with sharp steps .",
    "this is due to    the discreteness of molecular resonances as shown by the solid curves in fig .",

    "electrochemical potentials on the electrodes are shifted and eventually cross one of the molecular energy levels . accordingly , a current channel is opened up and a jump in @xmath16-@xmath17 curve appears .",
    "the shape and height of these current steps depend on the width of the molecular resonances . with the increase of molecule - to - electrode coupling strength ,",
    "current varies almost continuously with the applied bias voltage and achieves much higher values , as shown in fig .",
    "[ transcurr](b ) . this continuous variation of",
    "the current is due to the broadening of conductance resonant peaks ( see the dotted curves of fig .",

    "the solid , dotted , dashed and dot - dashed curves give the same meaning as in fig .  [ transcurr ] . in this configuration ( _ cis _ ) , current amplitude    gets reduced enormously than the case when electrodes are coupled to the molecules in the _ trans _ configuration .",
    "this enormous change in current amplitude is caused solely due to the effect of quantum interference between electronic waves passing through the molecular arms .",
    "therefore , we can predict that designing a molecular device is significantly influenced by the quantum interference effect i.e. , molecule - to - electrode interface structure .    to summarize , in this section , we have introduced a parametric approach based on a simple tight - binding model to investigate electron transport properties of four different polycyclic hydrocarbon molecules sandwiched between two @xmath3d metallic electrodes .",

    "electronic transport in quantum confined geometries has attracted much attention since these simple looking systems are the promising building blocks for designing nanodevices especially in electronic as well as spintronic engineering .",
    "the key idea of designing nano - electronic devices is based on the concept of quantum interference , and it is generally preserved throughout the sample having dimension smaller or comparable to the phase coherence length",
    ". therefore , ring type conductors or two path devices are ideal candidates where the effect of quantum interference can be exploited  @xcite .",
    "in such a ring shaped geometry , quantum interference effect can be controlled by several ways , and most probably , the effect can be regulated significantly by tuning the magnetic flux , the so - called aharonov - bohm ( ab ) flux , that threads the ring .    in this section",
