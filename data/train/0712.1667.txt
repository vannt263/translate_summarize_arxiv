    "magnetogenesis mechanisms can operate either primordially or during galaxy formation .",
    "primordial magnetogenesis is particularly appealing , because it can produce seed fields on large scales , and would account for their ubiquity .",
    "several primordial generation mechanisms have been proposed .",
    "for example , magnetic fields can be generated during a first order primordial phase transition  @xcite , and during the electroweak phase transition even if it is second order  @xcite ; magnetic helicity can be generated by parity - violating processes  @xcite ; magnetic fields can also be generated during inflation , if the conformal invariance of electromagnetism is broken in some way  @xcite , or during a pre - big bang  @xcite .",
    "these are only some examples of the generation mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature , many of which are strongly constrained by nucleosynthesis  @xcite .",
    "it is fair to say that there is to date no preferred generation mechanism , and the origin of astrophysical magnetic fields remains an open problem .    in this paper , we concentrate on a mechanism first proposed by harrison  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is the following : during the early radiation era , thomson scattering between electrons and photons is more efficient than coulomb scattering between electrons and protons , so that electrons and photons can be described as a single fluid with a common velocity , in principle different from that of the protons . if , by means of some external mechanism , vortical motion is present in the radiative and proton fluids , then , in the absence of interactions , the vorticities of the two fluids evolve independently .",
    "the different spin - down rates of the photon - electron and proton fluids give rise to non - zero net rotational currents , which in turn can act as sources of magnetic fields .",
    "two fundamental ingredients are needed for this generation process to work .",
    "firstly , one needs an external source of vorticity in the fluids .",
    "secondly , the proton and photon - electron fluids must have different velocities , otherwise there is no current and consequently no magnetic field .    in harrison",
    "s original argument the analysis is newtonian , and some of the assumptions are not made explicit .",
    "we present in section  [ sec : harrison ] a detailed relativistic derivation of the harrison mechanism , consistent at first order in cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "we show that the harrison mechanism can operate when the temperature of the universe is @xmath2 , so that thomson scattering of electrons and photons is more efficient than coulomb scattering of electrons and protons .",
    "moreover , we show that the magnetic field sourced by the harrison mechanism depends only on the initial value of the total vorticity in the fluids .",
    "there is no obvious reason for vorticity to be non - zero , unless there is an external source .",
    "the vorticity might arise from second - order gravitational and scattering effects related to the nonlinear evolution of density perturbations , as studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . at first order",
    ", there is no vorticity from inflationary - generated perturbations , but topological defects are an active source of vector perturbations . in this paper",
    "we analyse the possibility that vorticity in the matter fluids could be driven by topological defects .",
    "we show that , at first order in perturbation theory , and in the absence of electrical currents in the defects themselves , this idea can not work .",
    "we assume that the defects interact with the cosmic fluid only gravitationally , and that they have no significant effect on the background evolution of the universe .",
    "defects are modelled as an inhomogeneously distributed component whose energy momentum tensor has scalar , vector and tensor degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "therefore , defects induce perturbations in the metric at first order , and in particular vector - type perturbations  @xcite .",
    "our main result is presented in section  [ sec : basics ] , where we demonstrate that first - order vector - type metric perturbations can not induce vorticity in perfect fluids without anisotropic stress .",
    "consequently , defects can not act as a source of magnetic fields in such fluids through the harrison mechanism at first order .",
    "we identify fluid anisotropic stress as a possible way around this no - go result .",
    "( if the defects are super - conducting and carry primordial currents , then their magnetic fields can induce magnetic fields in the fluids , at first order  @xcite . )    at early times , baryons and photons have negligible anisotropic stresses on the scales of interest , and consequently their vorticity is not sourced . on the other hand , defects have non - zero anisotropic stress , which induces vorticity in the defects and vector perturbations in the metric . however , we show that the vector modes in the defects and the metric form a closed system of conserved quantities and do not couple to the vorticity in the fluids .",
    "previous analyses have considered the possibility of harrison magnetogenesis via vorticity from cosmic defects  @xcite .",
    "the argument relies on breaking the perfect fluid condition , and/or on nonlinear effects in the defect evolution . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors argue that for fluid particles that pass near enough to cosmic strings , shock fronts form in the fluid .",
    "the shock causes a discontinuity in the entropy of the fluid , and leads to turbulence and vorticity , and in turn to magnetic fields through a harrison - type mechanism @xcite .",
    "this effect , which is confined to the wakes after recombination and due to highly non - linear dynamics , is completely absent in our analysis , which restricts to linear theory and deals with perfect matter fluids with constant entropy .",
    "subsequently it was proposed that magnetic fields can be generated also prior to recombination , around matter - radiation equality , via nonlinear dynamical friction of the surrounding particles on the motion of two wiggly strings moving in opposite directions  @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is argued that it is the rotating string loops rather than the long straight strings which dominate the generation of vorticity on the relevant scales .    in the next section we review the harrison mechanism in first - order perturbation theory , and derive the collision rates for coulomb and thomson scattering . in section  [ sec :",
    "basics ] , we present the necessary defect equations and then show that vorticity is not induced in the fluids if they do not have anisotropic stresses and do not interact other than gravitationally with the defects .    we consider a flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) background .",
