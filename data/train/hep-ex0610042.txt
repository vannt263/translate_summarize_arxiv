    "last year has been full of new results in the kaon physics , which continues to contribute to the development and the understanding of the standard model ( sm ) flavor structure . given the plenty of experimental results , only a part of these ones will be described in this review . in the first two sections ,",
    "the na48/2 results on @xmath2 decays will be presented : section  [ sec : cp_kpm ] is devoted to the search for direct cp violation in @xmath3 decays ( @xmath4 )  @xcite@xcite , while section  [ sec : cusp ] describes the measurement of the @xmath5@xmath5 scattering length extracted from the @xmath6@xmath6 invariant mass distribution of @xmath7 decays ( @xmath8 )  @xcite , a very important and unexpected by product of the cp violation analysis .",
    "the status of the determination of @xmath9  and the unitarity test of the ckm matrix is presented in section  [ sec : vus ] .",
    "section  [ sec : bs ] presents the bell - steinberger relation  @xcite which from the requirement of the unitarity offers the possibility to study the cpt invariance and to test the basic assumptions of the quantum field theories . in particular , recent results from the kloe experiment",
    "improve the determination of the cp- and cpt- violating parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the role of @xmath12 decays in probing the @xmath13-e universality emphasized by the recent na48/2 improvement on the measurement of @xmath14 ratio  @xcite , is described in section  [ sec : kl2 ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : kpnunubar ] the progress toward the study of the very rare decay @xmath1  and the prospects to make a decisive measurement of @xmath0  at the cern sps , are presented .",
    "cp violation , more than 40 years after its discovery , still plays a central role in present and future investigations of particle physics . for a long time",
    "there was no significant progress , until na48  @xcite and ktev  @xcite experiments demonstrated the existence of direct cp violation with high significance .",
    "this was done by measuring a non - zero @xmath15  parameter in the decays of neutral kaons into two pions . in 2001 ,",
    "the b - factory experiments babar  @xcite and belle  @xcite measured cp violation in the system of neutral b mesons and in 2004 also the direct cp violation in b decays has been found  @xcite@xcite .    in kaons , besides the @xmath15  parameter measured in @xmath16  into two pion decays , a promising complementary observable is the asymmetry between @xmath17 and @xmath18 decays into three pions .",
    "direct cp violation manifesting itself as an asymmetry in two cp - conjugate decay amplitude ( as in @xmath2 case ) is important as a strong qualitative test of the way in which the sm accommodates cp violation .",
    "unfortunately , in general the predicted dalitz - plot slope asymmetries are in the order of few units per million and the quantitative effort to constrain the fundamental parameters of the theory is difficult due to non - perturbative hadronic effects .",
    "an intense theoretical program is under way to improve these predictions , allowing the direct cp violation measurements to be used as strong quantitative constraints on the sm .",
    "the @xmath2 matrix element squared is usually parameterized by a polynomial expansion  @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the so called linear and quadratic dalitz - plot slope parameters ( @xmath23,@xmath24 ) and the two lorentz invariant kinematic variables @xmath25 and @xmath26 are defined as @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the pion mass , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the kaon and the pion four - momenta , the indexes @xmath31=1,2 correspond to the two identical ( `` even '' ) pions and the index @xmath31 = 3 to the pion of different charge ( the `` odd '' pion ) .",
    "if cp is conserved , the decay amplitudes must be equal for @xmath17 and for @xmath18 separately . in case of cp violation",
    ", the two different amplitudes could be studied through their asymmetry or , equivalently , by means of the asymmetry of the linear parameter @xmath20 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the slope difference and @xmath20 is the average slope .",
    "the slope asymmetry is strongly enhanced with respect to the asymmetry of the integrated decay rate  @xcite .",
    "the prediction for @xmath34 provided at first order by the chiral perturbation theory and in the framework of the sm vary from a few 10@xmath35 to a few 10@xmath36  @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations involving processes beyond the sm allow a wider range for @xmath34 which can be as high as 10@xmath37  @xcite .",
    "the na48/2 experiment in the framework of kaon physics program at the cern sps , measured the asymmetries @xmath34 and @xmath38 in @xmath3 and @xmath7 decays respectively . with",
    "1.67@xmath3910@xmath40 @xmath4 decays , the difference in the linear slope parameter of the dalitz plot for @xmath17 and @xmath18 has been measured  @xcite : @xmath41 using for the dalitz plot slope the pdg value @xmath20 = -0.2154 @xmath42 0.0035  @xcite , @xmath33 translates into the direct cp violation charge asymmetry : @xmath43    regarding @xmath7 decays , 4.7@xmath3910@xmath44 events have been used to measure the slope difference  @xcite : @xmath45 the corresponding asymmetry is found to be @xmath46 for both measurements the uncertainty due to the trigger is statistical in nature , and the global precision obtained is limited mainly by the available statistics . on the systematics side , a careful control of detector and beam line asymmetries has been done to avoid such effects fake the charge asymmetry .",
    "the results have more than one order of magnitude better precision than the previous measurements , and are compatible with the sm predictions .",
    "these measurements have been obtained using the 2003 data sample .",
    "analysis of the 2004 data will double the sample and will improve accordingly the uncertainties .",

    "the quantity @xmath54 is one of the few non - perturbative parameters which can be predicted with excellent accuracy from first principles .",
    "recent calculations  @xcite lead to a theoretical prediction of @xmath55 which has a precision not yet reached by the experiments .",
    "the best direct information on @xmath5@xmath5 scattering lengths is the one extracted from @xmath56 decays by the bnl - e865 experiment  @xcite , which is affected by a statistical error of 6% , due to the intrinsic statistical limitation of the @xmath56 decays with respect to the dominant @xmath57 modes ; moreover the bnl and na48/2 determinations of @xmath54 are affected by different theoretical and systematic errors .",
    "fitting the @xmath58 distribution excluding re - scattering effects gives a @xmath59 = 13  574 for 148 degrees of freedom .",
    "a best fit to a re - scattering model gives a good @xmath59 of 141 for 139 degrees of freedom , and provides a precise determination of the @xmath54 value : @xmath60 , with additional external uncertainty of @xmath61 from branching ratio and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "if the correlation between @xmath62 and @xmath63 predicted by chiral symmetry is taken into account , this result becomes @xmath64 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cusp_colangelo ] from  @xcite , shows a summary of different theoretical determinations of the s - wave scattering lengths , compared with present experimental measurements from na48/2 , cern dirac and bnl e865 ; the na48/2 @xmath54 determination has an uncertainty comparable with the two others available measurements .",

    "the realization that a precise test of ckm unitarity can be obtained from the first - row constraint @xmath68 ( with @xmath69 negligible ) has sparked a new interest in good measurements of quantities related to @xmath70 .",
    "as we discuss in the following sections , @xmath70 can be determined using semileptonic kaon decays ; the experimental inputs are the br s , lifetimes , and form - factor slopes . both neutral ( @xmath71  or @xmath72 ) and charged kaons may be used and provide independent measurements .",

    "<S> at present , the main topics addressed by kaon physics are the unitarity test of ckm matrix via precision measurements of the cabibbo angle as well as precision tests of discrete symmetries : in particular , study of possible cpt violations in a model - independent way through the bell - steinberger relation , or through the measurement of charge asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> other interesting topics are related to the test of predictions from chiral perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> also status and prospects of the @xmath0  and @xmath1  decays are discussed . </S>"
