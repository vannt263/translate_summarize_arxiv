    "one of the exciting results in forward rapidity ( deuteron side ) at rhic is the observation of suppression of particle yields at and below intermediate @xmath1  @xcite in d+au collisions .",
    "the observations  @xcite are consistent with the qualitative derivation from the theory of color glass condensate ( * cgc * ) .",
    "lively discussions had been ongoing about whether models with conventional stopping and/or shadowing can explain the effects  @xcite .",
    "conclusive evidences may have to wait for more quantitative predictions from theory and experimental observations of more universal scalings related to the unique physical quantity of saturation momentum scale ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "phobos collaboration has measured the charged particle multiplicity distributions in the full pseudo - rapidity ( @xmath3 ) range in p+p collisions and several centralities of the d+au and au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "brahms , phenix and star collaborations have presented results in various @xmath4 coverage as well .",
    "the results appear to be consistent with hijing / ampt models , limiting fragmentation and in disagreement with an earlier prediction by saturation models  @xcite .",
    "updated predictions from saturation model agree better with the experimental results in the d+au centrality dependence  @xcite .",
    "brahms presented the identified particle yield as function of rapidity and transverse momentum  @xcite . from the produced particle yields and net baryon rapidity loss",
    ", it was concluded that projectile au nuclei lose @xmath5 tev in the central au+au collisions .",
    "this is about 75% of the beam energy .",
    "the rapidity loss is also a relevant factor in the interpretation of the suppression in the forward rapidity .",
    "the @xmath6 rapidity distribution is gaussian with width of @xmath7 and consistent with simple estimate from landau hydrodynamics .",
    "the anisotropic flow @xmath8 as function of @xmath4 measured by phobos collaboration also shows that it is quite gaussian .",
    "these are very convincing evidences that the rapidity distribution of the particles ( @xmath9energy ) and its subsequent expansion is not bjorken boost invariance .",
    "there was debate at the conference about the validation of the models with bjorken boost invariance at the limit rapidity range ( i.e. @xmath10 ) .",
    "the statistical model has been able to describe the yield ratios of the identified particles successfully  @xcite .",
    "the question is what it means since the same model can fit well to those in p+p and aa collisions  @xcite . to distinguish a thermal system from a system born with the thermal phase space where temperature is simply a lagrange multiplier  @xcite",
    ", we need to measure the interactions between particles and observe the evolution of the system from canonical to grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the interaction of particles was measured through resonance yields according to their hadronic re - scattering cross section and collective flow of many identified particles .",
    "the evolution of the system from canonical to grand canonical ensemble was observed by the centrality dependence of the canonical suppression of strangeness in small systems .     and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",

    "[ fig : ratios](left portion ) shows the variety of the stable particle ratios in p+p and central au+au collisions at @xmath14 gev .",

    "the red ( light blue ) bars correspond to statistical model fit to @xmath15 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) in au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "i list a few observations :    * the statistical model  @xcite fit to @xmath15 and @xmath11 results in @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and strangeness saturation factor @xmath19 . * strange particles",
    "are enhanced in au+au over p+p collisions  @xcite .",
    "this is also evident from the strangeness enhancement factor as function of centrality  @xcite .",
    "* the fit to @xmath20 can not constrain the strangeness parameters to predict well the multistrangeness particle production . *",
    "the @xmath21 ratio from phenix is 40% lower than that from star due to different weak - decay feed - down correction .",
    "star measures inclusive @xmath22 production with pdg definition  @xcite ( p226 `` the rates given include decay products from resonances with @xmath23 cm '' ) .",
    "phenix s measurements are weak - decay feed - down corrected with @xmath24 from measurements and @xmath25 from model  @xcite .    the centrality dependence of @xmath26 where @xmath27 is either @xmath28 or @xmath11 increases monotonically and shows no sign of saturation . however , the charged particle density which is more propotional to the volume of the system does nt scale linearly with @xmath29 from p+p to central au+au collisions .",
    "it was noticed that the @xmath24 yield scales linearly with the charged particle density in au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "the discussion at the conference was centered at the questions of whether the number of participants @xmath29 is the right reference as a volume indicator and whether the system reaches grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the fact that the strangeness saturation factor is consistent with unity  @xcite suggests that the grand canonical ensemble is reached at least in the central collisions .",

    "[ fig : ratios ] are the ratios of resonance yields over stable particle yields",
    ". the resonances are @xmath30 with ratios of @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "these ratios were also shown to have different centrality dependence  @xcite .",
    "when compared to statistical model predictions from fitting results of stable particles , the ratios of @xmath33 and @xmath32 in central au+au collisions are low . at the same time , the @xmath34 ratio is very close to the prediction and independent of centrality while @xmath35 ratio is a little higher than but within the error of the prediction .",
    "we reached same conclusion by comparing the results from au+au to those from p+p collisions .",
    "this indicates that the peculiar feature is model - independent .",
    "a natural explanation to these behaviors will be the re - scattering and regeneration of resonances via hadronic interactions .",
    "the system in the hadronic phase is effectively a pion gas .",
    "resonances with short lifetime ( @xmath36 fm ) will decay in an environment surrounding by pions .",
    "the daughters from these decays will re - scatter with pions and other particles . on the other hand",
    ", the hadrons will interact to generate the resonances through the reverse reaction channel of the decay . in the case of @xmath37 ,",
    "the reaction channel will be @xmath38 and the re - scattering channel is @xmath39 . since the @xmath40 cross section is large ( @xmath41 )",
    ", it is a good assumption that the daughter pions from @xmath37 decay before kinetic freeze - out will not escape the system .",
    "therefore , we will not be able to observe those @xmath37 decay in the hadron gas before kinetic freeze - out .",
    "the reaction channels of @xmath42 , @xmath43,@xmath44 , and @xmath45 and their daughter rescatterings have very different cross seection and the yield ratios of @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are consistent with the cross sections .",
    "we conclude :    * interactions between particles happen in the system .",
    "temperature from the thermal fit is unlikely to be just a lagrange multiplier  @xcite . *",
    "the balances of resonance re - scattering and re - generation are not maintained in the course of the expansion .",
    "the resonance yields reflect the time span of the expansion  @xcite .",
    "* interactions happen with finite cross section comparable to the cross section measured and implemented in transport models  @xcite .",
    "* it is too idealized to assume infinite cross section in hydrodynamics all the way to the kinetic freeze - out .",
    "* it is too idealized to assume that the same chemical equilibrium in the resonance yields at the chemical freeze - out can be maintained up to the kinetic freeze - out .",
    "the identified particle spectra have been used to extract information about radial flow and kinetic freeze - out .",
    "the main focus is on the issue of whether there is a single freeze - out and if not , are the particles with different hadronic scattering cross sections decoupling at different time ?",
    "detailed discussions have been presented  @xcite with comparisons / fits of models of hydrodynamics or hydro - inspired blast wave to the measured identified particle spectra .",
    "although some of the results indicated that hydrodynamics with one single freeze - out describes the spectra well , the others showed that sequential freeze - out of different particles is needed to fit the data .",
    "the discussions raised to the level of whether we are `` abusing '' ( relying too much on , over - interpreting ) the model comparisons  @xcite .",
    "however , the sequential freeze - out is more consistent with the rescattering of resonance discussed in previous section .",
    "[ fig : pbar ] showed the @xmath22 spectra from p+p , d+au and au+au collisions by the four rhic experiments  @xcite .",
    "the plot shows that from p+p to all centralities in au+au collisions , the @xmath22 spectra exhibit binary scaling at @xmath46 gev / c .",
    "the centrality difference is prominent at low @xmath1 where the spectrum is flatter from p+p to central au+au collisions .",
    "brahms showed that there is very little centrality dependence in the spectral shape  @xcite , therefore centrality dependence of radial flow is not as dramatic .",
    "however , this depends on the @xmath1 and centrality coverage .",
    "the feature of low yield at low @xmath1 and binary scaling at high @xmath1 is counter - intuitive to the radial flow effect since one would have expected the yields at high @xmath1 to increase from peripheral to central due to the flow push of low @xmath1 protons to higher @xmath1 .",
    "this also shows that the spectrum at @xmath46 gev / c is not sensitive to the flow effect and probably should not be included in the simple blast wave fit or hydrodynamic model comparison .    suppression of high @xmath1 hadron production has been observed at rhic in central au+au collisions relative to p+p collisions .",
    "this suppression has been interpreted as energy loss of the energetic partons traversing the produced hot and dense meduim . at intermediate @xmath1 , the degree of suppression",
    "depends on particle species .",
    "surprisingly , at the range of @xmath47 gev / c the baryons appear to scale approximately with number of binary collisions in au+au collisions relative to p+p collisions while the mesons are greatly suppressed .",
    "the new data presented in this conference tried to address the following questions :    * whether the effect is a baryon - meson or a mass effect .",
    "this was achieved by comparing the nuclear modification factors of baryons ( @xmath48 ) , light mesons ( @xmath49 ) to heavy mesons ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "* whether the effect is a final state or initial state effect .",
    "this was achieved by comparing the nuclear modification factors of different particle species in au+au to d+au collisions .",

    "[ fig : rcp ] shows the @xmath52 ( central / peripheral ) of @xmath51 and @xmath11 presented by star and phenix collaborations .",
    "although higher statistics are necesary for particles , such as @xmath53 and @xmath11 , it is quite convincing that the @xmath52 exhibits a baryon - meson effect from the comparison .",
    "one of the highlights in this conference is the successful explanation of @xmath8 scaling and this intriguing result from coalescence / recombination at the quark level  @xcite .",
    "nuclear modification factors in d+au ( @xmath54 )  @xcite have been presented in the conference and publications as well  @xcite .",
    "it showed that the proton ( @xmath24 ) @xmath54 at the intermediate @xmath1 is larger than unity as also evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : pbar ] .",
    "this contrasts to the binary scaling in au+au collisions .",
    "the difference between @xmath54 of pions and protons is about 20% while @xmath55 are different by a factor of @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "it was concluded that the particle dependence of the suppression observed in au+au collisions is also a final state effect .",
    "the good candidate mechanism is the coalescence / recombination at the quark level  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic flows measure the asymmetry of particle density in momentum space relative to the reaction plane .",
    "the geometry is initially asymmetric in non - central aa collisions .",
    "the transformation from geometric asymmetry to momentum - space asymmetry requires strong interactions at early stage where the geometry has not been blurred by the expansion .",
    "anisotropic flow is one of the key achievements of the rhic bulk program where good agreement between measured @xmath8 and ideal hydrodynamical calculations was reached  @xcite .",
    "the conference witness beautiful set of data including :    * higher harmonics : @xmath57  @xcite . *",
    "different particle species : @xmath58  @xcite . * large coverage in rapidity and centrality : @xmath3  @xcite . * non - flow , cumulant , and newer techniques  @xcite .",
    "we saw a set of @xmath8 measurements with not only @xmath59 but also multistrange particles @xmath60 and @xmath11 .",
    "more importantly , the measured @xmath8 values as function of @xmath1 scale with the number of constituent quarks as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v2 ] .",
    "this indicates that the number of the constituent quarks in a hadron is a relevant degree of freedom as in the case of nuclear modification function  @xcite .",
    "in addition , hadrons with strange quarks behave the same as other particles .",
    "it has been argued that @xmath11 flow will be a signature of partonic collectivity  @xcite .",

    ", hadrons interact according to the hadron - hadron cross section as observed from resonances .",
    "keep in mind that all the @xmath11 excited states do not decay back to @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , any violent interactions need to drive the @xmath11 flow at hadron stage will result in disappearance of @xmath11 .",

    "how can we use the jet quenching to study the thermalization of the system ?",
    "+ one of the highlights at this conference is the experimental capability of reconstructing the soft particle spectra from a jet traversing a medium in au+au collisions at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the spectral multiplicities and total scalar @xmath1 in both near - side and away - side increase with centrality ( toward central ) accompanying the disappearance of back - to - back correlation at higher @xmath1 of the associated particles .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the away - side spectrum becomes softer from p+p toward central au+au collisions while the bulk spectrum becomes harder .",
    "we can roughly estimate the thermalized fraction of away - side jet from the at central au+au collisions by @xmath65@xmath66@xmath67 .",
    "similar to what discussed in previous section , if the chemical composition ( e.g. strangeness content ) of the away - side soft spectra changes from canonical ensemble in p+p collisions to grand canonical ensemble in central au+au collisions , this will be a strong signature that the jet probe `` melts '' and becomes part of the thermalized system .",
    "one should look forward to this at qm05 .",
    "forward - backward rapidity asymmetry in d+au . + it is still an ongoing research on whether the cronin effect seen in d+au collisions can be explained by final state effect as well  @xcite .",

    "+ it will be very important / interesting to see whether some of the key phenomena have any energy dependence .",

    "thermal / statistical model describes well the stable particle yields up to @xmath11 at mid - rapidity in central au+au collisions .",
    "the radial flow derived from the identified particle spectra and the finite hadronic scattering cross section from the resonance yields indicate that the chemical freeze - out is followed by a kinetic freeze - out .",
    "it is clear that the measurements of nuclear modification function and anisotropic flow ( @xmath8 ) of the identified particles support parton coalescence / recombination for particle production at the intermediate @xmath1 .",
    "the strong anisotropic flows of identified particles up to @xmath11 together with the observation of finite hadronic cross section from resonances are a strong indication of partonic collectivity . in the near future",
