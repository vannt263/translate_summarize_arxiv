    "in the past years the bose - hubbard model @xcite has been extensively investigated and a lot of interest has been generated thanks to ultracold atom experiments on optical lattices @xcite , which provide an ideal realization of the model .",
    "recently , much theoretical and experimental work has been performed on mixtures with several species of particles .",
    "for instance , bose - fermi mixtures on lattices have been studied @xcite .",
    "another mixture that is likely of interest involves atoms and molecules , in which conversion between the two species is possible .",
    "such conversion processes can describe , for instance , long - lived bound states of atoms ( diatomic molecules ) occuring in ultracold atom experiments where a feshbach resonance is used to tune the scattering length of the atoms @xcite . in those experiments , the hyperfine interaction between two spin polarized atoms can flip the spin of one of the atoms , reducing sensitively their scattering length .",
    "the two atoms are virtualy bound into a `` molecular '' state until the hyperfine interaction flips again the spin of one of the atoms .",
    "with the motivation above , we propose to study a two - boson species model with an additional conversion term allowing two particles from the first species to turn into one particle of the second species , and vice - versa .",
    "we denote the first species as `` atoms '' , and the second species as ( diatomic ) `` molecules '' .",
    "atoms and molecules can hop onto neighboring sites , interact , and conversion between two atoms and a molecule can occur .",
    "several atoms can reside on the same site , their interaction being described by an on - site repulsion potential . a second on - site",
    "repulsion potential describes the interactions between molecules and atoms being on the same site .",
    "this leads us to consider the following hamiltonian @xmath0 with @xmath1    the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 operators correspond respectively to the kinetic , potential , and conversion energies .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath6 operators ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) are the creation and annihilation operators of atoms ( molecules ) on site @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 counts the number of atoms ( molecules ) on site @xmath9 .",
    "those operators satisfy the usual bosonic commutation rules @xmath12=\\delta_{ij}$ ] and @xmath13=\\delta_{ij}$ ] . in order to simplify the model and reduce the space of parameters , we impose a hard - core constraint on molecules .",
    "this is done by adding the condition . for a minimal model",
    ", we set a maximum of two atoms per site by imposing .",
    "the sums @xmath14 run over pairs of nearest - neighboring sites @xmath9 and @xmath15 .",
    "we restrict our study to one dimension and we choose the atomic hopping parameter @xmath16 in order to set the energy scale , while we choose the molecular hopping parameter @xmath17 , motivated by the continuous - space behavior of the hopping as a function of the mass ( @xmath18 ) , a molecule being twice heavier than an atom .",
    "smaller values of @xmath19 ( as mapping of experimental systems to bose - hubbard models would suggest @xcite ) are not expected to lead to qualitatively different behavior .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 controls the interaction strength between atoms , and @xmath21 controls the interaction between atoms and molecules .",
    "the conversion between atoms and molecules is controlled by the positive parameter @xmath22 .",
    "this parameter can be related to the `` hyperfine interaction '' parameter in the feshbach resonance picture @xcite .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath23 acts as a chemical potential for molecules , and allows to tune the energy difference between atomic and molecular states .",
    "this parameter can be related to the `` detuning '' in the feshbach resonance example . in the remainder of the paper we will not expand on the connection to the feshbach resonance problem , nor attempt to reproduce feshbach resonance physics .",
    "we concentrate on taking the model given in ( [ hamiltonian])([conversion ] ) at face value and determining its phase diagram .",
    "a similar model for the one - dimensional continuum has been analysed in ref @xcite , and for optical lattices in the mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the hamitonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) does not conserve the number of atoms @xmath24 , nor the number of molecules @xmath25 , because of the conversion term ( [ conversion ] ) .",
    "however we consider that a molecule is made of two particles , so the total number of particles @xmath26 in the system is conserved : @xmath27",
    "in order to make the model suitable for simulations , we perform a mapping of the hamiltonian describing two species of bosons on a 1d lattice ( [ hamiltonian ] ) onto a hamiltonian describing single species of bosons evolving on a ladder ( fig .",
    "[ mapping ] ) . in the 1d space ,",
    "the two species live together .",
    "they can hop onto neighboring sites , and the interaction between the two species is described by an on - site potential @xmath21 .",
    "the conversion between the two species occurs on a single site . in the ladder space ,",
    "the atoms ( molecules ) live on the top ( bottom ) side of the ladder .",
    "the interaction between the two species is described by a potential @xmath21 acting between vertical neighboring sites .",
    "two atoms living on the same atomic site can be destroyed at the same time , with the creation of a molecule on the corresponding molecular site ( and vice - versa ) .",
    "quantum monte carlo simulations are performed for the ladder model by making use of the world line algorithm @xcite .",
    "it is essential to emphasize that this algorithm works in the canonical ensemble , meaning here that the total number of particles @xmath28 is conserved .",
    "indeed , simulations using a grand canonical algorithm ( stochastic series expansion ) @xcite turned out to be difficult to handle , because it is numerically very hard to control the number of particles of each species using two chemical potentials , the number of particles of each species depending on both chemical potentials .    defining the continuous product of evolution operators in imaginary time , @xmath29",
    "one starts by writing the partition function as the trace of the evolution operator @xmath30 @xmath31 using the occupation number representation for the states @xmath32 .",
    "then we use the so - called `` checkerboard decomposition '' for the hamiltonian , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are defined by @xmath37 \\\\    \\nonumber           & + & u_{am}\\big(\\hat n_i^a \\hat n_i^m+\\hat n_{i+1}^a \\hat n_{i+1}^m\\big ) \\\\",

    "the energy of the model is independent of the sign in ( [ sign ] ) , so ( [ sign ] ) and ( [ conversion ] ) are equivalent .",
    "this can be seen by realizing that flipping the sign of the conversion term just results in a redefinition of the phase of the molecular creation and annihilation operators , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we work with a minus sign in ( [ sign ] ) in order to ensure that all matrix elements @xmath40 are positive . those positive matrix elements normalized by @xmath41 define the probability of transition from the state @xmath42 to the state @xmath43 , which is required for a monte carlo sampling .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath44 and @xmath45 are written each as a sum of operators @xmath46 that commute ( but @xmath44 and @xmath45 do not commute ) . using the trotter - suzuki formula at second order , @xmath47 and using properties of the trace",
    "we get @xmath48    the error due to the trotter - suzuki decomposition vanishes because of the continuous product making @xmath49 going to zero ( in the case of a discrete product the trotter error becomes @xmath50 instead of @xmath51 , due to the accumulation of errors in the product ) . introducing complete sets of states",

    "the size of the hilbert space of the four - site problem is 36 .",
    "thus each matrix element in ( [ partition ] ) can be computed by evaluating numerically @xmath61 matrices . as a result",
    ", the quantum problem has been mapped onto a classical problem with an extra imaginary time dimension , and the algorithm consists in generating configurations of states @xmath54 using standard classical monte carlo techniques . for more details , see references @xcite .",
    "in addition to the atomic and molecular densities , @xmath62 we also define the total density @xmath63 by analogy with ( [ totalnumber ] ) , where @xmath64 is the number of sites in the lattice .    in order to identify insulating phases , it is useful to look at the behavior of the total density @xmath65 as a function of the chemical potential @xmath66",
    ". it is common to define the chemical potential in the canonical ensemble at zero temperature by the energy cost to add one particle to the system , .",
    "however , for our present model , it is better to define it by the energy cost to add successively 2 particles to the system divided by 2 , @xmath67 indeed , this allows to keep an even total number of particles , preventing an extra single particle to be out of the atoms / molecules conversion process .",
    "another quantity of interest for the characterization of a phase is the superfluid density .",
    "an easy way to access this quantity is to make use of pollock and ceperley s formula @xcite that relates the superfluid density to the fluctuations of the winding number @xmath68 , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the hopping of the considered species , @xmath71 the inverse temperature , and @xmath64 the number of lattice sites .",
    "usually , this winding number @xmath68 is perfectly well - defined for systems with @xmath72 species of particles . for a given configuration",
    ", it is defined by the number of times that the world lines cross the boundaries of the system from the left to the right , minus the number of times they cross the boundaries from the right to the left ( fig .  [ mixturewinding]a ) .",
    "but in our case , the atomic and molecular windings , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , are ill - defined because the world lines associated to each of the species may be discontinous if conversions between atoms and molecules occur ( fig .",
    "[ mixturewinding]b ) .",
    "it is then no longer possible to determine whether a particle is flowing to the right or to the left as a function of imaginary time .",
    "however we can define atomic and molecular pseudo - windings , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , by the number of right jumps minus the number of left jumps , normalized by the number of sites @xmath64 .",
    "non - zero values of such pseudo - windings are signatures of superfluidity of the particles . when no conversion between atoms and molecules occurs , the definition of pseudo - winding coincides with that of true winding .",
    "in addition , the _ correlated _ winding is well - defined for the mixture of particles , @xmath77 because the composite atomic and molecular world lines are continuous ( if one considers that a molecular world line represents two atomic world lines ) .",
    "this correlated winding is relevant for the superfluid density of the mixture because it corresponds to the winding of particles , without looking at their individual nature ( atom or molecule ) .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the _ anti - correlated _ winding , @xmath78 which allows to determine if atoms and molecules are flowing in opposite directions or not .",
    "the definitions of correlated winding ( [ correlatedwinding ] ) and anti - correlated winding ( [ anticorrelatedwinding ] ) are similar to those used in bose - fermi mixtures @xcite .",
    "it is useful to start the investigation of the model by considering first the one - site problem with a total number of particles @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "figure [ rhovsg1 ] shows the atomic and molecular densities as functions of the conversion parameter @xmath22 and different values of the detuning @xmath23 for @xmath81 ( the value of @xmath21 does not play any role since there is only 2 atoms or 1 molecule ) . for @xmath82 and small @xmath22 , the 2 particles are mainly bound in the molecular state , because the creation of the molecule has a vanishing energy cost while having 2 atoms costs @xmath83 . as @xmath22 increases",

    "when @xmath22 is large , the system maximizes the conversion process .",

    "the transition point between those two cases is @xmath86 for which the atomic state has exactly the same energy as the molecular state .",
    "those states have the same probability , and varying @xmath22 just changes the rate of conversion between them .",

    "<S> we investigate the phase diagram of a two - species bose - hubbard model including a conversion term , by which two particles from the first species can be converted into one particle of the second species , and vice - versa . </S>",
    "<S> the model can be related to ultracold atom experiments in which a feshbach resonance produces long - lived bound states viewed as diatomic molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the model is solved exactly by means of quantum monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that an `` inversion of population '' occurs , depending on the parameters , where the second species becomes more numerous than the first species . </S>",
    "<S> the model also exhibits an exotic incompressible `` super - mott '' phase where the particles from both species can flow with signs of superfluidity , but without global supercurrent . </S>",
    "<S> we present two phase diagrams , one in the ( chemical potential , conversion)-plane , the other in the ( chemical potential , detuning)-plane . </S>"
