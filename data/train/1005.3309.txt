    "<S> we consider the embedding of the supersymmetric standard model with broken r  parity in the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model . we restrict ourselves to the case of broken lepton number , the b@xmath0 msugra model . </S>",
    "<S> we first study in detail how the tree  level neutrino mass depends on the msugra parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find in particular a strong dependence on the trilinear supersymmetry breaking @xmath1parameter , even in the vicinity of the msugra sps1a point . </S>",
    "<S> we then reinvestigate the bounds on the trilinear r - parity violating couplings at the unification scale from the low  energy neutrino masses including dominant one  loop contributions . </S>",
    "<S> these bounds were previously shown to be very strict , as low as @xmath2 for sps1a . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these bounds are significantly weakened when considering the full msugra parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the ratio between the tree  level and 1loop neutrino masses is reduced such that it may agree with the observed neutrino mass hierarchy . </S>",
