    "we study deconvolution problem for two cases . the first variant is to estimate one of the multiplicative convolution components when another component is known .",
    "the convolution itself is observable , and unknown component is concentrated at finite number of points .",
    "the second variant concerns the case of additive convolution .",
    "let us explain our problem and method on one simple example .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is a random variable having standard normal distribution .",
    "let @xmath1 be a random variable , independent of @xmath0 and taking @xmath2 unknown positive values @xmath3 with probabilities @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the number @xmath2 is supposed to be fixed , but unknown .",
    "denote @xmath6 , and suppose that we have @xmath7 observations of @xmath8 , that is @xmath7 independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) with @xmath8 random variables @xmath9 .",
    "our aim is to estimate the number @xmath2 and the parameters @xmath10 on the base of observations @xmath11 .",
    "it is possible to interpret the distribution of @xmath8 as normal laws scale mixture .",
    "each normal distribution with variance @xmath12 may be considered as a cluster .",
    "the number of clusters is @xmath2 , and the weight of @xmath13th cluster is @xmath14 .",
    "we have to estimate numbers @xmath2 and @xmath14 , ( @xmath5 ) . in view of independence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "the moments @xmath15 , ( @xmath16 ) are products of corresponding moments @xmath17 and @xmath18 : @xmath19 because the distribution of @xmath0 is known , we may estimate the moments @xmath18 using empirical moments instead of @xmath20 . without loss of generality , we may change random variable @xmath1 by another variate ( denoted by @xmath1 again ) which has symmetric distribution taking the values @xmath21 with probabilities @xmath22 each , so that @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "now we may apply the theory for classical problem of moments ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the condition of positiveness of thruncated sequence of moments gives us an estimate for @xmath2 , while the parameters @xmath14 may be estimated on the base of corresponding orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the problem mentioned above may be considered as deconvolution problem .",
    "to see this it is sufficient to pass from random variables @xmath25 to logarithms of their absolute values .",
    "it allows to pass from multiplicative mixture to additive one .",
    "the problem takes now the foloowing form .",
    "it is necessary to estimate one component of its convolution with known distribution basing on observation of the convolution itself .",
    "it is so - called deconvolution problem .",
    "here we give detailed procedure of deconvolution problem for the case of scale mixtures .",
    "we use notations of section [ sec1 ] , but the distribution of @xmath0 is not supposed to be gaussian .",
    "however , we will impose some restrictions on the distribution .",
    "_ * assumption a*. the distribution of random variable @xmath0 possesses of all moments and can be recovered from them in unique way_.    _ * assumption b*. all moments of random variable @xmath0 are non - zero_.    let @xmath26 be a product of independent random variables , where the distribution of @xmath0 is known and satisfies assumptions a and b. @xmath1 is a random variable , independent of @xmath0 and taking @xmath2 unknown positive values @xmath3 with probabilities @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the number @xmath2 is supposed to be fixed , but unknown . basing on a random sample @xmath9 from the distribution of @xmath8 we have to estimate @xmath2 and @xmath27 .    _",
    "suppose that both * assumptions a and b * hold_. denote by @xmath28 , @xmath29 - empirical moments of @xmath8 .",
    "then , the value @xmath30 may be used as consistent estimator of @xmath18 . because random variable @xmath1 is concentrated in finite number @xmath2 of points ,",
    "then @xmath31 for all @xmath32 , and determinant ( [ eq2 ] ) equals to 0 for @xmath33 and , therefore , for all @xmath34 ( see , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we propose to use the following procedure for estimation of the number @xmath2 .",
    "consider determinants @xmath35 for the first value @xmath36 for which @xmath37 .",
    "this value denote by @xmath38 , and use it as an estimator for @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath39 is a consistent estimator of @xmath2 because ( [ eq1 ] ) are consistent estimators for the moments of random variable @xmath1 . in other words , @xmath40 as @xmath41 in probability .",
    "let us make some remarks about this procedure :    1",
    ".   estimators @xmath42 of @xmath18 are not moments themselves .",
    "therefore , the determinants @xmath43 are not obligated to be non - negative for all @xmath36 .",
    "2 .   if the number @xmath2 is not small , then the order of first zero determinant ( [ eq2 ] ) is @xmath44 , which is also not small , and its calculation is not simple .",
    "we need high accuracy of calculations and , therefore , high precision of moments estimation , and , consequently , large number of needed observations @xmath7 .",
    "it is known , that the accuracy of estimators of the moments of high order is rather low .",
    "therefore , we have one more argument , that the number of observations @xmath7 has to be very large for not small values of the components number @xmath2",
    ".    the problem of estimating the number of clusters is very interesting by itself , and therefore we provide simulation study of the quality of estimator @xmath45 .",
    "the problem of estimating @xmath46 will be considered later .",
    "we simulated samples of different sample size from mixtures of exponential distributions . on their basis",
    "we estimated the number @xmath2 of components in the mixtures .",
    "the results are given below .",
    "* simulation of samples from mixture of @xmath47 exponential distributions with scale parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( mean values are 1 and 3 correspondingly ) with equal weights .",
    "sample size used @xmath50 .",
    "there were 5000 simulations .",
    "the estimator @xmath51 had the following parameters : mean value @xmath52 ; median @xmath53 ; standard deviation @xmath54 ; percent of correct defined values @xmath55 .",
    "the results here seem to be rather good .",

    "we omit the exact numbers .    from all",
    "above we can see , that to make sure there exist one or two clusters , it is enough to have hundreds observations . to make sure there are three clusters we need some thousands observations . for four components",
    "there is necessarily to have hundreds of thousands or just millions of observations . the reasons for that are mentioned in 1.3 .",
    "however , there is another , more essential , reason consisting in the fact that many - components system can be often approximated rather good by three - components distributions . to see",
    "the difference between that one needs much more observations than for small - components cases . of course ,",
    "the number of observations needed for a good agreement between estimator and reality depends of the @xmath1 distribution structure .",
    "let us now return to the problem of estimating the parameters @xmath109 .",
    "define a sequence of polynomials @xmath110 where @xmath111 is defined by ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "it is clear , that ( [ eq4 ] ) gives us a consistent estimator for the following polynomial @xmath112 @xmath113 .",
    "we can not use this expression for @xmath33 because @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , we omit the multiplier @xmath115 for the case @xmath33 . put @xmath116 , so that the polynomials @xmath117 are defined for @xmath118 .",
    "we can define @xmath119 for @xmath120 and @xmath121 in a natural way . by solving equation @xmath122",
    "we find its roots @xmath123 .",
    "these values are consistent estimators for the roots @xmath124 of polynomial @xmath125 .",
    "it is known @xcite , that the roots of @xmath125 are the points of growth of the distribution of random variable @xmath1 . however , as has been mentioned above , the values @xmath42 are not moments of any distribution , and therefore determinant @xmath126 may be negative . to finish the process of estimation of the @xmath1 distribution we need to estimate the weights @xmath127 at points @xmath128 , ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "it is known ( see @xcite ) , that @xmath130 from ( [ eq7 ] ) we see that @xmath131 are consistent estimators of @xmath127 .    summarizing , we can give the complete procedure for estimating of the @xmath1 distribution under _ * assumptions a and b * _ as follows .    1 .",
    "calculate determinants ( [ eq3 ] ) until the first @xmath36 for which @xmath37 .",
    "this value denote by @xmath38 , and use it as an estimator for @xmath2 .",
    "2 .   calculate polynomials ( [ eq4 ] ) for @xmath132 and @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",
    "3 .   by solving equation ( [ eq6])find its roots @xmath123 .",
    "these roots are estimators for growth points of the @xmath1 distribution .",
    "4 .   values ( [ eq8 ] ) give us estimators for the weights of @xmath1 distribution .",
    "5 .   finally , the estimator for @xmath1 distribution is a measure , concentrated in @xmath45 points @xmath123 and giving them weights @xmath135 , ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "is it possible to avoid * assumption b * ?",
    "in general situation the answer is negative .",
    "the reason is that we can not find corresponding moments of @xmath1 in the case when @xmath0 has some moments equal to zero .",
    "however , one can still get some information on @xmath1 distribution .",
    "for example , we can change the moments of @xmath8 by its absolute moments .",
    "this will allow us to estimate consistently the distribution of its absolute value .",
    "the number of growth points for @xmath137 is not less than a half of that for @xmath1 .",
    "the points of growth them selfs for @xmath1 are concentrated at that of @xmath137 or at points symmetric to them .",
    "let us note , that for the case of @xmath137 all points of growth have to be non - negative .",
    "here we give detailed procedure of deconvolution problem for the case of location mixtures .",
    "we use notations of sections [ sec1 ] , [ sec2 ] .",
    "although the case of location mixtures may be transformed to that of scale by passing to exponents of corresponding random variables , the direct calculations appears to work better , and this is the reason for separate consideration of the location case .",
    "so , we start with consideration of the scheme @xmath138 where @xmath8 is observable random variable , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are independent random variables , the distribution of @xmath0 is known , while about that of @xmath1 distribution is known only that it is concentrate in a finite ( unknown ) number of points .",
    "we supposed that the _ * assumption a * _ holds . from ( [ eq9 ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath139 from here it is easy to obtain a formula for recurrent calculation of estimators for the moments of @xmath1 : @xmath140 the rest of procedure is the same as in section [ sec2 ] .",
