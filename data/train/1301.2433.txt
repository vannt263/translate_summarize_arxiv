    "recent observational data strongly suggest the existence of dark matter ( dm ) @xcite .",
    "one of a few remaining dm candidates compatible with the standard model ( sm ) are primordial black holes ( pbh ) @xcite .",
    "these black holes were formed in the early universe during gravitational collapse of density fluctuation .",
    "the existence of the pbh was first proposed in @xcite and their formation during inflation or phase transition in the early universe was discussed in @xcite .",
    "another type of objects that could be formed during phase transition in early universe are topological defects like cosmic strings and magnetic monopoles @xcite .",
    "if these objects really formed during evolution of the universe we should consider the possibility of interactions among them . within the framework of field theory a simple model of the system that allows the existence of magnetic monopoles may be given by yang - mills ( ym ) theory with @xmath0 gauge group .",
    "particle like solutions of einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) system describing the magnetic monopole were first constructed in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "solutions describing a black hole with magnetic monopole in this context were presented in @xcite .",
    "there was also shown in @xcite that finiteness of the black hole mass demands absence of an electric part of ym field .",
    "another important component of the early universe whose interaction with pbh we should consider is fermionic matter . to describe these interactions we use methods of field theory . as a toy model of pbh",
    "we take the aforementioned spherically symmetric ym black hole . as a representation of fermionic matter we use dirac field . using dimensional reduction and  bosonization",
    "we will analyze the influence of fermions on the considered pbh .",
    "a general form of a spherically symmetric and time independent metric is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an usual radial coordinate and @xmath3 is a standard metric on two dimensional sphere .",
    "the location of an event horizon of a black hole is given by the largest positive root of @xmath4 , which is denoted as @xmath5 .",
    "actually for analyzing fermions equations of motion it is more convenient to introduce the so - called _ tortoise _ coordinate @xmath6 .",
    "this coordinate is given by the following relation : @xmath7 our metric expressed in coordinates ( @xmath8 ) is @xmath9 where we introduce a function @xmath10 to keep in mind that now we have @xmath11 .",
    "from now on , to simplify our notation we will omit explicit writing of arguments of functions . during our computations",
    "we will use tetrad formalism .",
    "the local ortogonal tetrad is defined by the relation @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is an element of the tetrad , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are metric tensors in curved and flat spacetimes respectively .",

    "we choose weyl basis @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a unit two dimensional matrix and @xmath27 are three pauli matrices .",
    "gamma matrices in curved spacetime are given by the standard relation : @xmath28 .",
    "representing a  spinor @xmath29 as @xmath30 we may write the dirac equation as @xmath31 where operators @xmath32 are given by @xcite @xmath33 \\bar{n } \\cdot \\bar{\\tau } \\pm   \\frac { w - 1 } { 2 \\lambda c } \\bar{n } \\cdot \\bar{\\sigma } \\times \\bar{\\tau } \\ } + \\nonumber \\\\ & \\pm   \\bar{\\sigma } \\cdot \\bar{n } a^{-1}\\partial_{r _ { * } }   \\pm   \\bar{\\sigma } \\cdot \\bar{n } \\ { a^{-1 }",

    "we are mainly interested in fermions in _ s - wave _ sector , which is described by the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath35 . the action of operators @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath35 on these states may be found in @xcite .",
    "we may use this knowledge to integrate over the angles in four dimensional dirac action to obtain effective two dimensional theory in ( @xmath40 ) plane .    on the other hand , dimensional reduction of the ym action",
    "gives us the following lagrangian : @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "from now on latin letters from the beginning of alphabet will label indexes from curved two dimensional ( @xmath40 ) spacetime and those from the middle from flat spacetime .",
    "in the massles case we see from ( [ system_4d ] ) that chiralities decouple and effective two dimensional theory contains two fermionic fields connected to @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the field @xmath46 is @xmath47 where @xmath48 . in this formula",
    "@xmath49 is two dimensional spinor field connected to @xmath46 by rescaling and multiplication by appropriate @xmath50 matrices @xcite .",
    "two dimensional flat spacetime gamma matrices are given by the following relations : @xmath51 the lagrangian for the field connected to @xmath45 differs from ( [ fr-2d ] ) only by a sign of a term proportional to @xmath52 .    analyzing equations of motion for fermions in curved spacetime is a highly nontrivial and difficult task .",
    "however , in case at hand since we can express our problem in form of effective two dimensional theory we may use bosonization technique @xcite .",
    "this technique is well defined for flat spacetime two dimensional problems and  also for asymptotically flat spacetimes @xcite .",
    "the  merit of bosonization is that we express a fermionic sector of our theory in terms of complex scalar field .",
    "basic bosonization formulas in our case are given below @xmath53    after bosonization from ( [ fr-2d ] ) we obtain the following scalar lagrangian : @xmath54 from which we derive an equation of motion for @xmath55 field @xmath56 then , we derive an equation of motion for scalar field connected to the @xmath45 sector of our original fermionic theory analogically : @xmath57    equations ( [ sclar_massless_r ] ) and ( [ sclar_massless_l ] ) are highly nonlinear and we were not able to find a solution in terms of known special functions in the whole spacetime .",
    "nevertheless , we may find some useful information about their solutions by analyzing them in two asymptotic regions , namely in near horizon region and in large @xmath6 region .",
    "in the large @xmath6 region we have that @xmath58 taking this into account the equation ( [ sclar_massless_r ] ) turns into @xmath59 after dropping a term proportional to @xmath60 we get a  free wave equation @xmath61 a regular solution to this equation may be expressed as a plane wave @xmath62 where @xmath63 is an integration constant . on the other hand , in  the near horizon region",
    "we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 is surface gravity of a yang - mills black hole .",
    "the equation ( [ sclar_massless_r ] ) in this region takes the form @xmath66 because as we approach a black hole horizon @xmath67 , we may drop a term proportional to @xmath68 in the above equation . from this",
    "we see that a regular solution is again a time dependent plane wave given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is some other integration constant . on the basis of this analysis",
    "we may conclude that a regular solution to the considered scalar field equation will be time dependent . but both scalar fields represent fermionic currents and their time dependence ultimately means that fermionic fields will also be time dependent . to see how this may influence ym field we use equations of motion for electric and magnetic parts of this field in the presence of fermions . after using bosonization formulas ( [ bosonization ] )",
    "these equations read @xcite @xmath71 - 2~ |w|^2 b^{b } = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}[\\nabla^b \\phi_{r } - \\nabla^b \\phi_{l}],\\\\ & \\nabla_{a } \\nabla^{a } w - \\frac { 2 } { c^2 } w ( |w|^2 - 1 ) + 2 w b_{a}b^{a } = \\nonumber \\\\ & \\qquad i \\frac { 2 b } { c } ~ [ \\sin ( 2 \\sqrt{\\pi } \\phi_{r } ) + \\sin(2 \\sqrt{\\pi } \\phi_{l } ) ] .",
    "\\label{massless_w_phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    conclusions that stem from the above equations are the following .",
    "first , let us remind that equations ( [ sclar_massless_r ] ) and  ( [ sclar_massless_l ] ) differ only by sign in front of the term proportional to @xmath52 and we assume that initially a black hole has only magnetic charge ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "second , from equation ( [ massless_b_phi ] ) we see that in this case contributions of scalar fields cancel each other and @xmath72 is still a valid solution to ( [ massless_b_phi ] ) .",
    "third , from equation ( [ massless_w_phi ] ) we see that there is a nonzero contribution of scalar fields to magnetic part of ym field .",
    "but since these fields are time dependent so should be the resulting @xmath20 .",
    "on the other hand , through einstein equations , this results in time dependence of metric tensor elements and ultimately means that the assumption of staticity of yang - mills black hole is destroyed in the presence of massless fermions .",
    "for massive fermions we see from ( [ system_4d ] ) that chiralities are mixed up .",
    "to use bosonization in this case we need to make an additional assumption about the form of @xmath46 and  @xmath45 .",
    "we use the following ansatz : @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath49 are two dimensional spinor fields connected with @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively @xcite . having this in mind an effective two dimensional fermionic lagrangian is as follows : @xmath75 where like in massless case @xmath48 . using the same bosonization formulas as in the massless case we arrive at the following scalar lagrangian : @xmath76 the equation of motion for scalar field in this case is @xmath77 in the large @xmath6 limit , after dropping terms proportional to @xmath60",
    ", we obtain a sine - gordon equation @xmath78 for which a regular time dependent and decaying at infinity ( kink type ) solution is given by @xmath79 on the other hand , the same type of analysis like in the massless case revealed that in the near horizon limit we again have a free wave equation with a regular time dependent solution in form of a plane wave : @xmath80    now we will discuss the influence of massive fermions on a ym black hole .",
    "yang - mills equations of motion in the presence of fermions ( after bosonization ) are the following : @xmath81 - 2~ |w|^2 b^{b } = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\sqrt{\\pi } } \\nabla^b \\phi,\\\\ & \\nabla_{a } \\nabla^{a } w - \\frac { 2 } { c^2 } w ( |w|^2 - 1 ) + 2 w b_{a}b^{a } = \\nonumber \\\\ & \\qquad i \\frac { 2 b } { c } \\sin ( 2 \\sqrt{\\pi } \\phi ) .",
    "\\label{ym_massive-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from equation ( [ ym_massive-1 ] ) we see that , even if we initially set @xmath72 , fermions give a nonzero contribution to the electric part of ym field .",
    "this means that contrary to the massless case the presence of fermions leads to dyonic structure of a black hole .",
    "but as was shown in @xcite dyonic yang - mills black hole necessarily has infinite mass . on the other hand , form equation ( [ ym_massive-2 ] )",
    "we see that time dependent fermions give a nonzero contribution to the magnetic part of ym field . through einstein equations",
    "this leads to a time dependent line element and the destruction of staticity of a black hole .",
    "now we shall present a short summary of our results concerning the influence of fermions on a primordial black hole modeled by a magnetic yang - mills black hole .",
    "first we will discuss the massless case . by asymptotic",
    "analysis we find an evidence that regular solutions to equations ( [ sclar_massless_r ] ) and ( [ sclar_massless_l ] ) should be time dependent .",
    "these equations describe bosonized massless fermions and give a nonzero contribution to a magnetic part of yang - mills field . because their solutions are time dependent the resulting magnetic part of ym field will be time dependent and , through einstein equations , elements of a metric tensor will also be time dependent .    in massive case bosonized",
    "fermions are described by solutions to equation ( [ sclar_massive ] ) .",
    "the same type of analysis like in massless case also reveals the destruction of staticity of our black hole .",
    "moreover , massive fermions will lead to the formation of a dyonic black hole .",
    "but , as was shown in @xcite , the presence of an electric part of yang - mills field leads to infinite mass of the resulting black hole ."
