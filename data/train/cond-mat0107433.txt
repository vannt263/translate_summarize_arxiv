    "chemical gelation is the process of randomly introducing crosslinks between the constitutents of a ( macro- ) molecular fluid .",
    "one way to investigate the effects of the crosslinks on the fluid dynamics consists in measuring the stresses the crosslinked fluid builds up when subjected to a simple shear flow . for an incompressible , isotropic fluid one can experimentally access @xcite three independent components of the stress tensor @xmath8 : the shear stress @xmath9 and the first and second normal stress differences @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for",
    "static shear flows these give rise to three independent material functions : the shear viscosity @xmath12 and the first and second normal - stress coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 . generally speaking ,",
    "both newtonian and non - newtonian fluids possess a non - vanishing shear viscosity .",
    "but , whereas for a newtonian fluid both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are always zero , it is precisely the non - vanishing of @xmath0 that explains a number of characteristic effects known for e.g.  polymeric liquids @xcite , see also  2.3 in @xcite . on the other hand , even for non - newtonian fluids @xmath1",
    "is typically found to be very small as compared to @xmath0 , and the `` weissenberg hypothesis '' , @xmath13 , is a good approximation in these cases @xcite .",
    "it also seems that @xmath1 is not as well investigated experimentally as @xmath0 .    in the context of gelation one",
    "is particularly interested in the dependence of these stresses on the crosslink concentration @xmath14 .",
    "universal critical behaviour is expected to occur at the gelation transition , that is , at the critical concentration @xmath15 , where the fluid ( sol ) undergoes a sudden phase change into an amorphous solid state ( gel ) . as far as shear stress is concerned , there exist numerous experimental investigations on the static shear viscosity and on the time - dependent shear - stress relaxation function .",
    "the experimentally measured values for the critical exponent @xmath4 , which governs the algebraic divergence of the shear viscosity when approaching @xmath15 from the sol side , scatter considerably and are found in the range @xmath16 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the origin of this wide spreading is controversially discussed and eventually unclear . from a theoretical point of view there exists a bunch of competing and partially contradicting scaling relations which express @xmath4 in terms of percolation exponents .",
    "each of them relies on heuristic arguments whose validity is mostly unclear .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a summary and references . here we only mention the scaling relation @xmath17 which was first proposed by de  gennes @xcite and rederived by many others .",
    "erroneously , it is generally referred to as the `` rouse expression '' for the viscosity exponent . here , @xmath18 is the exponent governing the divergence of the correlation length and @xmath19 is associated to the gel fraction . for three - dimensional bond percolation one would get the value @xmath20 .",
    "recently , the viscosity was _ exactly _ determined within the rouse model for gelation in @xcite .",
    "the analysis disproves the above result and shows that @xmath21 is the true scaling relation valid for rouse dynamics . here",
    ", @xmath22 denotes the first crossover exponent of a corresponding random resistor network @xcite .",
    "when inserting @xcite high - precision data for @xmath22 and @xmath19 obtained from three - dimensional bond percolation , the true rouse value of the viscosity exponent turns out to be @xmath23 and agrees with simulations @xcite on a similar model .",
    "the discrepancy to de gennes result above can be attributed to the neglect of the _ _ multi__fractal nature of percolation clusters in @xcite . amazingly , the true rouse value @xmath24 differs only little from that of another proposal , @xmath25 , by de gennes @xcite , where he alluded to an analogy to the conductivity exponent @xmath26 of an electrical network consisting of a random mixture of superconductors and normal conductors .",
    "this close agreement , however , seems to be coincidental .",
    "in contrast , the authors are not aware of any experimental or theoretical studies concerning the dependence on the crosslink concentration @xmath14 of normal stresses near the gelation transition .",
    "this seems all the more surprising since there exist many experiments @xcite on both the shear - rate dependence of normal stresses in entangled or ( temporarily ) crosslinked polymeric liquids in order to explain shear - thinning or shear - thickening phenomena and on the time dependence of the normal - stress response to particular shapes of shear strain .",
    "theoretical explanations of these experimental findings mainly rely on the analysis of transient network models , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "even though rouse - type models incorporate no other physical interactions between monomers apart from connectivity , they serve as a standard theoretical reference in terms of which experimental data are frequently interpreted .",
    "therefore it is important to test their predictions as accurately as possible .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to use the same generalised rouse - type model as in @xcite to predict the critical behaviour of the normal - stress coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the gelation transition . within this model",
    "it will turn out that @xmath1 vanishes for all @xmath14 and that @xmath0 diverges with a critical exponent @xmath27 when approaching @xmath15 from the sol side . here",
    ", @xmath5 denotes the exponent governing the divergence of the time scale in the kohlrausch decay of the shear - stress relaxation function . for crosslinks distributed according to mean - field percolation (",
    "also called `` classical theory '' ) , this scaling relation yields @xmath6 , in a accordance with an exact expression for @xmath0 based on a replica calculation . alternatively ( and more realistically ) , using three - dimensional percolation for the crosslink ensemble we find the value @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the model predicts a much more pronounced divergence of @xmath0 as compared to @xmath12 so that @xmath0 may serve as a sensitive indicator for the gelation transition .",
    "we also derive results on the time - dependent normal - stress response .",
    "in particular , the lodge - meissner rule , see e.g.   3.4.e in @xcite , is shown to hold for normal - stress relaxation after a sudden shearing displacement .",
    "we hope that these theoretical investigations motivate corresponding experimental work in order to develop more insight on normal stresses in ( near ) critical gels .",
    "we follow a semi - microscopic approach to gelation based on a rouse - type model for @xmath29 monomers .",
    "the monomers are treated as point particles with positions @xmath30 , @xmath31 , in three - dimensional space .",
    "the motion of the monomers is constrained by @xmath32 randomly chosen , harmonic crosslinks which connect the pairs @xmath33 , @xmath34 , of monomers and give rise to the potential energy @xmath35 here , the fixed length @xmath36 models the overall inverse coupling strength , whereas the individual coupling constants @xmath37 are chosen at random . quite often ,",
    "only the special case @xmath38 has been considered previously .",
    "the second equality in ( [ poten ] ) introduces the random @xmath39-connectivity matrix , which encodes all properties of a given crosslink realisation .        following @xcite we employ a simple relaxational dynamics",
    "@xmath40 =     - \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r^{\\alpha}_i}(t )     + \\xi^{\\alpha}_i(t)\\ ] ] without inertial term to describe the motion of the monomers in the externally applied velocity field @xmath41 with a time - dependent shear rate @xmath42 , see also fig .",

    "note that we have chosen units in which the inverse temperature is equal to one .",
    "given the shear flow ( [ flowfield ] ) , the equation of motion ( [ eqmotion ] ) is linear and can be solved exactly for each realisation of the thermal noise @xcite .    to complete the description of the dynamic model",
    ", we have to specify the statistical ensemble which determines the realisations of the crosslinks .",
    "we will distinguish two cases :    1 .",
    "mean - field percolation ( also called `` classical theory '' ) : each pair of monomers is chosen independently with equal probability @xmath48 , irrespectively of the monomer positions in space . as a function of the crosslink concentration @xmath49 , the system undergoes a percolation transition at a critical concentration @xmath50 . for @xmath51",
    "there is no macroscopic cluster , and almost all clusters are trees @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional bond percolation @xcite .",
    "for either case we assume the random coupling constants @xmath37 to be distributed independently of the crosslink configuration , as well as independently of each other with the same ( smooth ) probability distribution @xmath52 . moreover , sufficiently high inverse moments @xmath53 of @xmath37 shall exist",
    ".    the combined average over crosslink configurations and random coupling constants will be denoted by an overbar @xmath54 . using this notation",
    ", we implicitly assume that the macroscopic limit @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 is carried out , too .    before turning to the analysis of the model",
    "we would like to comment on the fact that it describes the random crosslinking of single monomers rather than of pre - formed polymers .",
    "however , this does not mean that the applicability of the model is limited to the description of random networks built up by polycondensation from small structural units .",
    "indeed , we expect from universality that details at small length scales are irrelevant for the true critical behaviour at the gelation transition so that these results will also hold for random networks built from arbitrary macromolecules , as is the case in vulcanization , for example .",
    "this general universality argument was confirmed @xcite by explicit computations of the critical behaviour of the shear viscosity with the mean - field distribution of crosslinks .",
    "due to the externally applied shear flow the crosslinks exert shear stress on the polymer system , whose tensor components are given in terms of a force - position correlation @xcite @xmath58 here , @xmath59 denotes the density of monomers . in ( [ stressdef ] )",
    "one has to insert the explicitly known @xcite solutions @xmath60 of the rouse equation ( [ eqmotion ] ) at time @xmath61 with initial data @xmath62 at time @xmath63 . in order to ensure that the thermal - noise average allows for the description of a possible stationary state of the system at finite times @xmath61 , the time evolution is chosen to start in the infinite past , @xmath64 , thereby losing all transient effects which stem from the initial data",

    "the associated eigenvectors are constant within each cluster and zero outside @xcite . within the simple rouse model the zero eigenvalues do not contribute to shear relaxation because there is no force acting between different clusters .",
    "the only contribution to stress relaxation is due to deformations of the clusters .    for a time - independent shear rate",
    "@xmath72 it is customary to define a first and second normal - stress coefficient by @xmath73 one deduces immediately from ( [ stresstensor ] ) that @xmath74 a characteristic result for rouse - type models .",
    "in contrast , the first normal - stress coefficient @xmath0 is non - zero @xmath75 and independent of the shear rate @xmath76 .    for a macroscopic system @xmath0",
    "is expected to be a self - averaging quantity .",
    "therefore we will calculate the disorder average @xmath54 of ( [ psi1 ] ) over all crosslink realisations and all crosslink strengths .",

    "physically , @xmath78 describes the distribution of relaxation rates in the network ( in units of @xmath79 ) , as is evident from the representation @xmath80 of the disorder average of the stress relaxation function ( [ stressrelax ] ) .",
    "various properties of the eigenvalue density @xmath78 are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the average @xmath81 now appears as the second inverse moment of @xmath78 , @xmath82 while the disorder - averaged static shear viscosity @xmath83 is determined @xcite by the first inverse moment @xmath84    at this point one can already see that @xmath81 serves as a sensitive indicator for the gelation transition .",

    "it is the merit of the mean - field percolation ensemble that it allows for a variety of exact analytical calculations .",
    "however , since the probability for a crosslink to occur does not depend on the monomers positions in space , this ensemble is believed to provide a fairly unrealistic description for three - dimensional gels .",
    "for this reason we consider an alternative crosslink ensemble in the next section , which has been successfully used @xcite to explain static properties of polymer systems .",
    "for this ensemble of crosslinks the second inverse moment ( [ psi1av ] ) of the eigenvalue density @xmath99  note that in this section we emphasize the dependence on @xmath100 in the notation of various quantities  is not known analytically . in order to proceed we assume that @xmath99 follows a scaling law @xmath101 close to the critical point and for small enough @xmath102 .",
    "it is determined by a typical relaxation rate @xmath103 , which vanishes when approaching the critical point , and a scaling function @xmath104 that tends to a non - zero constant for @xmath105 and decays faster than any inverse polynomial for @xmath106 .",
    "in particular , this gives the power - law behaviour @xmath107 asymptotically for @xmath108 at criticality , in agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "the measured exponent values , however , scatter considerably , @xmath109 , and seem to depend on the mass of the crosslinked molecules @xcite . note that on general grounds the exponent @xmath110 has to be positive , because otherwise @xmath111 would not be integrable at @xmath112 , in contradiction to the definition ( [ dos ] ) .",

    "we will return to ( [ kohlrausch ] ) in the next section .    from ( [ psi1av ] ) , ( [ dscale ] ) and ( [ expeq ] ) we deduce @xmath121 for @xmath122 with an exponent given by the scaling relation @xmath123 since @xmath124 , we have @xmath125 and the scaling relation ( [ scalerel ] ) is compatible with the inequality ( [ jensen ] ) .",
