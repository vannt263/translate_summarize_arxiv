    "the large hadron collider opened up the possibility to scan parton densities over a wide domain of partons kinematics .",
    "this allows for detailed studies of various theoretically interesting and phenomenologically relevant dynamical effects taking place during partons evolution , such as : coherence @xcite , saturation @xcite or both @xcite . in the present work we are in particular interested in the coherence effects in the initial state gluon cascade which is modelled by ccfm  @xcite evolution equation .",
    "these effects are taken into account by summing up dominant contribution in angular ordered regions of phase space .",
    "therefore , in comparison with dglap  @xcite equation , ccfm includes some of the interference effects that are subleading from the point of view of approximation to leading - order in the ordering in the hard scales @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the transverse momentum of a t channel gluon .",
    "because of this type of ordering , the ccfm equation is applicable also in the domain of low @xmath2 and can be viewed as a bridge between low @xmath2 and large @xmath2 physics .",
    "the ccfm equation , due to the coherence effects included , provides parton distribution function ( pdf ) not only at a given fraction of proton longitudinal momentum @xmath2 and transverse momentum accumulated in the gluonic ladder , but accounts also for additional argument @xmath3 , related to the maximal angle of gluon emissions .",
    "hence , it allows for matching a pdf with a hard process matrix element given the scale of the last emission .",
    "the last feature makes it particularly interesting for extextension of the bfkl  @xcite approach .",
    "the classical ccfm equation is linear and predicts unlimited growth of parton densities at small @xmath2 .",
    "it can , however , be extended in order to account for saturation by extending it by a non - linear term  @xcite or impose absorptive boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "the ccfm equation has been already studied theoretically in some limiting cases i.e. in the low @xmath2 limit  @xcite and within monte carlo formulation  @xcite .",
    "it has been also used in phenomenological applications  @xcite . however ,",
    "the open issues concerning the ccfm are numerous to mention here just the proper form of the initial conditions , the details of violation of unitarity , the role of the soft emissions in the low @xmath2 limit .",
    "also the efficient algorithm for solving it together with evolution of quark densities is still an open problem . in the present study",
    "we reinvestigate systematically aspects of the ccfm equation using the monte carlo markov chain approach focusing on the role played by the non - sudakov form factor and the soft parts of the splitting function .",
    "the understanding of the effects coming from both parts of the splitting functions is important for investigations of unitarity violation effects in evolution of partons  @xcite since the nonlinearities affect the soft emissions .",
    "such investigation is possible since the monte carlo numerical integration we use @xcite allows for easy handling of singular integrals and therefore for taking into account effects from the full splitting function i.e. soft and hard emissions and corresponding form factors .",
    "the second reason linked to the use of markov chain monte carlo is to provide a new scheme for performing numerically efficient parton shower based on a forward evolution and extend it in the future to account for a nonlinear term allowing for saturation of gluons as well as for quarks . + the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce an iterative formulation of the ccfm equation suitable for the markov chain implementation . in section 3",
    "we present the monte carlo algorithm we apply to solve the ccfm equation using the cohrad program . in the section 3",
    "we analyze properties of the ccfm equation i.e. the effect of neglecting the sudakov form factor and soft real emissions , and we compare the ccfm to angular ordered dglap cascade .",
    "finally we perform the analysis of population of different regions of phase space focusing on the diffusion aspects of the considered equations .",
    "we use notation as in fig .",
    "[ fig : notation ] : @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote four - momenta of real and virtual gluons , respectively , and @xmath6 are fractions of longitudinal momenta of the gluon initiating the cascades .",
    "if @xmath7 , a large momentum fraction has been carried out by a real emitted gluon ( hard emission ) , while @xmath8 corresponds to a soft emission .",
    "2-vectors of transverse momenta of the emitted gluons are denoted by @xmath9 and transverse momenta accumulated on the emitting line by @xmath10 .",
    "it is also convenient to use rescaled transverse momenta @xmath11 , with their modulus being related to angles of emissions : @xmath12 .",
    "the ccfm equation imposes angular ordering in the real emissions , that can be expressed either using angles : @xmath13 or rapidities of the emitted gluons : @xmath14 .    in the following we present solution of the ccfm equation for the unintegrated gluon density in the iterative form : @xmath15 convenient for a markov chain monte carlo implementation .",
    "the @xmath16 functions impose angular ordering of emissions .",
    "the scale @xmath17 related to rapidity position of the hard process will be defined more precisely in the following .",
    "the variable @xmath18 gev plays the role of the minimal scale and the infrared cutoff on transverse momenta , @xmath19 .",
    "the initial transverse momentum of a gluon coming from a proton is denoted by @xmath20 . in the above",
    "@xmath21 is the ccfm splitting function .",
    "its form is similar to the dglap  @xcite splitting : @xmath22 yet does not include terms non - singular in @xmath23 .",
    "the non - sudakov form factor@xmath24 reads : @xmath25 the particular form of the non - sudakov form factor we study here and which allows the form factor to be larger than unity was motivated by the investigations in @xcite .",
    "this formulation which we wanted to reproduce in monte carlo neglects kinematical constraint effects and leads to fast growth of gluon density towards small values of @xmath1 .",
    "studies taking into account kinematical constraint effects we postpone for future investigations . in both @xmath26 and @xmath27 as well as in the splitting function",
    "we kept @xmath28 constant , @xmath29 , for simplicity at this stage . in the future we plan to use coupling constant as suggested by nlo bfkl results @xcite .",
    "this form factor enters the ccfm equation from resummation of virtual emissions that are harder than either of the emitting lines .",
    "it regulates @xmath23 singularity of the splitting function .",
    "a detailed discussion on the physical interpretation of the region of integration can be found for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the sudakov form factor is given by @xmath30 it can be interpreted as resummed soft virtual emissions on the emitter line . with @xmath31 being the minimal allowed transverse momentum1gev , see below for more discussion . ]",
    "the soft ( ir ) cutoff in ccfm @xmath32 is evolution scale dependent . at the beginning of the evolution ( @xmath33 ) only hard , @xmath34 , emissions are allowed . in dglap",
    "this cutoff is constant , @xmath35 .",
    "finally let us also mention that the distribution @xmath36 in eq .",
    "is related to the gluon density @xmath37 through the relation @xmath38",
    "we implemented ccfm evolution equation   in cohrad as a markov chain in @xmath39 . due to the similarities between the structures of ccfm and dglap , we applied importance sampling and generated emissions from dglap distributions that were reweighted to obtain ccfm .",
    "this is a standard monte carlo technique , that improves efficiency of generation . in the dglap evolution",
    "the sudakov form factor has been used as a probability distribution in generating each emissions and as a correcting weight for the last emission .",
    "the details of the algorithm can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the emitted particles four - momenta are constructed from @xmath40 and @xmath41 using the following : @xmath42 it can be checked that @xmath43 hence angular ordering of emissions is imposed by construction .",
    "the maximal allowed rapidity in the hard process frame is equal to 0 .",
    "its smallest value is determined by the infrared cutoff on real emissions .",
    "we set it on the minimal transverse momentum @xmath44",
    ". the rapidity of the first emitted gluon must therefore obey @xmath45 which leads to @xmath46-dependent minimum rapidity @xmath47    the splitting function used in the monte carlo is @xmath48    the non - sudakov form factor @xmath49 is included in the form of a correcting weight for a `` dglap - wise '' generated distributions .",
    "it multiplies both @xmath50 and @xmath51 poles .",
    "we present solutions of ccfm evolution equation for unintegrated gluon distributions @xmath52 .",
    "they are functions of three parameters : fractions of proton s longitudinal momentum @xmath2 , transverse momenta @xmath1 accumulated on the emitting line and the hard scale @xmath17 .",
    "the role of hard scale @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolution ] ) is to provide an upper limit for @xmath53 .",
    "let us first compare in more detail the implementations of the ccfm and dglap evolution equations , before moving to analyzing numerical results .",
    "the differences between dglap and ccfm lie first of all in the absence of non - sudakov formfactor in dglap .",
    "both evolution equations include sudakov form factor , yet differ in the definition of infrared cutoff @xmath54 , see discussion after equation  . the scale - dependent ir cutoff in ccfm suppresses the evolution into low values of @xmath2 for small scales , whereas dglap allows for emissions in that region .",
    "another important point is the definition of the hard scale @xmath17 in case of ccfm and dglap . in case of ccfm , following ref .",
    "@xcite , it is set to fixed ( @xmath2-independent ) angle , @xmath55 in terms of maximal rapidity , however , the above leads to @xmath56 , see also ref .",
    "the variable @xmath57 refers to the gluon entering the hard process . concerning the hard scale @xmath53 , in our implementation of dglap ( following ref .",
    "@xcite ) we have the hard scale set as the maximal rapidity @xmath58 and it is @xmath2-independent .",
    "that translates into maximal angles , that are @xmath2-dependent @xmath59 due to the dependence of @xmath17 on the final @xmath2 , the eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolution ] ) gets slightly modified : @xmath60 the above is easily implementable in the markovian type of mc .",
    "it is this effect that causes ccfm distribution to rapidly rise at small values of @xmath2 .",
    "it is important that for dglap the monte carlo program enables us to extract not only @xmath2 but also @xmath1 and treat the solution of the dglap evolution equation in the following numerical analysis as a function of three arguments @xmath2 , @xmath61 and @xmath17 .",
    "the initial distribution will be typically @xmath62 for both , ccfm and dglap     ( integrated over transverse momenta ) for different hard scales : @xmath63100gev ( left ) and 1000gev ( right).,title=\"fig:\",width=298,height=204 ]   ( integrated over transverse momenta ) for different hard scales : @xmath63100gev ( left ) and 1000gev ( right).,title=\"fig:\",width=298,height=204 ]    in fig .

    "the starting condition is uniform in @xmath2 in order to observe the effect of evolution itself on the distributions .",
    "it is visible that ccfm equation generates a much sharper rise in the small values of @xmath2 .",
    "this is caused by the hard scale @xmath17 in ccfm that allows the emitting more gluons , due to larger ( by @xmath65 ) allowed rapidity range than in dglap . as a result , more emissions occur , and each of them takes away more longitudinal momentum than in the case of dglap .     100 , 1000gev .",

    "in this paper we studied some of the properties of the ccfm evolution equation formulated as a markov chain parton shower model .",
    "this approach is particularly interesting since it can be generalized to a simulation for a nonlinear evolution equation , and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the purpose of the paper was to demonstrate capabilities of this method as well as to check some of the properties of ccfm which are difficult to quantify by other methods e.g. neglecting contributions on inclusive level of sudakov form factor and soft emissions at small @xmath2 . in the standard non monte carlo calculations it is a formidable task to perform a numerical calculation with both @xmath50 and @xmath51 poles included .",

    "another subject we studied concerned the comparison of the ccfm dynamics with dglap type of resummation .",
    "we observed that the ccfm equation due to angular ordering and particular condition for the maximal angle of emitted partons generates much faster growth of gluon density than dglap at small @xmath2 .",
    "finally we addressed the question how the partons generated according to ccfm and dglap equations populate the @xmath82 plane .",
    "the last study will be useful for future investigations of regions of phase space where the unitarity is violated bringing the need for suppression of growth of gluons by their recombination .",
