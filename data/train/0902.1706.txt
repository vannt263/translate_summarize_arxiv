    "since the discovery of the first fullerene , buckministerfullerene @xmath2 , fullerenes have attracted great interest in many scientific disciplines .",
    "many properties of fullerenes can be studied using mathematical tools such as graph theory and group theory .",
    "each fullerene can be represented by a 3-regular graph called the fullerene graph .",
    "its vertices are carbon atoms of the molecule ; two vertices are adjacent if there is a bond between corresponding atoms .",
    "one special feature of fullerene graphs is that they contain only pentagonal and hexagonal faces .    according to hckel molecular orbital theory ,",
    "the energy spectrum of @xmath3-electrons of the fullerene can be approximated by eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the associated fullerene graph up to a constant multiple @xcite .",
    "one of the most important information of this energy spectrum is the homo - lumo gap , which is the difference of energies between the highest occupied molecular orbit and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit .",
    "some partial results about the homo - lumo gaps of certain families of graphs are known @xcite .",
    "however , it is in general difficult to construct a molecule with the prescribed homo - lumo gap .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider a special kind of families of fullerene graphs : those with a cayley graph structure .",
    "a cayley graph @xmath4 is a graph that encodes the structure of the group @xmath5 with a generating set @xmath6 .",
    "it turns out that except for the case of @xmath2 which is a cayley graph on @xmath7 realized on the surface of a sphere , the remaining fullerene cayley graphs are toroidal provided that they are orientable .",
    "there are different techniques to construct a family of toroidal fullerenes , some are based on combinatorial methods @xcite and some on geometric approaches @xcite .",
    "a great advantage of the cayley graph structure is that all the eigenvalues can be explicitly expressed using representations of the underlying group .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "we first classify all possible structures of orientable fullerene cayley graphs and compute their spectrum . for any natural number @xmath0 not divisible by 3 ,",
    "we show that there exists an infinite family of fullerene graphs with the same homo - lumo gap of size @xmath1 .",
    "finally we discuss how to realize these families in three dimensional space .",
    "let @xmath5 be a group generated by a finite set @xmath6 .",
    "assume that @xmath6 is symmetric , namely @xmath8 .",
    "the cayley graph @xmath9 is defined as follows .",
    "vertices of @xmath10 are elements in @xmath5 and two vertices @xmath11 are adjacent if @xmath12 for some @xmath13 .",
    "the group @xmath5 acts on the graph @xmath10 by left multiplication .",
    "observe that each vertex has exact @xmath14 neighbors and we call @xmath10 an @xmath14-regular graph .",
    "@xmath9 is called a fullerene graph if it is 3-regular and it contains only pentagonal and hexagonal faces . in other words , a fullerene graph is a graph endowed with an extra structure : a set of faces enclosed by simple cycles of length five or six , and every edge is exactly shared by two faces .",
    "we shall assume that this extra structure is also preserved by the group action .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath15 @xmath16,@xmath17 is the boundary of a face for some @xmath18 , then @xmath19 is the boundary of another face for all elements @xmath20 . in other word",
    ", it is enough to study the faces containing the identity of @xmath5 and each of this face is represented by a relation @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be a face containing the identity with the boundary @xmath23 .",
    "if we choose @xmath24 as the starting vertex , such that the boundary of @xmath22 is represented by @xmath25,@xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "if we multiply @xmath29 on the left to this boundary , we get @xmath30 , @xmath31 which represents the boundary of another face containing the identity .",
    "thus , each cyclic permutation of @xmath24 @xmath26 @xmath32 represents a different face containing the identity .",
    "when @xmath10 is a fullerene graph , which is 3-regular , there are three faces containing the identity and the cyclic permutations of @xmath33 can only contain up to three different elements .",
    "we conclude that @xmath33 must be equal to one of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "write @xmath38 and regard @xmath5 as a quotient of a free group @xmath39 by three kinds of relation : the orders of generators , the relations of faces and other relations",
    ". we shall first classify the group structures of @xmath5 without other relations and any finite fullerene graph is isomorphic to a finite quotient of @xmath5 .",
    "we distinguish two cases : + case ( 1 ) : all generators have order two , say , @xmath40 .",
    "+ in this case , a relation of faces must have the form @xmath41 , @xmath42 , or their conjugations by permutating @xmath43 .",
    "note that @xmath44 and @xmath41 represents the same boundary of a face with opposite directions .",
    "consequently , there are two subcases : + case ( 1a ) : three relations of faces are @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "+ case ( 1b ) : three relations of faces are @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "+   + case ( 2 ) : at least one generator has order not equal to two , say , @xmath49 . in this case , a relation of faces must have the form @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath41 or @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , there are three subcases : + case ( 2a ) : three relations of faces are @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . + case ( 2b ) : three relations of faces are @xmath55 and @xmath44 . + case ( 2c ) : three relations of faces are @xmath56 and @xmath44 .",
    "+ we conclude that    a fullerene cayley graph @xmath4 is isomorphic to a finite quotient of one of the following five graphs described in terms of generators and relations , and @xmath6 is the image of @xmath57 under the quotient .",
    "* @xmath58 ; * @xmath59 ; * @xmath60 ; * @xmath61 ; * @xmath62 .",
    "it is not hard to prove that @xmath63 is isomorphic to @xmath64 and in this case the graph is the well - known @xmath2 .",
    "for the first four cases , @xmath10 contains only hexagonal faces .",
    "let @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath22 be the number of vertices , edges and faces of @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the euler characteristic of @xmath10 is equal to @xmath67 therefore , @xmath10 lies on a torus if it is orientable ; it lies on a klein bottle if it is non - orientable . in order to embed @xmath10 in three dimensional space",
    ", we shall assume it is orientable . in the rest of paper",
