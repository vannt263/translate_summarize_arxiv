    "high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) are characterized by large values of the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath22 , so that most of the @xmath23 phase diagram is dominated by the presence of vortices .",
    "furthermore , the high anisotropy of @xmath1 ( bi2212 ) has strong implications for the behavior of the flux lattice in the mixed state . when a magnetic field @xmath24 is applied perpendicularly to the @xmath25-planes ,",
    "the vortices can be described as two dimensional `` pancake - vortices''@xcite lying in the superconducting @xmath26 layers .",
    "these pancake - vortices interact both through the interlayer josephson coupling as well as through electromagnetic coupling .",
    "such a layered vortex structure is very sensitive to thermal and quantum fluctuations , especially considering the small coherence length @xmath27 in the direction parallel to the @xmath26 planes . as a consequence ,",
    "pinning is relatively weak as compared to classical type ii superconductors and strong relaxations of the magnetization @xmath28 are observed@xcite which deviate from a pure logarithmic time dependence .    since the discovery of the htsc@xcite ,",
    "the theoretical and experimental work concerning vortices and their dynamics have been strongly intensified .",
    "those investigations were mainly focused on a regime where the current density @xmath4 is relatively small as compared to the critical current density @xmath5 . only little",
    "is known@xcite at present regarding the vortex dynamics in a regime where the current density @xmath4 is close to @xmath5 .    in the here presented work ,",
    "we investigate experimentally the low field vortex dynamics in a bi2212 single crystal for magnetic fields @xmath29 perpendicular to the @xmath26 layers . for this purpose",
    "we have designed and constructed a dc - squid magnetometer with high sensitivity and long time thermal stability .",
    "the measurements of the relaxation of the remanent magnetization @xmath0 are taken in the temperature interval @xmath30 and cover a time window of seven decades .",
    "the wide current range of the experimental data allows a detailed analysis of the vortex dynamics within the theoretical vortex creep models.@xcite applying the method of maley _",
    "et al._@xcite to the relaxation data , a characteristic functional dependence between the activation barrier @xmath6 and the current density @xmath4 is obtained for the temperature regimes @xmath17 and @xmath18 , whereas for temperatures between @xmath20 and @xmath21 the @xmath13-relation is found to depend strongly on temperature . on the basis of a qualitative low field phase diagram@xcite of bi2212 , an interpretation of the behavior of the vortex dynamics in the temperature interval around the crossover temperature@xcite @xmath31 is given .",
    "the measured single crystal is @xmath32 in size and the critical temperature @xmath33 is 95  k , as determined by ac - susceptibility measurements .",
    "the growth procedure as well as the transport properties have been described elsewhere .",
    "@xcite the experiments are performed in a custom made dc - squid magnetometer , where the sample remains stationary in the pick - up coil during the measurements .",
    "the externally applied magnetic field @xmath24 is supplied by a superconducting coil , working in a non - persistent mode . in order to prevent eddy currents ,",
    "the experimental cell is entirely built out of epoxy resin stycast  1266.@xcite    during the measuring procedure , the sample is first zero field cooled in the residual field of the cryostat ( @xmath34 ) from well above @xmath33 and then stabilized at a fixed temperature @xmath35 .",
    "next , a magnetic field @xmath24 applied perpendicularly to the @xmath25-planes is gradually increased from zero to @xmath36 before being removed linearly at a rate of @xmath37 .",
    "this fast rate is achieved by shorting the superconducting coil ( @xmath38 ) over an extremely non - linear resistor .",
    "measurements of the current in the coil show that no discontinuities occur during the removal of the field .",
    "the data are taken as soon as the decreasing magnetic field fulfills the condition @xmath39 . as a time origin for the measured data we choose the time at which @xmath24 starts being removed .",
    "after measuring the relaxation of the remanent magnetization @xmath0 for about seven time decades , the sample is heated above @xmath33 in order to record its residual magnetization .",
    "the maximum values of the initially applied magnetic field @xmath36 are shown in table [ resfield ] for all the measuring temperatures @xmath35 .",
    "the values of @xmath36 are chosen so that they are bigger than twice the field needed to achieve full flux penetration into the sample .",
    "table [ resfield ] further contains the values of the residual field @xmath40 along the axis of the superconducting coil after cycling the magnetic field from zero to @xmath36 and back to zero again .    due to the high field removal rate @xmath41 , it was necessary to perform some controls concerning the initial field profile in the sample as well as self - heating effects .",
    "several field removal rates @xmath42 have been tested .",
    "we found that for the field removal rates @xmath43 , the measured remanent magnetizations @xmath0 do not show any remarkable difference .",
    "moreover , no significant change in the dynamics of the relaxation of @xmath0 could be detected by increasing the initial field values @xmath36 by a factor of 23 . from our estimations",
    "we concluded that the self - heating of the sample due to induction as well as to flux flow can be neglected for all temperatures and fields of our measurements .    with the described experimental procedure we measured the relaxation of the remanent magnetization @xmath0 for the bi2212 crystal from the fully critical state in a temperature range of @xmath44 .",
    "since there is only a small uncertainty of the time origin of the creep process ( @xmath45 ) , the initial behavior of the relaxation data as a function of time is very well defined so that we were able to test the existing vortex creep models over a wide current density region starting from values near @xmath5 .",
    "the main effect of pinning is to allow a flux density gradient to be sustained within a type ii superconductor .",
    "this is intrinsically related to the flow of a macroscopic diamagnetic screening current density @xmath4 that can be expressed , in the continuous approximation , through maxwell s equation @xmath46 .",
    "the configuration with a finite flux density gradient is metastable and hence is bound to decay .",
    "the dynamics arises from the vortex creep motion as a result of thermal activation@xcite and quantum tunneling@xcite ( @xmath47 ) . for a geometry where @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the maxwell equations together with the condition of flux conservation lead to the non - linear diffusion equation@xcite    @xmath50    anderson@xcite postulated that the velocity of the vortices , as a consequence of thermal activation over the pinning barrier @xmath13 , be given by    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the mean vortex velocity and",
    "can be expressed as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the mean hopping length and @xmath55 the is inverse attempt frequency .",
    "for a situation where @xmath52 is independent of @xmath4 , the diffusion equation ( [ diffeq ] ) can be transformed into    @xmath56    as discussed by geshkenbein and larkin@xcite , equation ( [ currenteq ] ) can be solved within logarithmic accuracy , yielding    [ resfield ]    .maximum applied magnetic field @xmath36 for different measuring temperatures @xmath35 and values of the residual field @xmath57 , which is due to the flux remaining trapped in the superconducting coil after the removal of the external field @xmath24 .",
    "the residual field of the cryostat is about @xmath58 in opposite direction to the applied magnetic field . [",

    ", the different @xmath7 curves tend to converge into the @xmath60 curve .",
    "further details about this temperature regime will be given in the next section .",
    "finally , for temperatures @xmath61 , the @xmath7 curves have a _ negative _ curvature in the @xmath62-@xmath63 plot , in agreement with the interpolation formula ( [ u_interpol ] ) for the barrier as obtained from the wcpt .",
    "the fitting parameter @xmath64 is again consistent with our previous results .",
    "the results obtained in the previous section for the strongly layered bi2212 single crystal in magnetic fields @xmath65-planes are now summarized and further discussed within the frame of wcpt .    for temperatures",
    "@xmath66 , the activation barrier for vortex motion @xmath13 depends logarithmically on the current density , while the time relaxation of the current density @xmath4 follows a power - law behavior as given by formula ( [ powerlaw ] ) . according to the discussion in section [ theoaspec ] , an approximately logarithmic current dependence in the activation barrier ( [ u_log ] ) is obtained within the single vortex pinning situation . however , in section [ expan ] it has been shown that for temperatures @xmath66 and small enough magnetic fields , the correlation length along the @xmath67-axis @xmath68 is much smaller than the interlayer distance @xmath69 .",
    "this indicates that for this regime pinning involves elementary pancake - vortices .    on the other hand , within the most simple approach ( see section [ theoaspec ] ) , for decreasing current densities @xmath4 the activation barrier for single pancakes @xmath13 is expected to be a constant , whereas the measured activation barrier is found to be logarithmic up to temperatures @xmath70 .",
    "the non - constant behavior of the measured activation barrier @xmath13 suggests that there are residual interactions which were not considered in the most simple approach and which lead to an increase of the elastic energy for decreasing @xmath4 .",
    "this argument is also supported by following considerations : the collective pinning energy for single pancakes,@xcite which is the relevant parameter for the determination of quantities such as the critical current density @xmath5 and the depinning energy , is given by @xmath71 .",
    "for the parameters of table [ fitpara ] and [ theopara ] one finds that @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore , the energy which is relevant for creep of pancake - vortices is expected to be bigger than @xmath73 , but of the same order of magnitude .",
    "however , this estimated energy is still small as compared to the values obtained for the activation energy @xmath13 plotted in fig .",
    "[ piculow ] , indicating that for creep of pancake - vortices additional interactions have to be considered . a possible idea leading to coupling of the pancake - vortices into an elastic plane@xcite for decreasing current densities",
    "@xmath4 is the concept of variable - range hopping . as discussed in section [ theopara ] , due to the randomness in the energies of the metastable state , pancakes will hop over larger distances as the current density @xmath4 decreases .",
    "the shear interaction energy @xmath74 will therefore grow with increasing hopping distance @xmath75 and for low enough current densities @xmath76 will become of the order of the pinning energy @xmath73 . in summary , the vortex system is expected to go over from a vrh regime ( creep of individual pancake - vortices ) to a 2d collective creep regime at low current densities .     ( the 2d regime is not shown in this plot since it is not relevant for the present data range ) .",
    "the open circles in the graph are the estimated values of the @xmath77-field at the center of the sample ( @xmath78 ) at the starting time @xmath79 , just after removing the external field @xmath24 .",
    "the vertical arrows qualitatively show the time evolution of @xmath78 during the relaxation of the remanent magnetization @xmath0 .",
    "the insert represents schematically the profiles of the induction @xmath77 in the remanent state for temperatures between @xmath20 and @xmath80 .",
    "the shaded areas indicate the different pinning regimes throughout the sample ( here @xmath81 is the sample radius ) .",
    "in particular , the parameter @xmath82 in the insert indicates the value of the induction @xmath77 in the sample at which 1d pinning goes over into 3d pinning .",
    "the smoothed irreversibility line il in the graph was obtained from the data of schilling _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ]    at higher temperatures ( @xmath83 ) , where bulk pinning becomes relatively weak , barriers arising from the geometry of the sample and from surface effects can play an important role .",
    "as shown in section [ expan ] , in the low magnetic induction regime ( `` field off '' creep measurements ) and for our specimen , these contributions are of minor importance as compared to the contributions of bulk pinning .    for temperatures @xmath18 , the activation barrier @xmath13 is found to follow a power - law behavior ( fig.[picmaley_high_temp ] ) that can be accurately fitted with formula ( [ u_interpol ] ) .",
    "within wcpt it has been shown that a potential of the form of ( [ u_interpol ] ) leads to a time relaxation of the current density @xmath4 as given by the interpolation formula ( [ j_interpol ] ) . from the fit to the @xmath84 data in fig.[picdecayfit ] , it is seen that for this temperature regime the time dependence of the current density @xmath4 is actually well described by formula ( [ j_interpol ] ) . according to wcpt , a power - law potential with an exponent @xmath16 , as obtained from the fits , indicates a regime of large bundle pinning .",
    "a list of the obtained fitting parameters is given in table [ fitpara ] .",
    "no unique functional dependence between @xmath6 and @xmath4 could be found for the temperature range @xmath85 .",
    "motivated by the present experimental results , the very low field regime of the bi2212 pinning diagram has been investigated .",
    "fig.[picpd_i ] shows the qualitative diagram obtained for this regime . for temperatures @xmath35 above @xmath86 , two different pinning regimes separated by @xmath82 are found involving vortex - pancakes and vortex - segments . in order to describe the relaxation data in this temperature regime",
    "it is therefore necessary to estimate the induction in the center of the sample ( @xmath87 ) at the time @xmath79 , immediately after removing the external field @xmath24 .",
    "these values are given for all temperatures by the empty circles in fig.[picpd ] , where the arrows indicate the time evolution of @xmath78 during the relaxation of the remanent magnetization @xmath0 .",
    "for temperatures @xmath66 and @xmath18 , it follows that the whole sample is characterized by 0d and by 3d pinning , respectively . on the other hand , as shown in the insert of fig.[picpd ] , for temperatures @xmath88 , the values of the initial field profile in the sample lead to the _ coexistence _ of two different pinning regimes : 3d pinning in the central region of the sample and 1d pinning close to the borders .",
    "the simultaneous occurrence of two different pinning regimes may then provide an explanation why no simple functional dependence between @xmath6 and @xmath4 could be found for this temperature interval .    from the analysis of the relaxation data we find that vortex bundles are strongly pinned against thermal activation .",
    "nevertheless , due to their large size they can only sustain low flux density gradients , which means low critical current densities @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "vortex strings are weakly pinned , but being small in size they can sustain relatively high flux density gradients .",
    "much higher creep rates are therefore expected for collectively pinned vortex lines than for large vortex bundles .",
    "thus , a possible interpretation of the vortex dynamics observed for the temperature interval @xmath89 is the following : the high relaxation rates which are measured at times @xmath90 ( see fig.[picmremnorm ] ) are mainly the result of the strong decay of the flux in the 1d regime at the border areas of the sample . at times",
    "@xmath91 , most of the flux has left the sample and only a low flux density gradient of vortex strings remains . as discussed in section [ theoaspec ] , at low current densities @xmath4 the activated motion of vortex - lines involves hops of larger vortex segments by longer distances .",
    "the weak relaxation rates of the current density @xmath4 measured at times @xmath92 are then explained by the growth of the elastic energy for the activated motion of vortex strings at low current densities .    a feature that has recently attracted a lot of interest in the literature is the observation of a second peak in the magnetization loop.@xcite in our bi2212 sample , as well as in several other works on bi2212,@xcite this second peak is seen for magnetic inductions @xmath77 of the order of @xmath93 and for temperatures between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "as discussed in section [ vortex lattice ] , for magnetic inductions @xmath94 the shear modulus @xmath95 starts to decrease exponentially so that , at low fields and for temperatures @xmath83 , a 1d pinning regime can arise ( see fig.[picpd_i ] ) .",
    "for the ascending branch of a magnetization loop it follows that , for fields larger than the field of first flux penetration @xmath96 , the sample is expected to first enter into the 1d regime before gradually going over into 3d . as previously discussed , at a fixed temperature @xmath35 , the value of @xmath5 is bigger for the 1d regime than for the 3d regime .",
    "however , since the flux in the 1d regime has a much faster creep rate as compared to the 3d regime , it is very important to consider the _ time scale _ for the measurement of the magnetization loop .",
    "for instance , if the time scale were very short ( @xmath97 ) , the effects of creep would be negligible and for an increasing ( decreasing ) magnetic field @xmath24 one would expect to measure a _ decrease _ ( _ increase _ ) in the magnetization as soon as the magnetic induction @xmath77 is of the order of @xmath93 , where the flux in the sample goes over from 1d to 3d .",
    "on the other hand , on the typical time scale of the measurement of a magnetization loop , the flux in the 1d regime is already strongly relaxed while the flux in the 3d regime is still close to its configuration in the critical state .",
    "the value of the magnetization @xmath28 may then turn out to be smaller in the 1d regime than in the 3d regime , leading to the characteristic double peak in the magnetization loop as measured for temperatures between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this interpretation is in agreement with previous reports ( refs .   )",
    "which relate the second peak of the magnetization loop to the slower magnetization decay for the field range where the peak is observed .",
    "moreover , it is in agreement with the results of ref .   regarding local induction measurements on a bi2212 sample .",
    "in the descending branch of the magnetization loop , at @xmath98 and for field values between @xmath99 and @xmath100 , a change of slope of the field profile @xmath101 is observed@xcite occurring at various locations inside the crystal starting from the edge regions and moving towards the center as the applied field is decreased ( with @xmath102 being the induction parallel to the crystallographic @xmath67-axis ) . within the presented low field phase diagram of bi2212 ,",
    "this change of slope is expected to occur at the crossover field @xmath82 .    in conclusion , for temperatures @xmath14 , the observation of the second peak in the magnetization loop and of the high relaxation rates of the current density @xmath4 for times @xmath103 can both be related to the coexistence of two different pinning regimes inside the sample and to the strong difference in their relaxation rates .",
