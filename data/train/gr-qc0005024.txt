    "two cosmological scenarios are currently in competition to explain the large scale ( @xmath0 ) , fairly flat , spectrum of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies which has been observed by the cobe satellite  @xcite  : inflation ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , and active seed models ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .    observations of the cmb anisotropy spectrum on smaller scales have been performed by balloon and ground experiments  @xcite , which tend to indicate the presence of a peak at @xmath1 .",
    "this peak in the spectrum gives at present the lead to the inflationary scenario .",
    "one should however be careful not to exclude too hastily active seeds at this stage . indeed , to start with , the predictions from specific topological defect models are not yet very robust , the reason being that they act as a continuous , non - linear source of inhomogeneities , and hence are difficult to model .",
    "second , there exist simple models of active seeds which `` mimic '' inflation and reproduce a peak in the spectrum on the degree scale  @xcite .",
    "third , including some microphysics in the evolution of the defect network modifies the `` standard '' picture  @xcite .",
    "even if such modellings are arguably unrealistic , they show that the absence of a peak is not the seal of all types of active seeds .",
    "it is also important to be able to predict which active seeds produce secondary peaks , like inflationary models , and which do not . as we shall see , the absence of secondary peaks is the generic signature of `` incoherent '' seeds described within the `` stiff '' approximation . more then that the presence of a sharp peak on the degree scale , the absence of secondary peaks , which will be probed by the map and planck satellite missions  @xcite ( and possibly also by the boomerang and archeops  @xcite balloon experiments ) , will toll the bell of active seeds as the main contributor to cmb anisotropies .",
    "it is clear that the ( semi-)analytic calculations of the seed stress - energy tensor correlators pioneered by durrer and collaborators  @xcite have the advantage , over heavy numerical calculations within specific topological defect models , to test the influence on the cmb anisotropies of each component of the seed stress - energy tensor .",
    "this semi - analytic approach has already allowed to grasp some generic features of the cmb anisotropies seeded by active sources ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the object of this paper is to study , within this semi - analytic approach , incoherent active seeds and show that , within the stiff approximation , they all lead to cmb spectra exhibiting no secondary peaks .",
    "the paper is organised as follows  : in  [ sec_spis ] , we first recall the some statistical properties of the seed stress - energy tensor correlators at large wavelengths [ see eq .",
    "( [ pipi324 ] ) ] , and write some up - to - now unmentionned relations [ see eqns .",
    "( [ vv12-vpi11 ] ) ] .",
    "we then give the new result that any active source described by a test scalar field must obey these properties [ see eqns .",
    "( [ pis]-[pit ] ) ] . in  [ sec_sum ] , we first recall the definition and properties [ see eq .",
    "( [ pisvt_coh ] ) ] of coherent sources ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and then explicitely construct for the first time a generic ( = incoherent ) active source as a sum of coherent ones . finally , in  [ sec_res ] , we exhibit the generic behaviour of the cmb anisotropies seeded by active sources .",
    "the stress - energy tensor of active sources is a small perturbation added to the other cosmic fluids ( this is the so - called `` stiff approximation '' ( see e.g.  @xcite ) ) .",
    "we decompose its components @xmath2 into their scalar , vector and tensor parts ( @xmath3 ) as ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the conformal time , @xmath6 are @xmath7 cartesian coordinates ; space is assumed to be flat for simplicity )  : @xmath8 barred spatial vectors are divergenceless ; barred spatial tensors are traceless and divergenceless .",
    "we work in fourier space , the fourier transform of any function @xmath9 being defined as  : @xmath10 from ( [ t00]-[tij ] ) , we therefore have  : @xmath11 and similar expressions for the other variables , with @xmath12    the ten components of @xmath13 of the active source are ten statistically spatially homogeneous and isotropic random fields .",
    "the statistical properties of those ten random fields are described by their unequal time two - point correlators @xmath14 where @xmath15 means an ensemble average on a large number of realisations , and where the correlator @xmath16 is a tensor which depends only on @xmath17 and @xmath18 because of the spatial homogeneity of the distribution .",
    "the power spectra of the fourier transforms are given by  : @xmath19 the spatial isotropy of the distribution now forces the power spectra to be of the form @xmath20 , \\\\",
    "\\label{pijkl } { \\hat{c}}_{ijkl } & = & f_0\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl}+\\bar f_0(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl}+\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk})+ f_2(k_ik_j\\delta_{kl}+k_kk_l\\delta_{ij})+ \\\\",
    "\\nonumber   & & \\bar f_2 ( k_ik_k\\delta_{jl}+k_ik_l\\delta_{jk}+k_jk_l\\delta_{ik}+k_jk_k\\delta_{il})+ f_4k_ik_jk_kk_l,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 etc are 14 real functions of @xmath5 , @xmath22 and the modulus @xmath23 of the spatial vector @xmath24 .",
    "we suppose that the active sources appeared at a definite time so that the distribution must be , for causality reasons , completely uncorrelated on scales larger than the particle horizon ( we assume a standard big - bang scenario ) . therefore ,",
    "as stressed e.g. by turok  @xcite , the unequal time correlators are strictly zero outside the intersection of the past light - cones , that is  : @xmath25 property ( [ corr_causal ] ) translates in fourier space into the fact that the equal time power spectra are white noise on super - horizon scales ( that is for @xmath26 ) . indeed , because the correlators ( [ corr_causal ] ) have compact supports , their fourier transforms are @xmath27 in @xmath24 .",
    "therefore causality forces the fourteen functions @xmath28 , @xmath29 etc to be @xmath27 in @xmath30 . moreover , since within one horizon volume there are almost no sources , those fourteen functions must tend to zero on small scales , that is for @xmath31 .",
    "when @xmath32 is decomposed into its scalar , vector and tensor components according to eqns .",
    "( [ t00]-[tij ] ) , then eqns .",
    "( [ corr_theta ] ) and ( [ p0000]-[pijkl ] ) yield @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    and similar expressions for the other correlators ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , where we have defined @xmath36 etc , and where we have introduced @xmath37    an important property of these correlators is that since ( for causality reasons ) @xmath38 and @xmath39 are generically of higher order in @xmath23 than @xmath40 , then , for small @xmath23  @xcite  : @xmath41 similarly , when @xmath42 is of higher order in @xmath23 than @xmath43 , and when @xmath44 is of higher order in @xmath23 than @xmath45 , one has  : @xmath46    these ratios are due to the geometric properties of the @xmath3 decomposition and the non - linear structure of the seed stress - energy tensor . in order to give some insight about this phenomenon , we shall present in the next paragraph the example of a scalar field .",
    "we consider a @xmath47-component real scalar field @xmath48 evolving in an arbitrary potential @xmath49 according to the general klein - gordon equations  : @xmath50 this equation describes the evolution of a large class of topological defects .",
    "the spatial traceless part of the stress - energy tensor ( denoted with a subscript @xmath51 ) does not depend on @xmath49 , and reads ( see also  @xcite )  : @xmath52 where a sum on the index @xmath53 is understood , and where @xmath54 stands for the convolution product , so that @xmath55 we decompose @xmath56 into its scalar vector and tensor parts , denoted respectively by the superscripts @xmath57 , @xmath49 , @xmath58 : @xmath59,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the notations @xmath60 now , the correlators of the spatial traceless part of the stress - energy tensor are  : @xmath61 since the source distribution is homogeneous and isotropic , this expression can be written under a form similar to eqns .",
    "( [ corr_theta]-[pijkl ] )  : @xmath62 we see that the angular dependance arises only in the tensors @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , in the limit @xmath63 , one has @xmath64 ( the scalar , vector and tensor parts are always decoupled . ) in addition , we see that in the same limit @xmath63 , all the correlators ( [ convol_3 ] ) are proportional to the integral @xmath65 ( which is always non zero , being the average of a quartic term ) so that using eqns .",
    "( [ x_svt_s]-[x_svt_t ] , [ convol_3]-[kto0 ] ) , one gets  : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a numerical factor of order unity . it is easy to show along similar lines that the correlators involving the velocities obey eqns .",
    "( [ vv12-vpi11 ] ) .",
    "several conclusions arise from this simple , although generic , model .",
    "the first is that , in the long wavelength limit , one finds , as expected , that the scalar , vector and tensor correlators of the anisotropic stress ( [ pispis]-[pitpit ] ) are in the ratio @xmath68 .",
    "the second is that this ratio is only an artefact of the @xmath3 decomposition and of the fact that the seed stress - energy tensor is quadratic in @xmath69  : it does not depend on the detailed dynamics of @xmath69 .",
    "however , due to the presence of the @xmath70 terms in the @xmath71 , as well as the presence of @xmath23 in @xmath72 [ see eqns .",
    "( [ xis]-[xit],[convol_3 ] ) ] , the angular dependance for larger @xmath23 will no longer be in the same @xmath68 ratio  : the function @xmath40 defined in eq .",
    "( [ pitpit ] ) is therefore proportional to @xmath73 , and the higher order terms in @xmath23 in @xmath74 and @xmath72 generate the expressions for @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "by definition , a coherent source is such that the correlators ( [ p0000]-[pijkl ] ) factorise  : @xmath77 such a requirement implies , as shown in details in  @xcite , that  : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the comoving hubble parameter , where @xmath80 .",
    "all the @xmath81 are arbitrary functions behaving as @xmath82 when @xmath83 , and decaying to 0 when @xmath84 .",
    "when the @xmath81 do not depend on @xmath5 , the sources have a scaling behaviour .",
    "the @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 are independant complex random variables which can be defined in such a way that @xmath88 an immediate consequence of ( [ f1f3]-[ee ] ) is  : @xmath89 and that , contrarily to the general case ( [ pipi324 ] ) , the anisotropic stress correlators of coherent sources are not in a definite ratio for small @xmath23 .",
    "the question to be asked is whether a sum of coherent sources ( with for example anisotropic stresses correlators of order @xmath90 ) can lead to a generic incoherent source ( with anisotropic stresses correlators of order @xmath91 ) .",
    "as already stressed by several authors  @xcite , an incoherent source can formally be decomposed into a sum a coherent eigenmodes , that is its correlators can be written as  : @xmath92 by coherent decomposition , we mean that the eigenmodes @xmath93 behave at low @xmath23 like the coherent sources of eqns .",
    "( [ f1f3]-[f7 ] ) . in a given topological model ,",
    "these eigenmodes are extracted from the @xmath94 given by the numerical simulation of the network  @xcite .    in the semi - analytic approach adopted here , one can conversely construct an active source by summing several functions @xmath95 ( for the tensorial part ) behaving as @xmath91 but in such a way that their sum behaves as @xmath96 so as both eqns .",
    "( [ pitpit ] ) and ( [ f7 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "we show here a simple example of how this can be realized .",
    "let us consider a set of @xmath47 functions @xmath97 obeying causality and white noise constraints [ i.e. @xmath98 when @xmath99 , and @xmath100 when @xmath101 .",
    "for simplicity only , we consider @xmath102 @xmath103 and @xmath104 being two sets of @xmath47 positive real numbers .",
    "we also impose for simplicity that @xmath105 .",
    "let us consider then @xmath106 it is easy to see that @xmath107 we then consider a function @xmath108 which is decreasing on @xmath109 and tends towards @xmath110 around @xmath111 ( for example , @xmath112 ) .",
    "it is straightforward to see that by choosing @xmath113 the set @xmath114 converges towards @xmath108 .",
    "we have therefore explicitely built a function behaving as @xmath115 with an ( infinite ) sum of functions behaving individually as @xmath91 . coming back to the correlators ,",
    "the cost is that the causality constraints fade away as we increase the number of functions in the sum since @xmath116 when @xmath117 .",
    "however , the causality constraints need not be satisfied by the coherent eigenmodes , only the sum requires causality to be satisfied .",
    "the fact that we have taken a heaviside function instead of a more regular function is not important .",
    "a set of gaussians of various widths would give the same result at the leading order in @xmath23 .",
    "the fact that we use a finite truncated sum is unimportant as well , as long as the eigenmodes we neglect influence scales much bigger than today s hubble radius only .",
    "we considered here tensor modes only , and we computed their contribution to the cmb anisotropies by means of a boltzmann code developped by one of us ( a.r .",
    ", see  @xcite for the detailed equations ) .",
    "we took a sum of coherent and scaling modes such that @xmath118 with @xmath103 and @xmath104 given by eqns .",
    "( [ dec_a_nn ] ) , such that @xmath119 the results are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig_inc ] .",
    "we see that the sum converges , and that some of the modes have roughly the same amplitude in the region of the doppler peaks , but not the same phase  : the doppler peak structure is washed out .",
    "the disappearance of doppler peaks comes from the fact that although each coherent eigenmode gives an oscillatory contribution to the cmb anisotropy , their sum does not",
    ". indeed , as @xmath120 increases , the extension in @xmath121 of @xmath122 decreases .",
    "this implies that the metric is perturbed for shorter and shorter duration hence on larger and larger scales .",
    "the fact that one has to consider a sum of several eigenmodes comes from eq .",
    "( [ convol_3 ] ) , which is a convolution product , hence is not factorisable as a product of functions @xmath123 .",
    "however , it is possible that one eigenmode dominates the sum , in which case the doppler peak structure can partially remain , as seems to be the case in the large @xmath47 model  @xcite .    finally , the convolution product appearing in eq .",
    "( [ convol_2 ] ) comes from the fact that any stress - energy tensor component is ( a least ) _",
    "quadratic _ with respect to the perturbation ( i.e. the field @xmath69 ) , therefore any correlator is at least quartic with respect to the field . in the most optimistic case , by using wick s theorem ( this is possible when one studies the large @xmath47 model , see  @xcite ) , this quartic contribution can be reduced to a quadratic one , but even in this case , the remaining formula eq .",
    "( [ convol_2 ] ) is not factorizable as a product of two quantities .    on the contrary , in inflationary scenarios ( and , more generally , in any scenario producing an initial power spectrum of fluctuations ) ,",
    "the cosmic fluids ( baryons , neutrinos , etc ) are described as coherent sources .",
    "indeed their correlators are only quadratic in the perturbations , because there exists a contribution of the fluids to the background .",
    "for example , one has ( forgetting here the metric perturbation )  : @xmath124 and so on , and solving the equations of evolution , one will find that the perturbations are _ linear _ with respect to the initial conditions ( as in the case of the large @xmath47 model , but here , the stress energy - tensor is also linear with respect to the perturbations )  : @xmath125 where @xmath126 stands for all the @xmath127 , @xmath49 , @xmath128 of the different species which take part in the initial conditions ( at @xmath129 ) . then if one calculates the correlators of the stress - energy tensor components , one obtains a quadratic dependance with respect to the perturbations , which can be cancelled by using the correlators of the initial conditions .",
    "for example  : @xmath130 moreover , all the perturbations generally are supposed ( but this is not always the case , see  @xcite ) to depend on only one random variable so that the sum in the last expression is reduced to one component .",
    "we also see that one will not get any convolution product of the form @xmath131 , and therefore the correlators will factorise .    in conclusion ,",
    "topological defects are incoherent because their stress - energy tensor is quadratic with respect to the field , whereas for standard fluids ( i.e. fluid which have a contribution to the background ) it is only linear .",
    "therefore , the fact that defects are incoherent is ultimately linked with the stiff approximation .",
