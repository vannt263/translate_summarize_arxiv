    "the observation of phenomena where the total lepton number @xmath5 is not conserved ( @xmath6 ) remains as the best way to distinguish if neutrinos are majorana fermions @xcite .",
    "the experimental signal of such a lepton - number - violating ( lnv ) processes typically implies the production of same - sign di - lepton in the final state .",
    "being forbidden within the standard model ( sm ) , they would also be a clear indication of physics beyond the sm .    the neutrinoless double-@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) decay has been regarded as the most appealing and sensitive test of such a lnv processes @xcite .",
    "observation of this nuclear decay would establish the existence of lnv processes , thus implying that neutrinos are majorana particles @xcite .",
    "up to now , the @xmath4 decay seems to be a rather elusive process and has not yet been observed experimentally .",
    "currently , the best limits on their half - lives have been obtained from the nuclei @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite . in the case",
    "when the exchange of a light massive majorana neutrino ( the so - called _ standard mechanism _ or _ mass mechanism _",
    "@xcite ) is the dominant contribution to the @xmath4 decay , the non - observation of these processes allow us to set constraints on the effective majorana mass at the sub - ev level ( @xmath9 ev ) @xcite .",
    "although the standard mechanism is considered as the most common interpretation , different new physics scenarios that generates lnv interactions can take place and therefore contribute to @xmath4 decay .",
    "these are generically classified as the long - range @xcite and short - range @xcite mechanisms .",
    "the standard interpretation belongs to the long - range one , while scenarios associated with heavy particle exchange are refered as _ non - standard mechanisms _ @xcite and they can be realized either through the long - range or short - range mechanisms @xcite .",
    "similarly to the case of the standard mechanism , the non - observation of @xmath4 allows us to set model independent bounds on lnv effective couplings @xcite .",
    "alternative @xmath6 processes to @xmath4 have been proposed both at low and high energies as complementary evidence to prove the majorana nature of neutrinos ( for a detailed list , see @xcite ) , i.e. complementary test of the lepton number non - conservation @xcite . among all these possibilities ,",
    "the low energy studies of rare processes in @xmath0 decays of pseudoscalar mesons and @xmath2-lepton have attracted a lot of attention @xcite , especially since these are accessible to different _ high - intensity frontier _ experiments .",

    "further improvements are expected by the na62 kaon factory @xcite and the lhcb in the run 2 and future upgrade run 3 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the forthcoming belle ii experiment aims to get @xmath19 40 times more data than the one accumulated by its predecessor belle ( as well as babar ) @xcite .",
    "all these efforts will increase the sensitivity on @xmath0 signals by one or two orders of magnitude .    it is known that if the exchanged majorana neutrino has a mass around @xmath19 0.1 gev to a few gev , this might be produced on its mass shell and strongly enhance the @xmath0 decays of pseudoscalar mesons and @xmath2-lepton @xcite . although this gev - scale sterile neutrino scenario is very interesting , it is worth exploring the possibility of other underlying short - range mechanism that could induce these lnv decays without involving majorana neutrinos directly , just as it occurs in @xmath4 decays . since this latter can only probe lnv short - range couplings with electron flavour @xcite",

    "<S> in this work we study the short - range contributions that induce effective lepton number violating ( lnv ) interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a full set of constraints on the effective short - range couplings from a large variety of low - energy @xmath0 processes of pseudoscalar mesons @xmath1 , and @xmath2-lepton . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints provide complementary and additional information to the one obtained from the neutrinoless double-@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) decay . as expected , the bounds on electron - electron short - range couplings are the only ones that are strongly constrained by the @xmath4 decay . </S>",
    "<S> although weaker , lnv effective couplings with different flavours are not accessible to @xmath4 decay and these can be probe by the @xmath0 processes in consideration .    </S>"
