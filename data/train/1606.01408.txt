    "our investigation on the extended charged hoava - lifshitz black holes is performed in three different ensembles ; canonical ensemble in which both charge and pressure ( cosmological constant ) are taken to be constant ; grand canonical ensemble with respect to electric charge , in which the electric charge exchanges between the black hole and its environment but pressure is fixed ; and an ensemble in which both the charge and pressure are allowed to change .",

    "we have found that for black holes with hyperbolic event horizon ( @xmath50 ) , the specific heat has a divergent point in all of these ensembles .    on the other hand ,",

    "the importance of ( extended ) ehrenfest equations in black hole thermodynamics is that they express the variation of pressure and charge in terms of other thermodynamic quantities .",

    "we have analyzed local stability of charged extended hoava - lifshitz black hole .",

    ", we have found the conditions under which the black hole is locally thermodynamically stable .",
    "we have shown that the stable charged extended hoava - lifshitz black hole lies in a region of the phase space that the thermodynamic volume is negative .",
    "we have also studied the phase transition of charged extended hoava - lifshitz black hole in thermodynamic geometry .",
    "we have examined weinhold , ruppeiner , and quevedo metric and we have shown that the scalar curvature in all of these metrics have a divergent point at the point of second order phase transition .",
    "ruppeiner curvature diverges for the extremal black hole as well",
    ". it also passes through @xmath110 and changes its sign , a behavior which is also reported for two - dimensional ideal anyon gas @xcite and some others thermodynamic systems @xcite .",
    "the problem arises for the quevedo metric which has another divergent point at the point where no phase transition occurs .",
    "it is the matter of future studies to investigate other black holes in extended phase space in the context of geometrothermodynamics to see whether they produce similar results for phase transitions .",
    "here , we extend ehrenfest equations to obtain nine relations between thermodynamic quantities which are true at the point in which the specific heat diverges . our approach is based on the recently developed method of @xcite .",
    "we consider the general case of charged extended black holes in an ensemble with fixed charge and pressure . in this ensemble",
    "the gibbs free energy is defined as @xmath130 .",

    "so , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 , where the indices @xmath59 and @xmath137 denote the state before and after the transition .",

    "<S> for charged black holes in hoava - lifshitz gravity , a second order phase transition takes place in extended phase space where the cosmological constant is taken as thermodynamic pressure . </S>",
    "<S> we relate the second order nature of phase transition to the fact that the phase transition occurs at a sharp temperature and not over a temperature interval . </S>",
    "<S> once we know the continuity of the first derivatives of the gibbs free energy , we show that all the ehrenfest equations are readily satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> we study the effect of the perturbation of the cosmological constant as well as the perturbation of the electric charge on thermodynamic stability of hoava - lifshitz black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we also use thermodynamic geometry to study phase transition in extended phase space . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the behavior of scalar curvature of weinhold , ruppeiner , and quevedo metric in extended phase space of charged hoava - lifshitz black holes . </S>",
    "<S> it is checked if these curvatures could reproduce the result of specific heat for the phase transition . </S>"
