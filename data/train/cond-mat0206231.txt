    "since the discovery of superconductivity in magnesium diboride at 39 k in january 2001 @xcite enormous amount of work has been done which helped to elucidate many of its physical properties . among others the multiband electronic structure proposed theoretically @xcite with the multiple superconducting energy gaps has been approved .",
    "the two main superconducting energy gaps have already been experimentally evidenced by different techniques like for instance specific heat measurments @xcite or andreev reflection @xcite . a larger gap is attributed to two - dimensional @xmath8 orbitals and a smaller gap to three - dimensional @xmath9 bonding and antibonding orbitals .",
    "such a picture indicates a significant anisotropy of the superconducting state .",
    "data reported so far on the anisotropy factor @xmath10 scatter from 1.1 to 13 depending on the form of material ( polycrystals , thin films , single crystals ) and method of evaluation .",
    "the problem remains to be clarified on high quality single crystals .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the experimental details are given in section ii . in section iii , we show a consistent way of extracting the upper critical field @xmath1 for magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the basal @xmath11 planes .",
    "@xmath1 has been determined in the entire temperature range by high field magnetotransport , and those values are compared to the ones deduced from @xmath12-susceptibility below 5 t and specific heat measurments below 7 t. the perpendicular critical field reveals a conventional character with a linear temperature dependence near @xmath3 and @xmath13 3.5 t while @xmath14 shows a positive curvature at temperatures above @xmath15 k with @xmath16 17 t. as a consequence the anisotropy factor @xmath17 is temperature dependent with @xmath17(0 k ) @xmath18 5 and @xmath17(near @xmath3 ) about 2 .",
    "the angular dependence of the upper critical field measured at 5.4 k and 26 k show an elliptic form as predicted by a one - band ginzburg - landau theory , but obviously this theory can not account for the temperature dependent @xmath17 parameter .",
    "finally , the magnetic field and angular dependence of the critical current deduced from @xmath0susceptibility measurments is discussed in section iv .",
    "experiments have been performed on high quality mgb@xmath19 single crystals coming from one batch@xcite .",
    "the crystals show clear hexagonal facets with flat and shiny surfaces .",
    "the typical dimensions are 50x50x10 @xmath20m@xmath21 .",
    "the resistivity has been measured at 13 hz as a function of magnetic field up to @xmath22 t for different temperatures and angles ( @xmath23 ) between @xmath6 and the @xmath11-planes of the crystal .",
    "the magnetic field was always orthogonal to the measuring current .",
    "gold electrodes have been evaporated as stripes overlapping the top plane of the sample with contact resistance of about 1 @xmath24 in the four - probe configuration .",
    "the @xmath0susceptibility was deduced from the local transmittivity measured with a miniature hall probe .",
    "the @xmath12 excitation field ( @xmath25 g , @xmath26hz ) was perpendicular to the @xmath7planes and to the hall probe plane and superimposed to a @xmath27 field which was making an angle @xmath28 with the planes .",
    "the specific heat was measured by an @xmath12 technique @xcite allowing us to measure small samples ( here @xmath29 nano - grammes ) .",
    "heat was supplied to the sample at a frequency @xmath30 of the order of @xmath31 hz by a light emitting diode via an optical fiber .",
    "the induced temperature oscillations were measured by a @xmath32m - diam chromel - constantan thermocouple that was calibrated in situ .",
    "1 displays the temperature dependence of the specific heat at various magnetic fields up to 7 t for @xmath34-planes and up to 2 t for @xmath6 perpendicular to those planes . in zero field , the specific heat discontinuity at @xmath3 , @xmath35 , represents only about 3 @xmath36 of the total signal , i.e. 5 to 6 times less than in the best polycristalline samples @xcite .",
    "however , our samples are extremely small and the addenda contribution are thus very large although impossible to estimate accurately .",
    "the data are therefore given in arbitrary units and the temperature range is limited to @xmath37 12 k. no significant increase of the transition width , @xmath38 2 k , is observed for @xmath39 2 t and @xmath40 5 t. despite a clear broadening above these chareristic fields , the specific heat anomaly remains well defined in the entire explored temperature range .",
    "these results imply that the broadening of the transition width observed in polycristalline samples @xcite is due to randomly oriented anisotropic grains rather than to thermodynamic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the curves are remarkably identical for both directions once the field is renormalized by the temperature dependent anisotropy coefficient ( see inset of fig . 1 for instance ) .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the amplitude of the specific heat jump @xmath41 decreases much too rapidly with @xmath6 implying a rapid increase of the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath42 and therefore of the density of states .",
    "an entropy conservation construction shows that @xmath43 0.9@xmath44 ( where @xmath45 is related to the normal state density of states ) for @xmath460.5 @xmath1 in good agreement with recent low temperature measurments by bouquet et al .",
    "@xcite . +    the critical temperature has been determined using the classical entropy conservation construction",
    ". the corresponding @xmath1 values as well as the one deduced from susceptibility ( onset of the diamagnetic response ) and transport measurments have been reported in fig .",
    "2 . in the latter case",
    ", the critical field @xmath47 or temperature @xmath48 values have been defined at the onset of finite resistivity ( see fig .",
    "+ some of us have previously shown that the onset of finite resistivity coincides with the location of the specific heat anomaly for @xmath49 . here",
    "we show that the same holds for parallel fields @xmath34 .",
    "note that the resistivity reaches the normal state value at a magnetic field @xmath50 higher than the as - deduced upper critical field ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "below we argue that @xmath50 is due to the surface effects .",
    "+    one can see that all three presented methods reveal the same results in the common range of applied fields ( @xmath515 t ) .",
    "the upper critical field perpendicular to the basal plane has a typical temperature dependence for a type - ii superconductor with a linear shape near the zero - field transition temperature and a saturation at the lowest temperatures with @xmath52 t. on the other hand the parallel upper critical field has a different strength and shape : close to @xmath3 , @xmath53 reveals a positive curvature which changes to negative below 20 k and saturates to about @xmath54 tesla at the lowest temperatures .",
    "a direct consequence of the different forms of the temperature dependencies of these two critical fields is a temperature dependent anisotropy factor @xmath17 .",
    "then , @xmath555 is found at low temperatures but it is about 2 near @xmath3 ( see inset of fig .",
    "+ the presented data extend the ones previously obtained by some of us for @xmath56 t on crystals from the same batch @xcite . it has been suggested that the positive curvature observed here for @xmath34 is a consequence of the two - gap structure @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that a very similar behavior has also been observed in conventional superconductors including nbse@xmath19 @xcite , borocarbides @xcite and was believed to be a universal characteristic of layered compounds @xcite .",
    "this is even more `` general '' as it has also been observed in the isotropic ( k , ba)bio@xmath57 system @xcite . the origin of this effect thus still has to be clarified .",
    "3 represents the resistive transitions from the superconducting to normal state taken at 5.4 k for different angles between @xmath6 and the @xmath11-planes of the crystal .",
    "the measurments have been done at the current density 500 a/@xmath58 ( solid lines ) . the current dependence of the transition for perpendicular fields ( @xmath49 ) - which is also highly non - ohmic - has been attributed to surface conductivity in a previous paper by some of us @xcite .",
    "we have found similar , albeit a bit weaker@xcite , effects for parallel fields ( @xmath34 ) down to the lowest temperatures . in fig . 3 for both principal field orientations @xmath34 and @xmath59 an effect of the measuring current is presented .",
    "it shows that the transitions are indeed current dependent . for current densities equal to 17 , 50 , 170 a/@xmath58 transitions are smooth and for @xmath59 the onset of the finite resistivity is even shifted towards higher fields for decreasing current densities . for @xmath60 500 a/@xmath58 the onset of the transition is not changed anymore ( measured up to 2000 a/@xmath58 ) and shows up as an abrupt jump at @xmath61 ( for @xmath34 already at 170 a/@xmath58 ) followed by a smooth transition towards the normal state resistance @xmath62 .",
    "the ratio between the fields at the onset of finite resistivity at 500 a/@xmath58 ( @xmath63 ) and the one at the end of the transition at the lowest current @xmath64 is about 1.8 for @xmath59 and 1.4 for @xmath65 .",
    "this ratio remains constant for all temperatures apart those very close to @xmath3 , where it is affected by the intrinsic width of the transition @xmath66 .",
    "+ our measurments can be compared to the ones obtained in a pioneering work on surface effects in type - ii superconductors by hempstead and kim @xcite .",
    "they performed measurments on nb@xmath67ta@xmath67 and pb@xmath68in@xmath69 sheets .",
    "for fields parallel to the surface of the sheets ( that is a favorable configuration for appearance of surface superconductivity ) they obtained results strikingly similar to ours .",
    "for sufficiently low current densities , the onset of a finite resistance is sensitive to the excitation current since the surface sheath could bear a current keeping the zero resistance even above @xmath1 .",
    "however , above some threshold current , this surface superconductivity is destroyed and the onset field does not change anymore ; it has thus been identified with the upper critical field @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "as obverved in our data , for @xmath70 the resistance of the sheets increased sharply to a fraction of @xmath62 which was bigger for higher current and then , the resistance finally went smoothly to the normal state @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath71 was best defined when measured at the lowest possible current density , but the experimental @xmath72 ratio scattered between 1.6 and 1.96 and droped down to 1.14 for copper coated pb - in sheets .",
    "indeed , the configuration of our transport experiment with @xmath34 is very favorable for surface effects which must then be taken into account . on the other hand , surface superconductivity effects should be negligible for @xmath49 .",
    "however , in our experimental set - up the current and voltage electrodes overlapping the sample go over the vertical side planes which thus inevitably contribute to surface superconductivity as well .",
    "+ @xmath1 in mgb@xmath19 crystals has been measured by several authors in a limited temperature range .",
    "the @xmath73 values of angst et al .",
    "@xcite obtained via torque magnetometry are in a good agreement with ours while @xmath14 are slightly higher ( implying a slightly higher anisotropy parameter ) .",
    "similar @xmath1 values have also been obtained by sologubenko et al .",
    "@xcite from the magnetic field and temperature dependencies of the thermal conductivity below @xmath74 tesla .",
    "they also found a standard dependence for @xmath75 , and a positive curvature for @xmath76 above @xmath77 k. our data are in very good agreement with those obtained by the measurments of the magnetic moment in mgb@xmath19 single crystals by zehetmayer et al .",
    "finally , budko and canfield @xcite have arrived to similar conclusions by extracting the superconducting anisotropy from the magnetization measurments on randomly oriented powder samples .",
    "it was however of fundamental importance to show that the `` critical fields '' obtained from all those measurments coincide with the thermodynamic transition deduced from specific heat measurments .",
    "in many novel superconductors fluctuations broadens the transitions from the superconducting to the normal state in magnetic field .",
    "one of the most striking phenomenon which has been observed in these systems is the existence of a melting line @xmath78 above which the vortex lattice melts into a liquid of entangled lines .",
    "the presence of this liquid phase complicates the determination of the upper critical field @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , the onset of a finite resistance in those systems is indicating the melting transition ( at @xmath79 ) while the upper critical field is located at a very end of the resistive transition @xmath80 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "however , fluctuations are not expected to play any significant role in mgb@xmath19 as confirmed by specific heat measurments : the width @xmath41 does not increase significantly with magnetic field and the upper critical field occurs near the onset of finite resistance at @xmath79 .",
    "a non correct criterion for the @xmath1 determination partly explains the discrepancy in the values deduced from transport measurments @xcite .",
    "+    next , we discuss the angular dependence of the critical field . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the resistivity rapidly drops towards zero at @xmath81 16 t for @xmath34 and progressively shifts towards lower fields as the angle increases .",
    "the corresponding @xmath82 can be well fitted by the the simple ellipsoidal form @xmath83 of lawrence and doniach @xcite for anisotropic three - dimensional superconductors with @xmath84 ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "a similar dependence has been observed at 26 k ( not shown ) but with @xmath85 3.4 . by triangles",
    "we have also plotted the characteristic fields @xmath50 . if surface conductivity becomes important for @xmath86 and @xmath34",
    "( @xmath50 is then close to @xmath71 ) , this effect is diminished for other field orientations and the @xmath87 ratio drops down to @xmath88 .",
    "surface conductivity effects can thus account for the cusp - like behavior of @xmath50 at small angles which has been first attributed to @xmath1 by other authors @xcite .",
    "another interesting phenomenon is the observation of a peak effect in the critical current .",
    "this effect shows up in our transport measurments in the same way as in@xcite and is also visible in our susceptibility data in a small magnetic field range @xmath89 t for @xmath6 perpendicular to the @xmath7plane .",
    "this increase in the critical current appears as a dip in the susceptibility in both temperature and magnetic field sweeps as also reported by pissas et al . for the same field orientation @xcite .",
    "surprizingly , the peak effect is only visible in a narrow magnetic field range . for lower magnetic fields ,",
    "the peak is replaced by a rapid drop of the susceptibility and it has been suggested by pissas et al .",
    "@xcite that this drop could be associated with a first order transition in the vortex lattice in analogy with high @xmath3 oxides . however , in mgb@xmath19 , the peak effects appears close the @xmath1 line and no sign for the existence of a vortex liquid could be obtained in our experiments .",
    "+    the peak is here reflecting the fact that the shear energy of the flux lattice drops towards zero more rapidly than the pinning energy in the vicinity of the normal state allowing to the vortex matter to accomodate more efficiently to the disorder close to the transition @xcite .",
    "moreover , as shown in fig . 5 , the value of the peak current rapidly decreases for increasing temperature ( i.e. for decreasing magnetic field ) but probably still exists at high temperature .",
    "similarly , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "5 , the dip in the susceptibility ( that is the peak in the current density ) also rapidly disappears as the magnetic fields is turned away from the @xmath5axis .",
    "however , the peak effect is still visible in transport measurments for @xmath34 again suggesting that the peak has shifted towards lower @xmath90 values when the magnetic field was turned and thus disappeared from our experimental window .",
    "the @xmath90 values presented in fig.5 have been deduced from the magnetic field dependence of the @xmath0susceptibility .",
    "indeed , in the non linear regime , the @xmath12 response is related to the current density @xmath90 through : @xmath91 where @xmath92 depends on the pinning mechanism , the sample geometry and the flux dynamics .",
    "@xmath93 has been determined experimentally following the procedure introduced by pasquini _",
    "_ @xcite and is in very good agreement with the numerical calculations performed by brandt @xcite for bulk pinning in cylinders ( with the appropriate thickness / radius ratio ) .",
    "note that our critical current values are much smaller than the one previously obtained in polycrystals @xcite but , as shown below , @xmath90 sharply increases when the field is applied parallel to the @xmath7 planes . + as shown in the inset of fig.5 , at low temperature , the susceptibility ( and thus the critical current ) only weakly depends on @xmath23 down to @xmath94 degrees and the rapid drop of the susceptibility close to @xmath1 is progressively shifted towards higher temperature for decreasing @xmath23 values . finally close to the @xmath7plane the susceptibility rapidly decreases showing that the pinning of the vortices is much more efficient for @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath95 values at @xmath96 k are displayed in the inset of fig .",
    "4 showing that @xmath90 increases by a factor of about @xmath97 for @xmath6 parallel to the @xmath7planes .",
    "a similar behavior has been observed in the critical current deduced from transport measurments in @xmath5axis oriented thin films @xcite and eltsev _ et al .",
    "_ recently reported on a rapid drop of the dissipation when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the @xmath7planes in single crystals @xcite .",
    "a similar cusp in the critical current has been observed in high @xmath3 cuprates in which the vortices are strongly pinning by the weakly superconducting layers between the cuo@xmath19 planes when the field is applied parallel to those planes ( so called intrinsic pinning @xcite ) .",
    "however , the origin of the strong pinning of the @xmath7 planes in diborides still has to be clarified given the rather small anisotropy of this material .",
    "in summary , the upper critical field has been deduced from specific heat , high magnetic field transport and @xmath12-susceptibility measurments for @xmath6 parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath7planes . @xmath1",
    "perpendicular to the planes reveals a conventional temperature dependence with @xmath98 3.5 tesla but the parallel critical field with @xmath99 17 tesla has a positive curvature at temperatures above 20 k. consequently , the anisotropy factor @xmath100 is temperature dependent decreasing from @xmath101 at low temperature towards @xmath102 close to @xmath3 .",
    "the critical current deduced from the susceptibility measurments present a sharp peak effect for @xmath103 t. at low temperatures , @xmath90 only depends weakly on the angle between @xmath6 and the @xmath7plane for @xmath104 degrees but rapidly increases for @xmath34 .",
