    "[ fig5ins ] ) .",
    "these spectral features and their magnetic or phonon origin are understood with the help of aimd simulations ( below ) , which reproduce the inelastic scattering response and allow deeper insight via partial vibrational densities of states and specific two , three or four atom correlation functions .     at t=2 k ( blue ) and",

    "note that the atoms are classical particles in the aimd simulations so that their displacements do not include zero - point motion , which can be of the order of 30% for hydrogen at room temperature .",
    "calculated mean - square displacements ( msd ) averaged over all atoms of the same type are 0.0177 @xmath78 for cu , 0.0300 @xmath78 for cl , 0.0093 @xmath78 for o and 0.0283 @xmath78 for n. this is in good agreement with values obtained by projection on specified bond directions from the 80 k crystal structure refinement listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "+ the md simulations are validated by comparing calculated and measured scattering functions .",
    "we note that the low frequency modes are independent of hydrogen or deuterium ( h / d ) substitution and must therefore be delocalized modes involving many atoms .",
    "an acoustic phonon would show a 2% frequency shift upon deuteration .",
    "fig.[fig2md ] shows the coherent scattering function @xmath79 from the 27 ps simulation on the deuterated system .",
    "spectra at lower q - values have weak intensity and are not reliably calculated with our model .",
    "low frequency , numerical noise in the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) contributes strongly to the coherent structure factor since this quantity is proportional to vdos / frequency . at high q",
    "there are peaks at 2 mev , 4.5 mev and 7 mev and a shoulder at @xmath3410 mev which are consistent with the experimental data ( figs .  [ fig1ins]-[fig5ins ] ) .",
    "since the aimd simulations do not include spin degrees of freedom , these peaks can only be the signature of lattice excitations and , as expected , their intensities increase with increasing q. the coherent scattering function is only calculated at the reciprocal lattice points of the simulation cell so that q - sampling is limited to the brillouin zone centre when using a single cell for the md simulations .",
    "simulated spectral peaks therefore correspond to @xmath33-point modes .",
    "+ atomic contributions to the signal are obtained from the partial vdos ( pvdos ) which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3md ] top .",
    "each pvdos has been normalized to the corresponding number of degrees of freedom , 3@xmath80 , where @xmath80 is the number of a particular species .",
    "fairly well - defined peaks exist at the lowest frequencies in the low temperature md simulations .",
    "the delocalized nature of the modes is shown by the fact that all atoms have similar pvdos s below @xmath345 mev .",
    "this result is consistent with there being negligible spectral shift upon deuteration .",
    "the trapped oxygen atom has a characteristic vibration frequency of the order of 55 mev and this is the only atom that does not contribute to the lowest frequency modes .",
    "the analysis of the chlorine atoms has been refined to separate the contributions from apical atoms and those in the square base around the copper tetrahedron .",
    "there is a small but significant softening of the apical - chlorine vibrations compared to those of the square - base chlorines , average frequencies and standard deviations being , respectively , 18.8@xmath8113.5 mev and 20.3@xmath8114.4 mev .",
    "[ fig3md ] bottom shows examples of the lowest frequency part of the vdos for d , c and cu for different lengths of simulations .",
    "the dotted curves show the results from a 10 ps trajectory while the solid curves are derived from the 27 ps trajectory .",
    "the longer trajectory gives better frequency resolution which shows that the first peaks in the dos occur at 2 mev .",
    "spectral peaks below this frequency must therefore be of magnetic origin .",
    "+ features of the vdos can be further understood by considering n - atom correlations .",
    "the frequency spectrum of interatomic distances involving cu atoms is shown in fig.[fig4md ] .",
    "the cu - cu stretch is strongest at @xmath3412 mev .",
    "the twisting deformation of the tetrahedron , that is the angle variation between cu - cu vectors on opposite sides of the tetrahedron , also has a characteristic frequency of @xmath3412 mev .",
    "these are the modes that could directly modulate the magnetic copper - copper interactions .",
    "the oxygen pathway is clearly not modified by any low frequency modes whereas the copper - chlorine distance modulations show a significant amplitude from 25 mev down to the lowest frequencies .",
    "+ spin restricted aimd simulations are the only way to gain insight into the low frequency modes measured on focus and in4 .",
    "simulations show excitations at above 2 mev and at @xmath344.5 mev which grow in intensity with q and therefore correspond mainly to molecular vibrations . below these frequencies , the longest simulations ( 27 ps )",
    "indicate that there are no lower lying lattice vibrations implying that the lower energy features observed in the experiment are of magnetic origin .     of deuterated @xmath0.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] [ fig2md ]        [ fig3md ]     [ fig4md ]",
    "the @xmath0 system comprises a very interesting magnetic unit - a cu@xmath1 s=1/2 tetrahedron . due to the geometry of the cluster two exchange paths are possible : antiferromagnetic cu - o - cu via the central oxygen atom and ferromagnetic cu - cl - cu via the peripheral chlorine atoms . in the ideal system",
    "the af exchange with j=-1.8 mev dominates .",
    "+ our dft calculations show that unpaired electron is only partially localized in the cu @xmath9-states , and hybridizes strongly with the oxygen atom in the center of the tetrahedron and is further delocalized around atomic cores within the molecule . besides the o@xmath82 and cl@xmath83 ions , which certainly participate in the cu - cu superexchange , the n@xmath18c bond might play an important role of the charge reservoir .",
    "we plan to confirm this picture by polarised neutron spin density mapping and to study the interplay between electron delocalization and magnetic interactions in more detail .",
    "+ the presence of strong molecular vibrations emerge from our ins experiments and spin restricted aimd simulations .",
    "although all atoms participate in the vibrations , it is the organic ligands and the apical cl@xmath83 ions of the cluster which vibrate most strongly , while the o@xmath82 ion remains pinned in the center of the tetrahedron . therefore the spin - vibrational hamiltonian suggested by jones@xcite and polinger et al.@xcite might be the appropriate model to describe the ideal @xmath0 system .",
    "+ however , the properties of real samples , can not be that easily attributed to this model . measurements of the bulk properties of single crystals reveal strong anisotropy which dominates also the bulk properties of polycrystalline samples .",
    "we infer that only part of the clusters retain the spin singlet ground state , while another part has magnetic ground state and the ratio between these fractions is sample and thermal history dependent .",
    "+ the anisotropy originates most probably from defects introduced during the sample synthesis as there is only small energy difference between several molecular configurations . the isostructural order - disorder structural crossover at t@xmath42=282 k",
    "complicates the situation even more , as applied magnetic field and thermal history may affect which molecule configuration freezes - in determining in this way the magnetic exchange at low temperatures . in this sense",
    "the high - temperature manifold of molecular configurations governs magnetic exchange at low temperature . + it is well possible that molecular vibrations influence the low temperature magnetic properties as well , we leave this question open for future investigations .",
    "we suspect that unusual magnetic susceptibility measured for other representatives of the system@xcite might have similar origin to @xmath0 .",
    "it is important to note that influence of the structural and vibrational degrees of freedoms on magnetic properties of molecular magnets is recognized in a number of other systems , for example in @xmath84 complex@xcite,@xmath85 spin tetrahedron@xcite , @xmath86 spin triangle@xcite .",
    "+ finally , the complications of the real samples hinder answering the initial question which motivated our research , namely whether the ground state of an isolated tetrahedron with antiferromagnetic exchange remains degenerate or whether this degeneracy is easily lifted by some small perturbation .",
    "our study reveals that the behaviour of such `` simple '' systems is quite complex and is governed by high sensitivity of electronic structure of the system on the precise molecular configuration and this determines the magnetic behaviour of the material .",
