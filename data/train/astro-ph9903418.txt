    "the localization of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) by the wide field camera ( wfc ) on the bepposax satellite ( boella et al .",
    "1997 ) has enabled rapid and detailed follow - up studies to be made at other wavelengths , including x - ray ( costa et al . 1997 ) , optical ( van paradijs et al . 1997 ) , and radio ( frail et al .",
    "perhaps the most important result of this breakthrough has been the measurement of cosmological redshifts for five bursts ( metzger et al .",
    "1997 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ; djorgovski et al . 1998a , 1999 ) , and the detection of faint host galaxies for these five plus four others , leading to the conclusion that the majority of , if not all grbs , are the most energetic events in the universe .",
    "grb  980519 was one of the brightest in the bepposax wfc ( muller et al .",
    "1998 ; in t zand et al . 1999 ) , second only to grb 990123 ( feroci et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the onset of 227 kev emission from grb 980159 in the wfc preceded the batse trigger on may 19.514035 ut by about 70  s ( in t zand et al .",
    "1999 ) , a phenomenon which characterizes only a few percent of bursts .",
    "the batse measured fluence above 25  kev was @xmath7 ergs  @xmath8 , among the top 12% of batse bursts ( connaughton 1998 ) .",
    "an x - ray observation with the bepposax narrow field instruments ( nfi ) began 9.7 hr after the burst ( nicastro et al .",
    "1998 ) , and detected an afterglow with a 210  kev flux of @xmath9 ergs  @xmath8  s@xmath10 in the first 4 hours , which faded by about a factor of 4 in the 1.2 days following .",
    "the optical afterglow of grb  980519 was discovered by jaunsen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) 8.8  hr after the burst using the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) .",
    "initially estimated at magnitude @xmath11 , this was the first optical afterglow to appear brighter than the limiting magnitude of the palomar sky survey , thus enabling immediate recognition .",
    "djorgovski et al . (",
    "1998b ) confirmed the optical transient ( ot ) , and noted that its decay was consistent with @xmath12 .",
    "kemp and halpern ( 1998 ) obtained additional photometry and calibrations which showed that the initial not detection was actually brighter than first suggested ( @xmath13 , see below ) .",
    "vla observations within the first three days ( frail , taylor , & kulkarni 1998 ) detected a variable 8.3 ghz source at the position of the ot .",
    "sub - millimeter observations at the jcmt eight days after the burst yielded only upper limits ( smith et al .",
    "two months after the burst , deep optical observations detected a faint coincident object of magnitude @xmath14 ( sokolov et al . 1998 ) or @xmath15 ( bloom et al .",
    "1998a ) , which is presumed to be the grb host galaxy . its redshift has not been determined .",
    "we obtained @xmath16 and @xmath17 photometry of grb  980519 on the mdm observatory 1.3 m telescope , and a @xmath18 image on the wiyn 3.5 m telescope , both on kitt peak .",
    "figure  1 shows the @xmath17-band image and the bepposax nfi error circle .",
    "we measure a position for the ot of ( j2000 ) @xmath19 , with an error radius of @xmath20 .",
    "this is consistent with the radio position reported by frail et al .",
    "exposure times were @xmath21  s in @xmath16 and @xmath22  s in @xmath17 .",
    "the sky was reasonably clear during the mdm observations , where we also obtained calibrations using the standard star field of pg  0918 + 029 ( landolt 1992 ) .",
    "conditions started to deteriorate soon thereafter , when a single uncalibrated 600  s @xmath18 image was obtained at wiyn .",
    "the results of these observations are listed in table  1 .",
    "also listed are all available photometry from other observatories .",
    "some of these observations were obtained with independent calibrations , and some were reported with respect to comparison stars calibrated by others .",
    "we have done our best to convert all of the reported magnitudes to a common system in table  1 . during this campaign",
    "three different calibrations were employed , those of mdm ( kemp & halpern 1998 ) , palomar ( bloom et al .",
    "1998b , gal et al . 1998 ) , and the usno ( henden et al . 1998 ) .",
    "since the usno calibration set is the most complete , and was obtained on photometric nights with landolt standards , we have chosen to adopt this system .",
    "we find that in @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the mdm magnitudes of comparison stars are fainter than the usno by 0.10 , while the palomar magnitudes are fainter by 0.07 . in @xmath18",
    "the palomar magnitudes are brighter than the usno by 0.2 , while in @xmath23 palomar is brighter by 0.14 .",
    "accordingly , these corrections have been applied to the published magnitudes .    in figure  2 we graph the light curves in four bands using the data from table  1 . for clarity ,",
    "upper limits are not plotted as they do not contribute any additional constraints .",
    "also not plotted are the unfiltered magnitudes of maury et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , although these are roughly consistent with the @xmath17-band light curve .",
    "all of the bands are consistent with the same power - law decay , @xmath24 .",
    "the solid lines represent the best fit to a single decay constant , with only the normalization adjusted for each band .",
    "we note that the power - law decay index of the x - ray afterglow , @xmath25 as reported by owens et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , is consistent with the optical , and that these are cotemporaneous observations .",
    "it is possible to synthesize a @xmath1 spectrum from these data by interpolating the magnitudes to a particular time .",
    "we chose a time of may 20.34 ut , 19.8  hr after the burst , because it coincides with the largest number of measurements , and because the resulting spectrum can be compared with the x - ray flux from the simultaneous bepposax follow - up .",
    "the interpolated @xmath1 magnitudes were converted to fluxes using the effective wavelengths and normalizations of fukugita , shimasaku , & ichikawa ( 1995 ) , and graphed as filled circles in figure  3 .",
    "galactic reddening is a significant factor in this field because of its intermediate galactic latitude , @xmath26 .",
    "the selective extinction @xmath27 can be estimated in at least two ways .",
    "first is the value of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) from the _ iras _",
    "@xmath28 m maps , @xmath29  mag .",
    "this is somewhat different from a second estimate , @xmath30  mag , which can be derived from the galactic 21 cm column density in this direction , @xmath31  @xmath8 ( stark et al .",
    "1992 ) , and the standard conversion @xmath32  @xmath8  mag@xmath10 ( savage & mathis 1979 ) .",
    "figure  3 shows the results of applying each of these corrections , using the relative extinctions from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in either case",
    ", the spectrum is a good fit to a power law of the form @xmath33 .",
    "the smaller extinction requires @xmath34 , while the larger extinction corresponds to @xmath35 .",
    "regarding these two choices as indicative of the range of systematic error , we adopt @xmath36 as a final result and uncertainty .",
    "although there is no strong evidence of additional reddening intrinsic to the afterglow , one can not rule out small amounts that are comparable to the systematic uncertainties in the galactic value .",
    "an additional constraint on the total extinction can be obtained in a weakly model - dependent way by comparing the extrapolated optical spectrum to the simultaneous x - ray flux as measured by the bepposax nfi .",
    "if the synchrotron afterglow models have any validity , then the optical - to - x - ray spectral index @xmath37 should be less than or equal to the @xmath36 measured in the optical band alone .",
    "that is , if there are any breaks in the broad - band spectrum , they should be concave downward . in order to make this comparison",
    ", we must estimate the x - ray flux at the fiducial time of the synthesized optical spectrum .",
    "the x - ray afterglow spectrum is fitted by energy index @xmath38 ( owens et al .",
    "1998 ) . using this index ,",
    "we convert the flux of @xmath9 ergs  @xmath8  s@xmath10 measured in the 210 kev band in the interval between 9.7 and 13.7 hours after the burst ( nicastro et al .",
    "1998 ) to a flux of @xmath39jy at 4.5  kev .",
    "the x - ray temporal decay of grb  980518 , @xmath25 , is the fastest of the seven afterglows that were well measured by bepposax ( owens et al .",
    "1998 ) . from this temporal decay",
    ", we infer that by @xmath40  h the flux had faded by a factor of 3 to @xmath41jy .",
    "figure  4 shows the broad - band optical to x - ray spectrum at @xmath42  h estimated in this manner .",
    "we allow for an uncertainty of @xmath43 on the x - ray flux in this crude analysis .",
    "the optical spectrum and its uncertainties in extrapolation are consistent with the x - ray flux , and jointly they prefer @xmath37 of about 1.05 . we conclude that any intrinsic optical extinction is small , and that a single power law is a marginally consistent description of all the available optical through x - ray data .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath44 as an observed constraint on models .",
    "other bursts with well measured light curves have @xmath45 in the range 1.1 to 1.2 ( bloom et al . 1998c ; diercks et al . 1998 ; reichart et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the grb  980519 data described here provide the one case of a steep ( @xmath46 ) afterglow decay that is well documented at several frequencies .",
    "therefore , the continuum spectral shape , together with the temporal decay , can be used to test afterglow models that relate these two quantities . in the simplest form of the external relativistic blast wave model ( mszars & rees 1997 ; wijers , rees , and mszars 1997 ) , electrons accelerated to a power - law energy distribution proportional to @xmath47 ,",
    "are responsible for a decaying synchrotron spectrum of the form @xmath48 .",
    "the energy index @xmath49 if the cooling time is longer than the age of the shock ( the adiabatic case ) , and it is related to the corresponding temporal decay constant as @xmath50 . since we observe @xmath51 all across the spectrum from optical to x - ray , we would expect a spectral slope @xmath52 , incompatible with the observed @xmath44 .",
    "although the optical slope alone is consistent with @xmath53 , such a model falls short of matching the x - ray flux by a factor of 10 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath54 would predict @xmath55 , incompatible with either the x - ray or the optical decay .",
    "if , instead , we assume that the electrons are in the `` cooling '' regime , for which @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( e.g. , sari , piran , & narayan 1998 ) , then the discrepancy is even worse , since @xmath58 would require @xmath59 . if there is actually a cooling break _ between _ the optical and the x - ray at the epoch illustrated in figure  4 , or additional extinction in the grb host galaxy , it would exacerbate the discrepancy between @xmath45 and @xmath60 in the optical .    of course",
    ", these are idealized models involving isotropic expansion into a homogeneous medium .",
    "one modification to the model that might be more compatible with grb  980519 is an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "mszars , rees , & wijers ( 1998 ) calculated the effects of differing power - law density distributions @xmath61 for the shocked medium and concluded that @xmath5 would result in @xmath62 if @xmath63 .",
    "both of these values are consistent with grb  980519 .",
    "an @xmath5 dependence is appropriate for a pre - existing stellar wind .",
    "alternatively , one can consider anisotropic beaming models .",
    "it has long been hypothesized that grbs are beamed , as a way of ameliorating the energetics problem .",
    "although we have no redshift for grb  980519 and therefore no handle on its energetics , the fact that its host galaxy at @xmath64 ( @xmath65 corrected for galactic extinction ) is one of the fainter of the nine probable hosts detected so far means that it could be quite distant and energetic .",
    "[ grb  981220 has a coincident object of @xmath66 ( bloom et al .",
    "only grb  980326 is apparently lacking a host galaxy to a limiting magnitude @xmath67 ( bloom & kulkarni 1998 ) .",
    "] assuming that grb  980519 is at @xmath68 , for @xmath69 km  s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 and @xmath70 its luminosity distance is at least @xmath71  cm and the batse measured fluence of @xmath7 ergs  @xmath8 corresponds to an isotropic energy of @xmath72  ergs .",
    "this number would rise to @xmath73  ergs at @xmath74 , greater than that of the highest redshift burst , grb  971214 at @xmath75 , for which an isotropic energy of @xmath76  ergs was inferred ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 ) .    jet models ( rhoads 1999 ) predict a transition from radial expansion to lateral spreading , after which the temporal decay steepens to @xmath77 .",
    "values of @xmath78 in the range 22.5 are expected . in an accompanying paper ( sari et al .",
    "1999 ) , predictions of jet models for grb  980519 and other afterglows are explored , under the assumption that a transition from radial to transverse expansion had already occurred before the first optical observation .",
    "we consider that the combination of the steep afterglow decay and faint and possibly distant host galaxy of grb  980519 make it a good candidate for a jet .",
