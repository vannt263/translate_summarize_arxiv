    "the electron cyclotron resonance ion source ( ecris ) is used to deliver beams of singly or multiply charged ions for a wide range of applications in many laboratories . in particular , such devices are well suited for the production of highly charged ions ( hcis )  a key consideration for the new acceleration facilities ( e.g. fair , ria , hribf , etc . ) , which will require milliampere levels of hcis . in order to get such high currents ,",
    "the recent progress in the performance of the ecris has been mainly linked to improvement of the plasma magnetic confinement within the source chamber and to an increase of the frequency for the feeding microwaves which , under proper conditions , develop to higher plasma densities @xcite .",
    "the trend followed until now has been to increase the frequency and the magnetic field , leading to rising costs for the technology and safety problems for the magnet s cryostat because of the growth of hot electrons : the frequency and magnetic field scaling are close to saturation .",
    "apart from this main route , various techniques are also employed to enhance the production of hcis , such as the use of secondary emission materials , the wall coatings , the installation of a bias disc , or gas mixing , to mention the most important ones @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the past decade , some experiments involving new approaches to feeding have allowed an increase in the performance of the conventional ecr ion sources with a minimum-@xmath0 magnetic field structure by feeding them with electromagnetic waves that have a large spectral content , or that are obtained by the superimposition of a discrete set of microwaves at different frequencies @xcite .",
    "even if these experiments have provided interesting results , they have not given us an explanation or a methodology to convey a better understanding of the coupling mechanism between a feeding waveguide and a cavity filled with plasma , and the energy transfer between the electromagnetic field in the source plasma chamber and the plasma confined therein .",
    "an increase of knowledge in terms of microwave coupling to ecris plasma , and therefore optimization of the ecr power transfer processes , may allow us to design ion sources with higher performance .",
    "further improvements of ecris output currents and the average charge state require a deep understanding of electron and ion dynamics in the plasma , and of the impact of the electromagnetic structure on the electron density distribution : theoretical investigations , in order to find a reasonable and adequate model for these mechanisms and to predict their possible improvement , may lead to the design of a future innovative ecr ion source .    over recent years",
    ", dedicated experiments at infn - lns have aimed to investigate these topics and , at the same time , some theoretical studies have been undertaken to describe them in detail @xcite .",
    "the microwave coupling between the electromagnetic wave and the plasma determines the efficient transfer of the energy from the microwaves to the plasma electrons inside the ecris . the plasma chamber , on the other hand ,",
    "can be considered as a resonant cavity for the electromagnetic waves and , when the magnetized plasma is created , the electrical permittivity of the medium filling the chamber is no longer homogeneous and no longer electrically isotropous .",
    "a detailed investigation has been carried out to demonstrate that the performance of ecr ion sources depends on the electromagnetic field excited inside the plasma chamber and on the coupling mechanism used to provide the microwaves to the plasma . in the following ,",
    "the various approaches used over the years are presented , together with the possible alternative heating schemes .",
    "up to now , the so - called ` ecris standard model ' has , for the greater part of a decade , been the road map followed by ecris designers .",
    "the main rules were confirmed by experiments performed at msu - nscl in 19934 and 1995 , and can be summarized as follows @xcite :    * the radial magnetic field value at the plasma chamber wall must be @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 ; * the axial magnetic field value at injection must be @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 or more ; * the axial magnetic field value at extraction must be about @xmath7 @xmath5 @xmath1 ; * the minimum value of the axial magnetic field must be in the range @xmath8 ; and * the optimum power must increase with the volume of the plasma and with the square of the frequency .    up to now",
    ", almost every operating ecris has complied with the standard model : the extracted current increases as the microwave frequency increases , but only an increase in the mirror ratio can exploit the optimal performance , making the increase of the electron density with frequency effective . also , according to the standard model , the development of the ecris is strictly linked to improvements in superconducting magnets and in the technology of microwave generation .",
    "various authors have studied the rf coupling to the plasma in terms of the maximum power rate per unit volume and its relationship with the beam intensity produced by different ecr ion sources @xcite , but this description is not satisfactory .",
    "the cavity design , and the microwave injection geometry , are of primary importance for high - rf - energy transmission to the plasma chamber .",
    "note that the problem of wave energy transmission into the plasma must be divided into two parts : the first is related to the microwave generator ",
    "waveguide  plasma chamber coupling , while the second concerns the wave  plasma interaction .",
    "both of these two aspects play notable roles for the future improvement of ecris performance .",
    "many experiments have been undertaken outside the framework traced by the standard model , to verify the possibility of improving the plasma heating .",
    "principally , they follow three different road maps .",
    "a first series of experiments has been devoted to the study of the variation of ecris performance with slight variations of the microwave frequency .",
    "the second route regards the possibility of operating with more than one frequency for plasma heating ( usually two ) or of using broad microwave spectra .",
    "the third method is actually a mixture of the previous ones : two or more frequencies are used for plasma heating , but at least one is provided by a broadband microwave generator ( such as a travelling - wave tube , or twt ) , which allows the effects of frequency tuning and of multi - frequency heating to be combined .      in order to characterize the electromagnetic field that is present inside the plasma chamber of an ecr ion source and where the particle motion occurs",
    ", it is fundamental to make the following assumption : the plasma chamber is a resonating cavity for the electromagnetic wave feeding the plasma .",
    "the coupling between the electromagnetic wave and the plasma - filled chamber and the electromagnetic field patterns that can be excited inside the resonating cavity are of primary importance for the characterization and for the properties of the plasma .",
    "furthermore , the characterization of the plasma chamber in terms of the excitable electromagnetic field allows us to make some assumptions about the charged particle motion and energy , as described in the following sections .",
    "a plasma chamber can be represented , in a first - order approximation , by a cylinder of radius _ a _ and length _",
    ", filled by a medium with a certain electric permittivity @xmath9 and a certain magnetic permeability @xmath10 .",
    "then , a discrete number of electromagnetic field patterns can exist inside the plasma chamber : the so - called resonant modes . they can be defined by the following equations , defined using a system of cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath11,@xmath12,@xmath13 ) : @xmath14    these are the equations describing the transverse magnetic ( tm ) modes , with only the magnetic field components on the transverse plane .",
    "the transverse electric ( te ) modes , with only the electric field components on the transverse plane , can be calculated using the following equations : @xmath15 here , the time dependence @xmath16 is omitted ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are , respectively , the bessel functions and the derivatives of the bessel functions of order @xmath19 ; and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are their related @xmath22 roots .",
    "a discrete set of frequencies @xmath23/2@xmath24 can exist inside the resonance cavity and they are defined as follows :    @xmath25    where the value @xmath26 is as follows : @xmath27 then , the resonant modes te@xmath28 and tm@xmath28 that exist inside the plasma chamber are identified by the mode parameters and their strength is related to the amplitude associated with the field strength of the wave . by supposing that the chamber is filled with a homogeneous and unmagnetized medium , the corresponding electrical permittivity is given by the relation @xmath29 where @xmath23 is the pulsation generating the plasma and @xmath30 is the plasma pulsation : @xmath31 in which @xmath32 and @xmath33 are , respectively ,",
    "the electron mass and the electron charge , @xmath34 is the electrical permittivity in vacuum , and @xmath35 is the electron density .",
    "therefore , under these hypotheses , the plasma build - up can be seen as a change in the electrical permittivity and therefore as a change in the resonant frequencies , because of the change of @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : omega ] ) .",
    "this model is certainly oversimplified if we consider the plasma of an ecr ion source , but has been applied successfully , giving information on the plasma parameters generated in a small reactor at infn - lns .",
    "since 1994 , the so - called two - frequency heating ( tfh ) has been used @xcite to improve the hci production by feeding the plasma with two electromagnetic waves at different frequencies instead of one . in some cases ,",
    "even three or more close frequencies have been used .",
    "the performance of the lbl aecr source has been improved by simultaneously heating the plasma with microwaves of 10 and 14 ghz .",
    "the plasma stability was improved and the ion charge - state distribution was shifted to a higher - charge state .",
    "the production of high - charge - state ions was increased by a factor of between 2 and 5 , or higher , for the very heavy ions such as bismuth and uranium , as compared to the case of single - frequency ( 14 ghz ) heating @xcite .    in an ecr source , electron cyclotron resonance heating couples microwave power into the plasma electrons .",
    "this occurs when the microwave frequency @xmath36 matches the cyclotron frequency , @xmath37 , of the electrons . in high - charge - state ecr sources with one frequency , the geometry of the minimum-@xmath0 field results in a closed , approximately ellipsoidal ecr surface .",
    "the electrons are heated in a thin resonance zone at the surface , as they spiral back and forth between the magnetic mirrors .",
    "when two frequencies are used , it is possible to produce two concentric surfaces , the physical separation of which depends on the frequency difference and the strength and gradient of the magnetic field , leading to a higher density of the energetic electrons . with tfh ,",
    "the ecr plasma is more quiescent than with single - frequency heating .",
    "both the short - term and the long - term plasma stability are improved , and more microwave power could be launched into the plasma .",
    "tfh has been demonstrated to be a powerful method : in the case in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath38u , it increased the production of higher - charge states ( from 35 + to 39 + ) by a factor ranging from 2 to 4 and shifted the peak charge state from 33 + to 36 + .",
    "two - frequency heating using 10 and 14 ghz in the aecr provided significantly better performance and indicated that still higher performance with multiple - frequency heating may be possible .",
    "while multiple - frequency heating would increase the complexity and cost of an ecr source , it could provide significant gains in performance . in @xcite , the performance of the argonne ecr ion source",
    "was improved through the use of tfh , with the primary frequency of 14 ghz from a klystron and the second frequency from a travelling - wave tube amplifier ( twta ) with a tunable range of 11.013.0 ghz .",
    "source output as well as stability were improved , with a shift to higher - charge states observed .",
    "the use of a second frequency increased the intensity of the medium charge states by 50100@xmath39 and the higher - charge states by a factor of between 2 and 5 . in a modern second - generation ecris , tfh",
    "is usually implemented by using frequencies between 14 and 18 ghz , while the best - performing ecris use a combination of 24 or 28 ghz with 18 ghz .",
    "microwaves of various frequencies can be simultaneously launched into and absorbed by a high - charge - state ecr plasma",
    ". the minimum-@xmath0 magnetic field configuration in an ecris can provide many closed and nested ecr heating surfaces , as graphically shown in fig .",
    "if two or more significantly different frequencies are used , two or more well - separated and nested ecr surfaces will exist in the ecr plasma . with the multiple ecr surfaces",
    ", electrons can be heated four times or more for one pass from one mirror end to the other , whereas they are only heated twice in the case of single - frequency heating .",
    "multiple - frequency heating can couple more microwave power with better efficiency into the plasma and it leads to a higher density of hot electrons , which is essential for the production of highly charged ions . to demonstrate that the frequency - domain technique can be used to enhance the performance of a traditional minimum-@xmath0 ecr ion source",
    ", comparative studies have been undertaken to assess the relative performance of the oak ridge national laboratory caprice ecr ion source @xcite , in terms of its multiply charged ion - beam generation capability , when excited with high - power , single - frequency , or multiple - discrete - frequency microwave radiation , derived from standard klystron and/or twt technologies .",
    "these studies demonstrate that the charge - state populations for ar@xmath40 and xe@xmath41move towards higher values when excited with two- and three - discrete - frequency microwave power compared to those observed when single - frequency microwave power is used . for example , the most probable charge state for xe is increased by one charge - state unit , while the beam intensities for charge states higher than the most probable one are increased by factors of @xmath42 compared to those observed for single - frequency plasma excitation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , particle - in - cell codes have been used to simulate the magnetic field distributions , to demonstrate the advantages of using multiple , discrete frequencies over single frequencies to power conventional ecr ion sources .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    one , two and three - frequency heating experiments have been conducted using xe feed gas . with the addition of the second and third frequencies , the most probable xe@xmath40 charge state moves towards higher values by one unit ;",
    "this clearly illustrates that the performance of conventional - geometry ecr ion sources can be significantly improved by the use of multiple - discrete - frequency plasma heating .",
    "the ionization process in electron cyclotron resonance ( ecr ) ion sources is based on the sequential removal of electrons in collisions between ions or neutral atoms with electrons that have been heated stochastically to high energies by the adsorption of microwave power under ecr conditions .",
    "the ecr zones in a conventional minimum-@xmath0 geometry ecris , powered by narrow - bandwidth microwave radiation , are thin volumes that are substantially smaller in relation to their total plasma volumes .",
    "consequently , the probability of an acceleration resulting in a substantial energy gain for the electrons that arrive in the ecr zone in phase with the electric field vector of the electromagnetic wave is lower than is possible in extended - volume ecr zones",
    ". therefore , it is reasonable to believe that the performance of conventional minimum-@xmath0 ecr ion sources can be improved by increasing their respective resonance volumes .",
    "the volume effect has been demonstrated by tailoring the central magnetic field so that it forms a large resonant volume and by increasing the number of discrete operational frequencies of the ion source .",
    "broadband sources of rf power provide a simple and potentially more effective alternative for increasing the physical sizes of the resonance zones in conventional @xmath43 ecr ion sources .",
    "some experiments have been performed with the jyfl 6.4 ghz conventional minimum-@xmath0 geometry ecr ion source at the university of jyvskyl , using ar as the feed gas .",
    "the performance of the source was compared when operated with either narrow or with broadband microwave radiation , under the same neutral gas pressure and input power conditions . for the narrow - bandwidth experiments ,",
    "the carrier signal from the local oscillator ( lo , bandwidth 1.5 mhz ) was fed directly into the twta . for the broadband experiments ,",
    "the signal from the lo was fed into a white - noise generator ( wng ) , producing an output signal with a bandwidth of 200 mhz , fwhm , equally distributed about the central frequency of the lo ( 6.4 ghz ) .",
    "the measurements were carried out at the same absorbed microwave power level ( 200 w ) , determined by subtracting the reflected power from the forward power of the twta .",
    "the input power was limited due to impedance mismatch of certain frequencies in the amplified broadband signal , resulting in 20@xmath39 reflected power of the injected power .",
    "this problem can not be avoided and it constitutes the main drawback of such a technique , since frequencies are differently coupled into the ion source depending on the intrinsic electromagnetic structure of the source itself . in the case of narrow- bandwidth operation ,",
    "the reflected power was typically 6@xmath39 .",
    "for the wng mode of operation at optimum pressure , the ion plasma density , as evaluated from the measured drain current and the charge - state distribution , using bohm s criterion , was within 15@xmath39 of the neutral density .",
    "although the beam intensities were higher by factors > 2 with the wng at low pressures , there was no difference between the broadband and narrow - bandwidth modes of operation in the high neutral pressure regime due to increased rates of charge exchange @xcite .",
    "enlarged ecr zones improve the production of high - charge - state ions due to enhanced bombardment with higher populations of energetic electrons and , especially , due to the enhanced ionization rates of neutrals in the ecr zone , thereby lowering the probability of charge - exchange collisions .",
    "the tremendous potential of the broadband technique for enhancing high - charge - state beam intensities over conventional means at equivalent input power levels is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ broad ] , where the ratio of wn / lo - generated high - charge - state beams is seen to increase continually with the charge state .",
    "clearly , the potential of the broadband method can only be fully evaluated by comparing the high charge states produced with the two modes of operation at the same power density , if this is achievable in practice in terms of the operational limitations imposed by outgassing effects and the required rf power .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the performance of ecr ion sources can also be significantly improved by tailoring the central region of the magnetic field so that it is resonant with single - frequency microwave radiation ( spatial domain ) @xcite .",
    "the spatial - domain technique employs a magnetic field configuration with an extended central flat region , tuned to be in resonance with single - frequency microwave radiation .",
    "because of the large resonant plasma volume , significantly more rf power can be coupled into the plasma , resulting in heating of electrons over a much larger volume than is possible in conventional ecr ion sources .",
    "the ability to ionize a larger fraction of the particles in the plasma volume effectively reduces the probability of resonant and non - resonant charge exchange , thereby increasing the residence time of an ion in a given charge state and for subsequent and further ionization .",
    "all other parameters being equal , the ` volume ' ecr source should result in higher - charge - state distributions , higher beam intensities , and improved operational stability .",
    "the axial magnetic field is shown in fig .",
    "[ bflat ] : its profile is flat ( constant mod-@xmath0 ) in the centre , and extends over the length of the central field region , along the axis of symmetry , and radially outwards to form a uniformly distributed ecr plasma ` volume ' .",
    "this magnetic field design strongly contrasts with those used in conventional ecr ion sources , where the central field regions are approximately parabolic and the consequent ecr zones are ` surfaces ' .",
    "configurations in ` surface ' ( dotted line ) ecr ion sources @xcite .",
    "[ bflat],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    according to computational studies , the new configuration will result in dramatic increases in the absorption of rf power , thus enabling the heating of electrons over a much larger volume , thereby increasing the electron temperature and the ` hot ' electron population in the plasma .",
    "many experiments over recent years have shown that significant improvements of ecris performance ( both in terms of total extracted current and the production of highly charged ions ) can be obtained by slightly varying the microwave frequency in the case of single - frequency heating ( sfh ) , this being defined as a ` frequency tuning ' effect .",
    "it was already known that a large increase in the frequency increases ( @xmath44ghz ) the electron density and improves the ecris performance because of the increase of the cut - off density , but since 2001 several experiments have demonstrated that even slight variations of the pumping wave frequency ( @xmath44mhz ) may lead to strong variations in the extracted current .",
    "the first evidence was provided by the different performances observed for the serse and caesar ion sources when fed by a klystron - based or a twt - based generator @xcite at either 14 or 18 ghz .",
    "other interesting results came from experiments performed at gsi and at jyfl . in frequency tuning , the microwave frequency is varied in order to select the most efficient heating mode inside the plasma chamber of the ecris . in the experiments , the input frequency for the klystron",
    "was swept from 14.05 to 14.13 ghz in 100 s , using a rohde @xmath45 schwartz signal generator .",
    "this bandwidth was found adequate to maintain a constant output power over the whole frequency sweep , using the automatic level control feature of the klystron .",
    "the beam emittance and the beam structure were studied as a function of the frequency with the aid of an allison - type emittance scanner and a kbr beam viewer .",
    "figure [ emitt ] shows three beam viewer pictures : the beam structure varies strongly with the microwave frequency , as an indication of the change in the plasma  wave coupling during the scan .",
    "however , no unequivocal explanation concerning the origin of the beam structure variations can be given : they could originate from the changes in the plasma , in the electron ion dynamics , due to electromagnetic field variations and/or in the beam line due to changes in ion - beam intensity and space charge .",
    "the explanation of the data presented above is based on the assumption that the frequency tuning changes the electromagnetic field distribution inside the resonator in terms of its distribution over the resonance surface ; that is , where the wave  electron energy transfer takes place .",
    "this assumption requires that even in case of plasma filling the cavity , the resonant modes persist ; that is , the formation of standing waves is still possible .",

    "the experimental set - up uses a microwave sweep generator that feeds a twta , covering a wide frequency range from 8 to 18 ghz .",
    "this arrangement provides a precise determination of the frequencies and of the reflection coefficient along with the beam properties .",
    "a sequence of viewing targets positioned inside the beam line monitors the evolution of the beam shape . in the present experiment",
    ", the frequency tuning effect has been analysed in the 12.516.5 ghz frequency range . the availability of a twta driven by a signal generator made it possible to change the source operating frequency in steps of a few hundred kilohertz .",
    "this experiment allows us to analyse the beam properties when the ecris operative frequency sweeps over a wide range of 4 ghz , and hence for increasing ecr surfaces .",
    "the influence on lower- and higher - charge states has been analysed for different source conditions concerning the magnetic field configuration , the gas pressure , and the power setting .",

    "the input of the amplifier was driven by a signal generator able to sweep from 1 to 20 ghz . according to the maximum manageable power reflected to the amplifier , it has been restricted to working at a power of 100 w and in the frequency range of 12.516.5 ghz .",
    "the use of a waveguide microwave isolator covering this frequency range and handling up to 650 w could allow us to work with higher powers .",

[ csd ] , the charge - state distributions are presented for four different frequencies .    , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the 14.5 ghz value is the normal operational frequency of the caprice ion source ; 14.46 ghz and 14.119 ghz are the frequencies at which the minimum and the maximum ar@xmath48 currents , respectively , were measured in the 1415 ghz frequency range .",
    "the charge - state distribution related to 14.0 ghz operation is also reported in order to emphasize the importance of the electromagnetic field pattern and the choice of the frequency .",

[ broad ] ) was @xmath52 db and more than half of the power was reflected ; and in the second case it was @xmath53 db , the impedance matching condition was fulfilled , and hardly any power was reflected .",
    "it is also interesting that for the frequencies at which the higher - charge states are favoured , the current of the lower charge state is decreasing and vice versa .",

    "the relationship between the two frequencies and the respective power was not univocally determined .",
    "in fact , any source features a different set of parameters and the optimization is done empirically , just by looking at the maximization of the beam current .",
    "several qualitative explanations have been offered for this phenomenon , all related to the increase of the average electron temperature , t@xmath55 , and to the ionization rate , by assuming that the crossing of two resonance surfaces helps the electrons to gain more energy .",
    "this simple picture does not explain the reason for the relevant changes in the charge - state distribution for different pairs of frequencies ( even for the case of minor changes  such as a few megahertz over 14 or 18 ghz ) , which can be explained nowadays in terms of the frequency tuning effect .",
    "it is important to underline that , even in the case of tfh applied to many existing sources , a twt is often used , the other option being a klystron - based generator .",
    "the choice of a twt allows the experimentalists to vary the second frequency slightly .",
    "it has been observed  for example , for the production of o@xmath47  that 60 w emitted by the twt at the optimum frequency gives the same effect as 300 w emitted from the fixed - frequency klystron .",
    "the maximum current is obtained by means of a klystron at 427 w and a twt at 62 w ( @xmath56 = 66 @xmath10a ) , operating simultaneously ; in order to obtain the same current , the experimenters needed @xmath57 = 800 w from the klystron in sfh . furthermore , in the case of tfh , the current increases almost 20@xmath39 ( from 57 to 66 @xmath10ea ) when the twt - emitted frequency shifts from 11.06 to 10.85 ghz , the klystron and twt emitted power both being held constant . then , the tfh is an effective method to increase the extracted current from an ecris , but it can only be fully exploited by means of frequency tuning .",
    "several measurements have been carried out with the serse ion source .",
    "the tfh has been used for operation at either 14 or 18 ghz , with a clear advantage with respect to sfh .    in section [ mic ] , the evolution of the ion current intensities of ar@xmath47 , ar@xmath48 , and ar@xmath49 over the 12.516.5 ghz frequency range has been described .",
    "the argon charge - state distributions were analysed for different frequencies , and for some frequencies an enhanced intensity of the higher - charge states was observed .",
    "we decided to perform an experiment to investigate the double - frequency heating effect using a single fixed frequency ( 14.5 ghz in one case and 14.119 ghz in another ) and a second frequency swept over the 12.516.5 ghz range .",
    "first , the power feeding the plasma was kept at 100 w , in order to compare the results of double - frequency heating with single - frequency sweeping .",
    "then the power distribution between the fixed frequency and the sweeping frequency was unbalanced by doubling the power of the fixed frequency in one case and the power of the sweeping frequency in the other .",
    "the ion source parameters  including the magnetic field , the gas pressure , the extraction voltage , and so on  were set to and maintained at the same values as used for single - frequency sweep analysis , with the charge - state distribution optimized for the ar@xmath48 intensity .",
    "the ar@xmath47 , ar@xmath48 , and ar@xmath49 currents were recorded together with the extractor drain current .",
    "the forward power and the reflected power were measured simultaneously . however , in the case of double - frequency heating , the power probes can not distinguish the measured values of the forward and reflected power related to each of the two waves .",
    "the results of these measurements are shown in fig .",
    "[ dfh ] .    ,",
    "scaledwidth=50.0% ]    a comparison between the two techniques concerning the behaviour of the ion source is possible . as expected , in the case of the two frequencies , the minima of the reflection coefficient are higher because of the higher level of reflected power due to the superposition of the two waves .",
    "it is interesting to note that these minima occur at almost the same frequencies for both techniques .",
    "since the positions of the reflection coefficient minima do not vary , it can be expected that the peaks of the ion current are located at the same frequencies for the two heating methods .",
    "this comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ drain ] for the drain current of the high - voltage extractor power supply . in this case , 50 w is provided at one fixed frequency and the effect of sweeping a second frequency with a power of 50 w produces a different current behaviour from that with a single sweeping frequency ( at the same power ) .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ drain ] and figs .",

    "the drain current appears more stable with frequency when the double frequency is applied instead of single - frequency tuning .",
    "this behaviour is also observed in the ar@xmath47 current variation shown in fig .",
    "[ artf ] . a possible explanation might be found in the microwave power provided by the two methods . in the case of single - frequency tuning ,",
    "100 w is provided to the source and during the frequency sweep , when the impedance is not matched , most of the forward power is not coupled to the source but is reflected ( see fig . [ dfh ] ) .",
    "but in the case of double - frequency heating , just 50 w of the total forward power of 100 w is associated with the sweeping frequency , and at the frequencies at which the power is not coupled to the plasma , one half of the total power is provided at a fixed frequency , which is well coupled to the source ( i.e. at 14.5 ghz or at an optimized frequency such as 14.119 ghz ) .",
    "the choice of the fixed frequency allows enhancement of the ion currents of the higher - charge states . with respect to single - frequency operation , with two frequencies",
    "the current peaks are broadened and reduced in amplitude , the frequencies at which they occur remain the same , and the average current level remains high ( see fig .",

    "[ ar9f ] and [ ar8f ] ) .",
    "the experimental results indicate that there can be strong differences when the operating frequency is optimized by frequency tuning .",
    "in fact , when operating in double - frequency mode and optimizing one of the two frequencies ( 14.119 ghz for the present case , as described above ) , the current increases linearly with frequency ( with respect to the 14.5 ghz fixed frequency ) .",
    "current as a function of frequency : a comparison between the frequency tuning effect and double - frequency heating.[ar8f],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in comparing the two techniques while keeping the ion source settings and the microwave power constant , note that the behaviour of the ion currents and the reflection coefficient remain almost the same with frequency .",
    "this result is useful to optimize the performance of an ecris further when double - frequency heating is used .",
    "in fact , single - frequency tuning can be used to find the optimum frequencies to be used for operating in the multiple heating mode .",
    "note also that when operating with two generators set at the same frequency , the current level measured is different from the single - generator case .",
    "this is because when the two frequencies become equal , the current of each charge state and the power provided to the ion source are not stable .",
    "a possible explanation for this phenomenon might be overlapping of the two signals and the phase difference between the two waves .",
    "we plan to explore the use of two phase - locked generators in forthcoming experiments .",
    "the behaviour of argon ion beams has been explored for different power levels of the fixed frequency and the sweep frequency . in both cases ,",
    "two fixed frequencies were chosen and in this case the possibility of setting the fixed frequency to an optimized value , obtained by fine - tuning the frequency , allowed us to increase the beam intensity ( fig .",

    "again , the single - frequency sweep carried out at 100 w is included in the figure for comparison .",
    "for the optimum frequency mentioned previously ( 14.119 ghz ) , the current intensity is still comparable between the two methods even though the total power is 50@xmath39 greater .",
    "when the power associated with the fixed frequency is higher , all the analysed charge states are less sensitive to variation of the second frequency .",
    "this follows from the reduced dynamic range of the current , indicating a more stable plasma ; in particular , when the fixed frequency is chosen to be at the optimum value ( 14.119 ghz ) .",
    "furthermore , when one of the two frequencies is optimized , the average extracted current remains high with respect to an unoptimized frequency ( such as 14.5 ghz ) , increasing with the second frequency ( quite evident above 15 ghz ) .",
