    "we describe colorful polytope versions of two well - known convex polytopes , the associahedron and the cyclohedron .",
    "the associahedron is a simple convex polytope first described combinatorially by stasheff  @xcite in 1963 .",

    "the ordinary associahedron and cyclohedron can be constructed as convex polytopes that encode triangulations and flips .",
    "their colorful polytope versions , the colorful associahedron and colorful cyclohedron , respectively , are abstract polytopes that similarly encode triangulations and flips , but now with the new feature that the diagonals of the triangulations are colored and adjacency of triangulations requires color preserving flips",

    "let @xmath1 be a finite simple graph ( without loops or multiple edges ) , and let @xmath3 denote its vertex set and @xmath4 its edge set .",
    "an _ edge coloring _ of @xmath1 is an assignment of colors to the edges of @xmath1 such that adjacent edges are colored differently ; this is an _ @xmath0-edge coloring _ if @xmath0 colors are used .",
    "the minimum number @xmath0 for which @xmath1 admits an @xmath0-edge coloring is called its _ chromatic index _ and is denoted by @xmath5 .",

    "we are mainly interested in connected @xmath0-regular graphs @xmath1 of the first type , that is , graphs with @xmath11 .",
    "any such ( @xmath0-regular ) graph , equipped with an @xmath0-edge coloring , is called a _",
    "properly edge colored graph_.    an automorphism of a finite simple ( uncolored ) graph @xmath1 is a permutation of the vertices of @xmath1 that preserves the edges of @xmath1 . by @xmath12",

    "( this is a digression from @xcite . )",
    "now suppose @xmath1 is a properly edge colored graph and @xmath13 the underlying edge coloring map , where @xmath14 is the set of colors used . an automorphism @xmath15 is called _ color preserving _ if @xmath16 preserves the color of every edge of @xmath1 ; that is , @xmath17 for every edge @xmath18 of @xmath1 .",

    "now let @xmath74 and @xmath115 be two vertices of @xmath98 .",
    "clearly , since the uncolored graph @xmath84 is connected , we can find an edge path in @xmath84 that joins @xmath96 and @xmath116 .",
    "the edges in this path correspond to flips of diagonals in uncolored triangulations .",
    "when the very same flips are performed on the corresponding colored triangulation @xmath74 and its successors to give an edge path in @xmath98 , we see that the original vertex @xmath74 of @xmath98 can be joined in @xmath98 to a new vertex with support @xmath116 .",
    "this new vertex will generally be different from @xmath115 but does have the same support as @xmath115 .",
    "these arguments show that we may assume from now on that @xmath74 and @xmath115 have the same support .",
    "now suppose @xmath74 and @xmath115 have the same underlying triangulation but possibly different colorings of the diagonals .",
    "identifying the @xmath94 possible colorings on this triangulation with the elements of the symmetric group @xmath117 , and using the fact that @xmath117 is generated by transpositions , we see that any coloring can be moved into any other coloring by successively switching exactly two colors at a time . if we can realize any such switch of two colors by a path between vertices in @xmath98 , then the concatenation of these paths in @xmath98 gives a path joining @xmath74 and  @xmath115 .",
    "hence it suffices to assume from now on that @xmath74 and @xmath115 have the same support and that their colorings differ in only two positions , namely in the colors of the diagonals @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( say ) of @xmath120 .",

    "note here that @xmath111 . by induction applied to the graph @xmath125 for @xmath122 , we can connect the two corresponding vertices @xmath123 and @xmath124 by an edge path in @xmath125 .",
    "now , if we append to each triangulation in this path the triangle that had been cut off from @xmath72 at @xmath27 , we obtain an edge path in the original graph @xmath126 joining @xmath74 and @xmath115 .",
    "thus the vertices @xmath74 and @xmath115 can be connected in  @xmath126 .",
    "it remains to consider the case when both @xmath118 and @xmath119 are short diagonals of @xmath96 .",
    "now bear in mind that @xmath111 . in the special case",
    "when @xmath127 and @xmath96 is a triangulation of the hexagon with only short diagonals , we can directly appeal to figure  [ exchange2 ] to see that @xmath74 and @xmath115 are connected in  @xmath126 ; in fact , truncating the hexagon by the diagonal of @xmath96 distinct from @xmath118 and @xmath119 results in a pentagon with two induced colored triangulations connected in @xmath128 . in all other instances",
    "there is at least one long diagonal , @xmath129 ( say ) , in @xmath96 , and so we can first switch the colors on @xmath118 and @xmath129 , then on @xmath129 and @xmath119 , and finally again on @xmath118 and @xmath129 . by the previous case , each switch",
    "can be realized by an edge path between the corresponding vertices of @xmath126 .",
    "hence the concatenated paths give an edge path joining @xmath74 and @xmath115 in @xmath126 .",
    "thus @xmath126 is connected .",
    "the two previous lemmas show that @xmath126 is a connected properly edge - colored @xmath0-regular graph .",

    "when @xmath105 ( and @xmath318 is a centrally symmetric octagon ) , the colorful @xmath89-cyclohedron @xmath338 ( of rank @xmath89 ) is a trivalent map on the @xmath87-torus with @xmath339  vertices , @xmath340 edges and @xmath341 facets .    for @xmath342",
    ", a typical @xmath27-face @xmath40 of the colorful @xmath77-cyclohedron @xmath336 can be represented as a pair @xmath134 , where @xmath74 is a vertex of @xmath343 ( a triangulation of @xmath318 ) and @xmath60 is a @xmath27-subset of the new @xmath77-element color set @xmath344 , with the understanding that the vertex - set of @xmath40 in @xmath336 consists of all vertices representing centrally symmetric triangulations of @xmath318 obtained from @xmath74 by a sequence of flips involving only diagonals with colors from @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath134 is a facet ( face of rank @xmath0 ) of @xmath336 , the corresponding @xmath0-subset @xmath60 contains all colors in @xmath345 , except one , called the _ missing color _ of the facet .",
    "a diagonal of @xmath74 carrying the missing color of a facet @xmath134 is called a _",
    "rigid _ diagonal of this facet .",
    "flips involved in generating the facet can only be performed on diagonals which are not rigid .",
    "a facet has one or two rigid diagonals , depending on whether or not the missing color is @xmath334 .",
    "if there is just one rigid diagonal , then the diagonal of @xmath318 underlying this rigid diagonal is a central diagonal of @xmath318 . on the other hand ,",
    "if there are two rigid diagonals , then the two diagonals of @xmath318 underlying these rigid diagonals form a centrally symmetric pair of non - central diagonals of @xmath318 . in short",
    ", a facet has either a central rigid diagonal or one centrally symmetric pair of non - central rigid diagonals .    among the facets with central rigid diagonals ,",
    "a facet is uniquely determined by its rigid diagonal . however , among the facets with a centrally symmetric pair of non - central rigid diagonals , a facet is not generally determined by its pair of rigid diagonals ( when @xmath346 ) .",
    "in fact , the diagonal pair dissects @xmath318 into three regions , and flips involving non - rigid diagonals must preserve this dissection , preventing colors to move between regions .",
    "thus a facet with a centrally symmetric pair of non - central rigid diagonals also depends on how the color set is partitioned among the regions ( of course , the regions not containing the center of @xmath318 must receive the same colors ) .",
    "note that , since @xmath318 has @xmath347 edges and @xmath294 central diagonals ( colorable only with @xmath334 ) , @xmath318 has @xmath348 non - central diagonals and therefore @xmath349 centrally symmetric pairs of non - central diagonals , each colorable with @xmath0 possible colors from @xmath321 .",
    "the @xmath294 facets of @xmath336 with a central rigid diagonal are isomorphic to the colorful @xmath0-associahedron @xmath69 .",
    "in fact , a central diagonal divides @xmath318 into two halves , each an @xmath70-gon , and the centrally symmetric triangulations of @xmath318 with this central diagonal as diagonal are in one - to - one correspondence with the ordinary triangulations in one of these @xmath70-gons .",
    "note that these @xmath294 facets partition the entire vertex - set of @xmath336 .",
    "we let @xmath350 denote the facet of @xmath336 with central rigid diagonal @xmath80 .    on the other hand , when @xmath351 the facets of @xmath336 with a centrally symmetric pair of non - central rigid diagonals are not isomorphic to @xmath69 , as can be seen as follows .",
    "( when @xmath103 the facets have rank @xmath2 and are trivially isomorphic to @xmath69 . ) suppose the diagonal pair dissects @xmath318 into three regions such that the central region @xmath352 is a @xmath353-gon .",
    "there are two cases to consider .",
    "first , if @xmath354 then the corresponding facet of @xmath336 must contain a @xmath87-face isomorphic to @xmath355 , that is , a hexagon ; in fact , take a centrally symmetric hexagon @xmath356 with center @xmath319 and vertices among those of @xmath352 , triangulate the complements of @xmath356 in @xmath352 and of @xmath352 in @xmath318 in a centrally symmetric fashion , and then allow only the diagonals of @xmath356 to flip , thus creating a @xmath87-face of @xmath336 based on @xmath356 and hence isomorphic to @xmath355 . however , as we saw earlier , @xmath69 has only squares and decagons as @xmath87-faces , so the facet of @xmath336 determined by the given diagonal pair can not be isomorphic to @xmath69 .",
    "this then leaves the case @xmath357 . in this case",
    "the central region @xmath352 is a square , so a simple vertex count shows that the corresponding facet of @xmath336 can not be isomorphic to @xmath69 ; in fact , the number of vertices in the facet is just twice that of the colorful @xmath52-associahedron @xmath219 , and hence equals the number of vertices of the colorful @xmath0-associahedron @xmath358 only when @xmath103 .",
    "this settles our claim .    as in the case of the colorful associahedron ,",
    "the symmetric group @xmath117 on the @xmath0 colors ( not including @xmath334 ) acts as a group of automorphisms on @xmath336 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath359 denotes the ordinary cyclohedron , then very similar considerations as before establish                first note that @xmath367 acts in an obvious way on @xmath336 .",
    "however , since the central inversion @xmath368 of @xmath318 acts trivially on @xmath336 , the subgroup of @xmath369 induced by @xmath370 is isomorphic to @xmath371 and thus will be denoted by @xmath372 .",
    "hence , since the two subgroups @xmath372 and @xmath117 of @xmath369 centralize each other , @xmath369 must necessarily contain a subgroup isomorphic to @xmath373 .",
    "it remains to show that this is the full group .",
    "now suppose @xmath374 .",
    "consider the @xmath294 ( mutually isomorphic ) facets @xmath350 of @xmath336 with central rigid diagonals @xmath80 .",
    "these facets are permuted under automorphisms of @xmath336 ; in fact , by our previous considerations , since @xmath351 they are the only facets of @xmath336 isomorphic to the colorful @xmath0-associahedron @xmath286 . in particular this",
    "applies to the automorphism @xmath16 .",
    "consider the central diagonal @xmath375 of @xmath318 , and let @xmath72 denote the @xmath70-gon with vertices @xmath200 cut off @xmath318 by @xmath18 .",
    "then @xmath376 is a facet of @xmath336 isomorphic to @xmath377 and hence must be determined by a central diagonal of @xmath318 .",
    "therefore , since @xmath370 acts transitively on the central diagonals of @xmath318 , we may assume that , modulo the subgroup @xmath372 of @xmath369 , this facet is @xmath377 itself ; that is , @xmath377 is stabilized by @xmath16 .",
    "it follows that @xmath16 ( or rather its restriction to @xmath377 ) must lie in the automorphism group of @xmath377 , which is isomorphic to @xmath378 .",
    "suppose @xmath379 with @xmath380 and @xmath381 .",
    "( here , @xmath382 and @xmath383 are automorphisms of the facet @xmath377 , but a priori not of @xmath336 itself . )",
    "each @xmath52-face @xmath42 of the facet @xmath377 is of the form @xmath384 , with @xmath74 a vertex of @xmath377 and @xmath385 for some @xmath386 .",
    "let @xmath387 denote the centrally symmetric pair of non - central diagonals of @xmath318 whose color in @xmath74 is @xmath388 .",
    "flips involved in generating @xmath42 can only be performed on diagonals distinct from @xmath389 , @xmath390 and @xmath18 .",
    "however , for reasons similar to those mentioned earlier , an @xmath52-face @xmath42 of @xmath377 is not generally determined by the diagonals @xmath387 and the color @xmath388 ; it also depends on the distribution of colors over the regions into which @xmath318 is dissected by @xmath389 , @xmath390 and @xmath18 .",
    "note that , up to relabeling , we may always assume that @xmath391 and @xmath392 for some @xmath221 and @xmath27 with @xmath393 .    by the diamond condition",
    ", each @xmath52-face @xmath42 of @xmath377 lies in exactly one other facet , @xmath394 ( say ) , of @xmath336 .",
    "let @xmath395 denote the family of all facets of @xmath336 distinct from @xmath377 which have an @xmath52-face in common with @xmath377 . as @xmath16 and @xmath383 leave @xmath377 invariant , they must necessarily permute the facets in @xmath395 .    for @xmath393 ,",
    "let @xmath396 denote the family of facets @xmath394 in @xmath395 with @xmath42 such that @xmath397",
    ". now observe that the facets in the families @xmath398 ( @xmath399 ) are isomorphic to colorful @xmath0-cyclohedra @xmath400 , while those in @xmath401 and @xmath402 are not .",
    "the combinatorial automorphism of @xmath72 inducing the automorphism @xmath383 of the facet @xmath377 naturally permutes the @xmath167 diagonals @xmath403 ( @xmath399 ) , @xmath404 and @xmath405 of @xmath318 , so @xmath383 must induce a permutation of the @xmath167 families @xmath398 ( @xmath399 ) , @xmath401 and @xmath402 . but",
    "automorphisms of polytopes take facets to isomorphic facets , so @xmath383 must either fix both families @xmath401 and @xmath402 , or interchange them . now ,",
    "if the families @xmath401 and @xmath402 are interchanged by @xmath383 , then the combinatorial automorphism of @xmath72 underlying @xmath383 is simply the combinatorial reflection @xmath406 on @xmath72 that takes @xmath18 to itself .      in the former case we know that @xmath16 is an automorphism of @xmath336 that acts on the facet @xmath377 like the element @xmath382 of @xmath117 ; in particular , @xmath16 maps colored triangulations in @xmath377 to colored triangulations in @xmath377 with the same support . as we remarked earlier , @xmath369 contains a subgroup isomorphic to @xmath117 obtained from the natural action of @xmath117 on @xmath336 .",
    "now let @xmath407 denote the element of this subgroup induced by the permutation on @xmath408 given by @xmath382 ; less formally , @xmath407 is induced by @xmath382 .",
    "then it is clear that @xmath409 is an automorphism of @xmath336 that fixes @xmath377 and acts on the entire facet @xmath377 like the identity .",
    "hence , since automorphisms of polytopes are determined by the effect on a flag , @xmath409 must in fact be the identity on @xmath336 .",
    "thus @xmath410 lies in the copy of @xmath117 inside @xmath369 .    in the latter case",
    "we can think of @xmath406 as the restriction to @xmath72 , of the combinatorial reflection @xmath411 of @xmath318 that interchanges the vertices of @xmath18 ( and leaves @xmath18 invariant ) .",
    "it follows that we can view @xmath383 as the automorphism induced on @xmath377 by the combinatorial automorphism @xmath411 of @xmath318 ( considered modulo @xmath368 ) .",
    "hence , by applying the automorphism of @xmath336 determined by @xmath411 we can reduce @xmath16 modulo @xmath372 to an automorphism of @xmath336 that acts on the facet @xmath377 like the element @xmath382 of @xmath117 .",
    "but now we can argue as in the previous case and conclude that @xmath16 lies in the subgroup @xmath117 of @xmath369 .",
