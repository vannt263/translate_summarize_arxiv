    "<S> tuning the entanglement can be achieved for one , two and three - dimensional arrangements of the qubits . </S>",
    "<S> the feasibility of building such an entanglement switch is also discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> entanglement is a quantum mechanical property that describes a correlation between quantum mechanical systems . </S>",
    "<S> it has no classical analog and has been lying in the heart of the foundation of quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the desire to understand , tune and manipulate quantum entanglement is of fundamental importance in the field of quantum information and computation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , we studied a set of localized spins coupled through exchange interaction and subject to an external magnetic filed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated for such a class of one - dimensional magnetic systems , that entanglement can be controlled and tuned by varying the anisotropy parameter in the hamiltonian and by introducing impurities into the systems@xcite . in this letter , we propose a new entanglement switch of qubits consisting of the electric dipole moment of diatomic polar molecules , oriented along or against an external electric field and coupled by the electric dipole - dipole interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> recent progress in methods for producing , trapping and controlling cold polar molecules make them an excellent candidate for quantum computation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> trapped polar molecules was proposed as a novel physical realization of a quantum computer by a number of authors @xcite . in this proposal , </S>",
    "<S> the qubits are the molecular electric dipole moments which can only orient along(@xmath0 ) or against ( @xmath1 ) the external electric fields . </S>",
    "<S> each qubit is one polar molecule with equal spacing along the axis . </S>",
    "<S> for such a system , tuning and controlling the entanglement between the dipoles is of great importance .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of n - trapped dipoles in an external electric field reads@xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 s are the dipole operators and related to pauli matrices , @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent dipole excitation and de - excitation , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 is the transition frequency of the dipole on site @xmath7 , which is a function of dipole moment and external electric fields at site @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the electric dipole moment which we assume the same for each site . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 is the dipole - dipole coupling constant between sites @xmath7 and @xmath11 , which is determined by the strength of dipole moment , the direction of the external electric field and the lattice constant of the dipole array . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the angle between @xmath14 and external electric field .    </S>",
    "<S> we will expand the hamiltonian in pure standard basis , @xmath15 , and all the eigenstates will be obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for @xmath16 , we obtained the following four eigenvectors : @xmath17 with corresponding eigenvalues : @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> for the ratio @xmath19 , @xmath20 is fully entangled ground state . however , for @xmath21 the non entangled state @xmath22 is the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have a curve crossing at @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> the concept of entanglement of formation is related to the amount of entanglement needed to prepare the state @xmath24 , where @xmath24 is the density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown by wootters @xcite that concurrence is a good measure of entanglement@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the concurrence c is given by @xcite @xmath25 for a general state of two qubits , @xmath26 s are the eigenvalues , in decreasing order , of the hermitian matrix @xmath27 where @xmath24 is the density matrix and @xmath28 is the spin - flipped state defined as @xmath29 where the @xmath30 is the complex conjugate of @xmath24 and is taken in the standard basis , which for a pair of 2 level particles is @xmath15 .    in order to calculate thermal entanglement </S>",
    "<S> , we need the temperature dependent density matrix and the density matrix for a system in equilibrium at a temperature t reads : @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the partition function , @xmath34 . in this case , the partition function is @xmath35 where @xmath26 is the @xmath7th eigenvalue and @xmath36 is the degeneracy . and </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding density matrix can be written : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the @xmath7th eigenfunction . </S>",
    "<S> for pairwise thermal entanglement , we can get reduced density matrix as a function of temperature in the same way , which leads to temperature dependent entanglement .    in figure 1 </S>",
    "<S> we show the tuning of the pairwise entanglement , measured by concurrence , of one - dimensional arrangements of the dipoles as one varies the ratio @xmath39 at different temperatures for @xmath40 dipoles . here </S>",
    "<S> we took all transition frequencies to be the same , @xmath41 and the nearest neighbor dipole - dipole interaction to be the same , @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> all other dipole - dipole coupling constants @xmath43 can be expressed in terms of @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have two parameters to vary , the ratio @xmath39 and temperature @xmath45 . at @xmath46 one </S>",
    "<S> has a constant entanglement over a long ratio @xmath39 and sharp transitions or jumps to lower values at other values of @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that for @xmath47 , entanglement is only between dipole 1 and 2 . for @xmath48 dipole </S>",
    "<S> one becomes entangled also with dipole 3 and with other dipoles until we reach @xmath49 , above this value the concurrence is zero between all sites . </S>",
    "<S> as one increase the temperature , the curve become smoother as mixing occur with higher states . </S>",
    "<S> calculations for @xmath50 gave similar behavior of tuning and controlling entanglement as for the case @xmath40 . to show how the populations changes at the transition point , we present in figure 2 the coefficients of the wave function for @xmath51 before and after the transition point @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath53 , the ground state wave function is @xmath54 , however , when @xmath55 , the ground state wave function becomes @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> figures 3 and 4 show a similar phenomena for two and three - dimensional arrangements of the dipoles . </S>",
    "<S> the pairwise entanglement decreases as one increases the dimensionality of the system and the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> + there have been rapid advances made recently in cooling , trapping and manipulating atomic ( rydberg)@xcite and molecular dipoles@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a wide variety of ground state polar molecules with large electric dipole moments ( several debyes , where 1 debye @xmath57 3.3 @xmath58 @xmath59 ) ( @xmath57 mk or below ) regime , some even near quantum degeneracy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these developments provide exciting opportunities to experimentally realize the entanglement switch described above , which requires tuning @xmath39 around 1 , and cooling the dipoles to temperatures ( @xmath60 ) corresponding to a fraction of the dipole - dipole interaction energy ( @xmath44 ) . for a dipole moment ( @xmath61 ) of few debyes , and a typical experimental electric field ( </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6210@xmath63 v / m , required for the dipole moment to actually manifest itself @xcite ) , dipole - dipole separation ( @xmath64 ) on the order of 10 nm is required for @xmath39 @xmath57 1 . </S>",
    "<S> such @xmath64 is much shorter than what can be achieved in typical optical lattices ( as envisaged in @xcite , which corresponds to the regime of @xmath39 @xmath65 1 ) , but can be realized with arrays of nanoscale plasmon - enhanced electric / electro - optical traps recently proposed@xcite ( where extremely tight , few - nanometer confinement and trap frequencies exceeding 100mhz are shown to be possible ) . at such short @xmath64 , </S>",
    "<S> the dipole - dipole interaction @xmath66 is on the order of 0.1 k. cooling to a small fraction of such a temperature scale is easily within the current experimental technology . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath39 can be tuned experimentally by the electrical field , and/or by @xmath64 ( eg . by varying the microtrap configuration ) .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we presented a new way to construct an entanglement switch in an optical lattice and discussed the experimental feasibility of building such switch . </S>",
    "<S> the realization of such a scheme will have a profound impact on the implementation of quantum gates in quantum computing with trapped polar molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the similar idea could in principle also be applied to other systems with electric dipoles , such as quantum dots , excitons in nanostructurs . </S>"
