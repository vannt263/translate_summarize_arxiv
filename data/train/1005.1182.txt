    "since the discovery of the casimir effect in quantum electrodynamics @xcite it is well - known that the inherent fluctuations of a medium lead to an effective force acting on its confining boundaries . in soft matter physics , the analogue of the vacuum fluctuations in quantum electrodynamics are the thermal fluctuations of the order parameter @xmath1 of a fluid .",
    "these occur on the length scale of the bulk correlation length @xmath2 which is generically of molecular size .",
    "however , upon approaching a critical point at the temperature @xmath3 , the correlation length @xmath2 increases with an algebraic singularity and attains _ macroscopic _ values .",
    "the confinement of these long - ranged fluctuations results in the so - called critical casimir force acting on a length scale set by @xmath2 @xcite . since the correlation length diverges as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a standard bulk critical exponent , the range of the critical casimir force ( and therefore its strength at a certain distance ) can be controlled and tuned by minute temperature changes ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "the characteristic energy scale of the critical casimir effect is given by @xmath6 , which allows for a direct measurement of the critical casimir forces , in particular if the critical point is located at ambient thermodynamic conditions @xcite .",
    "the attractive or repulsive character of the critical casimir force can be controlled by suitable treatments of the confining surfaces .",
    "generically , the surfaces which confine a binary liquid mixture preferentially adsorb one of its two components ( or the gas or liquid phase in the case of a one - component fluid ) .",
    "this can be described by effective , symmetry breaking surface fields , which lead to a preference for either positive @xmath7 $ ] or negative @xmath8 $ ] values of the scalar order parameter @xmath1 , corresponding to the difference between the local concentrations of the two species ( or the deviation of the density of the one - component fluid from its critical value ) .",
    "the critical casimir force strongly depends on the effective boundary conditions ( bc ) at the walls ( see , e.g. , refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "it is attractive for equal symmetry breaking @xmath9 bc and repulsive for opposing @xmath10 bc .",
    "inter alia , this latter feature qualifies critical casimir forces to be a tool to overcome the problem of `` stiction '' which occurs in micro- and nano - mechanical devices .",
    "( the quantum electrodynamic casimir force is typically attractive and thus responsible for stiction ; turning it to be repulsive requires a careful choice of the fluid and of the bulk materials of the confinement @xcite . )",
    "the theoretical description of the critical casimir forces is particularly challenging due to the non - gaussian character of the order parameter fluctuations , which contrasts with the intrinsically gaussian nature of the low energy fluctuations of the electromagnetic field ; in addition , the critical casimir effect is also particularly rich as it allows , inter alia , symmetry breaking boundary conditions , which do not occur for electromagnetic fields .",
    "the critical casimir effect exhibits universality , i.e. , the critical casimir force expressed in terms of suitable scaling variables depends only on the universality class of the bulk critical point and on the type of boundary conditions , whereas it is independent of the microscopic structure and of the material properties of the specific fluid medium involved . in our present theoretical analysis",
    "we focus on the ising universality class which encompasses the experimentally relevant classical binary liquid mixtures and simple fluids .",
    "the existence of the critical casimir effect has been experimentally confirmed and its strength has been first measured indirectly for wetting films @xcite .",
    "the first direct measurement of this effect has been performed at the sub - micrometer scale for a spherical _ colloid _ immersed in a ( near ) critical binary liquid mixture close to a laterally homogeneous and planar substrate @xcite .",
    "the corresponding monte carlo simulation data for the _ film _ geometry are in very good quantitative agreement with all available experimental data @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of the critical casimir effect acting on colloidal particles involve spherically @xcite or ellipsoidally @xcite shaped colloids adjacent to _ homogeneous _ substrates .",
    "boundary condition ( bc ) and radius @xmath11 is located at a surface - to - surface distance @xmath12 from the substrate and its center has a lateral coordinate @xmath13 with the substrate pattern being translationally invariant in all other directions .",
    "the following four different types of substrate surfaces are considered : homogeneous substrate [ sec .  [ sec : homog ] ] , a chemical step [ @xmath14 ; sec .",
    "[ sec : step ] ] , a single chemical lane [ @xmath15 ; sec .",
    "[ sec : stripe ] ] , and a periodically patterned substrate [ @xmath16 ; sec .",
    "[ sec : period ] ] .",

    "besides their wide use as model systems in soft matter physics , colloids have applications at the micro- and nanometer scale . in this context",
    ", they are widely used in micro- and nano - mechanical devices .",
    "therefore , one may utilize the critical casimir forces acting on colloids because their strength and their direction can be tuned in a controlled way .",
    "suitably designed chemically or geometrically structured substrates generate _ lateral _ critical casimir forces acting on colloidal particles @xcite .",
    "current techniques allow one to endow solid surfaces with precise structures on the nano- and micrometer - scale .",
    "hence , the critical casimir effect can be used to create laterally confining potentials for a single colloid , which can be tuned by temperature @xcite .",
    "recently , the critical casimir potential of a colloid close to a substrate with a pattern of parallel chemical stripes with laterally alternating adsorption preference has been measured @xcite . in our corresponding theoretical study @xcite ,",
    "we have calculated the normal and lateral critical casimir forces acting on a colloid close to such a patterned substrate as well as the corresponding potentials .",
    "we have used our theoretical predictions for the universal scaling functions of the critical casimir potential in order to interpret the available experimental data in ref .  .",
    "it has turned out that an agreement between theory and experiment can be achieved only if one takes into account the geometrical details of the chemical substrate pattern .",
    "this demonstrates that the critical casimir effect is very sensitive to the details of the imprinted structures and that it can resolve them .",
    "here we generalize our previous analysis @xcite to various substrate patterns .",
    "in particular we study the critical casimir effect for a _",

    "( ii ) we use the so - called derjaguin approximation ( da ) based on the scaling functions for the critical casimir force in the film geometry either obtained analytically within mft @xcite or obtained from monte carlo simulations @xcite , which allows us to predict the critical casimir force in the physically relevant three - dimensional case .",
    "inter alia , we determine the range of validity of the da within mft , which provides guidance concerning its applicability in three spatial dimensions @xmath22 .",
    "this is an important information because presently available monte carlo simulations are far from being able to capture complex geometries @xcite .",
    "currently , the possibility of realizing stable levitation of particles by means of the electrodynamic casimir forces has been the subject of intense theoretical investigation @xcite .",
    "our results presented in secs .  [ sec : period ] and [ sec : cylinder ] show that for suitable choices of the geometry of the chemical pattern of the substrate , the critical casimir forces can be used to levitate a colloid above the substrate at a height which can be tuned by temperature .",
    "this levitation is stable against perturbations because it corresponds to a minimum of the potential of the critical casimir force acting on the colloid .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] we briefly introduce the necessary terminology related to finite - size scaling and we discuss briefly the corresponding mft . section  [ sec : homog ] is devoted to the well - studied case of a colloid close to a homogeneous substrate .",
