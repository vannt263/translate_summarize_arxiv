    "high - redshift quasars provide direct probes of the distant early universe where galaxies and quasars formed . over the past decade , many high - redshift quasars have been found in large - area surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey @xcite and two degree field ( 2df ) qso redshift survey @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , no convincing evidences for evolution in quasar spectra have been found , which is in remarked contrast to spectra of galaxies .",
    "for example , the flux ratio / in quasars is expected to be small at high - redshift because the fe - enrichment is delayed relative to the @xmath5-element enrichment ( i.e. * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "such hot dust is common in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and quasars at low redshift and also observed in high - redshift quasars @xcite .",
    "dust at high redshift is presumably produced as a result of supernova explosions , while dust production would be dominated by mass - loss of late - type stars at low - redshift .",
    "if so , hot dust at high - redshift would be different from that at low - redshift .",
    "unfortunately , hot dust in the high - redshift has been mostly studied based on broad - band photometry @xcite , and no systematic evolution has been reported .",
    "spectroscopic studies would provide new insight into evolution and origin of hot dust in the circumnuclear region of quasars .",

    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of quasars can be modelled with two components , big blue and infrared bumps @xcite .",
    "a big blue bump has been considered to be direct light from the central engine , while the infrared bump is attributed to thermal emission by dust which absorbs uv / optical light and re - emit it in the infrared .",
    "the sharp rise from @xmath42  toward the peak of the infrared bump is especially attributed to hot dust surrounding the central source .",
    "we assumed that the observed spectra only consist of a power - law emission and a single - temperature blackbody , representing the big blue bump and the infrared bump , respectively .",
    "these models are defined as : @xmath43 where @xmath5 is a power - law index , @xmath44 is the planck function with dust temperature @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the dust optical depth . for the frequency dependence of the dust optical depth",

    "the dust optical depths were just determined to be the lower limit , @xmath53 , which means that the hot dust emission of apm 08279 + 5255 is optically thick at a rest wavelength @xmath54 .",
    "our observations directly detected the optically thick region of hot dust in the quasar .",
    "these fits were made to the continua after removing significant emission features from the observed spectra . if the broad deep dip at 2.5   of the np spectrum is real continuum , as an extreme case to check the dependency of the dust temperature on the power - law index , @xmath55 and @xmath53 are obtained .",
    "thus , the dust temperature is 1280 @xmath56 .",
    "temperatures @xmath57 of this quasar suggest that graphite and silicate grains can survive as the hot dust component in this quasar because sublimation temperatures for graphite and silicate grains are @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we interpret the existence of such hot dust whose temperature is close to sublimation temperatures of dust as the innermost dust component heated by the strong radiation of the agn central engine .",
    "the dust closer to the central engine has higher temperatures but can not survive inside any critical radius at which it begins to sublimate .",
    "as we fit the hot dust emission using a single - temperature blackbody of @xmath17 1300 k in figure [ fig : fig1 ] , the luminosity of the hot dust is calculated at @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the magnification factor of the gravitational lensing .",
    "if it is assumed the blackbody emission is due to heated dust grains , a measurement of the size of emitting region can be determined from the relationship , @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the observed flux density , @xmath61 is the magnification factor , @xmath46 is the optical depth , @xmath64 is the angular diameter distance and @xmath65 is the radius of the emitting region . on the condition of @xmath66k and optical thickness , @xmath53 , as derived above , the radius of emitting region is @xmath67 .",

    "we emphasize that the hot dust mass is much less than @xmath73 from warm dust with @xmath74 and @xmath75 from cold one with @xmath76 in @xcite , in which the continuum fluxes measured in the centimeter and millimeter are fit with the 2-component dust model and their masses are calculated .    as studies of hot dust in low - redshift quasars",

    "there is also a recent work that @xcite constructed the composite spectrum from 0.58 to 3.5  from near - infrared observations of 27 quasars with the redshift of @xmath78 .",

    "the apm 08279 + 5255 data used in this figure were taken in 2006 october when the three lines were observed simultaneously .",
    "photoionization codes cloudy(version 06.02 by @xcite)was used to probe blr clouds .",
    "our models for blr clouds and the incident continuum from the central sources are the same as as those used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the incident continuum is defined as : @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the high - energy and low - energy cut - off temperature , respectively .",
    "the low - energy cutoff temperature has little effect on the spectral result , thus a temperature @xmath88 is preset for the uv bump cutoff in the infrared .",
    "the uv and x - ray continuum components are combined using a uv to x - ray logarithmic spectra slope @xmath89 .",
    "we adopted a parameter set of @xmath90 $ ] .",
    "the gas was modeled to have a constant hydrogen density @xmath91 and exposed to the ionizing continuum radiation expressed with an ionization parameter u. we performed the calculation with the @xmath92 sets in a range of @xmath93 and @xmath94 stepped by 0.5 dex .",
    "as can see in figure [ fig : fig4 ] , none of quasars agree with case b recombination , regardless of intrinsic reddening to blr clouds .",
    "the apm 08279 + 5255 data are reasonably represented with a parameter set of @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath9 . though optically thick region of hot dust surrounds the blr , the intrinsic extinction in the blr is moderate .",
    "this supports an idea of non - spherical distribution of hot dust near the central source , which is consistent with the agn model with the dust torus @xcite .      as discussed in section [ sec : res ] , the line fluxes of pa@xmath5 and pa@xmath6 have decreased by a factor of 1.5 - 2 in three years . in addition , the h@xmath5 flux also varied in six months . on the other hand , our continuum level of dust emission in @xmath95",
    "was kept constant over these periods .",
    "this means that the brightness in the blr varied while that in thermal emission from hot dust was constant .",
    "the variability of the broad lines and the constancy of the dust continuum can be explained in terms of the source size of the blr and the hot - dust emitting regions .",
    "for example , the size of the blr of ngc 4151 is a few to 10 light days ( i.e. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the inner boundary of the dusty torus extends to 48 light days from the central source @xcite . in the central source ,",
    "the gas in the accretion disk , which is falling to the supermassive black hole , radiates the continuum from the high - energy to the optical .",
    "part of this continuum is absorbed in blr clouds and thus ionized gas produces line emission such as hi recombination lines .",
    "the incident continuum is also absorbed by dust which mainly exist at a distance greater than blr clouds from the center .",
    "when the brightness of the incident continuum varies , blr lines vary in a time - delay of days or months and the thermal emission in the near- and mid - infrared radiation also varies after the time - delay of months or years .",
    "thus , the variation in the near- and mid - infrared radiation is smeared out more than that in recombination lines in blr gas , making more difficult to detect variations in emission from hot dust than recombination lines .",
    "it is unlikely that the variation in the hi recombination lines is attributed to microlensing events which have been observed lensed quasars @xcite",
    ". the lensing galaxy of apm 08279 + 5255 has not been found .",
    "if the lensing galaxy is at @xmath96 , the einstein radius of a star with @xmath97 in the lensing galaxy is @xmath98 , or @xmath99 at @xmath0 .",
    "this is much smaller than the size of hot dust which emits in the infrared , @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , the microlensing event of a star in the lensing galaxy is unable to magnify infrared emission , while it is able to magnify fluxes coming from smaller regions like blr clouds or an accretion disk .",
    "however , assuming the star in the lensing galaxy having a velocity of @xmath101 , the timescale of @xmath102 is longer than that of our detection of the variability @xcite .",
    "therefore , it might be difficult to explain that the variability is caused by microlensing .",
    "this paper presents near- and mid - infrared spectra of a gravitationally lensed quasar apm 08279 + 5255 at @xmath0 with akari / irc .",
    "the observations were performed with the irc onboard the @xmath1 infrared satellite .",
    "we have detected the continuum from 2  to 13  in the observed frame , corresponding to 0.5  to 2.4   in the rest - frame , and hydrogen emission lines of h@xmath5 , pa@xmath6 and pa@xmath5 and probably hei emission line .",
    "the major conclusions are as follows .    1 .",
    "the thermal emission of hot dust heated by the central engine of this quasar is measured by the spectral fitting with the simple model expressed with a power - law and a blackbody .",
    "the thermal emission represents optically thick emission by hot dust at @xmath103 with @xmath3 and mass , @xmath104 .",
    "the temperature is consistent with those of low - redshift quasars which were also measured spectroscopically@xcite .",
    "the flux ratios of hydrogen emission lines , h@xmath5 , pa@xmath6 and pa@xmath5 , can not be explained with the simple case b recombination model , but they are consistent with those of low - redshift sample @xcite . compared with the photoionization model , the physical condition of blr in this quasar have a parameter set of @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath105 .",
    "the moderate extinction in the blr and optically thick emission of hot dust support an idea of non - spherical distribution of dust near the central source , consistent with the agn model with the dust torus .",
    "the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath31 measurements in pa@xmath6 and pa@xmath5 emission lines could be explained by the variability of this quasar .",
    "the variability of the h@xmath5 emission line was also detected with multiple observations with @xmath1 in a span of six months .",
    "there are two possibilities of variability for this quasars : the intrinsic variability of this quasar itself and the microlensing caused by a star in a lensing galaxy . considering the timescale of microlensing , it might be ruled out for an explanation of the variability .",
    "our @xmath1 spectroscopic observations revealed that apm 08279 + 5255 at @xmath0 show a lack of evolution in the blr and the hot dust component .",
    "this suggests that these components in this quasar have reached maturity very early on .",
    "this conclusion is probably applicable to most of quasars because the studies of broad emission lines in high - redshift quasars show the lack of the evolution ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the infrared photometric studies @xcite of quasars in @xmath106 do not differ significantly from those in low - redshift .",

    "<S> we present rest - frame optical / near - infrared spectra of the gravitationally lensed quasar apm 08279 + 5255 at @xmath0 that has been taken using the infrared camera ( irc ) onboard the @xmath1 infrared satellite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed continuum consists of two components ; a power - law component dominating optical wavelengths which is the direct light from the central source and thermal emission dominating near - infrared wavelengths which is attributed to the emission from hot dust in the circumnuclear region . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal emission well represents optically thick emission by hot dust at @xmath2k with @xmath3 and apparent mass , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our observations directly detected the optically thick region of hot dust in apm 08279 + 5255 . </S>",
    "<S> hi recombination lines of h@xmath5(0.656 ) , pa@xmath5(1.875 ) , and pa@xmath6(1.282 ) are clearly detected at 3.2 , 6.3 , and 9.3 . </S>",
    "<S> simulations with the photoionization models suggest that apm 08279 + 5255 has blr(broad line region ) clouds characterized by @xmath7 for the gas density , @xmath8 for the ionization parameter , and @xmath9 for the broad line region . </S>",
    "<S> thus , optically thick emission of hot dust support an idea on non - spherical distribution of dust near the central source , consistent with the active galactic nuclei model with the dust torus . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of hot dust and flux ratios of these hi lines are similar to those observed in low - redshift quasars . </S>",
    "<S> there are significant time - variations in the hi lines , which are probably caused by variations in the brightness of the central source . </S>"
