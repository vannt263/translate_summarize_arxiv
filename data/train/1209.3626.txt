    "a cooper - pair pump @xcite is a superconducting device that can be used to transport cooper pairs by manipulating some of its parameters in a periodic fashion .",
    "cooper - pair pumps have recently attracted considerable theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite attention .",
    "part of this attention stems from the geometric properties of the parametric cycle used to perform pumping .",
    "these properties , in turn , leave a distinctive fingerprint in the pumped charge . the link between geometric phases and pumped charge has been established in the adiabatic limit , where an explicit relation connects the pumped charge to the berry phase @xcite , as first shown in ref .   and experimentally demonstrated in ref .  .",
    "in addition , the breakdown of adiabatic behavior due to landau - zener transitions can be detected as a decrease in the pumped charge @xcite .",
    "this offers the opportunity to develop landau - zener - stckelberg interferometry @xcite based on geometric phases @xcite .",
    "finally , it has been proposed to exploit cooper - pair pumps for the observation of nonabelian geometric phases @xcite .",
    "another reason to study cooper - pair pumps is that they are convenient solid - state implementations of a driven quantum two - level system . in the presence of a dissipative environment ,",
    "the pumped charge is determined by the quasistationary state reached by the system and thus is a sensitive probe of decoherence effects .",
    "this explains why a cooper - pair pump was chosen as a `` case in point '' in several theoretical works aimed at studying the role of dissipation in driven quantum systems @xcite .",
    "different types of cooper - pair pumps have been proposed and realized @xcite .",
    "all these devices comprise the same building blocks , namely , superconducting islands connected to each other and to superconducting leads by josephson junctions .",
    "they are intended to be operated in a regime where the charging energy of the islands is much larger than the josephson energies of the couplings .",
    "thus , at the heart of these implementations is the `` classical '' phenomenon of coulomb blockade . pumping relies on periodic modulation of electrostatic potentials , tuned by gate electrodes which act as pistons in pulling cooper pairs onto and off the islands .",
    "the main contribution to pumping comes from incoherent tunneling of cooper pairs @xcite , with phase - coherent effects only providing small corrections .    in this",
    ", we undertake a different approach to cooper - pair pumping , that we call `` flux pumping '' ( fp ) .",
    "fp is based on the coherent transfer of a superposition of charge states across a superconducting island by adiabatic manipulation of magnetic fluxes .",
    "contrary to previous proposals , fp does not involve the modulation of electrostatic potentials .",
    "the pumped charge resulting from fp is purely coherent .",
    "its dependence on the phase bias across the pump reveals intriguing features . among them",
    ", we find that for a particular choice of the system parameters , an arbitrarily large charge can be pumped per cycle .",
    "however , this is by no means inconsistent as at the same time the adiabatic criterion requires the pumping cycle to be correspondingly slow .",
    "the device we consider for fp uses the same hardware as the cooper pair sluice introduced in ref .  .",
    "yet pumping is achieved in a completely different manner .",
    "first , the gate voltage is kept constant throughout the pumping cycle .",
    "second , the opening times of the superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) used as valves have a large overlap .",
    "fp also differs from cooper - pair shuttling @xcite , in at least two respects .",
    "first , while the `` shuttle '' is only coupled to one lead at a time ( hence its name ) , in our case simultaneous coupling of the central island to both leads is required to achieve a nonvanishing pumped charge .",
    "second , the operation of the shuttle is non - adiabatic and requires accurate control of the time dependence of the pulses .",
    "by contrast , fp is insensitive to the speed at which the cycle is performed , as long as the modulation is adiabatic .",
    "this is a consequence of the geometric nature of the pumped charge .",
    "features such as the large overlap between the flux pulses , the subordinate role played by coulomb blockade , and the overall coherence of the pumping process , bring fp close together with pumping in open systems , @xcite sometimes referred to as `` quantum pumping '' .",
    "fp thus opens a new possibility to explore quantum pumping in superconducting systems .",
    "fp can also be connected to some adiabatic transfer schemes used in quantum information , in particular , the coherent transfer by adiabatic passage ( ctap ) protocol @xcite . in both schemes , the transfer relies on time - dependent manipulation of tunnelling rates rather than energy levels . however , only in fp is the device connected to leads , thereby allowing for the generation of a continuous pumped current .",
    "the presence of superconducting leads and their phase bias introduce novel features that have no equivalent in ctap .",
    "a hallmark of ctap is the so - called counter - intuitive pulse ordering : in order to transfer information from left to right , the right tunnel junction is operated first . in fp",
    "we do find a similar behavior when the phase bias is close to @xmath0 ; in general , however , current flows in the same direction as the pulse sequence .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "[ fig : sluice ]  ( a ) .",
    "it is a fully tunable cooper - pair transistor , consisting of a small superconducting island connected to leads by two squids .",
    "the squids are controlled independently by adjusting the magnetic fluxes @xmath5 threading their loops , so that they can serve as josephson junctions of tunable energy @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "a gate electrode capacitively coupled to the island controls its polarization charge in units of cooper pairs @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the cross - capacitance between gate and island and @xmath10 the gate voltage .",
    "we assume that the superconducting electrodes to which the sluice is connected are held at a fixed phase difference @xmath3 .",
    "the simplest way to accomplish this is to embed the sluice in a superconducting loop .",
    "an other possibility is to shunt the sluice with a large josephson junction of energy @xmath11 . in this configuration ,",
    "the josephson junction can also serve as a current threshold detector .",
    "this technique was first applied to the readout of the `` quantronium '' circuit @xcite and then proposed for @xcite and successfully applied to @xcite the sluice .",
    "we use the sluice in the regime where the charging energy @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the total island capacitance ) is large compared to @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we describe the dynamics in the basis of eigenstates of charge on the island , and restrict the hilbert space to the states @xmath14 and @xmath15 with no and one excess cooper pair on the island , respectively . in this two - level approximation ,",
    "the hamiltonian is given in matrix form by @xcite h & = & (    cc e_c(12+n_g)^2 & j_+ 2 + i j_-2 + j_+ 2 -i j_-2 & e_c(12-n_g)^2    )  [ eq : ham ] where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 the offset between the gate charge and the degeneracy point .",
    "we now outline how to obtain the pumped charge in the adiabatic limit .",
    "we use the same notation as in ref .  , to which the reader is referred for a more detailed account .",
    "we also set @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    a pumping cycle is described by a closed loop in the space of a minimal set of parameters determining @xmath20 .",
    "under the assumption that the parameters are changed slow enough , the system will approximately follow the instantaneous ground state of @xmath20 .",
    "this fact underlies the adiabatic theorem and is at the basis of a perturbation expansion .",
    "the latter is formally accomplished by introducing a local adiabatic parameter @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are , respectively , the instantaneous ground and excited state of @xmath20 ( adiabatic states ) and @xmath24 is the instantaneous energy gap at time @xmath25 .",
    "the adiabatic limit is attained provided @xmath26 at all times .",
    "we will find use for the following quantities :    [ eq : quantities ] @xmath27    in terms of the fixed @xmath28 basis , the adiabatic states are explicitly given by :    [ eq : g_e ] @xmath29    in order to properly account for the pumped charge , it is essential to consider the corrections to the instantaneous ground state up to first order in @xmath30 .",
    "the resulting density matrix of the sluice , expressed in the adiabatic basis , is given by    [ eq : rhogg_rhoge ] @xmath31    after solving the dynamics , we can turn to the calculation of the pumped charge .",
    "we introduce current operators @xmath32 for the @xmath33-th squid ( @xmath34 ) . in the @xmath28 basis , one has : i_l & = & (    cc 0 & -e^-i/2 + e^i/2 & 0    )  [ eq : il ] + i_r & = & (    cc 0 & e^i/2 + -e^-i/2 & 0    )  [ eq : ir ]    the expectation value of the current is given by @xmath35 where we have singled out a dynamic contribution @xmath36 and a geometric contribution @xmath37 . while @xmath38 relates to the usual supercurrent flowing in the presence of a phase bias , @xmath39 encapsulates the effects of the parametric drive ( note that @xmath40 for time - independent parameters ) and is thus identified with the pumped current .",
    "the total charge transferred through the @xmath33-th squid in a period is given by @xmath41 .",
    "once again it is possible to distinguish a dynamic charge @xmath42 and a geometric ( pumped ) charge @xmath43 , so that @xmath44 . adiabatic evolution and charge conservation force all three types of charges to be equal for the left and right squid .",
    "for this reason , we will safely drop the subscript @xmath33 in the following . as first shown in ref .",
    ", @xmath45 and @xmath46 are related to the derivative with respect to @xmath3 of the dynamic phase @xmath47 and the geometric ( berry ) phase @xmath48 accumulated by the instantaneous ground state along a pumping cycle : q_d & = &  , + q_p & = &  .",
    "[ eq : berry_qp ]    experimentally , @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be distinguished as they obey different symmetries .",
    "in particular upon reversing the direction of the pumping , @xmath45 is not affected , while @xmath46 duly changes its sign .",
    "we shall henceforth assume that such a distinction can be made and only be concerned with @xmath46 .",
    "the principle of fp is illustrated in fig .  [ fig : sluice ]  ( b ) , showing the time evolution of the control parameters during a pumping cycle .",
    "the charge offset @xmath49 , not shown , is set close to the degeneracy point ( that is , @xmath50 ) and kept fixed throughout the cycle . at the initial time @xmath51 , the island is decoupled from both leads , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 set to their minimum value @xmath52 . in sector i ( @xmath53 ) , the coupling to the left lead is turned on by maximizing @xmath6 . in sector ii ( @xmath54 ) , the coupling is swapped from the left to the right lead , in such a way that the sum @xmath55 is kept constant .",

    ", the fact that the dynamics is coherent plays a crucial role .",
    "this marks a clear difference between fp and previous pumping protocols . in the latter cooper - pair tunneling",

    "in sec .  [ sec : pumping ] , we carried out our calculations assuming adiabatic evolution during the pumping cycle . in this limit",
    ", the pumped charge is uniquely determined by the loop described in the parameter space of @xmath20 . as such",
    ", it does not depend on the pumping frequency .",
    "we also pointed out , however , that the validity of the adiabatic theorem requires the condition @xmath97 to hold .",
    "we then warned the reader that in the limit @xmath71 , due to the vanishing of the instantaneous energy gap at @xmath51 ( and at @xmath92 when @xmath76 ) , this condition requires the pumping cycle to be infinitely slow .",

    "furthermore , the final state of the pump at the end of the pumping cycle is in general different from its initial state .",
    "as measurements are typically averaged over very many cycles , the quantity of experimental interest becomes the stationary pumped charge @xmath98 .",
    "the latter is determined by an interplay between the nonadiabatic drive and decoherence effects due to the electromagnetic environment in which the pump is embedded . a full characterization of such effects is beyond the scope of this work .",

    "we present numerical results obtained using the master equation approach developed in refs .  , which consistently accounts for the combined action of a quasi - adiabatic drive and decoherence on an open quantum two - level system .",
    "this formalism is not intended to address the fully nonadiabatic case ; yet , it can be conveniently used to investigate the parameter region where the adiabatic condition ceases to hold .",
    "decoherence ( dephasing and relaxation ) is modeled by attaching a fictitious environment to the pump , in the form of a resistor capacitively coupled to the central island .",
