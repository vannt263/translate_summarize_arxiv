    "superconductivity and long - range magnetic order are two outstanding quantum phenomena ; however these ground states are not generally displayed by the same electrons simultaneously .",
    "this is because an internal magnetic field arising from magnetic order usually destroys superconductivity . in the 1970s ,",
    "a number of materials were found to host both superconductivity and magnetic order , but the two orders were due to different electrons and occurred in spatially - separated regions .",
    "this is also true in the recently reported ruthenate - cuprate hybrid compound rusr@xmath13rcu@xmath13o@xmath14 ( r = rare earth ) where the ruo and cuo@xmath13 planes are responsible for the magnetic order and superconductivity , respectively @xcite .",
    "an exceptional case is the heavy fermion compound upd@xmath13al@xmath15 in which magnetic order and superconductivity coexist homogeneously @xcite . in this system , however , it is believed that the multiple bands of uranium ( u ) electrons make such coexistence possible .",
    "namely , among three u-5f electrons , the two with localized character are responsible for the magnetism and the remaining one is responsible for superconductivity @xcite .",
    "such `` duality '' may also be at work in other u - based heavy fermion magneto - superconductors @xcite .",
    "it is therefore an outstanding question whether magnetic order and superconductivity due to the same electrons can coexist on a microscopic length scale . although it has been proposed theoretically that magnetism and superconductivity may be viewed as two sub - components of a unified group and that they may coexist under certain conditions @xcite , accumulation of convincing experimental evidence is important .",
    "the ce - based heavy fermion compounds and high superconducting transition - temperature ( @xmath7 ) copper oxides are hosts of single - band magnetism or / and superconductivity , and are therefore good candidate materials for exploring this problem .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that in the layered heavy fermion compounds ce(rh@xmath1ir@xmath16)in@xmath3 @xcite and ce(rh@xmath1co@xmath16)in@xmath3 @xcite and also cerhin@xmath3 under pressure @xcite , antiferromagnetism and superconductivity coexist .",

    "note that this quantity increases smoothly with increasing ir concentration .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "4 can be interpreted as follows .",
    "in(2 ) has two nearest neighbor @xmath42 ( rh , ir ) sites .",
    "there are @xmath4 ir atoms and @xmath43 rh atoms for a given alloy concentration x. if the nqr frequency is sensitive to the local environment , there will be three resonance lines depending on the nearest neighbor configuration of a given in(2 ) , namely , ( rh , rh ) , ( rh , ir ) or ( ir , ir ) .",
    "the intensity of each peak will be proportional to the probability that in(2 ) has a corresponding nearest neighbor pair , namely , ( rh , rh ) , ( rh , ir ) or ( ir , ir ) . figure 4 strongly suggests that this is the case , with the central transition corresponding to the case with ( rh , ir ) nearest neighbors .",
    "in such a scenario , one might then wonder why in(1 ) only sees an averaged environment .",
    "this is probably because the wave function mixing between in(1 ) and the @xmath42 atom is weaker than in the case of in(2 ) , because in(1 ) is farther away from @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , in(1 ) has eight nearest neighbor @xmath42 atoms .",
    "the effect of having different nearest - neighbor pair is thus further averaged out . as a result ,",
    "each in(1 ) transition is observed as a broadened line .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of in(2 ) whose @xmath44-orbital directly mixes with those of @xmath42 .",
    "since @xmath30 is dominated by the on - site electronic configuration @xcite , the stronger coupling between in(2 ) and @xmath42 atoms gives rise to three distinct resonance lines in the alloyed samples rather than a broad single transition as in the case of in(1 ) .",
    "although the in(2 ) transition is sensitive to the local atomic configuration , it should be emphasized that globally the electronic states are quite homogeneous , as evidenced by the results of spin - lattice relaxation measurements described in the next subsection .",
    "the @xmath8 measurements were performed at the peak of the 2@xmath30 transition ( @xmath37 for the in(1 ) site and at the central peak of the three lowest frequency transition ( @xmath37 ) lines for the in(2 ) site .",
    "figure 5 shows the decay curve of the nuclear magnetization for @xmath4=0.45 at three typical temperatures above and below @xmath6 and @xmath7 . at t=0.2k",
    "we used a small tipping - angle pulse so that the magnetization is less saturated at small delay time .",
    "the decay curve can be fitted by a single component of @xmath27 to the theoretical curve @xcite , @xmath45 the same quality of data were obtained for all alloys and also for the in(2 ) site , whose nuclear magnetization is fitted to the theoretical curve @xcitewith a single component of @xmath27 .",

    "it can be seen that all sites show a quite similar @xmath10 dependence .",

    "the absolute value is also very similar . in the figure ,",

    "this result also resembles the behavior of cerhin@xmath3 @xcite as a function of pressure and indicates that the substitution of ir for rh acts as chemical pressure in cerhin@xmath3 .    due to the broadening of the spectra upon alloying , it is difficult to estimate precisely the internal magnetic field in the ordered state .",

    "<S> the results provide strong evidence for the microscopic coexistence of antiferromagnetic ( af ) order and superconductivity ( sc ) in the range of 0.35 @xmath5 0.55 . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , for @xmath4=0.5 , @xmath6 is observed at 3 k with a subsequent onset of superconductivity at @xmath7=0.9 k. @xmath7 reaches a maximum ( 0.94 k ) at @xmath4=0.45 where @xmath6 is found to be the highest ( 4.0 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> detailed analysis of the measured spectra indicate that the same electrons participate in both sc and af order . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath8 shows a broad peak at @xmath6 and follows a @xmath9 variation below @xmath7 , the latter property indicating unconventional sc as in ceirin@xmath3 ( @xmath7=0.4 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> we further find that , in the coexistence region , the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath8 is replaced by a @xmath10-linear variation below @xmath110.4 k , with the value @xmath12 increasing with decreasing @xmath4 , likely due to low - lying magnetic excitations associated with the coexisting magnetism . </S>"
