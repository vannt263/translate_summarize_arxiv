    "so far the most important question to be answered in particle physics is the mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking and thus hunting for the higgs boson responsible for it is the main task of current collider experiments . in the framework of the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the mass of the higgs boson is preferred to be @xmath1 gev by precision electroweak data @xcite . to search for such a relatively light higgs boson ,",
    "great efforts have been made in lep and tevatron experiments , which reported null results and excluded a higgs boson with @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath3 @xcite at 95@xmath4 c.l .. the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is more powerful in discovering the sm higgs boson , and depending on its mass , different search strategies will be applied . for a light higgs boson below 140 gev , although its largest signal at the lhc is @xmath5 from the gluon - fusion process @xmath6 @xcite , such a signal is undetectable due to the overwhelming qcd background ; instead , the rare decay mode @xmath7 with @xmath8 for @xmath9120 gev offers a very clean signature to make the di - photon signal @xmath0 a promising discovery channel .",
    "it is now expected that , with @xmath10 integrated luminosity at the lhc running at @xmath11 tev , the di - photon signal is able to exclude the light higgs boson in the sm @xcite .    in low energy supersymmetric models ( susy ) , the sm - like higgs boson ( the cp - even higgs boson with largest coupling to gauge bosons )",
    "is usually predicted with mass below about 140 gev .",
    "for such a higgs boson , although there may exist other discovery channels at the lhc , the di - photon channel @xmath0 is still one of the most important discovery modes .",
    "so , studying this signal will allow for a probe of low energy susy and , as emphasized in @xcite , even a discrimination of different models .",
    "although in the literature some studies of the signal have been presented in susy @xcite , these analyses were performed separately in different models and a comparative study is necessary in order to discriminate the models . in this work",
    "we perform such a comparative study by considering three different susy models , namely the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite and the nearly minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite .",
    "we will scan over the parameter space under current constraints from collider experiments and the neutralino dark matter relic density , and then in the allowed parameter space we calculate the di - photon signal rate and compare the results for different models .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "we first briefly describe the three supersymmetric models in sec .",
    "then we present our numerical results and discussions in sec .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in sec",
    "as the most economical realization of susy in particle physics , the mssm has been intensively studied . however , since this model suffers from the @xmath12problem and the little hierarchy problem , some of its extensions like the nmssm and nmssm were recently paid attention to@xcite .",
    "the differences of these models come from their superpotentials : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mssm superpotential without the @xmath15 term , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the higgs doublet and singlet superfields respectively , and the dimensionless coefficients @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 and the dimensional coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath21 are usually treated as independent parameters . in the nmssm and nmssm , when the scalar component ( @xmath22 ) of the singlet higgs superfield @xmath23 develops a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , an desired effective @xmath15-term ( @xmath24 ) is generated at the weak scale .",
    "note that the nmssm differs from the nmssm in the last term of the superpotential , where the cubic singlet term @xmath25 in the nmssm is replaced by the tadpole term @xmath26 .",
    "considering that the tadpole term does not induce any interaction , one can infer that , except for the minimization conditions of the higgs potential and the mass matrices of the higgs bosons , the nmssm is actually identical to the nmssm with vanishing @xmath19 .",
    "corresponding to eq.([mssm - pot]-[nmssm - pot ] ) , the soft - breaking terms in higgs sector are given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are all soft parameters .",
    "like the usual treatment of the multiple higgs theory , one can write the scalar fields @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath22 as @xmath36 and diagonalize the mass matrices of the higgs bosons to get their mass eigenstates : @xmath37 in above expressions , @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote physical cp - even and cp - odd neutral higgs bosons respectively , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are goldstone bosons eaten by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the charged higgs boson . note in the mssm , due to the absence of @xmath22 there only exist two cp - even higgs bosons and one cp - odd higgs boson , and consequently , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are reduced to @xmath47 matrices parameterized by the mixing angles @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively . in our study , we choose the input parameters in the higgs sector as ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath15 ) for the mssm , ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath50 , @xmath52 , @xmath51 , @xmath33 ) for the nmssm with @xmath53 , and ( @xmath18 , @xmath54 , @xmath52 , @xmath32 , @xmath55 , @xmath51 ) for the nmssm with @xmath56 ) .",
    "the yukawa couplings of the neutral higgs bosons to the top and bottom quarks are given by @xcite @xmath57 with @xmath45 , @xmath46 defined in eq.([rotation ] ) .",
    "obviously , once @xmath58 as discussed later , the width of @xmath59 is to be suppressed .",
    "note the properties of the lightest neutralino @xmath60 in the nmssm are quite peculiar @xcite .",
    "after diagonalizing the neutralino mass matrix in the nmssm , its mass takes the form @xcite @xmath61 which implies that @xmath60 must be lighter than about @xmath62 gev for @xmath63 ( required by chargino mass bound ) and @xmath64 ( required by perturbativity ) .",
    "if @xmath60 acts as the dark matter candidate , a light cp - odd higgs boson @xmath65 is then preferred to accelerate @xmath60 annihilation to get the acceptable dark matter relic density@xcite .",
    "detailed study indicates that @xmath66 and for most cases , @xmath67 , which implies the sm - like higgs boson @xmath68 may decay into @xmath69 or @xmath70 so that @xmath71 is suppressed@xcite .",
    "to compare the signal rate with the sm prediction , we define a normalized rate as @xmath72 /[\\gamma(h_{sm}\\to gg ) br(h_{sm}\\to \\gamma\\gamma ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = &   [ \\gamma(h\\to gg ) \\gamma(h\\to \\gamma\\gamma ) ] /[\\gamma(h_{sm}\\to gg ) \\gamma(h_{sm}\\to \\gamma\\gamma ) ] \\times \\gamma_{tot}(h_{sm})/\\gamma_{tot}(h )   \\label{definition}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used the narrow width approximation and the fact that at leading order the cross section of the parton process @xmath73 is correlated with the decay width of @xmath74 by @xmath75 in susy , the @xmath76 coupling arises mainly from the loops mediated by w - boson , charged higgs boson , charginos and the third generation fermions and sfermions , and the @xmath77 coupling only from the loops mediated by third generation quarks and squarks .",
    "consequently , the widths of @xmath78 are given by @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 , and @xmath81 represent pure susy contributions with @xmath82 and @xmath83 being sfermion mass and chargino mass respectively . noting the asymptotic behavior of @xmath84 in the limit @xmath85@xcite @xmath86 one can easily learn that the effects of the third generation squarks on the @xmath87 and @xmath77 couplings drop quickly as the squarks becomes heavy , and that the charged higgs contribution to @xmath87 coupling is usually far smaller than the @xmath88-boson contribution .",
    "in susy , the third generation squarks can also affect the masses and the couplings of the cp - even higgs bosons by radiative corrections , and such effects are maximized in the so - called `` maximal mixing '' ( @xmath89 ) scenario defined as @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the on - shell scheme @xcite , where @xmath92 with @xmath93 denoting the trilinear couplings of the top squarks and @xmath94 standing for the common soft breaking mass for the third generation squarks , i.e. , @xmath95 .",
    "since the corrections are vital for our results , we will specially discuss them later .",
    "different from previous studies in @xcite , we consider more constraints on the models , which are :    * the constraints from the lep - ii direct search for neutral higgs bosons in various possible channels . * the direct mass bounds on sparticles and higgs boson from lep and the tevatron experiments @xcite . * the lep - i constraints on invisible @xmath42 decay : @xmath96 , and the lep - ii constraints on neutralino productions @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xcite . * the indirect constraints from b - physics ( such as @xmath99 ) and from the precision electroweak observables such as @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , or their combinations @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "we require @xmath104 to be compatible with the lep / sld data at @xmath105 confidence level .",
    "we also require new physics prediction of @xmath106 is within the @xmath107 range of its experimental value .",
    "the latest results for @xmath108 are @xmath109 and @xmath110 for @xmath111 gev @xcite . * the constraints from tevatron experiments on @xmath112@xcite . * the constraints from the muon anomalous magnetic moment : @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "we require the susy effects to explain @xmath114 at @xmath115 level .",
    "* dark matter constraints from the wmap relic desity 0.0975 @xmath116 0.1213 @xcite . for each model",
    "we assume the lightest neutralino as the only component for the dark matter .",
    "as verified by numerous studies , these constraints show strong preference on the susy parameters , e.g. , the constraint ( 1 ) favors heavy top squarks with significant chiral mixing , while the constraint ( 6 ) favors large @xmath54 for moderately heavy sleptons .",
    "note that most of the constraints have been encoded in the program nmssmtools @xcite , which computes various higgs decay rates up to one - loop level ( the dominant one - loop and leading logarithmic two - loop corrections to the higgs masses and mixings are also included ) .",
    "we extend the code by adding more constraints in item ( 4 ) @xcite and further make it applicable to the nmssm @xcite ( through some helpful discussions with the authors of the nmssmtools ) .",
    "since the lhc is now testing the probability of the enhanced di - photon signal , we investigate the situation where the signal rate can exceed its sm prediction .",
    "eq.([definition ] ) indicates two mechanisms in doing this .",
    "one is to enhance the @xmath117 coupling or the @xmath77 coupling .",
    "however , as indicated by our numerical results , this mechanism can only enhance the couplings by a factor up to 1.3 and 1.1 , respectively .",
    "the reason is that the relevant susy parameters , such as @xmath54 and the third generation squark masses , have been limited by the constraints .",
    "the other mechanism , which proves to be capable in enhancing @xmath118 by a factor up to 5 , is to suppress the width of @xmath119 to enhance the branching ratio of @xmath120 . to understand this ,",
    "let s look at the expression of @xmath121 , which , after including the important susy correction to bottom quark mass @xmath122 , is given by@xcite @xmath123 where the first factor comes from the bottom yukawa coupling in eq.([yukawa ] ) and the second factor arises from transforming the higgs fields from weak basis to mass eigenstates in the low energy effective lagrangian .",
    "obviously , once @xmath124 and/or @xmath125 , @xmath126 will be greatly suppressed . in the following ,",
    "we take the mssm as an example to discuss how to satisfy the conditions .    in the mssm , eq.([width ] ) may be rewritten as@xcite @xmath127 where @xmath48 is the mixing angle of the two cp - even higgs boson obtained by diagonalizing the corresponding mass matrix @xmath128 , and @xmath122 is given by @xmath129 with the function @xmath130 defined by @xmath131 given @xmath132 where @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) denote the important radiative corrections with their leading contributions proportional to @xmath135 , one can numerically check that without @xmath133 , @xmath136 is always larger than unity for @xmath137 as required by muon anomalous momentum .",
    "so to suppress @xmath138 or equivalently the off - diagonal entry of the mass matrix the radiative correction must be present , and a positive large @xmath139 along with a light cp - odd higgs boson is efficiency in doing this .",
    "meanwhile , given @xmath140 , @xmath122 must be around unity to satisfy @xmath141 , which requires large @xmath142 . in summary , in order to suppress @xmath143 , light @xmath144 as well as large @xmath142 is favored for given sparticle spectrum .",
    "we note what we are discussing is actually the so - called ` small @xmath145 scenario ' of the mssm @xcite .    from eqs.([definition]-[cp - even mass ] )",
    "one can infer that , in the heavy sparticle limit , the effective @xmath117 and @xmath146 couplings approach to their sm predictions and @xmath118 is determined by @xmath143 or more generally by the total width @xmath147 ; while in a general case , the contribution from the sparticle - loops to the couplings may interfere constructively or destructively with its corresponding sm contribution , and the size @xmath118 then depends on the competition of @xmath148 with @xmath147 .",
    "we checked that this conclusion is also applicable to the nmssm and the nmssm .      to study @xmath118 quantatively",
    "we scan over the mssm parameters under the constraints ( 1 - 7 ) and calculate the di - photon signal rate for the samples surviving the constraints . since the first two generation squarks have little effects on the di - photon signal rate , in our scan we fix their soft parameters at @xmath149 . as for sleptons , since it only affects significantly the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath150 , which can in turn limit the important parameter @xmath54 , we assume all soft parameters in slepton sector to take a common value @xmath151 and treat @xmath151 as a free parameter . for simplicity , we also assume the grand unification relation for the gaugino masses , @xmath152 with @xmath153 being the fine structure constants of the different gauge groups .",
    "our scan regions are @xmath154 in fig.[fig1 ] we display the surviving samples , showing the di - photon signal ratio @xmath155 defined in eq.([definition ] ) and the higgs decay branching ratio versus the mass of the sm - like higgs boson .",
    "this figure shows that in the mssm there exist some points where @xmath156 is enhanced by a factor up to 1.5 .",
    "such an enhancement is mainly due to the suppression of the total width of @xmath68 , or equivalently the enhancement of br(@xmath7 ) , which is shown in the right frame of fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "note that we required @xmath157 in our scan .",
    "if we relax @xmath158 in the scan , we find that @xmath155 can be as large as 4 .",
    "we checked that those samples giving @xmath159 actually correspond to the ` small @xmath145 scenario ' discussed in @xcite , which is characterized by a large @xmath142 and @xmath160 .",
    "defined in eq.([definition ] ) and the higgs decay branching ratio versus the mass of the sm - like higgs boson.,title=\"fig : \" ]   defined in eq.([definition ] ) and the higgs decay branching ratio versus the mass of the sm - like higgs boson.,title=\"fig : \" ]    fig.[fig1 ] also shows that for most of the samples , the rate of the di - photon signal is suppressed relative to its sm prediction .",
    "these samples are usually characterized by an enhanced @xmath161 coupling and a reduced @xmath77 coupling ( the change of the @xmath162 coupling is usually negligible ) .",
    "we checked that for @xmath163 the effect of the reduced @xmath77 coupling may be dominant , while for @xmath164 the effect of the enhanced @xmath161 coupling is always dominant .",
    "we emphasize that for the samples with @xmath164 , @xmath144 must be relatively light ( @xmath165 ) to ensure that the properties of @xmath68 significantly deviate from the sm higgs boson @xcite .",
    "we note that current experiments can not rule out a light @xmath144 with @xmath166 in the mssm @xcite . in this case , both @xmath144 and @xmath167 ( the heavier cp - even higgs boson ) give rise to the di - photon signals similar to the sm - like higgs boson @xmath68 . however , the rates of these signals from @xmath144 and @xmath167 can not be large .",
    "this is because for @xmath168 , @xmath54 must be larger than @xmath169 as required by the constraints ( particularly by @xmath150 ) @xcite , which implies @xmath170 from the tree - level relation @xmath171 .",
    "since the @xmath172 and @xmath173 couplings are proportional to @xmath174 and @xmath175 respectively , the branching ratios of @xmath176 are suppressed and so are their induced di - photon signals at the lhc @xcite .",
    "since the nmssm and the nmssm have more free parameters than the mssm , it is difficult to perform a general analysis of the signal rate .",
    "however , considering our aim is to show the differences of these three models , we examine the signal in the so - called @xmath89 scenario described in sec .",
    "[ sec - a ] . in this scenario , under the constraints ( 1 - 7 ) we scan over the following parameter ranges : @xmath177 for the mssm , @xmath178 for the nmssm , and @xmath179 for the nmssm with the soft parameters to be 100 gev for the ( @xmath180 ) sector in order to satisfy the @xmath150 constraint@xcite . for other insensitive parameters we adopt the same assumption as in the last section .",

    "this figure shows that in the nmssm the signal is always suppressed . in the mssm the signal",
    "is mostly suppressed , but in a tiny part of the parameter space the signal can be slightly enhanced . in the nmssm ,",
    "however , the signal can be enhanced in a sizable part of the parameter space ( the enhancement factor can be as large as 7 ) . in order to figure out the reason for such a large enhancement in the nmssm , we concentrate on the samples with @xmath186 and study the ratio @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "our results are shown in fig.[fig3 ] , which indicates that the production rate can be enhanced maximally by a factor of 1.25 , while @xmath189 can be enhanced to @xmath190 once @xmath191 is suppressed to several percent .",
    "this conclusion justifies our previous analysis about the mechanisms to enhance the signal .",
    "quite surprisingly , we found that in the nmssm the samples with @xmath192 are unnecessarily accompanied by a large @xmath15 .",
    "the fundamental reason is that in susy the @xmath161 coupling is determined by the @xmath35 component of @xmath68 , and in the nmssm , due to the presence of singlet field component in @xmath68 , the @xmath161 coupling can be suppressed more efficiently than in the mssm .",
    "we also noticed that once @xmath191 is suppressed , @xmath193 ( @xmath194 ) may also get enhanced , which should be limited by the combined search for higgs boson at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "we checked that for @xmath195 , @xmath196 can be enhanced by a factor of 4 relative to its sm prediction .",
    "for the samples with a suppressed di - photon rate in the nmssm and the nmssm , we find that @xmath147 is usually enhanced ( due to the enhanced @xmath197 and/or the open - up of new decay modes ) and the @xmath77 coupling is reduced .",
    "we checked that for @xmath198 the former effect is dominant .",
    "we note that in the nmssm @xmath118 is usually small , which is mainly due to the open - up of new decay modes of @xmath68 , such as @xmath199 ( @xmath200 ) or @xmath201 with their rates shown in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "we emphasize that this feature comes from the peculiarity of @xmath60 in the nmssm ( see eq.([mass - exp ] ) ) and should keep valid regardless our choice of the soft parameters in the squark sector .",
    "we numerically checked this point by a more general scan than eq.([nmssm - scan ] ) .",
    "we also note that for nearly all the samples in the nmssm with @xmath202 we have @xmath203 , and for all the samples in the nmssm with @xmath204 we have @xmath205 .",
    "we owe this to the constraints we considered , which severely constrained the enhancement of the branching ratio of @xmath206 ( see fig.[fig3 ] and fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "we also studied the di - photon signal rate in the ` no - mixing ' scenario defined as @xmath91 and @xmath207 .",
    "however , we found it is difficult for this scenario to satisfy the constraints if @xmath208 , especially we did not find any surviving samples for the mssm .",
    "since the di - photon signal for the surviving samples in the nmssm and the nmssm do not exhibit new characteristics , we do not present the results here .",
    "so , we see that in low energy susy , depending on the models , the di - photon signal rate at the lhc may be significantly suppressed or enhanced relative to the sm prediction . with",
    "@xmath10 integrated luminosity at the running lhc , the di - photon signal can allow for a test of the sm and a probe of the low energy susy models .",
    "for example , if the di - photon signal rate is found to be not smaller than the sm prediction , then the nmssm will be immediately excluded ( note that in this case the universal extra dimension and the little higgs theory will also be ruled out because they suppressed the diphoton signal rate @xcite ) .",
    "we focused on the di - photon higgs signal @xmath209 for the sm - like higgs boson at the lhc and performed a comparative study for three susy models : the mssm , nmssm and nmssm .",
    "considering various collider and cosmological constraints , we scanned over the parameter space and obtained the following observation in the allowed parameter space : ( i ) in the nmssm the signal rate is always suppressed ; ( ii ) in the mssm the signal rate is suppressed in most cases , but in a tiny corner of the parameter space it can be enhanced ( maximally by a factor of 2 ) ; ( iii ) in the nmssm the signal rate can be suppressed or enhanced depending on the parameter space , and the enhancement factor can be as large as 7 .",
    "note added :   after we finished the manuscript , we noticed a preliminary result from the atlas collaboration @xcite , which excluded @xmath210 ( @xmath156 is defined in eq.[definition ] ) for @xmath211 .",
    "this means that in the middle panel of fig.2 the samples above @xmath212 for the nmssm will be excluded .",

    "<S> as the most important discovery channel for a light higgs boson at the lhc , the di - photon signal @xmath0 is sensitive to underlying physics . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we investigate such a signal in a comparative way by considering three different supersymmetric models , namely the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) and the nearly minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) . under the current collider and cosmological </S>",
    "<S> constraints we scan over the parameter space and obtain the following observation in the allowed parameter space : ( i ) in the nmssm the signal rate is always suppressed ; ( ii ) in the mssm the signal rate is suppressed in most cases , but in a tiny corner of the parameter space it can be enhanced ( maximally by a factor of 2 ) ; ( iii ) in the nmssm the signal rate can be enhanced or suppressed depending on the parameter space , and the enhancement factor can be as large as 7 . </S>"
