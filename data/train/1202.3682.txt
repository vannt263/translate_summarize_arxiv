    "the oklo natural reactors ( see e.g. naudet @xcite ) have proven to be one of the more sensitive terrestrial testing grounds for studying time variation of the fine structure constant @xmath1 @xcite or time variation of the dimensionless quark mass parameter @xmath6 of qcd @xcite .",
    "the position of the first neutron resonance in @xmath7sm strongly influences the effective cross section @xmath8 for neutron capture leading to burnup of @xmath7sm .",
    "the present day resonance energy e@xmath9=97.3-mev is well known , but in the past may have been different , leading to a change ( through @xmath8 ) in the isotopic abundances of various sm isotopes in oklo reactor wastes . from a modeling of the reactor parameters , and in particular from knowing the reactor temperature , thermal and epithermal neutron spectra can be derived which can in turn be used to predict whether the @xmath7sm cross section has changed since the reactors stopped operating . while the majority of oklo analyses have been consistent with no change , a positive effect continues to be argued for from astronomical observations @xcite .",
    "oklo analyses all reveal that the bounds on variation of @xmath1 depend significantly on the assumed reactor operating temperature @xmath0 . in refs .",
    "@xcite maxwellian thermal neutron fluxes were used , while in refs .",
    "@xcite several realistic models of the reactors zones were elaborated with the help of modern neutron transport codes . for zone rz2 , with indirect arguments , damour and dyson @xcite allowed for a broad interval of @xmath0 from 450 to 1000 c. y. fujii et al .",
    "@xcite took the interval from 180 to 400 c for zones rz3 , rz10 , while gould et al .",
    "@xcite preferred lower values from 200 to 300 c for zone rz10 .",
    "petrov et al .",
    "@xcite argued for the value @xmath10 c as the temperature value at which their model of the active core rz2 became critical .",
    "three studies have attempted to bound temperatures more directly using @xmath11lu/@xmath3lu thermometry .",
    "holliger and devillers @xcite , gave temperatures @xmath12 260 and 280 c for rz2 and rz3 , and recently onegin @xcite found @xmath13 c for rz3 .",
    "however , for rz10 , one of the most well characterized zones , hidaka and holliger@xcite succeeded in getting a result for only one sample @xmath14 c while for the other three samples only a ( surprisingly high ) lower bound , @xmath15 c , was obtained .",
    "obviously , the temperature @xmath0 of oklo reactors remains a very uncertain parameter and the results of ref.@xcite are especially puzzling .",
    "in what follows we will discuss some possible ways to improve the situation .",
    "+ in oklo studies , the effective capture cross section is introduced as @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the total neutron density , and @xmath18=2200 m / sec is the velocity of a neutron at thermal energy @xmath19 ev . as an integrated quantity , @xmath8 is not dependent on neutron velocity @xmath20 ( or neutron energy @xmath21 ) but if some nuclide , like @xmath11lu , has a neutron resonance close to thermal energy , @xmath22 may depend on temperature @xmath23 through a possible temperature dependence of the neutron density , @xmath24 .",
    "examples of calculated curves @xmath25 for zones rz2 and rz10 are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "also an effective neutron flux density is introduced as @xmath26 .",
    "this flux is different from the integrated true flux @xmath27 , but the reaction rate @xmath28 is the same since the average cross section @xmath29",
    ".    we will follow the description of the lutetium thermometry given by holliger and devillers @xcite . the first suggestion to use lutetium as a sensitive indicator of the temperature of neutron spectra in reactors",
    "was made apparently by westcott @xcite .",
    "the rare earth element lutetium has one stable isotope , @xmath3lu , with natural abundance 97.401 % , and and a second very long - lived isotope @xmath11lu with half - life t@xmath30 gyr and present day natural abundance 2.599 % @xcite .",
    "neither isotope is produced in the fission of uranium or plutonium .",
    "@xmath11lu has an exceptionally large thermal capture cross section , @xmath31 b @xcite due to a strong resonance at 141 mev .",
    "this leads to a strong temperature dependence in the rate at which @xmath11lu burns up . following neutron capture",
    ", @xmath11lu transforms into the stable nuclide @xmath32hf after the @xmath33 decay of the product @xmath32lu .",
    "neutron capture by @xmath3lu has two branches with much smaller cross sections .",
    "the dominant branch with @xmath34 b @xcite leads to an isomeric state @xmath35lu which decays to @xmath11hf with half - life of 3.6 hr .",
    "the minor branch with @xmath36 b @xcite leads directly to the ground state of @xmath11lu .",
    "while the large cross section for neutron capture in @xmath11lu serves to deplete the small fraction of @xmath11lu , the minor capture branch on the much larger fraction of @xmath3lu works to restore @xmath11lu . defining @xmath37",
    ", the important parameter determining the balance between depletion and restitution of @xmath11lu is then @xmath38 , the branching ratio parameter .",
    "is also used in the literature : @xmath39 . ] according to these evaluated cross sections @xmath40 at thermal neutron energies .    introducing the atomic number densites @xmath41 and the reaction rates @xmath42 ( the latter play roles analogous to the roles of decay constants in the radioactive decay ) and neglecting for now the @xmath33 decay of the stable @xmath43lu during the relatively much shorter time of oklo reactor criticality",
    ", we write the coupled differential equations for the time evolution of the number densities @xmath44 of our two isotopes of interest :    @xmath45    with initial conditions @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in these equations ,",
    "the subscripts 5 and 6 refer to @xmath3lu and @xmath11lu , respectively , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the present day natural abundances of lutetium isotopes and @xmath50 gyr is the date of the oklo phenomenon .",
    "this system of equations has an analytical solution which we write for the time duration @xmath51 of reactor criticality : @xmath52\\\\ n_5(t_1)=n_5^{0}\\exp(-\\lambda_{5}t_{1}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the two terms in the right hand side of eq.(4 ) represent the burnup of the initial @xmath11lu with cross section @xmath53 and its partial restitution after burnup of @xmath3lu with the partial cross section @xmath54 . taking the ratio and accounting for the @xmath33 decay of @xmath11lu after shut down of the reactor",
    ", we obtain the present day ratio of the lutetium isotopes in oklo wastes as : @xmath55 \\exp(- { dln2\\over t_{1/2}}),\\ ] ] which depends on the temperature @xmath0 through the temperature dependence of @xmath56 .",
    "the neutron fluence @xmath57 is a well characterized parameter in oklo studies .",
    "the effective cross sections @xmath58 and @xmath53 are calculable using known resonance cross sections of ref.@xcite together with neutron densities within realistic reactor models .",
    "the calculation therefore leads to a clear prediction of the present isotopic ratio if the value of the branching ratio parameter @xmath2 is known .",
    "the determination of @xmath2 has been the subject of considerable experimental effort in connection with astrophysical studies of the s - process in stars .",
    "the difficulty in making a precise determination arises from the fact that its value is obtained by taking the difference between two cross sections , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , of similar magnitude . in a 1988 summary of measurements @xcite , a value anywhere in the range 0.16 to 0.38 seemed possible .",
    "to address the problem , two precision measurements of the @xmath3lu total capture and partial activation cross sections at 5 and 25 kev were recently carried out @xcite .",
    "the conclusions of these studies were that @xcite @xmath60 at 5 kev and @xmath61 at 25 kev .",
    "these values are about a factor of two less than the value for thermal neutrons , 0.28 .",
    "such a big difference looks rather puzzling even taking into consideration a partial contribution of @xmath62-wave neutrons , and raises the question of whether the thermal value is actually correct .",
    "there is some experimental evidence for a smaller value .",
    "a spectroscopic study @xcite of thermal neutron capture found @xmath63 . also , the only neutron transmission measurement for which there are data with an enriched @xmath3lu sample , ( baston et al .",
    "@xcite ) , hints at a smaller value in the following way .",
    "the thermal capture cross section they determined , @xmath64 b , was based on subtracting a potential scattering contribution of 5.5 b from their measured total cross section . however , the potential scattering cross section is known today to be much larger , @xmath65 b @xcite . using this new value leads to @xmath66 b , and",
    "correspondingly a smaller @xmath67 b.    while this latter result has very large uncertainty , we believe there is reason to think the value of @xmath2 for thermal neutrons is not that well known , and merits further study .",
    "in what follows we evaluate oklo reactor temperature predictions for a range of values from 0.10 to 0.30 , and then focus on the most precise value measured to date , the 25 kev value cited above .",
    "to solve equation 6 , we first evaluate the effective capture cross sections @xmath8 for @xmath3lu and @xmath8 for @xmath11lu using the t = 20 to 500 c neutron spectra derived from mcnp calculations in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "the procedure was identical to that outlined there except here the lu - resonance shift due to a change in @xmath1 is taken to be zero .",
    "for @xmath3lu we include all resonances up to 49.4 ev along with two sub - threshold resonances and the strong resonance at 96.69 ev . for @xmath11lu",
    "we include all resonances up to 52.13 ev . in practice , the contribution of the @xmath68-mev resonance dominates for @xmath11lu , all other resonances contribute only a few percent .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the resulting cross sections are shown in table i. here we also include values for @xmath71 c and @xmath72 c , derived from a power series extrapolation of the 20 c to 500 c results .",
    "the lu isotopic abundance data for reactor zone rz10 are given by hidaka and holliger ( hh ) @xcite and are shown in table ii for four different borehole depths .",
    "we see @xmath11lu is strongly depleted in all samples although the ratio @xmath73 varies substantially , indicating , as noted by hh , heterogeneous operation of the reactor zone , or differences in isotope retention following reactor shut down .",
    "lacking detailed further information on this situation , it appears more useful to work with a meta sample averaged over the four samples that are available for analysis .",
    "this approach was shown to be successful for sm data @xcite .",
    "weighting each sample by its lu elemental concentration , we accordingly find the meta sample ratio @xmath74 .     for @xmath2 values 0.1 , 0.15 , 0.2 , 0.25 and 0.3 , and temperatures 0 to 600 c.",
    "the meta sample value is the horizontal line @xmath75.,width=480 ]    .",
    "note there is no solution above 500 c.,width=480 ]    this meta sample value can now be compared to the result of evaluating equation 6 for a range of @xmath2 values and reactor temperatures . a plot of this comparison is shown in fig . 1 for @xmath2 values 0.1 , 0.15 , 0.2 , 0.25 and 0.3 , and temperatures 0 to 600 c. of interest is that for a given @xmath2 only a small range of isotope ratio values actually lead to any solution at all .",
    "below about 350 c , the temperature is well constrained by the isotopic ratio data . at higher temperatures , however , the curves flatten out , leading to much reduced sensitivity , and above 500 c there is actually no solution .",
    "the intersection of the meta sample isotope ratio value with each curve yields a temperature prediction for the rz10 reactor .",
    "a plot of these intersection values is given in fig . 2 from which a temperature @xmath0 for rz10 can be read off if @xmath2 is known .",
    "as noted earlier , the evaluated thermal neutron energy value @xcite is @xmath40 which ( barely ) yields a solution @xmath5 c. the most accurately determined @xmath2 ( @xmath76 kev ) value of @xmath77 from the study @xcite gives a quite different value @xmath4 c.",
    "in this work we have identified the branching ratio parameter @xmath2 as a possible source of problems in extracting reliable temperature bounds from lutetium thermometry for the oklo natural nuclear reactors .",
    "our preference is for a lower value , but clearly there is impetus for additional study to constrain @xmath0 better .",
    "a first possibility is to carry out an improved measurement of @xmath2 at thermal energies .",
    "a ten percent measurement of @xmath2 is desirable and will certainly require carrying out a high precision total cross section measurement .",
    "an accuracy of 1% has been achieved at rpi @xcite for other rare earth element total cross sections , and similar accuracy should be feasible with an enriched @xmath3lu sample .",
    "the @xmath11lu isomer activation cross section is less critical but should also be improved bearing in mind that the differences in the existing experimental values considerably exceed the reported uncertainties .",
    "there remains of course the issue of whether the meta sample , even though averaged over the samples of the rz10 active core , still deviates from the true value 2 gyr ago .",
    "post oklo migrations of elements in and out of the core have been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the apparent strong retention of other rare earth samples in the active cores would seem to argue against selective migration of lutetium alone , but additional samples and data would clearly be valuable in clarifying the migration issue .    finally there is the possibility that post processing of the lutetium isotopes has occurred due to other nuclear reaction channels .",
    "this has been a topic of on - going interest in astrophysics , where an excess of @xmath11hf in older meteorites had been a long standing puzzle .",
    "see thrane et al .",
    "@xcite for a summary of the current situation .",
    "it is now generally agreed that the excess is not due to an incorrect value for the @xmath11lu lifetime , but is instead due to excitation of the @xmath35lu isomer by gamma radiation .",
    "the source of the gamma ray flux is debated , but as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a cosmic ray spray from a nearby supernova about 5 gyr ago is a plausible mechanism .",
    "the fluorescence cross section for @xmath11lu isomer production has been intensively studied by a number of groups ( see mohr et al .",
    "cross section results in the literature vary by many orders of magnitude depending on the energy of the gamma radiation .",
    "although the gamma - ray fluxes in nuclear reactors are extremely low as compared to those in supernovae , additional measurements of the @xmath11lu photoactivation cross sections and calculations of gamma - ray fluxes in oklo reactors are still desirable for a better understanding of the oklo phenomenon .",
