    "it is a well established fact that hadrons produced in @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath2 colliders at high momentum transfers appear in well collimated bundles called jets .",
    "these jets are understood to proceed via a two step process .",
    "the first one , which is of a perturbative nature , relates to the formation of a parton shower following the underlying hard partonic interaction .",
    "the second , which is non - perturbative , is called hadronisation and relates to the way partons in the shower recombine to form colourless hadrons .",
    "hadronisation effects are expected to become smaller at higher transverse momentum scales .",
    "+ jet shapes @xcite are defined as the normalised transverse momentum flow as a function of the distance to the jet axis .",
    "they are considered to be a measure of the jet internal structure .",
    "thus , at high energies , they are sensitive to the amount of final state radiation .",
    "+ recently , the atlas collaboration has published data on @xmath1-jet and light jet shapes measured in @xmath0 final states @xcite . here",
    "@xmath1-jets arise from the decays @xmath9 in both the single - lepton and dilepton modes .",
    "light jets are studied in the single lepton channel , where one @xmath10 is decaying leptonically and the second one hadronically .",
    "it is found that @xmath1-jets are broader than light jets .",
    "+ this is understood to be due to the fact that the angular radiation pattern for a @xmath1-quark is significantly different than that of a light - quark due to the heavier mass of the former .",
    "these effects were thoroughly studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for the full angular range subtended from the direction of motion of the @xmath1-quark .",
    "+ indeed , for a parton branching @xmath11 , the invariant mass of the decay products can be written as @xmath12 in the regime where the quark mass is negligible compared to its energy scale . here",
    "@xmath13 is the angle formed by the 3-momenta of the final - state quark and the radiated gluon . in the collinear limit ,",
    "valid for the jet cone region , one can expand the cosine as a taylor series and easily obtain the relation @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is the fraction of energy carried by the gluon ( @xmath16 )",
    "[ eq : anglemass ] suggests that there is a direct relationship between the mass of the branching parton and the angular distribution of the resulting products around the jet axis . for light - quark jets , the dominant effect on the opening angle described by eq .",
    "[ eq : anglemass ] arises from the gluon energy fraction @xmath17 . on the other hand , the opening angle in @xmath1-jets",

[ eq : gluonprob ] , @xmath21 corresponds to the energy of the radiated gluon . from here",

    "alternatively , light - quark jets are selected as the pair of jets which , not containing @xmath36-hadrons closer than @xmath37 to the jet axis , have the closest invariant mass to the nominal @xmath10 boson mass @xmath38 .",

    "a simultaneous determination of both parameters is not possible because a variation of one of them can be compensated by an opposite variation of the other one , leading to a set of degenerate minima in the plane @xmath40 .",

    "this tune incorporates a new colour reconnection model , which assumes an enhanced amount of colour connections between partons with respect to the nominal tune a sample .",
    "figure [ fig : cr ] shows that the effect of the new cr modelling is to increase the energy deposit on the jet cores on about 2% .",

    "to this end , the full set of @xmath5 variations have been generated again using the values of @xmath4 which define the envelope of its determination .",
    "because the value obtained in section [ seclambda ] was @xmath87 , the full scan on @xmath5 variations has been repeated using the values @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which define the endpoints of the interval in which @xmath4 can vary due to its experimental uncertainty .",
    "this is done in this way , instead of simply shifting each theoretical prediction by the nominal variation on the jet shapes due to this effect because the jet shapes are highly dependent on both parameters @xmath5 and @xmath4 at the same time . to keep track of this correlation",
    ", the full set of theoretical predictions has to be recalculated .",
    "+ the fits with the varied values of @xmath4 are then repeated , and the differences between both of them and the central value are taken as the systematic uncertainties on the @xmath1-quark mass , which are in principle asymmetric .",
    "it is found that the impact on @xmath5 of the determination of the parton shower scale is around @xmath100 at maximum , which represents the 1.2% of the @xmath1-quark mass . +",
    "another source of uncertainty related to the way in which @xmath4 is determined arises from the fixed order at which the running of @xmath27 is evaluated . to estimate this uncertainty",
    ", the value of @xmath5 has been extracted using the running of @xmath101 up to two loops , which is implemented for the herwig++ parton shower .",
    "the value of the two - loop shower scale was determined to be @xmath81 , and the corresponding value of the @xmath1-quark mass is @xmath102 .",
    "this value is to be compared with the value obtained for the one - loop running coupling in herwig++ , which was @xmath94 , and therefore gives a relative uncertainty of 2.7% . for the nominal value of @xmath103",
    ", this represents an additional uncertainty of @xmath104 , to be added in quadrature to the result of the propagation of the experimental uncertainty in @xmath4 , and therefore has a maximum value of @xmath105 .",
    "+ discrepancies between data and mc on the description of the transverse momentum of light jets can lead to a biased result on the value of @xmath106 . in order to check such effect , the light jet shapes were weighted and the fits were redone .",
    "these weights were estimated , in a very conservative way , matching the shape of the @xmath25 distributions of light and @xmath1-jets .",
    "the differences on @xmath106 with respect to the nominal value were found to be small ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "this difference is perfectly covered by the error on the fit procedure ( @xmath108 ) , thus ensuring the robustness of the @xmath106 determination . + as a further cross - check on the way in which @xmath4 is propagated throughout the analysis , the parton shower scale has been determined using the @xmath1-jet shapes obtained with the fitted value of @xmath5 .",
    "the results are found to be fully compatible with the previous results obtained in table [ tab : lambdaresults ] , which reassures us on the extrapolation of @xmath4 from light - jets to @xmath1-jets .",
    "+ after the evaluation of the theoretical uncertainties , the final value of the @xmath1-quark mass obtained in this analysis can be expressed as @xmath109",
    "this study presents a determination of the mass of the @xmath1-quark using jet substructure techniques .",
    "it is found that the angular screening effects which were predicted in @xcite are confirmed and consistent with a reasonable value of the @xmath1-quark mass parameter .",
    "the dead cone effect was similarly exploited in @xcite to determine the @xmath110-quark mass in @xmath8 collisions at hera .",
    "+ experimental uncertainties have been propagated using nuisance parameters for each source of uncertainty .",
    "this ensures that the correlations between all sources are explicitly taken into account .",
    "systematic effects on the theoretical distributions have also been studied .",
    "the modelling of the jet shapes by different monte carlo generators is the main uncertainty on this analysis , accounting for an 8% impact on the final value for @xmath5 .",
    "other systematic effects on the theoretical predictions have been studied , such as the amount of initial and final - state radiation , the colour reconnections and the uncertainty on the determination of the parton shower scale @xmath4 .",
    "our final result reads @xmath111 although there is a significant numerical similarity of this value with the value of the pole mass quoted by the particle data group in @xcite and also with the values obtained by the lep collaborations in refs . @xcite and @xcite , the value extracted here",
    "should not be confused with the qcd pole mass of the @xmath1-quark .",
    "it should rather be regarded as the on - shell mass parameter affecting the parton shower kinematics , as calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in any case",
    ", it would be theoretically very interesting to define a way in which the monte carlo masses for hadronising quarks can be related to the poles of their respective fermionic propagators .",
