    "experiments on , where @xmath7 is na , rb , or k , show a wide range of strongly correlated phases.@xcite , in particular , has attracted much attention following the discovery of superconductivity when water is intercalated into the system.@xcite the phase diagram , with doping @xmath8 , shows many interesting phases,@xcite including a ` curie - weiss metal ' , a type antiferromagnetism ( ferromagnetic layers stacked antiferromagnetically ) and an ` insulating ' phase seen only at @xmath9 .",
    "the latter phase is particularly puzzling as many probes [ including resistivity,@xcite optical conductivity,@xcite and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes)@xcite ] suggest that it is insulating , however , shubnikov - de haas oscillations are also observed,@xcite suggesting the state is metallic .",
    "the aims of this paper are to present a simple variational theory of , where @xmath7=na , rb , or k , and to attempt to reconcile these seemingly contradictory experiments .    in the co atoms form a triangular lattice and the simplest model of the band structure , a single band triangular lattice with nearest neighbour hopping only , gives good agreement with arpes experiments on .@xcite the doping of the system is controlled by the concentration of @xmath7 ions , @xmath8 , with the single band being half filled at @xmath10 and filled at @xmath11 .",
    "however , the @xmath7 ions order so as to minimise the mutual coulomb repulsion.@xcite therefore , the coulomb potential due to the @xmath7 ions is different at different co atoms and , because the @xmath7 ions are ordered , this gives rise to an ordered arrangement of potentials at the vertices of the triangular lattice .",
    "thus an effective hamiltonian for is the ionic hubbard model.@xcite    in addition to the interest in the ionic hubbard model is of significant interest in its own right .",
    "the ionic hubbard model on half filled bipartite lattices has attracted interest because it undergoes a transition from a mott insulator to a band insulator.@xcite furthermore , away from half filling and on frustrated lattices the ionic hubbard model shows a subtle interplay between charge and spin ordering and metallic and insulating phases.@xcite the hamiltonian of the ionic hubbard model is @xmath12 where @xmath0 is the hopping amplitude between nearest neighbour sites only , @xmath13 is the effective on - site coulomb repulsion between two electrons , @xmath14 is the site energy , @xmath15 annihilates ( creates ) an electron on site @xmath16 with spin @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "previous studies of this model on frustrated lattices included both analytical and numerical studies of zigzag ladders,@xcite dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) studies on infinite dimensional fcc@xcite and two - dimensional triangular lattices@xcite and exact diagonalisation on small triangular lattices.@xcite a more extensive discussion of previous work on the ionic hubbard model is given in ref .",
    "however , here we aim to provide a simple variational description that captures as much of the strongly correlated physics of this model as possible .",
    "the wide range of numerical techniques , described above , that have been applied to the ionic hubbard model have not , previously , been complemented by a commensurate effort to develop simple variational approaches .",
    "the history of the theory of strongly correlated electrons shows that progress has often been made when accurate numerical techniques are combined with such variational calculations .",
    "therefore , our theory , which can be straightforwardly generalised to other potential arrangements , lattices , fillings , etc . , is complementary to the previous numerical work .    in many different na ordering patterns",
    "are seen at different values of @xmath8,@xcite and each of these correspond to a different @xmath19.@xcite in principle , each of these different @xmath19 correspond to a different hamiltonian . therefore ,",
    "for simplicity and definiteness , we specialise to the hamiltonian relevant to @xmath9 .",
    "this model has two sublattices with different site energies , @xmath20 for a - sites and @xmath21 for b - sites,@xcite and with the sublattices arranged in stripes as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : unit - cells]b",
    ". thus the hamiltonian is @xmath22 where @xmath23 annihilates ( creates ) an electron with spin @xmath17 in an orbital centred on site",
    "@xmath16 belonging to sublattice @xmath24 and @xmath25 indicates that the sum is over nearest neighbours on the appropriate sublattices only .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is a natural instance of hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) for initial study on both theoretical and experimental grounds .",
    "experimentally , the behaviour of , particularly , is very different from that of with @xmath8 either a little larger or smaller than @xmath26 .",
    "further , many of the phenomena observed at @xmath9 seem to have a natural explanation in terms of the ionic hubbard model.@xcite we have previously studied the quarter - filled ionic hubbard model with a stripe potential by exactly diagonalising small clusters.@xcite we found a complicated interplay between the charge and spin degrees of freedom and between insulating and metallic states .",
    "we also found that these calculations provide a possible framework for understanding a wide variety of experiments on , , and .",
    "however , the most interesting regime ( i.e. , @xmath27 , see section [ sect : natheory ] ) , in terms of its relevance to experiments , is also the most challenging to investigate theoretically .",
    "this provides additional motivation to investigate the simpler mean - field theory presented below .",
    "comparison between our mean - field theory and these exact diagonalisation calculations will be made , where possible , below .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in the remainder of this introduction",
    "we briefly review the most pertinent experiments on and previous theories aimed at explaining these measurements . in section [ sect : formal ] we give the formal details of our theory and derive a set of self - consistency equations for the ground state .",
    "in section [ sect : numeric ] we report the results of numerical solutions of these equations and compare our results with experiments on and previous theoretical studies of the triangular lattice ionic hubbard model . in section [",
    "sect : conc ] we draw our conclusions . in appendix",
    "[ sect : non - int ] we describe the band structure of the model ( [ ham ] ) for non - interacting electrons .",
    "there has been far less experimental work on or than .",
    "therefore , in this section , we focus mainly on experiments on .",
    "the brief review below brings out two particular puzzles that theory needs to explain about the ground state .",
    "the first is how it is some properties are consistent with a metallic ground state and that others are more consistent with an insulating ground state .",
    "the second puzzles concerns how it is that the ground state has a large magnetic moment but a small amount of charge ordering .",
    "measurements of the relaxation rates for @xmath28co nmr found two distinct co sites , consistent with a charge ordered state.@xcite however , the authors noted that the degree of charge disproportionation is rather small .",
    "more recent @xmath28co and @xmath29na nmr measurements find no signature of differences in the charge state of the cobalt ions at the two distinct sites,@xcite suggesting that all the co atoms are in the charge state co@xmath30 , where @xmath31 gives an upper bound on the extent of charge ordering.@xcite this is in contrast , to the case of @xmath32 or 0.75 for which nmr clearly detecting a charge disproportionation.@xcite high resolution neutron crystallography detects small differences in co - o bond lengths , and an analysis based on bond valence sums , is consistent with a charge order of @xmath33.@xcite very recent nmr measurements were able to detect a very small charge ordering along the co(1 ) chains , below 51 k,@xcite but the authors do not discuss the magnitude of the difference in charge between two sublattices .",
    "as the temperature decreases the intralayer resistivity increases monotonically .",
    "no feature is seen at the magnetic ordering temperature ( 88 k , see below ) . above 51 k ,",
    "it is weakly temperature dependent with values of a few m@xmath34 cm,@xcite characteristic of a `` bad '' or incoherent metal which does not have well - defined quasi - particle excitations.@xcite below 51 k , the resistivity increases significantly , consistent with an activated form with energy gap of about 10 mev.@xcite although , it is usually stated that the transition at 51 k is a `` metal - insulator '' transition , we stress that it is really above 51 k is a bad metal and below 51 k the experimental evidence is not all consistent with the claim that is an insulator ( see section [ sect : metal ] ) .",
    "applying hydrostatic pressure causes the resistivity to decrease and the temperature where the resistivity becomes activated to increase . above about 13 gpa",
    "the resistivity has a metallic temperature dependence.@xcite in contrast , for @xmath8=0.75 is metallic at ambient pressure but becomes insulating above about 23 gpa .",
    "resistivity measurements found that the charge gap apparent from the resistivity was suppressed by magnetic fields parallel to the layers , larger than about 35 t , with hysteresis between 15 and 40 t , at low temperatures.@xcite a field perpendicular to the layers does not suppress the `` insulating '' state.@xcite    the thermopower and hall coefficient have small and weakly temperature dependent positive values above 100 k.@xcite however , they change sign near 88 k , obtain large negative values below 50 k , and then decrease towards zero at low temperatures .",
    "the latter is distinctly different from the behaviour of conventional semiconductors and insulators , for which the thermopower and hall constant both diverge as the carrier density vanishes with decreasing temperature .",
    "quasi - particle features are only observed in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) below about 150 k and reveal a fermi surface consistent with a hole - like band for a tight - binding model on the triangular lattice with an effective hopping integral of @xmath35 mev,@xcite about six times smaller than that predicted by lda calculations .",
    "a gap begins to open up over the fermi surface below about 60 k , and has a magnitude of about 6 - 11 mev at 10 k.@xcite    measurements of the frequency dependence of the conductivity show no evidence of a drude peak , consistent with the bad metal behaviour , seen in the static transport quantities.@xcite below about 100 k there is a loss of spectral weight at frequencies below about 100 @xmath36 , consistent with the opening of a charge gap .",
    "this leads to a peak in @xmath37 at @xmath38 @xmath36.@xcite in comparison for na@xmath39coo@xmath40 , with @xmath8 away from 0.5 , a drude peak is present at low temperatures and the total spectral weight of the optical conductivity scales with @xmath41.@xcite      shubnikov - de haas oscillations are observed in the field range of 15 - 30 t.@xcite a fast fourier transform of the oscillatory part of the conductivity has peaks at frequencies of 150 t and 40 t. these frequencies correspond to pockets with cross - sectional areas of 0.25 % and 0.06 % of the area of the undistorted hexagonal brillouin zone ( cf .",
    "figure 1d ) . the effective mass associated with these orbits are ( in units of the free electron mass ) @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "these measurements are extremely surprising given the range of other evidence suggesting that has an insulating ground state .",
    "muon spin rotation ( @xmath44sr ) experiments first saw evidence for magnetic order below about 86 k , and slight effects at 50 k and 30k.@xcite below 88 k , there is a splitting of nmr lines , consistent with the development of commensurate antiferromagnetic order.@xcite the change in the resistivity from a bad metal to an activated behaviour at 51 k has little effect on the magnetic state .",
    "elastic neutron scattering also detects long - range antiferromagnetic order below 88 k , with a magnetic moment of @xmath45 per magnetic cobalt ion.@xcite the authors interpret this order in terms of alternating rows of magnetic co@xmath46 and non - magnetic co@xmath47 ions .",
    "( i.e. , complete charge order ) .",
    "however , we stress that the observation of such magnetic order does not require charge ordering to be present .",
    "simple classical arguments suggest the magnetic moment should be less than @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the average number of electrons on the @xmath50 sublattice .",
    "hence , the charge disproportionation observed in the crystallography experiments discussed above , would imply a moment of about @xmath51 , about one quarter of the observed value .",
    "both the bulk magnetic susceptibility and the knight shift are weakly temperature dependent , with a peak around 300 k , and a magnitude of about 5 @xmath52 emu / mol.@xcite this suggests an antiferromagnetic exchange between magnetic ions of order a few hundred kelvin .      at other values of @xmath8 in",
    ", the ordering of sodium ions has been found to be important for the existence of various ordered phases.@xcite no insulating state is seen in the corresponding misfit cobaltates,@xcite which supports the claim that na - ordering is necessary for the insulating state .",
    "furthermore , cooling a material at different rates found that the presence of sodium ordering can drive an additional magnetic phase transition at @xmath53 and 0.85.@xcite      choy _ et al_. @xcite considered an extended hubbard model that included the coulomb interaction between electrons on neighbouring sites , @xmath54 , but neglected the na - ordering and the ` ionic ' term in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) .",
    "they argued that @xmath54 stabilises a charge ordered state and considered an effective low - energy hamiltonian for this charge ordered state . by fine tuning the parameters in their effective hamiltonian choy _",
    "et al_. were able to reproduce the observed temperature dependence of the resistivity and the hall coefficient .",
    "lee _ et al_. @xcite have studied via lda+u calculations that allow for the effects of na - ordering .",
    "they find a first order metal - charge ordered insulator transition as @xmath13 is increased .",
    "the charge disproportionation and the opening of the gap both occur at a single phase transition in this weak coupling theory .",
    "we have reported exact diagonalisation calculations for hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) of finite lattices.@xcite these studies suggested that , for parameters relevant to , the system is a covalent insulator , with little charge disproportionation and a small gap @xmath55 , rather than a charge ordered insulator , with strong charge disproportionation and a gap @xmath56 .",
    "this prediction is consistent with the experimental measurements of the charge disproportionation.@xcite further , these calculations predict a gap of the same order of magnitude as in seen in the arpes@xcite and the resistivity,@xcite predict the large moment seen in neutron scattering,@xcite and reproduce the main features seen in the optical conductivity.@xcite zhou and wang@xcite also studied a model that incorporates the effects of na - ordering within the gutzwiller approximation and found it could explain many of the experimental observations .",
    "there has been significantly less work on and .",
    "lee and pickett@xcite have reported lda calculations for and compared these with equivalent calculations for .",
    "they found that the @xmath57 band is rather narrower in than and that the fermi surface is more complicated in as there are several small pockets along the @xmath58-@xmath59 line .",
    "they speculated that these pockets , some of which are quite well nested near the @xmath58 point , may lead to enhanced magnetic tendencies in .",
    "clearly an important question is : what parameters in hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) correspond to the various possible choices of @xmath7 in ?",
    "various atomistic calculations that address this question have been presented for @xmath7=na , but for other @xmath7 there are not yet suitable estimates .",
    "calculations@xcite on small clusters of give @xmath60 ev , @xmath61 ev , and @xmath62 ev . for bulk the lda yields @xmath63 ev @xcite and @xmath64 ev @xcite , and electrostatic ewald calculations give @xcite @xmath65 ev .",
    "furthermore , coo@xmath40 , which is described by hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) at half filling with @xmath66 , is observed to be a strongly correlated metal rather than a mott insulator.@xcite this suggests that @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the critical value for formation of a mott insulator on the triangular lattice.@xcite hence , realistic parameters for may be in the range @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "the negative sign of @xmath0 is natural if the hopping between co sites is dominated by the contribution from hopping via an intermediate o site . to leading order",
    "this gives @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the direct hopping between a co atom and a neighbouring o atom , @xmath73 is the energy of an electron in a @xmath74 orbital centred on a co atom , and @xmath75 is the energy of an electron in a @xmath76 orbital centred on an o atom ( note that one expects that @xmath77 ) .",
    "we now investigate paramagnetic phases of the @xmath78 limit of the ionic hubbard model by deriving a mean field theory using barnes - coleman slave bosons.@xcite the @xmath78 limit great simplifies the analysis and is not unreasonable in spite of our estimate , above , that @xmath69 .",
    "our previous exact diagonalization calculations@xcite show that , provided @xmath79 the physics of this model is insensitive to particular value of @xmath80 . specifically , our results for @xmath81 show only minor quantitative differences from those for @xmath82 .",
    "we begin by making the particle - hole transformation @xmath83 .",
    "we then introduce the slave bosons .",
    "following , for example , ref . , we write @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the completely antisymmetric tensor , @xmath86 annihilates ( creates ) a fermion with spin @xmath17 at site @xmath16 on sublattice @xmath24 , @xmath87 annihilates ( creates ) a boson , corresponding to a site that is doubly occupied by holes , at site @xmath16 on sublattice @xmath24 , and @xmath88 annihilates ( creates ) a boson , corresponding to a site containing no holes , at site @xmath16 on sublattice @xmath24 .",
    "if the number of holes is less than or equal to the number of lattice sites and @xmath89 there is zero weight for configurations containing any sites doubly occupied ( with holes ) in the the ground state or any excited states at finite energy above the ground state .",
    "therefore , @xmath90 can be ` deleted ' giving us @xmath91 it is clear from eq .",

    "further calculations will be required to discover whether this proposal is indeed supported by the theory of the ionic hubbard model .",
    "the fundamental definition of a metal is a substance with charge carrying excitations at arbitrarily low energies above the ground state . in most situations",
    "it follows that the resistivity monotonically increases with temperature as increasing the temperature decreases the quasiparticle lifetime . however , this is not necessarily the case .",
    "for example , in many strongly correlated systems , such as the organic superconductors,@xcite the charge transport is incoherent at high temperatures - this leads to a resistivity with a broad maximum slightly above the temperature where quasiparticle coherence is lost.@xcite above , we have shown that the slave boson theory of hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) produces two bands .",
    "we will assume some features of these bands survive even in the exact solution even if the simple single particle states , of the slave boson theory , do not .",
    "the antibonding band is narrow and it is likely that coherent quasiparticles do not emerge from these states until quite low temperatures . within slave boson theories",
    "the coherence temperature can be estimated from the bose condensation temperature , @xmath221 of the slave bosons,@xcite which , in 2d , is proportional to the density of bosons , @xmath222 . for @xmath191",
    "there are 0.993 quasiholes per unit cell in the antibonding band , corresponding to @xmath223 , and the density of bosons decreases as is increased , going to zero at = 1.5 . estimating the bose condensation temperature ( cf",

    "however it is well known that these simple formulae dramatically overestimate the coherence temperature as they neglect gauge fluctuations.@xcite thus the coherence temperature ( @xmath229  k ) is expected to be extremely low in the experimentally relevant parameter regime .",
    "this low coherence temperature is consistent with the observed incoherent transport evident from the resistivity above @xmath23051 k. as the temperature is lowered below 51 k the resistivity rises rapidly , suggesting that a gap opens .",
    "the slave boson calculations do not predict a true gap unless @xmath173 .",
    "experiments observe magnetic ordering,@xcite which we have not considered here , below 88 k , but , as the gap does not appear to open until 51 k , one can not conclude that the magnetic order causes the gap to open .",
    "however , previous exact diagonalisation calculations@xcite suggest that in the experimentally relevant parameter regime , @xmath27 , non - local correlations , not captured by our mean field treatment , drive the formation of a covalent insulator .",
    "we propose that a gap opens on the antibonding band at 51 k due to non - local correlations , analogous to the covalent insulator .",
    "but , we also propose that the bonding band remains ungapped .",
    "this proposal is rather similar to the theory of the orbital - selective mott transition .",
    "the question of whether , in multi - band systems , one band can becoming insulating , due to electronic correlations , while others remain metallic has been extensively discussed recently,@xcite motivated , in part , by the volume collapse in ce ( ref . ) , the heavy fermion behaviour of ca@xmath231sr@xmath232ruo@xmath233 ( ref . ) and the nodal  anti - nodal differentiation in the cuprates.@xcite although the debate is ongoing , the current theoretical consensus is that orbital - selective mott transitions can occur for some parameter regimes of some models.@xcite therefore , testing our proposed picture will require calculations beyond the mean - field slave - boson theory presented above .    given the important differences between the current mean field calculations and our previous exact diagonalisation calculations , particularly the critical value of for the metal - insulator transition , it is important to ask , whether this explanation is likely to hold in the exact solution and , more importantly , for the real material .",
    "firstly , we note that the real space charge disproportionation calculated from our mean field theory is in very good agreement with exact diagonalisation calculations in the experimentally relevant regime .",
    "this gives one hope that the filling of the bands calculated from the mean field theory may also be reasonable ( although non - local coulomb correlations could cause additional hybridisation effects , cf . ref . ) .",
    "secondly , we note that the finite size clusters that were , necessarily , studied in the exact diagonalisation calculations mean that it is extremely difficult to accurately study the bonding band . taking a , typical , 18 site ( 9 unit cell ) cluster ,",
    "a density of 0.007 holes per unit cell means that one would expect less than 1/16@xmath234 of a hole in the bonding band in the exact diagonalisation calculation .",
    "however , exact diagonalisation calculations do accurately reproduce the band filling of the analytical exact solution for @xmath115.@xcite therefore , it is not clear , at present , whether the exact diagonalisation calculations can resolve the tiny hole pockets suggested by our calculations and the quantum oscillation experiments .    as the exact diagonalisation calculations do not rule out the possibility that small weakly correlated fermi pockets containing a tiny number of charge carries remain even in the low temperature ` insulating ' state , let us briefly discuss how this would produce a consistent explanation of the experiments on .",
    "it is important to note that the two bands act as parallel channels for charge transport . above 51 k charge transport in the antibonding band will be incoherent ( assuming the coherence temperature @xmath235 k , as we have argued above ) and the resistivity in this channel can be estimated to be @xmath236 , where @xmath237 is the interlayer spacing , i.e. , at or above the mott - ioffe - regel limit . below 51 k a gap opens on the antibonding band , but as the gap is small , @xmath238 ( ref . )",
    "the resistivity in the antibonding channel is not increased by orders of magnitude from the resistivity value in the incoherent metallic state . however , because of the extremely low charge carrier concentration in the bonding band ( metallic channel ) the contribution of the bonding band to the conductivity will be even smaller than that of the antibonding band ( incoherent / insulating channel )",
    ". therefore the metallic channel will be unable to ` short circuit ' the incoherent / insulating channel .",
    "this contention is supported by the fact that even above 51 k the resistivity is larger than the mott - ioffe - regel limit .",
    "thus the observation that the resistivity decreases with increasing temperature is not necessarily inconsistent with the observation of quasiparticles in quantum oscillation experiments .",
    "foo _ et al_. @xcite found that the conductivity , @xmath17 , of na@xmath239coo@xmath40 is very similar to that of na@xmath240coo@xmath40 and that both of these are an order of magnitude larger than the conductivity of . as @xmath241",

    "we have presented a mean - field slave boson theory of the ionic hubbard model on the triangular lattice with alternating stripes of site energy .",

    "calculations beyond the mean field slave boson calculations , which we have presented above , will be required to test this picture .",
