    "in materials with at least partially ionic bonding character , most notably halides and oxides , charge excitations can couple to lattice modes leading to the formation of polarons @xcite . in the limit where the coupling between charge excitations and phonons is strong one obtains so - called small or holstein polarons @xcite , which are characterized by very large but localized lattice distortions .",
    "their motion can be considered classical @xcite and typically exhibits an exponential temperature dependence . as a result the presence of polarons usually implies low mobilities , which are detrimental for many applications .    perovskite oxides exhibit a broad variety of interesting phenomena including but not limited to ferroelectricity , multiferroicity , strong correlation , and low - dimensional electron gases .",
    "applications are abundant as well as they are being used for example in electronics , catalysis , and thermoelectrics .",
    "polaronic effects in these materials have been discussed for some time @xcite and have also been investigated theoretically @xcite . while the existence of `` bound '' small hole polarons , to ti@xmath4 . ] which are associated for example with acceptor defects in oxides , is well established the presence of `` free '' ( or self - trapped ) polarons in oxides , which are naturally also much harder to observe , has been doubted @xcite . by contrast",
    "earlier computational studies did identify polarons in batio@xmath0  based on embedded cluster hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations @xcite and srtio@xmath0  based on a suitably parametrized many - body model hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this provides the motivation for the present work , in which we explore self - trapped hole ( sth ) polarons in three prototypical oxidic perovskites , srtio@xmath0 , batio@xmath0 , and pbtio@xmath0 . as will be discussed in detail below the description of polaronic effects",
    "is sensitive to the level of theory that is being employed .",
    "we therefore compare different techniques and carefully assess their respective predictiveness .",
    "we find that self trapped polarons are energetically favorable in both srtio@xmath0  and batio@xmath0  but not in pbtio@xmath0 .",
    "the formation energies for small polarons in the first two materials are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , while the associated lattice distortions are less than 0.12  for individual atoms .",
    "the lack of spontaneous sth formation in pbtio@xmath0  can be traced to the strong coupling between pb @xmath2 and o @xmath3 states , which raises the valence band maximum .",
    "the observed correlation between sth formation energies and vbm position suggests a simple approximate predictor for sth formation in this class of materials .    in the following section",
    "we discuss shortcomings of common electronic structure methods such as density functional theory ( dft ) and hf as well as related approaches with respect to the description of polarons .",
    "in particular we argue for the suitability of the dft+@xmath1 method for describing the systems of interest in this work . in sect .  [",
    "sect : results_forces ] it is shown that dft+@xmath1 functionals can be parametrized to reproduce the forces obtained from higher level ( and computationally much more expensive ) calculations based on hybrid exchange - correlation ( xc ) functionals . using a suitable parametrization",
    "we then explore in sect .",
    "[ sect : results_sth_structure ] the sth configuration space in the case of srtio@xmath0 , identify as well as characterize the groundstate configuration , and also verify the results by comparison with hybrid xc functional calculations . in sect .",
    "[ sect : results_linearity ] we then demonstrate that both dft+@xmath1 and hybrid xc calculations yield piece - wise linear behavior for the total energy as a function of fractional charge , which demonstrates their suitability for the present purpose and confounds their predictiveness .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "[ sect : results_bt_pt ] presents results for batio@xmath0  and pbtio@xmath0 , which are rationalized in terms of the valence band alignment between the different materials .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) based on semilocal xc functionals is a powerful tool for electronic structure calculations .",
    "it fails , however , to reproduce polaron formation in many condensed systems not only quantitatively but qualitatively @xcite .",
    "this shortcoming can be traced to the self - interaction ( si ) intrinsic to common semilocal approximations to the xc functional including the local density approximation ( lda ) as well as the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "the importance of si corrections in calculations based on semilocal xc functionals was first discussed by perdew and zunger @xcite , who also proposed a correction scheme that works well for atoms but falls short when it comes to molecules or solids .",
    "the issue has been addressed more recently in terms of variation of the total energy with respect to fractional changes in the electronic occupations @xcite .",
    "an exact functional should lead to piece - wise linear behavior with discontinuous derivatives at integer occupations @xcite .",
    "dft calculations based on semilocal xc functionals deviate from this requirement and overbind ( concave dependence ) , whereas hf calculations tend to underbind ( convex dependence ) @xcite .",
    "these opposite behaviors can be exploited in parametrizations of hybrid functionals that minimize the deviation from piece - wise linearity @xcite .",
    "the overbinding of lda / gga and associated lack of localization is also at the heart of another dft failure that is associated with partially occupied @xmath7-states in transition metal oxides , which are erroneously predicted to be metallic .",
    "the dft+@xmath1 ( originally lda+@xmath1 ) method @xcite , which was proposed to overcome this error , adds a hubbard - like term to the total energy functional and solves it using the self - consistent field approach in the independent particle approximation .",
    "hence , the standard dft@xmath8 approach treats the hubbard term within the mean - field approximation .",
    "consequently , this method effectively adds a fock - exchange term inside each atomic sphere to the standard lda / gga functionals .",
    "@xmath9 above the summation runs over sites @xmath10 and projection channels @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the occupancy of chancel @xmath11 at site @xmath10 .",
    "the resulting correction is quadratic in the parameter @xmath1 and it was argued that self - consistent @xmath1 parameters should correspond to piece - wise linear behavior @xcite .",
    "the dft+@xmath1 approach was originally derived to account for the extra on - site coulomb repulsion that occurs in strongly correlated systems due to the coexistence of atomic - like @xmath7 or @xmath13-electron states with delocalized band states . however , considering the mathematical similarity of the dft+@xmath1 method to hybrid dft techniques , it should in principle also be appropriate for treating atomic - like polaronic states in normal insulators , which often possess @xmath14-character , no matter whether they happen to be bound to point defects such as vacancies or have been self - trapped by lattice distortions .",
    "the hole states derived from o @xmath3 orbitals in wide band gap oxides constitute a large class of problems that fall into this category .    in order to establish a more detailed understanding of the applicability of the dft+@xmath1 method to the problem of polarons in insulators , we discuss here polarons in two classes of wide band gap insulators : halides and functional oxides . in halides the formation of an sth - centers , ref .  . ]",
    "occurs by dimerization of two halogen ions , which can be formally described as the reaction @xmath15 , where @xmath16 represents the halogen and @xmath17 denotes the band electron that is created in the process .",
    "the resulting hole is localized _ between _ the two halogens .",
    "by contrast in oxides hole self - trapping is a single - center process @xcite corresponding to the reduction of an oxygen ion @xmath18 .",
    "let us now consider a charge balanced oxide crystal comprising @xmath19 oxygen atoms , from which one electron is removed .",
    "sth formation implies @xmath20 whereas lda / gga yields @xmath21 .",
    "this is related to the lack of charge disproportionation in partially filled @xmath7-states for e.g. , for ions in solution @xcite and similarly originates from the overbinding / lack of localization in lda / gga alluded to above .",
    "this motivates the addition of a dft+@xmath1 term to the total energy functional where the penalty term is applied to the o @xmath3 states .",
    "this approach is similar to the potential operator defined in ref .  .",
    "in the present work we employ hybrid functionals as well as the dft+@xmath1 method , and check their predictions with regard to piece - wise linearity .",
    "it should be pointed out that hybrid functionals are more generally applicable but at the same time computationally much more expensive than dft+@xmath1 calculations .",
    "all calculations were carried out using the project augmented wave method @xcite as implemented in the vienna ab - initio simulation package @xcite using a plane wave energy cutoff of 500ev for volume relaxations and 400ev otherwise .",
    "we used the lda functional in combination with the dft+@xmath1 method .",
    "hybrid dft calculations were performed using the range - separated hse06 functional @xcite .",
    "let us first consider sth formation in the cubic phase of srtio@xmath0 , and determine the associated lattice distortion .",
    "while an _ a - priori _ assumption regarding the geometric structure or symmetry of the ionic displacements belong to the sth should be avoided an exhaustive search over configurations using a hybrid functional is computationally exceedingly prohibitive .",
    "lda / gga calculations on the other hand fail to produce sth formation all together , which is not surprising based on previous experience with sth formation in halides @xcite .",
    "in fact the forces computed within the lda differ substantially from those obtained from hse06 calculations as evident from the left most data points in fig .",

    "we used @xmath27 supercells and a @xmath22 monkhorst - pack mesh .",
    "for the final configuration calculations were also carried out using the hse06 functional .",
    "already for the lda+@xmath1 configuration the maximum force was less than 0.2ev /  .",

    "while the oxygen atom at the center of the sth configuration remains at its ideal lattice site the two nearest ti neighbors are displaced outward by 0.09  along @xmath29 and the four next - nearest o neighbors move inward by 0.12  along @xmath30 .",
    "note that overall the ionic relaxations are small , while the hole has been completely localized . this is rather different from most @xmath31-centers in halides , which typically exhibit lattice distortions on the order of 0.5  and above @xcite . as a result",
    "the migration of the sth involves small changes in the ion positions when the localized charge is transferred between nearest - neighbor oxygen sites .",

    "thanks to the emergence of a localized level we now have a system , for which we can explicitly study the variation of the total energy with fractional occupation as the localized level is gradually being filled .",
    "figure  [ fig : fracocc ] shows that the hse06 functional actually performs very well in producing a piece - wise linear variation of the energy between integer occupations . at the same time",
    "hse06 predicts a band gap of 3.1ev in good agreement with the experimental value of 3.25ev @xcite ( compare table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "this demonstrates that in the present case hse06 _ simultaneously _ provides a good description of the ideal and the self - trapped structure , confounding the suitability of this hybrid functional for the present purpose .",

    "<S> we investigate the formation of self - trapped holes ( sth ) in three prototypical perovskites ( srtio@xmath0 , batio@xmath0 , pbtio@xmath0 ) using a combination of density functional theory ( dft ) calculations with local potentials and hybrid functionals . </S>",
    "<S> first we construct a local correction potential for polaronic configurations in srtio@xmath0  that is applied via the dft+@xmath1 method and matches the forces from hybrid calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we then use the dft+@xmath1 potential to search the configuration space and locate the lowest energy sth configuration . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that both the dft+@xmath1 potential and the hybrid functional yield a piece - wise linear dependence of the total energy on the occupation of the sth level suggesting that self - interaction effects have been properly removed . </S>",
    "<S> the dft+@xmath1 model is found to be transferable to batio@xmath0  and pbtio@xmath0 , and sth formation energies from dft+@xmath1 and hybrid calculations are in close agreement for all three materials . </S>",
    "<S> sth formation is found to be energetically favorable in srtio@xmath0  and batio@xmath0  but not in pbtio@xmath0 , which can be rationalized by considering the alignment of the valence band edges on an absolute energy scale . in the case of pbtio@xmath0  </S>",
    "<S> the strong coupling between pb @xmath2 and o @xmath3 states lifts the valence band minimum ( vbm ) compared to srtio@xmath0  and batio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this reduces the separation between vbm and sth level and renders the sth configuration metastable with respect to delocalization ( band hole state ) . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the present approach can be adapted to study sth formation also oxides with different crystal structures and chemical composition . </S>"
