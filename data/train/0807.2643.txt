    "the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in oxypnictide phases , prototype lafeas(o , f ) by kamihara and co - workers @xcite has sparked widespread interest in establishing the physical properties of these materials and especially the mechanism for superconductivity .",
    "this interest has led to the discovery of a number of new phases including other oxy - arsenides that when electron doped have critical temperatures exceeding 55k , @xcite and hole doped superconducting phases including ( k , ba)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 , with @xmath1=38k @xcite and li@xmath2feas with @xmath1 of 18k .",
    "@xcite thus there are three families discovered so far : ( 1 ) the oxy - arsenides , spacegroup @xmath3 , with rare earth oxide layers separating the feas layers common to all of these superconductors , ( 2 ) the body centered tetragonal , @xmath4 thcr@xmath0si@xmath0 structure materials ( bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ) , where the feas layers are stacked so that the as atoms face each other and the ba atoms sit in the resulting 8-fold coordinated square prismatic sites between them , and ( 3 ) @xmath3 lifeas , which is like the oxy - arsenide structure but with the rare earth oxide layers removed and replaced by li ( see below ) , resulting in a large decrease in the @xmath5-axis spacing of the feas layers .",
    "stoichiometric ( undoped ) bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 shows a spin density wave ( sdw ) type magnetic order and a structural transition with similar ordering temperatures .",
    "this feature is common to most of these materials , including the oxy - arsenides .",
    "@xcite however , there are also some strong differences between properties of the oxypnictides and bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "most notable is the fact that with the exception of one report , @xcite the oxy - arsenide superconductors are generally electron doped , while ( ba , k)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 and li@xmath2feas are found to superconduct when hole doped .",
    "however , in both bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and lafeaso superconductivity apparently is associated with the suppression of the sdw .",
    "this is potentially of importance because there has been much discussion of the association between magnetic quantum critical points and high temperature superconductivity and in addition the specific spin fluctuations associated with the nesting that presumably drives the sdw have been studied as a possible pairing mechanism .",
    "@xcite    electronic structure studies , @xcite show that the fermi surfaces and band structures of these phases are qualitatively rather similar . in particular ,",
    "all the compounds show small compensating electron and hole fermi surfaces , but high densities of states .",
    "the hole fermi surfaces occur around the zone center , and are generally derived from heavier ( lower velocity ) bands than the electron surfaces , which are around the zone corner ( @xmath6 point in a primitive tetragonal zone ) . within band structure theories ,",
    "moment formation is governed by a stoner parameter , @xmath7 , which takes values of 0.7 ev to 0.9 ev for ions near the middle of the @xmath8 series ( note that the effective @xmath7 can reduced by hybridization ) .",
    "while magnetism may occur with lower values of the density of states , it must occur within a band picture if the stoner criterion , @xmath9 , is met ( the non - spin - polarized electronic structure becomes unstable against ferromagnetism in this case ) . here",
    "@xmath10 is the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy on a per atom per spin basis .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath10 for the undoped feas materials put them at the borderline of itinerant magnetism , and in fact they are near both ferromagnetism , as required by the stoner theory , and checkerboard antiferromagnetism , where nearest neighbor fe atoms are oppositely polarized .",
    "the ground states , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite have a magnetic structure that corresponds to condensation of an @xmath6 point ( zone corner ) sdw .    the electronic structures all show a strong increase in the electronic dos as the fermi energy is lowered into the heavier hole bands .",
    "this feature is quite robust in this family and is also the case for the corresponding phosphide compounds .",
    "@xcite importantly , this strong increase in the dos poses a conundrum because it means that within a rigid band picture hole doped materials would be strongly magnetic , and therefore would necessarily have very different properties , including superconductivity , from the electron doped materials . on the other hand , from an experimental point of view the generic phase diagram is much more symmetric , with an sdw and structural distortion near zero doping , with apparently non - magnetic , and superconducting states for both hole and electron doped materials .",
    "here we investigate this issue using calculations for doped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and lifeas within the virtual crystal approximation .",
    "this is an average potential approximation , which is beyond the rigid band method .",
    "we in fact find strong non - rigid band effects that leave only a weak doping level dependence to the @xmath10 and provide a plausible explanation for the generic phase diagram of this family of materials .",
    "the present calculations were performed within the local density approximation ( lda ) using the general potential linearized augmented planewave ( lapw ) method , @xcite similar to those reported previously for lafeaso .",
    "@xcite lapw sphere radii of 1.8 @xmath11 , 2.2 @xmath11 , 2.1 @xmath11 , and 2.1 @xmath11 were used for li , ba , fe and as , respectively . the effect of doping was included by the virtual crystal approximation , by varying the nuclear charge of ba or li .",
    "importantly , the internal parameters , including the as and li positions , were relaxed independently for each doping level .",
    "we took the experimental tetragonal lattice parameters of room temperature bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 of ref . , and relaxed the internal coordinate of as using lda total energy minimization .",
    "the calculated coordinate is @xmath12=0.342 .",
    "this is noticeably lower than the reported value of @xmath12=0.3545 .",
    "in fact the as heights in these two structures differ by 0.16  , which as discussed below is outside the normal range of density functional errors and is significant for the electronic structures .",
    "we also did calculations with the generalized gradient approximation but find a similar discrepancy .",
    "similar discrepancies have also been noted in the lafeaso series .",
    "@xcite for lifeas , we used the experimental lattice parameters@xcite and relaxed the free internal coordinates .",
    "the experimental structure ( spacegroup @xmath3 , 129 ) shows two li sites : 2@xmath5 , which according to ref .",
    "is fully occupied , and lies above and below the centers of the fe squares opposite the as , as shown in fig .",
    "[ struct ] , and 2@xmath13 which has a reported occupancy of 0.1 in li@xmath14feas and lies directly above the fe .",
    "we performed total energy calculations for stoichiometric lifeas with li in the 2@xmath13 and 2@xmath5 sites and found that the @xmath15 site is favored by 0.52 ev per formula unit .",
    "accordingly , we performed our doping studies placing li in the @xmath15 site .",
    "we note that while this is the opposite choice to that made by nekrasov and co - workers @xcite , the electronic structure near the fermi energy is practically unaffected by this choice .",
    "in fact , when hole doped by li vacancies one may expect coulomb repulsions between the like charged li ions to favor partial occupations of the @xmath16 site , though always with a higher occupancy on the @xmath15 site , similar to what is found in na@xmath17coo@xmath0 . in any case , the insensitivity of the electronic structure to the li position supports the validity of the virtual crystal approximation .",

    "we do not find any instability against either a ferromagnetic or a checkerboard ( nearest neighbor ) antiferromagnetic state in the lda .",
    "the sdw state , which consists of lines of parallel spin fe atoms in the feas planes has a moment defined by the integral inside the fe lapw sphere , radius 2.1 @xmath11 , of 0.7 @xmath24 .",
    "as mentioned , @xmath10 is larger when the as height is raised to the reported experimental value leading to a more magnetic state . in this case , within the lda we find a very weak instability of the non - spin - polarized state to ferromagnetism ( 0.3 @xmath24/fe , 0.01 mev / fe ) . a stronger instability for the checkerboard antiferromagnetism ( 1.6 @xmath24/fe , 41 mev / fe ) and the strongest instability to the sdw , which is the ground state ( 1.75 @xmath24/fe , 92 mev / fe ) . for the experimental value of @xmath12 the state with ferromagnetic @xmath5-axis stacking of the fe in the sdw state has higher energy , and is therefore less stable than the state with antiferromagnetic stacking , by 3 mev / fe , while these two states are degenerate to the precision of the calculation for the lda as height .",
    "thus the lowest energy magnetic structure that we find is the sdw ordering in the fe layers , stacked so that fe atoms directly above each other in the @xmath5-direction are antiferromagnetically aligned .",
    "this is in accord with recent experimental results .",
    "@xcite the high sensitivity of the fe moment to the ordering and the fact that the sdw state is so much lower in energy than any other magnetic state strongly imply that the magnetism is of itinerant character with a spin density wave driven by the structure of the fermi surface rather than local moment physics associated with heisenberg type exchange couplings .",
    "these undoped electronic structures are similar to those obtained previously and show the generic features of the calculated electronic structures of the other feas materials  small fermi surfaces , with hole cylinders at the zone center and electron cylinders at the zone corner , high @xmath10 , and a strongly increasing dos below @xmath22 .",
    "the somewhat lower values of @xmath10 compared to lafeaso would place bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and lifeas further from ferromagnetism .",
    "this combined with the fact that ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are highly pair breaking for singlet superconducting states may partially explain why hole doping is effective in these non - oxide materials , but the large increase in the dos below @xmath22 works against this explanation taken by itself .",
    "in this section we report virtual crystal calculations for the two compounds .",
    "this approach differs from rigid band in that it includes the self - consistent rearrangement of the charge density , which is done in an average potential .",
    "this approximation is justified since the ba and li states do not contribute in any significant way to the band structure near @xmath22 and because the scattering due to disorder on the ba and li sites is expected to be weak in view of the fact that wavefunctions of the states near @xmath22 are primarily fe derived and therefore separated from the ba / li atoms .",
    "this is supported by the fact that , as mentioned , we find no noticeable difference in the electronic structure as calculated with the li atoms of lifeas in sites @xmath16 and @xmath15 .",
    "importantly , in the present context , we are able to relax the internal coordinates and in particular the as heights in the virtual crystal approximation",

    "[ zas ] . as may be seen , the as drops towards the fe plane as holes are introduced .",
    "this is as might be anticipated for a primarily ionic situation , since a more highly positively charged fe layer will be more attractive to as@xmath26 and since the effective size of transition element ions in solids decreases as the valence increases .",

    "we ascribe this difference to the fact that they used the fixed experimental as position for the undoped compound and did not relax the internal coordinates . in any case",

    "[ ba - fsdope ] and [ li - fsdope ] show the evolution of the non - spin - polarized virtual crystal fermi surface for the two compounds .",
    "as may be seen the basic structure of the fermi surface with hole sections around the zone center and electron sections at the zone corner is maintained for all the doping levels shown .",
    "the difference between the volume of the hole and electron sections is required to correspond to the doping level by the luttinger theorem .",
    "also it may be seen that the size of the electron sections changes at least as much as that of the hole sections ( note that in fig .",
    "[ ba - fsdope ] the top view emphasizes the flaring out of the hole fermi surface at @xmath18=0.5 , while the main cylindrical sections are smaller ) .",
    "this is contrary to what might be anticipated considering that the electron bands are more dispersive than the hole bands and therefore should change less and again shows the importance of non - rigid band effects .",
    "the condition for an sdw instability of the paramagnetic state is that the real part of the susceptibility , @xmath29 should diverge at the nesting vector .",
    "this function is given in terms of an integral over the fermi surface for the bare lindhard susceptibility , @xmath30 , with an enhancement factor that emphasizes peaks , much like the stoner enhancement of the pauli susceptibility for the ferromagnetic case .",
    "the interband lindhard susceptibility for an electron cylinder at the zone corner and a same sized hole cylinder at the zone center is a function peaked at the nesting vector , while if the cylinders differ in radius by @xmath31 , e.g. due to doping or extra hole sections , the function will have a flat cylindrical plateau centered at the former nesting vector with diameter @xmath32 .",
    "thus as the cylinders become mismatched in size the maximum value of @xmath30 ( the value at the nesting vector ) will decrease , while a region of high constant @xmath30 will develop within @xmath31 of the nesting vector .",
    "we calculated the lindhard function , setting all matrix elements to be equal ( i.e. constant matrix element approximation yielding arbitrary units ) .",
    "although the fermi surfaces are not perfect cylinders and there are multiple surfaces of different size , we do in fact find this behavior for lifeas .",
    "it is also the case for electron doping in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and to a lesser degree for hole doped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , where the peak in @xmath30 becomes broader and smaller but there is no clear plateau region . for both lifeas and bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 we find a decrease in the peak height of the lindhard function as we dope with holes .",
    "this explains why the sdw is destroyed by hole doping in these materials .",
    "there has been much recent discussion of the relationship between the sdw instability and superconductivity . within an eliashberg formalism involving spin fluctuations what enters",
    "the calculation of the pairing function is a double integral over the fermi surface ( like that in the lindhard function ) with a kernel containing the pairing interaction , @xmath33 .",
    "thus in the case discussed above , the interband superconducting pairing between the electron and hole fermi surfaces will depend on an integral over a range of @xmath34 of size comparable to the fermi surface size , while the sdw instability will depend on the peak value of @xmath29 ( in a real case spin fluctuations away from the sdw ordering vector will compete with the sdw so even for a given maximum value of the bare @xmath30 a system with a narrower peak will order first ) . in any case , if spin fluctuations associated with the sdw are responsible for pairing , one expects superconductivity to compete with the sdw and to occur on both sides of the region where the sdw is stable .",
    "what our results show is that the properties are much more symmetric between hole and electron doping than would be expected from a rigid band picture .",
