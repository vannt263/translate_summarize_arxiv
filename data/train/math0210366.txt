    "while the theory of special functions in one variable has a long and rich history , the growing interest in special functions of several variables is comparatively recent . during the last years ,",
    "there has in particular been a rapid development in the area of special functions with reflection symmetries and the harmonic analysis related with root systems .",
    "the motivation for this subject comes to some extent from the theory of riemannian symmetric spaces , whose spherical functions can be written as multi - variable special functions depending on certain discrete sets of parameters . a key tool in the study of special functions with reflection symmetries are dunkl operators . generally speaking ,",
    "these are commuting differential - difference operators , associated to a finite reflection group on a euclidean space .",
    "the first class of such operators , now often called `` rational '' dunkl operators , were introduced by c.f .",
    "dunkl in the late 80ies . in a series of papers ( [ d1 - 5 ] ) , he built up the framework for a theory of special functions and integral transforms in several variables related with reflection groups .",
    "since then , various other classes of dunkl operators have become important , in the first place the trigonometric dunkl operators of heckman , opdam and the cherednik operators .",
    "these will not be discussed in our notes ; for an overview , we refer to @xcite .",
    "an important motivation to study dunkl operators originates in their relevance for the analysis of quantum many body systems of calogero - moser - sutherland type .",
    "these describe algebraically integrable systems in one dimension and have gained considerable interest in mathematical physics , especially in conformal field theory .",
    "a good bibliography is contained in @xcite .",
    "the aim of these lecture notes is an introduction to rational dunkl theory , with an emphasis on the author s results in this area .",
    "rational dunkl operators bear a rich analytic structure which is not only due to their commutativity , but also to the existence of an intertwining operator between dunkl operators and usual partial derivatives .",
    "we shall first give an overview of the general concepts , including an account on the relevance of dunkl operators in the study of calogero - moser - sutherland models .",
    "we also discuss some of the special functions related with them .",
    "a major topic will be positivity results ; these concern the intertwining operator as well as the kernel of the dunkl transform , and lead to a variety of positive semigroups in the dunkl setting with possible probabilistic interpretations .",
    "we make this explicit at hand of the most important example : the dunkl - type heat semigroup , which is generated by the analog of the laplacian in the dunkl setting .",
    "the last section presents recent results on the asymptotics of the dunkl kernel and the short - time behavior of heat kernels associated with root systems .",
    "the aim of this section is to provide an introduction to the theory of rational dunkl operators , which we shall call dunkl operators for short , and to the dunkl transform .",
    "general references are [ d1 - 5 ] , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; for a background on reflection groups and root systems the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we do not intend to give a complete survey , but rather focus on those aspects which will be important in the context of this lecture series .",
