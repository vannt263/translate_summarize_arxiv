    "for an ever increasing variety of applications , an interesting problem to be explored is to model the debonding of a thin film from a substrate .",
    "if we consider a stretched film bonded to an infinite rigid substrate , the elastic energy of this film scales as its thickness . if the film debonds from the substrate , on one hand its elastic energy tends to zero , while on the other hand this creates a new surface and then an interfacial energy independent of the thickness .    in @xcite bhattacharya , fonseca and francfort",
    "examine , among other , the asymptotic behavior of a bilayer thin film allowing for the possibility of a debonding at the interface , but penalizing it postulating an interfacial energy which scales as the overall thickness of the film to some exponent .",
    "thus the energy they consider consists of the elastic energy of the two layers and the interfacial energy with penalized debonding .",
    "in this paper we deal with thin films connected by a hyperplane ( sieve plane ) through a periodically distributed contact zone .",
    "thus we see the debonding as the effect of the _ weak interaction _ of the two thin films through this contact zone and we recover the interfacial energy term by a limit procedure .",
    "since we are mainly interested in describing the interaction phenomenon due to the presence of the sieve , we make a simplification choosing two thin films having the same elastic properties ( for a generalization to the case of two different materials interacting , we refer the reader to @xcite ) .",
    "consider a nonlinear elastic @xmath0-dimensional bilayer thin film of thickness @xmath1 with layers connected through @xmath3-dimensional balls @xmath9 centered in @xmath10 , @xmath11 and with radius @xmath12 .",
    "thus the investigated elastic body occupies the reference configuration parametrized as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a bounded open subset of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "[ fig1 ]    in the nonlinear membrane theory setting the ( scaled ) elastic energy associated to the material modelled by @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the deformation field and @xmath22 is the stored energy density .",
    "the @xmath23-convergence approach has been used successfully in recent years to rigorously obtain limit models for various dimensional reductional problems ( see for example @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we study the multiscale asymptotic behavior of ( [ energia ] ) via @xmath24-convergence , as @xmath2 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 tend to zero , assuming that @xmath25 , @xmath26 and where @xmath27 is a borel function satisfying a growth condition of order @xmath28 , with @xmath29 . the case @xmath30 requires a further appropriate analysis and it can not be easily derived from @xmath31 by slight changes .",
    "unfortunately , three dimensional linearized elasticity falls into this framework .",
    "since the sieve @xmath32 is not a part of the domain @xmath19 , for any fixed @xmath33 we have no information on the admissible deformation across part of the mid - section @xmath34 .",
    "this possible lack of regularity might produce , in the limit , the above mentioned debonding and correspondingly an interfacial energy depending on the jump of the limit deformation .",
    "moreover , we expect that this interfacial energy will depend on the scaling of the radius of the connecting zones with respect to the period of their distribution and the thickness of the thin film .",
    "the cases @xmath35 and @xmath36 have been studied by ansini @xcite who proved that , to recover a non trivial limit model ; _ i.e. , _ to obtain a limit model remembering the presence of the sieve , the meaningful radius ( or critical size ) of the contact zones must be of order @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "in fact a different choice should lead in the limit to two decoupled problems ( if @xmath8 tends to zero faster than the critical size ) or to the same result that is obtained without the presence of connecting zones in the mid - section ( if @xmath8 tends to zero more slowly than the critical size ) .",
    "the proofs of the @xmath24-convergence results in @xcite ( see theorems 3.2 and 8.2 therein ) are based on a technical lemma ( @xcite , lemma 3.4 ) that allows to modify a sequence of deformations @xmath39 with equi - bounded energy , on a suitable @xmath0-dimensional spherical annuli surrounding the balls @xmath9 without essentially changing their energies , and to study the behavior of the energies along the new modified sequence . both in the case @xmath35 and @xmath36 the @xmath24-limits consist of three terms .",
    "the first two terms represent the contribution of the new sequence far from the balls @xmath9 ; more precisely , they are the @xmath24-limits of two problems defined separately on the upper and lower part ( with respect to the ` sieve plane ' ) of the considered domain .",
    "the third term describes the contribution near the balls @xmath9 through a nonlinear capacitary - type formula that is the same for both @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the equality of the two formulas is due to the fact that the radii of the annuli suitably chosen to separate the two contributions are less than @xmath40 , with @xmath41 an arbitrary small positive constant .",
    "in fact as a consequence , all constructions can be performed in the interior of the domain , and the same procedure yielding the nonlinear capacitary - type formula , applies for @xmath35 and for @xmath36 as well .",
    "the cases @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be treated in the same way .",
    "this approach follows the method introduced by ansini - braides in @xcite where the asymptotic behavior of periodically perforated nonlinear domains has been studied ; in particular , lemma 3.4 in @xcite is a suitable variant , for the sieve problem , of lemma 3.1 in @xcite .    for other problems related to this subject",
    ", we refer the reader to attouch - damlamian - murat - picard @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , attouch - picard @xcite , conca @xcite , del vecchio @xcite and sanchez - palencia @xcite , among others .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on the case @xmath44 . as in @xcite",
    ", we expect the existence of a critical radius @xmath45 for which the limit model is nontrivial but now we expect also to find different limit regimes depending on the mutual vanishing rate of @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "moreover lemma 3.4 in @xcite can not be directly applied to our setting since the spherical annuli surrounding the connecting zones @xmath9 as above , are well contained in a strip of thickness @xmath40 but not in @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "however , we are able to modify lemma 3.4 in @xcite by considering , instead of spherical annuli , suitable cylindrical annuli of thickness of order @xmath7 ( see lemma [ important ] and lemma [ important+equiint ] ) .    as a consequence , also in this case the asymptotic analysis of ( [ energia ] ) as @xmath2 , @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    "tend to zero can be carried on studying separately the energy contributions far from and close to @xmath9 ; we get three terms in the limit .",
    "the first two terms still describe the contribution ` far ' from the connecting zones ; _ i.e. , _ they are the @xmath24-limits of the two dimensional reduction problems defined by @xmath48 while the third term , arising in the limit from the energy contribution close to the connecting zones , represents the asymptotic memory of the sieve : it is the above mentioned interfacial energy .",
    "the main results of this paper are stated in theorem [ abz ] and theorem [ abz2 ] . in theorem [ abz ]",
    "we prove a @xmath24-convergence result for the sequence of functionals ( [ energia ] ) while in theorem [ abz2 ] we give an explicit characterization of the interfacial energy term occurring in the @xmath24-limit .",
    "more precisely , for every sequence @xmath49 converging to zero , we set @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 up to subsequence we can define @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the @xmath0-quasiconvexification of @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath56 $ ] and @xmath57 then @xmath58 @xmath24-converges to @xmath59 on @xmath60 with respect to the convergence introduced in definition [ conv ] , where @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the @xmath3-quasiconvexification of @xmath63 and @xmath64 is a locally lipschitz continuous function for any @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "similarly , if @xmath66 and @xmath67 then we still have @xmath24-convergence , as above , to @xmath68 on @xmath60 .    for any @xmath65 $ ] ,",
    "@xmath69 is described by the following nonlinear capacitary - type formulas :    \\(1 ) if @xmath70 , then @xmath71 where again , @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the @xmath3-quasiconvexification of @xmath74 ,    \\(2 ) if @xmath75 , then @xmath76    \\(3 ) if @xmath77 , then @xmath78 where @xmath79 .    before giving a brief heuristic description of each regime , we want to point out that whatever the value of @xmath80 is , the interfacial energy density @xmath69 corresponds to a cohesive interface where the surface energy increases continuously from zero with the jump in the deformation across the interface .",
    "\\(1 ) the case @xmath70 corresponds to @xmath81 , thus we expect @xmath82 to depend only on @xmath83 . in this case",
    "we have a separation of scales effect .",
    "we first consider @xmath82 and @xmath83 as ` fixed ' and let @xmath84 tend to zero as if we were dealing with two pure dimensional reduction problems stated separately on the upper and lower part ( with respect to the sieve plane ) of @xmath85 .",
    "then this first limit procedure yields two functionals being both a copy of the functional in @xcite .",
    "since the two corresponding limit deformations @xmath86 and @xmath87 must match inside each connecting zone , the above two terms are not completely decoupled .",
    "we are then in a situation quite similar to that of @xcite , except that here both periodically ` perforated ' @xmath3-dimensional bodies are linked each other through the ` perforations ' ; _ i.e. , _ through the holes of the sieve and not through the sieve itself .",
    "thus it is coherent to find a critical size of order @xmath88 .",
    "moreover this strong separation between the phenomena of dimension reduction and ` perforation ' leads to anisotropy as it can be seen , for instance , also by an inspection of the proof of lemma [ gliminfclose ] which shows that the extra interfacial energy term appears thanks to suitable dilatations having a different scaling in the in - plane and transverse variables .",
    "finally we note that the formula for @xmath89 is given in terms of a ` le dret - raoult type ' functional involving the limit of the right capacitary scaling ( that is , involving the function @xmath90 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) the case @xmath75 corresponds to @xmath91 . in this case",
    "we expect that the critical size @xmath82 depends on both @xmath84 and @xmath83 .",
    "indeed , as already pointed out , @xmath82 is of order @xmath92 .",
    "note that for @xmath93 we recover @xmath38 that is the critical size obtained in @xcite ; moreover @xmath94 turns out to coincide with the function @xmath95 in @xcite ( see remark [ nadia ] ) .",
    "contrary to the previous case , now the isotropy is preserved in fact here the dimensional reduction and ` perforation ' processes are not completely decoupled : the reduction parameter @xmath84 is forced between both parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "this can be seen also by noticing that now the scaling leading to the interfacial energy is the same in every direction ( see for instance the proof of the @xmath24-limsup inequality ) .",
    "moreover now in @xmath94 the reduction procedure is not explicit but only witnessed by the boundary conditions expressed only on the lateral part of the boundary of the considered domain .",
    "\\(3 ) the case @xmath77 corresponds to @xmath96 . in this case",
    "the separation of scales effect does not take place and the two previous scalings turn out to be equivalent ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "moreover we find that the interfacial energy is continuous with respect to @xmath80 in the extreme regimes ; _ i.e. , _ @xmath98 as @xmath99 and @xmath100 as @xmath101 . finally , as in the previous case , the lateral boundary conditions are the only mean describing the dimensional reduction phenomenon in the procedure leading to @xmath69",
