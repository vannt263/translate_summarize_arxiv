    "in the absence of experimental evidence for supersymmetry ( susy ) , it is essential to constrain the parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) both at the susy - breaking and the electroweak scale .",
    "the underlying susy - breaking mechanism plays a key role in the phenomenology of weak - scale susy .",
    "gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) is an attractive scenario , where the breaking is mediated from the secluded to the observable sector through a gauge - singlet chiral superfield and @xmath0 quark - like and @xmath1 lepton - like messenger fields @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology is determined by the effective susy - breaking scale @xmath2 , the messenger mass scale @xmath3 , the messenger index @xmath4 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , @xmath5 , and the sign of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath6 .",
    "another free parameter is the gravitino mass @xmath7 , related to the susy - breaking scale @xmath8 and the planck mass @xmath9 through @xmath10 .",
    "a rather stringent constraint on the model comes from the theoretically robust inclusive branching ratio @xmath11 obtained from the combined measurements of babar , belle , and cleo @xcite .",
    "a second observable influenced by the susy masses and mixings is the electroweak @xmath12-parameter , where new physics contributions are constrained to @xcite @xmath13 as a third constraint , we require the susy contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath14 , to close the gap between the experimental measurements and standard model ( sm ) prediction @xcite , @xmath15 since the susy one - loop contribution favours positive values of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath6 @xcite , we do not consider the case of @xmath16 in our analysis .",
    "finally , we require the gravitino to be the candidate for cold dark matter in the universe , i.e.  its mass should be larger than @xmath17 gev and its relic density @xmath18 should agree with the current limit @xmath19 obtained at the @xmath20 confidence level from the wmap mission in combination with sdss and bao data @xcite . for a given scenario , the calculation of @xmath18 involves the gluino and gravitino masses , the relic density of the next - to - lightest susy particle ( nlsp ) , and the reheating temperature @xmath21 of the universe @xcite .",
    "for the latter , values of @xmath22 gev are preferred in scenarios with leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "the last constraint concerns the abundances of the light elements in the universe , which may be spoiled if the nlsp lives too long before decaying into the gravitino .",
    "we therefore require the nlsp lifetime to be shorter than @xmath23 seconds @xcite .",
    "we impose the above electroweak and low - energy constraints at the @xmath20 level on the minimal gmsb parameter space . starting from the reduced set of high - scale parameters we perform the renormalization group running with spheno 2.2.3 @xcite and compute the mass eigenvalues and the observables @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 with feynhiggs 2.6.4 @xcite . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show a typical scan of the @xmath2@xmath3 plane for @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 revealing that `` collider - friendly '' regions with small or intermediate susy masses are virtually excluded by the severe constraint from @xmath30 @xcite . the region @xmath31 is excluded due to unphysical solutions to the rge .",
    "although the minimal gmsb is known to suppress flavour - changing neutral currents and thus avoid the `` susy flavour problem '' arising naturally in gravity - mediated models , models beyond the minimal gmsb can reintroduce flavour - breaking terms at the electroweak scale @xcite . for our study",
    ", we consider the possibility of mixing between messenger and matter fields @xcite , introducing flavour violation either only in the left - left or both in the left - left and right - right chiral squark sectors depending on the nature of the messengers .",
    "we here focus on fundamental messengers inducing flavour mixing for left - handed squarks only . the complete analysis including antisymmetric messengers leading to flavour violation in both the left - left and right - right chiral sectors can be found in ref .",
    "note that we do not consider slepton flavour violation .",
    "the resulting flavour - violating terms have to be included in the squark mass matrices at the electroweak scale .",
    "since flavour mixing is less constrained between the second and third generations @xcite we do not consider mixing with first generation squarks .",
    "non - minimal flavour violation is then implemented through one dimensionless real parameter @xmath32 , that parametrizes the off - diagonal entries @xmath33 of the squared squark mass matrices in terms of the corresponding soft susy - breaking diagonal elements , @xmath34 .",
    "the diagonalization of these matrices leads to the physical squark mass eigenstates labeled @xmath35 for @xmath36 ordered by increasing masses . for a more detailed discussion of the implementation of non - minimal flavour violation in the mssm see e.g.  refs .",

    "the anomalous magnetic moment is @xmath45 independently of @xmath32 .",
    "contrary , the observable @xmath25 depends strongly on squark mass splitting and thus on flavour violation .",
    "the large experimental uncertainties , however , allow for rather high values of @xmath46 .",
    "the most stringent constraint comes from the decay @xmath30 , for which we show the branching ratio in the first panel of fig .",
    "the small experimentally allowed range , indicated at @xmath20 by two horizontal dotted lines , allows for two narrow intervals for @xmath32 .",

    ", we observe an important splitting between the lightest and the heaviest squark due to the increasing off - diagonal elements of the mass matrix .",
    "an interesting phenomenon of level - reordering between neighbouring states can be observed at lower values of @xmath32 .",
    "these `` avoided crossings '' are a common behaviour for hermitian matrices that depend continuously on a single real parameter . at the point where two levels should cross the corresponding squarks exchange their flavour content , which leads to an interesting phenomenology in the context of squark production discussed in sec .",

    "[ fig2 ] we show the cosmologically favoured or excluded regions of the @xmath7@xmath21 plane according to the constraints discussed in sec .",
    "we can not fulfill all the constraints at a time since the constraints on the relic density and nlsp lifetime are in conflict with high reheating temperatures @xmath22 gev .",
    "we therefore allow for lower temperatures and fix the gravitino mass to be of the order of @xmath50 gev , which satisfies the constraints for still relatively high values of @xmath51 gev .",
    "we finally present numerical predictions for the production cross sections of squarks and gauginos at the lhc , i.e.  for @xmath52-collisions at @xmath53 tev centre - of - momentum energy .",
    "unpolarized hadronic cross sections are obtained by convolving the relevant partonic cross section with the universal parton density functions ( pdf ) according to the qcd factorization theorem .",

    "[ fig3 ] , we show examples for squark pair production ( left ) , squark - gaugino associated production ( centre ) , and gaugino - pair production ( right ) for our benchmark scenario with flavour violation in the left - left chiral squark sector . a more complete compilation of cross sections including other benchmark scenarios can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we observe cross sections that increase with our flavour - violation parameter @xmath32 . this behaviour is explained by changes of the squark flavour content with increasing flavour mixing . for lower values of @xmath32 the squark @xmath54",
    "is mostly stop - like , so that its production would necessite a top quark in the initial state .",
    "however , for larger values of @xmath32 , @xmath54 receives a sizeable scharm content and , due to the non - zero pdf of the charm quark in the proton , the cross sections of e.g.  the squark pairs @xmath55 and @xmath56 increase .",
    "other production cross sections show sharp transitions in particular production channels at a precise value of the flavour - violation parameter , as can be seen e.g.  for @xmath57 and @xmath58 at @xmath59 .",
    "the two cross sections exchange their values , which is due to an `` avoided crossing '' occuring here and inducing the exchange of the flavour contents of the two squarks . for @xmath60",
    ", @xmath61 is purely sdown - like and the large down - quark density in the proton leads to important cross sections . at @xmath59 , however , the flavour content of @xmath61 changes and it becomes sstrange - like .",
    "the corresponding cross sections are then lower due to the smaller pdf of strange quarks .",
    "the squark @xmath62 receives the inverse flavour change from sstrange - like for @xmath63 to sdown - like for @xmath64 . in consequence , its production cross sections increase dramatically at this value of the flavour violation parameter .      the same phenomena are observed for the associated production of squarks and gauginos shown in the central panel of fig .",

    "however , squarks only appear as propagators in @xmath65- or @xmath66-channel diagrams , and the resulting sum over all mass eigenstates renders the cross section independent of @xmath32 .    concerning the production of gravitinos , which is potentially interesting ,",
    "unfortunately our scenarios featuring a rather heavy gravitino ( @xmath67 gev ) do not allow for observable cross sections at the lhc .",
