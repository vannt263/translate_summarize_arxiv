    "lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) is a direct indication of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",

    ". its origin may be the radiative effect of the neutrino yukawa interaction with heavy right - handed neutrinos @xcite .",
    "there are some other scenarios which naturally induce lfv , such as the two - higgs - doublet model ( thdm ) with general yukawa interaction , the zee model for neutrino masses@xcite and so on . in the low energy effective theory of such new physics models , two kinds of the lepton flavor ( lf ) violating couplings exist ; i.e. , those associated with gauge bosons and those with higgs bosons ( lf violating yukawa couplings ) .    in recent years",
    ", the higgs - mediated lf violating processes have been studied regarding the decay modes @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "their branching fractions are being measured at current and forthcoming experiments at the b - factories @xcite and cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "the higgs - mediated lfv have also been investigated in muon processes : the muon - electron conversion in nucleus is studied in ref .",
    "it will be explored at the muon to electron conversion experiment ( meco ) @xcite and the prism muon electron conversion experiment ( prime ) based on the phase rotate intense slow muon ( prism ) @xcite .",
    "all these processes are measured as a combination of contributions from the gauge boson mediation and the higgs boson mediation .    in this letter",
    ", we consider possibility of detecting the process of the lightest higgs boson decaying into a pair of tau and muon , @xmath12 , at a linear collider ( lc ) . there lfv in yukawa interaction can be directly studied by measuring the decay branching ratio of the higgs bosons @xcite when they are found . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the mass of the lightest higgs boson is less than about @xmath13 gev .",
    "it is promising that such a light higgs boson will be discovered at lhc .",
    "then its properties such as the mass , the width , production cross sections , and decay branching ratios will be measured extensively .",
    "the precision study of the higgs sector is one of the main purposes of a lc such as glc , tesla or nlc@xcite .",
    "the lightest higgs boson is produced mainly through gauge interactions at a lc . in the case of the _",
    "nearly _ decoupling region@xcite , the production cross section for the lightest higgs boson is much lager than that of the heavier ones .",
    "therefore , the lf violating yukawa coupling can be better tested from the decay of the the lightest higgs boson than that of the extra ( heavier ) higgs bosons .    at lhc , the extra higgs bosons ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) may also be detected in the mssm and the thdm as long as their masses are not too large .",
    "the higgs bosons are mainly produced through the yukawa interaction , so that the production cross section of @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be sufficiently large to be detected especially for large @xmath19 values , where @xmath19 is the ratio of vacuum expectation values of two higgs doublets .",
    "therefore , the decays of @xmath17 and @xmath18 may be useful to explore the lf violating yukawa coupling@xcite . the search of lfv via the higgs boson decay at a hadron collider is suffered from huge backgrounds , and it should be required to pay much effort into the background reduction .",
    "magnitude of the lf violating coupling in @xmath20 is constrained by the results from the measurement of lfv in @xmath1 decay processes .",
    "the most stringent bound comes from the @xmath21 measurement@xcite . in the framework of the mssm , the theoretical prediction on the branching ratio of @xmath22 can approach to the above experimental upper limit by adjusting the susy parameters@xcite ; i.e. @xmath23 several times @xmath6",
    ". when all the susy parameters are as large as tev scales , the lf violating gauge - boson penguin diagram decouples from the experimental reach , while the lf violating yukawa coupling does not because they depend only on the ratio of the susy parameters .",
    "we can then avoid strong correlation between the lfv mediated by higgs bosons and that by the gauge bosons . on the contrary , if the scale of the susy parameters is smaller than 1 tev , the higgs - mediated lf violating coupling is strongly constrained from the experimental bounds on the gauge mediated lfv processes @xcite . in such a case , the parameter choice which realizes @xmath24",
    "is already excluded by the data .",
    "we evaluate the significance of detecting the signal for @xmath25 at a lc .",
    "the higgs boson with the mass around 120 gev is mainly produced through the higgsstrahlung mechanism @xmath26 , when the center - of - mass energy @xmath27 is lower than about 500 gev .",
    "we can identify the signal event ( @xmath28 ) without measuring the @xmath1 lepton by using the information of the momenta for the outgoing @xmath29 boson and muon as well as the fixed beam energy @xmath27 .",
    "the momentum of the @xmath29 boson is reconstructed from those of its leptonic ( @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) as well as hadronic ( @xmath33 ) products .",
    "the most serious irreducible background is @xmath34 with one of the tau leptons going to a muon and missings .",
    "the background can be suppressed by appropriate kinematic cuts with the expected resolution of the momentum of the @xmath29 boson from the decay channels into @xmath30 and @xmath33 and with the beam spread rate of @xmath27 .",
    "we find that the significance @xmath35 can exceed 5 in the mssm scenario when the susy parameters are taken to be as large as tev scales . in the general thdm , the larger number of the signal events can be realized under the constraint from the perturbative unitarity@xcite , the vacuum stability@xcite and available data .",

    "we have discussed detecting the lepton flavor violating decay mode of the higgs boson @xmath5 at a lc .",
    "the effective coupling of @xmath7 is induced at one loop in the mssm due to the slepton mixing .",
    "we have studied the situation where the typical scale of supersymmetric parameters is as large as tev scale .",
    "the magnitude of the effective @xmath7 coupling can then be substantially large .",
    "consequently , the number of the signal event via @xmath218 can be large enough to be detected after the background is suppressed by kinematic cuts",
    ". the signal can be marginally visible in the mssm when the effective @xmath7 coupling becomes enhanced due to the large ratio of @xmath2 and @xmath111 , where @xmath111 is the typical scale of the soft - breaking mass .    when @xmath111 is greater than the tev scale , the lf violating processes associated with gauge bosons such as @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 are suppressed .",
    "in addition , the lf violating processes including the higgs mediation such as @xmath214 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 as well as the flavor changing processes such as @xmath224 are suppressed when @xmath87 is greater than about 300 gev@xcite . on the other hand , the branching ratio for @xmath5 does not decouple for large @xmath111 as long as the ratio @xmath225 is not small .",

    "the mixing angle @xmath60 is independent of @xmath19 and @xmath87 . for larger values of @xmath226 ,",
    "the bound from @xmath214 can be relaxed by the factor of @xmath227 ( cf .",
    "( [ lim ] ) ) , whereas the branching ratio of the @xmath5 can remain be larger than @xmath8 within the available experimental and theoretical constraints .",
    "therefore , the number of the signal in the thdm can be by a few order of magnitude larger than the possible value in the mssm .    in our analysis ,",
    "we have used the bound on the lf violating coupling @xmath228 from the current data of @xmath214 . in near future , if the bound becomes strong by a few factor , the number of the signal becomes reduced by the same factor .",
    "we have assumed some important numbers which are associated with the machine property for the collider and the detector of a lc experiment . the estimation of the number of the signal events and the reduction of the background events largely depends on the detection efficiencies of @xmath29 and @xmath2 , the resolution of the momenta for them , the rate of beam energy spread of the @xmath229 collision and the initial state radiation .",
    "our assumption for these numbers might be rather optimistic . on the other hand , the significance can be improved when direct detection of the tau lepton is taken into account . in any case , a more realistic simulation analysis is necessary to determine feasibility of the signal .",
