    "<S> this problem can in principle be solved by careful stabilization of the probe beam for its intensity , polarization , and spatial profile . in the present experiment , to achieve a better signal - to - noise ratio with only intensity stabilization , the probe beam has a strong intensity which causes the residual heating effect so that cooling during the imaging is required . </S>",

    "<S> the inherent non - destructive nature of the faraday imaging method originates from the dispersive character of a faraday effect , represented by the detuning dependence of the signal expressed by eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> the faraday signal , which is the interference term of eq .  , is inversely proportional to the detuning ( @xmath34 ) at a large detuning limit . </S>",
    "<S> this should be compared with the destructive effect of photon scattering rate @xmath33 by probe light , which is expressed by eq .   and proportional to @xmath35 at a large detuning limit . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , by taking a large detuning , we can improve the ratio of the signal strength to the destructive effect of the photon scattering in faraday imaging . in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the ratios obtained in this way are denoted by green squares . </S>",
    "<S> we also plot the ratios obtained by ensemble measurements as red circles . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction represented by a dashed line and in particular show the linear increase with the detuning , indicating that the faraday imaging realizes a single - atom observation with a reduced effect of photon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the saturation parameter at the detuning of @xmath37 corresponds to @xmath38 , almost half of the value of the typical fluorescence imaging . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be contrasted with the case of the fluorescence imaging where the ratio is constant on the detuning , and is not improved .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the faraday imaging with the pbs angle @xmath31 , we also demonstrate a different type of faraday imaging of dffi @xcite by setting @xmath39 in the setup of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the detuning is @xmath40 , which is the same as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure1](b ) of the faraday imaging . </S>",
    "<S> although this dffi signal looks quite similar to that of fluorescence imaging , the dffi signal originates from a dispersive interaction just like a faraday signal . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : figure4](b ) shows the measured psf , obtained by averaging about 30 individual atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the measured psf is well fitted with the theoretical formula given by @xmath41 and a green solid line in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we note that the dffi signal has a detuning dependence of @xmath42 at a large detuning limit , and has no non - destructive nature . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results in fact show the saturation of the ratio of the dffi signal to the photon scattering rate @xmath33 at larger detunings , consistent with the theoretical prediction , indicating that the dffi has no merit to realize a single - atom observation with a reduced effect of photon scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we demonstrate an absorption imaging by setting the pbs angle @xmath43 , which is the standard setup for an ensemble measurement . in this case , similarly to the faraday imaging , a probe light makes destructive ( and also constructive ) interference with scattered light . </S>",
