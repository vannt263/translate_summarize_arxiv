    "to explore the early evolutionary phases of galaxies is important to understand galaxy formation .",
    "@xcite predicted that the starbursts in primeval galaxies emit significant ly@xmath10 emission through the recombination of ionized hydrogen in interstellar matter .",
    "although many surveys attempted to discover such ly@xmath10 emitting galaxies ( ly@xmath10 emitters : hereafter laes ) , but did not succeed to find them for a long time . in late 1990 s , @xcite discovered laes with narrow - band filters for the first time .",
    "currently , numerous laes have been discovered at high redshifts @xmath11 by @xmath12 class telescopes with narrow - band filters @xcite . although the number of observed laes increases constantly , the nature of laes is still veiled .",
    "recently , surveys of laes in the various wavelength bands ( optical , infrared , sub - mm , etc ) have been performed actively @xcite , and have revealed that while many laes appear to be young and less massive , a noticeable fraction of laes possess much older stellar populations and larger stellar mass .",
    "we have not well understood how such two classes of laes are concordant with the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario . as for the physical origin of ly@xmath10 emission ,",
    "the cooling radiation from a primordial collapsing cloud @xcite , from a galactic wind - driven shell @xcite , or from star - forming clouds in a young starburst galaxy @xcite has been considered .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed a galaxy evolution scenario from laes to lbgs , based on a supernova - dominated starburst galaxy model . in this scenario ,",
    "laes correspond to an early evolutionary phase of @xmath13yr .",
    "also , @xcite have constructed an analytic model of laes in a @xmath0cdm universe , and found that if laes form in relatively low density regions of the universe and the duration of starburst is as short as @xmath14  yr , the spatial distributions match the weak angular correlation function of laes observed at @xmath8 . the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting for observed laes has shown that laes mostly have young average age ( @xmath15yr ) and low stellar mass ( @xmath16 ) , and are less dusty or dust free @xcite .",
    "these young laes are consistent with the picture by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "very recently , deep surveys of laes allow us to study detailed properties of individual laes . as a result",
    ", it has been revealed that laes have a wide range of age ( @xmath17yr ) , stellar mass ( @xmath18 ) , and dust extinction with @xmath19 up to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "laes detected in rest - frame optical / near infrared ( nir ) bands tend to have older age , larger stellar mass , and stronger dust extinction than laes undetected in those bands .",
    "thus , the picture of purely young starburst galaxies are not always reconciled with observed laes .",
    "so far , the physical reason has not been clarified for the existence of an old , massive , and dusty population of laes .",
    "the previous study has shown that a starburst - dominated galaxy can emit strong ly@xmath10 radiation in dust - free or less dusty environments @xcite . however",
    ", starburst galaxies can not be always laes in dusty environments ( e.g. ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ) .",
    "hence , what physical state corresponds to an old population of laes is an issue of great significance .",
    "some authors argue that the clumpy distributions of dusty gas is important for the transfer of ly@xmath10 photons @xcite .",
    "since ly@xmath10 photons undergo resonant scatterings on the surface of gas clumps , photons can easily escape from the clumpy media .",
    "such an effect provides the possibility of old , massive and dusty laes .    in this paper , we explore how a young and old population of laes are concordant with a hierarchical galaxy formation paradigm . for the purpose , we perform tree - dimensional cosmological simulations of dark halo merger in a @xmath0cdm universe , incorporating the prescriptions of star formation , spectral evolution , and dust extinction . throughout this paper , we adopt @xmath0cdm cosmology with the matter density @xmath21 , the cosmological constant @xmath22 , the hubble constant @xmath23 in units of @xmath24 , the baryon density @xmath25 , and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "to pursue the star formation history in the hierarchical galaxy formation , we simulate the merging history of subgalactic halos ( hereafter subhalo ) by three - dimensional cosmological @xmath27-body simulations . here",
    ", each particle is regarded as a subhalo that is supposed to consist of dark matter and baryons .",
    "we simulate @xmath28 subhaloes in a comoving volume of @xmath29 .",
    "the mass of a subhalo is @xmath30 .",
    "it is assumed that the star formation is triggered , when a subhalo accretes onto a parent halo .",
    "then , we trace the stellar evolution separately for individual subhalos using a spectral synthesis code pegase @xcite . moreover , we take into account the effect of dust extinction on ly@xmath10 emission .",
    "the present approach allows us to analyze the distributions of star forming regions in a halo , and also the clustering properties of halos .",
    "there are basically two types of subhalo accretion .",
    "one is the almost contemporaneous accretion of subhaloes in a young small parent halo , and then coeval starbursts take place in the halo .",
    "the other is the delayed accretion onto an evolved massive halo , and then a newly - triggered starburst and an old stellar population coexist .",
    "both types have the potentiality of becoming laes .",
    "if they satisfy lae conditions ( see the detail below ) , we call the former type 1 laes and the latter type 2 laes",
    ". a schematic view of type 1 and type 2 laes is shown in fig .",
    "[ laes_type ] .",
    "we perform a cosmological @xmath27-body simulation with the particle - particle - particle - mesh ( @xmath31 ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "the numerical scheme is based on @xcite .",
    "the size of comoving simulation box ( @xmath32 ) is set to be the same as the size of lae survey at @xmath8 by @xcite , that is , @xmath33 in linear scale .",
    "this allows us to adjust lae conditions by directly comparing with the observation . here",
    ", the periodic boundary condition is imposed .",
    "we use the plummer softening function for gravitational force , with the softening length of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 in a comoving scale ) .",
    "a parent halo is found using a friends - of - friends algorithm @xcite with linking length equal to 0.2 of the mean particle separation . in this study , a system with @xmath36 ( say , equal to or more than 100 particles ) is identified as a parent halo so that the system mass would be corresponding to observed laes . as previously mentioned , each particle ( subhalo ) in a parent halo has individual age .",
    "it is assumed that the star formation is triggered , when a subhalo accretes onto a parent halo .",
    "the star formation occurs only in the subhalo , and therefore no star formation is triggered at the central of host halo .",
    "also , a subhalo which underwent the star formation once does not trigger the star formation again . here , the star formation in each subhalo is assumed to occur at the rate as @xmath37 the star formation timescale @xmath38 is set to match the typical lifetime of young laes predicted by @xcite and @xcite , that is , @xmath39 .",
    "the efficiency @xmath40 is determined so that the final fraction of stellar mass to total baryonic mass is 10 percent . here , the salpeter initial mass function is assumed . in the present model , each particle",
    "is supposed to consist of dark matter and baryons .",
    "as far as the model laes concerned , newly accreted subhalos are predominantly responsible for lyman alpha emission , and those subhalos emits the bulk of uv photons before their dynamical relaxation .",
    "nonetheless , two - component ( dark matter and baryon ) simulations are very worth investigating in the future work .",
    "we identify laes under the same conditions as @xcite , that is , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are observed ly@xmath10 luminosity and ly@xmath10 equivalent width at rest - frame , respectively .",
    "we estimate observed ly@xmath10 luminosity by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is intrinsic ly@xmath10 luminosity , and @xmath47 is the escape fraction of ly@xmath10 photons .",
    "we calculate @xmath46 using `` pegase '' @xcite .",
    "the escape fraction is evaluated in terms of dust extinction as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the line - of - sight optical depth of dust with opacity in proportion to local metallicity . in practice , @xmath49 is dependent on grain size distributions , which are not well known in high-@xmath50 objects .",
    "hence , we normalize the net cross section of dust grains so that the number of simulated laes should match the observed number of laes at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "( in the present analysis , dust is treated as a pure absorber of ly@xmath10 photons , and the scattering of ly@xmath10 photons is not solved .",
    "the treatment of dust extinction can be more sophisticated in the future analysis . )",
    "in fig . [ age ] , the distributions of mass - weighted age are shown for simulated laes . the ages spread widely from @xmath1yr to @xmath2yr .",
    "interestingly , a significant number of laes are much older than @xmath51yr that is the lifetime of young laes predicted by @xcite and @xcite . as seen in fig .",
    "[ age ] , the distributions are fairly continuous from younger laes to older ones .",
    "younger laes are early coeval starburst galaxies , while older laes result from delayed starbursts triggered by later subhalo accretion onto evolved halos . in order to discriminate delayed starbursts from coeval young starbursts",
    ", we plot the young half - mass ages against the mass - weighted mean ages in fig .",
    "[ def ] , where , the young half - mass age is defined as the mass - weighted age of the young half subhalos included in a host halo . if starbursts are coeval in a halo , young half - mass ages should be comparable to mean ages .",
    "it is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ def ] that in the part older than @xmath52yr , coeval starbursts disappear and only delayed starbursts appear to be taking place .",
    "hence , in this paper , we define laes younger than @xmath3yr as type 1 laes , and older ones as type 2 laes .",
    "it is noted that there is not a clear boundary of two classes at @xmath3yr , but the transition is actually gradual in the sense that coeval and delayed starbursts are blended around @xmath51yr .",
    "nevertheless , as shown below , we find distinctive trends in photometric properties between type 1s and type 2s defined here",
    "[ properties ] shows equivalent width of ly@xmath10 emission , ly@xmath10 luminosity , star formation rate , and stellar mass against the mass - weighted age for simulated laes .",
    "equivalent width ( ew ) decreases with ages for type 1 laes , ranging from 40 to 200 , although some are at a level of 350 - 400 .",
    "ew for type 2s is randomly distributed in the range of 30-150 .",
    "ly@xmath10 luminosity is basically in proportion to star formation rate for type 1 laes , and gradually decreases with ages . for type 2 laes ,",
    "ly@xmath10 luminosity randomly spread in the range of @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "interestingly , in old type 2 laes ( @xmath55yr ) , a high star formation rate does not always lead to high ly@xmath10 luminosity .",
    "this can be understood by the effect of dust extinction as argued below .",
    "the stellar mass @xmath56 of laes is a fairly monotonic function of age .",
    "type 1 laes are less massive with @xmath4 , while type 2s are as massive as @xmath5 .",
    "recent observations show that laes detected by rest - frame optical / nir bands are more massive than @xmath57 and pretty older @xcite .",
    "such objects may correspond to type 2 laes .",
    "the fraction of type 2 laes in all laes is predicted to be a function of redshift .",
    "[ frac ] represents the type 2 lae fraction against redshift . obviously , the type 2 fraction increases with decreasing redshift .",
    "at @xmath6 , the type 2 fraction is less than 2 percent , since massive haloes have not grown yet , whereas it is @xmath730 percent at redshift @xmath8 and @xmath770 percent at @xmath9 .",
    "this trend is concordant with the recent observations by @xcite .      in fig . [",
    "sed ] , we show spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of a typical type 1 and type 2 lae , which are calculated by `` pegase '' @xcite .",
    "a type 1 lae is composed of young stars , while the host galaxy of a type 2 lae is dominated by evolved stars , where a distinct 4000  break is seen .",
    "accordingly , the colors of two types of laes are different .    in fig .",
    "[ twocolor ] , two color diagrams are shown in observed frames for @xmath9 laes and @xmath8 laes . the upper two panels are z-h vs j - k , while the lower two panels are z-k vs j - k , where z-band is @xmath589000 , j - band @xmath5812000 , h - band @xmath5817000 , and k - band @xmath5822000 .",
    "a red line in each panel indicates the evolutionary track of stars born in a single starburst .",
    "therefore , laes near this line represent almost coeval starbursts .",
    "the mass - weighted ages are shown by colors .",
    "as expected , type 1 laes ( @xmath59yr ) well follow the single starburst track , whereas colors of type 2s are a function of redshift . at lower redshifts , type 2s deviate farther from the single starburst track .",

    "moreover , type 2 lae is composed of some clumps .",
    "such clumpy structures can be seen some observed labs in the ssa22 region @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that some type 2 laes may not be well dynamically relaxed after mergers , since the duration of strong ly@xmath10 emission is shorter than the relaxation time of such a large system .",
    "since ly@xmath10 emission is radiated mostly by starbursts , ly@xmath10 bright regions correspond to sites of subhalo accretion .",
    "these results suggest that if we observe laes in various wavelengths , the extent and morphology of type 2 laes appear to be different in each band .",
    "recently , such an offset has been reported in local starburst galaxy @xcite , while no offset is found in laes at a higher redshift of @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "this can be related to the result that the number of more extended , older type 2 laes increases at lower redshifts , as shown below .",
    "ly@xmath10 emissions are affected more severely by dust extinction than continuum radiation .",
    "the effect of dust extinction is expected to be stronger for old metal - enriched systems . in fig .",
    "[ escape ] , the escape fractions of ly@xmath10 photons are plotted against ages of laes .",
    "the escape fractions are a decreasing function of lae ages as anticipated . in particular , in type 2 laes , the escape fractions decrease down to @xmath58 10 percent .",
    "thus , for aged type 2 laes , ly@xmath10 equivalent widths or luminosities become smaller than expected purely from star formation rate ( see fig .",
    "[ properties ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , in the outskirts of halo , starbursts by delayed subhalo accretion take place frequently , where the dust extinction is relatively small .",

    "this implies that type 1 laes preferentially reside lower - density regions at @xmath8 , as shown by @xcite , while type 2 laes are located in higher - density regions .",
    "the correlation strength of type 2 laes is comparable to that of lbgs in ssa22 region @xcite .",

    "type 2 laes are expected to be discriminated clearly from type 1 laes in two color diagram of z-h vs j - k .",
    "we find that the brightness distribution of ly@xmath10 in type 2 laes is more extended than the main stellar component , in contrast to type 1 laes .",
    "this is not only because delayed starbursts tend to occur in the outskirts of a parent galaxy , but also because ly@xmath10 photons are effectively absorbed by dust in an evolved galaxy .",

    "small type 2 laes are as compact as type 1 laes , while large type 2 laes exceeding @xmath63 are comparable to ly@xmath10 blobs ( labs ) @xcite .    moreover , we have found that the clustering of type 2 laes are even stronger than type 1 laes .",
    "the amplitude of angular correlation function of type 2 laes is comparable to that of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) @xcite .",
    "this suggests that lbgs with strong ly@xmath10 line can be type 2 laes .",

    "if many type 2 laes can be detected as smgs , this result is consistent with recent observation by @xcite .",

    "these properties are quite similar to those of type 2 laes we defined in this paper .",
    "hence , local laes could be a good sample to study the detailed physical states of type 2 laes .",

    "<S> in the last decade , numerous lyman - alpha emitters ( laes ) have been discovered with narrow - band filters at various redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> recently , multi - wavelength observations of laes have been performed and revealed that while many laes appear to be young and less massive , a noticeable fraction of laes possess much older populations of stars and larger stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> how these two classes of laes are concordant with the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario has not been understood clearly so far . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we model laes by three - dimensional cosmological simulations of dark halo merger in a @xmath0cdm universe . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that the age of simulated laes can spread over a wide range from @xmath1yr to @xmath2yr . also , we find that there are two types of laes , in one of which the young half - mass age is comparable to the mean age of stellar component , and in the other of which the young half - mass age is appreciably shorter than the mean age . </S>",
    "<S> we define the former as type 1 laes and the latter as type 2 laes . </S>",
    "<S> a type 1 lae corresponds to early starburst in a young galaxy , whereas a type 2 lae does to delayed starburst in an evolved galaxy , as a consequence of delayed accretion of a subhalo onto a larger parent halo . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the same halo can experience a type 2 lae - phase as well as a type 1 lae - phase in the merger history . </S>",
    "<S> type 1 laes are expected to be younger than @xmath3yr , less dusty , and less massive with stellar mass @xmath4 , while type 2 laes are older than @xmath3yr , even dustier , and as massive as @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of type 2s in all laes is a function of redshift , which is less than 2 percent at @xmath6 , @xmath730 percent at redshift @xmath8 , and @xmath770 percent at @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> type 2 laes can be discriminated clearly from type 1s in two color diagram of z-h vs j - k . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the brightness distribution of ly@xmath10 in type 2 laes is more extended than the main stellar component , in contrast to type 1 laes . </S>",
    "<S> this is not only because delayed starbursts tend to occur in the outskirts of a parent galaxy , but also because ly@xmath10 photons are effectively absorbed by dust in an evolved galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the extent of ly@xmath10 emission may be an additional measure to distinguish type 2 laes from type 1 laes . </S>",
    "<S> the sizes of type 2 laes range from a few tens to a few hundreds kpc . at lower redshifts , </S>",
    "<S> the number of more extended , older type 2 laes increases . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is anticipated that the amplitude of angular correlation function for type 2 laes is significantly higher than that for type 1 laes , but comparable to that for lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that lbgs with strong ly@xmath10 line may include type 2 laes .    </S>",
