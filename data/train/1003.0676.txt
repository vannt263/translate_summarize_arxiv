    "in the currently favoured @xmath0cdm cosmological model , the bulk of the matter component is believed to be made of ( so far ) electromagnetically undetected particles , commonly dubbed dark matter ( dm ) . although the evidence for the existence of dm is compelling on different scales , yet its nature is unknown , and many particle models beyond the standard one have been proposed in the literature as dm candidates .",
    "we address the reader to a recent review of observational evidence and particle candidates for dm ( e.g. bertone , hooper & silk 2005 ) , and will concentrate in this paper on a particular class of candidates , i.e. weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "many wimp dm models are stable ( under the conservation of the suitable symmetry , for each model ) and hence do never decay into standard model particles .",
    "however , in many of these very same models the wimps are majorana particles , thus carrying the remarkable property of being self - annihilating ; the value of the self  annihilation cross section , arising naturally in many wimp models , reproduces the dark matter relic abundance required by the @xmath0cdm cosmology , if the mass scale of wimps is within the gev / tev scale and they are to be thermally produced in the early universe .",
    "we adopt this as a benchmark scenario for our paper , and will often refer to it as a `` vanilla wimp '' .",
    "the actual dm distribution in the local universe is such that even in the densest regions ( e.g. galactic nuclei and black hole surroundings ) from which the annihilation signal could be in principle detected , the energy released by wimp dm annihilations ( hereafter , dmas ) is only a negligible fraction of the one associated with standard gas processes .",
    "this implies that , locally , dm affects the host system almost uniquely through its gravitational effects , perhaps with the only possible exception of peculiar locations , such as the central parsec of the milky way ( fairbairn , scott & edsjo 2008 , scott , edsjo & fairbairn 2009 , casanellas & lopes 2009 ) .",
    "the effects of annihilating ( or decaying , a scenario we do not consider here ) dm upon the evolution of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) at high redshift have been thoroughly studied ( e.g. chen & kamionkowski 2004 ; padmanabhan & finkbeiner 2005 ; mapelli & ferrara 2005 ; mapelli , ferrara & pierpaoli 2006 ; furlanetto , oh & pierpaoli 2006 ; zhang et al .",
    "2006 ; ripamonti , mapelli & ferrara 2007a ; valds et al .",
    "2007 ; shchekinov & vasiliev 2007 ) , and are now believed to be small , except perhaps in the case of an extremely high clumping factor ( myers & nusser 2008 ; chuzhoy 2008 ; natarajan & schwarz 2008 , lattanzi & silk 2009 ) , if one takes into consideration a standard , vanilla wimp scenario .",
    "the effects of dmas upon primordial star - formation might be more significant .",
    "as the igm could be heated by the energy deposition from dmas , its temperature might in principle exceed the virial temperature of the smallest halos with the result of quenching gas accretion onto them .",
    "this effect has been shown to be unimportant by ripamonti , mapelli & ferrara ( 2007b , hereafter rmf07 ) .",
    "however , dmas are expected to become more important as the collapse proceeds to protostellar scales ( ascasibar 2007 ) .",
    "spolyar , freese & gondolo ( 2008 ; hereafter sfg08 ) found that during the protostellar collapse of the first ( pop iii ) stars , the energy released by dmas and absorbed by the gas could compensate ( or even overcome ) the radiative cooling of the gas .",
    "the increasing importance of such process arises from the combined enhancement during the collapse of dm density ( due to gravitational dragging ) and gas optical depth , implying a higher annihilation luminosity and absorption by the gas .",
    "the final phases of the collapse , after the formation of a hydrostatic core for gas central densities @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the central baryonic density , and @xmath3 is the proton mass ) , have been investigated by iocco et al .",
    "( 2008 , hereafter i08 ) , freese et al .",
    "( 2008b , 2009 ) and spolyar et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . initially ,",
    "the dm pile - up is purely driven by gravitational interactions , but as the protostar approaches the zero age main sequence , dm accretion becomes dominated by the capture of wimps located in the star host halo after they scatter stellar baryons .",
    "as a consequence of the peculiar formation process of pop iii , following the smooth collapse of the gas cloud at the very center of the dm halos hosting them , iocco ( 2008 ) and freese , spolyar & aguirre ( 2008 ) suggested that dm capture is relevant for primordial stars ; however , it can be safely neglected once local star formation is concerned , as the latter takes place anywhere in galactic discs , and it does nt follow from a single , centered gas collapse episode . further studies ( i08 , yoon , iocco & akiyama 2008 ; taoso et al .",
    "2008 ) have concluded that wimp dm capture s most remarkable effect is the possible increase of the stellar lifetime .",
    "quite surprisingly , the early phases of the collapse have received so far less attention with respect to the more advanced ones , i.e. after hydrostatic core formation .",
    "for example , it is still unclear if the energy injection following annihilations results in a nett heating or cooling of the gas .",
    "in fact , high energy photons and electrons heat the gas through ionizations ; however , this heat input could be overwhelmed by the increased production of cooling species ( as for example molecular hydrogen ) stimulated by the larger abundances of free electrons , thus resulting in a net gas cooling .",
    "this , among others , is one of the aspects of the collapse of first stars in presence of wimp annihilation that we would like to address here .",
    "we plan to do so by a set of sophisticated numerical simulations including all the relevant chemical reactions and cooling processes .",
    "a first attempt to model the effects of dma energy input was presented in ripamonti et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ; this paper represents a substantial extension and improvement of that study .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume the following set of cosmological parameters : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "we base our investigation on a 1-d spherically symmetric code described by ripamonti et al .",
    "( 2002 ; hereafter r02 ) . the original code , which includes the treatment of gravitation , hydrodynamics , and especially the chemistry and cooling of primordial gas , was originally conceived for the study of the last phases of the collapse of a primordial protostar ( see also omukai & nishi 1998 ) ; later",
    ", it was extended in several ways ( see ripamonti 2007 , ripamonti et al .",
    "2007a , and rmf07 ) .",
    "our simulations are based on those described in rmf07 ; here we list their most important properties , especially when they differ from rmf07 :    a single typical halo with mass @xmath9 virializing at @xmath10 ( virial radius @xmath11 ) is considered ; the baryon fraction inside such halo is assumed to be equal to the cosmological value ( @xmath12 ) ;    the simulations are started at @xmath13 and involve a comoving volume 1000 times larger than that of simulated halo ; initial baryonic density and temperature are constant in all the simulation shells , and equal to the cosmological values ;    before virialization , the gravitational effects of dm are treated as in the nfw case of rmf07 : a predetermined ( but time - dependent until virialization ) dm potential is added to the gas self gravity .",
    "such potential mimics the evolution of a halo in the top - hat approximation : as the dm potential becomes steeper , the ( initially uniform ) gas falls towards the centre of the halo , similarly to what is predicted by theory and consistent with the results of simulations ( see e.g. fig .  2 of abel et al .",
    "2002 ) ;    after virialization , the evolution of the previously described artificial dm potential is stopped : its state at virialization is set to a nfw profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) with @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; this is reasonably close to the results shown in fig . 2 of abel et al .",
    "the evolution of the dm profile is also followed in response to the baryon contraction ( see later ) in order to compute the dma rate ;    rmf07 investigated _ whether _ stellar formation might occur in a halo , whereas here we investigate _ how _ it starts ; for this reason , simulations are stopped only when their computational costs become very large ( usually at number densities @xmath16 ) ;    the dm energy input is computed only after halo virialization , and only in regions with high baryon density ( @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 ) , rather than at all times and everywhere : this is because rmf07 already showed that before virialization and at low baryon densities the effects of dmas are small ;    for the purpose of evaluating the dma rate ( see below ) , the dm density @xmath19 is evaluated by assuming the conservation of the so called `` adiabatic '' invariant ( see blumenthal et al .",
    "we implement the algorithm described by gnedin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , following the details in i08 , and using the nfw and gas profiles described above as initial conditions ;    the specific luminosity due to dmas is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the thermally - averaged annihilation rate , and @xmath22 is the wimp mass ; in the following we adopt @xmath23 , whereas we consider @xmath22 as a free parameter in the range @xmath24 ( i.e. @xmath25 ) ;    the energy @xmath26 that each baryon actually absorbs from dm annihilations ( per unit time ) is calculated through a detailed radiative transfer calculation , formally identical to the one performed for gray continuum radiation .",
    "such calculation is based on a constant gas opacity @xmath27 ( roughly similar to the values used by sfg08 ) . moreover , since it is believed that the energy from annihilations splits roughly equally into electrons , photons , and neutrinos , we assume that only @xmath28 of @xmath29 ( i.e. the fraction not going into neutrinos ) can be absorbed ;    similar to rmf07 , @xmath26 can go into ionization , heating and excitation of atoms and molecules ; we employ the results of valds & ferrara ( 2008 ) ( see also shull & van steenberg 1985 , and furlanetto & johnson stoever 2010 ) to estimate how to split the energy input into these three . also note that the `` ionization '' component is split into ionization of h , d , he , he@xmath30 , and dissociation of , hd and h@xmath31 . in our `` standard '' treatment each species receives a fraction of the ionization energy which is proportional to its total baryonic content ( in number , see rmf07 for details ) ;    r02 switched to equilibrium chemistry ( e.g. allowing the use of saha equations instead of the detailed balance ones ) for shells with number densities @xmath32 . here",
    "we drop this simplification since ( i ) dmas effects change the chemical evolution of the gas , and usually delay the approach to equilibrium , and ( ii ) we never venture to densities @xmath33 .",
    "given the standing ignorance on the precise detail of feedback effects on the ionization and dissociation of atoms and molecules ( especially h@xmath34 ) , in addition to the standard , fiducial set of runs we performed runs with either enhanced or reduced feedback , in order to bracket the possible impact of such process .",
    "in the same way , since the opacity @xmath35 we employ represents only a very rough estimate , we performed runs with either higher or lower values of @xmath35 .",

    "we will discuss the dependence on these two latter parameters in section [ sec : opacfeed ] .",
    "here we start by introducing in more details the physics of first star formation in presence of dmas for our fiducial models ( `` m '' labeled runs , see table [ tab : runlist ] for details ) .",
    "it is worth anticipating that the effects of dm become more relevant ( and they become efficient earlier during the collapse ) for higher self - annihilation cross sections / lower dm masses ( see eq .",

    "the thin solid ( blue ) corresponds to the fiducial model ( run m100 ) ; the dashed ( red ) to the maximal model ( m1 ) ; the dot - dashed ( green ) to the sub - maximal model ( m10 ) ; and the thin dotted ( magenta ) to the minimal model ( m1000).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    figure  [ fig : plot_n_t ] shows the evolution of the temperature @xmath45 of the innermost shell as a function of the density of the same central shell of the simulated objects ( @xmath44 ) , for the five most representative models , m100 , m10 , m1 , m1000 , and nodm ( see table  [ tab : runlist ] ) .",
    "as expected , dma effects , which can be quantified by the deviations from the thick solid line , are most prominent in runs with low mass particles @xmath46 ( m1 run , corresponding to the maximal dma energy injection rate ) , and become very limited in the case of dm particles with high mass @xmath47 ( m1000 run , minimal dma energy injection rate ) ; we will comment extensively on such dependence later in this section . in the following",
    "we will refer to the `` fiducial '' run ( m100 ; where the choice of parameters is quite standard ) , to the `` minimal '' run ( m1000 ; where the high value of @xmath22 reduces the energy injection from dmas , providing a check on the level where its effects become negligible ) , to the `` maximal '' run ( m1 ; where the parameters are chosen in a way which maximizes the energy injection from dmas and their effects upon the gas evolution ) , and to the `` sub - maximal '' run , m10 .",
    "the maximal model , m1 , is likely to represent a sort of upper limit on the effects of dmas on the formation of primordial stars .",
    "in fact , the dm parameters corresponding to this run ( @xmath21=3@xmath3910@xmath48 , @xmath36=1 gev ) are currently severely disfavored by multimessenger constraints on dm , in particular by ( astrophysical ) parameter - independent ones ( e.g. galli et al .",
    "2009 ; cirelli , iocco and panci 2009 ) .",
    "of what is shown here , since the total dma energy input also includes energy actually going into excitations and ionizations ( see text for details).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    figure  [ fig : plot_n_lambdah2_dminput ] compares the total energy input from dmas into the gas ( which needs to be splitted into ionizations , heating and excitations ) to the cooling rate due to .",
    "this comparison largely oversimplifies the thermal balance ( see next subsection ) ; however , it makes clear that , even in the maximal case , the heating from dmas remains a relatively small fraction of the cooling until @xmath44 becomes @xmath49 . at earlier stages ( i.e. lower densities ) the effects of dmas are more subtle than what could be simply inferred by the direct heating , which would not be able to significantly change the temperature of the gas .",
    "in fact , it is quite remarkable that in the @xmath50 range , the _ additional _ energy injection from dmas results in a _ decrease _ of the central temperature ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : plot_n_t ] ) .",

    "in fact , as it can be inferred from fig .  [",
    "fig : plot_n_f ] , dma _ ionization _ effects keep the gas more ionized than in the nodm case ( i.e. @xmath52 abundance @xmath53@xmath54 , rather than @xmath55 ) . in turn , this relatively high ionization level favors the formation of through the reaction chain @xmath56 which is the main formation route for in moderately dense , dust - free gas , and where the electrons act as catalysts ( see e.g. galli & palla 1998 ; glover & jappsen 2007 ; stasielak , biermann & kusenko 2007 ) .",

    "( 2009 ) remarked , the increase in the fraction can amount to 2 - 3 orders of magnitude , which apparently might imply same order - of - magnitude differences in the cooling rate , and large differences also in the gas temperature .",
    "however , while the increase in the cooling rate is quite large ( though smaller than what is naively expected from the difference in abundance ) , the corresponding reduction of the gas temperature is much smaller , of the order of 30 per cent ( see fig.[fig : plot_n_t ] ) .",
    "this is due to the very strong temperature dependence of cooling , especially below @xmath57 ( the temperature corresponding to the transition from the fundamental state to the lowest rotationally excited level ) : in fact , in this regime a moderate reduction in temperature results in a much larger decrease in the cooling rate , which in turn slows down the temperature decrease .    , whereas the bottom panel compares the various models by showing the ratio of @xmath58 in a given model to @xmath59 in the nodm run.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    as a result , since the jeans mass sensitivity to the temperature is quite mild , @xmath60 dmas might reduce the jeans mass scale but only by a factor @xmath61 ( see fig .

    "run , chemical heating dominates over the adiabatic heating in the @xmath88 density range , which coincides with the regime where 3-body reactions ( see palla , salpeter & stahler 1983 ) turn most of the hydrogen into molecular form . in the runs with dmas such",
    "a phase is even more extended , as the dma feedback on the chemistry anticipates the epoch of rapid formation : in the maximal run , chemical heating becomes dominant already at @xmath89 .",
    "it is remarkable that the chemical term can contribute both to heating and to cooling .",
    "it was already known ( see e.g. omukai & nishi 1998 ; r02 ) that because of this property , it tends to act as a `` thermostat '' which stabilizes the evolution of the collapse , even if it can not always prevent sudden transitions .",
    "the evolution of the maximal and sub - maximal models are particularly significant in this respect . in these models the fraction peaks ( at a level @xmath90 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : plot_n_f ] ) when @xmath91@xmath92 : in such conditions 3-body formation is slowed down by the relative scarcity of atomic h left , and must compete with the increasingly large number of dissociations due to the ionization component of the dma energy input .",
    "when the molecular fraction starts to go down , the cooling rate must follow , because it is dominated by and the number of molecules is being reduced ; but so does the heating , because its dominant component ( chemical heating ) is reduced by the energy lost in molecular dissociations . the fact that both the heating and the cooling mechanisms follow the same trend prevents a significant steepening of the temperature evolution and the consequent stop in the protostellar collapse .",
    "this is because the `` excess '' energy which is not radiated away is mainly used to dissociate .",
    "however , this can not last indefinitely , as the reservoir of is finite , and the dma energy injection increases with increasing density . in the case of the maximal run , where the dma energy injection is quite high ,",
    "is rapidly exhausted . at @xmath93",
    "there is essentially no left , which also implies almost no radiative cooling .",
    "then , the temperature goes up very fast ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : plot_n_t ] ) , developing a pressure gradient which is able to momentarily stop the collapse of the innermost shell ( actually , there is even a very brief re - expansion episode- more details are discussed in section [ sec : evolspatprof ] ) ; however , the increase in temperature also results in a very strong increase in the continuum radiation which is produced by collision - induced emission , h@xmath94 , and atomic h : continuum radiation increases by some 6 orders of magnitude ( cfr .",
    "lenzuni , chernoff & salpeter 1991 ; marigo & aringer 2009 ) and replaces line radiation as the main cooling mechanism for the gas .",
    "the collapse is then able to resume , even if further investigations are needed in order to understand its details beyond @xmath95 . at present in fact , computational costs become almost unaffordable beyond @xmath96 because of the strong sensitivity of cooling rate on temperature . in spite of these limitations we consider the conclusions based on these runs very robust as we have pushed the evolution to densities exceeding @xmath97 times the  critical \" density at which the cooling becomes comparable to the dma energy transferred to baryons .",
    "things are quite different in the case of the sub - maximal run : here a moderate dissociation rate can compensate both the heating and the ionization parts of the ( relatively small ) dma energy input for a significant span .",
    "in fact , at @xmath98 ( i.e. at a density @xmath99 times larger than the density at the onset of dissociation , and @xmath73 times larger than the density at the `` critical point '' ) the fraction is still @xmath100 : it is still possible that exhaustion ( which we expect to happen at @xmath101 ) is accompanied by a transition similar to the one we discussed for the maximal case ; however , such transition is likely to involve a smaller adjustment in temperature ( say , an increase by a factor @xmath102 rather than @xmath84 ) because the required increase in the continuum cooling is much smaller ( somewhat less than 3 orders of magnitude rather than 6 , as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : plot_n_heatcool ] ) than what was required in the maximal case .",
    "the fiducial and minimal runs exhibit trends which are somewhat similar to the sub - maximal run : the peak in the abundance at @xmath103 is followed by an extremely slow decline , during which the adiabatic heating is often as important as the dma heating : then , it is quite likely that the transition from line cooling to continuum cooling is as smooth as in the scenario without dmas .",
    "in fact , it should be noted that at @xmath98 the continuum cooling amounts already to about 10 per cent of the total heating , and it is increasing faster than any heating mechanism ( see fig .  [ fig : plot_n_heatcool ] ) .       for run coding.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in order to check the effect of our assumptions about feedback ( in particular , destruction of molecules by the energy injected by dmas into the gas ) we have run two extra sets of simulations : the first ( label : e ) in which feedback is enhanced , and the second ( label : n ) with dm - induced dissociations switched off . in the e - models , we have assumed that _ all _ dma energy input which goes into excitations is in the form of photons in the lyman - werner band ( @xmath104 ) , and that each of these photons dissociates one molecule , where @xmath105 is the baryon number density , @xmath26 is the energy input per baryon due to dmas , @xmath106 is the fraction of this energy which goes into excitations ( i.e. into photons with @xmath107 ) , and @xmath108 is the average energy of a lyman - werner photon .",

    "this clearly represents an upper limit on the feedback upon , as in reality about half of the photons going into dissociations has energy below the lower limit of the lyman - werner band ; furthermore , in low density regions a significant fraction of lyman - werner photons can escape .    as it can easily be noticed from the upper panel of figure [ fig : plot_t_fbk_kappa ] , ( showing the evolution of models m1 , e1 and l1 in the @xmath82 plane )",
    "switching off the feedback results in a sensible change of the temperature only in the final stages of collapse ( because the absence of dma - induced dissociations strongly reduces the heating ) ; on the other hand , strengthening the feedback results in appreciable modification of the temperature of the cloud in earlier stages ( because it reduces the abundance ) , but the difference reduces drastically in later phases ( when the direct effects of dmas dominate the ones on chemistry ) .",

    "[ fig : plot_t_fbk_kappa ] ( with @xmath46 ) .",
    "we have also studied the effects of varying the gray opacity @xmath35 , by running sets of simulations in which we have increased / decreased the fiducial value @xmath35=0.01@xmath110 by one order of magnitude . at low and intermediate densities",
    "the effects on the evolution of the cloud are very similar to those of a decrease / increase of the particle mass @xmath22 ; whereas models with the same @xmath22 tend to converge at high densities .",
    "in fact , an opacity variation affects sensibly the properties of the gas only when it is of `` optically thin '' to the energy produced by dmas : in later stages of the collapse , ( i.e. in regions of the halo where the gas is `` optically thick '' to the dma energy ) , the energy absorption does not depend on @xmath35 .",

    "the top - left panel shows also the dm density in the case of m100 run at the same stages ( dm density stays constant and equal to the initial profile in the nodm control run ) .",
    "the first important remark to file is that the gas density profiles are virtually unchanged by the presence of dmas : such profiles are indistinguishable until central gas densities of @xmath12610@xmath127 are reached , and even then the discrepancies are of minor entity ( e.g. , the slope outside the core becomes @xmath128 rather than @xmath129 ) .",
    "we can conclude that dmas do not alter the self - similar phase of the collapse ( larson 1969 , penston 1969 ) , at least for run m100 and for @xmath130 .",
    "the evolution of the dm density profile is in good agreement with previous studies , see for instance fig . 1 in sfg08 , and fig . 1 in i08 .",
    "it is also relevant to notice that ( as could be expected ) the differences in infall velocity , temperature profile and fraction affect only the central @xmath131 of gas ( i.e. the gas within the hexagonal marks ) . actually , relevant",
    "( although yet not dramatic ) differences are limited to the inner @xmath132 ( region within the pentagonal marks ) : the overall properties of the @xmath9 halo are conserved in presence of dmas .",
    "the lower panels visualize the changes in temperature ( lower left ) following the modification of fraction ( lower right ) which we have extensively commented in the previous sections . here",
    "we only note that the molecular core is significantly more extended than in the control run : the region where is the dominant chemical species encloses @xmath133 , rather than @xmath134 ; furthermore , the fall in abundance is less steep than in the case without dmas .",
    "the upper right panel is somewhat intriguing , as it gives a glimpse of the modification of the dynamical properties of the collapse : while there are very little changes in the central region ( say , within the square marks , corresponding to a @xmath135 enclosed mass ) and in the outskirts of the halo ( at enclosed masses @xmath136 , i.e. outside a point roughly mid - way between the pentagonal and hexagonal marks ) , the infall velocity of the intermediate - mass gas shells is slowed down .",
    "the reduced temperature of the cloud ( due to the more efficient cooling which we discussed in the previous sections ; see also the bottom - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : profilo_r ] ) is likely responsible for this change . in fact , it is well known ( see e.g. stahler , palla & salpeter 1986 , and references therein ) that during the self - similar evolution , the mass infall rate @xmath137 in the region where the density falls as a power law with index @xmath84 should roughly scale with @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the isothermal sound speed . since @xmath140 is practically the same in the m100 and the nodm run , the reduced temperature should result in a reduced infall velocity , similar to what we obtain .",
    "it is worth noting that on the contrary , the collapse of the innermost gas shell is _ accelerated _ , albeit very slightly , by the presence of dm , until central densities of 10@xmath141(/10@xmath142 ) for the m100(/m1 ) case , see table [ tab : collapsetime ] .",

    "the top - left panel shows that even in this case dmas do not alter the self - similar part of the collapse ; however , it should be remarked that the highest density stage is starting to deviate from the expected self - similar profile : in fact , the density profile within the core is not flat , but there is a maximum at the edge of the core .",
    "this is more clear when we examine the other panels : the lines referring to the three stages with @xmath148 are qualitatively similar to their counterparts in fig .",
    "[ fig : profilo_r ] ; but the lines representing the highest density stage are clearly different , and we will focus on them .    in the lower panels we can see a huge drop in the abundance near the centre of the protostar , and a corresponding discontinuity in the gas temperature ; both could be expected by our discussion in the previous sections , even if here we get a further piece of information about the size of the region where the was dissociated ( @xmath149 , enclosed mass @xmath150 ) .",
    "also the velocity panel is affected : this is the only case where the infall velocities of the run with dmas significantly exceed those in the control run in an extended region ; furthermore , we can see that there are secondary peaks in velocity at low radii ( in particular one is coincident with the edge of the region where was dissociated ) , which are likely to result from the propagation of the density wave which was generated by the re - expansion of the core which occurred when @xmath93 .",
    "all these properties indicate that the core of this object is approaching hydrostatical equilibrium , even if it is not quite there .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the innermost regions , of enclosed mass between 1m@xmath117 and 10m@xmath117 , are infalling with higher velocity than in the nodm case , whereas between 10m@xmath117 and 10@xmath145m@xmath117 the collapse is slowed , when central density is @xmath44=10@xmath151 .",
    "again , this is equivalent to what we have observed for the fiducial run , and shown in table [ tab : collapsetime ] , and the feature only becomes more pronounced in the case of the maximal run .",
    "we have studied the effects of self - annihilating dark matter on the collapse of the gas structures harboring the formation of the first stars , known as pop iii . for the first time in the literature",
    "we follow self - consistently the evolution of the dark matter profile as a consequence of the gravitational drag of the collapsing gas and include the feedback of energy injection by dm annihilations on the chemistry of the gas , in the yet unexplored regime between the virialization of the halo and the formation of a hydrostatic core .",
    "we have explored the effects of dmas by spanning a range of masses and annihilation cross sections around the values of the vanilla wimp scenario , namely those able to reproduce the relic abundance of dm with a thermal decoupling , finding similar results but with variations in the details and onset times of the different phases that we are to summarize .    in the following ,",
    "quoted numbers refer to our fiducial case ( @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 ) .",
    "as expected , heavier wimps ( or smaller self - annihilation rates , or lower opacity since the energy injection term is proportional to @xmath21/m@xmath155 and depends also on @xmath35 ) effects become relevant at later times during the collapse , the same dma rate being achieved at higher dm densities . lighter particles ( or higher @xmath21 , or higher @xmath35 ) produce the same effects at earlier times ( and therefore smaller gas densities ) .",
    "this general scenario is robust with respect to parameter variations within physically acceptable ranges .",
    "a few key points of our study are worth some emphasis : _",
    "( i ) _ as known from existing literature ( rmf07 ) , before the virialization of the halo , at gas density @xmath156 ( and therefore extremely small gas opacity ) dmas do not sensibly affect any gas process ; _ ( ii ) _ between halo virialization and a gas density @xmath157 dmas contribute mainly through indirect feedback effects : the free electron floor created by the ionizations induced by dmas catalyzes formation . in turn , molecular provides more cooling to the cloud than in the standard case ( without dmas ) and the temperature of the cloud _ decreases _ as a consequence of dmas ; _ ( iii ) _ finally , at @xmath158 the dma heating rate becomes equal to the gas cooling rate .",
    "to a first approximation this leads to a balance between losses and gain , which we dubbed as the `` critical point '' .",
    "our results generally agree with previous ones : as the semi - analytical estimates of sfg08 and the analytical study ( based on simulation data ) from natarajan , tan and  o shea ( 2009 ) , we confirm the existence of a `` critical point '' .",
    "we also find that the equality of cooling vs dma heating terms takes place ( in the innermost shell ) at central densities of approximately @xmath85 , details depending on parameters ( dm mass , opacity coefficient etc . see previous section , and following discussion ) , in agreement with the above mentioned studies .",
    "this is particularly relevant as our analysis is the first fully numerical , self - consistent study including a reasonably accurate treatment of radiative transfer allowing to reach the critical point and beyond it in at least three cases .",
    "it had been previously suggested ( sfg08 ) that , after reaching of the `` critical point '' , the collapse would stop and the whole structure stall , thus generating a new type of celestial object . with our numerical simulations",
    "we have accessed this stage of the collapse , finding that the system does _ not _ halt its collapse in three cases out of four ; in the only case where the collapse stops , this happens far after the critical point was reached , and its duration is very short ( @xmath159 ) after which the gas restarts contracting . moreover , the dm parameters for which the astrophysical system finds important changes after the critical point are actually strongly disfavored by dm constraints based on local and primordial universe observations . by changing the dm mass or self - annihilation rate ,",
    "the scenario we have described does not change qualitatively , within the range of values studied and the physical regime we have accessed with our simulations .    while stressing again that when our objects reach the critical point the structure does _ not _ halt the collapse , and instead it continues its evolution toward the formation of a protostellar core , it is also useful to comment on the alteration of the dynamics of the collapse induced by dmas .",
    "the duration of the gas collapse from halo virialization down to densities of @xmath160 , in presence of dmas appears to be _ shorter _ ( especially in the first phases ) than in the standard case ( by about 1 per cent ) of the total collapse time .",
    "however we point out that the change is a small fraction of the total , and that the effects of dmas on collapse time are very difficult to quantify .",
    "in fact , the dmas effect can indeed accelerate the collapse in some shells , and decelerate it in others , thus making it difficult to obtain a homogeneous definition of time delay .",
    "for example , the reduction of the infall velocity of shells enclosing @xmath132 implies that the collapse time of these shells is longer ( by 1020 per cent ) than in the control ( nodm ) case .",
    "we feel confident in stressing , however , that the shells which are mostly affected by the infall time decrease ( @xmath7020% of the infall velocity ) are placed between 10@xmath118m@xmath117 and 10@xmath145m@xmath117 , and would become part of a hydrostatic protostar only in the final stages of the collapse .",
    "it is not clear whether these shells will eventually end up in the hydrostatic core ( omukai & palla 2003 ) , however it is reasonable to expect that such modification will not alter the _ total _ time for the formation of the star by more than @xmath7020 per cent .",
    "even if our runs could not reach the regime when a hydrostatic core forms ( with the partial exception of the maximal run , where we probably got close ) , it is worth to examine the likely consequences of our results for the further evolution of the protostar in presence of dmas .",
    "we start reminding that in the standard case ( without dmas ) the simulations of r02 show that when the protostar becomes opaque to continuum radiation ( at @xmath161 ) , the formation of the hydrostatic core is delayed by the thermostatic effects of dissociations , so that the core actually forms when @xmath162 .",
    "however , at the end of our runs the central abundance in the maximal and sub - maximal runs is @xmath163 ; even in the fiducial run , the abundance , while still high , is decreasing much earlier than in the standard case ; this is very different from the results of r02 , where @xmath164 up to @xmath165 .",
    "because of the lower amount of h@xmath34 , it is reasonable to expect that in the cases with dmas the delaying effects of dissociation are absent , or smaller than in the standard case .",
    "then , the hydrostatic core would form at lower densities ( e.g. , @xmath166 , if the protostar becomes optically thick to continuum radiation at the same density as in the r02 runs ) , and its initial mass would be larger ( probably in the 0.010.1 @xmath167 range , rather than @xmath168 ) .",
    "however , we point out that r02 found that in the case with no dmas the mass of the hydrostatic core grows very fast , reaching @xmath169 in less than 3 years ( see e.g. their fig .",
    "6 ) : then , the difference in the initial size is relatively unimportant .",
    "it is probably more relevant to note that the lower temperatures and infall velocities of the layers outside the hydrostatic core imply that in the cases with dmas the accretion rate might be slower than what was found by r02 .",
    "we have studied the effects of wimp dark matter annihilations ( dmas ) on the evolution of primordial gas clouds hosting the first stars .",
    "we have followed the collapse of gas and dm within a @xmath170 halo virializing at redshift @xmath171 , from @xmath13 to slightly before the formation of a hydrostatic core , properly including gas heating / cooling and chemistry processes induced by dmas , and exploring the dependency of the results on different parameters ( dm particle mass , self - annihilation cross section , gas opacity , feedback strength ) . independently of such parameters , when the central baryon density , @xmath44 , is lower than the critical density , @xmath172 , corresponding to a model - dependent balance between dma energy input and gas cooling rate , dma ionizations catalyze an increase in the abundance by a factor @xmath99 .",
    "the increased cooling moderately reduces the temperature ( by @xmath173 per cent ) but does not significantly reduce the fragmentation mass scale . for @xmath174 ,",
    "the dma energy injection exceeds the cooling , with the excess heat mainly going into dissociations . in the presence of dma the transition to the continuum dominated cooling regime",
    "occurs earlier and generally is not associated with abrupt temperature variations . in conclusion ,",
    "no significant differences are found with respect to the case without dmas ; in particular , and contrary to previous claims , the collapse does not stall and the cloud keeps contracting even when @xmath175 .",
    "our simulations stop at central densities @xmath176 , and can not follow the hydrostatic core formation , nor its accretion . at the final simulation stage ,",
    "the lower temperature / infall velocity of the layers enclosing a mass of @xmath177 suggest that dmas might lead to slightly longer stellar formation timescales , with a possible @xmath178 per cent increase over models without dmas .",
    "the latter finding strengthens our conclusions , although the final answer will come from numerical simulations ( hopefully also three - dimensional ) able to address this very same problem in the yet unexplored density regime @xmath179 .",

    "the case of a `` fast collapse '' ( where the baryon collapse time is similar to the free - fall time ) was studied by steigman et al .",

    "iiib ) , in the assumptions that i ) the baryons stand still at @xmath180 ( so that they will collapse in free - fall ) , ii ) the dm contribution to the total mass @xmath181 is small , and iii ) dm particles have a dispersion velocity @xmath182 . the case can be treated analytically , and steigman et al .",
    "( 1978 ) obtain that if the radius of the sphere enclosing all the baryons goes from @xmath183 ( at time @xmath180 ) to @xmath184 ( at time @xmath185 ) , the ratio of the number @xmath186 of dm particles within @xmath184 ( at @xmath187 ) to the number @xmath188 of dm particles within @xmath183 ( at @xmath180 ) is roughly proportional to @xmath189 ( cfr .",
    "31 and  32 of steigman et al .",
    "1978 rather than @xmath190 , since this is the value that can be inferred from the more general eq . 31 . ] ) , at least in the limit of @xmath191 .",
    "then , the density @xmath192 of dm particles should grow asymptotically as @xmath193 , or as @xmath194 .",
    "we can compare this behaviour to the dependence of the central dm density ( @xmath195 ) upon the central baryonic density ( @xmath196 ) which can be obtained from the ac formalism : spg08 find that @xmath197 , and our calculations essentially confirm their result .",
    "then , it is clear that the `` fast collapse '' slope is significantly flatter than what can be inferred from the application ot the ac formalism .",
    "however , there are some extra facts that need to be kept into account .    * for central baryonic number densities @xmath198 the dm density is larger than the baryonic one , and the application of the ac does not modify the dm density profile ; * the `` fast collapse '' slope was obtained with the assumption of an uniform density profile of both the baryons and the dm , whereas the nfw profile of our initial dm profile is strongly peaked : then , the calculations of @xmath199 by steigman et al .",
    "( 1978 ) likely underestimate the value appropriate in our case ; as a consequence , it is likely that the slope of the @xmath200 relation is higher than 0.5 ; * the dm profile seen in the simulations of abel et al .",
    "2002 appears to be more consistent with the ac predictions than with those of the `` fast collapse '' model : in fact , the innermost dm density shown in their fig .",
    "2 is a factor @xmath201 lower than the baryonic density @xmath202 : this is somewhat consistent with the difference by a factor @xmath203^{1 - 0.81}\\sim 6 $ ] predicted by ac , but quite smaller than the difference by a factor @xmath203^{1 - 0.81}\\sim 100 $ ] predicted using the `` fast collapse '' .",
    "then , it appears that the ac formalism can be safely used at least for densities up to @xmath204 .",
    "it is quite possible ( and even likely ) that at higher density it will significantly overestimate the dm density . however",
    ", such overestimate will be large ( a maximum @xmath205 for @xmath206 ) but still reasonable in the range of densities where we perform our simulations .",
    "furthermore , we remark that the ac approach allows a better comparison with previous studies , and , given our conclusions , is the _ conservative _ choice ."
