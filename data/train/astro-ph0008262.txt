    "since butcher & oemler ( 1978 ) discovered a large fraction of blue galaxies in distant clusters of galaxies at the redshift @xmath1 , the origin of the blue color and physical processes closely associated with the formation of the distant blue populations have been extensively discussed by many authors ( dressler & gunn 1983 , 1992 ; lavery & henry 1986 ; couch et al .",
    "1994 , 1998 ; abraham et al . 1996",
    "; barger et al . 1996 ; fisher et al . 1998 ; morris et al .",
    "1998 ; balogh et al . 1999 ) .",
    "in particular , dressler & gunn ( 1983 , 1992 ) discovered galaxies with no detectable emission lines and very strong balmer absorption ones ( the so - called e+a galaxies ) and concluded that some fraction of distant blue populations are poststarburst galaxies that truncated abruptly their active star formation .",
    "one of longstanding and remarkable problems concerning the evolution of galaxies in cluster environment is to understand clearly a physical relationship between these blue populations , whose number fractions rapidly increase with redshift , and passive populations such as elliptical galaxies and s0s .",
    "several attempts have been made to clarify an evolutionary link among star - forming , poststarburst , and passively evolving galaxies observed in distant clusters of galaxies ( couch & sharples 1987 ; abraham et al .",
    "1996 ; barger et al . 1996 ; morris et al .",
    "1998 ; balogh et al . 1999 ) .",
    "it is however not so clear whether there is really an evolutionary link among these populations with various spectroscopic properties and what physical process can drive the evolution .",
    "recent observational studies have found a significant population of possible dusty starburst galaxies in distant clusters ( poggianti et al .",
    "1999 : owen et al . 1999 ; smail et al .",
    "1999 ) , which provide a new clue to the evolutionary link among various spectral classes .",
    "poggianti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggested that galaxies with strong balmer absorption and relatively modest [ oii ] emission , which are classified as `` e(a ) '' galaxies by dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , are dusty starburst galaxies and furthermore discussed that distant clusters have a significant fraction of these dusty starburst galaxies .",
    "smail et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that spectral properties of 5 out of 10 galaxies detected by 1.4 ghz vla radio observation are classified as poststarburst ( a+k / k+a type in dressler et al .",
    "1999 ) and considered that the star formation is hidden by dust in them .",
    "this finding suggested that dust effects are remarkable even for galaxies that were previously identified as poststarburst ones by optical spectral properties .",
    "although a growing number of observational results on e(a ) galaxies with possible dusty starburst have been accumulated , there are only a few theoretical studies addressing the formation and evolution of these e(a ) populations in distant clusters .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to investigate the origin and the nature of e(a ) population observed in distant clusters of galaxies by using a one - zone chemical and spectrophotometric evolution model .",
    "we particularly investigate whether dusty starburst galaxies can show both strong h@xmath0 absorption and relatively modest [ oii ] emission observed in distant e(a ) galaxies .",
    "we demonstrate that if a younger stellar population formed during a starburst is preferentially obscured by dust in a galaxy , spectral properties of the galaxy during starburst become very similar to those characteristics of e(a ) populations .",
    "we refer to this behavior of dust extinction as _ a selective dust extinction _ , which is originally proposed by poggianti and wu ( 2000 ) and means that the effect of dust extinction is maximum for the youngest stellar populations among stellar populations with different ages .",
    "we furthermore suggest that this selective extinction can be achieved in interacting and merging galaxies in distant clusters . in the followings ,",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 are set to be @xmath4 and 0.05 respectively , which means that the corresponding present age of the universe is 13.8 gyr .",
    "we adopt a one - zone chemical and spectrophotometric evolution model of a disk galaxy with a starburst , and thereby investigate when and how a disk galaxy shows strong h@xmath0 absorption line and relatively modest [ oii ] emission one characteristics of e(a ) spectra observed in distant clusters of galaxies . since more details of the adopted model are given in shioya & bekki ( 1998 , 2000 in preparation )",
    ", we only briefly describe the model in the present study .",
    "we follow the chemical evolution of galaxies by using the model described in matteucci & tornamb ( 1987 ) which includes metal - enrichment processes of type ia and ii supernovae ( snia and snii ) .",
    "we adopt the salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath5 , with upper mass limit @xmath6 and lower mass limit @xmath7 .",
    "we calculate photometric properties of galaxies as follows .",
    "the monochromatic flux of a galaxy with age @xmath8 , @xmath9 , is described as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a monochromatic flux of a single stellar population with age @xmath12 and metallicity @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is time - dependent star formation rate described later . in the present study , we use the spectral library gissel96 which is the latest version of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "the star formation history of a disk galaxy is characterized by three epochs .",
    "the first is the epoch of galaxy formation ( @xmath15 in redshift and the age of galaxy is 0 gyr ) at which a disk galaxy forms and begins to consume initial interstellar gas by star formation with the moderate rate . in the present study , @xmath15 is fixed at 4.5 and therefore the age of galaxies at @xmath16 is 12 gyr .",
    "the second is @xmath17 at which starburst begins in the disk . in the present study",
    ", @xmath17 is set at 0.4 and the age of galaxies at @xmath17 , @xmath18 , is 7.64 gyr .",
    "the third is @xmath19 at which star formation ceases and is defined as the epoch at which stellar mass fraction becomes 0.95 in our models .",
    "the age of galaxies at @xmath19 , @xmath20 , is 8.56 gyr . in the following",
    ", we mainly use the age of galaxies to describe their evolution . throughout the evolution of disk galaxies ,",
    "the star formation rate is assumed to be proportional to gas mass fraction ( @xmath21 ) of galaxies ; @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a parameter which controls the star formation rate .",
    "this parameter @xmath23 is given as follows : @xmath24 in the following , we refer the first , second , and third phases as the prestarburst , the starburst , and the poststarburst , respectively . in the present study , we set the value of @xmath25 as 0.225 @xmath26 , which corresponds to a plausible star formation rate for sb disks ( e.g. , arimoto , yoshii , & takahara 1992 ) .",
    "@xmath27 is considered to be 10 times larger than @xmath25 ( @xmath28 ) , which is consistent with observational results on starburst galaxies ( e.g. , planesas et al .",
    "figure  1 shows the star formation history of our model .",
    "we try to understand the role of the _ selective dust extinction _ in the formation of e(a ) galaxies by comparing the following two models with each other ; a model with no dust extinction ( from now on referred to as the @xmath29 model ) and the selective dust extinction model ( the @xmath30 model ) . in the @xmath29 model ,",
    "dust effects on photometric and spectroscopic properties are completely neglected ; i.e. , @xmath31 at all times . in the @xmath30 model",
    ", we assume that during starburst the value of @xmath32 depends on the age of stellar population ; i.e. , @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are parameters controlling the degree of extinction .",
    "we here set @xmath36 mag and @xmath37 yr .",
    "based on the monochromatic flux derived in the equation ( 1 ) and the value of @xmath32 from the equation ( 4 ) for each age of a galaxy @xmath8 , we calculated the sed of a galaxy corrected by dust extinction using the extinction law derived by cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and adopting the so - called screen model . for deriving the fluxes for various gaseous emission lines ( h@xmath0 and [ oii ] ) in dusty starburst galaxies ,",
    "we first calculate the number of lyman continuum photons , @xmath38 , by using the sed that are not modified by dust extinction .",
    "if all the lyman continuum photons are used for ionizing the surrounding gas , the luminosity of h@xmath39 is calculated according to the following formula ; @xmath40 ( leitherer & heckman 1995 ) . to calculate luminosities of other emission lines , e.g. , [ oii ] and h@xmath0",
    ", we use the relative luminosity to h@xmath39 luminosity tabulated in pegase ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) which is calculated for the set of electron temperature of 10000 k and electron density of 1 @xmath41 .",
    "thus the sed derived in the present study consists of stellar continuum and gaseous emission .",
    "figure  2 shows the time evolution of ew(h@xmath0 ) and ew([oii ] ) for the @xmath29 model and the @xmath30 one .",
    "first , we describe the evolution for the @xmath29 model",
    ". the equivalent width of [ oii ] decreases gradually before the starburst begins ( i.e. , at @xmath42 ) . at @xmath43 ,",
    "the equivalent width of [ oii ] increases rapidly following the rapid increase of star formation rate due to starburst and then decreases gradually with the decreasing star formation rate . during the starburst ,",
    "the equivalent width of [ oii ] is larger than 40  .",
    "after star formation ceases at @xmath44 and massive stars formed during starburst die out , the equivalent width of [ oii ] rapidly decreases and becomes smaller than 5  .",
    "the strength of equivalent width of h@xmath0 evolves as follows . during the prestarburst evolution phase ,",
    "the h@xmath0 line is observed as an absorption one and its equivalent width reaches the local maxima at around 3 gyr ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the strength of ew(h@xmath0 ) gradually decreases , and becomes about 3    just before starburst begins ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) . when starburst begins , the h@xmath0 line changes from an absorption line to an emission one and its equivalent width reaches @xmath48  .",
    "@xmath49 after the starburst begins , h@xmath0 line changes into absorption line again .",
    "since the flux of h@xmath0 emission line becomes negligibly small , the equivalent width of h@xmath0 reaches 8    when starburst ceases . as a result of passive evolution of galaxies after starburst ,",
    "the equivalent width of h@xmath0 decreases gradually : it becomes smaller than 7    at 8.8 gyr and 3    at 11 gyr .",
    "next we describe the evolution of the @xmath30 model .",
    "since we assume that the selective extinction affects spectroscopic properties of galaxies only in starburst phase , there is no difference in the evolution of ew([oii ] ) and ew(h@xmath0 ) between the @xmath30 model and the @xmath29 one in the prestarburst phase and the poststarburst one .",
    "we therefore pay our attention to the evolution of ew([oii ] ) and ew(h@xmath0 ) during starburst . in the @xmath30 model ,",
    "the equivalent width of [ oii ] does not increase ( but increases in the @xmath29 model ) and is below 40    during starburst .",
    "the equivalent width of h@xmath0 becomes rapidly small just after starburst begins , although the h@xmath0 line can be still observed as an absorption line .",
    "a few @xmath50 years after the starburst begins , the equivalent width of h@xmath0 becomes larger than 4  .",
    "the reason why the equivalent width of h@xmath0 of the @xmath30 model is always larger than that of the @xmath29 model is that the flux of h@xmath0 emission line of the @xmath30 model is smaller than that of @xmath29 model .",
    "figure  3 shows the evolution of galaxies on ew([oii])-ew(h@xmath0 ) plane for each model .",
    "the criteria of spectroscopic classification determined by dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) are also superimposed on it .",
    "the @xmath29 model is located within the e(b ) region during starburst and is very rapidly shifted to the a+k one just when starburst is ended .",
    "although , the locus of the @xmath29 model passes through the e(a ) region , the crossing time is @xmath51 years which is about 0.5 % of the duration of the starburst . on the other hand , the @xmath30 model can successfully show the spectroscopic properties of e(a ) galaxies , namely , strong h@xmath0 absorption line [ ew ( h@xmath0 ) @xmath52  ] and relatively modest [ oii ] emission line [ ew([oii ] ) @xmath53 5  ] , during the most of the starburst phase ( 0.7 gyr ) .",
    "this result accordingly suggests that a selective extinction plays a vital role in the formation of galaxies with e(a ) spectra .",
    "these results thus confirm the early suggestion by poggianti & wu ( 2000 ) that if the youngest stellar population is the most heavily obscured by dust in a dusty starburst galaxy , the e(a ) spectra can be achieved in the galaxy .    as is described above ,",
    "we have confirmed that the @xmath30 model shows the weaker [ oii ] emission and stronger h@xmath0 absorption compared with the @xmath29 model .",
    "the physical reason for the successful reproduction of the @xmath30 model can be understood in terms of the difference in the influence of dust extinction between continuum and emission lines .",
    "the emission lines come from the ionized gas around youngest stellar populations which are most heavily obscured by dust . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the continuum come from the stellar populations that are older and less obscured than younger ones dominating the ionizing photons .",
    "the flux of emission lines consequently is more greatly affected by dust extinction than that of stellar continuum .",
    "thus the @xmath30 model can show the smaller equivalent width of emission lines without changing so greatly the flux of continuum .",
    "poggianti & wu ( 2000 ) first discussed that if the dust extinction for a stellar population decreases with the stellar age , e(a ) spectra can be obtained for a starburst galaxy .",
    "they furthermore suggested that if the location and thickness of dust patches depend on the age of the embedded stellar populations in a starburst galaxy , the effects of the above selective dust extinction become remarkable for the galaxy .",
    "then , when and how the proposed difference in the degree of dust extinction between stellar populations with different ages is possible during galactic evolution in distant clusters ?",
    "we here suggest that the difference of dust extinction between the central region and the outer one in a galaxy is a main cause for the above age - dependent extinction . to be more specific , since younger stellar populations formed by secondary starburst in the central region with a larger amount of dusty interstellar gas are more heavily obscured by dust than the outer old components , the age - dependent extinction can be achieved .",
    "this radial dependence of dust extinction is considerably reasonable and realistic , considering that secondary dusty starburst occurs preferentially in the central part of a galaxy owing to efficient inward gas transfer driven by non - axisymmetric structure ( such as stellar bars ) and galaxy interaction and merging .",
    "numerical simulations on gaseous and stellar distribution in merging disk galaxies with dusty starburst furthermore have demonstrated that the central young stellar component formed by nuclear starburst is more heavily obscured by dusty gas than the outer old component initially located in merger progenitor disks ( bekki , shioya , & tanaka 1999 ) .",
    "thus we strongly suggest that galaxies with the central dusty starburst are more likely to show the selective dust extinction .",
    "future observational studies on the radial dependence of photometric and spectroscopic properties for e(a ) galaxies , which can reveal the detailed distribution of young dusty population and that of old one with less extinction , will assess the validity of the above idea for the origin of the selective dust extinction ( i.e. , the age - dependent extinction ) .",
    "then what physical process is closely associated with the radial dependence of dust extinction suggested above and thus with the formation of e(a ) galaxies in distant clusters ?",
    "we here suggest that minor and unequal - mass galaxy merging , which is different from major merging in that it can leave disk systems even after merging , is _",
    "one _ of possible candidates that can reproduce fundamental properties of e(a ) galaxies .",
    "mihos & hernquist ( 1994 ) has demonstrated that minor merging can excite non - axisymmetric structure in a late - type disk , trigger nuclear starburst , and transform the disk into an early - type disk such as sa and s0 .",
    "unequal - mass merging between two disks is furthermore demonstrated to create a disk with the structure and kinematics strikingly similar to those of s0s ( barnes 1994 ) , and furthermore bekki ( 1998 ) found that such merging can trigger nuclear starburst , form a very gas - poor disk , and create a remarkable bulge characteristic of typical s0s .",
    "these merging therefore not only contribute to the formation of dusty nuclear starburst and thus to the radial dependence of dust extinction but also provide an evolutionary link between late - type disks , e(a ) galaxies , and early - type disks ( s0 ) with the number fraction observed to decrease with redshift ( e.g. , dressler et al .",
    "1996 ) . an early - type disk galaxy formed by minor and unequal - mass merging experiences",
    "the post - starburst phase with k+a / a+k spectra after starburst and shows a remarkable bulge with young stellar populations and thus with bluer colors ( bekki 1998 ) .",
    "accordingly one of observational tests for assessing the relative importance of minor and unequal - mass merging in the fraction of e(a ) galaxies with the selective dust extinction is to investigate the number fraction of disk galaxies with k+a / a+k spectra and prominent blue bulges in distant clusters .",
    "we are grateful to the anonymous referee for valuable comments , which contribute to improve the present paper . y.s .",
