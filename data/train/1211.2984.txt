    "it exhibits unusual magnetic and transport properties.@xcite for example , the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility resembles very much that of cesn@xmath0 , as both compounds show a broad maximum around a characteristic temperature @xmath9 , which is about 200 k for cacu@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , an enhanced quasi - particle mass has been observed from specific heat measurements .",
    "it was proposed that the underlying mechanism could be the exchange interaction of localized magnetic cu@xmath10 ions with the itinerant ru @xmath11 electrons , which together constitute a kondo lattice .",
    "this would be reminiscent of the screening of localized @xmath12 moments in metallic rare earth compounds .",
    "this kondo picture seems to be supported by photoelectron spectroscopy studies@xcite which claim that a resonance - like peak should exist at the fermi level .",
    "if true , cacu@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2  may represent the rare case of a transition - metal based kondo system .    however , other findings oppose the kondo scenario .",

    "the charge state of cu was also discussed for cacu@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2,@xcite after valence degeneracy between cu and ru was proposed.@xcite with xas we show directly that cu is in a divalent state in cacu@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 , in accordance with the conclusions drawn from cu @xmath14 core level xps.@xcite interestingly , cu stays in this valence state upon doping , and it is the ru which gets affected .",
    "the slight changes in intensities in core level xps@xcite are then probably the result of a different effective ru - cu hybridization , as it was also suggested from data on thermopower of another set of doping series.@xcite    we infer from the band structure calculations that it is the particulars of the crystal structure that form the reason for the cu to possess a divalent state : although the cu is embedded in a metallic background and could be expected to be well - bound and have a full @xmath3 shell , the planar coordination and the resulting ligand field splitting raise the cu @xmath72 orbital in energy .",
    "this splitting is strong enough so that the @xmath72 orbital in one spin channel is completely shifted above the fermi energy as the gga+@xmath21 calculations have shown . a @xmath73 occupation with a localized moment is then formed .",
    "both cacu@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2  and lacu@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2  possess the basic ingredients for a possible kondo scenario : localized and correlated cu@xmath10 magnetic moments embedded in a background of itinerant conduction electrons , mostly of ru @xmath11 character .",
    "it is thus remarkable that a maximum in the magnetic susceptibility is present in cacu@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2  while it is absent in lacu@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "whether or not the presence of localized cu@xmath10 moments together with the itinerant ru electrons could lead to the formation of exotic magnetic states , comparable to the kondo effect in rare earth compounds , depends very much on the energetics and the character of the cu @xmath3 states closest to the fermi level .",
    "we know from earlier studies that the first ionization state of cuo and the undoped cuprates can be described as zhang - rice singlets.@xcite these correspond to states where the cu ions with @xmath73 occupation are surrounded by a hole on its oxygen ligands and they form together a bound singlet state . from our resonant pes experiments on cacu@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2  we find indications that the cu @xmath3 spectral weight does not extend completely up to the fermi level .",
    "there seems to be an energy distance of about 0.1  ev ( or larger since the resolution of our experiment is only 0.8  ev ) , meaning that it will be rather unlikely that zhang - rice singlets can be formed by a thermal excitation of an electron from a cu @xmath74 ion to the conduction band .",
    "our modeling of the resonant pes data using the full - multiplet calculations even suggests that these zhang - rice singlets are located at around 0.9  ev binding energy , quite a large value , see the mark labeled as @xmath75 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ef ] .",
    "we thus conclude that the energetics in cacu@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2  are not allowing a kondo - like scenario",
    ". it would be very interesting if ways could be found to bring these zhang - rice singlets closer to the fermi level , for example , by hole doping or by taking other @xmath11 transition metal ions .",
    "in summary , we have carried out x - ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy experiments to study the electronic structure of the cacu@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2  system .",
    "we established firmly the 2 + valence state of the cu ions .",
    "electron doping by the substitution of ca by la mostly affects the ru states in what appears to be a rigid band shift . from the comparison of the experimental valence band photoemission spectra to band structure and cluster configuration interaction calculations we found that the cu ions form local moments while the ru are more itinerant in character and stabilize the metallic state .",
    "we observed strong correlation effects in the cu @xmath3 spectral weight affecting the valence band line shape considerably . yet , from resonant photoemission at the cu @xmath14 ( @xmath4 ) edge we found indications that the first ionization states of the cu are too far from the fermi level to allow for the formation of zhang - rice singlets via thermal or virtual excitations .",
    "we wish to thank g.  a.  sawatzky , a.  loidl , s.  riegg , and m.  brando for fruitful discussions . we acknowledge support by the european union through the itn soprano network .",
