    "models of attractor neural networks for processing sequences of patterns , as a realization of a temporal association , have been of great interest following hopfield s pioneering work [ 1 - 7 ] and renewed interest has come through both , the availability of new theoretical dynamic approaches to study the evolution of disordered systems , in particular neural networks near saturation [ 8 - 12 ] and experimental findings . among the latter",
    "are the results of miyashita _ et al . _ who showed that serial positions of stimuli to which monkeys were exposed during training",
    "are converted to spatial correlations of neural activities @xcite .    a neural network model with a symmetric learning rule that consists of a hebbian part and",
    "a pair of pattern sequences has been proposed to interpret the experiments @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the equilibrium states for both finite and extensive loading of patterns , revealed the presence of correlated attractors with a decreasing correlation as the separation of the patterns in the sequence increases , in apparent support of the experimental work .",
    "phase diagrams were obtained where correlated attractors compete with hopfield - like attractors and with symmetric states @xcite .",
    "the dynamical evolution to the stationary states has been studied recently by means of dynamical replica theory @xcite .",
    "neural network models for sequence processing with asymmetric interactions are more natural from a biological point of view . due to the lack of microscopic detailed balance ,",
    "however , the equilibrium states of the network can not be obtained by means of the statistical mechanics approach @xcite , and one has to resort to a dynamical study . analytic and numerical studies of the stationary states and some aspects of the dynamics for the competition between pattern reconstruction and asymmetric sequence processing in the case of finite loading of patterns , that is in the absence of stochastic noise , where the ratio @xmath0 between the number of patterns @xmath1 and units @xmath2 is zero , appeared in works by coolen _",
    "phase diagrams for the stationary states of a parallel dynamics exhibit either stable hopfield - like or symmetric mixture states characterized by fixed - point solutions and stable limit cycles described by periodic fixed points .",
    "non - stationary solutions of the dynamics also appear for increasingly large number of patterns @xcite .",
    "more recent works deal with stationary limit cycles in asymmetric sequence processing without pattern reconstruction , for extensive loading of patterns [ 12,23 - 26 ] .",
    "it is important to consider the effects of extensive loading of patterns and to study the stability of the states that appear in the competition between pattern reconstruction and asymmetric sequence processing to the presence of stochastic noise ( finite @xmath3 ) .",
    "this noise could be due to the presence of a previously learnt macroscopic number of patterns following a specific learning rule . since the problem is a dynamical one , it is also important to study the dependence of the network performance on initial conditions",
    ".    those are issues that , apparently , have not been considered before and the purpose of the present paper is to study them on a tractable dynamical feed - forward layered neural network model with no feed - back loops @xcite .",
    "this is an extensively used model that consists of identical layers of @xmath2 non - interacting units on each layer , with synaptic interactions only between units on consecutive layers .",
    "the feed - forward nature of the model and the updating of the units on each layer endow the network of a dynamics in which the layer index becomes a discrete time .",
    "we consider an interaction matrix that yields either a static hebbian noise or a dynamic hebbian plus - sequential noise and restrict the work to binary units and patterns . in the finite loading case ,",
    "the model becomes identical to that of coolen and sherrington for a parallel dynamics @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "2 we present the model and the relevant order parameters . in sec .",
    "3 we derive the macroscopic dynamics of the network and in sec .",
    "4 we present the results in the form of phase diagrams of stationary states and regions of non - stationary solutions .",
    "we end with a discussion and conclusions in sec .",
    "the network model consists of @xmath4 layers with @xmath2 binary ising units ( neurons ) on each layer @xmath5 in a microscopic state @xmath6 , in which each @xmath7 .",
    "the state @xmath8 represents a firing neuron and the state @xmath9 a neuron at rest .",
    "the microscopic dynamics of the network is generated as follows : given a configuration on the first layer , @xmath10 , all units on layer @xmath11 are updated simultaneously according to the alignment of each unit @xmath12 to its local field @xmath13 due to the states of the units on the previous layer @xmath5 , following a stochastic law with probability @xmath14}{2 \\cosh[\\beta h_i(l+1))]}\\,\\,\\,\\ , .",

    ", @xmath15 is the synaptic connection defined below between unit @xmath16 on layer @xmath5 and unit @xmath12 on layer @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 controls the synaptic noise such that the dynamics of the network becomes a deterministic one when @xmath18 and fully random when @xmath19 . in the former case ,",
    "the state of a unit is given by the deterministic form @xmath20 \\,\\,\\ , .",

    "since we are interested in the retrieval of one or a small number @xmath26 of patterns and in the recognition of a finite sequence , we assume a learning rule of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 in which @xmath29 is non - zero only for @xmath30 .",
    "these are the ( layer independent ) elements of matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 , with continuous independent @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , in which @xmath36 if @xmath37 , and zero otherwise , while @xmath38 is a permutation matrix element .",
    "the signal - to - noise analysis carried out below depends on the assumption that the patterns can be separated into @xmath26 `` low '' or condensed ones , with finite overlaps with the states of the network in the @xmath39 limit and ( @xmath40 ) `` high '' or non - condensed patterns with overlaps of @xmath41 with the states .",
    "the assumption is justified in the case of a block - matrix interaction ( here , a diagonal two - block matrix ) and the specific form we choose is inspired in an earlier proposal @xcite . in that spirit",
    "we assume here not necessarily the same weights , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this is in order to contemplate different simple possibilities and to avoid an eventual closure problem in the noise term discussed below .",
    "the first part of @xmath15 represents a finite cycle which is a superposition of a hebbian learning ( the diagonal part of @xmath31 ) of single patterns and of patterns in a sequence ( the non - diagonal part ) .",
    "again , in the spirit of that reference , one may think of the condensed part in the presence of an infinite cycle ( in the large @xmath1 limit ) of a previously learnt similar superposition of hebbian and sequential patterns represented by the second part of @xmath15 , which acts as a noise . eventually , one could have @xmath42 and a hebbian noise with @xmath43 @xcite , which is a rather convenient choice .",
    "the learning stage of the network is a dynamical process that involves patterns on two consecutive layers .",
    "the hebbian part of the rule may be thought as a static process that reinforces the learning of the same pattern on every pair of consecutive layers ( times ) whereas the sequential part of the rule is a dynamic process in which the synaptic interaction is due to a pattern at a given time with the following pattern in the sequence at the next discrete time .",
    "it has been found before , in studying the finite loading case , that the competing static process has a stabilizing effect on the dynamic sequential process leading to a phase of symmetric states , which are the only ordered stable states within a wide range of relative synaptic strengths under an appropriate amount of synaptic noise parameter @xmath44 .",
    "eventually , the static process may fail to lock the transitions in the dynamic process and non - stationary quasi - periodic solutions may appear which have already been found in the case of finite loading @xcite .",
    "these are natural features of the model that are enhanced by stochastic noise ( finite @xmath3 ) as will be seen and discussed in this work .",
    "the properties of @xmath31 , in particular its eigenvalues and the complete set of orthogonal eigenvectors , lead to symmetries of the solutions of the non - linear parallel dynamics in the form of a @xmath45 duality , that has been discussed for finite loading of patterns @xcite .",
    "we find here an additional @xmath46 duality . for the case of continuous bifurcations of solutions , the eigenvalues of the matrix yield the transition temperatures to the ordered states and the eigenvectors give the symmetry directions of the macroscopic overlaps between the states of the network and the patterns .",
    "we define the macroscopic overlap between the configuration @xmath47 of the network on layer @xmath5 and one or more condensed key patterns @xmath48 , @xmath49 , on that layer as the large - n limit , @xmath50 , of @xmath51 where the brackets denote a thermal average with eq.(2 ) . since the number of condensed patterns is finite , one may use the self - averaging property to write @xmath52 , where the outer bracket here and below denotes a configurational average over the patterns .",
    "similarly , we define the overlap between the same configuration and a given non - condensed pattern @xmath48 , @xmath53 , on layer @xmath5 , @xmath54 assuming that a given configuration of the first layer has a finite overlap @xmath55 with one or more condensed patterns and overlaps @xmath56 with the non - condensed patterns , the dynamic evolution of the network will yield overlaps @xmath57 and @xmath58 on the following layers .",
    "we consider next the evolution equations for the overlaps .",
    "adapting the standard procedure for the layered network to our model , we write the local field at a unit on layer @xmath11 due to the overlaps with all patterns on layer @xmath5 , in the large - n limit @xcite , @xmath59 where the first term is the signal and @xmath60 is the large - n limit of the noise @xmath61 due to the overlaps of the states with the non - condensed patterns .",
    "this is a random quantity in both the patterns on layer @xmath11 and the implicit dependence on thermal and configurational randomness of the overlaps @xmath62 on layer @xmath5 due to the previous layers .",
    "the noise gives a finite contribution to the local field .",
    "indeed , due to the fact that @xmath58 and that @xmath63 is a sum of a large number of statistically independent random variables , one can first apply the central limit theorem and then the law of large numbers to conclude that @xmath60 follows a gaussian distribution with mean zero and a variance @xmath64 given by the large - n limit of @xmath65^{2}\\rangle\\rangle   \\,\\,\\ , .",

    "indeed , the system of relations may not form a closed and finite set and there is no guaranty that this is not , in general , the case . fortunately , by working out numerically the equations for the dynamics in all the cases we were interested in this work we found that the set of recursion relations is practically finite and one proceeds as follows .",

    "there may also exist other solutions , as non - stationary states , as will be seen in the next section . solving for @xmath98 , searching for fixed - point solutions and for non - stationary states",
    "one finds that only a small number of the @xmath93 s on the @xmath99-cycle of non - condensed overlaps are clearly non - zero and all others vanish .",

    "we concentrate on a small number of macroscopic condensed overlaps , specifically @xmath102 and @xmath103 , since the results depend on whether @xmath26 is even or odd , with the remaining @xmath40 patterns as noise in the case of extensive loading .",

    "the same applies to all other phase diagrams in this paper where the q - p solutions are shown .",
    "it is worth noting that the symmetric states are the only stable states in the @xmath109 region due to the stabilizing effect of the static condensed patterns in the learning rule and that this is a characteristic feature of the model , as discussed in sec .",
    "2 . note that the symmetric states are enhanced by synaptic noise .",
    "eventual alterations of the learning rule aimed at eliminating what has been termed as `` spurious '' ( here not at all ) symmetric mixture states , say by means of the introduction of a bias in the distribution of the patterns @xcite , would leave nothing but the non - stationary q - p states over a large region of the phase diagram .",

    "coming back to the more symmetric initial condition for @xmath103 , one finds quite larger regions of stable symmetric states and of non - stationary q - p solutions and particularly smaller regions of @xmath148 and @xmath149 phases for both @xmath134 and for @xmath145 .",
    "we studied in this work the dynamics of the competition between pattern reconstruction and asymmetric sequence processing in an exactly solvable feed - forward layered neural network model for both finite and for extensive loading of patterns .",
    "the strictly feed - forward nature of the network makes it an ideal system to study the dynamics as a discrete - time evolution .",
    "given the initial overlaps as inputs on the sites of the first layer , the dynamics is generated by random local fields at every site on the next layer which depend on the synaptic interaction between units on the two layers . in turn , the local fields determine the probability of updating of units at the sites of that layer .",
    "the asymmetry of the sequence processing in this work refers to the sequential part of the learning rule that consists of a synaptic interaction connecting a pattern on a layer with the consecutive pattern in the sequence on the next layer .",
    "a symmetric sequence processing , not considered in this work , would involve an additional synaptic interaction of the same strength connecting a pattern on a layer with the _ previous _ pattern in the sequence on the next layer .",
    "we come back to this issue below .",
    "the model studied here is based on the superposition of a hebbian and a sequential learning rule for a finite cycle of condensed patterns and a stochastic noise due to a previously learnt macroscopic set of either single patterns that follow a hebbian rule or a superposition of sequential patterns in a cycle with single patterns .",
    "the superposition we consider is suitable for the study of the competition between pattern reconstruction and asymmetric sequence processing .",
    "we were especially interested in the effects of finite synaptic noise ( @xmath150 ) on the performance phase diagrams that appear in the case of extensive loading of patterns .",
    "naively , one may expect that the form of the noise does not make a great difference , as we found in most of this work , but this is not always the case .",
    "new dynamic equations for the overlaps and for the variance of the gaussian noise were obtained in the form of discrete - time recursion relations for extensive loading of patterns . in the case of a hebbian plus sequential learning rule with a macroscopic number of patterns @xmath21 , the variance of the noise depends on a macroscopic number of correlations between overlaps with non - condensed patterns , @xmath151 .",
    "all these correlations could be relevant for the dynamics but when it comes to the fixed points ( and stationary cycles ) only a small number of them survives making the sequence processing a tractable and solvable problem , at least in the relevant cases we considered in this work .",
    "in all the cases we studied the correlations between overlaps with non - condensed patterns formed , practically , a finite and tractable set .",
    "explicit phase diagrams of stable states and regions of non - stationary solutions were obtained in this work that show the effects of stochastic noise due to a macroscopic number of learnt patterns , and different behaviors may be obtained depending on a variety of relevant parameters .",
    "we also considered , briefly , the optimal case where @xmath145 in the synapses that generate the noise .",
    "the reason why this yields a larger @xmath146 for @xmath111 or zero is that the symmetric phase is considerably enhanced towards extreme values of @xmath33 combined with the fact that hopfield - like retrieval in this model is , in general , more robust to stochastic noise than the stable symmetric states for small or large @xmath33 .    some general conclusions that may be drawn from the phase diagrams are the following .",
    "first , as expected , the retrieval quality of hopfield - like and cyclic states is gradually reduced with an increase in the storage ratio @xmath3 .",
    "less obvious , there is also a reduction in nearly single - pattern retrieval or in cycle retrieval as @xmath33 or @xmath152 are decreased , respectively",
    ". the change may be either to a symmetric state or to a spin - glass state .",
    "eventually , depending on the form of the noise due to the previously learnt patterns , the transition could be to non - stationary quasi - periodic states .",
    "the symmetric states appear as a locking of the sequential transitions by the static hebbian part of the learning rule .",
    "a further result of our work is that , for a hopfield type initial condition @xmath133 , the first - order phase boundaries in the ( @xmath153 ) phase diagrams where the hopfield - like phase ends is practically the same for small @xmath3 and either hebbian or complete noise , for both @xmath103 and for @xmath102 .",
    "that is also the case for the ( @xmath154 ) phase diagrams at @xmath98 .",
    "turning now to predictions for somewhat larger , finite values of @xmath26 , either even or odd for hopfield type initial conditions , we expect that the non - stationary solutions that appear in the finite loading case for small @xmath44 @xcite should disappear as soon as @xmath3 becomes non - zero , allowing for the presence of a symmetric phase down to @xmath98 , leaving a phase diagram with essentially no q - p solutions .    it may be pointed out that there is a similarity between our ( @xmath154 ) phase diagrams at @xmath98 , with initial hopfield type overlaps , and the corresponding phase diagram for pattern reconstruction and _ symmetric _ sequence processing referred to above obtained by means of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the case of pure sequential processing is not considered in that work and , instead of a single - pattern retrieval region found there , we have here a hopfield - like region ( a difference already noted in the context of finite loading @xcite ) . the boundaries of either of these regions have a similar dependence with the ratio @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , there are similar regions of symmetric phases and , in contrast to our work , there is also a region of correlated states .",
    "based on the experience with the feed - forward layered network to process information with a hebbian learning rule , one may expect qualitatively similar results to those obtained here to apply for a recurrent network with a hebbian - plus - sequential learning rule .",
    "most of the work reported here deals with the dynamics near stationary states . since our recursion relations for the overlaps and for the noise",
    "are general for the layered network model , they may also be employed to study the transients of the dynamics , in particular to find out what makes the correlations between distant ( in pattern space ) high components of the overlaps vanish .",
    "one may also study the slowing down of the dynamics due to the macroscopic number of non - condensed patterns .",
    "work along some of these lines is currently in progress .    as an extension of this work one may study the performance of this model with a number of sequences .",
    "there is recent work only with sequential learning , for an infinite number of limit cycles @xcite .",
    "we point out that there is renewed interest in sequence learning from a biological point of view @xcite and that asymmetric networks have been found to be computationally superior @xcite .",
