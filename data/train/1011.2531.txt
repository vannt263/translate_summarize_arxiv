    "many numerical method have been proposed to solve partial differential equations .",
    "many of the proposed method is for spatial modeling . in spite of the variety of the spatial modeling",
    ", temporal modelings may not have been proposed so many .    as for the temporal modeling",
    ", when you solve a harmonic oscillating model in time , the time differentiation can be replace with @xmath0 .",
    "when you solve a transient model in time , the time differentiation is replaced with finite differentiation .",
    "the finite differentiation can be said to be the most popular method for the transient numerical solution .",
    "the finite differentiation can be classified roughly into two categories .",
    "one is the explicit scheme and the rest is the implicit scheme @xcite .",
    "the explicit scheme is easy to program and the amounts of computation for advancing one time step is smaller than the implicit method .",
    "one of the bad things is the time step width must be small enough to satisfy a condition otherwise numerical instability may occur . as for the implicit scheme , the computation is generally large for one time step but it is always stable for any time step width . from the user s point of view",
    "the explicit method may be comfortable for programming .    in the meantime ,",
    "green s functions are well used in theoretical physics but are not used in the numerical transient problems .",
    "this is because if you adopt green s function to solve a certain transient problem you have to integrate all over the history in time and space for each time step .",
    "although the green s function may not be suitable for numerical simulation , the green s function is the response function of the basic equation against dirac s @xmath1 function or another functions .",
    "this means that the green s function gives the exact time variation of the system against a certain stimulation .",
    "the reason of the instability of the explicit finite difference method ( fdm ) is caused from the difficulty of the approximation of @xmath2 with the several order of polynomials of @xmath3 .",
    "there is no physical or mathematical inevitability for the approximation . whereas the green s function is the exact solution of the basic equation so the time variation predicted by the green s function has the inevitability .",
    "it is a big motivation that the benefit of the green s function is to be integrated into the explicit time advancing to formulate a stable explicit scheme irrespective of any time step width .",
    "the present paper describes a new scheme for transient solutions using green s function to solve inhomogeneous linear differential equation with constant coefficients . although the scheme is a explicit scheme , it is always stable irrespective of any time step width different from the explicit fdm .",
    "the preliminary works was applied to electromagnetics and diffuse equations @xcite@xcite@xcite . in the present paper the general formulation of the scheme",
    "is described .    in the paper , generalized basic formulation",
    "is derived in section [ sec : basic ] .",
    "section [ sec : tgm ] describes specific formulations for wave and diffuse equations .",
    "numerical simulation using the proposed method is investigated in section [ sec : numerical ] to show the effectiveness of the presented method .",
    "the numerical accuracy and stability is discussed in section [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "suppose a partial differential equation , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are partial differential operator with respect to time @xmath7 , space @xmath8 and a certain physical value , respectively .",
    "the partial differential operators @xmath5 are represented as , @xmath9 where @xmath10 are constant values .",
    "the authors are now interested in solving eq.([eq : the_eq ] ) to obtain the transient solution @xmath6 for the given source function @xmath11 .    to solve the eq.([eq : the_eq ] ) by the proposed method , fourier transformation is applied to the basic equation at first .",
    "a physical value can be expressed with integral form of fourier components as , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the wave number .",
    "substituting eq.([eq : fourier ] ) into eq.([eq : the_eq ] ) we have , @xmath14 where @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 is fourier components with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "suppose a homogeneous equation relating eq.([eq : basic_eq ] ) , @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "the general solution of eq.([eq : homo ] ) is obtained as , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the multiplicity of the solution @xmath23 , @xmath23 is the solution of @xmath24 which is the eigen equation of eq.([eq : homo ] ) .",
    "let @xmath22 be 1 , which means there is no multiplicity we have simplified general solution of eq.([eq : homo ] ) .",
    "@xmath25    to obtain explicit scheme for the numerical solution of eq.([eq : basic_eq ] ) we should have a recurrence formulation with respect to time step @xmath26 .",
    "the explicit scheme is obtained directly from eq.([eq : gen_sol ] ) as , @xmath27 where @xmath28    here the authors introduce a state variable @xmath29 for numerical formulation , which is defined as , @xmath30 then the authors have explicit scheme for the eq.([eq : homo ] ) , @xmath31    general solution of eq.([eq : homo ] ) have been evaluated with a condition of no - multiplicity of the eigen values .",
    "the derived formulation is recursive with respect to time step .",
    "this means @xmath32 can be obtained from the state variable of one time step before .",
    "now the authors consider the general solution of eq.([eq : homo ] ) .",
    "the authors introduce an impulse function in order to obtain the general numerical solution of the inhomogeneous equation ( [ eq : basic_eq ] ) , @xmath33            suppose the green s function @xmath34 of eq.([eq : basic_eq ] ) with respect to the impulse function which satisfies the equation ; @xmath35    a certain source function @xmath36 can be approximated with superposition of the impulse functions as , @xmath37 where the time series @xmath38 is given .",
    "equation ( [ eq : f_green ] ) is a linear equation so a superposition of the solutions is also its solution . from eqs.([eq : sn]),([eq : f_green ] ) we obtain a superposed solution as , @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "the authors split summation in eq.([eq : super ] ) into two parts to obtain an explicit scheme for the eq.([eq : basic_eq ] ) , @xmath41 if @xmath40 , the first term of the right hand of the eq.([eq : gen_ex ] ) is the solution of eq.([eq : homo ] ) .",
    "so the first term can be described as , @xmath42    now we have the explicit scheme to solve eq.([eq : basic_eq ] ) with the proposed method in a general form .",
    "@xmath43    in the following section we will investigate two concrete examples using the proposed scheme .",
    "we present two examples of the proposed formulation for solving partial differential equations which is derived in the present section .",
    "first one is a wave equation and second is a diffuse equation .",
    "they both have constant coefficients .      here",

    "@xmath63 same as the procedure deriving the formulation for the wave equation we have an equation to consider as , @xmath64 equation ( [ eq : g_eq_dif ] ) can be solved analytically and then we have , @xmath65 same as the formulation of the wave equation we have the explicit form of the solution as , @xmath66 where @xmath67    in the next section we will verify the effectiveness of the obtained formulations by applying to a simple one dimensional problems .",

    "the error is evaluated form eq.([eq : error_est ] ) same as the case of wave equation .    .",
    "]    figure [ fig : difuse_err ] shows numerical instability is occurred with the violation of cfl condition whereas the results of the tgm does nt show any numerical instability irrespective of any time step width .",
    "the fdm is the euler s scheme so the error is @xmath74 . according to the fig.[fig : difuse_err ] , tgm has accuracy of @xmath75 .",
    "the numerical error of the proposed scheme potentially contains the discretization errors in time and space .",
    "the spatial accuracy of tgm is determined by the fourier transformation .",

    "so discretization error of eqs.([eq : tgm_wave]),([eq : tgm_difuse ] ) is @xmath76 .",
    "if you adopt more accurate integration scheme the accuracy of the proposed scheme also becomes more accurate .",
    "the numerical stability of the proposed method is discussed in the section .    as for the finite difference method",
    "the explicit scheme is unstable unless the time step width @xmath3 is small enough to satisfy a condition .",
    "the criteria is well known as courant friedrichs and lewy ( cfl ) condition .",
    "for instance cfl condition of the simple explicit scheme for diffuse equation ( [ eq : diffuse ] ) is ; @xmath77 if the condition is violated the simulation result may be far from the exact solution which you want to obtain .",
    "the unstableness comes from the difficulty in approximating the solution with first or second order polynomials . while the proposed method is derived from the superposition of the green s function which are analytical solutions .",
    "now we consider the numerical stability of the tgm solution for eq.([eq : homo ] ) .",
    "the tgm formulation is given by eq.([eq : tgm_gen_sol ] ) .",
