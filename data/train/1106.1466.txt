    "in the last decades , soft magnetic materials have been deeply investigated .",
    "besides the basis scientific interest in their magnetic properties , there are a great deal of technologic interest due to their use in sensing applications , particularly in the fields of automotive , mobile communication , medical and home appliance industries .",
    "@xcite moreover , these materials are very promising for spintronic devices in magnetic recording media .",
    "@xcite  two types of soft magnetic microwire families are currently studied : in - water quenched amorphous wires with diameters of around 120 @xmath3 m , @xcite and quenched and drawn microwires with diameters ranging from around 2 to 20 @xmath3 m , @xcite covered by a protective insulating glassy coat .",
    "bi - stable microwires are characterized by square - shaped hysteresis loops defined by the abrupt reversal of the magnetization between two stable remanent states .",
    "@xcite    although an array composed of a few ferromagnetic wires could in principle seem a quite simple problem to study and model , it is striking to notice how complex this problem can turn out to be .",
    "effects of interparticle interactions are in general complicated by the fact that the dipolar fields depend upon the magnetization state of each element , which in turn depends upon the fields due to adjacent elements .",
    "therefore , the modelling of interacting arrays of wires is often subject to strong simplifications like , for example , modelling the wire using a one - dimensional modified classical ising model .",
    "@xcite zhan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used the dipole approximation including additionally a length correction .",
    "j. velzquez and m. vzquez @xcite considered each microwire as a dipole , in a way that the axial field generated by a microwire is proportional to its magnetization .",
    "nevertheless , this model is merely phenomenological since the comparison of experimental results with a strictly dipolar model shows that the interaction in the actual case is more intense .",
    "they have also calculated the magnetostatic field and expanded it in multipolar terms , @xcite showing that the non - dipolar contributions of the field are non negligible for distances considered in experiments . besides , the magnetostatic interaction energy between two magnetic elements of arbitrary shape was derived within the framework of a fourier space approach by beleggia _",
    "et al_. @xcite recently , a detailed study of the magnetostatic interaction between two parallel wires placed side by side has been shown .",
    "@xcite in spite of the extended study of the dipolar interactions , the effect of magnetostatic interactions on the hysteresis loops , due to the vertical displacement of the wires , has not been studied yet .",
    "the purpose of this work is to develop an analytical model for the full long - range magnetostatic interaction between two microwires exploring the possibility of varying the magnetic coupling as a function of the wires position .",
    "the geometry of the wires is characterized by their external radii @xmath4 and length @xmath5 , as depicted in fig .",
    "the separation between the wires is written in terms of the interaxial distance , @xmath6 , and the horizontal separation , @xmath7 , as depicted in fig .",
    "our model goes beyond the dipole - dipole approximation and lead us to obtain an analytical expression for the interaction in which the lengths and radii of the wires are taken into account .",
    "we focus on the interacting force in pairs of interacting wires , as a function of the distance between them , in order to gain insight on the understanding of the role of interactions on the plateaux that appears in the hysteresis loops .",
    "is the interaxial distance and @xmath7 is the horizontal separation.,width=302 ]",
    "the experimental meaurements have been performed in glass coated amorphous bi - stable magnetic microwires with nominal composition fe@xmath0si@xmath1b@xmath2 , with a saturation magnetization @xmath8 a / m , radii of @xmath9 @xmath3 m , and the thickness of the glass coating of @xmath10 @xmath3 m .",
    "they are fabricated by means of taylor - ulitovsky technique by which the molten metallic alloy and its glassy coating are rapidly quenched and drawn to a kind of composite microwire .",
    "two samples with length of @xmath11 mm each were cut from a larger wire and fixed parallel by means of vacuum grease on a glass holder , with a separaton of @xmath12 @xmath3 m between the wires .",
    "the morphology of microwires was investigated by a retro - optical microscope ( olimpus ) .",
    "the hysteresis curves were measured on a specially designed vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) , inserted within a pair of helmholtz coils .",
    "these coils have sufficient field to saturate the wires and present the advantage of field homogeneity and the absence of remanent fields .",
    "we will focus our attention on measurements performed at room temperature because a low temperature there is a change in the domain structure of the microwires , probably owing to the increasing internal stresses induced by the different thermal expansion coefficients of the ferromagnetic alloy and the covering glass .",
    "we adopt a simplified approach in which the discrete distribution of magnetic moments of microwire is replaced by a continuous one characterized by a slowly varying magnetization @xmath13 .",
    "we consider wires for which @xmath14 so it is reasonable to assume an axial magnetization due to shape anisotropy , defined by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the unit vector parallel to the wire axis .",
    "the magnetostatic interaction between wires can be calculated from @xcite@xmath17where @xmath18 is the magnetization of the wire @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the magnetostatic potential of the microwire @xmath21 .",
    "the expression for this potential is given by@xmath22note that the first term on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( 1 ) vanishes , because the magnetization field is constant ; furthermore , in the surface integral of eq . ( 1 ) the only contributions arise from the upper and lower bases of the wire : the upper circle is located at @xmath23 and the lower on at @xmath24 . due to the symmetry of the problem , we used the adecuate type of the cylindrical kernel for the integral @xcite , and after few manipulations , one finds that the integral expression for the scalar potential is given by @xmath25where @xmath26 is a bessel function of first kind and @xmath27 order .",
    "now it is possible to calculate the magnetostatic interaction energy between two identical microwires using the magnetostatic field experienced by one of the wires due to the other .",
    "the final results reads@xmath28equation ( 3 ) has been previously obtained for nanotubes .",
    "@xcite the general expression for the interaction energy between wires with axial magnetization , given by eq .",
    "( 3 ) , can only be solved numerically .",
    "however , wires that motivated this work satisfy @xmath29 , in which case one can use that @xmath30 . with this approximation , eq .",
    "( 3 ) can be written in a very simple form as @xmath31    finally , the magnetostatic field can be written as a function of the magnetostatic interaction between the magnetic microwires and is given by@xcite@xmath32",
    "figure 3 shows the hysteresis loop for two microwires of radii of @xmath9 @xmath33 m , length of @xmath11 mm , thickness of the glass coating of @xmath10 @xmath3 m , and interaxial separation @xmath12 @xmath3 m at room temperature .",
    "as observed , the magnetization process takes place in two steps : a jump near @xmath34 oe , that must be ascribed to the reversion of a microwire ; and an additional jump near @xmath35 oe , corresponding to the reversion of the other microwire .",
    "the flat region before the second step corresponds to the magnetic field felt by one wire due to the other .",
    "si@xmath36b@xmath2.,width=302 ]      theoretical and experimental magnetostatic results are combined in fig .",
    "experimental data for the magnetostatic field for different values of the interaxial separation @xmath6 are depicted by gray dots and the theoretical prediction is represented by the solid line . for the analytical calculations we have used an effective radii of @xmath37 @xmath3 m .",
    ", which is smaller than the real radius , in order to compensate the approximation of consider a homogeneous magnetization in our model .",
    "@xcite it is clear that there is a strong dependence of the magnetostatic field on @xmath6 .",
    "note the good agreement between experimental datapoints and analytical results for distances smaller than 80 @xmath3 m .",
    "the coupling rapidly decreases by increasing the separation between the wires , and become negligible for interaxial distances bigger than 80 @xmath3 m , at least within our experimental sensitivity .",
    "it can be understood if we consider that the stray field felt by one wire due to the other changes considerably if the wires are not completely parallel to each other .",
    "thus , when the separation between the wires is big enough , small deviations may reduce the stray field produced by the wires .",

    "our results are combined in fig .",
    "experimental data for the magnetostatic field of the system are depicted by gray dots and the solid line represents the analytical calculation .",

    "in summary , we have investigated the magnetostatic interaction between magnetic microwires . using a continuous model we have obtained a simple expression to model the magnetostatic interaction in these particles . from our calculations and measurements",
