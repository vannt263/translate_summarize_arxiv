    "the last decades have inaugurated great success in precise _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations for few - body scattering processes @xcite .",
    "these calculations made it possible to describe accurately the results of numerous recent experiments on elastic @xmath2 scattering at energies up to 350 mev and also the three - body breakup @xmath0 at low and moderate energies @xmath3 mev .",
    "however some problems remain unsettled even at such low energies .",
    "these are the so - called @xmath4-puzzle ( as well as other puzzles for various tensor and vector analyzing powers ) in elastic scattering , the problems with an adequate description of the pairwise @xmath5-channel contribution to three - body breakup at low energies @xcite and breakup cross section in some particular three - particle configurations such as the quasi - free scattering @xcite and the space - star @xcite configurations .",
    "the most plausible reason for the visible discrepancies with experimental data in this area is likely not insufficient accuracy of numerical calculations but rather some deficiency in the input @xmath6- and @xmath7-interactions . at the same time",
    ", the progress in the field of precise few - nucleon calculations , particularly in testing of new models for @xmath7-interactions , is restrained strongly by a high number of very complicated few - nucleon calculations , especially above the three - body threshold . because of these complications of traditional computational schemes for the direct solution of the faddeev ",
    "yakubovsky equations , one observes a rise of interest in recent years in alternative approaches @xcite to calculate the scattering observables by simpler methods .    among such alternative approaches one can note a preference for the so called @xmath8-methods . these methods are based on expansions of the scattering solution into a basis of square - integrable functions @xcite .",
    "such @xmath8-methods proved to be very well suited and quite efficient for numerous applications .",
    "one of the most successful approaches of this type is the continuum - discretized coupled - channel ( cdcc ) method developed three decades ago for treatment of breakup processes in direct nuclear reactions @xcite .",
    "the cdcc approach in its traditional form was unable to treat other channels than elastic scattering and projectile ( or target ) breakup .",
    "recently a few groups generalized the traditional cdcc approach to scattering of three - fragment projectiles by a stable target @xcite .",
    "however this generalized approach can be considered as a hybrid method : @xmath8 discretization of inner motion in the three - body projectile and the traditional treatment of a coupled - channel problem    on the other hand , the present authors have developed some alternative @xmath8-technique @xcite which is based on the idea of complete continuum discretization with a special stationary wave - packet basis in momentum space ( three - body lattice basis ) .",
    "the basic distinction of such an approach from the traditional cdcc - scheme for the three - body systems is that the wave - packet approach is dealing with a full discretization of the three - body continuum . in other words ,",
    "the discretization on _ both _",
    "jacobi coordinates is used here rather than the discretization on the alone coordinate of the projectile inner motion as in the cdcc approach2 scattering and also the breakup @xmath9 process using the laguerre polynomial basis .",
    "unfortunately this prospective approach has not received any further development . ] .",
    "our approach with the global discretization over all valence coordinates leads immediately to a few important advantages in the accurate treatment of few - body scattering . among those the following are the most important :    * the few - body scattering problem is consistently formulated in a hilbert space of three - body _ normalized _ states , similarly to the bound - state problem . *",
    "the approach employs the integral equation framework of scattering theory instead of the differential equation approach ( e.g. in the cdcc ) where the boundary conditions in few - body scattering channels are not easy to formulate , especially in terms of the @xmath8 basis used .",
    "contrary to this , the integral equation formulation allows to avoid any explicit account of the boundary conditions . *",
    "when working within the wave - packet formulation of the scattering problem one can derive explicit formulas for some scattering operators ( e.g. channel resolvents ) .",
    "such fully analytical finite - dimensional approximations , being substituted into integral equation kernels , lead immediately to their algebraic matrix analogues .",
    "thus , our final equations are simple matrix linear equations with regular matrices .    in our previous works",
    "@xcite we have demonstrated how to find the elastic @xmath10 scattering amplitudes in lattice representation . in the present paper , we generalize the technique to the three - body breakup treatment .",
    "so we present here the complete formalism for determination of three - body breakup amplitudes .",
    "it is important to emphasize in this connection that the accurate treatment of three - body breakup within the @xmath8 type approach is much less obvious than that of elastic ones and thus requires some additional delicate theoretical studies . in particular ,",
    "the matrix elements in the breakup amplitude are not truncated over all spatial coordinates ( in contrast to the elastic and rearrangement amplitudes ) , so the validity of the @xmath8 scheme in the treatment of the breakup processes should be studied carefully . as some substantiation for such approach",
    "one can consider the three - body breakup calculations within the cdcc - approach where the discretization of the continuum in the projectile inner subhamiltonian has been used for the description of the breakup amplitudes @xcite .",
    "so , the natural generalization of such a partial continuum discretization to the case of full three- and few - body continuum within the faddeev equation approach is an important next step .",
    "moreover , this fully discretized approach studied in the present work allows to simplify drastically all calculations and makes it more universal and elegant .",
    "the present work has the following structure . in the section",
    "ii , a three - body lattice - like free wave - packet basis is described in detail together with a similar basis for the channel hamiltonian .",
    "here we also discuss the properties of these bases .",
    "the complete formalism for elastic scattering and breakup , as applied to the @xmath2-system in the packet representation is presented in section iii . in the section iv ,",
    "a few useful numerical illustrations and their comparison with the standard faddeev benchmark calculations are given .",
    "our results are summarized in the section v. for the sake of convenience for the reader we add three appendices . in appendix",
    "a we describe the detailed scheme for calculation of the three - body overlap matrix in the three - body lattice basis for recoupling of different jacobi coordinates . in appendix",
    "b we give the convenient wave - packet formalism for the solution of three - body scattering problem with separable pairwise interactions . in the last appendix c",
    "we discuss some features of our numerical calculations .",
    "we consider here the problem of a scattering of three identical particles 1 , 2 and 3 ( nucleons ) with mass @xmath11 , interacting via pairwise short - range potentials @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "it is convenient to use three jacobi momentum sets @xmath14 corresponding to three channel hamiltonians @xmath15 @xmath13 which define the asymptotic states of the system .",
    "for example , the channel hamiltonian @xmath16 has the form of the direct sum of two - body subhamiltonians @xmath17 where subhamiltonian @xmath18 describes @xmath1 subsystem consisting of particles 2 and 3 with interaction @xmath19 and subhamiltonian @xmath20 corresponds to the free motion of nucleon 1 relative to center of mass of the subsystem \\{23}.    as we study the identical particle system , we will omit further , where it is possible , the jacobi index @xmath21 .",
    "we start from the free - motion three - body hamiltonian defined in the given jacobi momentum set ( * p , q * ) @xmath22 where the subhamiltonian @xmath23 defines the free motion of two nucleons with the relative momentum @xmath24 and the subhamiltonian @xmath25 defines the free motion of the third nucleon with the momentum @xmath26 relative to the center of mass of given @xmath1 subsystem .",
    "now we will construct our three - body @xmath8 basis using discretization of the continua of the two above subhamiltonians . in doing this",
    "we will employ the complete sets of continuum wave functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( for every partial wave ) normalized according to the conditions : @xmath29    when discretizing , we truncate the continuum of @xmath23 and @xmath25 by maximal values @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , so that the continuous spectra above these values can be neglected .",
    "further , the selected energy regions @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath33 $ ] are divided onto non - overlapping bins @xmath34_{i=1}^m\\}$ ] and @xmath35_{j=1}^n\\}$ ] .",
    "such energy bins correspond to momentum bins @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 $ ] , so that the end - points of both sets are interrelated by conventional formulas @xmath38 and @xmath39 . to further simplify the notation",
    ", we will denote the intervals in the variable @xmath40 ( both the energy and momentum ones ) as @xmath41 and in the variable @xmath42 as @xmath43 .",
    "we use also the following notations for the widths of the corresponding momentum intervals : @xmath44    now let s define a set of _ free _ stationary wave packets ( wps ) as integrals of the plane waves ( corresponding to the _ free _ motion ) over the above momentum bins for both subhamiltonians : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are some known weight functions and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are normalization factors , directly related to the weight functions @xmath50 so that the wp states are normalized to unity : @xmath51 it is important to stress , these wp states belong to _ a hilbert space _ ( similarly to the bound state functions ) and wp functions are square - integrable : in configuration space they vanish at infinity in contrast to the initial plane waves .",
    "but in the relevant restricted range of configuration space the wp states still resemble quite closely the exact scattering states taken at the bin center energy ( or momentum ) @xcite .",
    "the sets of such wp states @xmath52 and @xmath53 form an orthonormalized bases in hilbert space which can be used as normal @xmath8 bases , e.g. also for variational calculations .    in our previous papers @xcite we have discussed the properties of wp s in detail .",
    "a distinctive feature of wp bases is that the matrices of the subhamiltonians found in such bases are diagonal : @xmath54 where values @xmath55 and @xmath56 are defined via corresponding end - points of bins @xmath41 and @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the most useful property of wps is that the matrices of the resolvents @xmath57^{-1}$ ] and @xmath58^{-1}$ ] are diagonal in the corresponding wp bases and their elements have explicit analytical forms @xcite .",
    "different choices of weight functions lead to different sets of wps . in practical calculations in this work",
    "we use the momentum wave packets with the unit weight functions : @xmath59    it is easy to see that the overlap of such free momentum wp with a plane wave , i.e. the momentum representation of packet state ( [ ip ] ) itself has the form : @xmath60 where we have introduced a function @xmath61 which is equal to unity if the momentum @xmath40 belongs to the interval @xmath36 $ ] and vanishes in the other case .",
    "so , the wave packet @xmath62 takes a form of simple step - like function in the momentum representation .",
    "the sets of the constructed free wp states can be used to find two - body bound - states and also to solve a two - body scattering problem , e.g. for finding the two - body off - shell @xmath63-matrix @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will use these two - body @xmath8 bases to construct three - body wps for solution of the three - body scattering problem .",
    "three - body wave packet states are built as direct products of two - body ones .",
    "however , here one should take into account the spin and angular parts of the functions .",
    "the total three - body wp basis function can be written as : latexmath:[\\[\\label{xij }     the spin - angular state of the @xmath1 pair , @xmath65 is the spin - angular state of third nucleon , while @xmath66 is the set of the three - body quantum numbers .",
    "the state ( [ xij ] ) is a wp analog of the exact state of the three - body continuum @xmath67 for the free hamiltonian @xmath68 .",
    "the properties of such three - body wp s are very similar to those of two - body wave packets @xcite .",
    "in particular , the matrix of the three - body free hamiltonian @xmath68 and its resolvent @xmath69^{-1}$ ] are diagonal in the so constructed basis . in other words ,",
    "such a wp basis defines _ an `` eigen '' wave - packet subspace _ for the free three - body hamiltonian @xmath68 .",
    "since the basis functions are the products of both step - like functions in variables @xmath40 and @xmath42 , the solution of the three - body scattering problem in such a basis corresponds to a formulation of the scattering problem _ on a two - dimensional momentum lattice_. therefore we will refer to such a basis as a _ lattice basis_. let us denote the two - dimensional bins ( i.e. the lattice cells ) as @xmath70 . in the few - body case ,",
    "the lattice basis functions are constructed as direct products of the two - body free wps , so the basis space corresponds to a multi - dimensional lattice .    in principle , using the above lattice basis , one can solve a general three - body scattering problem by projecting all the scattering operators onto such a basis . in particular",
    ", the matrix of the three - body free resolvent @xmath71 can be expressed in the above lattice representation fully analytically @xcite .",
    "let us consider the particle permutation operator @xmath72 which enters in the faddeev equation for three identical particles and is defined as @xmath73    the matrix of the operator @xmath72 in the lattice basis corresponds to the overlap between basis functions defined in different jacobi sets : @xmath74 where the argument 1 ( or 2 ) in the basis functions means a corresponding jacobi set .",
    "such matrix element can be calculated with the definition of the basis functions in momentum space ( [ proj_rule ] ) : @xmath75_{ij , i'j'}^{{\\alpha}{\\beta},{\\alpha}'{\\beta}'}\\equiv\\langle x_{ij}^{\\gamma{\\alpha}{\\beta}}|p|x_{i'j'}^{\\gamma{\\alpha}'{\\beta}'}\\rangle=\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{perm}\\int_{{\\mathfrak{d}}_{ij}}dpdq\\int_{{\\mathfrak{d}}'_{i'j'}}dp'dq ' \\times\\frac{p^{\\gamma}_{{\\alpha}{\\beta},{\\alpha}'{\\beta}'}(p , q , p',q')}{\\sqrt{d_id_{i'}\\bar{d}_j\\bar{d}_{j'}}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime at the lattice cell @xmath76 indicates that the cell belongs to the other jacobi set while the @xmath77 is the kernel of particle permutation operator in a momentum space .",
    "this kernel , as is well known @xcite , is proportional to the product of the dirac delta and heaviside theta functions .",
    "however , due to `` packetting '' ( i.e integration over momentum bins in eq .",
    "( [ perm ] ) ) these singularities get averaged over the cells of the momentum lattice and , as a result , the elements of the permutation operator matrix in the wp basis are finite .    using the above `` packetting '' procedure and the hyperspherical momentum coordinates , the calculation of the matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ perm ] ) can be done using only a one - dimensional numerical integration over the hypermomentum @xmath78 .",
    "the technique of this calculation for the s - wave basis functions is given in appendix a of the present paper .",
    "the generalization for higher partial waves is straightforward .",
    "it should be emphasized here that the fixed lattice - like form for the permutation operator matrix makes it possible to avoid the complicated and time consuming multi - dimensional interpolations of the current solution when solving the faddeev equations ( in momentum space ) by iterations in conventional approach @xcite .",
    "such numerous multi - dimensional interpolations at each iteration step take a big portion of the computational time in practical numerical procedure .",
    "when solving the four - body yakubovsky equations the dimension for these interpolations increase and thus the computational efforts get even higher .",
    "so , avoiding the very numerous multidimensional interpolations in each step of the iterations leads to a tremendous acceleration for all three - body calculations in momentum space .",
    "thus , the two - dimensional momentum lattice basis constructed above can be applied directly to solving the faddeev equations for the conventional transition operator @xmath79 .",
    "however , by using the very convenient form for the spectral representation of the resolvent operators in the wp basis one can employ some alternative ( but equivalent ) form of the faddeev equation , which makes it possible to avoid the time - consuming calculation of the fully off - shell @xmath63-matrix at many energies ( which requires to solve very often the lippmann - schwinger equations at every energy and for different spin - orbit channels ) and to replace it by calculating the resolvent of the @xmath1 subhamiltonian @xmath18 in the corresponding _ scattering _ wp - representation .",
    "the latter can be made easily by straightforward one - fold diagonalization of the @xmath18 subhamiltonian matrix .      as has been demonstrated earlier @xcite the stationary wave packets",
    "can be built not only for free hamiltonians but also for perturbed two - body @xmath80 and three - body channel hamiltonians @xmath16 .    in case of the @xmath18 subhamiltonian ,",
    "its continua @xmath81 $ ] for every spin - angular configuration @xmath82 are divided into separate bins @xmath83_{k=1}^k\\}$ ] and one can build the scattering wave packet for every such bin @xmath84 $ ] in the form @xmath85 i.e. as an integral over the exact scattering wave function @xmath86 on the energy interval @xmath87 . here",
    "we use the unit weight function and @xmath88 is the width of interval @xmath87 .",
    "it is easy to show that such packet states have the same properties with respect to their `` eigen '' hamiltonian @xmath18 as free wps with respect to the free hamiltonian @xmath23 .",
    "the only difference is that the set of scattering wp s should be accomplished with the bound state functions of @xmath18 ( if they exist ) .",
    "jointly with the possible bound state wave functions for the @xmath18 subhamiltonian , the scattering wp s form an orthonormalized basis in which both the matrix of the hamiltonian @xmath18 and the matrix of its resolvent @xmath89^{-1}$ ] are diagonal @xcite .",
    "the projection properties for the wp of @xmath18 will be similar to those for @xmath23 ( [ proj_rule ] ) , viz .",
    ": @xmath90      at first glance it may appear that the exact scattering wp basis is useless because its construction would require the knowledge of exact scattering wave functions of the hamiltonian @xmath18 .",
    "however , as has been demonstrated @xcite , the properties of the exact scattering wp s for @xmath18 are quite similar to those of respective pseudostates obtained by the diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix in some complete @xmath8-basis .",
    "so that , in actual calculations one can replace the set of wp s @xmath91 by the set of respective pseudostates @xcite .",
    "such an @xmath8-basis can be used as a very good approximation for the free wp - basis ( [ ip ] ) . as a result of such hamiltonian matrix diagonalization ,",
    "one gets a set of pseudostates @xmath92 together with a set of their eigenvalues @xmath93 .    in this paper , we restrict ourselves to @xmath94-wave spin - dependent pair interactions only .",
    "we assume that there is a single bound state @xmath95 ( deuteron ) with binding energy @xmath96 in the @xmath1 spin - triplet channel and there are no bound states in the @xmath1 spin - singlet channel .    in case of @xmath94-wave scattering with @xmath94-wave",
    "@xmath1 interactions , the indices @xmath82 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 in eq .",
    "( [ xij ] ) include only the spin quantum numbers .",
    "so , below we will use the value of the spin of @xmath1-pair @xmath99 instead of index @xmath82 , while the index @xmath97 , which indicates the spin value of the third nucleon ( i.e. @xmath100 ) , will be omitted everywhere .",
    "the index @xmath98 defining the set of quantum numbers for three - body states is reduced to the total spin of the three - body system @xmath101 which in the @xmath94-wave case is equal to the total angular momentum of the system and therefore is conserved .",
    "after the above diagonalization in the spin - triplet channel ( @xmath102 ) one gets a set of pseudostate functions , the first of which @xmath103 with the energy @xmath96 , is an approximation for the deuteron wave function , while the other @xmath104 pseudostates with energies @xmath105 are localized in the continuum spectrum and correspond to scattering wp states for @xmath18 . in the spin - singlet channel",
    "there are no @xmath1 bound states , so that all functions @xmath106 in eq .",
    "( [ exp_z ] ) are approximated by scattering wp s .",
    "it is important to note that as a by - product of our diagonalization procedure one gets simultaneously the discrete representation for @xmath1 partial phase shifts @xmath107 for all pseudo - states energies ( i.e. in one step ! )  see the detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .    since the free wp basis functions ( in the momentum space ) are step - like functions , the momentum dependence of all functions expressed via such a basis have a histogram - like form .",
    "an example of the momentum dependence for the bound state ( deuteron ) function in such step - like basis in comparison with the exact function for yamaguchi triplet @xmath1 potential ( see appendix b ) is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ wpac ] displays the functions of two pseudostates ( with @xmath108 ) obtained in the lattice basis in comparison with the corresponding exact scattering wave packets which can be calculated exactly for the separable yamaguchi potential .",
    "it is interesting to see that although functions of the exact scattering wp s ( [ zi ] ) ( dashed lines in the figure ) have the logarithmic singularities at the boundaries of the `` on - shell '' interval ( i.e. the one which the state energy belongs to ) they are square - integrable as well as the free - motion wp s .",
    "it is clear from the comparison that the pseudostates composed from step - like wave packets reproduce very well the structure of the exact scattering wave packets `` on average '' .    now having at our disposal the two - body bases for subhamiltonians @xmath18 and @xmath25 one can construct the three - body wp basis for the channel hamiltonian @xmath16 which defines the asymptotic motion in the system .",
    "the three - body wp states corresponding to the channel hamiltonian @xmath16 can be defined similar as the wp - states for the three - body free hamiltonian @xmath68 , i.e. as direct products of two - body wp states for @xmath25 and @xmath18 subhamiltonians ( jointly with the bound - state ) multiplied by the spin functions of the system : @xmath109 are the @xmath1 subsystem and the total three - body spins correspondingly only . since in case of @xmath94-wave @xmath1 pairwise interaction the spin- and isospin quantum numbers are interrelated uniquely by the pauli principle we can omit further the isospin parts of the wave functions and corresponding quantum numbers . ] .",
    "when using the above pseudostate approximation , these three - body states , similarly to two - body scattering wps , are related to the three - body lattice basis states by a simple rotation transformation ( similar to eq .",
    "( [ exp_z ] ) ) : latexmath:[\\[\\label{rotation }    hence , starting from the free wp bases for every pair subsystem one gets a set of basis states both for the three - body free @xmath68 and the channel @xmath16 hamiltonians .",
    "the basis defined in eq .",
    "( [ si ] ) defines _ an `` eigen '' wp - subspace _ for the channel hamiltonian @xmath16 .",
    "this allows us to construct an analytical finite - dimensional approximation for the channel resolvent @xmath111^{-1}$ ] .",
    "indeed , the exact three - body channel resolvent is the convolution of the two - body subresolvents @xmath112 and @xmath113 : @xmath114 using further the spectral expansions for the two - body resolvents and integrating over @xmath115 , one gets an explicit expression for the channel resolvent @xmath116 as a sum of two terms @xmath117 . here",
    "the bound - continuum part @xmath118 is the spectral sum over the three - body states corresponding to the free motion of the deuteron relatively to the third nucleon .",
    "so , the imaginary part of @xmath118 is related to a discontinuity on the two - body cut of the riemann surface of the three - body energy @xmath119 .",
    "the continuum - continuum part @xmath120 of the channel resolvent includes the channel three - body states with the @xmath1 pair with interaction in the continuum and @xmath121 is defined by a discontinuity on the three - body cut on the energy surface ( see the details in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    projecting the exact channel resolvent onto the three - body channel wp basis defined in eq .",
    "( [ si ] ) , one can find analytical formulas for the matrix elements of the @xmath116 operator .",
    "the respective matrix is diagonal in all wave - packet and spin indices : @xmath122    here the diagonal matrix elements @xmath123 are defined as integrals over the respective momentum bins and depend in general on the spectrum partition parameters ( i.e. the @xmath124 and @xmath125 values ) and the total energy @xmath119 only .",
    "they do not depend explicitly on the interaction potential @xmath19 .",
    "if the solution of scattering equations in the finite - dimensional wp basis converges with increasing the basis dimension , the final result turns out to be _ independent _ on the particular spectral partition parameters .",
    "we have found @xcite the explicit formulas for the resolvent matrix elements ( [ dg1 ] ) when one uses the energy wp s , i.e. wp s with the weight functions @xmath126 , @xmath127 .",
    "the representation ( [ dg1 ] ) for the channel resolvent is the basic expression for our wave - packet approach , since it gives explicit analytical formulas for the three - body resolvent and thus it allows to simplify drastically the solution of general three - body scattering problem .",
    "this expression can be used directly to solve the finite - dimensional analog of the faddeev equations for the three components of the total scattering wave function  @xcite . alternatively the very convenient representation ( [ dg1 ] ) can also be used to solve some particular three - body scattering problems using the three - body lippmann ",
    "schwinger equations @xcite .",
    "now let us proceed with solving the @xmath2 elastic and breakup scattering problems .",
    "the elastic scattering observables can be found from the faddeev equation ( fe ) for the transition operator @xmath128 , e.g. in the form @xcite : @xmath129 where @xmath63 is two - body @xmath63-matrix in three - body space and @xmath72 is the particle permutation operator .",
    "the equivalent form of fe for the transition operator @xmath79 has the form : @xmath130 where @xmath116 is the resolvent of the channel hamiltonian @xmath16 . since @xmath131 the operators @xmath128 and @xmath79 coincide on - shell and half - shell .",
    "since the determination of the off - shell channel resolvent in three - body space is a rather time consuming solution of the fe in the form ( [ pvg ] ) , it is very seldom employed for practical solutions .",
    "actually a similar form of the equations is associated with formalisms of the configuration space faddeev equations , where quite different numerical approaches have been employed @xcite than for the momentum space fe . however , since in the lattice approach one has explicit analytical formulas for the three - body channel resolvent @xmath116 the form ( [ pvg ] ) of fe turns out to be very appropriate for the numerical solution in a wp basis .    the elastic @xmath2 scattering amplitude ( for a given value of total spin @xmath132 ) can be defined as matrix element of the solution of the eq .",
    "( [ pvg ] ) taken in the initial state @xmath133 : @xmath134    the breakup amplitude for one faddeev component of the three - body wave function ( the so - called single - component amplitude ) can be found from the elastic transition operator @xmath79 after applying the operator @xmath135 from the left : @xmath136 to obtain the differential breakup cross sections , the total breakup amplitudes can be found by the contributions of all three single - component amplitudes .",
    "thus , we change the conventional treatment of the breakup process @xcite and consider the three - body asymptotic states as scattering states for the channel hamiltonian @xmath16 rather than as the states of the three - body continuum for the free hamiltonian @xmath68 .",
    "it is a quite natural when treating the elastic scattering amplitudes because the initial state wave functions correspond to the channel hamiltonian @xmath16 . in full analogy with this",
    ", one can treat the deuteron breakup as its excitation into a continuum @xmath1-state in the two - body subsystem governed by the @xmath18 subhamiltonian . as was already indicated above such a treatment of breakup processes",
    "is close to the configuration space approach .",
    "in fact , when solving the three - body faddeev equations in the configuration space @xcite one finds the breakup amplitude @xmath137 which determines the asymptotic behavior of the three - body wave function in hyperspherical coordinates @xmath138 and @xmath139 as follows @xmath140{}\\frac{{\\cal   a}(\\theta)}{(k\\rho)^{5/2}},\\quad k=\\sqrt{p^2+{{\\frac{3}{4}}}q^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are two jacobi coordinates and @xmath143 is the hypermomentum .",
    "this breakup amplitude is defined for every spin - angular configuration and interrelated to the partial single - component breakup amplitudes ( [ abr ] ) by the following formula @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the hyperangle in momentum space .",

    "<S> a novel approach is developed to find the three - body breakup amplitudes and cross sections within the modified faddeev equation framework . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on the lattice - like discretization of the three - body continuum with a three - body stationary wave - packet basis in momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> the approach makes it possible to simplify drastically all the three- and few - body breakup calculations due to discrete wave - packet representations for the few - body continuum and simultaneous lattice representation for all the scattering operators entering the integral equation kernels . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the few - body breakup can be treated as a particular case of multi - channel scattering in which part of the channels represents the true few - body continuum states . as an illustration for the novel approach , </S>",
    "<S> an accurate calculations for the three - body breakup process @xmath0 with non - local and local @xmath1 interactions are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained reproduce nicely the benchmark calculation results using the traditional faddeev scheme which requires much more tedious and time - consuming calculations . </S>"
