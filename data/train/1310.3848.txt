    "there is a long tradition in the area of algebraic combinatorics of associating geometries or simplicial complexes to algebraic objects such as groups as a means of studying them . in group cohomology ,",
    "various combinatorial complexes associated to groups such as the quillen complex and the brown complex have proven very useful tools .",
    "( see @xcite , @xcite )    in this paper we explore such a construction which takes a finite nonabelian group @xmath4 and constructs a @xmath0-dimensional simplicial complex @xmath5 in a canonical manner from it .",
    "this complex turns out to have a nice geometric structure as a union of finitely many 2-dimensional pseudomanifolds which pairwise intersect in finitely many points .",
    "the pseudomanifolds are compact , connected and oriented and hence surfaces with at most singularities due to self - point - intersections , for example a sphere with 3 points identified or a torus with three meridian circles squashed to points . here",
    "the construction @xmath5 is canonical in the sense it is part of a covariant functor from the category of nonabelian finite groups to the category of compact , connected , oriented , 2-dimensional triangulated manifolds with  singularities \" of a type described precisely in section  [ sec : complex ] in detail .",
    "these singularities can be resolved in a functorial way to yield an associated complex @xmath6 which is a disjoint union of finitely many compact , connected , oriented , triangulated 2-manifolds ( we ll call these riemann surfaces in this paper for brevity at the expense of slight abuse of notation as we will not be using complex structure at all . )",
    "the manifolds in @xmath6 hence form a natural set of invariants for the group .",
    "more specifically the number of times the surface of genus @xmath7 occurs in @xmath6 is a natural invariant of the group which we study .",
    "furthermore the original complex @xmath5 can be shown to be homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of these manifolds with some circles due to the connections between them .",
    "additionally , the riemann surfaces arising via this functorial construction are equipped with interesting closed - cell structures naturally associated to their triangulations and indeed we show that a slight functorial modification of the triangulations of the components yield closed - cell structures where all faces consist of a given type of polygonal face .",
    "we show these satisfy the conditions of what is called an abstract 3-polytope in the combinatorics literature .",
    "any of these component polytopes is shown to have a face and edge transitive automorphism group and at most 2 orbits of vertices ( and hence two types of vertex valency ) .",
    "we identify group theoretic conditions for a component polytope to be equivar ( have a single valency ) and identify the schlfli symbol in this case .",
    "we also identify conditions for when the component forms a regular abstract 3-polytope such as a platonic solid . in this case",
    "the component can also be considered as a regular map , i.e. , a regular embedding of a graph in the underlying surface .",
    "for example this is the case when @xmath4 is the extraspecial @xmath8-group of order @xmath9 where @xmath8 is an odd prime which results in a regular tesselation of the surface of genus @xmath10 as the union of @xmath8 @xmath11-gons .",
    "constructions that yield such tesselations on riemann surfaces are not new .",
    "there are classical constructions using triangle or fuchsian groups , hyperbolic geometric tesselations of the poincare disk , cayley graphs or fundamental group arguments to construct similar objects ( see @xcite , @xcite for example ) .",
    "often a set of generators or specific presentation is chosen - our construction seems like an elementary variant , constructed in an algorithmic and functorial way from any nonabelian group .",
    "the initial construction uses the group itself in a very direct straightforward manner with no reference to specific presentation or external geometry - it clearly displays these tesselations as intrinsic to the group itself .    on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath5 and @xmath6 are determined functorially from @xmath4 , one can show that any automorphism of @xmath4 determines an orientation preserving , simplicial automorphism of @xmath5 .",
    "these simplicial automorphisms can permute the surface ",
    "components \" of @xmath6 but must preserve the genus and indeed the tessellation type .",
    "thus , one can use this construction to find faithful actions of subquotients of @xmath12 on various surfaces and hence obtain embeddings of these subquotients into the group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath13 , the surface of genus @xmath7 . in the second paper @xcite",
    ", we explore some examples of orientation preserving group actions afforded by this construction and some corresponding embeddings into mapping class groups .",
    "we also discuss some examples pertaining to the strong symmetric genus ( see @xcite , @xcite ) of the group , i.e. the smallest genus orientable closed surface for which the group acts on faithfully via orientation preserving diffeomorphisms .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "we attempt to quantify the number and type of surface components that occur in the decomposition @xmath6 for a given group @xmath4 .",
    "for example when @xmath4 is the alternating group on @xmath14 letters , the construction @xmath6 discussed in this paper results in @xmath15 surface components of @xmath16 distinct genus , with even more distinct cell - structures .",
    "tables summarizing the various polytopes that occur in @xmath6 for various groups @xmath4 can be found in the appendix of @xcite .    finally in @xcite",
    ", we show that extensions of groups yield branched coverings between their constituent surfaces in their decompositions .",
    "let @xmath4 be a finite nonabelian group and let @xmath17 be its center .",
    "we will now describe the construction of @xmath5 in detail - the reader is encouraged to draw pictures to help with the definitions in this section as at first they seem elaborate though with some study , the nice structure of the complex will emerge .",
    "we will use some basic notation from the world of simplicial complexes - for a good reference on the terminology , see @xcite .    before we construct the simplicial complex @xmath5",
    ", we construct an associated subgraph @xmath18 .",
    "the vertices of the graph @xmath19 are given by the noncentral elements of @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath20 and are labelled as type 1 vertices , thus a typical vertex is labelled @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "we declare @xmath23 $ ] to be an edge in the simplicial graph @xmath19 if and only if @xmath24 and @xmath25 do not commute in @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "this graph is the 1-skeleton of the simply connected complex @xmath27 considered in @xcite and hence is path connected but we provide a simple proof of this here :    @xmath18 is a path connected graph .",
    "let @xmath28 be two vertices in @xmath19 . then @xmath29 are not central in @xmath4 so their centralizer subgroups @xmath30 and @xmath31 are proper subgroups of @xmath4 and hence have at most half the elements of @xmath4 in them .",
    "thus @xmath32 as @xmath33 each have at most half the elements of @xmath4 in them and they have the identity element in common",
    ". thus there must exist @xmath34 which means there is a path of length two from @xmath21 to @xmath35 in @xmath19 through @xmath36 as @xmath37 does not commute with either @xmath24 or @xmath25 . since @xmath28 were arbitrary vertices of the graph @xmath19 , we conclude that @xmath19 is path connected .",
    "we now extend the graph @xmath19 to get the simplicial complex @xmath5 .",
    "first we include a second set of vertices @xmath38 which also consists of the noncentral elements of @xmath4 but with label 2 , written as @xmath39 , for @xmath22 .",
    "thus the vertex set of @xmath5 consists of the disjoint union of @xmath40 and @xmath38 i.e. two copies of the non central elements of @xmath4 . to describe a simplicial complex ,",
    "it is enough to describe its maximal faces .",
    "the maximal faces of @xmath5 are of the form @xmath41 $ ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 do not commute - we orient these @xmath0-simplices in the order indicated also .",
    "note that the three vertices @xmath42 of this face pairwise do not commute in @xmath4 .",
    "notice every edge in the graph @xmath19 lies in two distinct faces of @xmath5 i.e. , + @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "also note that the orientations on these two faces cancel along this edge .",
    "furthermore if @xmath45 is a noncentral element , there must be an element @xmath24 which does not commute with it by definition .",
    "then @xmath46 does not commute with @xmath24 and @xmath47 $ ] is a face of @xmath5 .",
    "thus every type 2 vertex does lie in a face also .",
    "notice from this argument that for any @xmath48 which do not commute , the edge @xmath49 $ ] is part of the complex .",
    "furthermore such an edge lies again in exactly two faces @xmath50 $ ] and @xmath51 $ ] whose orientations cancel along that edge .",
    "[ fig : 2face ]    to summarize , we have defined a @xmath0-dimensional simplicial complex @xmath5 whose vertex set @xmath52 is the disjoint union of @xmath40 and @xmath38 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 and whose edges are of the form @xmath23 $ ] and @xmath55 $ ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 do not commute .",
    "finally the ( oriented ) faces in the complex are of the form @xmath56 $ ] and every edge lies in exactly two faces whose orientations cancel along that edge .",
    "note in particular every face of @xmath5 shares an edge with the graph @xmath19 considered earlier .",
    "finally note that @xmath5 is path - connected as any point in @xmath5 lies in a face and any point in a face can be connected by a straight line path to a point on the graph @xmath19 . as we have seen",
    "that the graph @xmath19 is path - connected , it follows that any two points in @xmath5 are connected by a path .",
    "we summarize the properties of @xmath5 here that will be relevant to the rest of the analysis of this complex in this section .",
    "we postpone the proof of the functoriality of this construction till later .",
    "[ basic properties ] let @xmath4 be a finite nonabelian group and @xmath17 be its center .",

    "+ ( 2 ) the faces can be oriented so that along any edge , the two orientations of the adjacent faces cancel .",
    "+ ( 3 ) it is path - connected , thus in particular every vertex lies in an edge .",
    "we will now show that any simplicial complex that satisfies the criteria of proposition  [ basic properties ] like @xmath5 does is a union of finitely many compact , connected , oriented , pseudomanifolds who pairwise intersect in a finite collection of vertices .",
    "recall ( see @xcite ) that an @xmath57-dimensional pseudomanifold is a @xmath57-dimensional simplicial complex @xmath58 which satisfies : + ( 1 ) @xmath58 is the union of its @xmath57-simplices .",

    "+ furthermore a pseudomanifold is orientable if one can orient all the @xmath57-simplices in such a way that for any @xmath59 simplex @xmath66 in @xmath58 , the two orientations from the two adjacent @xmath57-simplices cancel along @xmath66 .",
    "+ note that conditions ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) imply that all pseudomanifolds are path - connected . + it is well known that every path connected , triangulated topological @xmath57-manifold is a @xmath57-dimensional pseudomanifold .",
    "however pseudomanifolds also allow certain types of singularites which we will talk about below .",
    "let @xmath58 be a simplicial complex satisfying the conditions of proposition  [ basic properties ] such as @xmath5 .",
    "define an equivalence relation on the @xmath0-faces of @xmath58 by saying @xmath67 and @xmath68 are equivalent if there is a sequence of @xmath0-faces @xmath61 such that @xmath62 and @xmath63 share a common edge for @xmath65 .",
    "the union of faces in an equivalence class then gives an oriented compact @xmath0-dimensional pseudomanifold .",
    "furthermore @xmath58 has finitely many equivalence classes and so is a union of finitely many oriented , compact , pseudomanifolds any two of which can meet only in a finite set of vertices .",
    "as every vertex of @xmath58 lies in an edge and every edge lies in a face ( @xmath0-simplex ) , it is clear that @xmath58 is the union of its @xmath0-simplices .",
    "the relation described on these faces is easily checked to be an equivalence relation and the equivalence classes partition the @xmath0-simplices of @xmath58 . as every edge of @xmath58 lies in exactly two faces and faces can be oriented so that orientations cancel along the edges in common , it is clear that the union of the @xmath0-simplices in one of the equivalence classes forms a @xmath0-dimensional oriented pseudomanifold .",
    "it consists of finitely many simplices and is compact as @xmath58 is .",

    "if @xmath69 and @xmath70 are two of these , the intersection @xmath71 is a subcomplex .",
    "if this complex contained any edge , it would bound two faces , one of which has to be in @xmath69 and one which has to be in @xmath70 , and these faces would be equivalent contradicting the construction of the pseudomanifolds @xmath69 and @xmath70 as unions from distinct equivalence classes of faces . thus the intersection contains no edges and hence no faces and so consists of at most a finite collection of vertices as claimed .",
    "note from the proof above , it is clear that the pseudomanifolds whose union is @xmath5 can be algorithmically determined and hence are unique .",
    "we will call them the pseudomanifold components of @xmath5 .",
    "the following three examples are examples of simplicial complexes satisfying the hypothesis of proposition  [ basic properties ] and give a good indication of the type of spaces that can be @xmath5 : + ( 1 ) a compact , connected , oriented , triangulated @xmath0-manifold . here",

    "a sphere with 3 points identified to a single point .",
    "this can be triangulated so that it is a compact , oriented pseudomanifold and is a typical example of such .",
    "every compact , oriented 2-dimensional pseudomanifold can be obtained from a triangulated riemann surface by a finite number of vertex identifications .",
    "we will see this soon as a byproduct of other analysis .",
    "thus basically in dimension @xmath0 an oriented compact pseudomanifold is nearly an oriented compact connected manifold aside from some point self - intersections .",
    "+ ( 3 ) take a torus and squash three meridian circles to three distinct points .",
    "this space can be triangulated so that it satisfies the hypothesis of proposition  [ basic properties ] .",
    "it has three pseudomanifold components which are spheres and any two of these pseudomanifold components intersect in a single vertex but no point lies in all three pseudomanifold components .",
    "+ let @xmath58 be any simplicial complex satisfying the conditions of proposition  [ basic properties ] .",
    "notice that if @xmath24 is a point in the interior of a face ( 2-simplex ) then it is clear it has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to the unit open ball of @xmath72 .",
    "if @xmath24 is a point on an edge other than its two end points , then as every edge lies in exactly two faces , it is again clear that @xmath24 has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to the unit open ball of @xmath72 .",
    "thus the only points of @xmath58 that might not have open neighborhoods homeomorphic to open subsets of @xmath72 are the vertices .",
    "in particular @xmath73 is a @xmath0-dimensional oriented topological manifold whose connected components , we will see later , are punctured riemann surfaces .",
    "the next proposition shows that the connected components of @xmath74 are in natural bijective correspondence with the pseudomanifold components of @xmath58 .",
    "[ pro : components ] let @xmath58 be a simplicial complex satisfying the conditions of proposition  [ basic properties ] and let @xmath75 be given the subspace topology .",

    "as @xmath58 was the union of its pseudomanifold components @xmath78 which pairwise intersected in at most finitely many vertex points , we see that @xmath69 is the disjoint union of @xmath79 where @xmath52 is the vertex set of @xmath58 . as each @xmath80",
    "is closed in @xmath58 , each @xmath81 is closed in @xmath82 and hence also open as there are a finite number of pseudomanifold components .",
