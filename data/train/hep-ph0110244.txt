    "the reheating period in the early universe stands out as a challenge to theorists due to the close interrelationship of nonlinear and gravitational phenomena in its unfolding ( see @xcite , henceforth ",
    "papers 1 - 5  ) .",
    "the observation that , due to the high occupation numbers produced during preheating , most of the physics of reheating may be understood in terms of the behavior of nonlinear classical waves@xcite has been the key to sustantial progress .",
    "the authors of papers 1 - 5 have undertaken systematic numerical simulations of the behavior of matter fields during reheating , finding that the reheating period is actually composed of three consecutive phases : an early one or preheating , where the dominant effect is the parametric amplification of matter fields out of the dynamical inflaton and gravitational backgrounds @xcite , an intermediate stage where the dominant phenomenon is the redistribution of energy among matter field modes through rescattering ( in the terminology of papers 1 - 5 ) , and a final stage where thermal equilibrium sets in . during the intermediate stage ,",
    "spectra of occupation numbers for the matter fields reduce to simple power laws both in the infrared and ultraviolet limits .",
    "as noted in papers 1 - 5 , this behavior suggests a connection between the physics of reheating and the phenomena of weak turbulence @xcite , but to the best of our knowledge no theoretical prediction for the exponents involved is available .",
    "our goal is to provide these theoretical estimates .    in this paper",
    "we shall follow this same trend of ideas , by observing that , from the macroscopic point of view , a stochastic ensemble of classical waves may be described by a conserved energy momentum tensor subject to the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "there is therefore an equivalent fluid description , consisting of a fluid whose energy momentum tensor and equation of state reproduce the observed ones for the microscopic fluctuations . solving the dynamics of this equivalent fluid yields answers to all relevant questions concerning the behavior of the actual fluctuations .",
    "an immediate consequence of energy momentum conservation and the second law is that when velocities are low , the phenomenological fluid may be described within the eckart theory of dissipative fluids @xcite ( for an analysis of the limitations of eckart s theory see @xcite ) .",
    "it follows that it obeys a continuity equation and a curved space time navier - stokes one .",
    "turbulent  spectra found in numerical simulations correspond to the self - similar solutions discussed long ago by chandrasekhar @xcite .",
    "they appear in the discussion of decaying turbulence ( which is the case relevant to cosmology ) , as opposed to turbulence driven by some external means .",
    "the chandrasekhar solutions are built on the heisenberg closure hypothesis @xcite ( see @xcite for a general discussion of turbulence ) .",
    "they were generalized to friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) backgrounds by tomita _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "these solutions agree with the kolmogorov 1941 theory in the inertial range @xcite , failing to reproduce observations for very small eddies .",
    "fortunately , we are most interested in the opposite limit of very large eddies , where it is trustworthy ( we wish to point out that the applicability of kolmogorov s spectrum to large scale turbulence should not be taken for granted @xcite ) . with minor adjustments ,",
    "tomita s analysis of turbulence decay in frw space times also provides a solution to the evolution of our equivalent fluid .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we provide a brief summary of hydrodynamics in flat and expanding universes , in order to set up the language for the rest of the paper , and introduce the self similar solutions .",
    "in section iii we proceed to discuss the equivalent fluid description of field fluctuations , and how to extract the particle spectrum therefrom . in section",
    "iv we place the self - similar solutions in the context of reheating .",
    "we state our main conclusions in the final section .",
    "we provide a rough estimate of the shear viscosity during reheating in the appendix .",
    "the equations governing the dynamics of a fluid in local thermodynamic equilibrium are the continuity and navier - stokes ones , which , in the case of flat space time , read :    @xmath3    @xmath4    where we have assumed incompressibility , valid when typical velocities are much smaller than the sound velocity ; @xmath5 is the kinematic shear viscosity .",
    "the transition from laminar to turbulent motion can be universally described by the dimensionless  reynolds ",
    "number :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is a typical velocity and @xmath8 a typical length scale .",
    "this number represents the order of magnitude of the ratio of the inertial to the viscous term .",
    "low reynolds numbers correspond to laminar motion , while high ones suggest turbulent behavior .",
    "in general , the velocity profile displays variations in space and time .",
    "this implies that the flow must be described probabilistically .",
    "thus , each quantity involved in ( [ contpl]-[nspl ] ) is divided in its mean value and a fluctuation from it ; for example , we write @xmath9 , where @xmath10 stands for the fluctuating part of the velocity . in the case where motion is isotropic ,",
    "the mean value @xmath11 for the velocity must be zero , since otherwise there would be a preferred direction .    to analyze the system s behavior",
    ", we define the two - point one - time correlation function for the velocity :    @xmath12    in the case of homogeneous and isotropic motion , this correlation must be only a function of the time @xmath13 and the distance between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16 , where @xmath17 observe that @xmath18 ( summation over repeated indices must be understood ) is twice the average energy density of the flow at time @xmath13 . from ( [ nspl ] )",
    "we obtain the equation that this correlation must obey , namely :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and    @xmath21    the tensor @xmath22 comes form the inertia term in navier - stokes equation and , as it involves a product of third order in the velocity , reflects the fact that there is not a close set of equation for the correlations of successive orders but there is a hierarchy of equations instead .",
    "the problem of closing that hierarchy is known as the  moment closure problem  @xcite .",
    "let us call @xmath23 the fourier transform of @xmath24 .",
    "then the energy density becomes    @xmath25 where    @xmath26    is the energy density stored in eddies of size @xmath27 defining @xmath28 as the fourier transform of @xmath22 , we obtain from ( [ ecrij ] ) the equation of balance of the energy spectrum : @xmath29 where @xmath30    the inertia term @xmath31 is the one that contains the mode - mode interaction , and its effect is to drain energy form the more energetic modes -typically the bigger ones- to the ones where there is major viscous dissipation -the smaller ones- .      for a curved space - time , in particular a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe with zero spatial curvature ( @xmath32 ) , the generalization of the above arguments has been considered by many authors @xcite .",

    "the symmetries of the frw solution suggest using instead the commoving three velocity @xmath35 if @xmath36 the flow is non relativistic , and if @xmath37 it is incompressible ( @xmath38 ) .",

    "the corresponding navier - stokes equation reads : @xmath45 { \\bf v=-}\\frac{\\nabla p}{a\\left ( p+\\rho \\right ) } + \\frac 1{a^2}\\nu \\nabla ^2{\\bf v }   \\label{nscurv}\\ ] ] in obtaining ( [ contcur])-([nscurv ] ) we have neglected possible perturbations to the frw metric .",
    "the corresponding equations considering fluctuations in the metric ( @xmath46 ) have been obtained by weinberg @xcite .",
    "the continuity equation is not corrected by gravitational perturbations , while in the navier - stokes equation the metric fluctuations appear explicitly only within the shear viscosity term .",
    "it can be demonstrated that these terms involving metric fluctuations are negligible for scales that are inside the horizon @xcite . for scales bigger than the hubble radius ,",
    "since dissipation through viscosity is not effective anyway , we may still use the unperturbed navier - stokes equation .",
    "the operation of fourier transforming in the case of a robertson - walker cosmology is done in terms of commoving wave - numbers . in doing so",
    ", the following equation for the energy spectrum is obtained : @xmath47 where the relationship between @xmath48 and @xmath23 as well as between @xmath31 and @xmath49 is the same as that for a flat space time , if we define @xmath50 and @xmath22 from correlations of physical quantities , as follows : @xmath51      as we have seen in the previous section , the key element in the description of the flow is the energy spectrum @xmath52 ( eq.([et ] ) ) , which is the solution of the balance equation ( eq.([ecesp ] ) ) . in it ,",
    "the right hand side contains the viscous dissipation as well as the inertial force @xmath53 .",
    "the overall effect of this term is to transfer energy from a given scale to smaller ones through mode - mode coupling ; thus it is natural to model the action of the inertia term as a source of viscous dissipation , where the effective turbulent viscosity for a given mode depends on the motion of all smaller eddies @xcite . by providing closure ,",
