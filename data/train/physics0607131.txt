    "in the large scale region of wealth , income , profits , assets , sales , the number of employees and etc ( @xmath5 ) , the cumulative probability distribution @xmath6 obeys a power - law : @xmath7 this power - law and the exponent @xmath8 are called pareto s law and pareto index , respectively  @xcite .",
    "recently , fujiwara et al .",
    "@xcite have explained pareto s law ( and the reflection law ) by using the law of detailed balance and gibrat s law  @xcite , which are also observed in empirical data .",
    "the detailed balance is time - reversal symmetry observed in a relatively stable economy : @xmath9 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are two successive incomes , profits , assets , sales , etc . and @xmath10 is a joint probability distribution function ( pdf ) . on the other hand ,",
    "gibrat s law is valid in the large scale region where the conditional probability distribution of growth rate @xmath11 is independent of the initial value @xmath1 : @xmath12 here growth rate @xmath13 is defined as the ratio @xmath14 and @xmath11 is defined by using the pdf @xmath15 and the joint pdf @xmath16 as @xmath17  . in the proof ,",
    "fujiwara et al . assume no model and only use these two underlying laws in empirical data . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is reported that the pareto index is also induced from the reflection law .",
    "these findings are important for the progress of econophysics .",
    "above derivations are , however , valid only in the economic equilibrium where the detailed balance ( [ detailed balance ] ) holds . in order to discuss the transition ,",
    "the dynamics should be established by investigating long - term economic data in which dynamical transitions are observed .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to obtain personal income or company size data for a long period .    in this study , we investigate the dynamical behavior in the large scale region of non - equilibrium systems , by employing data on the assessed value of land in 1983  2006 japan . because the distribution of japanese land prices has similar features with one of personal income and company size  @xcite , and the long - term database is readily available  @xcite .    in the non - equilibrium system",
    "we find the detailed quasi - balance , which has the symmetry : @xmath0 . by using the detailed quasi - balance and gibrat s law",
    ", we derive pareto s law with varying pareto index annually .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 corresponds with the ratio of pareto indices @xmath4 , and the relation is confirmed in the empirical data nicely  @xcite .",
    "in japan , land is a very important asset and land prices change annually in a 24-period ( 1983  2006 ) .",
    "this period contains bubble term ( 1986  1991 ) caused by the abnormal rise of land prices .",
    "the economy correlates with land prices .",
    "we employ the database of the assessed value of land , which indicates the standard land prices , covering the 24-year period from 1983 to 2006 .",
    "the cumulative probability distributions of land prices are shown in fig .",
    "[ prebubbledistribution ]  [ quasistaticdistribution ] . from fig .",
    "[ prebubbledistribution ]  [ quasistaticdistribution ] , the power - law is confirmed in the large scale region . for each year",
    ", we estimate pareto index @xmath8 in the range of land prices from @xmath18 to @xmath19 where pareto s law holds approximately . annual change of pareto index @xmath8 from 1983 to 2006 is represented in fig .",
    "[ varyingparetoindex ] . in this period ,",
    "pareto index has changed annually .",
    "this means that the system is not in equilibrium and the detailed balance ( [ detailed balance ] ) does not hold .",
    "actually , the breakdown in the large scale region is observed in the scatter plot of all pieces of land assessed in the database ( fig .",
    "[ 95vs96 ] for instance ) .",
    "there is no @xmath20 symmetry in fig .",
    "[ 95vs96 ] obviously . on the other hand ,",
    "the detailed balance ( @xmath20 symmetry ) in the large scale region is observed approximately in fig .",
    "[ 02vs03 ] for instance .    from fig .",
    "[ 95vs96 ]  [ 02vs03 ] , we make a simple assumption that the symmetry of the joint pdf @xmath10 is represented as a regression line fitted by least - square method as follows @xmath21 in this form , the detailed balance ( [ detailed balance ] ) has the special symmetry , @xmath22 . for each scatter plot , we measure @xmath3 , @xmath23 in the same range where pareto index @xmath8 is estimated and the result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ dqb ] .    from this symmetry ( @xmath24 ) , we extend the detailed balance ( [ detailed balance ] ) to @xmath25 we call this law the detailed quasi - balance .",
    "in this section , we derive pareto s law with varying pareto index by using the detailed quasi - balance ( [ detailed quasi - balance ] ) . in the proof ,",
    "we assume gibrat s law ( [ gibrat ] ) in the large scale region , because the number of data points is insufficient to observe gibrat s law .    due to the relation of @xmath26 under the change of variables from @xmath27 to @xmath28 ,",
    "these two joint pdfs are related to each other @xmath29 where we use a modified ratio @xmath30 . from this relation ,",
    "the detailed quasi - balance ( [ detailed quasi - balance ] ) is rewritten in terms of @xmath16 as follows : @xmath31 substituting the joint pdf @xmath16 for the conditional probability @xmath11 , the detailed quasi - balance is expressed as @xmath32    by expanding eq .",
    "( [ dqb and gibrat ] ) around @xmath33 , the following differential equation is obtained @xmath34 the solution is given by @xmath35 here we consider two cumulative probability distributions @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which lead @xmath38 from eq .",
    "( [ handm ] ) , ( [ pareto0 ] ) and ( [ pareto2 ] ) , the relation between @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath3 is expressed as @xmath41    this is an equation between detailed quasi - balance and pareto s law in the non - equilibrium dynamical system .",
    "we confirm that the empirical data satisfy this correlation in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] .",
    "in this study , we have investigated the dynamical behavior of non - equilibrium system in the large scale region by employing data on the assessed value of land in 1983  2006 japan .",
    "we have identified the detailed quasi - balance ( [ detailed quasi - balance ] ) in the database , and have derived pareto s law with varying pareto index by assuming gibrat s law ( [ gibrat ] ) . as a result , we have obtained a relation between the change of pareto index @xmath8 and the parameter @xmath3 in the detailed quasi - balance . the relation ( [ ratio2 ] )",
    "has been confirmed in the empirical data nicely .",
    "what does the other parameter @xmath23 mean ? because we demand detailed quasi - balance in the system , the area above the regression line ( [ line ] ) equals the area below it .",
    "the two parameters @xmath3 and @xmath23 are , therefore , related to each other .",
    "the relation is expressed as @xmath42 here @xmath43 is sufficient large number compared with the upper bound ( @xmath44 ) where @xmath3 and @xmath23 are estimated .",
    "this is the reason why the two parameters @xmath3 and @xmath23 vary in opposite direction in fig .",
    "[ dqb ] . the relation ( [ gamma ] )",
    "is confirmed directly in fig .",
    "[ ratio0 ] where we set @xmath45 to be 10 .",
    "consequently , the detailed quasi - balance has one parameter in principle .",
    "we should comment on several separations between @xmath3 and @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] .",
    "an abrupt jump of pareto index between 1984 and 1986 ( 2001 and 2002 ) is observed in fig .",
    "[ varyingparetoindex ] .",
    "this means that the system changes vigorously in this period , where the symmetry is not represented as the regression line ( [ line ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the dynamical equation ( [ ratio2 ] ) is valid in almost all the other quasistatic periods .    for the next step , we should investigate the dynamical behavior in the middle scale region . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is reported that pareto index @xmath8 changes annually whereas the distributions in the middle region are stationary in time by analyzing income data for 1983  2001 usa .",
    "this phenomenon is explained by the fokker - planck equation  @xcite under two assumptions with respect to the change of income .",
    "the middle scale distributions of land prices , however , are not stationary",
    ". the distributions do not collapse onto a single curve by the normalization of the average land price .",
    "this difference is thought to be caused by the difference between the trend of increasing ( decreasing ) income and the trend of increasing ( decreasing ) land price . in order to study the dynamical behavior in the middle scale region",
    ", we must identify each peculiar feature of middle scale distributions in the database  @xcite .",
