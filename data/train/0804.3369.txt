    "although they are the dominant radio source population in the sky at low radio frequencies , steep - spectrum extragalactic radio sources ( radio galaxies and lobe - dominated radio - loud quasars ) have been relatively poorly studied at millimetre wavelengths ( corresponding to frequencies @xmath0 ghz ) , although a good deal of work has been done on integrated flux density measurements of their flat - spectrum , jet - dominated counterparts ( e.g.  edelson 1987 ) . where information on steep - spectrum radio sources at mm wavelengths is available in the literature ( e.g.  steppe et al .",
    "1988 , 1995 ) it tends to be restricted to tables of integrated flux densities .",
    "this is presumably partly due to the intrinsic difficulty of mm - wave observations compared to those at 110 ghz , partly because the steep spectrum of most components of radio galaxies makes them harder to detect at higher frequencies , and partly because of a perception that there is little additional information to be gained at high frequencies .",
    "high - frequency imaging observations of radio galaxies and quasars can have some astrophysical importance , however .",
    "in early work on the spectrum of the large - scale radio emission from powerful radio galaxies ( friis , fanaroff & riley 1974 ) , it was found that their spectra , measured at centimetre wavelengths , systematically steepen with distance from the hotspots , inferred to be the sites of particle acceleration at each end of the source ( e.g. myers & spangler 1985 , alexander & leahy 1987 ) .",
    "the steepening was interpreted as evidence for ` synchrotron ageing ' , whereby the synchrotron energy loss process depletes high - energy electrons in the source ( e.g. pacholczyk 1970 , jaffe & perola 1973 , leahy 1991 ) .",
    "if observations of spectral steepening in friis are really a result of synchrotron ageing , then in principle resolved images of the radio spectra allow us to measure plasma age as a function of position in the source , which in turn allows the determination of quantities like total source age and expansion speed .",
    "however , the interpretation of the spectral steepening in friis in terms of synchrotron ageing has been questioned more recently .",
    "most dramatically , katz - stone , rudnick & anderson ( 1993 ) showed that the detailed centimetre - wave spectrum of the extended ` lobe ' emission in the powerful frii source cygnus a ( 3c405 ) is not consistent with any conventional ageing model , arguing instead that the observations are consistent with a single , curved electron energy spectrum seen in a varying magnetic field ; this would imply that ageing is in fact a negligible effect in the lobes . introducing inhomogeneities into",
    "the field strength or electron population also seems likely to undermine ` traditional ' spectral ageing .",
    "rudnick ( 1999 ) gives a summary of the theoretical and observational problems faced by ageing models .",
    "one important constraint on all models would be observations at wavelengths shorter than the centimetre wavelengths typically used in observations of radio galaxies .",
    "the effects of ageing become greater as we go to shorter wavelengths ; in particular , there should be a very strong difference between the short - wavelength spectra of regions near and far from the hotspots in the standard picture .",
    "however , only a few powerful radio galaxies have been imaged at these short wavelengths .",
    "cygnus a , the brightest such object in the sky , has been observed with the berkeley illinois maryland association millimetre - wave interferometer ( bima ) on several occasions ( wright & birkinshaw 1984 , wright & sault 1993 ) and with the iram 30-m telescope at 230 ghz ( salter et al.1989 ) .",
    "wright & sault ( 1993 ) commented briefly on the global spectrum of the lobes of cygnus a at @xmath1 ghz , but their result does not tell us anything about the _ variation _ of the centimetre - to - millimetre spectrum of the source as a function of position .",
    "more recently , we used bima to observe the radio galaxies 3c123 and 3c20 ( looney & hardcastle 2000 , hardcastle & looney 2001 ) at similar frequencies .",
    "we noted that the integrated spectrum of a part of the northern lobe of 3c123 was inconsistent with an ageing model , leading us to suggest that particle acceleration might be ongoing in that region .",
    "an upper limit on the flux density of the southern lobe was consistent with ageing models , however . in 3c20 , the centimetre - to - millimetre spectrum of a part of the eastern lobe was very consistent with spectral ageing models , in contrast to the results of katz - stone et al .     in this paper",
    "we combine the results of this and other earlier work with new observations of a small sample of frii radio sources using bima , taken in configurations intended to allow us to separate lobes from core , jet and hotspot emission .",
    "when combined with observations with the nrao very large array ( vla ) and the multi - element radio linked interferometer network ( merlin ) the resulting database of objects allows us to make some general statements about the high - frequency spectral properties of components of friis and about the viability of standard spectral ageing models .",
    "we also comment on the prospects for observations of radio galaxies with the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "j2000.0 co - ordinates are used throughout , and spectral index @xmath2 is defined in the sense @xmath3 .",
    "resolutions quoted are the major @xmath4 minor fwhm of elliptical restoring gaussians ( the gaussian is circular if only one number is quoted ) and the position angles quoted are the angle between the major axis and north , defined in the sense that positive angles indicate a rotation eastwards .",
    "our aim in making new observations was to detect the lobe - related emission seen in our observations of 3c123 and 3c20 .",
    "accordingly , we selected for observation frii radio sources with high surface brightness , so as to maximize the prospects of detecting the comparatively low - surface - brightness lobes with bima .",
    "we chose our targets from the 3crr sample ( laing , riley & longair 1983 ) .",
    "after excluding compact - steep - spectrum sources , which bima can not image usefully given their small angular size , and core - dominated objects , we obtained the sample listed in table [ sample ] .",
    "the two sources we had previously observed , 3c20 and 3c123 , would also have been selected from 3crr by these criteria .",
    "3c405 , our final object , is excluded from 3crr because of its low galactic latitude , but is of course of very high surface brightness at low frequency .",
    "data for 3c405 , the b- and c - array components of the mosaiced observations discussed by wright , chernin & forster ( 1997 ) , were kindly supplied by mel wright .",
    ".the surface - brightness - selected sample of frii radio sources [ cols= \" < , < , > , > , > \" , ]     upper limits are @xmath5 limits based on the off - source noise .",

    "2002 ) .",
    "it is very clear that hotspots , cores and ( where present ) jets dominate the high - frequency radio emission from these sources .",
    "nevertheless some sources show clear emission from lobe regions .",
    "these are 3c20 and 3c123 ( as described in our earlier papers ) , 3c405 ( where a spur of emission leading n and w from the e hotspot is seen ) and 3c388 ( where the w hotspot is extended to the se ) . in all four of these cases the ` lobe ' emission at mm wavelengths",
    "is well matched morphologically to high - surface - brightness features close to the hotspot at cm wavelengths .",
    "as noted above , extended emission in 3c388 e , 3c401 and 3c438 can not unambiguously be associated with either the lobes or the hotspots , but it is plausible that some or all of this emission is also related to the lobes .",
    "no lobe - related emission is seen in 3c220.1 or 3c295 , though of course these are the highest - redshift sources in our sample with observing frequencies corresponding to @xmath7 ghz in the source frame .    in fig .",
    "[ spix ] we show maps of spectral index between 8.4 and 90 ghz for the four small sources with detected emission that might be lobe - related .",
    "3c20 ( as already discussed in hardcastle & looney 2001 ) and 3c388 show clear spectral steepening away from the hotspots . in 3c401 and 3c438",
    "the flattest - spectrum regions are the jets ( already discussed above ) and there is no clear evidence for resolved spectral steepening in the lobes .",
    "we concentrate initially on the sources with clear detections of lobe - related emission at 90 ghz : 3c20 , 3c123 , 3c388 and 3c405 .",
    "the spectra of the lobes of the first two is discussed in our earlier papers : we measured flux densities in matched regions defined using the 90-ghz maps for 3c388 and 3c405 . in all of these sources",
    "we find that the spectral index between cm wavelengths ( 5 or 8 ghz ) and 90 ghz is steeper in the extended emission than in the corresponding hotspot , which is qualitatively consistent with expectations from spectral ageing models .",
    "however , if there is any curvature in the hotspot spectra ( as there is in the spectra of the 3c123 and 3c405 hotspots ) then a simple decrease in the magnetic field strength and electron energy , as expected if plasma expands adiabatically on leaving the hotspots , would also produce such a result .",
    "as discussed in section [ intro ] , we showed in the case of the peculiar object 3c123 that the spectrum of the detected northern lobe region is inconsistent with a jaffe & perola ( 1973 ; hereafter j - p ) spectral ageing model , perhaps a result of particle reacceleration in the lobe .",
    "by contrast the spectrum of the 3c20 e lobe is well fitted with a j - p model provided that the ` injection index ' ( the low - frequency spectral index ) is tuned to allow a good fit to the low - frequency data . in 3c388 ,",
    "the only other source where we have multi - frequency data on the lobes readily available , we find that the same is true  a j - p model provides a good fit to the data from the w lobe provided that the injection index is @xmath8 .",
    "our data are not sensitive enough to take the next step and produce maps of spectral age as a function of position to test whether the spectral ages required are physically reasonable and/or consistent with what is found at lower frequencies .",
    "for the sources with undetected lobes ( 3c220.1 and 3c295 ) we can only set lower limits on the spectral indices of any undetected lobe emission of @xmath9 ( lab frame ) @xmath10 for both sources .",
    "this is consistent with the measured spectral indices in the steepest - spectrum regions of other sources ( fig .",
    "[ spix ] ) and so there is little evidence for a difference in physical behaviour in these two objects .",
    "our observations have now detected at 90 ghz the synchrotron emission from arcsec - scale components of frii radio galaxies seen at lower frequencies : cores , jets , hotspots and lobes .",
    "we can summarize our results and their consequences as follows :    * cores are flat - spectrum up to 90 ghz in most cases , implying that synchrotron self - absorption continues to be important in the cores well above cm wavelengths . *",
    "bright jets are detected and show curved or broken power - law spectra , which is interesting given that the mechanism of particle acceleration in frii jets is not well known at present .",
    "particle acceleration in jets is required for the jets to be visible ( unless they are simply boundary - layer effects ) but is essentially ignored in most models of particle acceleration and energy transport in friis .",
    "the jets we see at 90 ghz are predominantly in objects with atypically bright cm - wavelength jets , though , and it is not clear that they tell us what will be seen when more typical frii sources are observed with higher sensitivity .",
    "* hotspots have been known for some time to be bright sources at 90 ghz and beyond , and are clearly detected in all of our targets that show compact , bright hotspots at lower frequencies .",
    "this is unsurprising given the known detections of hotspots ( including several in our sample ) at infrared , optical and x - ray wavelengths in synchrotron emission .",
    "the wide variety of spectral indices seen between 8 and 90 ghz indicates that hotspots have significantly different electron energy spectra by energies corresponding to 90-ghz synchrotron emission . *",
    "emission from the lobes is not universal but is common in our sample of high - surface - brightness targets ; it comes preferentially from high - surface - brightness regions of lower - frequency emission close to the hotspots .",
    "spectral indices in the lobes between cm and mm wavelengths are typically steep , @xmath11 , and so qualitatively the properties of the lobes are consistent with the standard spectral ageing model . in a few cases we have been able to show quantitative consistency with a jaffe & perola ( 1973 : j - p ) electron spectrum , though in at least one case ( 3c123 ) we have argued elsewhere that reacceleration in the lobes may be required to produce the high - frequency emission .",
    "the observations summarized in this paper give a preview of the components that alma may be expected to detect when it observes frii radio galaxies at frequencies around 90 ghz .",
    "however , alma will have instantaneous sensitivity an order of magnitude higher than bima , substantially better @xmath12 plane coverage , and higher angular resolution .",
    "the increase in our capability to image mm - wave structures in extragalactic radio sources will be comparable to that obtained at cm wavelengths when the vla first became available at the end of the 1970s .",
    "our work here has shown that there are questions that only alma can answer regarding the detailed spectral structure of radio galaxies .",
    "since the synchrotron spectra of lobes , particularly near the hotspots , appear to be cutting off in the mm regime , alma will provide the best possible leverage on models of spectral ageing and therefore of energy transport and particle dynamics in the lobes .",
    "alma should also be able to probe the high - frequency structure of frii jets for the first time .",
    "we emphasise however that these projects will require us to combine mm observations with observations at lower frequencies with instruments like the ( expanded ) vla , bearing in mind that the vla will have greatly increased sensitivity at frequencies of tens of ghz once the evla upgrade is complete .",
    "higher alma frequencies will be of value in studies of hotspots but will probably not probe deep into the lobes , and the increasingly small alma field of view at high frequencies will probably prove restrictive in this respect .",
    "the requirement for complementary observations at lower radio frequencies is a motivation for studies of equatorial samples of lobe - dominated radio galaxies in the run - up to the alma era ( e.g. best , rttgering & lehnert 1999 ) .",
    "one intriguing possible use of alma is in the direct detection of the expected sunzaev - zeldovich ( s - z ) effect from radio galaxy lobes ( enlin & kaiser 2000 ; colafrancesco 2008 ) .",
    "since x - ray inverse - compton emission from the lobes of radio galaxies is now routinely detected ( e.g. kataoka & stawarz 2005 ; croston et al .",
    "2005 ) we know the electron content of radio lobes well enough to make predictions at the level of individual radio galaxies , and signatures of the s - z effect may well in principle be detectable at mm wavelengths , with the possibility of providing information about the low - energy electron spectrum ( colafrancesco 2008 ) .",
    "apart from the weakness of the signal , the major difficulty is the synchrotron emission at these wavelengths .",
    "our work in this paper shows that emission from cores and hotspots is likely to be unavoidable , at least in active radio galaxies as opposed to relics .",
    "however , some hope is provided by the ( limited ) evidence that spectral ageing may be operating as expected at high frequencies in these lobes . in the ( most favourable ) case of effective pitch angle scattering ( i.e. , a j - p spectrum ) , assuming losses dominated by a constant , fully tangled magnetic field of strength @xmath13 , the maximum lorentz factor in the electron spectrum is @xmath14 ( pacholczyk 1970 ) where @xmath15 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath16 is the mass of the electron , @xmath17 is the energy density in the magnetic field ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 is the ageing time .",
    "this energy corresponds to a characteristic ` break ' frequency given by @xmath20 ( longair 1994 ) where @xmath21 is the charge on the electron , and so @xmath22 ( leahy 1991 ) .",
    "as shown graphically by jaffe & perola ( 1973 ) and leahy ( 1991 ) , the synchrotron spectrum rapidly steepens at frequencies at and around @xmath23 .",
    "because the steepening in the j - p spectrum is monotonic , there is a unique value of the break frequency that produces a flux density ratio @xmath24 between two observed frequencies @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( s.t .",
    "@xmath27 ) if the spectrum is a power law at frequencies @xmath28 with a spectral index ( the ` injection index ' ) @xmath2 and @xmath29",
    "[ jpplot ] shows a plot of the log of @xmath24 as a function of @xmath30 for various values of @xmath31 and a plausible choice of @xmath2 .",
    "required values of the break frequency can be read from this plot .",
    "for example , if we know that the flux density at @xmath32 ghz ( source frame ) is 1 jy , which is at the high end of what is observed for a typical 3crr source , and we require the flux density at @xmath33 ghz to be @xmath34 @xmath35jy ( i.e. , well below any detectable s - z effect ) , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and fig.[jpplot ] shows that @xmath38 .",
    "we can then use eq .",
    "[ nub ] to find the required age of the plasma for a given magnetic field strength . for typical observed magnetic fields",
    "@xmath39 nt ( croston et al .",
    "2005 ) we require lobe ages ( i.e. times since particle acceleration ) of @xmath40 years , which will be achieved only in large , old radio galaxies ; ages comparable to this are however found in some spectral ageing studies ( e.g. alexander & leahy 1987 ) . because @xmath41 , fig .",
    "[ jpplot ] shows that these conclusions only change weakly if we are searching for the s - z effect at higher frequencies .",
    "however , there is a strong dependence on the magnetic field strength , so more powerful radio galaxies with higher magnetic field strengths may be better targets .",
    "large radio galaxies are in general the best targets for s - z detections , both because spectral ageing will have had the greatest effect and because the integrated s - z decrement ( for a given low - energy electron spectrum ) is essentially proportional to the energy stored in the lobes , but in practice there will be a tradeoff between these factors and the requirement that the source be well imaged in alma s small field of view .",
    "nevertheless we consider that s - z detection experiments , while challenging , are not completely ruled out by what our observations have shown us about the nature of radio galaxies at alma frequencies .",
    "we emphasise that the calculation we have carried out here assumes that the j - p electron spectrum is a completely accurate description of the lobes .",
    "if there is even a very small amount of local particle reacceleration in radio galaxy lobes , or ( equivalently ) rapid transport of high - energy electrons from the hotspots , then the flat - spectrum radiation produced will completely dominate the mm - wave emission from the lobes in ` old ' regions of plasma far from the hotspots ( potentially in the manner we saw in our observations of 3c123 ; looney & hardcastle 2000 ) .",
    "another way of interpreting the calculations above is that they show alma s ability to provide a very sensitive probe of the degree to which local particle acceleration is important in lobes .",
    "thus deep alma observations of old radio lobes are likely to produce interesting results whether they detect the s - z effect or not .",

    "<S> we have observed a small sample of powerful double radio sources ( radio galaxies and quasars ) at frequencies around 90 ghz with the bima millimetre array , with the intention of constraining the resolved high - frequency spectra of radio galaxies . when combined with other sources </S>",
    "<S> we have previously observed and with data from the bima archive , these observations allow us for the first time to make general statements about the high - frequency behaviour of compact components of radio galaxies  cores , jets and hotspots . </S>",
    "<S> we find that cores in our sample remain flat - spectrum up to 90 ghz ; jets in some of our targets are detected at 90 ghz for the first time in our new observations ; and hotspots are found to be almost universal , but show a wide range of spectral properties . emission from the extended lobes of radio galaxies is detected in a few cases and shows rough consistency with the expectations from standard spectral ageing models , though our ability to probe this in detail is limited by the sensitivity of bima . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss the prospects for radio - galaxy astrophysics with alma .    </S>",
