    "we assume that no two driving frequencies are in approximate resonance to the same transition frequency @xmath12 and on the other hand every driving frequency is in approximate resonance to at least one transition frequency .",
    "there is not much loss of generality in this when considering a qoc problem since this only means that we do not have off resonant controls nor two controls affecting the same transition .",

    "this includes far more than just dropping the counter - rotating term ( one of the terms inside the sum of eq .  ) , as in the more common rwa for two - level systems , but also all terms of the sum of frequencies that are non - resonant to the transition frequency corresponding to that matrix element , reducing the whole sum to only one element .",

    "repeating this step , that is removing @xmath35 , leaves us with the root graph : @xmath37 . in the last three pictures we show how the variables @xmath45 are chosen",

    "as we have seen in the previous sections qoc works very well within the rwa and clearly shows that the number of parameters for optimization has to scale linearly with the dimension @xmath0 of the hilbert space describing the system  @xcite .",
    "the intuitive argument for that is : assume we add an additional frequency @xmath144 to those used to perform an already optimal protocol found previously . if @xmath144 is not in approximate resonance to any transition frequency it can be neglected and will not affect the description in the rwa .",
    "if it is in approximate resonance to any transition frequency , we just keep the new frequency @xmath144 and drop the old one which was on resonance with the same transition . in any case , there is no need to increase the number of frequencies beyond @xmath39 .",
    "this supports the findings of a recent work @xcite where , by means of an information theoretical analysis , it was shown that for an effective optimization the bandwidth of the control field ( in this case given by the number of controls @xmath145 ) has to scale at least linearly with the dimension of the hilbert space associated with the optimized system .",
    "another connection to a recently developed and highly efficient optimization algorithm , namely the chopped random basis algorithm ( crab ) @xcite , can be made : in crab one expands the control pulse @xmath146 into a truncated basis , often using trigonometric polynomials with great effectiveness . in a typically qoc problem , one has @xmath147 where @xmath148 analogously , one can rewrite the hamiltonian in the form @xmath149 which shows a clear one to one relationship between the two methods .",
    "this once again backs the observations made with crab that the number of frequencies necessary for good optimization results is not exceedingly high , in particular it does not grow super - polynomially  @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we investigated the performance of qoc within the generalized rwa applied to a @xmath0-dimensional quantum system . by introducing proper unitary transformations",
    ", we identified an important subset of qoc problems that can be described by a time - independent formalism , namely systems that can be described by acyclic , connected graphs .",
    "we solved the state - to - state transfer problem for the paradigmatic two - level system , and the dynamics of the @xmath0-dimensional system whose graph is a star .",
    "we demonstrated numerically that a system representable by a connected , acyclic graph can be controlled to perform arbitrary state - to - state transfers and we showed that this approach allows to develop an optimal protocol to entangle rydberg atoms with constant laser pulses , that is without the need of schemes for pulse shaping .",
    "let us mention that the subset of connected , acyclic graphs is of natural high interest for qoc since they represent the class of hamiltonians that connect the complete @xmath0-dimensional system dynamics with the fewest possible controls , namely only @xmath39 . reducing the number of controls",
    "further either leaves the graph unconnected or introduces a near - degeneracy , both impeding optimal control .    to give an outlook ,",
    "we stress that the class of qoc problems identified here , despite being quite general , does not include all scenarios where the presented approach can be applied successfully . in particular , even if the graph is not acyclic , there are cases in which the system can still be recast as a time - independent one .",
    "this is the case if the sum over all detunings along this cycle is zero : graphically this means that the phase accumulated is the same no matter which path of the cycle goes  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a step further has been developed to encompass more of the complete system dynamics in a time - independent description by incorporating part of the counter - rotating terms , offering possibilities to enlarge the amount of applications even further .",
